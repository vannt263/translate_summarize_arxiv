    "recently , the information theoretic analysis of fading channels is receiving much attention .",
    "this interest is motivated by the rapid advances in wireless technology and the need to use scarce resources such as bandwidth and power as efficiently as possible under severe fading conditions .",
    "providing the ultimate performance , information theoretic measures such as capacity , spectral efficiency and error exponents can be used as benchmarks to which we can compare the performance of practical communication systems .",
    "furthermore with the recent discovery of codes that operate very close to the shannon capacity , information theoretic limits have gained practical relevance . although the capacity and other information - theoretic measures of fading channels were investigated in as early as the 1960 s ( @xcite , @xcite ) , it is only recently that many interesting fading channel models have been considered under various practically related input and channel constraints .",
    "a significant amount of effort has been expended to study fading channel models where side information about the fading is available at either the receiver or the transmitter or both ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , under fast fading conditions noncoherent communications , where neither party knows the fading , often becomes the only available alternative .",
    "richters @xcite considered the problem of communicating over an average power limited discrete - time memoryless rayleigh fading channel without any channel side information .",
    "he conjectured that the capacity - achieving amplitude distribution is discrete with a finite number of mass points . recently",
    ", abou - faycal _ et al . _",
    "@xcite gave a rigorous proof of richters conjecture .",
    "this result shows that when the fading is known by neither the transmitter nor the receiver , the optimal amplitude distribution has a notably different character than that of unfaded gaussian channels . a similar discrete structure for the optimal input",
    "was also shown in @xcite for the pulse amplitude modulated direct detection photon channel when average and peak power limitations are imposed on the intensity of a photon emitting source .",
    "katz and shamai @xcite considered the noncoherent awgn channel and proved that the optimal input amplitude is discrete with an infinite number of mass points .",
    "lapidoth @xcite recently analyzed the effects of phase noise over the awgn channel , characterizing the high- asymptotics of the channel capacity for a general class of phase noise distributions with memory .",
    "an extensive study of the capacity of multi - antenna fading channels at high was conducted in @xcite .",
    "kennedy @xcite showed that the infinite bandwidth capacity of fading multipath channels is the same as that of the unfaded gaussian channel .",
    "although any set of orthogonal signals achieves this capacity for the unfaded gaussian channel , orthogonal signals that are peaky both in time and frequency are needed in the presence of fading ( * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , for a general class of fading channels , verd @xcite has recently shown that if there are no constraints other than average power , _ flash signaling _ , a class of unbounded peak - to - average ratio inputs defined in @xcite , is necessary to achieve the capacity as @xmath0 when the channel realization is unknown at the receiver .",
    "flash signaling can be practically employed in systems where sudden discharge of energy ( e.g. , using capacitors ) is allowed , thus sidestepping the use of rf amplifiers . however , these peaky signals are not feasible in communication systems subject to strict peak - to - average ratio requirements .",
    "furthermore , in some systems cdma - type white signals which spread their energy over the available bandwidth are used because of their anti - jamming and low probability of intercept capabilities .",
    "hence , it is of interest to investigate the effect upon the capacity of imposing peakedness constraints , especially in the low - power regime .",
    "mdard and gallager @xcite considered noncoherent broadband fading channels with no specular component and limited the peakedness of the input signals by imposing a fourth moment constraint .",
    "then they showed that such a constraint forces the mutual information to zero inversely with increasing bandwidth .",
    "since cdma - type signals spread their energy over the available bandwidth , they satisfy the above fourth moment constraint .",
    "therefore , mdard and gallager conclude that cdma - type white signals can not efficiently utilize fading multipath channels at extremely large bandwidth .",
    "other results on this theme are obtained by telatar and tse @xcite and subramanian and hajek @xcite .    in this paper , we consider the noncoherent discrete - time memoryless rician fading channel and study the capacity and the optimal input structure . in a companion paper [ part ii ] , we further investigate the spectral - efficiency / bit - energy tradeoff in the low - power regime .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : model ] , we introduce the rician fading channel model . in section",
    "[ sec : rician ] , we characterize the structure of the capacity achieving input distribution in the low - power regime when the channel input is constrained to have limited peakedness . in section [ sec : pnrician ] , the average power limited rician fading with phase - noise channel , where there is phase uncertainty in the specular component , is introduced and the structure of the capacity - achieving input is investigated .",
    "numerical results are given in section [ sec : numerical ] , while section [ sec : conclusion ] contains our conclusions .",
    "in this paper , we consider the following discrete - time memoryless rician fading channel model @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are sequences of independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "circular zero mean complex gaussian random variables , independent of each other and of the input , with variances @xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath6 is a deterministic complex constant , @xmath7 is the complex channel input and @xmath8 is the complex channel output . @xmath2 and @xmath3 represent sequences of fading coefficients and background noise samples , respectively .",
    "the rician fading channel model is particularly appropriate when there is a direct line - of - sight ( los ) component in addition to the faded component arising from multipath propagation .",
    "moreover , the rician model includes both the unfaded gaussian channel and the rayleigh fading channel as two special cases .",
    "hence , results obtained for this model provide a unifying perspective .    in the channel model ( [ eq : model ] ) , fading is assumed to be flat and hence has a multiplicative effect on the channel input .",
    "this is a valid assumption if the delay spread of the channel is much smaller than the symbol duration .",
    "moreover , frequency selective fading channels can often be decomposed into parallel non - interacting flat fading subchannels using orthogonal multicarrier techniques .",
    "note also that the fading coefficients assume independent realizations at every symbol period . under such fast fading conditions , reliable estimation of the fading coefficients may be quite difficult because of the short duration between independent fades .",
    "therefore , we consider the noncoherent scenario where neither the receiver nor the transmitter knows the fading coefficients @xmath2 .",
    "in this section , we elaborate on the structure of the capacity achieving input distribution for the rician fading channel when the input has limited peakedness which is achieved by imposing a fourth moment or a peak limitation on the input amplitude .",
    "we first assume that the input amplitude is subject to second and fourth moment constraints : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the average power constraint and @xmath11 . when the average power constraint is active , the fourth moment constraint is equivalent to limiting the kurtosis , @xmath12 , which is a measure of the peakedness of the input signal . for the rician channel model ( [ eq : model ] )",

    "moreover note that @xmath15 is the marginal output density , @xmath16 is the distribution function of the input and @xmath17 denotes the complex plane .",

    "since the conditional distribution has the property @xmath23 for any @xmath21 , it can be easily seen that mutual information is invariant under deterministic rotations of the input distribution and hence @xmath24 . by the concavity of the mutual information over input distributions",
    ", we have @xmath25 . further note that input constraints ( [ eq : constraint1 ] ) and ( [ eq : constraint2 ] ) are also invariant to rotation .",
    "therefore there is no loss in optimality in considering input random variables that has uniformly distributed phase independent of the amplitude .",
    "@xmath26    note that if @xmath27 , we have a rayleigh fading channel where the phase can not be used to convey information when the channel is unknown .",
    "however , if there is a line - of - sight component , i.e. , @xmath28 , phase can indeed carry information and by proposition [ prop : optphase ] , the uniform distribution maximizes the transmission rate .    with this characterization",
    ", we have reduced the optimization problem ( [ eq : cap ] ) to optimal selection of the distribution function of the input amplitude , @xmath29 , under the constraints @xmath30 and @xmath31 . for the sake of simplification in the notation ,",

    "however , if the optimal input has unbounded support , the lhs of the kuhn - tucker condition should be zero infinitely often as @xmath175 .",
    "this constitutes a contradiction and hence the theorem follows .",
    "in general , the number of mass points of the optimal discrete distribution and their locations and probabilities depend on the",

    ". then we test the maximizing two - mass - point discrete distribution with the kuhn - tucker condition .",
    "if this distribution satisfies the necessary and sufficient kuhn - tucker condition , then it is optimal and the mutual information achieved by it is the capacity . as we increase the , the required number of mass points monotonically increases , and therefore to obtain the optimum distribution we repeat the same procedure for discrete distributions with increasing numbers of mass - points .    for the rician fading channel ( @xmath186 ) with second and fourth moment input constraints ,",

    "the nonzero amplitude approaches the origin as @xmath193 while its probability is kept constant . in the rayleigh channel ( @xmath194 ) , ( [ eq : optinput ] ) is still optimal at low @xmath195 up to a point after which , as @xmath195 is further lowered , the second moment constraint becomes inactive and we observe that the nonzero mass point approaches the origin more slowly while its probability decreases . from fig .",
