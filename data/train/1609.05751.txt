    "on going experimental efforts at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and large hadron collider ( lhc ) energies is aimed at to create and characterized the properties of quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "the heavy mesons ( mesons which contain one heavy quark , mainly c and b ) constitute a novel probe of the qgp properties , because they are produced in the early stage of the heavy - ion collisions and they are the witness to the entire space - time evolution of the qgp .",
    "the two main experimental observables related to heavy quarks dynamics in qgp are : ( i ) the nuclear suppression factor , @xmath0  @xcite which is the ratio of the @xmath3 spectra of heavy flavored mesons ( d and b ) produced in nucleus + nucleus collisions to those produced in proton + proton collisions scaled with the number of binary collision and ( ii ) the elliptic flow , @xmath4  @xcite , which is a measure of the anisotropy in the angular distribution of particle production .",
    "several theoretical efforts have been made to study the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 measured in experiments within different models  @xcite ( see also for heavy baryons  @xcite ) .",
    "however all the approaches shown some difficulties to describe both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 simultaneously .",
    "to address the simultaneous description of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we need to focus on the time evolution of @xmath0 and @xmath1 to know how they develop during the expansion of the qgp . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath0 develops mostly at the very early stage of the qgp evolution within 3 - 4 fm / c , while the @xmath1 builds up later and consequently can be transferred to the heavy quarks also only at later stages when the fireball has reached temperatures close to the critical temperature .",
    "this indicates a more liquid - like behavior of the quark - gluon plasma and the t - dependence of the drag coefficient plays a significance role for a simultaneous description of @xmath0 and @xmath1 as they are sensitive to the two different stages of the qgp evolution ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) . to investigate the influence of the temperature dependence of the drag ( and diffusion ) coefficients on heavy quark observables , four different models have been used to calculate the drag and diffusion coefficients .",
    "model - i ( pqcd ) : in this case , the elastic collisions of heavy quarks with the bulk consist of light quarks , anti - quarks and gluons have been considered within the framework of pqcd having temperature dependence of the coupling  @xcite : g^-2(t)=2_0 ln()+lnwhere @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is the number of flavor and @xmath11 is the transition temperature .",
    "+ model - ii ( ads / cft ) : in this second case , we consider the drag force from the gauge / string duality i.e. ads / cft  @xcite , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and the diffusions coefficient deduced from fluctuations - dissipation  @xcite .",
    "+ model - iii ( qpm ) : in this case , we employ a quasi particle model ( qpm )  @xcite with t - dependent quasi - particle masses , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , along with a t - dependent background field known as bag constant , tuned to reproduce the thermodynamics of the lattice qcd . the fit lead to the coupling , @xmath16 ^ 2}$ ] , where @xmath17=2.6 and @xmath18=0.57 .",
    "+ model - iv ( @xmath19 ) : in this fourth case , we consider a model where the light quarks and gluons are massless but the coupling is taken from the qpm model discussed above .",
    "this case is merely a way to obtain a drag increasing toward @xmath6 . +",
    "this fourth case has been considered to have drag coefficient with a t dependence similar to the t - matrix approach  @xcite . in fig  [ drag ] , we have shown the variation of the drag coefficients obtained within the four different model discussed above .",
    "our methodology is to reproduce the same @xmath0 as of the experiments within all the four models , hence , these are the rescaled drag coefficients .     as a function of @xmath3 for the minimum bias . ]     as a function of @xmath3 for the minimum bias . ]     as a function of @xmath3 for the minimum bias . ]",
    "we have solved the langevin dynamics to study the heavy quark momentum evolution in qgp starting from charm quark production in p - p collision  @xcite as the initial charm quark distributions in the momentum space . to simulate the heavy quark dynamics in qgp",
    ", we need the bulk evolution .",
    "we are using the transport bulk which can reproduce the gross features of the bulk i.e the spectra and elliptic flow .",
    "for the @xmath20 collisions at the highest rhic energy , we simulate the qgp evolution with initial temperature in the center of the fireball is @xmath21 mev and the initial time is @xmath22 fm / c . for the detail of the fireball evolution",
    ", we refer to our early works  @xcite .    in fig  [ raa_time1 ]",
    ", we have shown the variation of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath3 for the four different models at rhic energy .",
    "the @xmath1 for the same @xmath0 has been plotted in fig  [ v2_time1 ] for all the four models .",
    "it has been observed that for the same @xmath0 , the @xmath1 build - up can be quite different depending on the t - dependence of the drag coefficients .",
    "larger the drag coefficient at @xmath6 larger is the @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "similar effect has also been observed in the light quark sector  @xcite .",
    "this implys , the correct temperature dependence of the drag coefficient has a vital role for a simultaneous description of heavy quark @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the heavy quark observables are also sensitive to the hadronic rescattering  @xcite , pre - equilibrium phase  @xcite as well as to the time evolution equation i.e where within langevin or boltzmann equation  @xcite . in particular",
    ", the solution of the full two - body collision integral shows that the anisotropic flows are larger respect to those predicted by a langevin dynamics . for details",
    "we refer to our earlier works  @xcite .",
    "in the recent past it has been recognized that a very strong magnetic field  @xcite is created at early times in high energy heavy ion collisions . since",
    "heavy quarks are produced at the very early stage of evolution due to their large mass their dynamics can be affected by such a strong magnetic field  @xcite . the @xmath23 field generated in non - central heavy ion collisions dominated by the component along the @xmath24 axis ,",
    "so its main effect is the induction of a current in the @xmath25 plane . on the other hand the time dependence of @xmath23 generates a electric field by faraday s law ,",
    "@xmath26 which induces a current . for the calculation of the electromagnetic field generated in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collision , we refer to the space - time solution developed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in fig.[em ] we show the time dependence of the @xmath27 and electric field @xmath28 at finite space rapidity @xmath29 in a @xmath30 at @xmath31 at @xmath32 for a medium of @xmath33 .",
    "the impact of the electromagnetic field has been taken into account through the lorentz force as the external force in the langevin equation .",
    "for the detail we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite .    magnetic field introduce a anisotropy which eventually leads to a substantial directed flow , @xmath34 , can be measurable at the experiments . in fig .",
    "[ v1 ] we have presented the resulting directed flow @xmath35 as a function of rapidity for charm ( black solid line ) and anti - charm quarks ( dashed line line ) .",
    "we find a substantial @xmath35 at finite rapidity with a peak at @xmath36 .",
    "the directed flow is negative for negative charged particle ( charm ) at forward rapidity which means that the the magnetic field dominates over the displacement induced by the faraday current ( generated due to the time dependence of the magnetic field ) .",
    "this is a non trivial result and depends not only on the absolute magnitude of the magnetic field but also on the strength of heavy - light quark interaction .",
    "if we artificially increase the drag coefficient by a factor 5 to achieve a thermalization of the charm quarks similar to the light quark one , this will lead to a quite smaller @xmath37 .     as a function of the rapidity in @xmath30 at @xmath38 for d meson [ @xmath39 and anti - d meson [ @xmath40 . ]     as a function of the rapidity in @xmath30 at @xmath38 for d meson [ @xmath39 and anti - d meson [ @xmath40 . ]",
    "in summary , we have presented how the @xmath1 build - up for the same @xmath0 depends on the t - dependence of the interaction ( drag and diffusion coefficients ) which is the key for a simultaneous description of heavy quark @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we have also mentioned how the @xmath1 gets a boost from the boltzmann dynamics by studying the heave quark momentum evolution and from the hadronic rescattering .",
    "we have also studied the heavy quark dynamics in the presence of electromagnetic field .",
    "heavy quark develops a sizable directed flow @xmath41 which could be measurable at experiments .",
    "the present study suggests the heavy quark @xmath35 can be considered as a significant probe to characterize the magnetic field .",
