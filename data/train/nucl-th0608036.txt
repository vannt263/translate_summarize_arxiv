    "there polarized electrons of energy 850 mev circulated in the bates ring and were scattered from an internal target containing polarized deuterium .",
    "the significant amount of beam on target ( 3 million coulombs since late 2003 ) , and high degree of beam and target polarization achieved at blast , means that we anticipate data on electron - deuteron polarization observables that is more precise than that derived from any previous measurement .",
    "the electron beam circulating in the bates ring was roughly 70% polarized , and the deuterium target employed could operate in both a vector - polarized and tensor - polarized mode .",

    "the operator is  @xcite : @xmath162 and is designed to be diagonal in two - body spin and isospin and contribute only for @xmath76 and @xmath163 states . in the case of deuterium it represents an e2 photon inducing a @xmath155s@xmath164s@xmath156 transition .",
    "such a transition is possible because the photon interacts with the total spin of the two - nucleon system through the two - body operator ( [ eq : e2sd ] ) .",
    "the two - nucleon operator ( [ eq : e2sd ] ) will be induced when high - momentum modes in the @xmath2 system are integrated out to obtain the low - momentum effective theory .",
    "it could also be induced when heavy mesons which can couple to a quadrupole photon in the requisite way are integrated out of the @xmath0et .",
    "this heavy - meson origin for the operator leads us to anticipate that with a scale @xmath165 of about 1.2 gev the coupling @xmath166 will be of order 1 . in particular , if we used resonance saturation in the @xmath2 system  @xcite to estimate the size of this operator the first mesonic current that would contribute to the operator would be the @xmath167 current  @xcite .",
    "we now give arguments which demonstrate that physics at roughly this scale could indeed remedy the discrepancy between the experimental @xmath72 and the result found from the mechanisms already discussed .",
    "let us take the accepted number from `` high - quality '' potential models @xmath168 fm@xmath5 ( see , e.g.  ref .",
    "calculations with @xmath0pt wave functions obtain similar , or even slightly smaller , numbers  @xcite .",
    "then , we adopt @xmath170 fm@xmath5 as an estimate for the nlo and nnlo corrections ( which come mainly from the two - body operator @xmath143 ) .",
    "this leaves us with a remaining discrepancy between theory and experiment of 0.008 fm@xmath5 , or about 3% . inserting the operator ( [ eq : e2sd ] ) between deuteron wave functions we obtain its contribution to @xmath72 as : @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the deuteron wave function at the origin . while @xmath172 is not an observable , neither is the dimensionless number @xmath166 : it is a wave - function - regularization dependent coefficient .",
    "since only s - waves contribute at @xmath173 if we assume @xmath174 gev we can constrain the combination of @xmath172 and @xmath166 to be : @xmath175 ^ 2 \\approx 6.5~{\\rm fm}^{-3},\\ ] ] where @xmath176 is the @xmath155s@xmath156 radial wave function .",
    "therefore the operator ( [ eq : e2sd ] ) can be associated with physics at scales of about 1 gev and still remedy the discrepancy between the theoretical value of @xmath72 ( including the meson - exchange contribution to the charge ( [ eq : j02bmutilde ] ) ) and the experimental value ( [ eq : qdexpt ] ) .",
    "this higher - order effect has an importance greater than one would anticipate in weinberg s counting ( [ eq : sum ] ) not because it is unnaturally large , but because , from the point of view of that counting , @xmath72 is unnaturally small  @xcite .",
    "this is hardly a surprise , since , at both leading and next - to - leading order , @xmath72 is generated by one - body operators that connect the deuteron s - state to the deuteron d - state .",
    "such effects are suppressed by the ratio @xmath177  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the operator ( [ eq : e2sd ] ) is not @xmath178-suppressed and so its contribution to @xmath72 is significantly larger than the naive estimate of @xmath179% leads us to anticipate . in this context it is worth noting that such an estimate for the short - distance effects in @xmath180 is completely validated by calculation  @xcite .",
    "the leading - order piece of @xmath160 is of the expected size @xmath181 , and two - body contributions , beginning with effects from @xmath143 and continuing through the two - pion - exchange mechanisms of @xmath182 and the c0-photon short - distance operator of @xmath183 , give contributions of the expected size , approximately @xmath184% .",
    "while this is reassuring , the ( relatively ) large impact of @xmath183 on @xmath81 means that we must ask how well we know this operator .",
    "its value at @xmath153 can be fixed by the requirement that it repair the discrepancy between theory and experiment for @xmath72 .",
    "but at this stage we know nothing about its @xmath11 dependence .",
    "for the purposes of this paper we will assume that this operator arises from heavy - meson exchange , and so model its @xmath11 dependence by : @xmath185 the uncertainty in the operator is now encoded as uncertainty in the scale @xmath46 of its momentum variation .",
    "we anticipate @xmath186 gev , because there are no meson resonances below 1.2 gev which , when integrated out of the theory , will yield this operator .",
    "the only danger with this reasoning is that two - pion - range mechanisms that occur at @xmath159 may ultimately prove to be responsible for the @xmath72 discrepancy .",
    "this possibility is under investigation  @xcite .",
    "however , evaluation of relevant processes in models which calculate , e.g. the role of @xmath187 components in deuterium , suggest that the dominant two - pion - exchange contributions to @xmath183 are not large enough to remedy the @xmath72 discrepancy  @xcite .    as for an upper bound on the value @xmath46 ; the effects of the operator ( [ eq : j05uncert ] )",
    "persist to higher @xmath11 as the scale of its momentum variation is increased . at the @xmath11 s considered here ,",
    "the impact of this operator on observables when we choose @xmath188 gev is within 30% of what one would obtain at @xmath189 , so we will vary @xmath46 between 1.2 and 2 gev in order to assess the theoretical uncertainty of our calculation .",
    "we will see below that even with this range of variation our ignorance as to the precise value of @xmath46 ( or the precise function of @xmath11 that modulates the current @xmath183 ) is the dominant contribution to our theoretical uncertainty in the ratio @xmath1 .",
    "our goal in introducing the @xmath11-dependence ( [ eq : j05uncert ] ) into our calculation is to assess the potential impact on our @xmath0et calculation from physics that is not explicitly included in it .",
    "the @xmath11-dependence of @xmath143 will be modified by these sorts of effects , as well as by higher - order loop contributions that can be calculated in the @xmath0et . however ,",
    "once such higher - order calculations are carried out the @xmath11-dependence of @xmath143 can presumably be constrained by input from electro - production in the single - nucleon sector .",
    "therefore here we take the operator @xmath143 as given . when we quote ranges for its impact on observables those ranges arise from the fact that @xmath190 varies when evaluated with different deuteron wave functions .",

    "a conservative estimate for the impact of short - distance physics which is not well - constrained in this @xmath0et calculation is given by combining the uncertainties from @xmath193 variation and the uncertainty coming from lack of knowledge about the momentum dependence of @xmath183 .",
    "the black bars then represent the range of possible values that the @xmath0et predicts for @xmath1 at the kinematics where there will be data from blast .",
    "these ranges are reproduced in table  [ table - blastpreds ] .",
    "the error is about @xmath194% at the lowest blast point and increases with @xmath11 , as it should .",
    "note that we have not included the n@xmath60lo @xmath0et wave function , or the nlo @xmath0et wave function , in generating these predictions .",
    "as already discussed , the predictions for @xmath19 and @xmath8 with the n@xmath60lo wave function deviate already from the extant data at quite low @xmath11 , while the nlo wave function is , in the @xmath0et sense , less accurate than the operator being used here .",
    "the predictions obtained with these wave functions are , however , within 2@xmath195 , if the theoretical error bars we have obtained are taken to have the usual one - standard - deviation interpretation .",

[ fig - gcovergm ] are accurate to relative order @xmath103 , although the @xmath19 used here is actually computed up to relative order @xmath197 .",

    "[ fig - gcovergm ] , due to short - distance contributions to @xmath14 being different for different wave functions .",
    "however , even without renormalization there is a robust prediction for the ratio out to @xmath198 gev@xmath5 .",
    "the robust prediction is that @xmath10 is approximately flat",
    ". this would be exactly the case in the absence of relativistic , meson - exchange , and nucleon - structure contributions to the operator , and if @xmath199 .",
    "the relativistic corrections at @xmath55 are negligible at @xmath200 gev@xmath5 , and the meson - exchange piece of the charge operator is higher order than we are attempting to calculate the ratio @xmath10 to . as far as the operator is concerned this leaves only the nucleon - structure effects , which depend on the ratio : @xmath201 if a strict chiral expansion is used for the form factors then this ratio depends ( again , at this order ) on the difference of the isoscalar magnetic and charge radii , and amounts to a @xmath202% effect at @xmath203 gev@xmath5 .",
    "even though taking the ratio @xmath10 does not ( as it did in the case of the ratio of the previous section ) eliminate nucleon - structure effects , it does reduce their size .",
    "meanwhile , the effects of @xmath204 grow with @xmath11 , and so at @xmath205 gev@xmath5 it is thus not particularly surprising that @xmath42 is , to quite a good approximation , flat .",
    "given the extent of the variation in the prediction for the ratio beyond @xmath206 mev it is difficult to believe that the nlo predictions for the ratio shown here are reliable beyond that point .",
    "this situation could improve once the nnlo pieces of the operator @xmath101 were computed , but short - distance pieces of @xmath207 appear already at that order .",
    "therefore it is a prediction of the chiral expansion that this ratio will be more sensitive to short - distance physics than is @xmath1 .",
