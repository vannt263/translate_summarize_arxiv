    "the aw , rascle @xcite and zhang @xcite ( arz ) model is a second order system describing vehicular traffic . in its continuum formulation , it can be written as the @xmath2 system of conservation laws in one space dimension @xmath3_t + \\left[\\rho \\ , v \\ , ( v+p(\\rho))\\right]_x = 0,&t > 0 , ~ x\\in { \\mathbb{r}}. \\end{cases}\\ ] ]    the conserved variables @xmath4 and @xmath5 $ ] describe respectively the _ density _ and the _ generalized momentum _ of the system .",
    "@xmath6 is the _",
    "velocity_. the quantity @xmath7 is called _",
    "lagrangian marker_. the function @xmath8 in is the _ pressure function _ and accounts for drivers reactions to the state of traffic in front of them . while traffic flow is one of the main motivating applications behind the system , we see a growing interest nowadays on different contexts as crowd dynamics and bio - mathematics .    the instability near the vacuum state makes the mathematical theory for a challenging topic .",
    "for this reason , as in @xcite , we study in the riemann invariant coordinates @xmath9 and use the following expressions for the density @xmath10    it is well known since @xcite and the earlier works @xcite ( see also a related result in @xcite ) that the discrete lagrangian counterpart of is provided by the second order _ follow - the - leader _ system @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are location of the tail and speed of the @xmath14-th vehicle at time @xmath15 . in terms of the discrete lagrangian marker @xmath16 the system reads in the simpler form @xmath17 the simpler form highlights the fact that the follow - the - leader system describes a particle system with _",
    "many species_. hence is a microscopic _ multi population _",
    "model , in which the @xmath14-th vehicle has length @xmath18 $ ] and maximal speed @xmath19 , which are constant in time and depend on the initial datum of the lagrangian marker .",
    "the goal of this paper is to approximate ( under reasonable assumptions on @xmath8 ) the @xmath2 system of nonlinear conservation laws with the first order microscopic model , that describes a multi population interacting many particle system .",
    "the technique we adopt is a slight variation of that introduced in @xcite , which applies to the approximation of first order lwr models @xcite by a ( simpler ) first order version of the follow - the - leader system . despite the second order nature of",
    ", the strategy developed in @xcite applies also in this case ( see also @xcite for other applications of the techniques introduced in @xcite ) .",
    "this reveals that the multi - species nature of the arz model is quite relevant in the dynamics .",
    "our rigorous results only deal with the convergence toward a weak solution to .",
    "the problem of the uniqueness of entropy solutions for is quite a hard task , and we do not address it here , see @xcite . our main convergence result is stated in theorem  [ thm : main ] below .",
    "we also perform numerical simulations that suggest that the solution of the microscopic model converges to a solution of the macroscopic model as the number of particles goes to infinity .",
    "in particular , we will make the tests considered in @xcite to show that we do not have the spurious oscillations generated , for instance , by the godunov method near contact discontinuities .",
    "we will also make the test considered in @xcite to show that our algorithm is able to cope with the vacuum .",
    "our approach deeply differ from the one proposed in @xcite .",
    "indeed , there the authors show how the arz model written in _",
    "lagrangian mass coordinates _ can be viewed _",
    "away from the vacuum _ as the limit of a _ time discretization _ of a _ second order _ microscopic model as the number of vehicles increases , with a scaling in space and time ( a zoom ) for which the density and the velocity remain fixed . on the contrary",
    ", we consider the arz model written in the eulerian coordinates , so that the vacuum is a state eventually achieved by the solutions , and we introduce the underlying microscopic model without performing any time discretization .",
    "we recall that the numerical transport - equilibrium scheme proposed in @xcite is based on both a ( glimm ) random sampling strategy and the godunov method . as a consequence ,",
    "this method is non - conservative .",
    "moreover , it can not be applied in the presence of the vacuum state . on the contrary ,",
    "our method is conservative and is able to cope with the vacuum .",
    "let us finally underline that the approximate solutions constructed with both methods have sharp ( without numerical diffusion ) contact discontinuities and show numerical convergence .",
    "we remark that the model can be formulated also with a relaxation term with a prescribed equilibrium velocity , see @xcite .",
    "we shall apply our approach to such an extended version of the arz model in a future work .",
    "the present paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : pre ] we recall the basic properties of the discrete follow - the - leader model and of the continuum arz system .",
    "in particular we prove a discrete maximum principle in lemma  [ lem:1 ] which was not present in the literature to our knowledge . in section  [ sec : ato ] we construct the atomization scheme and prove its convergence in the theorem  [ thm : main ] . in section  [ sec : numerics ]",
    "we perform numerical tests with simple riemann problems , including cases with vacuum .",
    "in this section we recall basic facts about the arz model and the discrete follow - the - leader system .",
    "consider the cauchy problem for the arz model @xmath20 where @xmath9 is the unknown variable and @xmath21 is the corresponding initial datum .",
    "more precisely , @xmath9 belongs to @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the corresponding density , where @xmath240,+\\infty\\right[;{\\mathbb{r}}_+)$ ] satisfies @xmath25    in @xcite the authors consider @xmath26^\\gamma , & \\gamma>0\\,,\\\\[7pt ] v_{\\rm ref } \\ ,",

    "the above choice reduces to the original one proposed in @xcite when @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "we also recall that in @xcite the authors consider @xmath31    by definition , we have that the vacuum state @xmath32 corresponds to the half line @xmath33 and the non - vacuum states @xmath34 to @xmath35 . as in @xcite , we consider initial data @xmath36 such that @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 denote the traces of @xmath21 along a lipschitz curve of jump ( see @xcite for a precise formulation of the regularity of @xmath0 functions ) and @xmath40 the introduction of the condition to select the physically reasonable initial data of in the riemann invariant coordinates is motivated in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark  2.1 ) .",
    "we emphasise that such condition is not needed in the proof of our main analytical result .",
    "however , is partly motivated by our numerical tests .",
    "following @xcite , we use the following definition for weak solutions of .",
    "[ def : weak ] let @xmath41 .",
    "we say that a function @xmath42 is a weak solution of if it satisfies the initial condition @xmath43 for a.e .",

    "let us briefly recall the main properties of the solutions to .",
    "if the initial density @xmath47 has compact support , then the support of @xmath4 has finite speed of propagation .",
    "the maximum principle holds true in the riemann invariant coordinates @xmath9 , but not in the conserved variables @xmath48 as a consequence of hysteresis processes .",
    "moreover , the total space occupied by the vehicles ( if they were packed `` nose to tail '' ) is time independent : @xmath49 for all @xmath50 .",
    "we remark that a simple byproduct of our result is an alternative proof of the existence of weak solutions in the sense of definition  [ def : weak ] .",
    "multi population microscopic models of vehicular traffic are typically based on the so called follow - the - leader ( ftl ) model .",
    "consider @xmath51 $ ] ordered particles localised on @xmath52 .",
    "denote by @xmath53 the position of the @xmath14-th particle for @xmath54 .",
    "then , according to the ftl model , the evolution of the particles ( which mimics the evolution of the position of @xmath51 $ ] vehicles along the road ) is described inductively by the following cauchy problem for a system of ordinary differential equations @xmath55 where @xmath56 @xmath57 are @xmath51 $ ] strictly positive constants , @xmath58 satisfies , and @xmath59 are the initial positions of the particles . the quantity @xmath60 is the maximum possible velocity allowed for the @xmath14-th particle",
    "clearly , only the leading particle @xmath61 reaches its maximal velocity @xmath62 , as the vacuum state is achieved only ahead of @xmath61 .",
    "the quantity @xmath63 is the _ maximum discrete density _ of the @xmath14-th particle , so that @xmath64 is the _ length _ of the @xmath14-th particle , @xmath65 and we assume that at time @xmath66 @xmath67    system can be solved inductively starting from @xmath68 .",
    "indeed , we immediately deduce that @xmath69 then , we can compute @xmath53 once we know @xmath70 .",
    "in fact , according with the system the velocity of the @xmath14-th particle depends on its distance from the @xmath71-th particle alone via the smooth velocity map @xmath72 . in order to ensure that the ( unique ) solution to exists globally in time , we need to prove that the distances @xmath73 $ ] never degenerate .",
