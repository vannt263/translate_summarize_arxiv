    "cycle double cover_. in fact , it was conjectured by celmins  @xcite and preissmann  @xcite that every graph has a cycle cover comprised of five cycles .",
    "the cycle double cover conjecture is related to other deep conjectures in graph theory . in particular , it is known to be implied by the shortest cycle cover conjecture of alon and tarsi  @xcite which asserts that every bridgeless graph with @xmath0 edges has a cycle cover of total length at most @xmath5 . recall that the _ length _ of a cycle is the number of edges contained in it and the length of a cycle cover is the sum of the lengths of its cycles .",
    "the reduction of the cycle double cover conjecture to the shortest cycle cover conjecture can be found in the paper of jamshy and tarsi  @xcite .",
    "the best known general result on short cycle covers is due to alon and tarsi  @xcite and bermond , jackson and jaeger  @xcite : every bridgeless graph with @xmath0 edges has a cycle cover of total length at most @xmath6 .",
    "there are numerous results on short cycle covers for special classes of graphs , e.g. , graphs with no short cycles , highly connected graphs or graphs admitting a nowhere - zero @xmath7-/@xmath8-flow , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the reader is referred to the monograph of zhang  @xcite for further exposition of such results where an entire chapter is devoted to results on the shortest cycle cover conjecture .",
    "the least restrictive of refinements of the general bound of alon and tarsi  @xcite and bermond , jackson and jaeger  @xcite are the bounds for cubic graphs .",
    "jackson  @xcite showed that every cubic bridgeless graph with @xmath0 edges has a cycle cover of total length at most @xmath9 and fan  @xcite later showed that every such graph has a cycle cover of total length at most @xmath3 . in this paper , we strengthen this bound in two different ways .",
    "first , we improve it to @xmath2 for _ cubic _ bridgeless graphs .",
    "and second , we show that the bound @xmath10 also holds for @xmath0-edge bridgeless graphs with _ minimum degree three _ , i.e. , we extend the result from  @xcite on cubic graphs to all graphs with minimum degree three .",
    "as in  @xcite , the cycle covers that we construct consist of at most three cycles .    though the improvements of the original bound of @xmath11 on the length of a shortest cycle cover of an @xmath0-edge bridgeless graph can seem to be rather minor , obtaining a bound below @xmath12 for a significant class of graphs might be quite challenging since the bound of @xmath13 is implied by tutte s @xmath8-flow conjecture  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec - prelim ]",
    ", we introduce auxiliary notions and results needed for our main results .",
    "we demonstrate the introduced notation in section  [ sec - intermezzo ] where we reprove the bound @xmath14 of alon and tarsi  @xcite and bermond , jackson and jaeger  @xcite using our terminology . in sections  [ sec - cubic ] and  [ sec - mindegree ]",
    ", we prove our bounds for cubic graphs and graphs with minimum degree three .",
    "in this section , we introduce notation and auxiliary concepts used throughout the paper .",
    "we focus on those terms where confusion could arise and refer the reader to standard graph theory textbooks , e.g.  @xcite , for exposition of other notions .",
    "graphs considered in this paper can have loops and multiple ( parallel ) edges . if @xmath15 is a set of edges of a graph @xmath4",
    ", @xmath16 denotes the graph with the same vertex set with the edges of @xmath15 removed .",
    "if @xmath17 , we simply write @xmath18 instead of @xmath19 . for an edge @xmath20 of @xmath4 , @xmath21 is the graph obtained by contracting the edge @xmath20 , i.e. , @xmath21 is the graph with the end - vertices of @xmath20 identified , the edge @xmath20 removed and all the other edges , including new loops and parallel edges , preserved .",
    "note that if @xmath20 is a loop , then @xmath22 .",
    "finally , for a set @xmath15 of edges of a graph @xmath4 , @xmath23 denotes the graph obtained by contracting all edges contained in @xmath15 .",
    "if @xmath4 is a graph and @xmath24 is a vertex of @xmath4 of degree two , then the graph obtained from @xmath4 by _ suppressing _ the vertex @xmath24 is the graph obtained from @xmath4 by contracting one of the edges incident with @xmath24 , i.e. , the graph obtained by replacing the two - edge path with the inner vertex @xmath24 by a single edge .",
    "an _ edge - cut _ in a graph @xmath4 is a set @xmath15 of edges such that the vertices of @xmath4 can be partitioned into two sets @xmath25 and @xmath26 such that @xmath15 contains exactly the edges with one end - vertex in @xmath25 and the other in @xmath26 .",
    "such an edge - cut is also denoted by @xmath27 .",
    "note that edge - cuts need not be minimal sets of edges whose removal increases the number of components of @xmath4 .",
    "an edge forming an edge - cut of size one is called a _",
    "bridge _ and graphs with no edge - cuts of size one are said to be _",
    "bridgeless_. note that we do not require bridgeless graphs to be connected .",
    "the quantity @xmath28 denotes the number of edges with one end - vertex in @xmath29 and the other vertex in @xmath30 ; in particular , if @xmath27 is an edge - cut of @xmath31 , then @xmath32 is its size .",
    "a graph @xmath4 with no edge - cuts of odd size less than @xmath33 is said to be _ @xmath33-odd - connected_. for every set @xmath34 of edges of  @xmath4 , edge - cuts in  @xmath35 correspond to edge - cuts ( of the same size ) in  @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath4  has no edge - cuts of size  @xmath33 , then @xmath35 also has no edge - cuts of size  @xmath33 .",

    ", we will first modify the graph under consideration in such a way that some of its edges must get the same flow value .",
    "this goal will be achieved by splitting some of the vertices of the graph .",

    "is contained in either @xmath188 or @xmath189 and for every circuit @xmath212 of @xmath34 at most half of its edges are also contained in @xmath190 .",
