    "over several decades the interest in iron ( ii ) phthalocyanine ( fepc ) has been motivated by various applications as well as by its proximity to iron proteins . in more recent times fepc",
    "has become popular as a model system for core - level spectroscopy ( xas , xmcd ) studies.@xcite certain progress has been made in creating artificial ordered structures of fepc.@xcite perhaps the most significant finding of the recent decade was the discovery of an unquenched orbital moment of iron in fepc by means of in - field mssbauer spectroscopy@xcite and xmcd.@xcite    this has in turn brought about a surge of computational activity on fepc . along with various density - functional calculations,@xcite",
    "it is worth to mention multiplet structure calculations@xcite based on a phenomenological model .",
    "the main ingredients of the latter approach are the coulomb repulsion , allowed for by way of the slater - condon parameters , and the crystal ( ligand ) field ( cf ) on fe@xmath9 .",
    "the multiplet calculations@xcite were mainly aimed at simulating x - ray absorption spectra ; however , they produced an interesting by - product .",
    "this is a map of ground states of fe@xmath9 in cf parameter space ( fig . 2 of ref .",
    "an early version of such a diagram for the point group @xmath10 was produced by knig and schnakig,@xcite but the idea itself goes back to the classical work of tanabe and sugano,@xcite who dealt with the cubic symmetry .",
    "unfortunately , in the case of @xmath10 one can not plot but 2-dimensional sections of the 3-dimensional space of cf parameters , the choice of these sections in refs . and being rather suboptimal . besides , the diagrams in refs . and have the disadvantage that cf parameters in energy units are plotted on the axes , and so the diagrams depend on the slater - condon ( or racah ) parameters employed . as against that",
    ", the original work of tanabe and sugano@xcite presented the result in terms of a dimensionless ratio of the cf parameter to racah s @xmath11 , which led to the celebrated series of universal diagrams .",
    "still , miedema s diagrams are of interest .",
    "they have an enigmatic cornered shape , the domain boundaries are piecewise - linear , with repeatedly encountered , characteristic slopes .",
    "these features of the diagrams have so far remained unexplained .",
    "as regards agreement with experiment , the calculations leave much to be desired .",
    "density - functional calculations make inconclusive predictions of the ground state .",
    "thus , reynolds and figgis@xcite could not decide between @xmath1 and @xmath12 because the two lie too close in energy .",
    "marom and kronik@xcite found either @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) or @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , depending on computational details .",
    "@xcite more recently , nakamura et al.@xcite found @xmath14 in an isolated fepc molecule , but @xmath1 in a columnar stack of such molecules .",
    "establishing the symmetry of the ground state does not settle the dispute : within the correct @xmath1 one should further distinguish between the configurations @xmath16 , as conjectured by dale et al.,@xcite and @xmath17 , found in the multiplet calculations.@xcite the two ground - state configurations lead to distinct types of magnetic behavior .",
    "this work aims at determining the cf parameters of fe(ii ) phthalocyanine . as we will show below ,",
    "the known experimental facts on that compound ( obtained by magnetic and spectroscopic measurements ) in connection with our cf analysis leave no choice : there is only one domain in the field of cf parameters yielding a ground state that does not contradict established knowledge . in such a way our calculations resolve the confusing puzzle about the ground state of fepc that existed for many years . as a byproduct",
    "the peculiar shape of miedema s diagrams is explained .    in the following ,",
    "we consider the @xmath18 configuration in a cf of symmetry @xmath10 and allow for coulomb repulsion between the @xmath8 electrons .",
    "the cf is _ a priori _ assumed neither strong nor weak as compared with the coulomb interaction .",
    "hybridization of the fe @xmath8 orbitals to neighboring ligands is thought to be included into the relevant cf parameters . in that sense",
    "it is better to call our theory ligand field theory instead .",
    "but the ligand @xmath19 orbitals are not treated in an explicit way and we keep the term cf theory for simplicity .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling is neglected at first ( since it is much weaker than either the cf or the coulomb repulsion ) but taken into account in a later discussion of magnetic properties .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly review the experimental facts that bear on our knowledge of the ground state of fepc and reiterate the current status of this knowledge .",
    "further , in section iii , a diagram of ground states of fepc is constructed from numerical calculations .",
    "our diagram is similar to that of ref .",
    ", the main two differences being that ( i ) dimensionless coordinates of the tanabe - sugano type are used and ( ii ) the section of the 3-dimensional space of cf parameters is chosen on the principle that the coordination polyhedron is a plane square . in section iv , the same diagram is reproduced analytically , which includes explicit expressions for all domain boundaries .",
    "the subsequent discussion in section v hinges upon the good agreement of the exact ( numerical ) and approximate ( analytical ) diagrams .",
    "the piecewise - linear shape of the domain boundaries finds a natural explanation in the linearity of the underlying equations .",
    "a conclusion is made that fepc is in a strong cf mode and approximate values of the cf parameters are given ( or rather , ratios of cf parameters to racah s @xmath2 ) .",
    "the ground - state configuration turns out to be @xmath17 ( @xmath1 ) , as in refs . .",
    "section vi recapitulates the conclusions .",
    "as early sources of our knowledge of the ground state of fepc one usually cites magnetic susceptibility studies of @xmath20-fepc powder@xcite and single crystals.@xcite the experimental data of both papers are in reasonable agreement with each other . at temperatures between 100 and 300",
    "k the susceptibility follows the curie - weiss law with @xmath21 ( for powder ) .",
    "this is between the spin - only values of @xmath22 for @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively ) .",
    "below about 20 k the susceptibility of @xmath20-fepc becomes temperature - independent .",
    "these facts found an explanation in a simple model with @xmath23 and effective @xmath27-factors employed in both works.@xcite the spectrum of the model consists of a singlet ground state with @xmath28 and an excited doublet with @xmath29 situated at @xmath30 @xmath31 .",
    "it is unclear why dale et al.@xcite thought to justify this model by proposing @xmath16 ( @xmath1 ) as the ground configuration ( and calling it an orbital singlet ) .",
    "their work contains no experimental evidence of @xmath1 being the ground state of fepc .",
    "barraclough et al.@xcite noticed the discrepancy between the orbitally degenerate @xmath1 and dale s assertion that the ground state should be an orbital singlet , and postulated @xmath12 instead .",
    "as pointed out in ref .",
    ", this was no proof , @xmath14 could have done equally well .    the model used in refs . and is not without its difficulties .",
    "so , it can not explain the presence of an excited state ( or states ) at @xmath32 @xmath31 , as pointed out in ref . .",
    "the existence of such an excited state follows from the fact that the susceptibility deviates from the curie - weiss law above room temperature , as observed by lever.@xcite ( a slight downward curvature is also visible in @xmath33 vs @xmath34 data obtained more recently on @xmath35-fepc.@xcite ) this can be viewed as an argument in favor of @xmath1 rather than an orbital singlet .",
    "the six - fold degenerate @xmath1 would be split by the spin - orbit interaction into 4 singlets and a doublet , the overall splitting being @xmath36 @xmath31 .",
    "the observed susceptibility behavior would find a plausible explanation if one of the singlets was the ground state , the doublet ( or a quasi - doublet ) was situated at @xmath30 @xmath31 , and a further state ( or states ) at @xmath32 @xmath31 .",
    "another difficulty of dale s triplet model consists in the values of the @xmath27-factors , which differ significantly from 2 .",
    "thus , dale et al.@xcite obtain @xmath37 ( and @xmath38 ) .",
    "that is , nearly one bohr magneton has to come from an orbital moment .",
    "such a large orbital contribution is explained more naturally by the presence of an unquenched orbital moment ( i.e. , by orbital degeneracy of the ground state ) rather than by mixing in of excited states .",
    "we note that barraclough et al.,@xcite who assert most emphatically the equivalence of their approach to that of ref .",
    ", obtained an isotropic @xmath27-factor , @xmath39 . generally speaking , barraclough",
    "s @xmath27-factors should be more trustworthy , since they were deduced from data measured on a single crystal.@xcite the difficulty , however , is that , according to eq .",
    "( 4 ) of ref .",
    ", the zero - field splitting must vanish for @xmath40 . at the same time",
    ", it is emphasized that this splitting , @xmath30 @xmath31 , is very large.@xcite    in any case , it should be regarded as firmly established that the susceptibility is a maximum in the plane of the fepc molecule.@xcite this conclusion has been recently confirmed in an independent experiment.@xcite as regards the ground states conjectured to explain the susceptibility data , they can not be viewed as deduced from experiment .",
    "an x - ray diffraction experiment of coppens et al.@xcite found the occupation numbers of the fe 3d orbitals in fepc : @xmath41 . on account of covalency ,",
    "these numbers sum up to 5.41 rather than 6 . restoring the normalization to 6",
    ", one has @xmath42 .",
    "coppens et al .",
    "regarded their result as a direct confirmation of dale s conjecture , @xmath16 ( @xmath1 ) . yet , the analysis in ref .",
    "was limited to spin - triplet states .",
    "an unprejudiced look at the quintet states , in particular at @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) , suggests a higher degree of agreement with coppens results .",
    "however , @xmath44 can be ruled out because it would have resulted in too high a magnetic moment , @xmath45 .",
    "turning now to the optical absorption experiments of stillman and thomson,@xcite we note that they were carried out on fepc solution in dichlorobenzene .",
    "this system is chemically distinct from either the free fepc molecule or @xmath35 or @xmath20 fepc .",
    "therefore , without casting doubt upon stillman and thomson s assertion of a @xmath14 ground state , we state merely that their result is not relevant to the system under consideration herein .    a mssbauer spectroscopy study of filoti et al.@xcite found in @xmath35-fepc a very large ( 66 t ) hyperfine field on @xmath46fe .",
    "unlike the usual fermi s contact field , the hyperfine field in @xmath35-fepc has a positive sign ( meaning @xmath47 ) and can only originate from a large unquenched orbital moment .",
    "the latter was estimated to be about 1,@xcite but no definite information about its orientation could be obtained .    a more recent xmcd experiment of bartolom et al.@xcite found in fepc an orbital moment of @xmath48 lying in the plane of the molecule . in the same work@xcite",
    "it was demonstrated by direct measurements that the plane of the molecule contains the easy magnetization direction , in agreement with the early finding of barraclough et al.@xcite    to summarize the section , there is no experimental evidence of the ground state of fepc being either @xmath12 or @xmath14 . nor",
    "do coppens data@xcite provide sufficient confirmation for dale s conjecture of @xmath49 ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "all one can say at this point is that it should be a @xmath1 state endowed with magnetic anisotropy of an easy - plane kind .",
    "the cf hamiltonian operating on a single @xmath8 electron in a tetragonal ( @xmath10 ) environment is written as follows : @xmath50 here @xmath51 are stevens operator equivalents@xcite in the @xmath52-representation ( @xmath53 ) : @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 ; @xmath57 are cf parameters . in older literature one sometimes comes across ballhausen s cf parameters.@xcite these are related to the @xmath57 s in a simple way : @xmath58 it is well known that the five real @xmath59 orbitals belong to distinct irreducible representations of the point group @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , in the basis of those orbitals the cf hamiltonian ( [ hcf ] ) takes a diagonal form , the eigenvalues being@xcite @xmath60 note that ballhausen s original equations ( 5 - 14 ) and ( 5 - 15 ) need to be augmented with the cubic terms , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively , before being converted to the stevens notation by means of eqs .",
    "( [ ballh ] ) .",
    "so far no restrictions have been imposed on the cf , except that it should be compatible with the point group @xmath10 . yet , much more is known about the structure of the fepc molecule than just the symmetry of the fe site .",
    "thus , the nearest environment of the iron atom consists of four nitrogen atoms making a plane square , the fe - n bonds being aligned with either the @xmath63 or the @xmath64 axis .",
    "this fact enables us to reduce the number of independent cf parameters by one . a rather general cf model known as the superposition model ( see ref . for a comprehensive review ) , relates pairs of cf parameters @xmath57 with equal @xmath65 on the basis of shape of the coordination polyhedron . omitting the rather straightforward calculations , we state the result : for a plane square",
    "the superposition model demands that @xmath66      our calculations dealt with a hamiltonian consisting of the cf ( [ hcf ] ) and the coulomb repulsion and operating on the @xmath18 configuration .",
    "the basis states were taken in the form of simple products of one - electron @xmath59 orbitals , @xmath67 with @xmath68 , and @xmath69 .",
    "there are @xmath70 such states in total .",
    "nonzero matrix elements of @xmath71 ( [ hcf ] ) are of two kinds .",
    "first of all , there are diagonal matrix elements , given by @xmath72 secondly , there are nonzero matrix elements between the states ( [ prod ] ) that differ in one pair of quantum numbers @xmath73 , @xmath73 being @xmath74 in one of the states and @xmath75 in the other one .",
    "all such matrix elements equal @xmath76 .",
    "the matrix elements of the coulomb repulsion have been treated extensively in the literature .",
    "here we follow griffith s fundamental treatise.@xcite again , there are two distinct kinds of nonzero matrix elements .",
    "the diagonal ones are given by @xmath77 \\label{diagcoul}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 are the slater - condon parameters ( @xmath79 ) and @xmath80 the integral in eq .",
    "( [ gaunt ] ) is known as the gaunt coefficient .",
    "numerical values of @xmath81 were taken from table 4.4 of griffith s book.@xcite the inner sum in eq .",
    "( [ diagcoul ] ) is taken over all 15 pairs of filled @xmath59 orbitals .",
    "the first term in brackets describes the so - called coulomb contribution , while the second one , relevant to pairs of orbitals with parallel spins only , is the exchange contribution .",
    "the coulomb repulsion also has off - diagonal matrix elements .",
    "these are nonzero only between the states with equal @xmath82 and @xmath83 that differ in two occupied @xmath59 orbitals , say , @xmath84 and @xmath85 in state # 1 , as against @xmath86 and @xmath87 in state # 2 .",
    "it must hold that @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the matrix element between the states # 1 and # 2 is expressed as follows @xmath90 @xmath91 \\label{offdiagcoul}\\ ] ] thus , the matrix elements of the hamiltonian are linear combinations of the cf parameters , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 , as well as the slater - condon parameters , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 .",
    "the latter are conveniently replaced by the racah parameters , @xmath98 the parameter @xmath99 is hereafter set to zero , because its only effect is to shift the energies of all the states of @xmath100 by the same amount , @xmath101 .",
    "the calculation consisted in setting and numerically diagonalizing the hamiltonian matrix for given sets of parameters @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath11 , @xmath2 , and subsequently determining the degeneracy of the ground state .",
    "five characteristic values of degeneracy were encountered : @xmath102 at this stage the ground states are labeled tentatively .",
    "so @xmath99 can be anything of the following : @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , or @xmath106 , which we are unable to distinguish .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath107=@xmath1 and @xmath108=@xmath109 as will be explained in section iv .",
    "the construction of the diagram ( figure [ numerical ] ) was organized as follows .",
    "all energies were expressed in the units of the racah parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the ratios @xmath110 and @xmath111 were treated as independent variables defined on a dense mesh . in the spirit of tanabe and sugano,@xcite",
    "the ratio @xmath112 was fixed to a value appropriate for fe@xmath9 , @xmath113 , as in table 7.3 of ref . .",
    "the cf parameter @xmath94 was not regarded as an independent one .",
    "rather , it was found from eq .",
    "( [ superpos ] ) , as prescribed by the superposition model.@xcite as a result , the @xmath5 plane was partitioned into domains of five different kinds , according to the degeneracy found at each point .",
    "the diagram ( figure [ numerical ] ) has a cornered shape reminiscent of the diagrams in refs . and .",
    "the domain boundaries appear straight lines with characteristic slopes .",
    "several sets of parallel lines are encountered .",
    "the central part of the diagram is an area of weak cf ; in compliance with hund s first rule , the ground state here has @xmath24 .",
    "the periphery of figure [ numerical ] is a region of strong cf ; here @xmath114 or 1 .",
    "partition of cf parameter space among differently degenerate ground states , as found from numerical calculations in the absence of spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the possible ground states are denoted according to their total spin and the absence ( @xmath115 ) or presence ( @xmath116 ) of orbital degeneracy .",
    "they will be further specified in figure [ analytic].,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    the numerical calculations have the advantage of producing an immediate graphical result .",
    "however , it is not easy to analyze the character of a ground state expressed in a 210-dimensional basis .",
    "of special interest to us is @xmath1 , which appears in six non - adjacent domains in figure [ numerical ] .",
    "so we would like to know if those @xmath1 are similar or distinct .",
    "furthermore , we would like to find out the origin of the cornered shape of the diagram , why the boundaries are straight and the slopes repeated .",
    "finally , we pose a question , how the diagram would change if @xmath112 and/or @xmath117 were different to the ones used so far .",
    "answers to the above questions should be sought by means of analytical calculations .",
    "in the weak - field approximation the cf is treated as a perturbation with respect to the intra - atomic coulomb interaction , whose eigenstates are spectral terms with certain @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "since the cf acts on spatial but not on spin variables , terms with different @xmath119 do not mix together ( as long as the spin - orbit coupling is neglected ) . in the @xmath120 configuration",
    "there is a single quintet term , @xmath121 , whose coulomb energy is@xcite",
    "@xmath122    the remaining task consists in diagonalizing the cf hamiltonian ( [ hcf ] ) on the wave functions of @xmath121 , since there are no other terms with @xmath24 . to this end , it is convenient to interpret eq .",
    "( [ hcf ] ) in a slightly different way than it was done in section iii .",
    "namely , @xmath51 are now regarded as stevens operators in the @xmath118 representation ( @xmath123 ) : @xmath124 etc .",
    "since @xmath121 contains a single @xmath59 electron above a closed semi - shell , it is only this one electron that is exposed to the cf .",
    "therefore , @xmath125 and the coefficients @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ hcf ] ) are the same in both representations .",
    "so we can simply take over the one - electron cf energies ( [ d_energies ] ) . in doing so",
    ", we capitalize the irrep labels , to indicate that they now refer to many - electron states , and append the multiplicity 5 .",
    "we also prefix @xmath126 ( [ coulomb5d ] ) .",
    "the resulting energies of the quintet states are as follows : @xmath127      in the strong - cf approximation the zeroth - order states are constructed from one - electron eigenstates of the cf hamiltonian ( [ hcf ] ) , then their energies are corrected for the coulomb repulsion . a first question that arises is : which six one - electron @xmath59 states are filled in a cf of symmetry @xmath10 ? to give a possibly general answer , it is convenient to express all relevant energies in the units of @xmath94 . thus , the one - electron cf energies ( [ d_energies ] ) are divided by @xmath94 .",
    "then , equating pairs of the so modified expressions , one obtains 5 equations linear in @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "the corresponding lines in the parameter plane @xmath130 ( figure [ fig2 ] ) are loci of points where the sequence of cf levels changes . for example , the levels @xmath131 and @xmath132 cross over on a line decribed by @xmath133 as readily obtained by equating the last two eqs .",
    "( [ d_energies ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ example ] ) describes the upper one of the two parallel lines in figure [ fig2 ] ; the lower line arises from the condition @xmath134 .",
    "likewise , the equation @xmath135 generates a pair of parallel lines with a negative slope .",
    "a single line passing through the origin is produced by the relation @xmath136 .",
    "finally , the equation @xmath137 leads to no line ; this is why there are 5 solid lines in figure [ fig2 ] , rather than 6 as expected combinatorially .",
    "the cf levels @xmath132 and @xmath138 do not swap at any inner point of figure [ fig2 ] , but do so at infinity , where @xmath94 changes sign .",
    "therefore , @xmath139 ( a short for @xmath138 ) stands always to the left of @xmath140 ( @xmath132 ) in the level sequences indicated within each one of the 12 domains .",
    "the sequence labels , read from left to right , name the cf levels in order of ascending energy if @xmath141 , and in order of descending energy if @xmath142 .",
    "partition of the @xmath143 plane among all possible permutations of the four one - electron cf levels .",
    ", scaledwidth=47.0% ]    up to this point no restrictions have been placed on the cf , apart from those imposed by the @xmath10 symmetry .",
    "now we do restrict the cf by demanding that it must additionally comply with the superposition model , eq .",
    "( [ superpos ] ) .",
    "this implies that the system is now bound to the horizontal dashed line in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the dashed line cuts through six domains .",
    "the corresponding intervals on the abscissa axis are numbered 1 to 6 in order of ascending @xmath128 , with @xmath141 .",
    "thus , the interval # 1 stands for @xmath144 , # 2 means that @xmath145 etc . the same intervals , but with @xmath142 , will be referred to by overscore numbers @xmath146 to @xmath147 .",
    "now , examining the cf level sequences in the above 12 intervals , one encounters only 3 situations where there is a cf gap between the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied orbitals .",
    "the corresponding ground - state electronic configurations are as follows : @xmath148    within the above intervals of @xmath128 the ground state is a singlet , provided that the cf is sufficiently strong . in all other cases the fermi level is caught at the partially occupied quadruply degenerate @xmath149 level and there is a possibility of both a singlet and a ( spin ) triplet ground state with the same energy . a subsequent allowance for intra - atomic ( hund s ) exchange",
    "makes the triplet states energetically more favorable than the singlet ones .",
    "therefore , singlets are no viable candidates for ground state in all intervals where triplets with the same cf energy are possible . in such intervals only the triplets will be considered ( in the next subsection ) .",
    "conversely , in the three cases where there are viable singlet states ( [ intervals ] ) , competing triplet states will be taken into consideration as well , constructed from excited cf configurations .",
    "such triplets still have a chance of becoming ground state on account of hund s exchange in situations where the cf is not strong enough , near interval boundaries , etc .",
    "let us now turn to our direct task  computing the energies of the singlet states ( [ intervals ] ) .",
    "the cf energies are computed most readily , by summing up the energies of the six occupied one - electron states as given by eqs .",

    "first - order correlation corrections are then computed following slater s",
