    "nanoscopic systems have attracted significant attention from the scientific community due to the possibility of designing ever - smaller electronic devices . amongst candidates with greatest potential for application",
    "one can find carbon - based materials such as carbon nanotubes ( cnt)@xcite , and more recently graphene@xcite .",
    "intrinsic defects are often seen as the source of deleterious effects in semiconductor materials@xcite .",
    "for instance , vacancies and clusters of vacancies have important well known effects on the properties of many semiconductors of technological importance such as @xmath0@xcite , @xmath1@xcite , @xmath2@xcite and @xmath3@xcite .",
    "the same , however , can not be clearly stated about carbon based materials . in fact , defects in carbon nanotubes can be used as binding sites for different types of gaseous species in cnt - based sensors@xcite , as well as in a new family of disordered graphene spintronics devices@xcite .",
    "one point is clear : defects can lead to drastic changes in the electronic structure of carbon - based systems .",
    "thus if these materials are to be the building blocks of tomorrow s electronics , characterizing these defects is of utmost importance .    in carbon nanotubes",
    "one can find many different types of defects ranging from stone - wales@xcite , to adatoms@xcite and vacancies@xcite .",
    "recently , saito _",
    "et al._@xcite have reported on the existence of point defects in graphene , ranging from a single vacancy to an octovacancy@xcite .",
    "the authors also show that the divacancy , the tetravacancy , and the hexavacancy , are the most stable defects in a graphene sheet .    in order to highlight the stability of specific vacancies",
    "one introduces the concept of magic numbers@xcite .",
    "these magic numbers indicate the size - the number of atoms removed - of a defect that lead to the most stable multivacancies .",
    "previous studies using positron annihilation in graphite suggest that the hexavacancy , @xmath4 , was the most stable defect@xcite .",
    "this stability was explained by the dangling bond counting model ( dbcm ) , where the number of dangling bonds ( db ) of the system , @xmath5 , decreased as the vacancy became more stable .",
    "this model was also successful in explaining the stability of multivacancies in silicon@xcite and gaas@xcite .",
    "in graphene , however , saito _ et al._@xcite , noted that the stability of the defect also depends on pentagons formed upon reconstruction of the system . subsequently extending the dangling bond counting model - adding to that the effect of the pentagons - the authors proposed the pentagon and dangling bond counting model ( pdbcm ) .",
    "the pdbcm is based on the average energy per db and per pentagon in all defects considered .",
    "the model was then used in explaining the stability of vacancies ( and consequently the existence of magic numbers ) in graphene .",
    "the aim of the present study is twofold .",
    "the first one is to determine what are the most stable vacancies in carbon nanotubes and whether the pdbcm is applicable in the presence of hybridization between @xmath6 orbitals due to curvature effects .",
    "secondly and most importantly we propose a modified model based on the pdbcm that uses only two defects for the construction of the model .",
    "in other words , one does not need to perform calculations for all vacancies to determine the parameters for the model ; all the parameters - as we will show - can be obtained by two preliminary calculations .",
    "most importantly , as it will be demonstrated , it contains all the physical ingredients to predict the existence of magic numbers in carbon nanotubes , even in the case of large curvature effects .",
    "_ ab initio _ total energy calculations based on density functional theory@xcite were performed for different types of vacancies on @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 carbon nanotubes .",
    "this smaller - radius nanotubes was chosen in order to give rise to large curvature effects , as oposed to the planar graphene sheet.we used the generalized gradient approximation ( gga)@xcite for the exchange and correlation potential within the perdew - burke - ernzerhof approach @xcite .",
    "our simulations were performed using a plane - wave dft method within the vasp code@xcite and with ultrasoft pseudopotentials.@xcite in all our calculations a plane wave energy cutoff of @xmath11 and @xmath12 k - points along the reciprocal axis of the cnt were used .    initially the defects are created by simply removing @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) carbon atoms from a pristine structure containing @xmath12 irreducible unit cells for each nanotube@xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 nanotubes with different numbers of carbon atoms removed prior to relaxation are shown in figure [ multirelax]@xmath15 - left hand - side panel ( the defects on the other nanotubes are equal )",
    ". hereafter we label @xmath16 the respective vacancy where @xmath13 carbon atoms have been removed .",
    "we note that the creation of vacancies leads to the formation of dangling bonds - carbon atoms with two - fold coordination instead of the expected three - fold one - which are energetically unfavorable .",
    "the systems are allowed to atomically rearrange using a conjugate gradient method ( cg ) until the forces on all the atoms are lower than @xmath17 .",
    "the final relaxed structures are shown in figure [ multirelax]@xmath18 - right hand - side panel .",
    "one can notice that the defects undergo a reconstruction that leads to the formation of pentagons and subsequent saturation of the dangling bonds .",
    "we note that in the case of @xmath13 even , the number of dbs goes to zero ( except for @xmath19 ) .",
    "the formation energy , @xmath20 $ ] for the @xmath21 vacancy is calculated using , @xmath22=e_{r}[n]-e_{p}\\left[n\\right]-n\\mu_{c } ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the total energy of the pristine nanotube , @xmath24 $ ] is the total energy of the reconstructed nanotube with a @xmath21 defect , @xmath13 is the number of carbon atoms removed from the system and @xmath25 is the chemical potential of @xmath26 carbon atom , which is the total energy of the pristine nanotube divided by the number of atoms on the sysmtem .     +    the total formation energy as a function of vacancy size is shown in figure [ form_energy_defects]@xmath27 . from the figure ,",
    "one might be tempted to say that the @xmath28 is the most stable vacancy . however , a more reasonable approach is to compare each vacancy normalizing the number of atoms that have been removed from the system@xcite . in that case",
    "we observe from figure [ form_energy_defects]@xmath29 that the hexavacancy has the lowest formation energy per @xmath30 atom removed .",
    "we also note that @xmath31 $ ] is nonmonotonic .",
    "instead , it has local minima for even @xmath13 .",
    "this result is in line with previous results for graphene indicating the existence of the so - called magic numbers , namely @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 for carbon nanotubes as well as graphene .    that , however , is not the full picture .",
    "one step further into fully understanding the stability of vacancies in cnts is to determine how they are correlated with closely sized vacancies , for instance , whether a @xmath4 will break into a single vancancy , @xmath35 , and a pentavacany , @xmath36 , and so on .",
    "hence , in order to address defect stability saito _",
    "et al._@xcite proposed two quantities associated with distinct dissociation processes .",
    "the first one assumes that a @xmath37 defect breaks up into a single vacancy , @xmath35 , and a @xmath38 vacancy ,    @xmath39    in that manner the first dissociation energy is defined as the energy change between initial and final states ,    @xmath40=e_{f}\\left[n-1\\right]+e_{f}\\left[1\\right]-e_{f}\\left[n\\right ] ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for the second case , one would have two @xmath37 defects that reconstruct into a @xmath38 and a @xmath41 vacancy . in other words , a single vacancy breaks away from one of the defects and migrates to another one close by    @xmath42    thus the second dissociation energy considered here is defined as    @xmath43=e_{f}\\left[n+1\\right]+e_{f}\\left[n-1\\right]-2e_{f}\\left[n\\right ] ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we finish by highlighting that , following the above definition , the higher the value of @xmath44 $ ] and @xmath45 $ ] , the more stable the defect is .    ,",
    "@xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 carbon nanotubes.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ] +    in figure [ diss_ener]@xmath46 we observe peaks in the dissociation energy , localized in @xmath28 , @xmath47 and @xmath4 . following the same idea given by saito _",
    "et al._@xcite , we can conclude that the vacancies @xmath28 , @xmath47 and @xmath4 are stable in the carbon nanotubes in a fashion similar to graphene , corroborating the initial conclusion that there are three magic numbers .",
    "furthermore , the curvature for such nanotubes is quite large , therefore we can also conclude that these magic numbers are valid for graphene and nanotubes in general .    in order to understand the origin of the stability for these particular defects we will focus on the nanotube that has the largest curvature effect - the @xmath7 .",
    "first we will look to a model that only takes into account the dangling bonds , namely the dangling bond counting model @xmath48@xcite .",
    "we therefore need to determine some quantities .",
    "the first is the gain in energy due to the relaxation of the system , which is defined as the difference in energy between the reconstructed system and the energy of the system with the unrelaxed defect , @xmath49 ,    @xmath50=e_u\\left[n\\right]-e_r\\left[n\\right]~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the pentagon bond energy is then defined as the ratio between the relaxation energy and the number of pentagons , @xmath51 , in the relaxed cnt    @xmath52 = e_{relax}\\left[n\\right]/n_{pent } ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    finally we also define the energy per dangling bond as the ratio between the formation energy of the unrelaxed defect and the number of dangling bonds    @xmath53=\\left(e_u - e_p\\left[n\\right ] - n \\mu_c \\right)/n_{db } ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in table [ tab_ener ] we summarize these quantities for each one of the vacancies in the present study obtained from our dft calculations .",
    "cccccccccc & @xmath35 & @xmath28 & @xmath54 & @xmath47 & @xmath36 & @xmath4 & @xmath55 & @xmath19 & @xmath56 +   + @xmath57 @xmath58 & @xmath59 & @xmath60 & @xmath61 & @xmath62 & @xmath63 & @xmath64 & @xmath65 & @xmath61 & - + @xmath66 @xmath58 & @xmath67 & @xmath68 & @xmath69 & @xmath70 & @xmath71 & @xmath72 & @xmath65 & @xmath69 & @xmath73 + @xmath74 @xmath58 & @xmath75 & @xmath70 & @xmath73 & @xmath71 & @xmath76 & @xmath77 & @xmath78 & @xmath79 & @xmath80 + @xmath81 @xmath58 & @xmath26 & @xmath32 & @xmath32 & @xmath82 & @xmath82 & @xmath33 & @xmath26 & @xmath32 & - + @xmath5 & @xmath82 & @xmath33 & @xmath83 & @xmath34 & @xmath84 & @xmath12 & @xmath84 & @xmath12 & - + @xmath85 & @xmath26 & @xmath86 & @xmath26 & @xmath86 & @xmath26 & @xmath86 & @xmath32 & @xmath86 & - + @xmath87 & @xmath88 & @xmath12 & @xmath89 & @xmath88 & @xmath90 & @xmath89 & @xmath91 & @xmath92 & - +    the first model we analyze only takes into consideration the dangling bonds in the system .",
    "thus the formation energy in the so called dangling bond counting model is simply given by @xmath93=2.49n_{db}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the number of dangling bonds for the unreconstructed system and the proportionality factor corresponds to the energy per db , averaged over all possible vacancies as shown in table [ tab_ener ] .",
    "the dbcm is a rather simplified model and it does not take into account the strong relaxation of the defects . on the other hand the pentagon and dangling bond counting model proposed by saito _",
    "et al . _ also considers the reconstruction of the vacancies into pentagons . in the pdbcm",
    "the formation energy is thus obtained by considering also the reconstruction of the vacancies into pentagons .",
    "hence the pentagon and dangling bond counting model adds a correction to the dbcm to include the gain in energy due to the formation of pentagons .",
    "this new term includes the number of pentagons and the average pentagon bond energy .",
    "thus the formation energy in the pdbcm is written as @xmath94=2.49n_{db}-2.50n_{pent}\\ ] ] where @xmath95 is the number of pentagons of the relaxed system .",
    "we note that the formation energy is now given by a competition between the high - energy dangling bonds and the reconstruction of the defects into pentagons to try to eliminate as many dbs as possible .    in figure [ form_all_models ]",
    "we present the formation energy calculated with both methods , dbcm and pdbcm , compared with our dft results assumed here to be a benchmark calculation .",
    "( black square ) are used as a benchmark for the quality of both models , title=\"fig:\",width=321 ] +    from figure [ form_all_models ] we can extract two pieces of information .",
    "first , if we consider only the dangling bonds , we obtain a linear relationship over a wide range of defects .",
    "that is clearly not the profile seen by performing the full dft calculation .",
    "it is then clear that the reconstruction plays an important role in the formation energy of the defect . using the pdbcm , where not only the dangling bonds are taken into consideration but also the number of pentagons formed after relaxation",
    ", we can see that the results are in reasonable agreement with our dft calculations .",
    "$ ] ( equation ( [ eqdiss_en01 ] ) ) , and b ) @xmath45 $ ] ( equation ( [ eqdiss_en02 ] ) ) for the dangling bond couting model and the pentagon and dangling bond counting model .",
    "we also present our dft results for comparsion.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ] +    we also use both models to fit the dissociation energies and to determine whether they reproduce the magic numbers that have been found in our dft calculations . from figure [ diss_ener_models ] - which shows the dissociation energies as a function of defect size",
    "- we can conclude again , that the dangling bond counting model fails to reproduce the two dissociation energies , whereas the model that takes into account the pentagons , reproduces reasonably well ( specially in the case of @xmath96 ) our dft calculations .",
    "thus , the pdbcm as proposed by saito _",
    "_ , can be used to explain the appearance of the magic numbers and the stability of the vacancies .",
    "the model presented here uses averages over all defects , but even if one uses only two defects - the single vacancy and the @xmath28 - would lead to a similar result .",
    "one downside of the pdbcm , however , is the fact that it can not account for the dips in the formation energy for even - numbered vacancies . by construction ,",
    "the formation energies of these vacancies are always identical to the previous odd - numbered ones .",
    "thus , @xmath31 $ ] , it is not possible to infer the existence of the magic numbers .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that the model is missing an important ingredient . in the light of this problem",
    "we propose a new model for the formation energy of multivacancies .",
    "this model retains the spirit of the pdbcm where dbs and the reconstruction of the defect are the main ingredients for the formation energy , but it should also include information about the final shape of the defect . in others words , energy is gained by forming the pentagons , but in detriment of other bonds that are bent after the relaxation is complete .",
    "our proposal for the formation energy is based on three main contributions .",
    "the first includes the contribution due to the dangling bonds while the second accounts for the formation of pentagons after relaxation .",
    "both of which retain the same spirit of the pdbcm , @xmath97=e_{db}n_{db}-e_{p}n_{p}+e_{s}(n_{s}-n_{p}).\\ ] ] the third and final term accounts for the relaxation energy @xmath98 of all bonds in the defect which have not been included in the pentagons .    in order to determine the parameters described above",
    ", we choose the single vacancy and the trivacancy @xcite . since both show , upon relaxation , pantagons and dangling bonds .",
    "the dangling bond energy is obtained by taking the average between two defects .",
    "we then use the dft results for @xmath35 and @xmath54 in equation ( [ eq_ourmodel ] ) together with the average dangling bond energy .",
    "this leads to a system of simultaneous equations if one assumes the dft result to be the correct formation energy in this case .",
    "the parameters are thus summarized in table [ tab_enermodel ] .    .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the formation energies for all defects , calculated from equation ( [ eq_ourmodel ] ) are depicted in figure [ former_modelos ] .",
    "one can see that the mpdbcm is , in general , better than the pdbcm .",
    "in particular it is capable of accounting for the dips on the formation energy of even - numbered multivacancies .",
    "the only case where the mpdbcm performs worse is the tetravacancy . for the @xmath47 ,",
    "the pentagon oriented along the tube has much longer bond lenghts when compared to the @xmath99 bonds ( @xmath100 as oposed to @xmath101 ) .",
    "this leads to a discrepancy in the formation energy that coincidentally is correct in the pdbcm .",
    "+    the dissociation energies calculated with the mpdbcm ( shown in figure [ diss_en_ze ] ) are also in very good agreement when compared with our dft calculations .",
    "again they are usually better .    $ ] and b ) @xmath45 $ ] , title=\"fig:\",width=321 ] +",
    "hence we have calculated the formation and dissociation energies associated with @xmath13-vacancies in carbon nanotubes .",
    "we have demostrated that in carbon nanotubes with large curvature effects as in graphene the same stable multivacancies appear , namely the divacancy , the tetravacancy and the hexavacancy .",
    "the existance of these magic numbers is corroborated by the pentagon and dangling bond counting model which shows that the stability of the defects is given by the competition between high energy dangling bonds and the reconstruction of the multivacancies . in the cases where the defects are most stable we note that the relaxation leads to no dangling bonds left .",
    "finally we proposed a modified method based on the pdbcm which also takes into account the final shape of the system .",
    "it takes into consideration both dangling bonds and the reconstruction of the defect and adds to that effect of bond streching and bond bending that takes place of reconstruction .",
    "this way we are able to include one important physical ingredient that was missing from previous models . from our calculations one can obtain the parameters that fit extremely well the formation and dissociation energies of a number of @xmath13-vacancies .",
    "in particular , our model is capable of accounting for magic numbers 2,4 and 6 which are related to the most stable defects .                                                                              in cnts ,",
    "as opposed to graphene , there is sometimes more than one non - equivalent way of making an @xmath13-vacancy due to curvature effects . in this work",
    "we only consider , for each @xmath13 vacancy , the arrangement with the lowest formation energy ."
