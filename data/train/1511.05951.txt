    "since the advent of gauge theory , many new construction techniques , such as rational blowdowns , generalized fiber sum , knot surgery and luttinger surgery , have been introduced and successfully employed to produce symplectic @xmath5-manifolds homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to rational surfaces @xmath1 , for @xmath8 .",

    "the main goal of this article is to introduce novel ways of constructing _ small _ positive factorizations ( as in _ small _ number of positive dehn twists ) of the boundary multi - twist in the mapping class group @xmath9 of a compact genus-@xmath7 surface with @xmath10 boundary components , which correspond to monodromy factorizations of genus-@xmath7 lefschetz pencils on small symplectic @xmath5-manifolds .",
    "a first application yields the first explicit examples of pencils on exotic rational surfaces :    [ main1 ] there are symplectic genus-@xmath0 lefschetz pencils @xmath11 ) whose total spaces are homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "they realize the smallest possible genera pencils in these homeomorphism classes .",
    "a key result leading to theorem  [ main1 ] is that @xmath14 , for @xmath15 , does not admit a genus @xmath16 lefschetz fibration or a genus-@xmath7 lefschetz pencil with @xmath17 base points ( lemma  [ notrational ] ) , which provides a new criterion to argue that the total spaces of such pencils / fibrations like the ones in theorem  [ main1 ] are exotic .",
    "we moreover observe that @xmath18 is the smallest possible genus for a lefschetz pencil on these exotic @xmath5-manifolds ( remark  [ smallest ] ) .",

    "all torus bundles over tori have _ solvmanifold fundamental groups _",
    "@xcite , and notably , it was shown by stefan friedl and stefano vidussi that the _ homeomorphism type _ of a symplectic calabi - yau surface with a solvmanifold fundamental group is uniquely determined @xcite . as stated by tian - jun li @xcite ,",
    "what seems to commonly provide a posteriori reasoning for a positive answer to the question  [ scyclassification ] is the lack of any new constructions of symplectic @xmath5-manifolds of kodaira dimension zero .",
    "surgical operations widely used to construct most interesting symplectic @xmath5-manifolds in the past , such as luttinger surgery , generalized fiber sums , knot surgery , or simplest rational blow - down operations , do not produce any new scys @xcite .",
    "we will present a new construction of symplectic calabi - yau surfaces with _ via lefschetz pencils _ , where the genus of the pencil @xmath26 versus @xmath43 , building on the work of cliff taubes , will determine the kodaira dimension of @xmath44 ( lemma  [ scypencil ] ; also @xcite ) .",

    "we inbreed the monodromy factorizations of matsumoto s well - known genus-@xmath54 lefschetz fibration @xcite , and using further lifts of it obtained by noriyuki hamada @xcite , we can even derive an explicit lift of @xmath55 , which is a positive factorization of the boundary multi - twist @xmath56 in @xmath57 . letting @xmath58",
    "denote the corresponding symplectic genus-@xmath0 lefschetz pencil , we obtain ( theorem  [ scyfamily ] ) :    [ main3 ] positive factorizations @xmath55 prescribe symplectic genus-@xmath0 lefschetz pencils on a family of symplectic calabi - yau surfaces @xmath59 in all rational homology classes of torus bundles over tori .",
    "this provides a first step towards analyzing the monodromies of pencils on a rich family of scys , as proposed by simon donaldson in @xcite[problem  5 ] .",

    "torus bundles over tori _ with sections",
    "_ do admit symplectic genus-@xmath0 pencils @xcite ; however the uncanny freedom we have in the choice of @xmath60 appears to exceed that of a torus bundle with a section ( see the discussion in remark  [ comparesmith ] ) .",
    "the explicit nature of our construction allows us to derive explicit presentations for @xmath61 , which for instance yields an @xmath44 ( when @xmath60 is trivial ) that is at least homeomorphic to the @xmath5-torus .",
    "we will discuss this example in complete detail in section  [ sec:4torus ] .",
    "it is not clear to us at this point whether or not _ all _ @xmath61 are @xmath5-dimensional solvmanifold groups ( some of them certainly are ) , which we hope to understand in future work .    on the other hand",
    ", we observe that _ all _ @xmath59 are obtained from @xmath44 , our scy homeomorphic to the @xmath5-torus , via _ fibered _ luttinger surgeries along lagrangian tori or klein bottles ( remark  [ compareholi ] ) .",
    "so if our family of @xmath59 is equal to the family of torus bundles over tori , it immediately confirms an improved version of an interesting conjecture by tian - jun li and chung - i ho @xcite[conjecture  4.9 ] : _ any smooth oriented torus bundle @xmath44 possesses a symplectic structure @xmath62 such that @xmath35 can be obtained by applying luttinger surgeries to @xmath63 _ ( remark  [ compareholi ] ) .",
    "finally , theorem  [ main3 ] implies that we have symplectic genus-@xmath0 pencils @xmath64 with @xmath65 for any @xmath66 .",
    "this yields further ( infinitely many ) examples of non - holomorphic genus-@xmath0 pencils , in the same fashion as in our earlier examples in theorem  [ main2 ] .    the techniques we employed to produce the genus-@xmath0 pencils in theorems  [ main1 ] , and  [ main3 ] can be easily adapted to produce higher genera pencils on similar @xmath5-manifolds ; we can in fact derive many of these by repeatedly breeding / inbreeding the same collection of positive factorizations used in this paper .",
    "this direction will be explored elsewhere .",
    "we will however discuss one immediate generalization of our construction of a genus-@xmath0 pencil to higher genera .",
    "it will allow us to address a problem raised by mustafa korkmaz @xcite[problem  2.7 ] , which we re - express here for pencils ( which are even more constrained than fibrations ) :    is @xmath67 for any non - trivial genus-@xmath7 lefschetz pencil @xmath26 ? is there an upper bound on @xmath68 linear in @xmath7 , and sharper than @xmath69 ?    in section  [ sec : bound ] , generalizing our construction of a genus-@xmath0 pencil on @xmath44 homeomorphic to the @xmath5-torus , we will produce genus-@xmath7 lefschetz pencils violating the above bound for every odd @xmath70 . though not much ; we will indeed revamp korkmaz s question by raising the upper bound to @xmath71 ( question  [ b1refinedquestion ] ) .    _ acknowledgements .",

    "lefschetz fibration _ is defined similarly for @xmath81 .",
    "blowing - up all the base points @xmath75 in a pencil @xmath26 , one obtains a lefschetz fibration @xmath82 with disjoint @xmath83-sphere sections @xmath84 corresponding to @xmath75 , and vice versa .",
    "we say @xmath26 is a _",
    "genus @xmath7 lefschetz pencil _ or _ fibration _ for @xmath7 the genus of a _ regular fiber _",
    "@xmath85 of @xmath78 .",
    "the fiber containing the critical point @xmath76 has a nodal singularity at @xmath76 , which locally arises from shrinking a simple loop @xmath86 on @xmath85 , called the _ vanishing cycle_. a singular fiber of @xmath26 is called _ reducible _ if @xmath86 is separating . when @xmath86 is null - homotopic on @xmath85 , one of the fiber components becomes an _ exceptional sphere _ , an embedded @xmath54-sphere of self - intersection @xmath87 , which we can blow down without changing the rest of the fibration .",
    "in this paper we use the term lefschetz fibration only when the set of critical points @xmath88 is non - empty , i.e. when the lefschetz fibration is _ non - trivial_. we moreover assume that the fibration is _ relatively minimal _ , i.e. it there are no exceptional spheres contained in the fibers , and also that the points @xmath76 lie in distinct _ singular fibers _ , which can be always achieved after a small perturbation .",
    "a widely used way of constructing lefschetz fibrations is the _ fiber sum _ operation : if @xmath27 are genus-@xmath7 lefschetz fibrations with regular fiber @xmath89 for @xmath90 , then their _ fiber sum _ is a genus-@xmath7 lefschetz fibration @xmath26 , where @xmath44 is obtained by removing a fibered tubular neighborhood of each @xmath89 from @xmath91 and then identifying the resulting boundaries via a fiber - preserving , orientation - reversing self - diffeomorphism , and where @xmath78 restricts to @xmath92 on each @xmath93 .",

    "here we construct explicit positive factorizations for symplectic genus-@xmath0 lefschetz pencils , whose total spaces are homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to the complex rational surfaces .      in @xcite , we have obtained the following relation in @xmath135 @xmath136 which can be rewritten as @xmath137 where @xmath138 .",

    "_ lift _ of the monodromy factorization of matsumoto s well - known genus-@xmath54 lefschetz fibration @xcite .",
    "such a lift to @xmath135 was first found by ozbagci and stipsicz in @xcite and a further lift to @xmath151 by korkmaz in @xcite .",
    "we will however work with another lift discovered by noriyuki hamada , which yields the following relation in @xmath151 @xcite : @xmath152 where @xmath111 are the boundary parallel curves , and the curves @xmath153 and @xmath149 are as shown on the left - hand side of figure  [ matsumoto ] .",
    "we can rewrite this relation in @xmath151 as @xmath154 where each @xmath155 for @xmath156 ( figure  [ matsumoto ] ) .",

    "@xmath161 and @xmath147 all commute with each other .",

    "so @xmath176 is a positive factorization of @xmath177 in @xmath139 .",

    "each one of these three fibrations is obtained by a _ section sum _ of an achiral genus-@xmath54 lefschetz fibration and a trivial torus fibration along a section of self - intersection zero , so by novikov additivity , its signature is equal to that of the achiral genus-@xmath54 fibration .",
    "the hyperelliptic signature formula for genus-@xmath54 fibrations @xcite allows us to easily calculate these as @xmath195 , @xmath195 , and @xmath196 , which add up to give signature @xmath197 for the original genus-@xmath0 achiral lefschetz fibration .",
    "the signature of @xmath188 is the same as the signature of this achiral fibration , since canceling a pair of separating dehn twists with opposite signs amounts to taking out a pair of @xmath198 contribution to the signature .",
    "hence , we get @xmath199 . by identical arguments ,",
    "we get @xmath200 and @xmath201 .",
    "clearly each @xmath91 has an odd intersection form : this can be easily seen from the presence of the reducible fiber component split off by the separating vanishing cycle @xmath149 and not hit by the @xmath83-sphere .",

    "lastly , we will show that @xmath203 , by calculating the latter as the quotient of @xmath204 by the subgroup normally generated by the vanishing cycles of @xmath180 , for each @xmath34 .",
    "it suffices to find enough relations that kill the generators @xmath205 of @xmath204 ( which are as shown in figure  [ pi1generators ] ) , so we do not need to work with the full presentation .",
    "each positive factorization @xmath28 contains the factor @xmath206 .",
