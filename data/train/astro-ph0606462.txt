    "the brightness of grb afterglows for a brief period makes them visible throughout most of the observable universe ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and therefore a sensitive probe of both the interstellar medium ( ism ) of their host galaxies and the intervening gas ( e.g * ? ? ?",

    "the study of metal absorption lines detected in the afterglow spectra illuminates the physical conditions in the ism hosting the grb , such as the column density , the gas metallicity , the dust - to - gas ratio , and the kinematics .",
    "moreover , the access to features belonging to the circumstellar medium of the progenitor star of the grb may yield strong constraints on the progenitor and may help to understand the impact of the grb on the local environment ( e.g.  ramirez - ruiz et al .  2005 ; van marle , langer , & graca - segura 2005 ; prochaska , chen , & bloom 2006 , hereafter pcb06 ) .",
    "interestingly , the transitions from excited states of c@xmath0 , si@xmath0 , and o@xmath6 appear to be a generic feature in grb host environments , while they are observed through only rare sightlines , such as broad absorption - line ( bal ) quasars @xcite , and in gas near stars like @xmath7  carinae and @xmath8  pictoris @xcite .",
    "in addition , a large fraction of the grb hosts also show excited fe@xmath0 lines @xcite .",
    "does the detection of these excited state absorption lines reveal extreme ( pre ) circumburst environments or are they the result of work done by the afterglow in early times after the burst ? to answer this we need to consider competing scenarios for the production of excited - state transitions , and particularly for fe@xmath0 : ( 1 )  collisional excitation and ( 2 )  photon pumping .",
    "pcb06 have recently shown that in the presence of an intensified uv radiation field from the afterglow   known to be stronger than @xmath9 to @xmath10 times the ambient far - uv radiation field in the ism of the milky way   indirect uv pumping alone can produce the excited states observed in grb hosts without imposing extreme gas density and temperature . however , as we will show below , at the distance allowed for fe@xmath0 to survive the intense afterglow uv radiation ( @xmath11 pc ) the excitation rate from the wr star is insufficient to produce the observed excited states .",
    "in addition , the excitation rate due to direct ir pumping by the afterglow is orders of magnitude smaller than the excitation rate due to afterglow uv pumping . ] . under the photon pumping conditions , temporal variation in the absorption - line strength of excited state transitions",
    "is expected , because of the decline in the ionizing flux of the afterglow . @xcite and @xcite predicted time - dependent resonance absorption features in the grb afterglow spectra , such as the doublet , over a timescale of a few days to a few weeks .",
    "their analysis also indicated that important constraints on the extent and gas density of the circumburst medium can be derived .",
    "however , searches for absorption - line variability have so far yielded null results @xcite .    under the photon pumping scenario ,",
    "temporal variation in excited transitions on scales of a few hours is expected , because the decay timescale for the excited states ranges from 8 to 15 minutes .",
    "given the new insights into the origin of excited lines , in this _",
    "letter _ we analyze afterglow spectra of grb020813 obtained in two different epochs of @xmath12 hours apart .",

    "the fe@xmath0 absorption feature is detected in all exposures , and have varied only very marginally over the three hours of the spectroscopic observations .",
    "we measured an upper limit to the rest - frame equivalent width of @xmath42396 in the uves spectrum over the line profile observed in the lris spectrum .",
    "a comparison between the equivalent widths derived from the two - epoch spectra shows that the fe@xmath0 rest - frame equivalent width in epoch  1 of 0.32   differs from the rest - frame equivalent width in epoch  2 at the 4@xmath5 significance level . in other words , at @xmath31% confidence level , the strength of the @xmath42396 line varied between the lris and uves observations . including a conservative estimate of the systematic error associated with continuum placement , the result remains at @xmath32@xmath5 significance level ( see table  [ ew ] ) .",
    "it is , however , necessary to test the robustness of the observed temporal variation in the excited @xmath42396 line , because of the poor signal - to - noise ratio of the uves data and because of the different spectral resolutions between the two data sets .",
    "we therefore performed a monte - carlo analysis .",
    "we first adopted the lris spectrum as the fiducial model spectrum of the afterglow ( given its very high signal - to - noise ratio ) and assumed that the random noise of the uves data is the dominant source of errors .",
    "next , we generated a thousand synthetic spectra through random sampling the lris data within the uves uncertainties .",
    "specifically , for each pixel @xmath33 , the synthetic flux was obtained by drawing a random value within the gaussian error distribution function centered at the fiducial lris flux .",
    "the width of the gaussian distribution function was set by the corresponding 1@xmath5 error of the pixel @xmath33 in the uves spectrum .",
    "we applied the monte - carlo analysis to the rebinned uves spectrum , i.e. , at the same spectral resolution . to test whether or not the excited @xmath42396 ( @xmath3 ) line observed in the lris spectrum could have been visible at the noise level of the uves data , we considered `` the relative position '' defined as the sum of flux differences between two spectra over the pixel range along the @xmath42396 line profile . in fig .",
    "[ monte - carlo ] , we plot the distribution of relative positions between the synthetic spectra and the lris spectrum . we compare it to the observed relative position , @xmath34 , between the uves spectrum and lris spectrum .",
    "we find that @xmath35% of the trials give @xmath36 as a result of random noise .",
    "this indicates that the uves spectrum is statistically different from the lris spectrum and that the @xmath42396 line in the epoch  2 spectrum is significantly weaker than what is detected in epoch  1 spectrum .",
    "the observed difference is at greater than 3@xmath5 level of significance .",
    "the robustness of this result can be checked by considering a `` control '' spectral interval , chosen to be outside the @xmath42396 line profile and containing just the continuum .",
    "the monte - carlo analysis over this control interval shows that @xmath36 lies in the middle of the distribution of relative positions between the synthetic spectra and the lris spectrum ",
    "about 50% of values in the distribution are greater than @xmath36 and about 50% are lower .",

    "significant variation in the strength of the excited feii@xmath42396 feature identified in the grb host is detected at @xmath39@xmath5 level of significance .",
    "a natural consequence of the excited lines being produced by uv pumping is that these excited levels are populated according to the flux of the radiation field .",
    "as the grb afterglow fades , one must witness the decay of the excited states ( pcb06 ) .",
    "our analysis of the afterglow spectra of grb020813 presents the first supporting evidence for the uv pumping model .    for the fe@xmath0 excited levels , the half - life for spontaneous emission is @xmath40 minutes , significantly smaller than the characteristic decay time of the grb afterglow ( fig .",
    "[ lightcurve ] ) .",
    "therefore , the population of the excited states of fe@xmath0 is expected to track the uv flux . at @xmath41 and @xmath42 hours ,",
    "the excitation rates of the @xmath3 level due to indirect uv pumping are @xmath43 s@xmath15 and 5 s@xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the excitation rates are estimated adopting the temporal declining index @xmath44 from @xcite and a spectral index @xmath45 from @xcite .",
    "they are roughly consistent with the measured equivalent width and limit from the two - epoch observations .",
    "following pcb06 , we find that the fe@xmath0 gas must lie beyond 40 pc from the grb afterglow in order to survive the intense ionizing radiation field , but within 100 pc of the grb afterglow such that it will significantly populate the fe@xmath0 levels at @xmath46 hours . in the case of grb020813",
    ", the absence of @xmath42396 at @xmath47 hours further constrains the fe@xmath0 gas at @xmath48 pc from the afterglow .",
    "this is consistent with the presence of mg@xmath6 identified in the host environment @xcite which implies a distance @xmath49 pc ( pcb06 ) .",
    "the results presented here stress the value of obtaining both early and late - time observations of grb afterglows .",
    "while acquiring the observations using the same telescope and instrument is preferred , we demonstrate that precise equivalent width measurements using data from different facilities can also yield strong constraints for the temporal evolution of the excited levels . finally , a time - dependent calculation of radiative transfer and ion excitation may help further reveal the geometry and physical conditions of the gas .",
