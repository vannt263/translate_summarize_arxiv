    "recently , a number of suggestions have been put forward for explaining the observed accelerated expansion of the universe . among them",
    "there are the presence of the cosmological constant , modification of gravity at ultra - large scales , existence of new light fields ( for reviews , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in the latter case",
    ", dark energy can be characterized by equation of state @xmath1 , where the parameter @xmath2 is different from @xmath3 and generically depends on time . in a simple version ,",
    "dark energy is due to a scalar field ( quintessence ) , and the parameter @xmath2 obeys the constraint @xmath4 , while @xmath5 for the cosmological constant .",
    "however , the value of @xmath2 may be strongly negative , @xmath6 ; this is the case for phantom dark energy .",
    "existing data do not exclude also a possibility  @xcite that at relatively large redshift the dark energy is of quintessence type @xmath4 , and later it becomes phantom with @xmath6 .",
    "phantom energy violates null energy condition , which is usually a signal for instabilities . as an example , the simplest model of scalar field with the wrong sign of kinetic term  @xcite suffers from the presence of ghost ( negative energy state ) at arbitrarily high spatial momenta .",
    "this implies catastrophic vacuum instability .",
    "however , in phantom models that break lorentz - invariance , violation of the null energy condition at cosmological scales ( related to the property that @xmath6 for spatially homogeneous phantom field ) does not necessarily imply unacceptable instabilities at shorter scales .",
    "this suggests that lorentz - violating phantom theories may be viable .",
    "indeed , models of this sort have been recently constructed  @xcite .",
    "a property of one class of these models  @xcite is that there is a tachyonic mode in the perturbation spectrum about the homogeneous phantom background .",
    "this mode occurs at sufficiently small spatial momenta only , so that the time scale of the tachyonic instability may be roughly comparable to the age of the universe .",
    "this is not particularly dangerous .",
    "it is conceivable that the existence of tachyonic modes at low spatial momenta is a fairly generic property of a class of phantom models : the violation of the null energy condition may show up precisely in this way .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to study observable consequences of such models . in this paper",
    "we consider one of these consequences , namely , the effect of tachyonic modes on the anisotropy of cmb temperature .",
    "we adopt the phenomenological approach , and instead of using results obtained within a concrete model , we parametrize the tachyonic instability by a few parameters .",
    "we will consider models with a lorentz - violating dispersion relation and lorentz - invariant one .    in the lorentz - violating case , we parametrize the dispersion relation as follows : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are constant parameters , and",
    "@xmath10 is the physical spatial momentum .",
    "our convention is that positive values of @xmath11 correspond to exponential growth of perturbations , while the usual oscillatory behaviour occurs at negative @xmath11 .",
    "thus , the parameter @xmath9 equals to the momentum below which the mode is tachyonic . for given @xmath8 ,",
    "the parameter @xmath9 determines also the time scale of instability .",
    "the parametrization ( [ dispers ] ) is chosen in accord with refs .",
    "@xcite where similar dispersion relation has been found in a concrete model of phantom energy .",
    "the analysis presented below can be straightforwardly generalized to other forms of dispersion relation .    in the lorentz - invariant case",
    "the dispersion relation has the form @xmath12 in this case too , the tachyon mass @xmath9 equals to the spatial momentum below which the mode is unstable , and @xmath13 is the time scale of instability . from our perspective , the important difference between the dispersion relations ( [ dispers ] ) and ( [ eq / pg3/1:phantach ] ) is that in the latter case the `` frequency '' is nonzero at @xmath14 and monotonously decreases as @xmath15 increases , whereas in the former , the `` frequency '' vanishes as @xmath14 and has a maximum at finite @xmath15 .",
    "this will lead to qualitatively different shapes of the contributions to the cmb anisotropy spectra .",
    "it is worth noting in this regard that the lorentz - invariant model may be viewed as a representative of a class of theories with tachyonic perturbations : analogous results would hold for lorentz - violating models with dispersion relations similar to ( [ eq / pg3/1:phantach ] ) .    in the cosmological context",
    ", the dispersion relations ( [ dispers ] ) and ( [ eq / pg3/1:phantach ] ) are written as follows : @xmath16 respectively , where @xmath17 is the time - independent conformal momentum and @xmath18 is the scale factor . in the expanding universe ,",
    "a mode of given @xmath17 is first normal , and after the physical momentum gets reshifted down to @xmath19 , it becomes unstable .    for @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the present value of the hubble parameter , the tachyonic modes in both models start to grow exponentially at times preceding the present cosmological epoch .",
    "the growth of the tachyonic perturbations gives rise to the growth of the gravitational potential @xmath22 generated by these perturbations  @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the amplitude of primordial fluctuations in the mode with conformal momentum @xmath25 at the time @xmath26 when this mode becomes unstable .",
    "we will discuss the range of the amplitudes @xmath27 later on .",
    "we stress that the gravitational potential ( [ gravpot ] ) is generated by tachyonic perturbations rather than inhomogeneities in the ordinary matter .    in this paper",
    "we calculate cmb multipoles generated by the gravitational potential ( [ gravpot ] ) . in the lorentz - violating case , the mechanism we discuss gives rise to the contribution to the cmb anisotropy spectrum which is quite different from the standard spectrum coming from adiabatic scalar perturbations generated , e.g. , at inflationary stage ( for the latter see , e.g. , refs .",
    "as we will see below , the tachyonic contribution leads to potentially observable features in the cmb spectrum at relatively low multipoles . on the other hand , there are hints towards the existence of deviations in the observed spectrum  @xcite from the predictions based on flat ( harrison - zeldovich ) or almost flat spectrum of primordial adiabatic perturbations .",
    "so , one is tempted to employ tachyonic instabilities to explain these deviations .",
    "we add the contribution due to the tachyonic perturbations to the standard contribution of the adiabatic modes and compare the result with the observed spectrum .",
    "we show that the tachyonic contributions slightly improve the agreement between the theory and data , but this improvement is statistically insignificant .",
    "so , our analysis only leads to limits on the parameters of the tachyonic perturbations .    in the lorentz - invariant case ,",
    "tachyonic perturbations contribute to the lowest multipoles only .",
    "an interesting possibility here is that they may generate the entire observed dipole without getting in conflict with measurements of higher multipoles .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin with preliminaries on the cosmological model in section  [ sec : background ] , and then discuss in detail the growth of the gravitational potential due to the tachyonic modes in section  [ sec : growth ] , first in the lorentz - violating model and then in the lorentz - invariant one . in section  [ sec : multipoles ] we calculate the contributions to the cmb multipoles , again distinguishing lorentz - violating and lorentz - invariant cases .",
    "we compare our results with the data in section  [ sec : data ] , and conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the background space - time we consider in this paper corresponds to the `` almost '' standard cosmological model with the only special feature being that the accelerated expansion of the universe is driven by phantom energy instead of the cosmological constant .",
    "the background metric is that of the spatially flat expanding universe , @xmath28 the scale factor @xmath18 is determined by the friedmann equation , which can be written as follows : @xmath29 , \\label{fried1}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the present value of the hubble parameter , @xmath30 is the present value of the scale factor , the dot denotes the derivative with respect to cosmic time @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 refer to phantom energy .",
    "we assume for simplicity that @xmath34 is independent of time ; we will see in what follows that the effects we discuss are largely independent of @xmath33 , so this assumption is not restrictive .",
    "the values we use in this paper are @xmath35 , @xmath36 . according to observational data  @xcite the parameter @xmath33 belongs to the interval @xmath37 .",
    "when calculating the cmb multipoles , we work with conformal time @xmath38 instead of cosmic time @xmath31 , @xmath39 equation ( [ fried1 ] ) , written in terms of conformal time , has the form @xmath40",
    "the gravitational potential of a mode in the tachyonic regime is given by eq .",
    "( [ gravpot ] ) .",
    "the exponent @xmath41 determines the growth of the potential in both lorentz - violating model ( [ dispers ] ) and lorentz - invariant one ( [ eq / pg3/1:phantach ] ) .",
    "properties of this function are different in the two cases , however .      in the lorentz - violating model",
    ", the function ( [ eq / pg5/1:phantach ] ) can be written as an integral over the scale factor , @xmath42 where we have introduced dimensionless wave number @xmath43 a few comments are in order .",
    "first , for a given mode the tachyonic regime begins when the integrand in ( [ fold ] ) becomes real , i.e. , at @xmath44 .",
    "since @xmath45 , the maximum value of @xmath46 for tachyonic modes is @xmath47 , that corresponds to the modes that are entering the tachyonic regime today . in fact , because of the hubble friction , the exponential growth of the tachyonic mode starts not quite at the time when @xmath48 , namely , it starts at the time @xmath26 when the tachyonic `` frequency '' becomes comparable to the hubble parameter , @xmath49 the lower limit of integration in ( [ fold ] ) is the value of the scale factor at that time , @xmath50 .",
    "second , the integral in ( [ fold ] ) is a dimensionless smooth function of its arguments @xmath51 , both of which do not exceed 1 .",
    "therefore , this integral is not parametrically large or small . on the other hand ,",
    "the amplitude @xmath27 is small ( see below ) , so the effect of the tachyonic instability may be considerable only if @xmath52 is sufficiently large .",
    "this can happen if @xmath53 we assume in what follows that this inequality is indeed valid .",
    "third , the integral in ( [ fold ] ) is saturated near its upper limit , and because of ( [ eq / pg6/1:phantom ] ) this integral is practically insensitive to the lower limit of integration .",
    "therefore , it is an excellent approximation to set @xmath54 , that is , approximate the time @xmath26 by the time at which the dispersion relation becomes tachyonic .",
    "in fact , by solving eq .",
    "( [ eq / pg6/1a : phantom ] ) numerically , we have found that @xmath55 with precision of order @xmath56 in a wide range of values of @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) . by setting @xmath54 in ( [ fold ] )",
    "one finds that the dependence of @xmath59 on the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath60 factors out @xmath61    fourth , the function @xmath62 is obviously a growing function of the scale factor @xmath63 ,     as a function of @xmath46 at the values of the scale factor @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( dashed , dotted and solid lines , respectively ) .",
    "clearly , @xmath67 has a maximum at @xmath68 and grows considerably as the scale factor approaches its present value @xmath69 .",
    "* right * : the growth factor @xmath70 $ ] as a function of the scale factor @xmath63 at @xmath71 .",
    "the function @xmath72 $ ] becomes comparable to its present value only at @xmath73 .",
    "calculations are done for @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "[ fig1 ] ]    as shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "this is especially relevant since the gravitational potential ( [ gravpot ] ) depends on @xmath59 exponentially .",
    "we present in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the dependence of @xmath76 $ ] on the scale factor at @xmath77 ; the plot is given for the values of parameters ( see section [ sub : li - exp ] ) , hence our choice here .",
    "] such that @xmath78 .",
    "it is clear that the major effect of tachyonic modes occurs at late times .",
    "finally , let us discuss the dependence of @xmath62 on the parameter @xmath79 .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the function @xmath80 at @xmath69 for different values of this parameter . clearly , the dependence on @xmath79 is weak ; in what follows we take @xmath81 for definiteness .     at @xmath69 for different values of the equation of state parameter of phantom energy , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( solid , dotted and dashed lines ,",
    "respectively ) . ]",
    "the growth function @xmath62 as a function of @xmath57 has a pronounced maximum at @xmath85 .",
    "the existence of a maximum of @xmath62 is a fairly generic property independent of the particular form of the parametrization ( [ dispers ] ) , provided that @xmath86 vanishes at @xmath14 .",
    "indeed , the tachyonic regime begins at @xmath87 .",
    "this implies , in particular , that @xmath88 vanishes at @xmath47 .",
    "now , under the assumption that @xmath89 one observes that @xmath62 vanishes at @xmath90 as well .",
    "hence , @xmath62 has a maximum at some intermediate @xmath46 . in other words , modes of high conformal momentum",
    "have not entered the tachyonic regime yet . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath91 is small also at low conformal momenta , since the tachyonic regime begins too early for the corresponding modes . at that time the scale factor increases too rapidly",
    "; the function @xmath62 does not have enough time to grow by the epoch when the physical momentum @xmath92 gets close to zero and the growth terminates .",
    "the maximum growth occurs for intermediate momenta .",
    "we note in passing that the situation is different in the lorentz - invariant model ( [ eq / pg3/1:phantach ] ) , since in that case @xmath93 , and the maximum growth takes place at the lowest spatial momenta .    besides the growth function @xmath59 , the gravitational potential ( [ gravpot ] ) is determined by the amplitude @xmath27 at the time the perturbations enter the tachyonic regime .",
    "so , we have to estimate this amplitude at @xmath94 .",
    "we assume that the tachyonic perturbations are generated from vacuum fluctuations .",
    "hence , the amplitude is the gaussian random field with zero expectation value , @xmath95 .",
    "this field is completely determined by its two - point correlation function , which we parametrize as follows : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the primordial perturbations of the phantom field .",
    "let us clarify the form chosen for the overall factor .",
    "we recall that the gravitational potential is generated by the perturbations of the phantom field , which in turn is assumed to cause the accelerated cosmological expansion .",
    "this implies , in particular , that the energy density of the homogeneous phantom field is of the order of the present critical density @xmath98 on the other hand , this energy density can be estimated as @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the mass scale characteristic of the phantom field and @xmath101 estimates the value of this field . by comparing eq .",
    "( [ eq / pg8/1:phantom ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ eq / pg8/2:phantom ] ) we obtain an estimate for this value , @xmath102 let us assume that all dimensionful parameters in the phantom lagrangian are of order of the mass parameter @xmath9 entering the dispersion relation ( [ dispers ] ) , so that @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , @xmath104 now , we make use of the poisson equation for the gravitational potential , @xmath105 and find that at physical momenta of order @xmath9 the gravitational potential is of order @xmath106 this gives rise to the overall factor in ( [ eq / pg7/1:phantomp ] ) .",
    "the dimensionless function @xmath107 in ( [ eq / pg7/1:phantomp ] ) parametrizes possible deviations from the flat spectrum ; it is likely that this function is model dependent .",
    "however , we have seen that the growth factor @xmath76 $ ] is peaked at @xmath108 .",
    "this implies that the integrals over conformal momenta , determining cmb anisotropies , are saturated in a narrow region of @xmath17 .",
    "hence , if @xmath107 is sufficiently smooth , our final results are insensitive to its shape , so we can set @xmath109 where @xmath110 is a constant . this constant may be somewhat different from 1 , as it may contain , e.g. , a power of @xmath111 ; it can not , however , contain extra factors involving the planck mass .",
    "we will see that our final results are determined by the interplay between the large growth factor @xmath112 and small factor @xmath113 in @xmath114 , so a possible deviation of @xmath110 from unity is unimportant in the end .",
    "furthermore , we will see that the shape of the tachyonic contribution to the cmb anisotropy spectrum ( the position of the maximum and width ) is almost independent of @xmath9 ; the parameter @xmath9 , as well as @xmath97 , determine the overall magnitude only .",
    "therefore , the constant @xmath110 can be set equal to 1 by redefinition of the parameter @xmath9 . in view of these observations",
    "we write for the two - point correlator , without loss of generality , @xmath115 it is this expression that will be used in what follows .",
    "note that the amplitude @xmath27 is small , so the linearized treatment of the problem is legitimate even for exponentially growing gravitational potential .",
    "let us now discuss possible range of the amplitudes @xmath97 .",
    "the lowest value is obtained by assuming that the perturbations of the phantom field are in the vacuum state just before the tachyonic regime sets in .",
    "since we are interested in momenta of order @xmath9 at that time , their amplitude is estimated as @xmath116 .",
    "the largest conceivable primordial perturbations are those generated at inflationary epoch : their amplitude is then comparable to the amplitudes of other ( nonconformal ) light fields , @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the hubble parameter some 60 @xmath119-foldings before the end of inflation  @xcite . in view of the observational constraint @xmath120",
    ", we estimate the maximum value of @xmath97 as @xmath121 .",
    "we will see that the interesting range of the parameter @xmath103 is roughly @xmath122 , so the latter amplitude is small compared to the background value ( [ eq / pg13/1:tachyon ] ) of the phantom field .    in what follows we present the results in the two extreme cases ,",
    "@xmath123 and @xmath124 the first case is obtained for vacuum amplitudes of fluctuations @xmath125 before they get tachyonic , and we neglected the relatively mild difference between @xmath9 and @xmath21 .",
    "the second case corresponds to the generation of primordial phantom perturbations at inflation with the maximum possible @xmath118 .",
    "we will see that the fact that these values differ by many orders of magnitude , the properties of the contributions to the cmb spectrum are qualitatively similar in the two cases .      the analysis performed in section  [ sub : lv - growth ]",
    "is straightforwardly repeated in the case of lorentz - invariant dispersion relation ( [ eq / pg3/1:phantach ] ) .",
    "there are two properties , however , that make this case different from the lorentz - violating one .",
    "the first property has to do with the behaviour of the function @xmath126 that enters the growth factor , @xmath127 in the lorentz - invariant case one has @xmath128 unlike in the lorentz - violating model , @xmath129 as a function of @xmath46 monotonously decreases as @xmath46 increases , so the maximum of @xmath129 is at @xmath130 .",
    "it is therefore instructive to find @xmath129 at small @xmath46 . to this end , we write for the integral ( [ eqn / pg10/1:phantach ] ) @xmath131 where @xmath132 the integrals ( [ eqn / pg10/3:phantach ] ) , ( [ eqn / pg10/4:phantach ] ) are convergent , since at large @xmath133 one has @xmath134 furthermore , the latter expression shows that at small @xmath46 the integral ( [ eqn / pg10/4:phantach ] ) is of order @xmath135 . the integral ( [ eqn / pg10/3:phantach ] ) can be written as @xmath136 since @xmath137 , the term with @xmath138 in the integrand can be neglected at small @xmath57 , and then the remaining integral is straightforwardly evaluated .",
    "finally , the integral @xmath139 is readily calculated at is weak . ]",
    "@xmath81 , @xmath140 with all contributions included , we obtain finally that at small @xmath46 @xmath141 note that the expressions ( [ eqn / pg10/1a : phantach ] ) and ( [ eqn / pg11/1:phantach ] ) imply that the tachyonic contribution is non - negligible only for @xmath142 .",
    "this is the analog of the inequality ( [ eq / pg6/1:phantom ] ) .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ eqn / pg11/1:phantach ] ) that unlike in the lorentz - violating case , the growth factor @xmath143 $ ] is peaked at @xmath144 .",
    "this is due to the fact that low - momentum modes are tachyonic already at early times , and their `` frequency '' @xmath145 is not small .",
    "however , the modes of very low spatial momenta @xmath146 contribute to the _ monopole _ cmb harmonic only .",
    "this contribution strongly depends on the primordial spectrum of the tachyonic perturbations , i.e. , on the shape of the function @xmath107 in ( [ eq / pg7/1:phantomp ] ) ; this is the second special property of the lorentz - invariant model .",
    "now , the monopole contribution merely renormalizes the average cmb temperature ; it is not directly measurable and will not be discussed in this paper .",
    "multipoles with @xmath147 are less model - dependent : we will see in section  [ sub : li - multi ] that the integrals over momenta are saturated in a relatively narrow region where @xmath148 is not damped , i.e. , in the region where @xmath149 we assume that @xmath107 does not change much in an interval @xmath150 for momenta belonging to the region ( [ eq / pg11/1:phantach ] ) .",
    "then for calculating the cmb multipoles with @xmath147 , we can still use the spectrum ( [ eq / pg7/1:phantom ] ) .",
    "the above discussion of the primordial amplitude @xmath97 holds in the lorentz - invariant case as well .",
    "so , we will again concentrate on the two extreme cases ( [ a ] ) and ( [ b ] ) .",
    "the contribution to cmb anisotropy we are interested in is generated fairly recently , when the tachyon - induced gravitational potential becomes sizeable .",
    "therefore , the only phenomenon responsible for this contribution is the integrated sachs - wolfe effect .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that in the lorentz - violating model this effect operates at the late cosmological epoch beginning at @xmath151 ( @xmath152 ) .",

    "the integrated sachs - wolfe effect then reads ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the present time , and in view of the above discussion we set the lower limit of integration equal to zero instead of the time of last scattering .",

    "this is a very general situation : the tachyonic contributions to the cmb spectrum in models ( [ a ] ) and ( [ b ] ) at the same value of @xmath60 are virtually indistinguishable if the value of @xmath9 appropriately scaled down by about an order of magnitude .",

    "it is also clear that the dipole and quadrupole components differ by one order of magnitude only .",

    "a few comments are in order .",
    "first , it is seen from ( [ exact1 ] ) that the dependence on @xmath0 and on @xmath9 has factorized . therefore , the position of the maximum @xmath172 and the width of the peak in the spectrum depend on the parameter @xmath60 and do not depend on the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath97 . in particular , for @xmath204",
    "the maximum of the function ( [ eq / pg3/1:appendix ] ) is at @xmath209 the overall magnitude of the spectrum depends on @xmath60 , @xmath9 and @xmath97 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath9 is exponential , since @xmath210 .",
    "this justifies the use of ( [ eq / pg7/1:phantom ] ) for the primordial spectrum of perturbations of the gravitational potential .",
    "second , the exponential dependence of @xmath211 on @xmath0 has the following interpretation .",
    "the problem has the characteristic time scale @xmath212 .",
    "this scale determines the time of the development of the tachyonic instability in a mode with momentum @xmath17 . since the growth function @xmath213 has a maximum , the relevant modes have momenta near @xmath214",
    "therefore , the gravitational potential is small at distances @xmath215 along the light cone emanating from the observer ( the tachyonic instability has not developed yet ) . on the other hand , at distances",
    "@xmath216 the gravitational potential is almost constant in time ( according to ( [ eq / pg6/1:phantom ] ) , the expansion of the universe has a negligible effect , while the tachyonic instability gives rise to mild growth of the potential ) .",
    "in other words , the gravitational potential at @xmath217 is the superposition of random , time - independent waves with almost constant amplitude and almost constant wavelength @xmath218 . at @xmath219",
    "the amplitude of these waves decays as @xmath220 $ ] as @xmath221 increases .",
    "the period of a wave located at distance @xmath221 is seen at an angle @xmath222 .",
    "hence , this wave contributes to the multipoles with @xmath223 .",
    "the multipoles @xmath159 are not exponentially suppressed for @xmath216 , i.e. , @xmath224 $ ] , and are exponentially small in the opposite case . recalling ( [ eq / pg9/3:phantom ] ) , one finds that this behaviour of @xmath159 leads to the following dependence of @xmath177 on @xmath0 , @xmath225 in complete agreement with ( [ eq / pg14/1:phantom ] ) .",

    "this is relatively mild suppression , in accord with the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . at @xmath233",
    "the expansion of the denominator in ( [ nov29 - 1 ] ) is not legitimate , and one has to perform more sophisticated analysis leading to ( [ exact1 ] ) .      in the lorentz - invariant case",

    "we notice that the second argument of this function @xmath238 is large , @xmath239 , otherwise the overall factor in ( [ multip2 ] ) makes the effect we discuss negligibly small .",

    "on the other hand , a large value of this parameter implies that the multipoles rapidly decay with @xmath0 .",

    "we make use of the expression ( [ eqn / pg19/1:phantach ] ) and take into account the fact that the dipole has 3 degrees of freedom . in this way we find that the analysis of the dipole anisotropy leads to the limit @xmath301 the limit coming from the quadrupole anisotropy",

    "the latter property is natural in the sense that the quadrupole and higher angular harmonics are small automatically .",
    "another way to phrase this is to pretend that the observed dipole anisotropy is due to the tachyonic perturbations , i.e. , equate ( [ eqn / pg19/1:phantach ] ) and ( [ dip ] ) , and then calculate the contribution to the quadrupole from ( [ eqn / pg19/2:phantach ] ) .",

    "the octupole is suppressed by another three orders of magnitude .",

    "are still suppressed compared to the quadrupole by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "in this paper we have considered the effects on the anisotropy of cmb temperature due to possible tachyonic perturbations of dark energy .",
    "because of the exponential growth , these perturbations may generate large gravitational potential @xmath22 at the recent cosmological epoch , and only at that epoch .",
    "this results in a sizeable sachs - wolfe effect .",
    "note that the tachyonic perturbations we have discussed are unrelated to perturbations in baryons or dark matter , so their contribution to the cmb anisotropy does not correlate with the distribution of structure in the universe .",
    "our analysis was mostly motivated by the lorentz - violating models of phantom energy .",
    "hence , we have studied in detail the tachyonic perturbations with the dispersion relation ( [ dispers ] ) .",
    "we have seen that their effect on the cmb angular spectrum has a pronounced maximum whose position depends on one of the parameters , @xmath8 , and is practically insensitive to other parameters .",
    "it is expected that similar shape of the angular spectrum is characteristic to a wide class of models with lorentz - violating tachyonic perturbations , as it is closely related to the fact that these perturbations become sizeable at late times only .",
    "we have also considered tachyonic perturbations with lorentz - invariant dispersion relation ( [ eq / pg3/1:phantach ] ) . in that case ,",
    "an interesting possibility is that the largest contribution to the cmb ansotropy is received by the dipole component , and the angular spectrum rapidly decays with the increase of @xmath0 .",
    "we have seen that even if the entire observed dipole anisotropy is attributed to the tachyonic perturbations , the quadrupole component generated by them is still consistent with the observational data .",
    "it is worth noting that this result should be inherent not only in the lorentz - invariant model , but also in lorentz - violating models with tachyonic dispersion relations , provided that the `` frequency '' does not vanish at zero momentum and decreases as momentum increases .",
    "our main conclusion is that even if perturbations of the tachyonic type exist in the universe , their contribution to the cmb anisotropy is small .",
    "nevertheless , we do not exclude a possibility that growing precision of observations , and especially elaborate analysis of correlations between cmb anisotropy and structures in the universe , may lead to hints toward the possible exotic property of dark energy , the tachyonic behaviour of its perturbations .",
