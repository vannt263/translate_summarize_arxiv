    "many randomly deployed networks , such as wireless sensor networks , are properly characterized by random geometric graphs ( rggs ) . given a specified norm on the space under consideration , an rgg is usually obtained by placing a set of @xmath0 vertices independently at random according to some spatial probability distribution and connecting two vertices by an edge if and only if their distance is less than a critical cutoff @xmath1 .",
    "topological properties of rggs are comprehensively summarized in @xcite ; also see @xcite for a recent survey in the context of wireless networks . although extensive simulations and empirical studies are performed in dynamical rggs , analytical treatments of topological properties are merely done in static rggs in the previous work .",
    "a recent paper @xcite is a remarkable exception , in which the authors conduct the first analytical research on the connectivity of mobile rgg in the torus @xmath2 . in this paper , we will also present analytical results and consider a one - dimensional exponential rgg process @xmath3 evolving with time , where vertices are randomly placed along a semi - infinite line .",
    "one - dimensional exponential rggs have been recently investigated by some authors @xcite@xcite , which offer a significant variant from the familiar uniformly @xmath4 $ ] distributed nodes , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite@xcite and references therein .    in @xcite ,",
    "the distributions of distances between successive vertices rather than those of vertices themselves are examined , and as it is stated in the same paper , this assumption is more natural since `` _ _ sensors are usually thrown one by one along a trajectory of a vehicle__. '' we will then follow suit , and assume exponential distributions for inter - nodal distances of the graph process @xmath3 . every segment between two successive vertices",
    "is supposed to evolve following a stationary tear(1 ) process @xcite with exponential marginal .",
    "this linear process has no zero - defect and thus surpasses the elementary ar(1 ) process involved in @xcite .",
    "we believe such a mobile scheme has broad potential applications due to the flexible double randomness mechanism ( see section ii ) .",
    "since the evolution of connectivity and the number of components in @xmath3 are both markovian , we will address the transition probabilities and limiting distributions of these two processes @xmath5 and @xmath6 by employing markov chain theory @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that there are several markov chains coupled in our model stemming from the first order autoregressive properties endowed in the evolution of inter - nodal distances .",
    "in addition to dynamical properties , we also establish static properties for fixed @xmath7 .",
    "vertices in @xmath3 , for any given @xmath7 , form nearly a poisson point process ( more precisely , a continuous time pure birth markov process ) .",
    "the connectivity of a poisson rgg is well - studied in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite@xcite ) , especially in the context of ad hoc networks .",
    "we will investigate some topological properties basically along the lines of @xcite . in our opinion , the aforementioned simple idea in @xcite reflects a conception of one step `` memory '' essentially .",
    "we show ( in theorem 4 ) that `` 1-step memory '' + `` growth '' are not enough to produce power law distribution reminiscent of the architecture of polya urn process , where typically infinite memory generates the power law @xcite",
    ".    both finite and asymptotic analysis are given in this paper .",
    "we remark here that exact solutions are important since the asymptotic results can not be applied to real networks when not knowing the rate of convergence .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii provides the definition of the exponential rgg process and some preliminaries .",
    "section iii deals with the evolutionary properties of @xmath3 , including the transition probability , the stationary distribution and the hitting time for disconnectivity . in section iv",
    ", we present static topological properties of @xmath3 for fixed @xmath7 .",
    "the degree distribution and strong laws of connectivity and the largest nearest neighbor distances are given among other things . in section",
    "v , some concluding remarks and future research topics are discussed .",
    "the rgg process @xmath3 is constructed as a discrete time process with @xmath0 vertices deployed in one dimension on @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath9 denote the vertices of the network at time @xmath7 , for @xmath10 .",
    "set @xmath11 , for @xmath12 and @xmath13 ; see fig.1 for an illustration .",
    "we may envision time evolving upward along the @xmath7-axis and @xmath0 vertices possibly growing along the @xmath14-axis .    for @xmath15",
    ", we assume that @xmath16 evolves following : @xmath17 where the innovation sequences @xmath18 consist of i.i.d .",
    "nonnegative random variables .",
    "the behavior of this autoregressive process @xmath19 is characterized by runs of rising values ( with geometrically distributed run length ) when choosing @xmath20 , followed by a sharp fall when choosing @xmath21 without inclusion of the previous values .",
    "furthermore , we assume that @xmath22 , @xmath23 are independent for any t.    in particular , we set @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is an exponential random variable with mean @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath27 . in this case , as is shown in @xcite , the above tear(1 ) process @xmath28 would be a stationary sequence of marginally exponentially distributed random variables with parameter @xmath29 , assuming that the initial inter - nodal gaps @xmath30 are exponentially distributed with parameter @xmath29 .",
    "that means @xmath31 . in this case , the auto correlation function of @xmath16 is @xmath32 , being nonnegative .",
    "reference @xcite showed that ( [ 1 ] ) is stationary for each @xmath15 iff @xmath22 is geometrically infinitely divisible .",
    "for further extension and discussion of ( [ 1 ] ) we refer the reader to @xcite .    _ remark 1 : _ vertices in snapshot of @xmath3 yield a counting process with inter - nodal distances having distribution @xmath33 , while in standard exponential rgg , the corresponding distributions are relevant to @xmath0 the total number of vertices ( see lemma 1 in @xcite ) relying on the global information .    _ remark 2 : _ notice that the cutoff @xmath34 may depend on @xmath0 and @xmath7 .",
    "however , we restrict ourselves to fixed @xmath1 in order to keep calculations clear though some results may be generalized without much effort .",
    "the popular assumption @xmath35 is not necessary here in virtue of unbounded support resulting from inter - nodal spacing .",
