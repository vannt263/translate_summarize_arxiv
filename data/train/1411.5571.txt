    "the control of the fluctuations of an empirical process is a central tool in statistics for establishing the rate of convergence over a set of parameters of some specific estimators such as minimum contrast ones for example .",
    "these techniques have been used over the years in many papers among which van de geer  @xcite , birg and massart  @xcite , barron , birg and massart  @xcite and the connections between empirical process theory and statistics are detailed at length in the book by van der vaart and wellner   @xcite . with the concentration of measure phenomenon and talagrand s theorem  1.4  @xcite relating the control of the supremum of an empirical process over a class of functions @xmath2 to the expectation of this supremum",
    ", the initial problem reduces to the evaluation of that expectation .",
    "this can be done under universal entropy conditions which measure the massiveness of a class @xmath2 by bounding from above and uniformly with respect to probability measures @xmath3 on @xmath2 the number @xmath4 of @xmath5-balls of radius @xmath6 that are necessary to cover @xmath2 .",
    "a ready to use inequality is given by theorem  3.1 in gin and koltchinski   @xcite . roughly speaking their result",
    "says the following .",
    "let @xmath2 admit an envelop function @xmath7 ( which means that @xmath8 for all @xmath9 ) and @xmath10 be not larger than @xmath11 for some nondecreasing function @xmath12 independent of @xmath3 and satisfying some mild conditions .",
    "then , given @xmath13 i.i.d .",
    "random variables @xmath1 with an arbitrary distribution @xmath14 , @xmath15}\\le c(h){\\left[{\\sigma \\sqrt{nh{\\left({2\\sigma^{-1}{\\left\\|{f}\\right\\|}_{\\il_{2}(p)}}\\right)}}+h{\\left({2\\sigma^{-1}{\\left\\|{f}\\right\\|}_{\\il_{2}(p)}}\\right)}}\\right]}\\ ] ] where @xmath16}\\right)}\\right| } , \\label{eq - zf } \\ ] ] @xmath17 is a positive number depending on @xmath12 , and @xmath18 $ ] satisfies @xmath19 .",
    "however , computing the universal entropy of a class of functions @xmath2 is not an easy task and inequality  ( [ gine - kolt ] ) might not be so easy to use in general . for illustration ,",
    "let us consider the case of @xmath20 where @xmath0 is the set of nonincreasing functions from @xmath21 $ ] into itself and @xmath22 the @xmath23-ball centered at @xmath24 with radius @xmath25 .",
    "the universal entropy of @xmath2 , which depends on the choice of @xmath26 , is usually unknown .",
    "however , one may use that of @xmath0 , which is of order @xmath27 , to bound the universal entropy of @xmath28 from above .",
    "taking for envelope function @xmath29 the constant function equal to 1 , we derive from  ( [ gine - kolt ] ) that there exists a universal constant @xmath30 such that @xmath31}\\le c{\\left[{\\sqrt{n \\sigma}+\\sigma^{-1}}\\right]}. \\label{eq-1 } \\ ] ] while this inequality provides a satisfactory upper bound for @xmath32}$ ] in general , gin and koltchinski  @xcite ( example  3.8 p.1173 ) noticed that @xmath32}$ ] was actually of smaller order than the right - hand side of ( [ eq-1 ] ) when @xmath33 .",
    "this phenomenon is actually easy to explain and we shall see that the function @xmath33 has in fact nothing magic : if @xmath26 is decreasing very fast on @xmath21 $ ] then it is quite easy to oscillate around @xmath26 and still remain nonincreasing on @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "this implies that @xmath34 is actually massive around @xmath26 .",
    "it is however impossible to oscillate around a function @xmath26 which is constant without violating the monotonicity constraint . for a constant function @xmath26",
    ", @xmath34 turns out to be less massive and @xmath32}$ ] much smaller than that of the previous set . a general entropy bound on @xmath0 which allows to bound the entropies of all sets @xmath34 independently of @xmath35",
    "therefore provides a pessimistic upper bound in the case of a constant function @xmath35 .",
    "the above argument is not only valid when @xmath0 consists of monotone functions but more generally when @xmath0 is a bounded vc - major class on @xmath36 for instance .",
    "for such a class , the family of all level sets @xmath37 with @xmath38 and @xmath39 form a vc - class of subsets of @xmath36 .",
    "when a function @xmath40 oscillates around @xmath41 , the level set @xmath37 is a union of disjoint intervals and since the class of all unions of disjoint intervals is not vc , the elements of @xmath0 can not oscillate arbitrarily around the constant function @xmath42 .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide an upper bound for @xmath32}$ ] when @xmath2 consists of the elements of a class @xmath0 ( including the cases of vc - major and vc - subgraph classes ) which satisfy some suitable control of their @xmath43-norms or variances .",
    "the bounds we get are non - asymptotic , involve explicit numerical constants and are true as long as the random variables @xmath44 are independent but not necessarily i.i.d .",
    "they allow to improve the bounds one could obtain by using a naive upper bound on the entropy of the whole class  @xmath0 .",
    "as already mentioned , the expectations of suprema of empirical processes play a central role in statistics and it is well known ( we refer the reader to theorem  5.52 in the book of van der vaart  @xcite and to the historical references therein ) that , given a sampling model indexed by a metric space @xmath45 , the rate of convergence of a minimum contrast estimator toward a parameter @xmath46 is governed by the expectation of the supremum of an empirical process over the elements @xmath47 of a class @xmath48 lying within a small ball around @xmath49 .",
    "such connections between suprema of empirical processes and rates of convergence ( or more generally risk bounds ) of an estimator are not restricted to minimum contrast estimators and have also recently proved , in baraud , birg and sart  @xcite , to be an essential tool for the study of @xmath50-estimators . under suitable assumptions on @xmath0 and because of the phenomenon we have explained above , one can expect some faster rates of convergence for these estimators toward specific parameters @xmath51 .",
    "an illustration of this fact , which relies on the results of the present paper , can be found in baraud and birg  @xcite .",
    "we show that the @xmath50-estimator built on a class @xmath2 of densities satisfying some shape constraints achieves a rate of convergence toward some specific elements of @xmath2 which may be much faster than the minimax rate over the whole class .",
    "this phenomenon is actually not specific to @xmath50-estimators and was already observed for the grenander estimator of a monotone density which converges at parametric rate when the target density is piecewise constant , as noticed by birg  @xcite , although the minimax rate over the whole set is of order @xmath52 .",
    "our paper is organised as follows .",
    "the main definitions , including those of vc - classes , vc - major and weak vc - major classes , as well as some basic properties relative to these classes are given in section  [ ssect - def ] .",
    "the main results are presented in section  [ ssect - main ] .",
    "the proof of our main theorems , namely theorems  [ casind ] and  [ casind2 ] , are postponed to section  [ sect - pm ] .",
    "we also establish there upper bounds for @xmath53 $ ] in the special case where @xmath2 consists of indicator functions indexed by a class of sets @xmath54 since these bounds may be of independent interest . when @xmath54 is vc and the @xmath55 i.i.d . , these bounds are compared to those provided by boucheron _",
    "et al . _",
    "finally section  [ sect - pf ] gathers the proofs of our propositions and that of corollary  [ vc - m ] which is specific to the case of @xmath2 being a vc - major class and @xmath1 i.i.d .    in the sequel",
