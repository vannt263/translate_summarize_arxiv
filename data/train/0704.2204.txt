    "the mechanism suggested by @xcite for differential rotation seems to be the most widely accepted .",
    "angular momentum is continually redistributed in the deep convective envelope which occupies some 30% of the outer solar radius resulting in nonuniform rotation because the convective turbulence is affected by the coriolis force @xcite .",
    "there is good evidence that a younger sun would have rotated more rapidly and gradually lost angular momentum through magnetic coupling to the solar wind and there is currently a considerable theoretical effort to develope quantitative models of differential rotation in solar - type stars ( see , for example , reviews by @xcite and @xcite ) .    for stars other than the sun",
    ", the simultaneous detection of two or more spots at different latitudes allows a direct measurement of differential rotation .",
    "the _ most _ photometric satellite @xcite offers continuous photometry of target stars with an unprecedented precision for weeks at a time making it it possible to track spots accurately .",
    "we @xcite have already reported the detection of a pair of spots in the 2003 _ most _ light curve of @xmath10 ceti ( hd  20630 , hip  15457 , hr  996 ; @xmath11 , @xmath12 , g5v ) .",
    "the photometry was part of the satellite commissioning and prior to a considerable improvement pointing in early 2004 .",
    "the larger spot had a well - defined 8.9 d rotation period while the smaller one had a period @xmath139.3 d. only the latitude of the larger spot could be determined with any confidence .",
    "spectroscopic observations by @xcite , mostly from 2002 , of the ca  ii k - line emission reversals were also synchronized to a period of about 9.3 d. @xcite also determined a stellar radii of @xmath14 = 0.95 @xmath15 0.10 @xmath16 .    to better decipher the spot activity and rotation of @xmath17 ceti and to model spot distributions on other _ most _ targets , one of us , bc , developed the program starspotz ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it was applied first to a 2005 _ most _ light curve covering three rotations of @xmath9 eri where two spots were detected at different latitudes rotating with different periods . from this",
    ", we derived a differential rotation coefficient for @xmath9 eri ( see section 4 ) , @xmath18 , in agreement with models by @xcite for young sun - like stars rotating roughly twice as fast as the sun .    in this paper , we apply starspotz to the three separate _ most _ light curves of @xmath10 ceti  from 2003 , 2004 and 2005 .",
    "we specifically solve for the astrophysically important elements of inclination , differential rotation , equatorial period and rotation speed and find that the differential rotation profile is identical to solar.we use parallel tempering methods to fully explore the realistic parameter space and identify the global @xmath19 minimum to the data - set that signifies a best - fitting unique starspot configuration .",
    "markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) methods are then used to explore in detail the parameter space around this global minimum , to define best - fitting values and their uncertainties and to explore possible correlations among the fitted and derived parameters .",

    "the experiment was designed to detect photometric variations with periods of minutes at micro - magnitude precision and does not use comparison stars or flat - fielding for calibration .",
    "there is no direct connection to any photometric system .",
    "tracking jitter was dramatically reduced early in 2004 to @xmath211 arcsec which , subsequently , led to significantly higher photometric precision .",

    "the formal rms point - to - point precison , @xmath22 , is given in table 1 .",
    "the shapes of the light curves ultimately used for the starspotz analysis depend to a degree on just how the background is removed . despite having the summed signal values from 7 adjacent fabry images we can not interpolate a ` true ' background but subtraction of the mean",
    "background is a consistent option . in each of the three data sets used here the 7 background values are closely identical",
    "when averaged over an orbit but the differences between the extreme backgrounds can be significant when the ambient background is high ( eg . pointing close to the moon ) which is why that difference is shown in the lower panel for each light curve .",
    "we have assumed that the true errors in the individual orbital means making up each light curve are proportional to the difference between the maximum and minimum background values .",
    "these errors have been arbitrarily scaled by one - fourth for the formal starspotz analysis and these ` errors ' are shown as bars in figures 4 , 5 , and 6 .",
    "the individual bars correspond approximately to the standard deviation of the background .",
    "starspotz @xcite is a program based on spotmodel ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , that is designed to provide a graphical user interface for photometric spot modeling .",
    "the functionality included in starspotz is designed to take advantage of the nearly continuous photometry returned by _",
    "most _ to quantify the non - uniqueness problem often associated with photometric spot modeling .",
    "basically , starspotz uses the analytic models of @xcite or @xcite to model the drop in intensity caused by @xmath23 circular , non - overlapping spots . the model proposed in @xcite",
    "is used in this application .",
    "fitting can be performed by a variety of methods including a marquardt - levenberg non - linear least squares algorithm ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , or markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) functionality ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the parameters of interest are the stellar inclination angle , @xmath6 , the unspotted intensity of the star , @xmath24 , and the period , epoch , latitude and angular size of the @xmath25 spot : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 . @xcite have demonstrated how the marquardt - levenberg non - linear least squares algorithm could be used to fit the cycle to cycle variation in @xmath9 eri .",
    "@xcite investigated the same observations of @xmath9 eri demonstrating that markov chain monte carlo functionality is very helpful in defining correlations and possible degeneracies between the fitted parameters .",
    "the search for additional local minima in @xmath19 space indicating other plausible spot configurations that produce a reasonable fit to the light - intensity curve is an important part of the modeling because it allows one to quantify the uniqueness of a solution .",
    "we argue that this task of completely searching parameter space for other physically plausible local minima is better suited to a process called parallel tempering ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , discussed here in @xmath30[sectemper ] , rather than the uniqueness test methods in @xcite .",
    "the present and subsequent releases of the freely available program starspotz , including the full source - code , executable , and documentation are available at :    www.astro.ubc.ca/most/starspotz.html    release 3.0 includes the functionality discussed which allows one to fit multiple epochs of data as well as the parallel tempering functionality .",
    "as the _ most _ observations of @xmath0 ceti come from three well - seperated epochs with independent starspot groups from epoch to epoch , the fitting process was considerably more complicated than those detailed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "rather than fitting for the period , @xmath31 , of the individual spots in each epoch we derive a common equatorial period , @xmath2 , and the differential rotation coefficient , @xmath1 , among the three epochs where these are given by : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the period at latitude @xmath34 .",
    "there are five fewer parameters to be fitted because the periods of the individual spots are no longer independent variables , but completely defined by @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath34 .",
    "analyses of solar differential rotation usually include terms in sin@xmath35 @xcite but we did not expect to detect spots at such high latitudes where this term would be important .    common limb - darkening coefficients , @xmath36 = 0.684 , and flux ratios between the spot and unspotted photosphere , @xmath37 = 0.22 were assumed .",
    "the former was based on the compilations of @xcite , while the latter comes from the canonical value for sunspots ( @xmath38 k , @xmath39 k ) .",
    "the 27 parameters to be fitted are summarized in table [ tableprior ] .",
    "initial investigations of the light curves using the starspotz standard spot model indicated that different numbers of spots were required for the various epochs .",
    "the 2003 and 2005 _ most _ data - sets could be well explained by two starspots rotating with different periods , at different latitudes .",
    "the behaviour observed in the 2004 _ most _ light curve , on the other hand , required a third spot .",
    "thus the following analysis explicitly assumes two , three and two starspots for the 2003 - 2005 _ most _ epochs , respectively .    in this present application",
    "we use the same paradigm that was applied to @xmath10 ceti by @xcite , and @xmath9 eri by @xcite and @xcite where the spot parameters ( @xmath40 , @xmath34 , @xmath41 ) were assumed to be constant throughout the observations , and that the cycle - to - cycle variability observed is due solely to spots rotating differentially .",
    "other interpretations are certainly plausible including circular spots with time - varying spot sizes and latitudes such as those applied to i m peg in @xcite .",
    "the maximum entropy & tikhonov reconstruction technique of @xcite , which assumes pixellated spots of various contrasts , is another example .",
    "we feel that with the limitations of photometric spot modeling , our assumption of unchanging spot parameters is the most suitable for the timescale of the _ most _ light curves .",
    "it provides an opportunity to determine a unique solution , as well as recovering astrophysically important parameters .",
    "we recognise , given the obvious changes in the @xmath10 ceti light curve over a year , that the assumption of spot parameters constancy over a few weeks is a simplification but we do not expect significant spot migration on timescales of less than a month .      the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) functionality used in _",
    "starspotz _ is fully described in @xcite .",
    "the goal is to take an @xmath42-step intelligent random walk around the parameter space of interest while recording the point in parameter space for each of the @xmath43 fitted parameters for each step .",
    "this samples the posterior parameter distribution , which can be thought of in photometric spot modeling as simply the range in each of the @xmath43 fitted parameters that provide a reasonable fit to the light curve .",
    "the advantage of a mcmc is that it does not simply follow the path of steepest descent - resulting in the possibility that it becomes stuck in a local minimum - but allows the mcmc to fully explore the immediate parameter space .",
    "the @xmath43 parameters can thus be defined by a @xmath43 dimensional vector * y*.    t stands for the `` virtual temperature '' and determines the probability that the mcmc chain will accept large deviations to higher regions in @xmath19 space @xcite",
    ". the virtual temperature should properly be unity ( @xmath44 ) to sample the posterior parameter distribution when reduced @xmath19 is near unity .",
    "however , in photometric spot modeling , nature is often more complicated than one s model can take into account , resulting in anomalously high reduced @xmath19 values . setting @xmath45",
    "to be the minimum reduced @xmath19 value observed produces the same effect as scaling reduced @xmath19 to one , and thus effectively samples the posterior parameter distribution . in this present application",
    "@xmath46 will refer to this value of @xmath45 equal to the minimum reduced @xmath19 observed .",
    "a suitable burn - in period as described in @xcite is often used , or a @xmath19 cut where points with @xmath19 values above this user - specified minimum are excised from the analysis . a user - specified thinning factor , @xmath47 , @xcite is also used .",
    "to ensure proper convergence and mixing we employ the tests as proposed by @xcite and explicitly defined for our purposes in @xcite .",
    "we ensure the vector * r * falls as close to 1.0 as possible for each of the @xmath43 fitted parameters . the marginalized likelihood ( @xcite ; @xcite ) as described in @xmath303.1 of @xcite is used to define our 68% credible regions , while the mean likelihood @xcite is used for comparison .",
    "the mean likelihood is produced using the @xmath19 values in a particular bin of a histogram of parameter values , while the marginalized likelihood directly reflects the fraction of times that the mcmc chains are in a particular bin .",
    "peaks in the marginalized likelihood that are inconsistent with peaks in the mean likelihood can be indicative of the chains having yet to converge , or larger multidimensional parameter space rather than a better fit @xcite . in our analysis",
    "we quote the minimum to maximum range of the 68% credible regions .",
    "@xcite applied parallel tempering to a radial velocity search for extrasolar planets , as the parameter space he investigated had widely seperated regions in parameter space that provided a reasonable fit to the data .",
    "in our application as we fit for a large number of parameters , @xmath43=27 , we use parallel tempering to explore our multi - dimensional parameter space and search for other local minima in @xmath19 space indicative of other plausible solutions , and thus starspot configurations , that produce a reasonable fit to the light - intensity curve .    in parallel tempering , @xmath48 multiple mcmc chains are run simultaneously each with different values of the virtual temperature , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is an index that runs from 1 to @xmath48 .",
    "chains with higher values of @xmath45 are easily able to jump to radically different areas in parameter space ensuring that the chain does not become stuck in a local minimum .",
    "chains with lower values of @xmath45 can refine themselves and descend into local minima and possibly the global minimum in @xmath19 space @xcite .",
    "the chain with @xmath45 = 1.0@xmath51@xmath46 is the target distribution and is referred to as the `` cold sampler . ''",
    "the parameters of the `` cold sampler '' are used for analysis to return the posterior parameter distribution . a set mean fraction of the time , @xmath52 ,",
    "a proposal is made for the parameters * y * of adjacent chains to be exchanged .",
    "if this proposal is accepted than adjacent chains are chosen at random and the @xmath43 parameters * y * for each chain are exchanged . in this way , this method allows radically different areas in parameter space to be investigated in the high temperature chains , before reaching the `` cold sampler '' where a local minimum can be sought efficiently .",

    "@xmath55 was set to a larger number for the lower temperature chains to allow these chains a greater number of iterations to refine themselves and explore the low-@xmath19 areas .",
    "this was found to be a suitable compromise as the higher virtual temperature chains required fewer iterations to reach radically different areas of parameter space , while the lower virtual temperature chains required nearly an order of magnitude more iterations to reach lower areas in @xmath19 space indicative of reasonable fits to the light - curve .",

    "@xmath52 was set as 0.80 to allow for exchanges between adjacent mcmc chains on average 80% percent of the time .",
    "that means a swap is approved if @xmath57 @xmath8 @xmath52 , where @xmath57 is a random number ( @xmath58 $ ] ) .",
    "significant experimentation was needed to choose and refine suitable choices of @xmath49 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath52 .    in the present application",

    "a mediocre fit was desired to ensure that the starting point for the parallel tempering chains provided a reasonable fit to the light curve so as to reduce the required burn - in period , while not starting from within a significant local minimum so as to allow the parallel tempering chains to efficiently explore the parameter space .",
    "each of these 8@xmath5111 mcmc parallel tempering chains were then run for @xmath59=13000 exchanges , resulting in @xmath59@xmath5120@xmath514 = 1.04@xmath51@xmath60 total steps for each of the 8 `` cold samplers . ''",
    "a burn - in period was not used in this application for our analysis .",
    "rather a @xmath19 cut was used where all points of the parallel tempering `` cold samplers '' with reduced @xmath19 greater than some particular minimum , @xmath61 , were excised from the analysis .",
    "this serves a similar function to a burn - in period for the initial points , while allowing the analysis to focus on the chain points that provide a reasonable fit to the light curve .",
    "given the large number of parameters we fit for , @xmath43=27 , this is useful as the parallel tempering chains spend an inordinate amount of time exploring parameter spaces that do not provide a good fit to the data , and would otherwise complicate the analysis .",
    "a thinning factor , @xmath47 , of 20 were used in all chains for the parallel tempering analysis .",
    "the 8@xmath5111 parallel tempering chains required a total computational time of 7.0 cpu days on a pentium processor with a clock speed of 3.2 ghz with 1.0 gb of memory .",
    "this value of @xmath59 was chosen to ensure that the vector * r * , in this case * @xmath62 * ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , fell as close to 1.0 as possible for each of the @xmath63 parameters .",

    "the parallel tempering results as applied to _ most _ s 2003 - 2005 observations of @xmath10 ceti indicated that there is a single unique solution to the data - set that provides the best fit .",

    "<S> we first reported evidence for differential rotation of @xmath0  ceti in paper i. in this paper we demonstrate that the differential rotation pattern closely matches that for the sun . </S>",
    "<S> this result is based on additional _ most _ ( microvariability & oscillations of stars ) observations in 2004 and 2005 , to complement the 2003 observations discussed in paper i. using starspotz , a program developed specifically to analyze _ most _ photometry , we have solved for @xmath1 , the differential rotation coefficient , and @xmath2 , the equatorial rotation period using the light curves from all three years . </S>",
    "<S> the spots range in latitude from 10@xmath3 to 75@xmath3 and @xmath1 = @xmath4  less than the solar value but consistent with the younger age of the star . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 is also well constrained by the independent spectroscopic estimate of @xmath5sin@xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate independently that the pattern of differential rotation with latitude in fact conforms to solar .    </S>",
    "<S> details are given of the parallel tempering formalism used in finding the most robust solution which gives @xmath2 = @xmath7  days  smaller than that usually adopted , implying an age @xmath8 750 my . </S>",
    "<S> our values of @xmath2 and @xmath1 can explain the range of rotation periods determined by others by spots or activity at a variety of latitudes . </S>",
    "<S> historically , ca ii activity seems to occur consistently between latitudes 50@xmath3 and 60@xmath3 which might indicate a permanent magnetic feature . </S>",
    "<S> knowledge of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are key to understanding the dynamo mechanism and rotation structure in the convective zone as well assessing age for solar - type stars . </S>",
    "<S> we recently published values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 for @xmath9 eri based on _ most _ photometry and expect to analyse _ most _ light curves for several more spotted , solar - type stars . </S>"
