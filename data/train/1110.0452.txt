    "spike - frequency adaptation ( sfa ) is one of the main adaptation mechanisms in neural systems @xcite . as its name implies , the effect defining sfa is the observation of a scaling in the input - output relationship between the injected current ( or a stimulus property ) and the firing rate of a spiking neuron , from an initial to a stationary mapping @xcite .",
    "several mechanisms can contribute to sfa ( for example , depressing synapses @xcite ) ; however , the most prominent mechanism accounting for sfa is the presence of ( probably simultaneous ) spike - related currents , which produce a negative feedback to the neuron in time scales ranging from tens to thousands of milliseconds @xcite .",
    "even when the full impact of these currents on neural coding is not completely understood , it is known that they contribute to the processing of static as well as temporal signals . for the processing of temporal signals ,",
    "it is worth pointing out the high - pass filtering characteristics due to sfa @xcite and its related sensitivity to input fluctuations @xcite , the forward masking effect @xcite , the selectivity to complex stimuli @xcite , and the enhanced reliability of temporal coding @xcite . + for the case of static signals , given the absence of a temporal structure in the input , a neural system makes use of a rate code to represent them .",
    "a rate code is defined as the number of spikes in a certain temporal window and it is completely described by the spike count statistics @xcite .",
    "spike - related adaptation currents have a twofold impact on this code .",
    "first , they modify the tuning curve between signals and responses or the input - output relationship mentioned above , which helps to match dynamic ranges @xcite .",
    "second , they introduce negative correlations between successive interspike intervals ( isis ) in stationary neural spike trains @xcite .",
    "while the first effect reflects the modification of the _ mean _ spike count , the second effect implies a strong change in its _ variance _ ( and higher - order properties ) .",
    "this change arises from the fact that the presence of negative correlations in a point process reduces the long - term variability in the counting process that defines the rate code @xcite . taken together",
    ", both effects deeply affect the encoding reliability @xcite .",
    "the presence of negative correlations also affects the coding capabilities of other related schemes ; for example , coding of slowly varying signals through a mechanism called _ noise shaping _",
    "@xcite ( demonstrated for negative correlations arising from a history - dependent threshold , but also valid for spike - related adaptation currents ) , or adaptation - based independent codes @xcite .",
    "+ correlated single spike trains constitute a nonrenewal point process . in neural systems",
    ", this kind of process is relatively ubiquitous @xcite ( for reviews , mostly based on negative correlations , see also @xcite ) . in general , there is a coexistence of processes that evoke opposite effects on the isi correlations , and therefore on the counting statistics in single neurons ( adaptation currents and other regularizing processes such as synaptic depression and negative feedback versus filtering and input correlations , among others ) .",
    "such interesting scenarios have attracted relative attention within the theoretical neuroscience community , and several studies focus on these statistics or related properties in different situations @xcite . related with our present work , we should note three approaches that have been derived recently : a population - based scheme for adapting ensembles @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , a directed discrete representation for counting events with a general internal structure @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and a general framework for nonrenewal processes as a hidden markov model @xcite . in particular ,",
    "our work can be framed within the general approach obtained by van vreeswijk @xcite .",
    "+ in this work , based on the results we have found in a previous study about the first - passage - time ( fpt ) problem in an exponentially driven wiener process @xcite , we derive how the resulting negative correlations arise in the spike train of a dynamical , although simple , process resembling the basic features of a spike - related adaptation current added to a spiking neuron in the presence of fast additive fluctuations .",
    "the expressions we find are strictly valid in a slight adaptation regime , where the complete fpt density is not necessary and perturbation techniques can be applied , so they remain valid for other dynamical models ( with the spike - related adaptation current considered here , or similar ) . in this way , the onset of correlations due to adaptation is general across different models , provided the additive noise is fast . in the final part of the work",
    ", we use the statistics of the fpt problem and the emerging correlations due to adaptation to assess how the spike count variance decreases in comparison to an equivalent neuron without adaptation , in an asymptotic limit .",
    "this reduction in the spike count variance underlies the improvement in the decoding performance , and we show how the dependence on the correlations and on the intrinsic variability reduction due to the inhomogeneous driving shape the spike count variance reduction for different spiking frequencies .",
    "we consider an integrate - and - fire ( if ) neuron , where subthreshold dynamics of the membrane potential @xmath0 is governed by    @xmath1    external , @xmath2 , as well as internal currents , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , drive the membrane potential whenever @xmath5 .",
    "the internal current @xmath3 takes into account different interspike phenomena , such as leakage or spike initiation onset .",

    "the subthreshold dynamics is supplemented by a threshold condition , which simplifies the highly nonlinear process of a spike excursion : whenever the potential reaches @xmath8 a spike is defined and immediately , the membrane potential is set to a reset condition @xmath9 .",
    "+ several types of adaptation currents have been characterized by experiments @xcite . according to previous theoretical studies @xcite , we model the adaptation current as a process @xmath10 that decays during spikes and is incremented when a spike event occurs .",
    "in particular , we consider the adaptation current as @xmath11 , where the interspike dynamics for the adaptation process is given by    @xmath12    and a fixed increase @xmath13 is evoked at all spike times @xmath14 : @xmath15 .",
