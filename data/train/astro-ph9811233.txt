    "prompted by several successes the search for extra - solar planets has recently intensified .",
    "although the radial velocity technique ( e.g. marcy & butler 1998 ) has yielded the best candidate planets , other promising search techniques have been proposed or are underway : accurate astrometry of nearby stars @xcite , direct imaging of planets , @xcite occultation of stars by their orbiting planets , and fine structure on top of photometric microlensing lightcurves @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new technique that can be used to discover and characterize extra - solar planets .",
    "this method , using astrometric deviations in the motion of the center - of - light of microlensing events , has several promising features .",
    "first , if complete astrometric coverage of microlensing alert events were undertaken , we show that the probability of detecting any planetary system that is present can be substantial , typically greater than the probability of detecting a planetary system when photometric monitoring alone is used .",
    "second , if astrometric monitoring is added to photometric microlensing we show that in most cases the planet mass and projected orbital radius can be determined , in many cases with just a few astrometric measurements .",
    "thus the degeneracies discussed for photometric microlensing can usually be broken by adding astrometric information .",
    "this planet detection method , like the microlensing photometry method , works best for planets at intermediate distances from their star ,  in the lensing zone .",
    "it is sensitive to planets throughout the galaxy , and works well down to quite low mass planets . to be useful for this purpose ,",
    "however , the new interferometric instruments and satellites will need to be able to respond fairly quickly to microlensing alerts , and this need may affect their design and impact scheduling considerations .",
    "gravitational microlensing is now established as a method of detecting low - luminosity objects @xcite .",
    "as a low luminosity object passes near the line - of - sight to the monitored source , the source brightens in a well known achromatic and time - symmetric way .",
    "if the lens is a faint star with an orbiting planet , a more complicated  binary lens \" caustic structure is present and much more complicated photometric lightcurves are possible . for a jupiter - like planet orbiting a sun - like star ,",
    "the probability of a detectable deviation from the standard lightcurve can be substantial @xcite .",
    "encouraged by these calculations , several world - wide networks @xcite have begun actively searching for such deviations using the many dozens of bulge microlensing alerts generated yearly by the survey experiments @xcite .",
    "microlensing of a bulge star by a single lens produces two images or the star separated by several hundred microarcseconds and these images move as the lens passes near the observer - source line - of - sight .",
    "the scale of the image motion relative to the source is set by the angular einstein radius @xmath2^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are distances to the source and lens respectively .",
    "for example , the einstein radius for a @xmath5 lens at 4 kpc , with the source at 8 kpc is 550 .",
    "recent work @xcite has shown that the keck telescope is capable of angular resolution down to the sub - milliarcsecond scale .",
    "in addition , planned interferometers at the keck @xcite and vlt @xcite should have accuracies of about 10 , while nasa s space interferometry mission ( sim ) is planned to have 1  resolution @xcite .",
    "these instruments make resolution of astrometric microlensing motion a feasible prospect .",
    "several theoretical studies on this subject have been done recently @xcite .",
    ", for example , describe in detail the predicted astrometric motion of lensed images .",
    "they point out that the instruments described above will only be able to measure the motion of the center of light ( col ) , which is smaller than the motion of the two images , but which is nevertheless detectable and useful .",
    "the col motion measured by an unaccelerated observer is an ellipse , whose eccentricity is a simple function of @xmath6 , the impact parameter of the lens relative to the source .",
    "this is depicted in figure 1 .",
    "the ellipse , however , can be distorted due to the earth s motion around the sun @xcite .",
    "other effects such as blending , etc .",
    "@xcite , can also distort the ellipse .",
    "figure 1 also shows examples of the effects of earth motion ( parallax ) and blending on the astrometric ellipse .",
    "astrometric information is of interest because it can resolve the degeneracies that arise in the photometric microlensing lightcurve . in most cases ,",
    "a fit to the photometric lightcurve gives only the event duration which is a function of the three important physical quantities : lens mass , distance , and speed .",
    "addition of astrometric col information , particularly in conjunction with astrometric determination of the lens parallax , can break this degeneracy and allow determination of these physical quantities .",
    "we note here that a planet orbiting the lens , if positioned properly , can perturb the images and thereby distort the astrometric ellipse . figure  [ figplanet ] shows some examples of planetary perturbations .",
    "we see from figures 1 and [ figplanet ] a major difference between planetary perturbations and the other distortions  the planet s effect is short in duration , while parallax and blending are important over the entire duration of the microlensing event .",
    "this fact enables observers to distinguish planetary effects from the other effects .",
    "the planet s effects are of relatively short duration since a planet s einstein radius is small compared to the einstein radius of its parent star . although the time duration is small , the magnitude of the planetary perturbation can be rather large , even for earth - mass planets , as figure  [ figearth ] illustrates . in figures",
    "[ figplanet ] and  [ figearth ] we do not show the parallax and blending effects .",
    "we assume throughout that they can be independently determined .",
    "figure  [ figplanet ] shows some examples of planetary astrometry and photometry curves for @xmath7 ( e.g. a saturn mass planet orbiting a @xmath5 star ) , with @xmath8 kpc and @xmath9 kpc . throughout",
    "we will scale to an einstein diameter crossing time of @xmath10 days , a typical value for bulge microlensing @xcite .",
    "since all our calculations are done in units of the einstein radius , one can easily rescale them for other durations or for other primary lens masses or distances .    figures  [ figplanet]a and  [ figplanet]b show typical non - caustic crossing events , with deviations of about 50  lasting several days .",
    "figure  [ figplanet]c shows the large rapid motion associated with a caustic crossing , here about 200  in only a few hours . as the source crosses a caustic , a pair of images is created or destroyed and the magnification of the these two images becomes very large as they approach each other , causing rapid col motion .",
    "figure  [ figearth ] shows an example of caustic crossing for @xmath11 and similar lens parameters as above .",
    "this corresponds to an earth mass planet around a @xmath5 star . as has been discussed for photometric microlensing @xcite , finite source effects",
    "are crucial when considering small planets .",
    "we have found the same is true for astrometric microlensing .",
    "we have calculated finite source effects using two different methods .",
    "below we will discuss the method of astrometric maps , which automatically includes this effect , and which was used to calculate the curves in figure  [ figplanet ] .",
    "the finite source amplifications and centroid motion depicted in figure  [ figearth]b , however , were calculated using an ingenious technique devised by , and expanded upon by .",
    "figure  [ figearth]a shows the rapid , large - scale motion of the col for a pointlike source .",
    "note , however , that the planet s effects last a far shorter length of time than in figure  [ figplanet]c .",
    "figure  [ figearth]b shows a close - up of the effects that finite sources can have on the astrometric planetary signal . depicted",
    "are the astrometric motion for stars of radius 1,3,5,9 , & 30 @xmath12 , traversing the same path in the source plane as in figure  [ figearth]a . as expected , increasing the source size smears out the signal , so that for 30 @xmath12 the deviation is entirely washed out .",
    "notice however that for 3 and 5 @xmath12 , the signal is easily visible , meaning that earth mass planets can in principle be detected using this technique .",
    "the possibility and probability of detecting planets with photometric microlensing has been explored by several authors @xcite and was found to be substantial .",
    "we wish to compare astrometric microlensing with these studies . in most of these studies ,",
    "numerous lightcurves were generated for a range of planetary masses and projected orbital radii , and some simple detection criteria was established . in a realistic experiment ,",
    "fitting of the planetary lightcurve would need to be performed and the planet mass determined , before a planet detection was established .",
    "parameter extraction with astrometry will be discussed below , but in the following section we will just use simple detection criteria analogous to those used in previous studies .",
    "we define as a detectable perturbation , any astrometric curve that contains a deviation from the single - lens ellipse greater than a threshold amount @xmath13 for a period of time at least @xmath14 .",
    "detection thresholds and minimum durations needed will depend upon the interferometer or instrument being used , so we explore the range of detection thresholds listed in table 1 . for comparison with photometric planetary searches ,",
    "we use a photometric detection criteria similar to one used by and : a photometric deviation of at least 4% for a period of at least 6 hours .    .",
    "detection criteria for figure 3 . listed are the deviation threshold @xmath13 , the minimum time @xmath14 above threshold needed for an event to be counted as a detection , and the average time @xmath15 above threshold of events passing the cut for @xmath16 .",
    "[ table1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "for a planet of mass @xmath17 orbiting a lens of mass @xmath18 , the position of the images @xmath19 are found by solving the lens mapping equation @xmath20 , where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are the lens , planetary , and source positions projected to the complex lens plane @xcite . for a given @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23",
    "this equation is a 5th degree polynomial in @xmath24 and has 3 or 5 physical solutions corresponding to 3 or 5 images .",
    "the magnification @xmath25 of each image is the reciprocal of the jacobian determinant of this mapping evaluated at the image position @xmath26 , and the total magnification is just @xmath27 .",
    "the center - of - light ( col ) can be found from @xmath28 , and it is this quantity that is measured by an interferometer . to calculate the col motion ,",
    "one computes @xmath29 along a given source trajectory through the lens plane .",
    "this method was used in producing figures [ figearth ] and [ figfit ] .    to generate a large number of col curves and to get an overview of the astrometric motion for all possible trajectories",
    ", one can alternatively produce an  astrometric map \" of the source plane using the ray tracing technique ( schneider , ehlers , & falco 1992 , p. 303 ) .",
    "this is analogous to the magnification maps @xcite previously used in calculating photometric microlensing probabilities . using the above lens equation , one simply",
    " shoots \" many photons from all pixels of the image back to the source plane , and records the photon weighted @xmath30 and @xmath31 deflection . the resulting @xmath30-shift and @xmath31-shift",
    "maps therefore show the col shifts for a source at each position in the source planet .",
    "a col curve is created by simply tracing a trajectory through the 2 maps . to calculate the probability of detecting a planet via astrometry",
    ", we consider a complete set of trajectories ( with @xmath32 ) and find the fraction of these that pass the thresholds listed in table 1 .",
    "we then repeat this procedure for various values of @xmath33 , the projected planet - lens separation , and @xmath34 , the planet - lens mass ratio .",
    "we note that since binning of the photons is necessary , the finite source - size effect is automatically taken into account .",
    "different source sizes are easily handled by convolving the maps with a round star - sized , limb - darkened kernel .",
    "the results for a saturn ( @xmath35 ) mass planet around a @xmath5 star , with the system at a distance of 4 kpc , the source star at 8 kpc are shown in figure  [ figprob ] .",
    "the astrometric maps used to calculate this figure are themselves interesting , and these will be presented in a subsequent paper @xcite .",
    "we see that the probabilities are substantial for a wide range of planet - lens separations . for the case",
    "shown , @xmath36 corresponds to 2.2 a.u .",
    ", so the lensing zone ( @xmath37 ) corresponds to 1.3 - 3.3 a.u .    from figure  [ figprob ]",
    "we see that probabilities range from over 70% over the entire lensing zone for the optimistic sim threshold of 1   deviation down to @xmath38 for a 3  threshold . for the 10  accuracy expected from the keck and vlt interferometers , the probabilities are 20%-40% , while they are below 20% for the 100   accuracy reachable with current technology . for comparison",
    ", the dashed line at around 30% probability shows detection probabilities using photometric lightcurves , and a 4% deviation criteria . for a jupiter mass planet",
    "the probabilities are @xmath39% higher , while for a 10 earth - mass planet they are smaller by a large factor .",
    "if the new generation of astrometric instruments do as well as we have assumed , they should be excellent planet detectors .",
    "of course these probabilities should be averaged over planetary orbit orientations , and a complete exploration of the planetary mass and semi - major axis parameter space is necessary .",
    "we will present these results elsewhere , as well as a study of the the effect of the finite source size on small ( e.g. earth mass ) planets and the loss of signal when the astrometric deviation is found by subtracting a fitted astrometric curve rather than using a priori knowledge of the single lens curve . convolving the saturn mass maps with a giant star kernel results in almost unchanged probabilities , so finite source effects are not important in the saturn mass case presented here .",
    "microlensing has both disadvantages and advantages with respect to other methods of planet detection .",
    "the main disadvantage is that the entire signal is a short duration deviation on a lightcurve , so further exploration , or even attaining additional information concerning the detected planet , is probably impossible .",
    "the main advantage of microlensing is that large numbers of planets can be found throughout the galaxy and therefore statistics can be found on the frequency of planetary systems and the distribution of planetary masses and semi - major axes .",
    "most other planetary search methods are restricted to a small sample of nearby stars .",
    "since no follow - up information can be obtained , in microlensing it is clearly important to get as much information as possible during the brief planetary deviation from single - source lensing .",
    "thus , adding the two additional astrometric curves ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) should be extremely valuable . in addition , a convincing demonstration of a microlensing planet detection will require determination of the planet mass .",
    "this will be done via fitting the photometric and/or astrometric curves to extract the planetary system parameters .    to test this hypothesis ,",
    "we have constructed a simple algorithm for fitting data sets .",
    "we generated numerous simulated noisy data sets , and attempted to fit them using our automated routine .",
    "there are 8 physical parameters , 5 of which describe the primary lens and trajectory , and three of which describe the planet .",
    "the 5 primary lens parameters are the primary lens einstein radius , the minimum impact parameter @xmath6 , the einstein diameter crossing time @xmath42 , the trajectory direction , and the time of closest approach .",
    "the three planetary parameters are the planet - lens mass ratio @xmath34 , the planet - lens projected separation @xmath33 , and the planet s angular position relative to the lens .",
    "since the planet s effects on the astrometric motion and magnification are usually perturbative and short - lasting , we first fit the data sets to a single isolated lens , to extract the primary lens parameters .",
    "we then hold those parameters fixed while we fit for the planetary parameters .",
    "given this initial parameter set , we then do a fit in the full 8-dimensional parameter space .",
    "we find that our automated algorithm can almost always find a good estimate of the planetary parameters , for planetary deviations that are significant compared to the added noise . in these tests",
    "we have ignored planet - lens orbital motion and earth parallax .",
    "orbital motion adds several more parameters and will usually be small during the short planetary deviation .",
    "we note , that if in addition , astrometric parallax @xcite is found by monitoring the event long before or after the planetary deviation , then the physical size of the lens einstein radius can be found and the physical planetary mass and separation can be determined .",
    "figure  [ figfit ] shows an example data set and overlaid best fit .",
    "note that there are only 8 measurements taken during the planetary perturbation , and yet full parameter extraction was possible .",
    "it is important to note that the ability to recover physical parameters depends greatly on the noise in the signal .",
    "the example of figure  [ figfit ] uses @xmath7 , and @xmath16 , with gaussian noise of @xmath43  added to each astrometric data point and 5% gaussian noise added to each photometric data point . if we define a signal / noise by the size of the planetary deviation divided by the astrometric noise , then we find we are able to recover the input parameters reliably for a s / n greater than 4 or 5 with 6 or 7 data points during the planetary deviation .",
    "for lower s / n , we find evidence of the degeneracies discussed by starting to appear , and for even smaller s / n , parameter extraction at all becomes problematic .",
    "a more complete exploration of the effect of noise on the ability to recover parameters will be presented elsewhere @xcite .    besides noise",
    ", the sampling rate can also limit parameter extraction . since time on the new interferometers",
    "will be very valuable and hard to obtain , sampling at first may be poor , so it is important to know what happens when the assumption of complete astrometric coverage is relaxed .",
    "one would like to know the minimum number of astrometric measurements and the minimum accuracy that is needed to extract reasonable values of the planetary parameters .",
    "this work is in progress .    as an example of",
    "why astrometric data is so helpful , consider the  major image / minor image \" degeneracy discussed by . for a single lens",
    "there are two images .",
    "the minor image is dimmer and inside the critical curve ( einstein radius ) , while the major image is always brighter and outside .",
    "it is not easy to tell from photometry alone whether the planet is perturbing the major image or the minor image . during a planetary perturbation",
    "the bulk of the astrometric deviation is due to the changing image brightness rather than the image motion , so there should be a correlation between the photometric and astrometric deviations .",
    "for example , if the major image is perturbed and brightens , then the col motion will be forced outside the single - source ellipse , and the photometric deviation will be positive ( total magnification increases ) . however ,",
    "if the minor image is perturbed and brightens , the col motion will be forced inside the ellipse with a positive photometric deviation .",
    "opposite correlations exist for perturbations that cause an image to dim , so by simply correlating the col motion with the photometric deviation one easily can tell which image is being perturbed by the planet .",
    "see figure  [ figplanet ] for examples .",
    "this correlation , greatly helps in determining the position of the planet , and is used in our algorithm .",
    "the above correlation works when the perturbation is due to an image nearing the  planetary caustics \" , but we find we can also distinguish the positions for close encounters of the  central caustic \" ( see for discussion of this terminology ) .    the most crippling degeneracy discussed by arose due to finite source effects .",
    "we have begun exploring finite source effects , and will present our detailed results elsewhere ( dalal & griest 1998 ) . for the saturn mass planets of figure  [ figprob ] , these effects are small and our fitting algorithm seems to work well .",
    "by adding astrometric measurements to ongoing photometric monitoring of microlensing alerts towards the galactic bulge , one can in many cases , determine the planetary mass and projected planet - star separation .",
    "we feel this is an important reason that sim pointings should be made towards microlensing alerts .",
    "sim is still in its design phase , and it is therefore important that the satellite software and hardware be capable of responding quickly to  planetary alerts \" from the photometric microlensing planet search teams .",
    "we note ( from table 1 ) that the average time above 1  deviation for a saturn mass planet is about two weeks . on average the time spent above 10",
    "deviation is about two days , while a 30  deviation lasts 10 hours . for smaller mass planets the average durations are smaller and",
    "require faster response @xcite .",
    "we have also shown that , using our criteria , we can expect to detect and characterize a substantial fraction of planets that happen to orbit lenses , if reasonably complete astrometric monitoring is undertaken .",
    "the microlensing surveys typically produce more than 100 events a year , so microlensing has the potential to detect and characterize large numbers of planets . using astrometric and photometric microlensing , we could for the first time begin to measure the distribution of planet masses and orbital distances throughout the galaxy .",
    "we thank andreas quirrenbach for many helpful discussions .",
