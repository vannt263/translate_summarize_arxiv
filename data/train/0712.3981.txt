    "in recent years a number of unusual superconducting ( sc ) states have been discovered in different new materials @xcite .",
    "most of these materials are strongly type - ii superconductors , possessing highly anisotropic or even quasi - two - dimensional ( 2d ) electronic structures .",
    "of special interest in the present paper are sc materials showing peculiar clean - limit features at high magnetic fields and low temperatures , notably the recently discovered family of heavy - fermion compounds cerin@xmath0 ( r = rh , ir and co ) @xcite , and some of the organic charge transfer salts of the type ( bedt - ttf)@xmath1x @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the heavy - fermion compound cecoin@xmath0 , for example , which is believed to be an unconventional ( @xmath2-wave ) superconductor @xcite similar to the high - tc cuprates , exhibits the highest tc ( @xmath3 k ) among the ce - based heavy - fermion compounds .",
    "this material is characterized by exceptionally strong pauli paramagnetic pair - breaking @xcite , chandrasekhar62 due to its extremely large electron effective mass and small fermi velocity , which could lead to discontinuous ( first - order ) sc phase transitions at sufficiently high magnetic fields @xcite , maki64,@xcite .",
    "recently bianchi _ _ et.al.__@xcite have observed a dramatic changeover of the second - order sc phase transition to a first - order transition in specific heat measurements performed on this material as the magnetic field is increased above some critical values for both parallel and perpendicular field orientations with respect to the easy conducting planes .",
    "similar effect has been very recently observed by lortz _ et.al .",
    "_ @xcite in the nearly 2d organic superconductor @xmath4-(bedt - ttf)@xmath5cu(ncs)@xmath1 , but only for magnetic field orientation parallel to the superconducting layers , where the orbital ( diamagnetic ) pair - breaking is completely suppressed . under these conditions",
    "the usual ( uniform ) sc state is expected to be unstable with respect to formation of a nonuniform sc state , predicted more than 40 years ago by fulde and ferrel @xcite , and by larkin and ovchinikov @xcite ( fflo ) .",
    "the corresponding sc order parameter is spatially - modulated along the field direction with a characteristic wavenumber , @xmath6 , whose kinetic energy cost is compensated by the pauli pair - breaking energy .",
    "the critical temperature , @xmath7 , for the appearance of the fflo phase is found to equal @xmath8 . at the corresponding tricritical point",
    "the normal , the uniform and non - uniform sc phases are all met .",
    "the possibility of a changeover to first - order transitions can be effectively investigated within the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory of superconductivity since for the uniform sc phase ( i.e. for @xmath9 ) the coefficient ( usually denoted by @xmath10 ) of the quartic term in the gl expansion changes sign at a temperature @xmath11 , which coincides with @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the identity of @xmath11 with @xmath7 is peculiar to the clean limit of a superconductor with no orbital pair - breaking . in conventional s - wave superconductors",
    "electron scattering by non - magnetic impurities shifts @xmath7 below the critical temperature @xmath13 @xcite , allowing discontinuous phase transitions at temperatures @xmath14 , since ( following anderson s theorem ) @xmath10 is not influenced by nonmagnetic impurities . in superconductors with unconventional electron pairing , where @xmath10 is strongly influenced by non - magnetic impurity scattering , the situation is reversed , i.e. @xmath15 .    the interplay between orbital and spin depairing in a pure @xmath16-wave isotropic 3d superconductor was first discussed by gruenberg and gunthergruenberg66 , who conjectured ( i.e. without presenting any result for the coefficient @xmath10 ) that for @xmath17 the n - sc transition is of the second order whereas at lower field there should be a first - order transition to a uniform sc phase .",
    "houzet and buzdin@xcite have essentially confirmed this picture by exploiting order - parameter and gradient expansions in the gl theory to find that @xmath15 so that at temperatures @xmath18 , there are second order transitions to either the lo or ff phase .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the orbital effect was treated there by using gradient expansions , which is a valid approximation only at very low magnetic fields .",
    "in contrast to all the works outlined above , adachi and ikeda have recently found @xcite that , in a clean , @xmath2-wave , 2d ( layered ) superconductor , the orbital effect always shifts @xmath7 below @xmath11 . in this work",
    "the authors have used order parameter expansion in the gorkov green s function approach to the gl theory up to six order , avoiding the restrictions of gradient expansion by exploiting the lowest landau level ( lll ) approximation for the condensate of cooper - pairs .",
    "accounting for impurity scattering destroys the fflo phase and , in contrast to the pure paramagnetic situation , somewhat reduces @xmath11 .",
    "the effect of sc thermal fluctuations was found in this work to broaden the discontinuous mean - field transition at @xmath11 into a crossover .",
    "the reliance on ( fflo ) wavenumber expansion and on extensive numerical computations in this work has saved formidable analytical efforts , leaving however , interesting questions unanswered .",
    "in particular , the origin of the relative shift of @xmath12 below @xmath11 by the orbital effect found in this work , in contrast to all the other works , remains unknown .    in the present paper",
    "we develop a formalism based on order parameter expansion within the gorkov theory for a strongly type - ii superconductor , with both @xmath16- and @xmath19-wave electron pairing at high magnetic fields , which is sufficiently simple to yield useful analytical expressions for the sc free energy to any desired order in the expansion . the fundamental interplay between",
    "spin induced paramagnetic and orbital diamagnetic effects at an arbitrary magnetic field is studied , within a model of anisotropic electron systems covering the entire 3d-2d crossover range , without relying on gradient or wavenumber expansions .",
    "these advantages enable us to shed new light on the yet undecided debate concerning the order of the sc phase transitions in the presence of strong zeeman spin splitting , and to push our investigation into the unexplored region of very low temperatures , where quantum magnetic oscillations have been shown to be observable in the heavy fermion compounds settai02,shishido03 .",
    "specifically , it is found that the relevant parameter controlling the relative position of @xmath7 with respect to @xmath11 is the dimensionality of the electronic orbital motion in the crystal lattice , through its influence on the orbital ( diamagnetic )  pair - breaking effect .",
    "for a 3d fermi surface ( isotropic or anisotropic ) , where the electron motion along the magnetic field direction reduces the cyclotron kinetic energy , the shift of @xmath11 to low temperatures is larger than that of @xmath7 . in this case",
    "the kinetic energy of cooper - pairs associated with their motion along the field can compensate the spin - splitting effect , and thus leading to an increase of @xmath10 and disappearance of the first - order transition .",
    "the corresponding phase diagram is similar to that suggested in ref .",
    "gruenberg66 , where the n - sc transition is of second order , whereas the transition between non - uniform and uniform ( along the field ) sc states is of first order . in the quasi-2d limit ( i.e. for quasi - cylindrical fermi surfaces ) the enhanced orbital pair - breaking shifts @xmath7 below @xmath13 , in agreement with adachi and ikeda @xcite .",
    "our starting point is an effective bcs - like hamiltonian with a @xmath20-wave pairing interaction similar to that exploited , e.g . by agterberg and yang @xcite .",
    "the conventional @xmath16-wave situation can be similarly worked out and so will not be presented in detail here .",
    "the thermodynamical potential ( per unit volume ) for the corresponding @xmath2-wave superconductor , as expanded in the order parameter with nonlocal normal electron kernels , may be written as : @xmath21where @xmath22 is a functional of the sc order parameter , @xmath23 , having a power - low dependence @xmath24 on the global amplitude , @xmath25 , of the order parameter , and @xmath26 is a bcs coupling constant ( given in units of energy@xmath27 volume ) .",
    "the corresponding @xmath2-wave order parameter depends on both the center of mass ( @xmath28 ) and relative ( @xmath29 ) coordinates of a condensate of electron pairs : @xmath30 .",
    "it should be determined self - consistently from the corresponding pair - correlation functions .",
    "only stationary solutions are considered , neglecting quantum and thermal fluctuations .",
    "in addition the order parameter in the mean field approximation is selected as a hexagonal vortex lattice .",
    "actually this assumption is not very important since the second order term in the order parameter expansion does not depend on the vortex lattice structure whereas the lattice structure dependence of the quartic term is very weak ( for reviews see @xcite , mrvw92 ) .    for the underlying system of normal electrons",
    "we assume a simple model of quadratic energy dispersion @xmath31 and anisotropic effective mass tensor : @xmath32 .",
    "a quasi-2d situation is characterized by a sufficiently large anisotropy parameter @xmath33 , corresponding to an elongated fermi surface with a fermi momentum @xmath34 and fermi energy @xmath35 , which is truncated by the brillouin zone ( bz ) face at @xmath36 , where @xmath2 is the lattice constant perpendicular to the easy planes .",
