    "we consider the thermal convection caused by uniform volumetric heating in a horizontal layer of a fluid .",
    "the work is motivated by the current efforts to develop and commercialize liquid metal batteries - devices for short - term large - scale storage of electric energy @xcite .",
    "the battery can be schematically viewed as a vertically stably stratified system of three horizontal liquid layers : a layer of a heavy metal ( e.g. bi , sb or pbsb ) at the bottom , a layer of a light metal ( e.g. na , li or mg ) at the top , and a thin layer of a molten - salt electrolyte of intermediate density sandwiched in the middle . strong ( up to or even exceeding 1 a/@xmath0 ) nearly vertical steady electric current passes through the system during charging and discharging .",
    "it has been demonstrated in the numerical simulations @xcite that the internal joule heating of the poorly electrically conducting electrolyte causes thermal convection flow in this layer .",
    "penetrative convection is also induced in the top and , with a much smaller amplitude , bottom metal layers .",
    "the simulations have shown that the flow exists in small laboratory prototypes and should become strong and turbulent in large commercial batteries .",
    "it has also been shown in @xcite that , although a magnetic field is always induced within the battery by the electric currents flowing through it and through the adjacent connectors , the resulting magnetohydrodynamic effect on the thermal convection flow is negligibly weak unless batteries of very large size are considered .    in this work",
    "we explore the phenomenon using an idealized model of a single layer of electrolyte .",
    "the effect of the top and bottom metal layers is approximated by stress - free non - deformable horizontal boundaries .",
    "this is a reasonably good approximation of reality because , as discussed in @xcite , strong stable density stratification between the layers implies that the perturbation of the interface caused by the convection flow is insignificant except in very larger batteries with strong turbulent convection .",
    "furthermore , as an approximation justified by much higher thermal conductivity and thermal capacity of the metals , the boundaries are assumed to be maintained at a constant temperature .",
    "the natural thermal convection in horizontal layers with internal heating has been studied before ( see , e.g. , classical experiments @xcite , computations @xcite , and review @xcite ) .",
    "still , unanswered questions remain . in particular , the subcritical behavior the system considered in this paper is unknown .",
    "it has been shown using the spectral collocation method that the pure conduction state becomes linearly unstable at @xmath1 ( the rayleigh number is defined in section [ sec : model ] ) , while the energy stability analysis of the same state gives @xmath2 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the inequality @xmath3 , which is also found in other systems with internal heating @xcite , implies that convection flows exist as subcritical regimes at @xmath4 .",
    "this was computationally confirmed for the case of no - slip walls and infinite prandtl number @xcite .",
    "no such confirmations and no descriptions of the subcritical states are , however , available for many other configurations , in particular , for the configuration considered here .",
    "our interest in the flow states at small @xmath5 is related to the operation of liquid metal batteries .",
    "it is anticipated that the electrolyte layer will be thin , with the thickness of the order of few mm , in order to minimize the joule heat losses @xcite .",
    "we can estimate the rayleigh number using , as an example , the physical properties of licl - kcl at 450@xmath6 c ( see @xcite ) . in this case",
    ", @xmath1 corresponds to @xmath7 mm , a realistic value .",
    "the boussinesq approximation is used .",
    "the typical scales used to derive the non - dimensional governing equations are @xmath8 for temperature , @xmath9 for velocity , @xmath10 for length , @xmath11 for time , and @xmath12 for pressure . here , @xmath10 is the height of the layer , @xmath13 is the internal heating rate per unit volume , and @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are the physical coefficients of thermal conductivity , thermal expansivity , density , kinematic viscosity , and thermal diffusivity , all assumed constant .",
    "the equations and boundary conditions are : @xmath19 here @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are the fields of velocity , pressure and deviation of temperature from the boundary value .",
    "the @xmath23-coordinate is in the upward vertical direction .",
    "the non - dimensional flow domain is a cuboid @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "the boundaries at @xmath26 and @xmath27 are subject to periodicity conditions .",
    "the non - dimensional parameters are the rayleigh and prandtl numbers @xmath28 the constant value @xmath29 corresponding to licl - kcl at about 450@xmath6 c is used .",
    "the pure conduction state , stability of which is analyzed , is @xmath30 in the following discussion , the computed convection flows are quantified using the average kinetic energy , vertical heat flux , and nusselt number : @xmath31 where @xmath32 stands for volume averaging over the entire computational domain .",
    "time averaging over long periods of evolution of a fully developed flow is also applied for unsteady regimes .",
    "integration of the heat equation shows that the average heat fluxes through the top and bottom boundaries are @xmath33    the problem ( [ eq1]-[eq4 ] ) is solved numerically in three - dimensional and two - dimensional ( with the fields of solution being uniform in one of the horizontal directions ) formulations .",
    "the method is based on the conservative , structured - grid , finite - difference scheme of the second order in space and time introduced as the scheme b in @xcite .",
    "detailed descriptions can be found in this reference and in later works , in which the scheme was applied to incompressible flows with shear , thermal convection , and magnetohydrodynamic effects ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the results reported in the next section are computed in the domains with @xmath34 ( the small domain ) and @xmath35 ( the large domain ) , where @xmath36 is the wavelength of the neutral perturbations of the linear stability problem at @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the computational grids are uniform and have @xmath38 points in the vertical direction and @xmath39 points in the horizontal directions .",
    "the reason for such relatively crude grids is the long intervals of time @xmath40 needed in the simulations to obtain the subcritical flow regimes .",
    "we have conducted a grid sensitivity study and found that doubling the numbers of the grid points in all directions does not change the qualitative behavior and changes the quantitative characteristics @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 by less than 2% .",
    "furthermore , approximations of the critical rayleigh number of the linear instability @xmath44 have been determined computationally using the small two - dimensional domain and following the time evolution of solutions with initial conditions consisting of the base state and small - amplitude random perturbations of velocity and temperature .",
    "the results are 16952 at @xmath38 , @xmath45 and 16983 at @xmath46 , @xmath47 , which can be compared with the exact value @xmath48 .",
    "the simulations were performed in the way of solving the full system of unsteady governing equations ( [ eq1]-[eq4 ] ) . in a few runs carried out at @xmath49 we reproduced the linear instability and the subsequent transition by adding small - amplitude random perturbations to the base state and computing the solution till saturation to a stable supercritical state .",
    "the majority of runs were performed to follow the branches of such states in the continuation manner , i.e. by starting with an already computed solution , decreasing @xmath5 by a small increment , and calculating the flow s evolution until an approximation of the new state is achieved .",
    "the smallest increment @xmath50 was used at the approach to the limit points of the branches . the flow s adjustment after the change of @xmath5 was , typically , slow , requiring many thousands of time units . for this reason , in the computationally more demanding large - domain simulations , only some of the flow states , including the states near the limit point ,",
    "were calculated with full accuracy . for the other states , the approximations obtained after 3000 time units of evolution were accepted .",
    ".kinetic energy @xmath41 , vertical heat flux @xmath42 and the nusselt number @xmath43 ( see ( [ quant ] ) ) of computed stable convection flows .",
    "all fully accurately computed data are shown for the three - dimensional large domain .",
    "selected data are shown for the three- and two - dimensional small domains .",
    "the data are obtained by volume averaging . in the case of unsteady solutions indicated by the underline ,",
    "time - averaging over not less than 10000 time units is also applied .",

    "no continuation into the subcritical region is found in two - dimensional simulations .",
    "the typical spatial structure of the three - dimensional solutions is illustrated in fig .",
    "we see that the convection cells lack reflective symmetry in the vertical plane in the sense that the maximum downflow velocity is much larger ( typically about three times larger ) than the maximum upflow velocity .",
    "no such asymmetry is found in the two - dimensional solutions . in the three - dimensional flows ,",
    "the downflow zones are nearly circular in the horizontal cross - section ( see figs .",

    "the small domain always includes one convection cell . at the parameters explored in our study ( see table [ tab1 ] ) the small - domain solutions are all steady states .",
    "the behavior of the flow in the large domain is predictably more complex . at larger @xmath5 ,",
    "a pattern of 4x4 cells is observed , with some cells being stronger than the others ( see fig .  [",
    "such flows are unsteady , exhibiting irregular evolution comprising motion , growth , and decay of individual cells . at smaller subcritical @xmath5 ,",
    "the flow becomes steady state and contains a smaller number of cells .",
    "just one cell survives at @xmath5 approaching @xmath55 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2]d ) .",
    "the main outcome of our work is the demonstration of the subcritical solutions of the system .",
    "the subcritical flows have the form of three - dimensional convection cells with concentrated , approximately round in the horizontal plane zones of downward flow .",
    "the cells are not strong and result in only mild increase of the nusselt number .",
    "the difference between the flows in small and large domains is expectable and can be attributed to the various degrees of constraint imposed by the periodic boundaries .",
