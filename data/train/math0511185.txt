    "in this paper we give a complete classification of the meromorphic structure of @xmath1-functions associated to conic manifolds ; that is , general self - adjoint extensions of laplace - type operators on conic manifolds introduced by cheeger @xcite . in particular , we prove that such @xmath1-functions exhibit pathological meromorphic properties . before giving a synopsis of these pathological properties , recall that the @xmath1-function @xmath2 of a laplacian @xmath3 over a smooth closed manifold has a meromorphic extension to all of @xmath4 with only simple poles at @xmath5 with @xmath6 the dimension of the manifold and @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the situation is completely different for conic manifolds .",
    "we show that the @xmath1-function associated to a general self - adjoint extension of a laplace - type operator on a conic manifold has , as a general rule ( except for very special cases , e.g.  the friedrichs extension ) , in addition to the singularities at @xmath8 for @xmath9 , the following properties :    1 .",
    "it can have countably many poles of _ arbitrarily _ high multiplicity at  unusual \" locations on the negative real axis ; that is , at points not of the form @xmath10 .",
    "it can have _ countably _ many logarithmic singularities at  unusual \" locations .",
    "3 .   the singularities in _ ( 1 ) _ and _ ( 2 )",
    "_ can occur for the _ same _ @xmath1-function and at the _ same _  unusual \" locations .",
    "moreover , we also give an elementary and explicit algebraic - combinatorial recipe to compute the exact locations and leading coefficients of the  unusual \" poles and logarithmic singularities .",
    "in fact , the explicit computation of these exotic singularities is so straightforward ( see section [ ssec - ex ] ) that for low dimensions we can find the structure of zeta functions quickly .",
    "we also remark that one can always conjure up _ artificial _ zeta functions having _ ( 1 ) _ and _ ( 2 ) _ , but for _ natural _ ( geometric ) zeta functions , properties _",
    "( 1 ) _ and _ ( 2 ) _ seem to have no parallels in the differential geometry literature .",
    "here is a surprising , and completely natural , example of a @xmath1-function which has no meromorphic extension to all of @xmath4 . we first review conic manifolds",
    "let @xmath11 be an @xmath6-dimensional compact manifold with boundary @xmath12 and let @xmath13 be a smooth riemannian metric on @xmath14 .",
    "we assume that near @xmath12 there is a collared neighborhood @xmath15 where @xmath16 and the metric @xmath13 is of product type @xmath17 with @xmath18 a metric over @xmath12 .",
    "such a metric is called a _ conic metric _ and @xmath11",
    "is called a _ conic manifold _ , ideas introduced by cheeger @xcite ( cf.@xcite ) . using a liouville transformation over the collar @xmath19 as in @xcite , we can identify @xmath20 with @xmath21 and the scalar laplacian @xmath22 can be identified with @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the laplacian over @xmath12 . notice that @xmath25 because the function @xmath26 has the minimum value @xmath27 ( when @xmath28 ) .",
    "let us now assume that @xmath29 so that @xmath30 we remark that the term @xmath31 can be considered a  singular potential , \" and such laplacians and their self - adjoint extensions have been studied by physicists since the 70 s @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath24 always has the eigenvalue @xmath32 .",
    "let us assume that @xmath32 is the only eigenvalue ( counting multiplicity ) of @xmath24 in the interval @xmath33 ; this is the case for the euclidean laplacian on a punctured region in @xmath34 , for in this case , @xmath24 is just the laplacian on the unit circle which has eigenvalues @xmath35 .",
    "then @xmath36 has exactly one eigenvalue in the interval @xmath37 , the eigenvalue @xmath27 , and ( see section [ s : sae ] ) @xmath22 has many different self - adjoint extensions , each of which is parameterized by an angle @xmath38 ( cf.@xcite ) .",
    "it turns out that @xmath39 corresponds to the so - called friedrichs extension @xcite , and any extension has a discrete spectrum @xcite .",
    "consider any one of the extensions , say @xmath40 with @xmath38 , and form the corresponding @xmath1-function @xmath41 where the @xmath42 s are the eigenvalues of @xmath40 .",
    "the surprising fact is that the meromorphic extension of _ every _ such @xmath1-function corresponding to an angle @xmath43 _ except _ @xmath44 ( the friedrich s extension ) has a logarithmic singularity at @xmath45 .",
    "more precisely , as a consequence of theorem [ main thm2 ] , for @xmath46 , we can write @xmath47 where @xmath48 with @xmath49 the euler - mascheroni constant and @xmath50 has a meromorphic extension over @xmath4 with the  regular \" simple poles at the well - known values @xmath51 for @xmath52 .      brning and seeley s regular singular operators @xcite generalize the example of the laplacian on a conic manifold as follows .",
    "let @xmath11 be an @xmath6-dimensional compact manifold with boundary @xmath12 and we assume that near @xmath12 there is a collared neighborhood @xmath19 such that @xmath15 where @xmath16 and the metric of @xmath11 is of product type @xmath53 with @xmath18 a metric over @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath54 be a hermitian vector bundle over @xmath11 and let @xmath3 be a second order _ regular singular operator _ acting on @xmath55 ; this means that @xmath3 is an elliptic symmetric nonnegative second order differential operator such that the restriction of @xmath3 to @xmath19 has the form @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a laplace - type operator over @xmath12 with @xmath25 .",
    "( the condition @xmath25 is necessary otherwise @xmath3 is not bounded below @xcite . ) laplacians on forms and squares of dirac operators on conic manifolds @xcite are examples of second order regular singular operators .",
    "we can also deal with the case when @xmath11 has boundary components up to which @xmath3 is smooth ; at such components , put local boundary conditions .",

    "we can endow @xmath63 with a symplectic structure as described in section [ s : sae ] .",
    "then the self - adjoint extensions of @xmath3 are in a one - to - one correspondence to the lagrangian subspaces in @xmath63 . given a lagrangian subspace @xmath64 in @xmath63 , we denote by @xmath65 the self - adjoint extension corresponding to @xmath64 .",
    "one of the natural questions for a given self - adjoint extension @xmath65 is whether the @xmath0-function of @xmath65 , @xmath66 , would have a meromorphic extension over @xmath4 and if so , what the pole structure is . here",
    "the @xmath0-function of @xmath65 is defined by @xmath67 for @xmath68 where @xmath42 s are the eigenvalues of @xmath65 .",
    "the @xmath0-function has been studied in many papers for the friedrich s extension or with the condition @xmath69 , which implies that @xmath3 is essentially self - adjoint @xcite . for scalable extensions ( extensions for which the domain is invariant under @xmath70 ) ,",
    "the @xmath1-function has been studied in @xcite .",
    "there are no  unusual \" phenomena with these cases .",
    "finally , for arbitrary self - adjoint extensions with @xmath71 , the @xmath1-function has been studied by falomir , muschietti and pisani  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) for one - dimensional laplace - type operators over @xmath72 $ ] and by mooers @xcite who was the first to study the general case of operators over manifolds and who noticed the presence of  unusual \" poles .",
    "however , the works @xcite only imply the existence of _ simple _  unusual \" poles and do not imply the existence of poles of arbitrary order nor of logarithmic singularities of the @xmath1-function .",
    "we now outline this paper .",
    "we begin in section [ s : statement ] by giving the statement of our main result , theorem [ thm - main ] , and we also illustrate the ease of applying the main result by giving examples ; in particular , we re - derive the main result of @xcite and we show that poles of arbitrary order and countably many logarithmic singularities show up even for simple situations .",
    "we also show how our theorem simplifies when we make assumptions on the self - adjoint extensions and we present corresponding resolvent and heat kernel expansions .",
    "mooers @xcite description of self - adjoint extensions as lagrangian subspaces plays a key rle in the proof of our main result and because of this reason , in section [ s : sae ] we briefly review this important topic .",
    "the main technical task of the proof of our main theorem is the explicit form of the parametrix of the resolvent of @xmath65 near the boundary .",
    "this is handled by solving model problems explicitly over a finite interval employing theorem [ thm - res ] , which is a new representation of the resolvent in terms of an implicit eigenvalue equation , and the contour integration method @xcite .",
    "the presentation and details of the solutions of the model problems are given in sections [ s : modelproblems ] , [ s : modelzeta ] and [ s : model ] .",
    "the results for the model problems and a parametix construction then enable us to prove all the theorems listed in section [ s : statement ] below .",
