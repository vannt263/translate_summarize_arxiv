    "in addition , we show the eigenvalue of the @xmath4-wave gap equation @xmath79 obtained for @xmath78 .",
    "the increment of @xmath79 for @xmath176ev is consistent with the increment of @xmath6 under pressure observed experimentally . in the present calculation , the intra - pocket attractive interaction is large whereas the interaction between hole- and electron - pockets is small because of the cancellation between attractive and repulsive interactions .",
    "for this reason , we find that both the @xmath111-wave and @xmath110-wave states can appear depending of the model parameters , and the impurity - induced @xmath177 crossover is easily realized .",
    "note that @xmath105 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ap2 ] is smaller than unity , meaning that @xmath105 given in the main text is overestimated due to the simplified analysis .          in the main text",
    ", we studied the gap function in fese for @xmath136mev , in which the horizontally - long electron - like fs is realized around the x - point . here , we study the gap function for @xmath182mev , in which the electron - like fs is divided into two dirac cones .",
    "we note that the experimentally observed orbital splitting is @xmath183 , where @xmath184 is the renormalization factor for @xmath185-orbitals @xcite .",

    "the fss and bandstructure are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ap3 ] ( a ) : the dirac cones around x - point are electron - like . the susceptibilities obtained by the sc - vc theory for @xmath76 at @xmath77 mev [ @xmath187 are shown in fig . [",
    "fig : ap3 ] ( b ) . here , we dropped the vc for the spin susceptibility as we did in the main text .",
    "figure [ fig : ap3 ] ( c ) shows the @xmath4-wave gap function for @xmath188 . here",
    ", the gap is large on the fss with large @xmath52-orbital component , since large intra - pocket and inter - pocket attractive force are caused by large @xmath139 at @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",

    "the position of the nodal part on hole - fs is consistent with the experimental report @xcite .",
