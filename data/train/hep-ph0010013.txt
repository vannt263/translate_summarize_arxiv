    "the masses of the ground state doublets of s - wave heavy - light mesons ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) are well known experimentally , and thus provide a testing ground for the lattice method . in particular , they can be used to examine the convergence properties of the heavy quark expansion in nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd),@xcite which is the most economical lattice action available for heavy quark physics.@xcite    the spectrum of p - wave heavy - light mesons is not yet understood , experimentally nor theoretically , so here the lattice can offer predictions . do the masses follow the ordering that is observed in the hydrogen atom ? what are the magnitudes of the mass splittings among p - waves  tens of mev or hundreds ?",
    "lattice studies of the p - wave spectrum have been performed for an infinitely - heavy quark@xcite .",
    "a subset of the p - wave states have also been observed by using a relativistic ( clover ) action in the charmed region , and extrapolating to the bottom region@xcite .",
    "recently , the lattice nrqcd approach has been used to work directly with @xmath4 mesons@xcite as well as @xmath5 mesons@xcite .    in the following sections , the lattice nrqcd method is briefly reviewed and the results of numerical simulations are presented .",
    "implications for the convergence of the lattice nrqcd expansion are discussed , and predictions for the @xmath4 and @xmath5 mass spectra from various lattice simulations are compared to theoretical models .",
    "the application of lattice nrqcd to heavy - light mesons entails an expansion of the action in inverse powers of the heavy quark mass @xmath6 , @xmath7 where @xmath8 has no heavy quark fields , and@xcite @xmath9    @xmath10    the chromoelectric and chromomagnetic fields are @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively , and @xmath13 denotes the lattice derivative .",
    "the coefficients @xmath14 are usually set to their classical values ( @xmath15 ) in lattice nrqcd simulations .",
    "this assumes that perturbative corrections at momentum scales beyond the lattice cutoff ( i.e. the inverse lattice spacing ) are small .",
    "nonperturbative contributions to the @xmath14 coefficients are not neglected , and appear explicitly in eqs .",
    "( [ action]-[dh3 ] ) via the tadpole factors , mentioned below .",
    "a tilde on any quantity indicates that the leading classical discretization errors have been removed . besides this classical improvement , a mean - field form of quantum improvement",
    "is also implemented through the introduction of two `` tadpole factors '' , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , following the well - known suggestion of lepage and mackenzie@xcite .",
    "notice that the action of eqs .",
    "( [ action]-[dh3 ] ) allows different lattice spacings , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , in the spatial and temporal directions ; hence two tadpole factors are required .",
    "various choices for the light quark and gauge field action , @xmath8 of eq .",
    "( [ action ] ) , have been considered . in the lattice nrqcd simulations of refs .",
    "@xcite , the gauge field portion is classically and tadpole - improved , whereas the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite chose the unimproved wilson gauge field action .",
    "for the fermion portion , refs .",
    "@xcite employ the tadpole - improved clover action@xcite while ref .",
    "@xcite uses a more highly improved d234 action@xcite .",
    "when the heavy quark mass is sufficiently large and the lattice spacing sufficiently small ( but not small compared to the inverse heavy quark mass ) , one expects the predictions of these actions to agree .",
    "lattice nrqcd simulations typically produce a clear signal for the s - wave heavy - light meson masses , so they are convenient observables to use for testing the heavy quark expansion . since the leading contribution to the heavy quark mass does not appear explicitly in the nrqcd action , only mass differences ( or more generally energy differences ) can be computed .",
    "the absolute mass scale can be extracted from the kinetic energy of a meson , @xmath20 to the desired order in @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are taken from lattice simulations , and the `` kinetic '' mass @xmath24 is thus obtained .    the first three orders in the @xmath25 expansion of eqs .",

    "the charmed results of ref .",
    "@xcite are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : sdiff ] . in this plot ,",

    "fig : sdiff ] has @xmath29 and @xmath30 corrections which are roughly equal , at about 20% each , and the @xmath31 splitting acquires 20% and 10% corrections at @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively .",
    "firm statements about convergence , or lack thereof , for the @xmath25 expansion are difficult to support with only these data .",
    "the first correction terms are not far from their expected size , @xmath32 , but the @xmath30 corrections are perhaps larger than might have been hoped .",
    "these spin splittings are clearly smaller than the experimental values@xcite @xmath33_{\\rm expt } & = & 141 { \\rm ~mev } , \\\\",

    "the quenched results are shown beside the experimental data in table [ tab : b ] .",
    ".quenched lattice nrqcd results for the s - wave bottom mesons@xcite compared to experimental data@xcite , in units of mev . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "it is more difficult to extract a signal for the p - wave masses from lattice simulations .",
    "creation operators which extend over more than a single lattice site need to be tuned to enhance the signal .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the p - wave masses were studied at @xmath34 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 for both charmed and bottom mesons .",
    "subleading contributions were found to be smaller than the statistical uncertainties .",
    "[ fig : models ] compares the splitting between two p - wave masses ( j=0 and j=2 ) as obtained from lattice calculations and from various models.@xcite for the @xmath4 system , most methods predict a splitting between zero and 80 mev .",
    "the discrepancy between the two lattice results is somewhat disconcerting .",
    "both computations employed quenched lattice nrqcd and both had a temporal lattice spacing of about 0.1 fm .",
    "@xcite used an improved gauge action with a spatial lattice spacing of 0.2 fm , a highly - improved ( d234 ) light - quark action and an ensemble of 2000 configurations .",
    "@xcite used the unimproved ( wilson ) gauge action with a spatial lattice spacing near 0.1 fm , the improved clover action for light quarks and an ensemble of 102 configurations .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the ratio of @xmath35 correlation functions falls monotonically as euclidean time increases , and of course statistical uncertainties grow as euclidean time increases .",
    "thus , if the meson mass is extracted from a region which begins too near the initial time , the predicted mass splitting would be too large . with this in mind , it is noted in ref .",
    "@xcite that , even at the smallest euclidean times , those lattice data can not reproduce the large splitting of ref .",
    "@xcite . instead , ref .",
    "@xcite arrives at a plateau - independent upper bound of 100 mev for the @xmath36 splitting .",
    "lattice efforts are ongoing , and we look forward to a clearer understanding of the @xmath5 and @xmath4 spectra .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : modelp0 ] , the splitting between s and p - wave mesons is shown .",
    "the lattice results of boyle are interesting in that they do not rely on nrqcd.@xcite",
    "the convergence of lattice nrqcd has been studied up to @xmath30 for both s and p - wave heavy - light mesons .",
    "the only cause for concern seems to be the s - wave spin splitting for charmed mesons , where a definitive statement can not yet be made about convergence .",
    "the p - wave masses have recently come under study with lattice nrqcd .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite indicate that the @xmath5 splittings are @xmath37 or smaller , while the @xmath4 splittings are @xmath38 or smaller . however , the lattice work reported in ref .",
