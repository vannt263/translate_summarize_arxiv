    "ground based observations of stars in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) have recently revealed a population of red - clump stars that appear brighter by about 0.9 magnitude than the peak of the principal red clump distribution ( zaritsky & lin 1997 , hereafter zl97 ) . after considering and rejecting various possible explanations ,",
    "zl97 argue that these red - clump stars belong to a spatially localized intervening population of stars along the line - of - sight to the lmc , at a distance of about @xmath0 . zl97",
    "present corroborating evidence for this interpretation from hst observations of lmc stars ( holtzman 1997 ) .",
    "these data show a faint trace of a secondary lower main sequence population which is shifted by 0.9 mag and has a fractional surface density similar to that of the brighter red - clump stars ( @xmath1 ) . using the derived distance and estimated projected density of the proposed intervening population",
    ", zl97 derived an optical depth for gravitational lensing which is within a factor of two of the observed value , thus suggesting that machos with masses in the range of @xmath8 comprise at most a small fraction of the galactic dark halo .",
    "these findings seem to support an earlier suggestion ( zhao 1997 ) that the observed gravitational microlensing events toward the lmc may be due to a low surface - brightness dwarf galaxy or the tidal debris of a disrupted system at the foreground of the lmc .",
    "such interpretation of the microlensing data would have major implications for the nature of the dark matter , and thus should be tested in every conceivable way .",
    "several potential tests have already been suggested : ( a ) looking for spatial correlations between the red - clump and the brighter red - clump stars in fields farther from the lmc center , as attempted by zl97 who found suggestive support for the foreground population hypothesis ; ( b ) analyzing variable stars in microlensing databases , as performed by alcock ( 1997b ) who excluded the possibility of a dwarf galaxy along the l.o.s .  to the lmc out to a distance of @xmath9 ; examining surface - brightness maps within large areas around the lmc ( gould 1997 ) ; and ( d ) looking for differences in the radial velocity distributions of the principal red - clump and brighter red - clump stars , as suggested by zl97 .    in the present paper ,",
    "we suggest a method utilizing the observed microlensing events themselves to discriminate between the possibilities that they arise in a standard halo distribution of machos , or in an intervening stellar population at @xmath10 .",
    "we demonstrate that the distribution of event durations should be different in these two cases , and examine the likelihood that the observed events are drawn from either population (  2 ) . using monte carlo simulations",
    ", we estimate the number of events required to safely rule out either hypothesis . in ",
    "3 we discuss possible implications of the results to the nature of the lensing population , and to the low - mass end of the stellar imf .",
    "the characteristic timescale of a gravitational lensing event towards the lmc is given by  =   2r_e v_t   4 ^1/2 v_t",
    "c , [ def_t_hat ] where @xmath11 is the einstein radius , @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the distance to a lensing object of mass @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the lmc distance ( @xmath16 ; feast & walker 1987 ) , and @xmath17 is the transverse velocity of the einstein ring relative to the line - of - sight to the source .",
    "therefore , the shape of the distribution of event durations depends on the density distribution of lenses along the l.o.s . , @xmath18 , their velocity distribution , and their mass function .",
    "these ingredient distributions are very different in the two cases between which we wish to discriminate . in the case of a dark halo distribution of",
    ", @xmath18 is reasonably well determined , and the distribution of transverse velocities can be derived by assuming an isothermal velocity distribution , taking into account the solar and lmc motions .",
    "the macho mass function is a priori unknown .",
    "by contrast , in the case of the intervening population proposed by zl97 , all the lenses are at nearly the same distance , @xmath19 , and have similar transverse velocities .",
    "the reason for the latter is the following : the angular size of the intervening system must not be much smaller than that of the lmc since otherwise microlensed stars would have appeared clustered in a limited area of the lmc ( maoz 1994 ) .",
    "in addition , the mean surface mass density of the intervening population should not exceed _",
    "int  44 ( _ obs 2.910 ^ -7 )   ^-2 in order to be consistent with the inferred optical depth for microlensing toward the lmc ( alcock 1997 ; hereafter a97 ) . if the intervening system is bound , the dispersion in transverse velocities is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the system s characteristic radius .",
    "this yields @xmath22 , which is very likely to to be negligible relative to the motion of the entire intervening system . in the case of an unbound or a tidally disrupted system , the total solid angle of the intervening structure",
    "must be much smaller than @xmath23 since otherwise its total mass would be @xmath24 , which exceeds the entire mass of the dark halo .",
    "thus , if the intervening population is to be relatively confined in space , its velocity dispersion must be much lower than the circular velocity in the halo , @xmath25 ( any possible large - scale velocity gradient along a tidal tail would not introduce much of a dispersion in the velocities of those intervening stars within the small solid angle of the lmc ) . we conclude that the distribution of event durations should directly reflect the mass function of the intervening population .",
    "again , in contrast to the a priori completely unknown macho mass function , it is reasonable to expect that the stellar mass function in the intervening population is not significantly different from that in the galactic disk .      in the case of the intervening stellar population proposed by zl97 , we can approximate the lens distribution along the l.o.s to the lmc by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , and the transverse velocity distribution of the stars by @xmath28 , where v_t  =     transverse velocity vector of the intervening system , and @xmath29 is the transverse velocity of the line - of - sight to the source , at the distance of a lens , given by _",

    "the differential event rate is d  =  2 ( ) ^1/2 v_t r_e(m_,x_int ) d , [ def_dgdm ] where @xmath38 , @xmath39 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ def_t_hat ] ) , and @xmath40 is the present day mass function of the intervening stellar population , normalized such that @xmath41 .",
    "although the universality of the stellar mass function is yet to be proven , it is reasonable to assume that @xmath40 is not significantly different from the stellar mass function in the galactic disk .",
    "the understanding of the stellar mass function has advanced substantially since the concept of the imf was introduced by salpeter ( 1955 ) , but at the low - mass end ( @xmath42 ) , the results of various workers have been discrepant ( see miller & scalo 1979 ; simons & becklin 1992 ; kroupa , tout & gilmore 1993 ; comeron 1993 ; tinney 1993 ) . on one hand , there are claims for a turnover in the mass function at @xmath43 , supported by observations of star forming regions ( hillenbrand 1997 ) and by possible evidence for a falling imf at masses below the h - burning limit ( @xmath44 from observations of proto - brown dwarf clumps ( pound & blitz 1995 ) , thus suggesting that brown dwarfs exist in such small numbers as to make a negligible contribution to the mass density of the galactic disk . at the other extreme , there are claims for a steeply rising mass function all the way down to the h - burning mass limit ( mera , chabrier , & baraffe 1996 ) , implying a substantial amount of brown dwarfs in the galactic disk ( see also tinney 1993 ) .",
    "the shape of the low - mass end of the imf is likely to be better determined in the next few years ( due to deep ir searches for brown dwarfs ) , but at present we can not rule out either possibility .",
    "thus , we shall explore two mass functions which differ significantly at low masses : ( a ) the miller and scalo model ( 1979 ; hereafter ms79 ) where the imf is fit by a lognormal distribution with a slope @xmath45 , @xmath46 ( turns over at @xmath47 ) , and ( b ) the three - component power - law fit of kroupa , tout , and gilmore ( 1993 ; hereafter ktg93 ) , which is monotonically rising down to the h - burning limit , extended here down to a jupiter mass @xmath48 the cutoff mass is introduced because the imf can not rise indefinitely , but the choice of a jupiter mass is arbitrary .",
    "we note that the results will not be sensitive to the exact cutoff mass since the detection efficiency for very short events is low .",
    "let us define @xmath49 as the crossing time of an einstein ring due to one solar mass object at a distance of the intervening system , =   166 ( v_t 200 ) ^-1 [ def_tsun ] where @xmath17 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ def_vt ] ) . transforming @xmath50 ( eq .  [ [ def_dgdm ] ] ) into @xmath51 , we obtain for the ms79 mass function   ( / ) ^-2[(/ ) + 1 ] [ def_ms79 ] and for the extended ktg93 mass function @xmath52 figure 1-a presents examples of both event distributions in the case of @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the event distribution in the case of a dark halo which consists of single mass machos with a maxwellian velocity distribution , taking the solar and lmc motions into account , is ( alcock 1996 )   1 m ^4 _ 0 ^ 1dx ( x ) r_e^4(x , m ) e^-q(x , m ) e^-[(x)/v_c]^2 i_0[p(x , m ) ] [ halo_rate]where @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 is the modified bessel function , and @xmath58 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ def_vlos ] ) .",
    "we shall consider here only a `` standard halo '' dark matter distribution of equal mass machos ( a97 present two examples of event distributions due to power - law mass functions , which closely resemble those due to equal mass machos ) .",
    "following griest ( 1991 ) , we take @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the galactocentric radius , @xmath61 is the core radius , and @xmath62 is the sun s distance from the galactic center . the density along the l.o.s .  to the lmc",
    "is @xmath63 , where @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",
    "our ultimate goal is to rule out either the zl97 intervening population hypothesis or the standard halo of machos hypothesis by showing that it is extremely unlikely that the observed event durations were drawn from the predicted event distribution . in order to do that we need to take the detection efficiency of the relevant experiment into account .",
    "we shall test here the first eight macho events toward the lmc ( a97 ) against the predicted event distributions , @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the detection efficiency for the first two years of macho data ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the eight event durations are shown at the bottom of figure 1-b , along with examples of the predicted event distributions .",
    "figure 3 shows the results of kolmogorov - smirnov tests ( press 1992 ) , where @xmath68 is the probability of getting a k - s deviation worse than the observed value , namely , the significance level at which we can reject the null hypothesis that the data were drawn from a given distribution .",
    "for example , we can reject at the 0.1 significance level the hypotheses that the data were drawn from ( a ) the zl97 intervening population with an extended ktg93 imf when @xmath17 is either below @xmath69 or above @xmath70 ,  ( b ) the zl97 intervening population with an ms79 imf when @xmath71 ,  and ( c ) a standard halo distribution of single - mass machos with @xmath72 .",
    "all remaining possibilities are currently consistent with the data , the more so for larger @xmath68 .",
    "we see that the most likely macho mass in a standard halo model is @xmath73 , as concluded by a97 , but the zl97 intervening population with an ms79 imf and @xmath74 is equally consistent with the present data .",
    "eight events are clearly not enough for discriminating between the various hypotheses .",
    "the macho experiment has yielded so far an additional six events toward the lmc ( charles alcock , private communication ) , but these are not yet publicly available .",
    "we performed monte carlo simulations to estimate the number of events required to safely rule out either the standard halo or the intervening population hypothesis , assuming the other hypothesis is correct ( figure 4 ) .",
    "we find that a sample of @xmath75 events will enable to rule out a significant fraction of the parameter space with @xmath76 confidence level , but about @xmath77 events will be required to completely rule out either hypothesis .",
    "however , this is the worst case scenario estimate for several reasons : ( a ) we assumed a detection efficiency similar to that for the first two years of macho data , but @xmath67 is likely to improve with time , especially at long event durations due to the increasing baseline ; ( b ) the simulations assume that the true event distributions are those with @xmath17 and @xmath14 that best fit the present data , which need not necessarily be the case ; ( c ) our understanding of the low - mass end of the stellar imf may improve in the near future due to , for example , deep ir searches for brown dwarfs ; and finally , ( d ) the permissible range of @xmath17 could be narrowed by subsequent investigations , as we discuss below",
    ".    the transverse velocity of the zl97 intervening population , @xmath78 , could generally be anything between zero and the escape velocity from the galaxy , though not at equal probabilities : assuming a probability distribution for @xmath79 similar to the velocity distribution function in an isothermal halo , @xmath80 , we find that the probability distribution for @xmath17 ( defined in eq .",
    "[ [ def_vt ] ] ) is p(v_t)dv_t  =   ( v_t / v_c ) i_0(v_t /v_c^2 ) dv_t [ prob_vt ] [ def_prob_vt]where @xmath81 .",
    "it peaks at @xmath82 , but the distribution is quite broad",
    ". it may be possible to derive the transverse velocity of the intervening population by a careful re - examination of the data which led to the determination of the lmc s proper motion ( jones 1994 ) .",
    "alternatively , if the radial velocity of the proposed intervening population is measured , then dynamical models may well constrain its transverse motion .",
    "theoretical models may also yield predictions for the transverse velocity .",
    "for example , zhao ( 1997 ) suggested that the lensing population toward the lmc may be a part of a tidal debris tail in the magellanic great circle , in which case the tidal tail and the lmc are expected to have similar specific angular momentum . neglecting the offset of the sun from the galactic center and substituting @xmath83 in eq .",
    "[ [ def_vt ] ] , we obtain for that scenario @xmath84 . therefore , the statistical test proposed in this paper may rule out various theories for the origin and nature of the intervening population with fewer events than estimated above .",
    "if the observed microlensing events toward the lmc are due to the intervening stellar population proposed by zl79 , then the currently observed range of event durations ( @xmath85 days ) directly implies a lens mass range of @xmath86 , which happens to bracket the mass of @xmath6 where many investigations claim that the stellar imf peaks ( see references in  2.1 ) . on the other hand , if the observed events are due to a halo distribution of machos , then the typical macho mass is @xmath87 ( a97 ) .",
    "these objects can not be h - burning stars due to observational constraints from deep star counts ( gould , bahcall & flynn 1997 ) , thus leaving the alternatives of primordial white dwarfs and sub - stellar mass black holes .",
    "it is intriguing that the zl97 intervening population hypothesis could provide a more `` natural explanation '' for the observed range of event durations .",
    "we propose a way to test not only the existence of a stellar population at the foreground of the lmc , but more importantly , the possibility that the observed microlensing events are primarily due to such an intervening population .",
    "since the test relies on the shape of the stellar imf , it could provide invaluable insight into the mass function below the h - burning mass limit if the zl97 intervening population hypothesis is independently confirmed .",
    "figure 3 could already tell us that if @xmath88 then a miller - scalo type of an imf is much more likely than a monotonically rising one , and vice - versa if @xmath89 .",
    "alcock etal ( 1996b , hereafter a96 ) placed strict limits on the contribution of low - mass machos to the dark halo , based on the absence of detected events with durations of @xmath90 days .",
    "if the observed events are due to the zl97 intervening population , this null - detection provides an upper limit to the mass fraction in low - mass brown dwarfs . we can estimate the number of expected events due to , for example , @xmath91 objects by scaling the a96 results : denoting the fractional contribution of such objects to the total intervening mass by @xmath92 , the expected number of short events is @xmath93 , where 35 is the expected number of events due to machos in this mass range , assuming they make the entire mass of a standard dark halo ( a96 , fig .",
    "10 ) , @xmath94 is the microlensing optical depth inferred from the observations , and @xmath95 is the predicted optical depth through a standard dark halo . since @xmath96 ( a97 ) , we expect @xmath97 short events in the case of the intervening population hypothesis . for @xmath98 ,",
    "the poisson @xmath99 confidence level upper limit is 3 events , so we obtain an upper limit of @xmath100 to the mass contribution of @xmath101 objects to the stellar imf .",
    "this limit will continuously improve with time as long as no short events are detected .",
    "constraining the contribution of lower mass objects to the stellar imf requires a detailed analysis which is beyond the scope of this paper since the detection efficiency of `` spike '' events does not depend only on @xmath102 ( a96 ) .",
