    "cavity optomechanics has undergone tremendous growth owing to recent advances of nano- and micro - fabrication , culminating in the cooling of macroscopic mechanical objects to near the ground state  @xcite .",
    "further developments promise a variety of applications , for example precision measurements of feeble forces , masses and displacements  @xcite , coherent control of quantum states for quantum information science  @xcite and fundamental tests of quantum mechanics with macroscopic objects  @xcite , to mention just a few .    the linear optomechanical coupling of a cavity field to the position of a mechanical mode is typically modeled using a fabry - p ' erot cavity with a moving end mirror , and allows one to elucidate such effects as optical bistability , optical spring effects , and radiation - induced cooling of the mechanical oscillators  @xcite .",
    "alternative experimental setups such as the membrane - in - the - middle geometry  @xcite , cold atoms in a cavity  @xcite , and photonic crystal structures  @xcite , facilitate the investigation of quadratic or higher - order optomechanical interactions  @xcite , and opens up the exploration of multimode optomechanics  @xcite .",
    "most experiments to date are carried out in a regime where the optomechanical coupling is weak compared to the mechanical frequency and the cavity linewidth , and can be treated as a perturbation .",
    "when the cavity is driven by a classical field , the optomechanical coupling in this regime can be linearized , resulting in effects such as beam splitter swapping and parametric amplification .",
    "this linearized optomechanical interaction also accounts e.g. for radiation - induced cooling or amplification  @xcite , normal - mode splitting  @xcite , and optomechanically induced transparency  @xcite .",
    "however , the linearized treatment needs to be revisited if the optomechanical interaction frequency becomes comparable to the frequency of harmonic trapping potential of the mechanics , in which case its intrinsic nonlinearity becomes of crucial importance even for cavity fields that only contain very few photons  @xcite . here",
    "the role of quantum fluctuations can become of central importance .",
    "the so realized nonlinear optomechanics promises the generation of non - gaussian states  @xcite , nonclassical mechanical steady - state  @xcite , and quantum state control and optical switching at a single photon level  @xcite .",
    "such a strong - coupling regime has not been realized in nano - fabricated optomechanical systems , but optomechanical systems involving ultracold atomic clouds  @xcite can currently operate in this regime .    in this paper , we study theoretically optomechanical interactions in the single - photon strong - coupling regime in which the optomechanical coupling is comparable to or stronger than the harmonic trapping potential of the mechanics , and cavity dissipation is the dominant source of damping . we first investigate the classical effective potential of the mechanical oscillators coupled to a single mode cavity field via a strong linear or quadratic coupling .",
    "the classical theory is used to elucidate selected examples that are then explored in the quantum theory .",
    "a quantum master equation is solved numerically to explore the dynamics of the mechanical oscillators and the effects of cavity fluctuations on the mechanics for the cases of one or two mechanical oscillators .",
    "we demonstrate that for linear coupling a single mechanical oscillator in the deep quantum regime does not exhibit the bistability that exists in the classical regime , a result that parallels the situation familiar from cavity qed  @xcite . in the quadratic coupling case the cavity fields leads to splitting and recombination dynamics of the spatial wave - functions of the oscillators , realizing a quantum interferometer .",
    "we also demonstrate the contribution of cavity fluctuations on the coherence of the mechanical system and propose a way to increase the lifetime of that coherence .    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii presents our basic model , introducing both linear and quadratic coupling of multimode mechanical systems to a single - mode optical field .",
    "section iii reviews how the adiabatic elimination of the optical field results in effective nonlinear dynamics for the mechanics and discusses its most important properties in the classical limit , concentrating of the form of the effective potential governing this dynamics for both linear and quadratic optomechanical couplings , and in the single - mode and two - mode cases .",
    "section iv addresses the extension of the treatment to the quantum regime and discusses the additional multiplicative quantum noise resulting from the elimination of the optical field .",
    "section v then presents a number of examples for one and two mechanical oscillators and explores how quantum fluctuations manifest themselves in interference , entanglement , and correlations in the quantum theory , while revealing the impact of decoherence of the mechanical system due to cavity fluctuations .",

    "the wave - packet splitting and subsequent recombination shown between @xmath133 $ ] in panel ( f ) of fig .  [ fig : ground_phase ] is reminiscent of a mach - zehnder interferometer .",
    "this suggests exploiting this system for observing quantum interferences , provided that decoherence remains manageable . to explore the relative contributions of the optical and mechanical damping to decoherence",
    "we now calculate the evolution of the mechanical mode initially prepared in a coherent superposition of wave packets localized at non - zero displacements @xmath134 with different relative phase @xmath135 @xmath136 and for two different values of the mechanical damping .",
    "the idea of this simulation is that the two components of the coherent superposition are representative of the wave - packet components resulting from the bifurcation - induced splitting at @xmath137 in panel ( f ) of fig .",

    "[ fig : cat ] for a cavity pumping rate beyond the bifurcation point .",
    "panel ( a ) is for @xmath138 and @xmath139 , while the subsequent panels are for @xmath140 and various values of @xmath135 .",
    "the bottom four panels show that for the case of negligible mechanical damping ( on the time scale of the plots ) the probability near zero displacement depends on the initial relative phase @xmath135 , a clear signature of a quantum interference effect .",
    "interferences reappear periodically for longer times , but with a slowly decreasing amplitude due to the decoherence resulting from the quantum fluctuations of the optical field .",
    "what is perhaps surprising is however that the interferences subsist for remarkably long times , thousands of cavity decay times @xmath141 . that quantum coherence can persist on such long time scales",
    "is attributed to the coherent pumping of the cavity mode .",
    "it is known , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite , that the coherent pumping of schrdinger cats can result in maintaining their coherence for arbitrarily long times . in the specific case of coherently driven micromasers for example",
    ", it was shown that the onset of these superpositions resembles a second - order phase transition , with the control parameter being the ratio of the atomic injection rate to the cavity damping rate .",
    "in contrast , panels ( a ) and ( b ) illustrate the effect intuitively expected from mechanical dissipation .",
    "all parameters are identical in these panels , except that @xmath142 in ( a ) and @xmath143 in ( b ) .",
    "as expected , the first interference peak visible in panel ( b ) is already significantly reduced in case ( a ) after a time of about @xmath144 , and all but extinguished after a time @xmath145 .",

    "we attribute the initial decay to the multiplicative nature of the noise due to cavity mode fluctuations appearing in the third term on the right - hand - side of eq .",

    "first , we observe that this term gives rise to fluctuations in the frequency experienced by the mechanical mode , and it is known that such frequency fluctuations can translate into an effective decay  @xcite .",
    "second , it has a resonant denominator that assumes its smallest value , and hence gives the largest loss , when the mechanical mode has a position in the vicinity of the minima of the double - well effective potential , whereas the loss will be relatively small when the oscillator is in the vicinity of @xmath70 . with reference to fig .  [",
    "fig : cat](b ) we see that between the first and second peaks , that occur at @xmath149 and @xmath150 , the probability density @xmath151 undergoes a transient and recurs close to the initial form @xmath152 , which is centered around the minima of the effective potential .",
    "thus there is sizable loss between the first two peaks .",
    "however , between subsequent pairs of neighboring peaks there is less of a recurrence , and the decay rate between peaks decreases with increasing time . eventually @xmath151 approaches a near steady - state and the loss rate becomes exponential .",
    "we remark that optical decoherence can also be reduced by using a pulsed rather than a continuous wave laser to excite the cavity , pulsed optomechanics having been previously studied in the context of squeezing of the position uncertainty of a mechanical oscillator @xcite .",
    "thus , using the bifurcation - induced wave - packet splitting followed by evolution of the subsequent wave packet in the harmonic potential of the mechanical mode offers a route to observing quantum interference effects alluded to here over times much longer than the optical decoherence time  but of course shorter than the inverse mechanical decay rate .",
    "this suggests that a single mode with quadratic optomechanical coupling , coherent driving and extremely slow mechanical damping is a viable candidate for producing quantum interference effects resulting from the bifurcation induced splitting .",
    "[ [ equal - couplings ] ] equal couplings + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we finally turn to the case of two mechanical modes with quadratic interactions , considering as in section [ classical ] both the cases of equal negative coupling coefficients and of coupling coefficients of equal magnitude but opposite sign . in the first case",

    "[ fig : opposite_signs_ground_state ] . not surprisingly , it is symmetric about both the lines @xmath159 and @xmath160 , and exhibits two peaks localized at the local minima of @xmath43 .",
    "physically this state corresponds to the oscillator `` 2 '' being in a `` cat state '' , whereas the oscillator `` 1 '' is a gaussian centered at the origin @xmath159 .",
    "the schmidt number for this ground state is found numerically to be equal to one , which implies that it is separable .",
    "figure  [ fig : quadratic_entropy ] shows the time evolution of the von neumann entropies of oscillators `` 1 '' ( orange dot - dashed line ) and `` 2 '' ( green dotted line ) , their joint entropy ( red dashed line ) , and mutual quantum information ( blue solid line ) .",
    "all entropies being initially equal to zero confirms that the ground state is separable , with both subsystems in pure states  @xcite . under the influence of quantum noise from both the optical field and the mechanics",
    "the entropy of the oscillators then increases , with oscillator `` 1 '' experiencing an entropy increase that is much slower than oscillator `` 2 '' .",
    ", this is not surprising , since due to its cat - like nature the second oscillator is expected to be much more sensitive to decoherence . eventually the increase in entropy of oscillator `` 2 '' reverses , and asymptotically the mechanics reaches a situation where entropy is distributed almost equally between the two oscillators . as was the case for linear optomechanical coupling ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : linear_entropy ] , the growth of their quantum mutual information ( blue solid line ) with time shows that the cavity fluctuations in fact correlate the two initially uncorrelated mechanical oscillators , that is , dissipation builds correlation via interaction of the two oscillators with a common light field or bath .",
    "the absence of mutual coherence between the two oscillators in the ground state begs the question of the extent to which the spatial coherence of oscillator 2  which is initially in a cat - like state associated with the double - well effective potential along axis @xmath55  survives in the presence of decoherence . to explore this we computed the time dependence of the marginal probability density @xmath161 ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : p2 ] .",
    "as expected the initial interference fringes wash out in the long term limit , but similarly to the case of a single oscillator , we find somewhat counterintuitively that the main source of decoherence is mechanical damping , despite the fact that the mechanical decay rates are three orders of magnitude slower than the cavity decay rate @xmath28 in that example .",
    "again , we attribute this result to the coherent driving of the optical field that reduces its effective decoherence rate .",
    "we also find that the localized wave functions oscillate around the local minima of the effective potential with a frequency @xmath162 the origin of these oscillations is the cavity fluctuations that act as a source of multiplicative noise on the mechanic , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ qforce ] ) .",
    "the cavity noise terms are multiplied with the position of the oscillator , and the oscillator thus favors to have small displacement .",
    "in summary , we have investigated a number of aspects of the quantum dynamics of multiple mechanical modes coupled to a single quantized cavity field mode via linear or quadratic optomechanical interactions in the single - photon strong coupling regime , where the single - photon optomechanical coupling coefficient is comparable to the mechanical frequency and the cavity decay rate @xmath28 is large enough that the optical field can be adiabatically eliminated . at the mean - field level the coherent part of the cavity field provides an effective potential for the mechanics , revealing mechanical bistability for the case of a single mode and linear interactions , and a sub - critical bifurcation and associated double - well potential for the case of quadratic interactions .",
    "in addition to sideband cooling effects that are not addressed in this paper , a number of aspects of the resulting nonlinear dynamics have been investigated in the past in the classical regime , for instance the radiation pressure induced bistability of the mechanics that was already demonstrated nearly 30 years ago  @xcite . a key finding here",
    "is that in the single - photon strong coupling regime of optomechanics , quantum noise changes the mean - field picture significantly , particularly since the noise component associated with the optical field is multiplicative .",
    "specifically , for a single mode and linear interactions we found the disappearance of mechanical bistability , reminiscent of the familiar cavity qed case , whereas for quadratic interactions we elucidated a quantum interference phenomenon based on bifurcation - induced wave - packet splitting . for the case of two mechanical modes and linear interactions",
    "we explored how an initial entangled state , taken as the quantum mechanical ground state of the effective potential , evolves in the presence of optical and mechanical decay , finding that the mutual quantum information can persist for long times due to the fact that the mechanical modes interact with a common cavity mode . similar persistence of quantum effects for times orders of magnitude longer than the short cavity decay time @xmath141 were also found for the case of quadratic interactions , which is a plus for the possibility of observing these effects .",
    "moreover , these results should serve as a cautionary tale and a warning against making superficial order of magnitude arguments to ignore the effects of mechanical damping rate @xmath163 for @xmath164 . coherent driving of one or the other system can change things dramatically , and particular care must be taken under such conditions .",
    "clearly , this paper has only scratched the surface of the wealth of dynamical effects that can take place in multimode optomechanical systems , both in the classical and the quantum regimes .",
    "for example , nonlinearities need not be associated with the interaction of mechanical modes with a common optical field , but can also result from a number of other coupling mechanics , such as perhaps interacting with the phonon bath of a common substrate , providing e.g. interesting options for band structure engineering .",
    "larger multimode systems also open interesting venues for the study of lattice systems , and multimode systems are also at the core of propagation studies , with interesting potential for quantum acoustics for example .",
    "this is an extremely rich area of investigation that we will continue to explore in forthcoming research .",
