    "these algebraic varieties are noncompact , indeed @xmath4 is affine , but they have compactifications .",

    "@xmath17 in @xmath9 ) and its image @xmath18 in @xmath19 .",
    "our basic question is to understand the relationship between @xmath20 ( resp .",
    "@xmath17 ) and @xmath18 . in what follows",
    "we concentrate on @xmath16 but there are also conjectures for @xmath17 as mentioned in @xcite , with recent results by collier and li @xcite",
    ".    the divisors at infinity in @xmath8 and @xmath9 are both the same .",
    "they are @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the complement of the nilpotent cone . recall that @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the hitchin fibration .",
    "hence @xmath20 ( and similarly @xmath17 ) may be identified as an equivalence class of points in @xmath25 modulo the action of @xmath26 .",
    "we may therefore write @xmath27 as a semistable higgs bundle , such that the higgs field @xmath28 is not nilpotent , and this identification holds up to nonzero complex scaling of @xmath28 .",
    "it turns out that the essential features of the correspondence with @xmath19 depend not on @xmath28 up to complex scaling , but up to real scaling .",
    "we therefore introduce the _ real blowing up _",

    "we may again write @xmath36 but this time @xmath28 is defined up to positive real scaling .",
    "we denote by @xmath0 the _ spectrum _ of @xmath28 .",
    "it consists of a multivalued tuple of holomorphic differential forms on @xmath3 .",

    ", it will be most useful to think of writing @xmath39 locally over @xmath3 , where @xmath40 are holomorphic differential forms .",
    "there will generally be some singularities at points over which @xmath41 is ramified , and as we move around in the complement of these singularities the order of the @xmath40 may change .",
    "denote by @xmath42 the complement of the set of singularities .",
    "gaiotto - moore - neitzke @xcite define the _ spectral network _ associated to @xmath0 .",
    "this is one of the main players in our story .",
    "we refer to @xcite for many pictures , and to our paper @xcite for some specific pictures related to the bnr example .",
    "these structures constitute our understanding of @xmath34 .    on the other side ,",
    "the point @xmath43 may be identified with an action of @xmath44 on an @xmath11-building @xmath45 .",
    "the theory of gromov - schoen and korevaar - schoen allows us to choose an equivariant harmonic mapping @xmath46 .",
    "this is most often uniquely determined by the action .",
    "the metric on the building , and hence the differential of the harmonic mapping , are well - defined up to positive real scaling .    here",
    ", we use the terminology `` harmonic map '' to an @xmath11-building to mean a map such that the domain , minus a singular set of real codimension @xmath47 , admits an open covering where each open set maps into a single apartment , and these local maps are harmonic mappings to euclidean space .",
    "the differential of a harmonic map is the real part of a mutlivalued differential form .",
    "in @xcite we used the groupoid version of parreau s theory @xcite to construct the harmonic mapping @xmath48 , and the classical local wkb approximation to show that its differential is @xmath0 .",
    "the differential of the harmonic mapping @xmath48 is the real part of the multivalued differential @xmath0 considered above : @xmath49    we note that collier and li have proven the corresponding result for the hitchin wkb problem in some cases @xcite .",
    "this theorem suggests the following question .",
    "[ mainq ] to what extent does @xmath0 determine @xmath48 and hence @xmath43 ?    in what follows we shall assume that we have passed to the universal cover of the riemann surface so @xmath50 .",
    "furthermore , since our considerations now , about how to integrate the differential @xmath0 into a harmonic map @xmath48 , concern mainly bounded regions of @xmath3 , we may envision other examples .",
    "such might originally have come from noncompact riemann surfaces and differential equations with irregular singularities .",
    "the bnr example in @xcite was of that form .",
    "a _ @xmath0-harmonic map _ will mean a harmonic map @xmath48 from @xmath3 to a building @xmath51 , such that its differential is @xmath52 .",
    "the goal of this paper is to sketch a theory which should lead to the answer to question [ mainq ] , at least for the group @xmath1 and under certain genericity hypotheses about the absence of `` bps states '' .",
    "we start by reviewing briefly the theory of harmonic maps to trees , viewed as buildings for @xmath2 , with the universal map given by the leaf space of a foliation defined by a quadratic differential . the remainder of the paper is devoted to generalizing this classical theory to higher rank buildings and in particular , as discussed in section [ twodb ] , to two - dimensional buildings for @xmath1 .    in order to go towards an algebraic viewpoint ,",
    "we indicate in section [ sec - presheaf ] how one can view a building as a presheaf on a certain grothendieck site of _ enclosures_. this allows one to formulate a small - object argument completing a pre - building to a building .    in section [ sec - initial ]",
    "we describe the initial construction associated to a spectral curve @xmath0 .",
    "this is the building - like object , admitting a @xmath0-harmonic map from @xmath3 , obtained by glueing together small local pieces .",
    "the initial construction will have points of positive curvature , and the main work is in sections [ sec - modifying ] and [ sec - progress ] where we describe a sequence of modifications to the initial construction designed to remove the positive curvature points .",
    "one of the main difficulties is that a point where only four @xmath53 sectors meet , admits in principle two different foldings .",
    "information coming from the original harmonic map serves to determine which of the two foldings should be used . in order to keep track of this information ,",
    "we introduce the notion of `` scaffolding '' .",
    "the result of sections [ sec - modifying ] and [ sec - progress ] is a sequence of moves leading to a sequence of two - manifold constructions .",
    "our main conjecture is that when the spectral network @xcite of @xmath0 does nt have any bps states , this sequence is well defined and converges locally to a two - manifold construction with only nonpositive curvature .",
    "the universal pre - building is obtained by putting back some pieces that were trimmed off during the procedure .    in section [ bnrrev ] , coming as an interlude between the two main sections , we present an extended example .",
    "we show how to treat the bnr example which we had already considered rather extensively in @xcite , but from the point of view of the general process being described here .",
    "it was through consideration of this example that we arrived at our process , and we hope that it will guide the reader to understanding how things work .    in section [ sec - a2 ] we present just a few pictures showing what can happen in a typical slightly more complicated example .",
    "this example and others will be considered more extensively elsewhere .    in section [ sec - further ]",
    "we consider some consequences of our still conjectural process , and indicate various directions for further study .",
    "this paper is intended to sketch a picture rather than provide complete proofs .",
    "all stated theorems , propositions and lemmas are actually `` quasi - theorems '' : plausible and tractable statements for which we have in mind a potential method of proof .",
    "statements which should be considered as open problems needing considerably more work to prove , are labeled as conjectures .",
    "the ideas presented here are part of our ongoing attempt to understand the geometric picture relating points in the hitchin base and stability conditions .",
    "so this work is initiated and motivated by the work of maxim kontsevich and yan soibelman , as exemplified by their many lectures and the discussions we have had with them .",
    "it is a great pleasure to dedicate this paper to maxim on the occasion of his @xmath54 birthday .",
    "the reader will note that many other mathematicians are also contributing to this fast - developing theory and we would also like to thank them for all of their input .",
    "we hope to present here a small contribution of our own .    on a somewhat more specific level , the idea of looking at harmonic maps to buildings , generalizing the leaf space tree of a foliation , came up during some fairly wide discussions about this developing theory in which fabian haiden also participated and made important comments , so we would like to thank fabian .",

    "let us first consider the case of representations into @xmath2 .",
    "exact wkb analysis and its relationship with the geometry of quadratic differentials has been considered extensively by iwaki and nakanishi @xcite .    in the morgan - shalen - parreau theory ,",
    "the limiting building @xmath45 is then an @xmath11-tree . in saying _",
    "@xmath11-tree _ we include the data of a distance function which is the standard one on any apartment .",
    "the choice of metric is well - defined up to a global scalar on @xmath45 .",
    "the spectral curve @xmath41 is a @xmath47-sheeted covering defined by a quadratic differential @xmath55 .",
    "the multivalued differential form @xmath0 is just the set of two square roots : @xmath56 .",
    "the singularities are the zeros of @xmath57 , and we shall usually assume that these are simple zeros .",
    "it corresponds to saying that @xmath58 is smooth which , for a @xmath47-sheeted cover , implies having simple branch points .",
    "@xmath59    the differential form @xmath60 is well defined up to a change of sign .",
    "therefore , it defines a single real direction at every nonsingular point of @xmath3 , which we call the _",
    "foliation direction_. these directions are the tangent directions to the leaves of a real foliation , which we call the _ foliation defined by @xmath0 _ or equivalently the _ foliation defined by the quadratic differential @xmath57_.    suppose @xmath61 is an @xmath11-tree and @xmath62 is a @xmath0-harmonic map",
    ". then , the closed leaves of the foliation defined by @xmath0 map to single points in @xmath61 .",
    "this is clear from the differential condition at smooth points . by continuity",
    "it also extends across the singularities : the closed leaves are defined to be the smallest closed subsets which are invariant by the foliation . in pictures , a leaf entering a three - fold singular point therefore generates two branches of the leaf going out in the other two directions , and all three of these branches have to map to the same point in @xmath61 .",
    "we assume that the _ space of leaves of the foliation _ is well - defined as an @xmath11-tree .",
    "denote it by @xmath63 .",
    "the points of @xmath64 are by definition just the closed leaves of the foliation .    in order to consider the universal property",
    ", we say that a _ folding map _",
    "@xmath65 is a map such that there is a locally finite decomposition of @xmath11 into segments , such that on each segment @xmath66 is an isometric embedding .",
    "a map @xmath67 between @xmath11-trees is a _ folding map _ if its restriction to each apartment is a folding map .",
    "note that an isometric embedding is a particularly nice kind of folding map which does nt actually fold anything .",
    "the projection map @xmath68 is a @xmath0-harmonic map , universal among @xmath0-harmonic maps to @xmath11-trees .",
    "that says that if @xmath69 is any other @xmath0-harmonic map , there exists a unique folding map @xmath70 making the diagram @xmath71 commute .    in general , we have to admit the possibility that @xmath72 be a folding map rather than an isometric embedding .",
    "let us look at an example which illustrates this .",
    "suppose that our quadratic differential or equivalently @xmath0 , has two singular points which are on the same leaf of the foliation .",
    "see figure [ foliation1 ] .",
    "the leaf segment between the two singularities is emphasized , it is called a _ bps - state _ @xcite .",
    "these play a key role in the wallcrossing story . here , it is the existence of the bps state which leads to nonrigidity of the harmonic map .",
    "the space of leaves of the foliation is a tree @xmath64 with four segments . in figure [ tree1 ]",
    "these segments are labeled in the same way as the corresponding regions in the previous picture of the foliation .",
    "@xmath73    suppose we have a @xmath0-harmonic map @xmath48 to another tree @xmath61 .",
    "the universal property gives a factorizing map @xmath74 .",
    "the map @xmath48 is supposed to send small open sets in @xmath42 to single apartments in @xmath61 .",
    "the small open sets in @xmath3 provide some small segments in the tree @xmath64 , and the segments in @xmath64 which are images of these neighborhoods , have to map by isometric embeddings ( i.e. not be folded ) under @xmath66 .",
    "little neighborhoods along the segments joining the regions for example @xmath75 to @xmath51 , @xmath51 to @xmath76 , @xmath76 to @xmath30 and @xmath30 to @xmath75 , as well as a neighborhood along the bps state , are shown in figure [ littlenbds ] .",
    "@xmath77    the four outer neighborhoods project to four corner segments as shown in figure [ cornersegs ] .",
    "@xmath78    therefore @xmath66 can not fold these segments .",
    "the little neighborhood along the central leaf projects to the segment shown in figure [ cseg ] joining the upper edge @xmath75 of the tree and the lower edge @xmath76 .",
    "@xmath79    it follows that @xmath66 is not allowed to fold the two segments @xmath75 and @xmath76 together .",
    "however , @xmath66 could very well fold the segments @xmath51 and @xmath30 together since they are not constrained by any neighborhoods in @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , we can have a harmonic , while locally harmonic , will not however be globally energy - minimizing . ] map to the tree @xmath61 shown in figure [ newtree ] .",
    "@xmath80    the central dot goes to the central dot , the segments @xmath75 and @xmath76 go to @xmath81 and @xmath82 , and the segments @xmath51 and @xmath30 go to the paths from the central dot out to @xmath83 and @xmath84 , which are folded together along some short segment .",
    "we see in this example that the projection to the leaf space of the foliation is not rigid , and this non - rigidity looks closely related to the presence of the bps state .    on the contrary",
    ", if there are no bps states , then @xmath85 is rigid :    [ treecase ] suppose that the spectral curve is smooth , i.e. the quadratic differential has simple zeros . if there are no bps states , then any @xmath0-harmonic map @xmath69 factors as @xmath86 through a unique map @xmath74 which is an isometric embedding",
    "thus , @xmath61 is just @xmath64 plus some other edges not touched by the image of @xmath48 .    in the situation of the theorem ,",
    "any two nonsingular points of @xmath3 are joined by a strictly noncritical path , that is to say a path transverse to the foliation .",
    "the distance between the two points in @xmath64 is the length of the path using the transverse measure defined by @xmath60 .",
    "this noncritical path also has to go to a noncritical path in @xmath61 , so the distance in @xmath61 is the same as in @xmath64 .",
    "if there is a bps state , then some distances might not be well - determined .",
    "for example the distance between points in regions @xmath51 an @xmath30 may change with the family of maps pictured in figure [ newtree ] .",
    "non - uniqueness of the distance is something that has to be expected from the point of view of the voros resurgent expression for the transport function @xcite .",
    "the resurgent expression may be viewed , roughly speaking , as a combination of contributions of different exponential orders @xmath87 .",
    "see @xcite for a more precise discussion of how this works .",
    "when there is a bps state , then two exponents have the same real part , @xmath88 .",
    "if these are the leading terms , then we obtain a function which becomes oscillatory along the positive real direction in @xmath89 .",
    "a simple example would be @xmath90 .",
    "if the transport function @xmath91 is oscillatory , then the asymptotic exponent @xmath92 could very well depend on the choice of ultrafilter @xmath14 used to define the limit .",
    "thus , when there is a bps state we can expect that the distance function defined by the harmonic map could depend on the choice of ultrafilter . in particular , it would nt be uniquely determined by the spectral differential @xmath0 .",
    "these considerations , fitting perfectly well with the illustration of figure [ newtree ] , motivate the hypothesis about bps states in theorem [ treecase ] .",
    "we feel that there should be a similar picture for higher - dimensional buildings .",
    "the basic philosophy and motivations were described in @xcite .",
    "our idea at the current stage of this project is to concentrate on mappings to @xmath47-dimensional buildings .",
    "these buildings are asymptotic cones for symmetric spaces @xmath93 , and the mappings are limiting points in the sense of parreau s theory @xcite @xcite .",
    "the spectral curves for such mappings are triple coverings @xmath41 .    for this @xmath1 case ,",
    "our goal is to sketch the outlines of a theory which should lead to a generalization of theorem [ treecase ] .",
    "it will say that for generic @xmath0 in a chamber where there are no bps states , there should be a versal map to a building , such that the resulting distance function is uniquely determined by @xmath0 and preserved under @xmath0-harmonic maps .",
    "the @xmath1 situation is in many ways an intermediate case . in the @xmath2 case ,",
    "the mapping @xmath85 to the tree @xmath63 was _",
    "surjective_. for @xmath94 with @xmath95 , the corresponding buildings have dimension @xmath96 , so the map from @xmath3 has no hope of being surjective .",
    "we will present some speculations about that higher rank situation at the end of the paper .    in the @xmath1 case ,",
    "the dimension of the building is two , which is the same as the dimension of @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , we can expect that @xmath3 will surject onto a subset which at least has nonempty interior .",
    "so , it presents some similarity with the case of trees , and this simplifies the geometrical aspects .",
    "we are able to develop a fairly precise although still conjectural picture",
    ".    the image of @xmath3 will be a quotient of @xmath3 , glueing together points over certain portions .",
    "this was seen in our bnr example of @xcite which shall be recalled in detail in section [ bnrrev ] below .",
    "our goal is to construct a map @xmath97 which should play the same role as the projection to the tree of leaves in the @xmath2 case .",
    "the construction has several steps .",
    "the main part will be the construction of a map to a _ pre - building _",
    "@xmath98 such that the building @xmath99 can then be obtained from @xmath100 by adding on sectors not touched by the image of @xmath3 . already in the bnr example of @xcite",
    "there were infinitely many additional sectors to be added here .",
    "they seem to be somewhat less related to the geometry of the situation .",
    "the pre - building will itself be a quotient of an _",
    "initial construction_. the initial construction is obtained by glueing together small pieces .",
    "recall that one of the main characteristics of a building is its nonpositive curvature property .",
    "the initial construction will , however , have some positively curved points : those are points where the total surrounding angle is @xmath101 rather than @xmath102 .",
    "as we shall see below , it leads to a process of successive pasting together of parts of the construction .",
    "we conjecture that after a locally finite number of steps this process should stop and give a pre - building .",
    "in order to get started , we need a precise way to manipulate the building - like objects involved in the construction . the idea for passing from @xmath100 to @xmath99 will be to apply the small object argument . also , the construction of @xmath100 itself will involve successively imposing a bigger and bigger relation on the initial construction .",
    "so , it appears that we are working with algebraic rather than topological or metric objects .",
    "this makes it desirable to have an algebraic framework .",
    "we propose to consider a _ grothendieck site _",
    "@xmath103 of the basic building blocks , called `` enclosures '' . then `` constructions '' will be sheaves of sets on the site @xmath103 , satisfying basic local presentability and separability properties .    intuitively , a construction is a space obtained by glueing together the basic pieces such as shown in figure [ someencs ] .",
    "proofs are not yet given , however we hope that they will be reasonably straightforward .",
    "the general theory is described for buildings of any dimension .",
    "let @xmath75 be the affine space on which our buildings will be modeled .",
    "a _ root half - space _ is a half - space bounded by a root hyperplane . an _",
    "enclosure _ is a bounded closed subset defined by the intersection of finitely many root half - spaces . for buildings corresponding to @xmath1 , the affine space is",

    "@xmath107 and some examples of enclosures are shown in figure [ someencs ] .",
    "@xmath108    an _ affine map _ of enclosures @xmath109 is a map which is the restriction of an automorphism of @xmath75 given by an affine weyl group element .",
    "let @xmath103 be the category of enclosures and affine maps between them .",
    "there is an object `` point '' denoted @xmath110 consisting of a single point in @xmath75 .",
    "we define a grothendieck topology on @xmath103 as follows : a covering of @xmath111 is a finite collection of affine maps of enclosures @xmath112 such that @xmath111 is the union of their images .",
    "the category @xmath103 admits fiber products , but not products and in particular there is no terminal object .",
    "the coverings define a grothendieck topology on @xmath103 .    if @xmath111 is an enclosure , we denote by @xmath113 the sheaf associated to the presheaf represented by @xmath111 .",
    "it is different from the presheaf : if @xmath114 is another enclosure , then the sections of @xmath113 over @xmath114 , which is to say the maps @xmath115 or equivalently the maps @xmath116 , are the _ folding maps _ from @xmath114 to @xmath111 .",
    "these are the continuous maps which are piecewise affine for a decomposition of @xmath114 into finitely many pieces which are themselves enclosures",
    ".    we can give a normalized form for coverings .",

    "then we obtain a sequence of _ strips _",
    "@xmath118 covering @xmath75 .",
    "the strip @xmath119 is the closed subset consisting of everything between and including @xmath120 and @xmath121 , with @xmath122 and @xmath123 being the two outer half - planes ( we assume @xmath124 so there is no question about the ordering of these ) .",
    "the strip @xmath125 is just @xmath126 itself .",
    "suppose we are given a collection of such sequences of strips @xmath127 for various directions of the weyl hyperplanes .",

    "then it may be refined to a _ standard covering _ , that is to say a covering of the form @xmath132 constructed above .",
    "we remark that in a standard covering @xmath133 , the intersections of elements are again elements , since intersections of strips are included as strips too ( that was why we included the @xmath120 themselves )",

    "if @xmath474 has no fourfold points , we would like to say that @xmath498 is the pre - building ; however , in putting back in the pushouts with standard parallelograms , we might be introducing new fourfold points .",

    "in order to illustrate the procedure described above , we show how it works in the bnr example from @xcite .",
    "it was by considering this example in a new way that we came upon the above procedure .",
    "recall the picture from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 3 ) of the spectral network containing two singular points @xmath505 . at each singularity , there are two spectral network lines which meet lines from the opposite singularity , and the resulting four segments delimit a diamond - shaped zone in the middle of the picture . there is a single caustic @xmath76 joining @xmath506 to @xmath507 across the middle of this region .",

    "there are two additional sectors , forming a link across the middle of the octagon .",
    "the image of the middle region goes into these sectors but is not surjective due to the folding along the caustic , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 4 ) .",
    "we now illustrate how this end picture comes about using the process described above .",
    "the first step is to create the initial construction . for this , let us cover the caustic by some regions as illustrated in figure [ caustic - regions ] .",
    "the regions which cover the caustic are the ones which are bounded by the two foliation lines going from @xmath509 to @xmath510 , resp .",
    "@xmath511 to @xmath512 , resp .",
    "@xmath513 to @xmath514 .",
    "the first and last ones include the singularities @xmath506 and @xmath507 .",
    "each of these regions is folded under any @xmath0-harmonic map .",
    "they are in fact @xmath325 regions ( except at the two endpoints ) . the image of the regions from figure [ caustic - regions ] under the integration map to an apartment ,",
    "are shown in figure [ regions - image ] .",
    "the enclosures corresponding to these folded pieces are sketched into the picture completing the shaded regions to full parallelograms .",
    "the initial construction @xmath388 consists of glueing together these enclosures covering the caustics , and then adding enclosures around the remaining points which are not for the moment glued together .",
    "the illustration of figure [ regions - image ] may be viewed as a picture of @xmath388 , where the non - shaded regions of the curve correspond to two different sheets , an upper and a lower one corresponding to the upper and lower regions in figure [ caustic - regions ] .",
    "the completions of parallelograms just below the caustic are part of the initial construction @xmath388 ( these pieces should be considered as shaded having only one sheet ) but they are not images of points in @xmath3 .",
    "the zone below the dashed line is empty , that is to say it does nt correspond to any points in @xmath388 , in figure [ regions - image ] and similarly for the subsequent ones .",
    "now @xmath388 may be trimmed by taking out the regions containing folded pieces , leaving @xmath431 as shown in figure [ trimmed ] .",
    "again there are two sheets , which are joined together along the edge from @xmath506 to @xmath507 ( and also along the rays pointing outward from @xmath506 and @xmath507 ) . in this case",
    "the edge where the two sheets are joined corresponds to the dotted line , and as said above , the zone below the dotted line is empty .",
    "in @xmath431 we have five points @xmath515 which are not hexagonal .",
    "the points @xmath516 are eightfold whereas @xmath517 are fourfold points .",
    "the segments @xmath518 and @xmath519 are marked `` open '' , due to the trivalent edges in the constructions which are placed at the singularities . indeed , on the outer side of @xmath506 one gets an open edge , because we are in the image of a neighborhood in @xmath184 as was illustrated in figures [ littlenbds ] and [ cornersegs ] .",
    "this open edge then propagates into the segment @xmath518 by lemma [ straightcoh ] , because in @xmath431 all the points along this edge are hexagonal , including @xmath506 , and up to ( but not including ) @xmath509 .",
    "the segment is straight because on either side we are in the image of neighborhoods from @xmath3 .",
    "we may now show that the four segments @xmath520 , @xmath521 , @xmath522 and @xmath523 are marked `` fold '' .",
    "consider for example the fourfold point @xmath392 .",
    "let @xmath524 and @xmath525 be the points which complete the two parallelograms spanned by @xmath526 .",
    "the four sectors around @xmath392 are @xmath527 , @xmath528 , @xmath529 and @xmath530 .",
    "suppose we are given a map @xmath433 to a building , coming from a @xmath0-harmonic map @xmath328 .",
    "the two sectors @xmath527 and @xmath529 come from two adjacent sectors at a point in @xmath3 ( one of the lifts of the point @xmath392 ) .",
    "since the map @xmath48 does nt fold anything in @xmath351 , we conclude that there is no folding along the edge @xmath531 . similarly for @xmath532 .",
    "but since there are no cycles of length @xmath211 in the local spherical buildings of @xmath51 , the four sectors have to be collapsed somehow . therefore , our map must fold along the segments @xmath533 and @xmath521 .",
    "the same argument at @xmath393 shows that the map must fold along @xmath534 and @xmath523 .",
    "therefore the four segments @xmath520 , @xmath521 , @xmath522 and @xmath523 are marked `` fold '' .",
    "all other edges of @xmath431 correspond to edges in @xmath3 , so we conclude that all edges except for these four are marked `` open '' .",
    "we may now look at how the pasting - together process works .",
    "the first step is to paste together the two parallelograms @xmath535 and @xmath536 .",
    "similarly we paste together @xmath537 and @xmath538 .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ nextpaste ] .",
    "[ nextpaste ]     [ nexttrim ]    then we can cut out the parallelograms obtained from the above pasting .",
    "this gives the picture shown in figure [ nexttrim ] which is again a two - manifold construction @xmath539 .",
    "as before there are two sheets joined along the edge .",
    "now there is one remaining fourfold point at @xmath511 ( notice that what was previously an eightfold point has now become a fourfold point ) .",
    "denote by @xmath524 and @xmath540 the images in @xmath539 of the pairs of points @xmath541 and @xmath542 respectively . by the same reasoning as before , the segments @xmath543 and @xmath544 are marked `` fold '' whereas all the other edges are marked `` open '' .",
    "the next and last step of the pasting - together process is to paste together the two parallelograms @xmath545 and @xmath546 where @xmath547 and @xmath548 are the two collision points from @xmath3 .",
    "this gives figure [ lastpaste ] .",
    "[ lastpaste ]     [ lasttrim ]    cutting out the parallelogram obtained from the pasting - together , gives the two - manifold construction @xmath549 shown in figure [ lasttrim ] .",
    "it has only a single eightfold point at the image of the two collision points which are now identified .",
    "there are no fourfold points .",
    "therefore we may back up and add back in all of the parallelograms which were removed by the cutting - out processes .",
    "this gives the picture shown in figure [ bnrpb ] which is the universal pre - building accepting a map from @xmath3 .",
    "here as before , the unshaded regions above and to the left correspond to two sheets ; the shaded regions as well as the remaining pieces of the parallelograms just next to the dotted line , are single sheets , and everything below the dotted line is empty .",
    "[ bnrpb ]    when we turn this into a building using the small object argument , we get back the universal building constructed in @xcite .",
    "this was a first illustration of how the reduction process introduced in section [ sec - reduction ] leads to a universal pre - building . in the next section",
    "we discuss some further aspects of the process in the general case .",
    "in general we have the following setup : starting with @xmath495 we first make the initial construction @xmath388 , then trim it to get a two - manifold construction @xmath431 .",
    "then we go through a sequence of steps of pasting - together then cutting - out described in section [ sec - reduction ] .",
    "this yields a sequence of two - manifold constructions @xmath550 ( these were denoted @xmath469 in section [ sec - modifying ] but we change to the notation @xmath550 here in order to think of them as modifications of the original surface @xmath388 ) .",
    "the construction @xmath431 has a coherent full scaffolding by lemma [ initialscaff ] . in order to proceed with the construction at each step",
    ", we would like to know that after each operation the new @xmath550 may still be given a uniquely defined full coherent scaffolding , which is hypothesis [ reductionhyp ] .",
    "if this hypothesis holds at each stage , then we can continue the operation and hope that it converges locally at least . in this section",
    "we explain some ideas for how to understand more precisely the sequence of constructions , and how to see hypothesis [ reductionhyp ] saying that full scaffoldings will be determined at each step , if there are no bps states .",
    "let us first axiomatize some properties of our two - manifold constructions and their scaffoldings .",
    "our two - manifold constructions @xmath550 are provided with scaffoldings in which almost all of the edges are marked `` open '' or @xmath551 .",
    "those vertices in the local spherical buildings which are marked `` fold '' or @xmath305 , are parts of straight edges ( that is , edges such that at each point , at least one side of the edge has both directions transverse to that edge , marked @xmath551 ) .",
    "the marking is the same along the straight edge .    *",
    "fourfold points* we require that , at any fourfold point there should be two opposite edges marked @xmath551 , and two opposite edges marked @xmath305 :    @xmath552    the configuration with all four edges folded is admissible from the point of view of coherence , but throughout our procedure we conjecture that it should not occur .    * hexagonal points* at a hexagonal point , the possibilities are as follows .",
    "first , either all edges are open or two opposite edges are folded .",
    "@xmath553    @xmath554    it is also possible to have three @xmath551 and three @xmath305 alternating ; this configuration should actually be considered as a superposition of a @xmath555 point plus an @xmath556 point starting a new postcaustic curve . furthermore , one additional edge can also be folded .",
    "@xmath557    @xmath558    finally , a hexagonal point can have all edges folded .",
    "again , we conjecture that this does nt appear in our procedure .    *",
    "eightfold points* at an eightfold point , there are the following main possibilities .",
    "first , a bnr point with all edges open .",
    "then , a point with a single fold line , as happens at the end of a postcaustic curve , initially coming from a singularity .",
    "@xmath559    @xmath560    there are two ways of having a post - caustic pass through the eightfold point , either two opposite fold lines , as is most standard ; or two adjacent fold lines , .",
    "@xmath561    @xmath562    notice that when the two adjacent fold lines get folded up , the image is a hexagon , with one sector covered three times by passing over and back .",
    "this picture with two adjacent fold lines comes up , in particular , in the initial construction when we have a crossing of two caustic lines .",
    "it can also arise sometime later in the procedure .",
    "_ other eightfold points_several other configurations are also admissible from the point of view of coherence , although we feel that they probably will not occur in the procedure .",
    "it is left to the reader to enumerate these .",
    "this finishes the description of the expected properties of open and fold markings of our scaffolding .",
    "the set of possible local pictures listed above covers the situations which we meet along the various steps of the process .",
    "a scaffolding of a two - manifold construction will be called _",
    "admissible _ if its local pictures are in the above list ( completed as per the preceding paragraph ) .",
    "if @xmath550 is a two - manifold construction with a full coherent scaffolding , then the scaffolding is admissible .    in the two - manifold construction obtained by trimming the initial construction , and then in the two - manifold constructions which are met along the way of our process ( assuming that there are no bps states and hypothesis [ reductionhyp ] holds ) , the full coherent scaffolding is always admissible .",
    "it is a consequence of the above list of local pictures allowed for an admissible scaffolding , that the collection of points which have an edge marked `` fold '' in the scaffolding is organized into a collection of piecewise linear curves marked as folded edges .",
    "furthermore , it follows that the endpoints of the curves are @xmath556 points ( or @xmath563 triple points ) , and along a curve the successive segments have endpoints which alternate as @xmath564 .",
    "all points outside of these are hexagonal i.e. flat .",
    "call these curves `` post - caustic '' curves , because they arise in the initial construction as approximations to the caustics .",
    "we may think of @xmath550 as a locally flat surface but with singularities : positive curvature at the @xmath555 points ( total angle @xmath101 ) and negative curvature ( total angle @xmath508 ) at the @xmath556 points .",
    "the total curvature of a post - caustic curve is equivalent to one @xmath556 vertex .",
    "the next step is to start trying to remove the fourfold points by using the pasting - together construction of section [ sec - pasting ] .",
    "suppose we have gotten to a two - manifold construction @xmath550 .    at a fourfold point",
    "we choose a standard pair of parallelograms to be glued together .",
    "it may be seen from the @xmath325 argument that the two parallelograms must go to the same place in any harmonic map to a building . here , by a standard parallelogram we mean one in which all of the interior edges , including interior edges along the sides , are labeled as open .",
    "thus in a map to a building the paths which look noncritical , must actually map to noncritical paths .",
    "this applies in particular to the two outer edges which are common to both parallelograms .",
    "they form a noncritical path joining the two endpoints of the parallelograms @xmath110 and @xmath57 , and the @xmath325 argument works as usual .",
    "both parallelograms are swept out by noncritical paths so the two images in any map to a building must be identified .",
    "let @xmath565 denote the result of pasting together the two parallelograms .",
    "the next two - manifold construction @xmath566 is then obtained by cutting out the resulting parallelogram from @xmath565 .",
    "denote by the `` common edges '' of the parallelograms the two edges which are common and which start from the fourfold point ; the `` glued edges '' are the other two edges of each parallelogram .",
    "we assume that at least one of the two edge lengths of the parallelogram is maximal .",
    "it means that a non - hexagonal point , or possibly a hexagonal point with nontrivial marking , was encountered along some glued edge of at least one of the parallelograms .    in the new two - manifold construction @xmath566 , the only edges which do nt benefit from the previous scaffolding are the two glued edges",
    "therefore , the main problem is how to determine the new marking along these edges .",
    "we illustrate this in the next section .",
    "let us consider an example of pasting with a singularity on the edge .",
    "we draw this in figure [ pasting ] .",
    "the two parallelograms to be pasted together are @xmath567 and @xmath568 .",
    "they share two common edges , @xmath569 and @xmath570 .",
    "these edges come together at a fourfold point @xmath75 , and the other two edges at @xmath75 are marked `` open '' , so the edges @xmath569 and @xmath570 are marked `` fold '' ; hence they have been drawn as thick lines .",
    "the interior edges of both parallelograms are all marked `` open '' , in particular the four sides of each one are straight .",
    "thus , the two parallelograms must be mapped to the same place under any harmonic map to a building , and we will paste them together and cut them out .",
    "pasting together identifies the points @xmath51 and @xmath83 , we denote the image just by @xmath51 too . after cutting out the parallelogram we get a new two - manifold shown in figure [ newtwo ]    @xmath571 [ pasting ]    @xmath572 [ newtwo ]",
    "the eightfold point @xmath301 lies on the edge @xmath573 of the first parallelogram , this is constraining the width of the parallelogram to be maximal .",
    "let @xmath574 denote the corresponding point on the other parallelogram ; we are assuming that @xmath574 is a regular hexagonal point .",
    "now @xmath301 and @xmath574 are also identified in the new two - manifold and we let their image be called @xmath301 too .    in the picture we have drawn , we are assuming that @xmath575 and @xmath576 are hexagonal points and the folded edges @xmath569 and @xmath570 extend beyond the points @xmath575 and @xmath576 respectively . in the new two - manifold , @xmath575 and @xmath576",
    "are fourfold points , from which it follows that the edges @xmath577 and @xmath578 are folded .    *",
    "main question : * what is the marking of the edge @xmath579 ?",
    "let us look in the spherical construction at the point @xmath301 .",
    "at @xmath574 we have a hexagon with all directions marked `` open '' , whereas at the original point @xmath301 we are assuming there is an eightfold point .",
    "the two directions which are interior to the parallelogram are marked `` open '' by the hypothesis that the parallelogram is standard .",
    "we may picture the original point @xmath301 as follows , with the edges going towards @xmath575 and @xmath51 marked @xmath110 and @xmath249 respectively .",
    "@xmath580    notice that the edge @xmath110 should be marked `` open '' otherwise we would have a non - admissible configuration at @xmath575 .",
    "there are several different possibilities for the labels @xmath581 as well as that of @xmath249 , as will be discussed shortly .",
    "at the new point @xmath301 , the three interior sectors have been replaced by the three sectors which were exterior to the parallelogram at the point @xmath574 .",
    "the two directions inside here are again marked `` open '' because of our hypothesis that @xmath574 was a flat hexagonal point .",
    "we are left with a diagram of the following form :    @xmath582 the direction @xmath110 is now marked `` fold '' as discussed previously .",
    "[ sampledet ] in the above situation , the markings of @xmath583 , @xmath584 and @xmath585 determine the marking of @xmath249 .",
    "since @xmath110 is marked `` fold '' , it has to be folded leading to a hexagonal point .",
    "the edge germs to the left and right of @xmath110 are joined together into a single one marked @xmath586 below , and we do nt know how that one will be further folded .",
    "the hexagon may be pictured as : @xmath587 if @xmath583 , @xmath584 and @xmath585 are open , then it follows that the full hexagon must be open .",
    "if either @xmath583 or @xmath585 is folded , then from the given open edge we can not have a triple fold , so the opposite edge must also be folded .",
    "if @xmath583 is folded then it follows that @xmath249 must be folded .",
    "if @xmath585 is folded then @xmath586 must be folded .",
    "the hexagon then folds to a germ of half - apartment ; and one can see @xmath249 would be folded if and only if @xmath584 is folded . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath584 is folded , then since the edge opposite to it is open , it follows that @xmath586 and @xmath249 must be folded .",
    "this completes the determination of the marking of @xmath249 .",
    "of course this lemma treats just one of the various possible situations which can arise .",
    "we expect that similar considerations should hold in the other cases .    in our example",
    ", since the edge @xmath579 is straight , the marking of @xmath249 propagates along the full edge and we conclude that the marking of @xmath579 is determined ; for our example , that completes the determination of the full scaffolding on the new two - manifold .    by coherence",
    "one sees that there were only a few possibilities for the folded edges at @xmath301 , and the reader may find it interesting to study what happens to the post - caustic curves in these cases .",
    "suppose for example that the marking of @xmath249 determined by the lemma is `` open '' .",
    "the possibilities for @xmath301 are : a bnr point with no folding ; a single folded edge @xmath588 ; two opposite folded edges @xmath588 and @xmath249 ; or two adjacent folded edges @xmath585 and @xmath249 . in the latter two cases ,",
    "the edge @xmath589 was folded in the original construction , and this fold must continue past @xmath51 . in the new construction , the edge @xmath589 is no longer folded but the part of the post - caustic after @xmath51 will still be present . therefore , at the point @xmath51 in the new construction we obtain two adjacent folded edges , this continuation together with the new fold along @xmath590 .",
    "also in these two cases , at the new point @xmath301 we have two folded edges , @xmath110 and either @xmath588 ( adjacent ) or @xmath585 ( opposite ) .",
    "the new post - caustic coming from the point @xmath575 thus attaches onto the piece of post - caustic that used to come from one side of @xmath51 , whereas the old post - caustic on the other side of @xmath51 is now attached to the piece going through @xmath576 .      in a less generic situation , the new marking might not be well determined .",
    "consider a picture similar to the previous one , but where the post - caustic bounding the parallelogram ends at an eightfold point @xmath575 as shown in figure [ pasting2 ] .",
    "@xmath591 [ pasting2 ]    @xmath592 [ newtwo2 ]    now when we paste and cut out , the picture is in figure [ newtwo2 ] , noting specially that the edge @xmath578 is now open .",
    "the argument used to conclude that @xmath579 should be open , is no longer valid and we do nt know how to mark @xmath579 ( however that might be determined for some configurations of the markings of @xmath249 and the @xmath581 ) .",
    "it corresponds to a bps state : the eightfold point @xmath575 lies on a spectral network curve going in the upward direction , whereas in the cases where the markings of @xmath581 do nt tell us what to do for @xmath249 , the point @xmath301 is also on a spectral network curve .",
    "these two spectral network curves meet head - on along the segment @xmath578 and we get a bps state .",
    "one can also see that the resulting pre - building can admit folding maps to other buildings . here",
    "two eightfold points are connected by an edge ( which is not marked `` open '' ) .",
    "this is the first and most basic example where can be a nontrivial choice of maps to buildings , some of which fold and hence do not preserve distances .",
    "such a two - manifold construction , which we denote now by @xmath76 , is analogous to the tree with a bps state of figure [ tree1 ] .",
    "@xmath593 in this picture there are two sheets below the three edges , and no sheets above .",
    "the two eightfold points @xmath594 and @xmath595 are joined by an edge which we have emphasized ; it corresponds to a bps state .",
    "this construction @xmath76 is itself a pre - building , so it can be completed to a building @xmath596 containing it isometrically as a subset .",
    "however , it also admits a map to another construction , folding along the edge @xmath597 . to see this , choose two trapezoids sharing the edge @xmath597 , and paste them together .",
    "@xmath598    view this as a single sheet over the trapezoid and two sheets below .",

    "our main conjecture is that if there are no bps states , then an indeterminate case does nt occur . in order to set up the possibility to consider bps states",
    ", we will need to pull along the spectral network ( sn ) lines in the process of our sequence of @xmath550 .",
    "let us consider the sn lines on the @xmath550 as being additional markings , which should conjecturally be subject to the following conditions .",
    "* some points will be marked as singularities .",
    "* each singularity will have a single sn line coming out of it . *",
    "each eightfold point which is at the end of a postcaustic , that is to say , having a single fold line , will have a single sn coming out of it .",

    "the eightfold points with two fold lines do nt have sn lines .",
    "* the sn lines should not intersect . *",
    "the sn lines , in the middle , go through regular hexagonal points and they are straight .",
    "the steps of our process consist of pasting together two parallelograms and cutting them out .",
    "the two edges which are common to the two parallelograms are fold lines , meeting in a fourfold point .",
    "we choose parallelograms which have singular points somewhere on the boundary .",
    "each move will either decrease the total length of the postcaustics i.e. the fold lines , or diminish the number of fourfold points . in the case of integer edgelengths",
    "this would prove the finiteness conjecture .",
    "in general we need some other argument .",
    "one of the basic moves , when applied to the first fourfold point along a postcaustic , will glue together some new open edges . in the case that the sn curve was opposite the fold line ,",
    "the new glued edges are added to the sn curve , this way we build out the sn curve . in the adjacent case , on the contrary",
    ", the sn curve gets eaten up .",
    "one thing that can happen here is that as the sn curve gets eaten up , we can end up passing the singularity .",
    "then it changes to the other `` opposite '' case and we start spinning out the sn curve in the opposite direction .",
    "this is why all the sn directions at a singular point can actually have the opportunity to contribute .",
    "the main problem is to analyze the transformations of this picture which can occur when the various types of singularities occur on the boundary of our parallelogram .",
    "the markings @xmath551 or @xmath305 of the new edges glued in after we cut out the two parallelograms , are mostly determined ; however , because of the singularity there is one segment where it is nt determined .",
    "this was illustrated in the previous subsection .    at least in a first stage , we will probably also want to assume some genericity of the positions of the singularities so that we do nt reach several singularities on the boundary at once .    the basic idea is to say that if we reach a position where the new markings @xmath551 or @xmath305 of the indeterminate edge are not well determined by the configuration , then it must be that we had two sn curves which join up , and these form a bps state .",
    "this phenomenon was illustrated in the example of figures [ pasting2 ] and [ newtwo2 ] .",
    "it is possible to envision finishing the process with no more fourfold points , but still having a segment marked `` fold '' joining two eightfold points . in this case , the pre - building is not rigid and there might be several harmonic mappings inducing different distance functions .",
    "we are conjecturing that this can only occur if there is a bps state , indeed the fold line between eightfold points should correspond to a piece of the bps state .",
    "understanding all of the possible cases currently looks complicated , but we hope that it can be done .",
    "we formulate the resulting statement as a conjecture .",
    "[ mainconj ] suppose that @xmath495 has no bps states .",
    "then the sequence of two - manifold constructions @xmath550 is well - defined until we get to one which has no more fourfold points , or sixfold points with triple fold lines .",
    "furthermore , this process stops in finite time , at least locally on @xmath3 .",
    "finally , at the end of the process there are no more `` fold '' markings in the scaffolding .    associated with this",
    "is a finiteness conjecture .",
    "[ finitenessconj ] on bounded regions the process stabilizes in finitely many steps .",
    "these conjectures say that the series of two - manifold constructions will stabilize to a nonpositively curved one which can be called the _ core_. it plays a role analogous to stallings core graphs @xcite . starting from the core",
    "we can then put back everything that had been trimmed off , following the discussion in section [ sec - recovering ] , to get a pre - building .",
    "[ prebldg ] if there are no bps states , then on a bounded region we obtain a well - defined pre - building @xmath504 .",
    "it has a @xmath0-harmonic map @xmath603 such that if @xmath328 is any @xmath0-harmonic map to a building , then there exists a unique factorization through a non - folding map @xmath604 .",
    "one of the main statements which we would like to obtain through this theory is that the factorization from the pre - building is an isometric embedding .",
    "recall that the _ finsler distance _ is defined on an apartment @xmath75 with coordinates @xmath605 subject to @xmath105 , by @xmath606 it is not symmetric , and indeed the two numbers @xmath607 and @xmath608 serve to define the _ vector distance _ which is the series of numbers @xmath609 arranged in nonincreasing order .",
    "[ isoemb ] in the situation of corollary [ prebldg ] , given a @xmath0-harmonic map @xmath328 to a building , the factorization @xmath610 is an isometric embedding for the finsler distance .    to approach this statement ,",

    "suppose @xmath134 is a construction provided with scaffolding , and suppose @xmath219 is a straight segment joining its two endpoints @xmath184 and @xmath274 .",

    "say that @xmath134 is _ finsler nonconcave _ if there is no segment or point at which it is finsler concave .",
    "the idea to show conjecture [ isoemb ] would be to do the following steps .    * the finsler ( or vector ) distance between points in a ( pre)building is calculated by adding up the distances along a noncritical path .",
    "* if @xmath616 is a construction with scaffolding and @xmath309 is a compatible map to a building , then the image of a noncritical path in @xmath134 is a noncritical path in @xmath51 with the same finsler length . * in a connected construction with fully open scaffolding , which is finsler nonconcave , any two points are joined by a noncritical path .",
    "* when there are no bps states and assuming the previous conjectures , the pre - building @xmath504 is finsler nonconcave .",
    "it should be possible to check these properties for any given example .",
    "we close this section by mentioning an important aspect . under the pasting - together process",
    ", we glue together two parallelograms which are originally joined along two edges .",
    "the two parallelograms are supposed to be disjoint except for sharing these two edges .",
    "we need to choose a maximal such situation . in particular ,",
    "when increasing the size of the parallelogram up to its maximal value ( determined by when we meet some kinds of singularities along the boundary ) we would like to make sure that we do nt suddenly hit two points which are already previously identified .",
    "this is insured using an isoperimetric argument .",
    "namely , suppose we have pasted together the parallelograms just up to a point right before the extra joined points .",
    "cut out this pasted parallelogram , leaving as usual a two - manifold construction .",
    "the eightfold point from the vertex of the pasted parallelogram , is very near to a pair of points on the two sheets which are already identified .",
    "this gives a very short loop in our two - manifold construction ( by very short here , it means arbitrarily short depending on how close we got to the already - joined points ) .    by hypothesis ,",
    "our riemann surface @xmath3 is simply connected ( if we started with an original problem on a non - simply connected surface the first step would have been to pass to the universal cover ) .",
    "it follows that the successive two - manifold constructions @xmath550 are also simply connected .",
    "so , we are now at a simply connected two - manifold construction which has a very short loop .",
    "this loop cuts the surface into two pieces , at least one of which is a disk .",
    "we claim that this is impossible . to see that ,",
    "notice that since we are going arbitrarily close to the joined - together point , there are only two possible ways for a post - caustic curve of fold lines to pass from outside the disk to inside the disk : either through the eightfold vertex of the pasted parallelogram , or through the joined - together point . from this maximum of two",
    "post - caustics passing through the boundary of the disk , and using the fact that along any post - caustic the singular points alternate eightfold and fourfold points starting with eightfold points at the endpoints , we count that the difference @xmath617 is at most @xmath199 .",
    "it follows that the total angle deficit due to the curvature inside the disk is at most @xmath353 of positive curvature ( whereas an arbitrary amount of negative curvature ) .",
    "therefore the isoperimetric inequality for this disk can not be worse than that of a single fourfold point , where a small boundary implies that the disk is small itself . we get a contradiction to the arbitrarily small nature of our loop .",
    "this completes the proof that any two parallelograms to be pasted together through our process , are joined solely on the two edges coming out of the fourfold point .",
    "we include a few pictures concerning the next class of examples after bnr .",
    "it illustrates the phenomenon of crossing of caustics , and there are angular rotations leading to a bps state . because of space considerations we do nt have room for a full analysis here , that will be done elsewhere .",
    "the spectral network for this example is shown in figure [ a2sn ] .",
    "note that there are two caustics intersecting in the middle .",
    "the associated two - manifold construction is , in this case , the same as the pre - building .",

    "the bps states occur when the line segment @xmath624 goes in the direction of one of the reflection hyperplanes .",
    "we are then in the situation that was considered above in subsection [ sec - indeterminate ] .",
    "in this section we look at some consequences and other further considerations .",
    "as pointed out in corollary [ prebldg ] , the process conjectured above leads to the construction of a map to a pre - building @xmath625 in the absence of bps states , it will have a strong universal property : if @xmath328 is any @xmath0-harmonic map to a building , then there is a unique factorization @xmath626 which is an isometric embedding .",
    "conjectures [ mainconj ] and [ finitenessconj ] , when there are no bps states , imply that we can construct the pre - building without necessarily following through the whole procedure . indeed , if we can illustrate some pre - building @xmath83 with a @xmath0-harmonic map @xmath627 , such that some choice of the initial construction surjects onto @xmath83 , then @xmath628 .",
    "for example , this shows that the picture given figure [ a2pb ] of section [ sec - a2 ] does indeed show the pre - building for the a2 example .        for any wkb problem with spectral curve corresponding to @xmath0 , the ultrafilter exponent @xmath629 for the transport from a point @xmath575 to a point @xmath576 ,",
    "must be equal to the finsler distance in @xmath504 from @xmath630 to @xmath631 .",
    "in particular , it does nt depend on the choice of ultrafilter , which implies that the limit used to define the wkb exponent exists and its value is calculated as the finsler distance in @xmath504 .    even before obtaining general proofs of all of the conjectures which go into this statement , it should be possible to verify the required things when we are given a particular example of a spectral differential @xmath0 , thus obtaining a calculation of the wkb exponents .              in the works of bridgeland and smith @xcite and haiden , katzarkov and kontsevich @xcite ,",
    "a picture is developed whereby each pair @xmath495 consisting of a compact riemann surface and a twofold spectral covering , corresponds to a bridgeland stability condition on a fukaya - type triangulated category .",
    "the space of @xmath495 is divided up into chambers whose boundaries are walls determined by the existence of bps states",
    ". a stability condition corresponding to @xmath495 should really be thought of as associated to the circle of @xmath632 , and the values of @xmath633 where bps states arise are the angles of the central charge for stable objects .",
    "this chamber and wall structure is expected to be closely related to the wallcrossing phenomenon introduced by kontsevich and soibelman @xcite .",
    "making this relationship precise , and extending the construction of stability conditions to higher rank spectral curves , are some of the long - term motivations for the present project .    in the @xmath2 case",
    "these subjects have been treated recently by iwaki and nakanishi @xcite , and one of the goals in the higher rank case would be to extend the various different aspects of their theory .",
    "what we obtain from our construction for @xmath1 is that inside each chamber , that is to say inside a connected region where there are no bps states , our pre - building @xmath504 is a combinatorial geometric object associated . ] to @xmath495 . over a given chamber the pre - building will vary in a smooth way .",
    "as we cross a wall determined by a bps state , the pre - building will transform in some kind of `` mutation '' .",
    "the transformations of spectral networks are pictured in @xcite .",
    "kontsevich has outlined a far reaching program that associates a `` fukaya - type category with coefficients '' to a `` perverse sheaf of categories '' on a symplectic manifold @xmath3 .",
    "a major part of this program is the construction of stability structures on the fukaya category with coefficients in a sheaf of categories starting from the data of stability structures on the stalks of this sheaf .",
    "a symplectic fibration @xmath634 conjecturally gives rise to such a perverse sheaf of categories @xmath635 , whose stalks are , roughly speaking , the fukaya categories of the fibers of @xmath636 .",
    "in this situation , the fukaya category with coefficients in the sheaf of categories @xmath635 on @xmath3 is supposed to be equivalent to a fukaya type category associated to @xmath637 .",
    "recently , kapranov and schechtman @xcite have given a precise definition of the notion of a `` perverse sheaf of categories '' , which they call a _ perverse schober _ , in the case when @xmath3 is a riemann surface .",
    "there is a cy - manifold @xmath637 of complex dimension 3 associated to a spectral cover @xmath58 of a riemann surface @xmath3 , namely , the conic bundle over the cotangent bundle @xmath638 whose discriminant locus is @xmath58 .",
    "the natural morphism @xmath634 is a symplectic fibration , and therefore should define a perverse schober @xmath635 on @xmath3 .",
    "we formulate the following :    the schober @xmath635 on @xmath3 associated with the conic bundle , together with a stability structure on it , can be recovered from a family @xmath639 of versal harmonic @xmath640-maps , where @xmath0 is the multivalued differential corresponding to the given spectral cover @xmath58 .",
    "in this paper we have restricted to looking at buildings for @xmath1 .",
    "these two - dimensional objects remain geometrically close to the points of the original riemann surface , and this has been used in fundamental ways in our discussion .",
    "so it remains a big open problem how to go to a general theory for buildings of arbitrary rank , say for the groups @xmath94 .",
    "the image of @xmath3 becomes a very thin subset .",
    "maxim kontsevich suggested on several occasions that we should think of trying to `` thicken '' @xmath3 to something of the right dimension .",

    "the initial construction will give a neighborhood of @xmath3 of the correct dimension @xmath641 .",
    "the @xmath642-dimensional boundary of this neighborhood looks something like a bundle of @xmath643-spheres over the @xmath47-dimensional @xmath3 .",
    "probably , the analogue of our process described above will be some kind of discrete evolution of the boundary as we successively enlarge the region of the building that is being constructed .",
    "the two - manifold constructions which show up in our process for @xmath1 should be thought of as the boundaries of what are , for us , `` @xmath439-dimensional disk bundles over @xmath3 '' .      in @xcite , lawvere made the fundamental observation that metric spaces can be viewed as categories enriched over the poset @xmath644 , \\geq \\right)$ ] equipped with the ( symmetric ) monoidal structure given by addition of real numbers . furthermore , various metric constructions , such as cauchy completion , have natural categorical interpretations . motivated by these observations , flagg @xcite has shown that much of the basic theory of metric spaces carries over to categories enriched over an arbitrary value distributive quantale @xmath645 .",
    "the distance between two points in these `` generalized metric spaces '' is an object of the quantale @xmath645 instead of a real number .",
    "tits definition of a ( discrete ) building as a chamber system with a weyl group valued `` distance function '' ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) strongly suggests that the theory of buildings should naturally be situated within the theory of @xmath645-enriched categories for some suitable quantale @xmath645 that depends on the weyl group .",
    "this idea has been put forth by dolan and trimble , and is discussed in @xcite .    in a forthcoming work ,",
    "we hope to systematically develop a theory of @xmath646-buildings as categories enriched over a suitable variant of the category of enclosures considered in this paper .",
