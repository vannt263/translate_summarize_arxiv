    "yang  mills theory and general relativity are prime examples of theories with gauge symmetries , which have become indispensable in modern physics .",
    "the ashtekar formulation of canonical general relativity @xcite brought the two theories even closer . roughly speaking ,",
    "this was achieved by including the group of local rotations , as an extra gauge symmetry beside space ",
    "time diffeomorphisms .",
    "this allowed to incorporate lattice gauge theory techniques in the realm of background independent field theories and led to the development of loop quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "lattice gauge theories allow for non  perturbative quantization schemes , which are needed in particular for the understanding of quantum chromodynamics as well as quantum gravity .",
    "the success of such schemes relies on a clever choice of discrete observables @xcite transforming nicely under the gauge symmetries .",
    "these observables are based on holonomies , built out of the gauge connection , and on fluxes , built out of the electric field and  in non ",
    "abelian gauge theories  out of the connection , too .",
    "the major drawback of gauge formulations is , however , that it still needs the identification of a complete set of mutually independent gauge invariant degrees of freedom and observables .",
    "this is particularly important when it comes to the quantum theory .",
    "a gauge invariant basis for lattice field theory , allowing a convenient description of the gauge invariant hilbert space , is the so  called spin  network basis @xcite .",
    "such a basis has found wide applications in both lattice gauge theories and loop quantum gravity . in particular",
    ", it solved the problem of over  completeness of the wilson loop observables , as encoded by the mandelstam identities , which plagued the early developments of loop quantum gravity , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of the present work is to introduce another basis of the gauge - invariant hilbert space : the `` fusion basis '' . among its desirable properties ,",
    "one of the most important ones is that in this basis coarse  graining of states simplifies considerably with respect to an approach based on the spin ",
    "network basis @xcite .",
    "this feature makes it the natural candidate to study the large scale dynamics of loop quantum gravity in terms of coarse  graining and renormalization @xcite .",
    "the amenability of the fusion basis to coarse  graining is due to the fact that in non  abelian gauge theories , effective electric excitations ( or torsion excitations , in a gravity context ) emerge at large scales even if they are not present at the lattice scale @xcite .",
    "since these excitations are not present from the onset in the spin  network basis , one needs to devise extension of the `` standard '' framework .",
    "see @xcite for proposals .",
    "in contrast , the fusion basis improves this state of things in a twofold way : on the one hand it allows from the onset for both magnetic ( curvature ) and electric ( torsion ) excitations , and on the other it can be designed to have a notion of coarse  graining directly built in its combinatorial structure .",
    "the fusion basis we introduce here is adapted from the theory of topological phases in @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "we will therefore restrict here to @xmath0 dimensional lattice gauge theories and loop quantum gravity .",
    "for a strategy to generalize the fusion basis to @xmath1 dimensions , see @xcite .",
    "furthermore , another simplification we introduce in order to focus on the main ideas without bothering about technical details , is that we will consider only a finite gauge or structure group @xmath2 .",
    "we will comment on the application to lie groups in the discussion section , [ discussion ] .",
    "+ let us briefly describe and compare the main features of the spin  network and fusion basis .",
    "network basis diagonalizes at each link of the lattice the quadratic casimir operator built from the electric fluxes .",
    "these operators are gauge invariant and coincide with the electric contribution to the yang  mills hamiltonian . for a non  abelian structure group ,",
    "additional , gauge - invariant , information on the electric fluxes is encoded at the nodes , in so  called intertwiners .",
    "thus , the spin  network basis provides a polarization of the state space based on the flux observables .",
    "the fusion basis , on the other hand , diagonalizes wilson loop operators , i.e. traces of holonomies associated to closed paths . in this sense ,",
    "the fusion basis provides a polarization dual to the spin ",
    "network one . to avoid over  parametrization",
    ", one does , however , not include all possible wilson loops supported on the lattice , but only a certain hierarchically ordered set .",
    "a crucial feature of non  abelian gauge theories is that this set of wilson loops does _ not _ define a maximal set of commuting observables .",
    "in fact , it is necessary to also consider certain flux observables , based again on closed loops , that capture the electric ( or torsion ) degrees of freedom arising at scales larger than the lattice one .",
    "maybe surprisingly , these large scale data are not already encoded in the multilevel wilson loop observables .",
    "the fusion basis is designed to encode both wilson loop and large scale flux observables in a unified framework .",
    "in fact , it turns out that the fusion basis diagonalizes closed `` ribbon '' operators , which directly classify the magnetic ( curvature ) and electric ( torsion ) excitations .",
    "this notion of excitation has to be understood with respect to some vacuum state . here ,",
    "the relevant one is the so  called bf vacuum . taking its name from the bf topological field theory ,",
    "of which it is a physical state , this vacuum state is a gauge invariant state peaked sharply on vanishing curvature , i.e. on a flat connection .",
    "it is then not surprising , that the fusion basis framework bares a close relationship with the theory of extended topological quantum field theories on the mathematical side , and with topological phases and their defect excitations on the condensed matter side .",
    "in particular , bf theory can be described by so - called extended string net models @xcite .",
    "the classification of the excitations comes with an interesting mathematical structure , the drinfeld double @xmath3 of the gauge group @xmath2 . for this reason we will introduce and review various basic facts about the drinfeld double and its representation theory",
    "this is in fact the fundamental mathematical tool behind the definition of the fusion basis , since the irreducible representations of @xmath3 characterize the excitations of the model , while their tensor product describes their `` fusion '' .    after having introduced the fusion basis and the ribbon operators characterizing it",
    ", we will give an overview of various applications .",
    "firstly , we will discuss how to use the fusion basis to easily design multi ",
    "scale states .",
    "it is interesting to compare the tools developed here to the closely related philosophy underlying the introduction of tensor network states , which provide an ansatz for the ground state of yang ",
    "mills theories @xcite.dimensional gravity , on the other hand , the bf vacuum already provides the physical state of the theory , i.e. the state invariant under full diffeomorphism symmetry . fusion basis states , then , encode multi ",
    "particle states coupled to gravity .",
    "therefore , this basis could be a useful tool to understand their coupled dynamics .",
    "] secondly , using the muli ",
    "scale states , we describe a coarse  graining scheme based on the fusion basis . at this point of the discussion ,",
    "the advantage in using the fusion basis should be obvious : coarse  graining is directly given by the fusion of excitations , which are in turn naturally encoded in the fusion basis itself . in a follow up work ,",
    "we plan to discuss entanglement entropy in non ",
    "abelian lattice gauge theories , a topic which recently attracted increased attention @xcite .",
    "specifically , we will make use of the fusion basis to provide a new definition of entanglement entropy for such theories , and to compute it for a certain family of states .",
    "+ let us conclude this introduction with a note . in this paper , we will rely on a lot of previous work coming both from the context of topological phases with defects and from extended topological field theories .",
    "this material will be translated and adapted to our purposes .",
    "the reformulation of lattice gauge theory and loop quantum gravity in terms of extended topological field theory is parallel to @xcite .",
    "the fusion basis has been constructed already for string ",
    "net models @xcite . an explicit definition for @xmath4 , at @xmath5 root of unity , was given in @xcite , which is easily generalizable to modular fusion categories ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the fusion basis for more general fusion categories appeared  albeit only implicitly  in @xcite .",
    "our characterization of basic excitations is adapted from arguments in @xcite which were developed also in the context of string  net models . here , although we make use of the same idea of gluing states , we rephrase it in a context more amenable for applications to lattice gauge theory and loop quantum gravity .",
    "for this reason , we develop our arguments for the bf representation @xcite and work in the holonomy polarization .",
    "this will considerably facilitate the interpretation of the excitations generated and measured by ribbon operators in terms of standard gauge theory and loop quantum gravity observables .",
    "it will also help us to provide an interpretation of the corresponding operators defined for the turaev ",
    "viro based representations @xcite , where the operators are constructed via more abstract arguments within the flux ( spin ) polarization .",
    "the drinfeld double of ( finite ) groups and their representations have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "ribbon operators were introduced by kitaev @xcite and studied in great detail by bombin _",
    "_ @xcite in the context of a lattice gauge theory model .",
    "our discussion , however , will rather be based on a lattice-_independent _ description of the ribbon operators . while we believe that this can be fruitful in the study of yang  mills theory , it is definitely necessary for application to background independent theories , such as loop quantum gravity .   + this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec_bf ]",
    "we formulate the bf representation in @xmath0d .",
    "this provides also an interpretation of lattice gauge theories as topological field theories with defects , making the fusion basis available for these cases .",
    "then , we give the main argument for the appearance of the drinfeld double @xmath6 , in section [ sec_drinfeld ] ; in this section we also review the representation theory of the drinfeld double , and fix the relevant notations for the rest of the paper . section [ sec_fusionbasis ] is the core of the paper , where the fusion basis is introduced . in section [ sec_ribbons ] , we introduce the open ribbon operators that generate the fusion basis by acting on the bf vacuum , as well as closed ribbon operators that project onto the fusion basis states .",
    "finally , in section [ sec_coarsegraining ] , we discuss possible applications of the fusion basis , firstly for the multi - scale design of states , and secondly for coarse  graining .",
    "the paper has also a number of appendices , where technical calculations are relegated and further details on the bf representation are provided .",
    "in lattice gauge theories , observables can be given in terms of holonomies ( or wilson lines ) , encoding the magnetic degrees of freedom , and fluxes , encoding the electric degrees of freedom . in @xmath0 dimension both holonomy and flux observables test the continuum field along a one  dimensional path embedded in the spatial manifold .",
    "on a fixed graph ( or lattice ) one has only access to a restricted set of such holonomies and fluxes , that is those that can be composed from the elementary holonomies and fluxes associated to the links of the graph itself . in this way different graphs @xmath7 lead to different hilbert spaces @xmath8 , hence providing a representation of the holonomies and fluxes based on @xmath7 .",
    "one can however consider also all possible graphs at once ( or at least a suitable set of graphs allowing for infinite refinement ) by constructing a so  called inductive limit of the family of hilbert spaces @xmath9 .",
    "this allows for the representation of holonomies and fluxes based on arbitrary paths ( or again based on a suitable set of paths ) .",
    "such an inductive limit construction led to the ashtekar ",
    "isham ( ali ) representation @xcite of the kinematical observable algebra in loop quantum gravity . here",
    "the selection of a ( kinematical ) vacuum state is essential , which in the case of the ali representation is given by a state for which the expectation values vanishes for all operators composed from fluxes .",
    "this implies that the resulting hilbert space supports states which have vanishing flux expectation values almost everywhere . as the fluxes",
    "encode the spatial metric the states describe therefore an almost everywhere degenerate geometry .",
    "this was one of the motivations for the construction of an alternative representation based on a different actually dual  vacuum , sharply peaked on vanishing curvature @xcite .",
    "this vacuum is a solution of a topological field theory known as bf theory and describes in lattice gauge theory the weak coupling limit .",
    "bf theory plays also an important role in the gravity context : it is itself a formulation of @xmath0 dimensional gravity , and moreover , in @xmath1 dimensions , it is the starting point for the construction of spin  foam models , a covariant version of loop quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "a quantum deformed version @xcite , based on the turaev ",
    "viro topological theory dimensions , for a strategy to generalize to @xmath1 dimensions , see @xcite . ]",
    "@xcite , describing @xmath0 dimensional euclidean gravity with positive cosmological constant , is more directly formulated as an extended topological field theory . here",
    "the notion of defect excitations , supported in @xmath0 dimensions on punctures , is essential .    in this section",
    "we will shortly explain the bf representation for loop quantum gravity and a related understanding of lattice gauge theory as an extended topological field theory .",
    "the bf representation in @xcite has been based on an inductive limit involving triangulations and their dual lattices .",
    "we will review this notion and then lay out an alternative construction , similar to @xcite , which is nearer to the spirit of extended topological field theory . in the latter case",
    "the graphs or lattices have a less fundamental role .",
    "instead one uses punctures ( or ` defects ' ) which carry the excitations .",
    "these defect excitations are to be understood as deviations from a vacuum or alternatively violations of constraints , which characterize the vacuum .",
    "this vacuum is here given as the bf vacuum , i.e. a state without curvature ( magnetic excitation ) or torsion ( electric excitation ) .",
    "these considerations will also allow to understand lattice gauge theory as an extended topological field theory , that is a topological field theory with a ( here fixed ) number of defects allowed .",
    "the bf representation is based on a so  called inductive limit of hilbert spaces .",
    "the inductive limit is defined via a family of hilbert spaces labelled by elements of a partially ordered ( and directed ) set .",
    "each hilbert space of this family can be understood to capture a certain subset of the degrees of freedom of the continuum , given by the inductive limit . in this sense",
    "a given hilbert space of this family defines also a discretization .    in @xcite",
    ", such an inductive limit was based on the refinement of triangulations of a given @xmath10 hypersurface @xmath11 . specifically , given @xmath11 and a triangulation @xmath12 thereof ,",
    "the configuration space underlying the hilbert space @xmath13 is given by the moduli space of flat connection on @xmath14 , that is @xmath15 .",
    "here @xmath16 is the set of @xmath17-simplices , i.e. vertices , of the triangulation .",
    "as is well known , @xmath15 can be fully described by considering the set of holonomies along the links of a graph @xmath7 dual to the triangulation .",
    "clearly , the flatness conditions ensures that the specific choice of dual graph is irrelevant .",
    "then , @xmath13 is given by the gauge invariant functions of such holonomies , equipped with a specific inner product .",
    "for a well  defined inductive limit , the measure on the underlying gauge group @xmath18 has to be discrete , even if @xmath19 is a lie group @xcite .",
    "it is often convenient to choose a marked point on the manifold , the ` root ' , at which gauge invariance is relaxed .",
    "fully gauge - invariant functions can be re  obtained via a gauge averaging procedure .",
    "the advantage of having a root is clear if @xmath19 is a lie group : the gauge averaging procedure over @xmath19 equipped with a discrete measure would in general lead to many subtleties @xcite .",
    "physically , the root can be interpreted as a reference frame internal to the system .",
    "so far we have described the structure of the hilbert space @xmath13 on a fixed triangulation .",
    "what is missing is the inductive limit construction of the continuum hilbert space @xmath20 .",
    "consider two triangulations @xmath12 and @xmath21 , such that @xmath21 is a refininement of @xmath12 , i.e. @xmath22 .",
    "then , the inductive limit is based on the definition of embedding maps _ ,  : _ _ . roughly speaking , in the bf representation , the embedding maps multiply the states in @xmath13 with a set of delta  functions  hence the relevance of the discrete measure on the group  enforcing the triviality of the holonomy around every additional cycle present in @xmath23 but not in @xmath7 .",
    "notice that there is one such cycle for every element of @xmath24 .",
    "this defines @xmath20 .",
    "however , we also need to define operators @xmath25 compatible with the refinement procedure .",
    "this is easily done by requiring , _ ",
    "= _ ,  o _ . in @xcite ,",
    "such operators have been constructed and fully characterized .",
    "they are of two types .",
    "firstly , there are holonomy operators along root  based closed cycles of @xmath7 .",
    "these operators are labelled by a representation of @xmath19 and act by multiplication in the obvious way .",
    "secondly , there are so  called ` exponentiated flux operators ' . in @xmath26 , they are associated to edges of the triangulation @xmath12 itself .",
    "they act by translating the holonomies associated to the links of @xmath7 dual to the relevant edges of @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , they act as exponentiated derivate operators , hence their name .",
    "notice that the holonomy translation by the action of the exponentiated fluxes induces curvature defects at some vertices of the triangulation .",
    "in other words , it introduces non  trivial monodromies around cycles of @xmath7 dual to some vertices of @xmath12 . to obtain a state with a curvature defect at an arbitrary position @xmath27",
    ", one just has to first refine @xmath12 to @xmath21 in such a way that @xmath28 .",
    "finally , we stress that the operators just described , and properly defined in @xcite , are either gauge invariant or lead to gauge violations confined at the root .",
    "this last remark is important because in the present work we will allow torsion degrees of freedom to be carried by the vertices of the triangulation . which means that more general gauge  invariance violations will be allowed than in the setting presented above .",
    "although to avoid technicalities we will do this in the context of a finite group gauge theory , this generalization is conceptually of crucial importance for gravity ( which is , of course , based on a lie group ) .",
    "this is because , spinning particles induce torsion violation @xcite .",
    "the relevant operators , creating this more general type of excitations , have been introduced  albeit in a slightly different manner with respect to ours  by kitaev , in @xcite .",
    "he called them ` ribbon operators ' . in the context of @xmath26 gravity ,",
    "ribbon operators crucially provide dirac observables @xcite .",
    "we draw from this further motivation for the present work , in that we want on the one hand to give a lattice  independent definition of ribbon operators , and on the other to use their eigenvalues to fully characterize a basis of the quantum gravity hilbert space on @xmath11 .      here",
    "we present an alternative formulation of the bf - representation .",
    "its advantages are multiple : first , its language is closer to that of the turaev viro based representation @xcite .",
    "second , it translates a range of techniques used in the context of string  net models @xcite to an holonomy  based formalism .",
    "finally , it provides a lattice - independent description of the kitaev model @xcite , which can in turn be mapped onto an ` extended ' string  net model @xcite .",
    "the basic idea behind this alternative formulation is to replace the triangulation , its vertices and its dual graph , with a less rigid structure provided by punctured surfaces and general graphs on them .",
    "introducing an equivalence class among graphs allows for a first step towards the continuum limit .",
    "we say ` a first step ' because in this paper we will work with the defects locations , i.e. the punctures , kept fixed .",
    "the second , and last , step to the continuum limit would be to consider the inductive limit in which one allows for the addition of new punctures . a possible way to achieve this",
    "is sketched in appendix [ app_inductive ] .",
    "let us provide all the ingredients needed for the construction of this alternative description of the bf representation .",
    "+   + * finite group * + as mentioned above , we will work with a finite gauge group @xmath2 , with @xmath29 elements .",
    "some of our results can be generalized to lie groups , in both the bf and ali representations .",
    "this would , however , require lengthy ( measure theoretical ) technical discussions .",
    "here , we rather prefer to emphasize the underlying algebraic structures and the many analogies to the tv representation .",
    "indeed , one can understand the @xmath5deformation at root of unity characteristic of the tv representation , as in a certain sense turning @xmath30 into a finite ( quantum ) group @xmath4 .",
    "foam models with finite groups are used to study the behaviour of spin  foams under coarse graining @xcite , and we hope that the techniques developed here will be useful also in this context .",
    "we denote general elements of @xmath19 by @xmath31 and variations thereof , and the identity element by @xmath32 .",
    "the delta - function on the group is normalized so that @xmath33 if @xmath34 and vanishes otherwise .",
    "+     + * punctured surface * + in our analysis we will for simplicity exclusively work in the case in which @xmath11 is the two - sphere @xmath35 .",
    "fix @xmath35 to have a finite number @xmath36 of marked points , called punctures @xmath37 .",
    "define @xmath38 to be the surface @xmath35 with one disc removed around each puncture and with one point marked on the boundary of each such discs .",
    "we will call these points ` puncture  nodes ' .",
    "this structure is needed to describe torsion defects and later  on to define the gluing of states along punctures .",
    "now , consider finite directed graphs embedded into this surface .",
    "the graphs can have ` open links ' , i.e. links ending in a one  valent node , provided this node is a puncture  node .",
    "we require all other nodes to be two- or tri  valent .",
    "this is just a choice , that leads to a triangulation as dual complex and furthermore makes a translation to string nets ( via a standard group fourier transform ) more immediate .",
    "this restriction can however be easily dropped .    among all the possible graphs",
    ", there is a special subclass of ` minimal graphs ' .",
    "minimal graphs on a punctured sphere are defined by the following properties : ( _ i _ ) they capture the first fundamental group of the punctured sphere , @xmath39 , ( _ ii _ ) they have no contractible faces , that is all their faces enclose a puncture , ( _ iii _ ) they have no two  valent node , and ( _ iv _ ) they have one open link associated to each puncture , see figure [ fig_min ] for examples .",
    "given @xmath38 , minimal graphs are by no means unique . from our definition , it is not difficult to see that a minimal graph on @xmath40 must have exactly @xmath41 links , and @xmath42 internal nodes .    before moving to the next point , notice that the puncture  nodes play the all  important role of making possible the gluing of surfaces along the boundaries of the punctures discs .",
    "following ocneanu s insight @xcite , we will show how this operation unveils a wealth of algebraic structure hidden in the theory .",
    "+ * hilbert space @xmath43 * + the configuration space underlying the bf representation is , exactly as before , given by the moduli space of flat connections on @xmath35 minus some points ( or , equivalently , discs ) . in this case",
    ", this reads @xmath44 .",
    "this space is now completely characterized by the holonomies along the links of a minimal graph @xmath7 .",
    "hence , we define the hilbert space @xmath8 to be given by the set of gauge invariant functions @xmath45 on such a space of holonomies : : ^l , where @xmath46 denotes the number of links of the minimal graph .",
    "note also that we require the gauge group to act only at the internal nodes , and not at the puncture  nodes .",
    "more specifically , a gauge transformation is parametrized by a choice @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes an internal node and @xmath49 their number .",
    "it acts on a holonomy configuration @xmath50 as \\{u_n}_n \\{g_l}_l = \\{u^-1_t(l ) g_l u_s(l ) } _",
    "l , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 denote the source and target nodes of the link @xmath53 , respectively . if @xmath51 is a puncture  node .",
    "similarly for @xmath52 . ] finally , the inner product in @xmath8 is defined by [ innprod1 ] _ 1 , _",
    "2&= & _ \\{g_l } _",
    "to obtain a hilbert space @xmath43 associated directly to @xmath38 , we need to show how to identify various @xmath54 for different choices of ( possibly non - minimal ) graphs @xmath23 in @xmath38 .",
    "we do this by declaring two states based on different graphs as equivalent if they are related by a combination of the four operations we are now going to describe .",
    "the idea is that via a minimal graph one can already characterize @xmath55 completely : it gives access to the holonomies associated to all the non - contractible cycles ( those around the punctures ) , as well as giving the holonomy ( parallel transport ) between any couple of punctures .",
    "since the connection is locally flat , the path underlying each holonomy can be smoothly deformed .",
    "also , we can refine the graph , provided we ensure that the holonomies associated to the contractible cycles are all trivial , and that gauge invariance is preserved . as a consequence of gauge invariance , we can freely remove two  valent nodes .",
    "likewise for a non  minimal graph we can remove links , if the resulting graph still captures @xmath39 .",
    "formally , the operations are :    * _ link deformation_a link can be ( smoothly ) deformed as long as no other link , node or puncture is crossed .",
    "two states @xmath56 based on two graphs @xmath57 related by a link deformation are defined to be equivalent if they are described by the same function , i.e. if @xmath58 as functions on @xmath59 . *",
    "_ link orientation flip_after flipping the orientation of a link @xmath60 , the state @xmath61 equivalent to @xmath62 is [ equ1 ]  ( g_l^-1 , ) = ( g^-1_l , ) .",
    "* _ link subdivision / union_after the subdivision of a link @xmath63 , the state @xmath64 equivalent to @xmath65 is [ equ2 ] (g_l_1,g_l_2 , ) & = & ( g_l_2 g_l_1 , ) . * _ face removal / addition_after the addition of a new link @xmath53 , the graph gains a new closed face ( that is a contractible cycle ) @xmath66 with holonomy @xmath67 ( we are assuming that any link subdivision necessary to the addition of this new link has already been performed ) .",
    "then the state @xmath68 on the new graph which is equivalent to the original @xmath69 is [ equ3 ]  ( \\{g_l } ) & = & ( e , h_f ) ( \\{g_l } ) . where the factor @xmath70 in ( [ equ3 ] ) has been introduced to ensure that equivalent states have the same norm .    at this point",
    ", it is a simple exercise to show that the inner product is independent of the choice of representative in the equivalence class described above .",
    "this concludes the construction of @xmath43 .",
    "notice that the only information that is common to all @xmath8 , and therefore that is proper to @xmath43 itself , is the embedding of the punctures .",
    "this mirrors the properties of the states in @xmath43 : excitations are confined to the punctures and the state describe locally  flat gauge ",
    "invariant connections away from the punctures .    to obtain a continuum hilbert space allowing for excitations at arbitrary positions in @xmath11 we have to consider the inductive limit over hilbert spaces @xmath43 , where @xmath71 stands not only for the number of punctures ( denoted by @xmath36 ) but also for their embedding information . for a sketch on how to achieve this ,",
    "we refer to appendix [ app_inductive ] .",
    "all the construction presented here can be recast in a spin ",
    "network language , essentially by decomposing the states @xmath62 via the peter - weyl theorem onto a graph - dependent basis labeled by representation ",
    "theoretic data . in this formulation",
    "one would recover the so  called extended string nets @xcite , and the conditions above would be rephrased in a completely algebraic and combinatorial language .",
    "so far , we have been describing states in a graph - dependent and redundant fashion .",
    "graph independence is then shown to be recovered thanks to the introduction of appropriate equivalence relations .",
    "it would be , however , much more efficient to characterize the states directly , with no reference to any choice of graph .",
    "to this end we turn our focus on the punctures and the excitations they carry .",
    "let us start by analyzing the simplest cases , @xmath38 with @xmath72 .",
    "clearly , @xmath73 can not carry excitations , since @xmath74 is trivial .",
    "indeed , a minimal graph on @xmath73 has one link @xmath53 surrounding the puncture , and one link @xmath75 starting at @xmath76 and ending at the puncture  node ; now , contractibility of @xmath53 imposes @xmath77 , while gauge invariance at @xmath48 requires @xmath66 to be constant .",
    "thus , the simplest non  trivial case is that of the 2-punctured sphere , @xmath78 , which is topologically just a cylinder .",
    "the study of states on the cylinder is the subject of this section .",
    "the next  simplest case is @xmath79 .",
    "the three  punctured sphere is a fundamental object in @xmath10 topology .",
    "it goes under the names of ` trinions ' , or for obvious topological reasons`pair - of - pants ' .",
    "the analysis of states on @xmath79 will be the subject of the next section ( section [ sec_fusionbasis ] ) .",
    "the reason why @xmath79 is such a fundamental object is because out of it , by the procedure of successive gluing , one can produce any @xmath38 .",
    "is enough to build any @xmath80 , although the gluing procedure for the states becomes more subtle in this case .",
    "we will not discuss this in the present paper .",
    "] therefore , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and the gluing procedure are all that there is to know .",
    "let us hence start by discussing cylinders .",
    "cylinders play a special role in the characterization of ` basic ' excitations .",
    "simply put , the reason is that cylinders can be glued ` around a puncture ' without changing the topology of @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , via the gluing operation , states on a cylinder can also be interpreted as maps acting on @xmath43 . by successively gluing cylinders onto one - another ,",
    "it is straightforward to define a multiplication between cylinder states . in this way , states on the cylinder define an algebra , called the ocneanu ` tube  algebra ' .",
    "but what is the physical interpretation of this algebra ? by visualizing the cylinder as an annulus of space , one can think of the gluing operation as the addition of ` more  space ' around an excitation .",
    "topological excitations relevant to @xmath81 gravity should be stable under this operation .",
    "therefore , they are characterized by idempotents of the tube algebra , or ",
    "equivalently  by its indecomposable ( representation ) modules @xcite .",
    "as pointed out by ocneanu @xcite , this allows the interpretation of such idempotents as viable boundary conditions .    in the next subsection",
    ", we will show explicitly how the tube algebra is nothing but the drinfeld double algebra @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "thus , it follows immediately that states on the cylinder are labeled by irreducible representations @xmath83 of @xmath82 .",
    "also , from the above discussion , we see that any puncture on @xmath38 should be labeled by such a @xmath83 .",
    "hence we conclude that excitations in @xmath81 euclidean gravity can be classified in terms of irreducible representation @xmath83 of @xmath82 . in the case",
    "@xmath84 , the two labels defining such a @xmath83 can be directly interpreted as the mass and the spin of the excitation .",
    "this result is not new , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "however , in previous treatments , it was a found as a consequence of the presence of group  valued constraints ( moment maps ) .",
    "the gluing of cylinder states seems , however , to provide so far the simplest and most direct argument .",
    "of course , the next important question is to understand how different ` local ' states defined at each puncture , eventually fit together .",
    "not surprisingly , the answer lies in the study of the tensor product of representations , i.e. in the fusion algebra of @xmath85",
    ". this will be the content of section [ sec_fusionbasis ] .",
    "a minimal graph @xmath86 on @xmath78 possesses four links @xmath87 .",
    "we fix the compositions @xmath88 to be a closed loop winding once around the cylinder , and @xmath89 to go from the ` source ' puncture to the ` target ' puncture .",
    "finally , label the links of the graph with group elements @xmath90 .",
    "for brevity we set @xmath91 :    c    =    c    =    c    .",
    "a state in @xmath92 is given by a gauge invariant state ^_2(g_1,g_2,g_3,g_4 ) = ^_2(u g_1 , v g_2 u^-1 , g_3 v^-1 , v g_4 u^-1 ) , for any @xmath93 .",
    "taking advantage of the gauge invariance of @xmath94 , choosing @xmath95 and @xmath96 , we can fix @xmath97 .",

    "the reason for this choice will be made clear later .",
    "henceforth , we will often keep the @xmath101 implicit , and denote the basis states simply @xmath100 .    a general element of @xmath102",

    "the gluing is defined by identifying the marked points associated to the punctures along which the gluing is performed and matching the two edges which end at these marked points .",

    "indeed , it contains an extra closed face @xmath66 , i.e. a face surrounding no puncture . therefore , if we want the gluing to be mirrored at the level of the state spaces , this face must be associated with a trivial holonomy .",
    "this suggests to define first the gluing operation on basis states based on graphs via    cccccl : & _ _  & & f_ & & h_ + & ^^ & & ^^ & & ^^ ~p ( ^^ ) ,    and then to extend this by linearity to arbitrary states .",

    "let us consider the important case of gluing two cylinders to one - another .",
    "in this case , @xmath119 , and the gluing defines a multiplication operation on @xmath102 .",
    "notice that this is not a standard structure on a hilbert space .",
    "in particular , thanks to the gluing operation , @xmath102 carries a representation of algebra , named ocneanu s tube algebra .    consider two minimal states ^_2_1(\\{g_i } ) , ^_2_2(\\{g_i } ) _ 2 . then , following the prescriptions above , we obtain ( ^_2_1^_2_2)(\\{g_i , g_i})=    c    where the gray face is the new closed face @xmath66 on which the flatness constraint has to be imposed .",

    "the drinfeld double being a hopf algebra , it comes equipped with a series of operations and maps satisfying certain compatibility axioms .",

    "the defining relation for the antipode , which qualifies it as the generalization of the notion of inverse , is ( s)= ( s ) = , where @xmath142 is a linear map on @xmath3 , known as the counit , defined by @xmath143 ) = \\delta(h , e)\\mathbb i $ ] .",
    "notice the role played by both the multiplication and the comultiplication in the above identity .",

    "the @xmath106-product of two basis states of the form @xmath100 is a different basis state ( of the same form ) .",

    "in fact , on the torus @xmath401obtained e.g. by gluing the two punctures of the cylinder  we can consider closed ribbons associated to the two cycles generating the torus fundemental group .",
    "we can then define two different basis of @xmath402 diagonalizing the two different closed ribbons .",
    "the transformation between these two basis is given by the s  matrix .",

    "hence , the complete duality in this case .    at the level of the drinfeld double , @xmath405 , the s  matrix defines a transform exchanging the role of @xmath406 and its dual @xmath407 @xcite .",
    "in particular , this translates into the fact that the role of multiplication and co - mutiplication are also exchanged in a proper sense .",
    "this is why , in the analysis above , we have seen both the @xmath106multiplication and the co - multiplication structures appearing naturally in the context of lateral products .",
    "the s  matrix can also be defined through the eigenvalues for the operator defined by two interwoven closed @xmath408ribbons ( figure [ figs ] ) :    to define this interwoven operator one needs to build the closed ribbons by ` gluing ' open ribbons , after having applied the latter to the state in the appropriate order .",
    "see @xcite for details .",

    "however the three ribbons need to be fused ( or glued ) at an auxiliary puncture , we therefore need to consider a four  punctured sphere , see figure [ fig3s ] .",
    "moreover , we need to contract the free indices arriving at the auxiliary puncture with a clebsch - gordan coefficient .    by construction ,",
    "the fusion procedure at the auxiliary puncture includes a projection of this puncture to vanishing electric and magnetic ( curvature and torsion ) charge .",

    "we finally come to applications of the fusion basis and the related ribbon operators . here",

    "we will discuss a new notion of entanglement entropy for non  abelian lattice gauge theories that can be defined with the help of the fusion basis @xcite .      in the previous sections we constructed the fusion basis as well as ribbon operators which either generate it ( open ribbon operators @xmath413 ) or project onto it ( closed ribbon operators @xmath403 ) .",
    "crucially , the fusion basis is quite different from e.g. a spin ",
    "network basis , since it allows a direct access to observables at different scales .",
    "in fact , the @xmath144 labels of a fusion basis state @xmath414 $ ] correspond to the @xmath83 labels appearing in the set of closed ribbon operators @xmath415\\}$ ] , which project onto the fusion basis state . in turn ,",
    "such closed ribbon operators go around different number of punctures .",
    "this number provides us with a notion of ` scale ' , which we can associate to the closed ribbon operator @xmath416 $ ] , and hence to the label @xmath83 itself . in the case of gravity",
    "the geometry is encoded in the states . thus",
    "this notion of ` scale ' is not a priori associated to a notion of length or metric .",
    "it is rather an auxiliary notion , from which one can however deduce a length scale _ once a choice of state is given _ , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "note that we are not forced to follow the ` linear ' construction of the fusion basis as indicated in section [ fusionb ] : we can be more flexible .",
    "take for example a regular square lattice with @xmath417 plaquettes , with @xmath418 for some @xmath419 . to obtain the topology of a punctured sphere we close off this lattice with one ` big plaquette ' , see figure [ fig_latt ] .",
    "this corresponds to the choice of free boundary conditions for the original lattice .",
    "the ` big plaquette ' has 4 two  valent and @xmath420 three  valent nodes along its boundary .",
    "each plaquette can then carry an elementary curvature ( i.e. magnetic ) excitations .",
    "the gau  constraint violations ( i.e. torsion or electric excitations ) would usually sit on the nodes of the lattice .",
    "however , for the regular square lattice it is immediate ( and natural ) to move also these excitations onto the plaquettes . to do this , we restore gauge invariance at the two , three and four  valent nodes , but add an open link to all the four  valent nodes , pointing in one direction , toward the center of  say  the top - left plaquette .",
    "thus it is only the two  valent and three  valent nodes on the boundary of the ` large ' plaquette , for which we ignore the gau  constraint violations . to also allow for a gau   constraint violation at the ` big plaquette ' we introduce an open link at one of its corners .",
    "we are now in the setting discussed in this paper : each plaquette can be identified with a puncture , which can carry both curvature and torsion excitations . to define a fusion basis we have to decide on an ordering in which the punctures or plaquettes are fused to larger ones . to reach a homogeneous definition ,",
    "we can first fuse pairs of plaquettes in @xmath421direction and then pairs of plaquettes in @xmath422direction ( leaving the ` big plaquette ' untouched ) . this coarse  graining procedure can be repeated until we remain with just two plaquettes , which represent the two  punctured sphere .",
    "the corresponding fusion basis diagonalizes closed ribbon operators , @xmath423 that go around single plaquettes , operators @xmath424 that go around pairs ( in @xmath421direction ) of plaquettes , operators @xmath425 that enclose quadruples of plaquettes , and so on .",
    "correspondingly , the different scales of the basis states are described by sets of representation labels @xmath426 , where @xmath427 indicates the scale given by the number @xmath428 of plaquettes surrounded .",
    "hence , we see that the fusion basis is ideal to design states with a prescribed multi - scale behavior of observables .",
    "we expect that this will help to design low  energy states for yang  mills ( lattice ) theory , by merging our tools with the techniques developed for this purpose in the context of tensor network states or mera ( multi  scale entanglement renormalization ansatz , @xcite ) , see @xcite and also @xcite for some recent developments .",
    "the advantage of using the fusion basis is that it comes with multi ",
    "scale observables , that are automatically diagonalized by the fusion basis itself",
    ".    the fusion basis can also be useful in covariant ( space  time ) approaches to renormalization and coarse graining of lattice gauge theories and spin ",
    "foams @xcite . here",
    ", the partition function associated to a space  time building block can be represented by a state on the boundary of this block @xcite .",
    "using the fusion basis to represent this state would allow to keep control in particular over the torsion excitations , which are generated by coarse graining in non ",
    "abelian gauge theories , and which are rather difficult to handle in the spin  network basis ( see next section , and especially @xcite ) .",
    "we will discuss here the coarse  graining of gauge theory and loop quantum gravity states , explain the intricacies of this procedure , and motivate the use of the fusion basis to define coarse  graining .",
    "we will work in the context of a fixed ( initial ) graph , or lattice , thus the discussion in this section is independent of the question on which representation ( ali versus bf ) we use . in the context of loop quantum gravity coarse graining has been discussed in @xcite .    to start with",
    ", one considers an ( initial ) graph @xmath7 and associates to it the hilbert space @xmath8 of functions @xmath429 of the graph connection . here",
    ", @xmath46 denotes the number of links , while the inner product in @xmath8 is given by .",
    "coarse graining in a canonical framework is usually discussed using density matrices , which we will here denote by @xmath430 ( instead of @xmath83 which we reserved for the representation labels of the drinfeld double @xmath82 ) .",
    "pure states are then represented in the holonomy basis by [ pured ] = || = _ g , g | \\ { g}\\ { g}| , where = ( \\ { g } ) .",
    "the coarse  graining of a density matrix is defined as follows .",
    "first , choose a splitting of the holonomies @xmath431 attached to the links of the graph @xmath7 under consideration , into two sets of finer @xmath432 and coarser @xmath433 holonomies . starting from a density matrix @xmath430 for the initial system , a coarser density matrix can then be defined by summing over the finer degrees of freedom , [ cdensity ] ^c ( \\{g^c } , \\ { g^c } )",
    "= _ g^f ( \\{g^c } , \\{g^f } , \\{g^c } , \\{g^f } ) , where @xmath434 denotes the number of finer links , i.e. those links carrying ` finer ' holonomies .    in general",
    ", however , the graph under consideration will ` break apart ' once the finer links are removed . to avoid this",
    ", we can first ( unitarily ) transform the state onto a lattice where all the finer links one wishes to integrate out are given by loops , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "( in @xcite such transformations are called ` controlled rotation unitary gates ' . ) this way , removing these loops leaves us with a connected coarser lattice .",
    "but this coarse  graining procedure has at least two major drawbacks .",
    "( @xmath435 ) despite providing a certain control over the coarser and finer variables in terms of the holonomies , it completely lacks control over their conjugated variables , i.e. the ( electric ) fluxes .",
    "this is an important issue , especially in the context of loop quantum gravity , where the fluxes encode the metrical information of the ( spatial ) geometry . from this perspective , one would rather be tempted by defining a coarse  graining procedure in terms of both holonomies and flux variables .",
    "( @xmath436 ) moreover , the coarse density matrix is in general gauge invariant only under diagonal transformations , that is under those gauge transformations which agree in their action on the @xmath437 and @xmath438 variables .",
    "this is the case even if the finer density matrix was invariant under arbitrary gauge transformations at every single node .",
    "this full invariance holds in particular for pure density matrices constructed as in from gauge invariant states .",
    "note that this issue arises only in _",
    "non_abelian gauge theories . indeed , in abelian gauge theories",
    "this issue does not appear if the finer variables are associated to loops .",
    "the reason being that gauge transformations act by adjoint action on holonomies associated to loops and are therefore trivial for abelian structure groups .",
    "in other terms , in this latter case one has a simple procedure to coarse  grain gauge ",
    "invariant variables . on the contrary , for non  abelian gauge theories , the spin ",
    "network basis for density matrices is not stable under coarse graining , and is therefore quite inconvenient for this purpose .",
    "of course , one could consider an extension to non  gauge invariant spin  network states as proposed in @xcite , however , the main appeal of the spin ",
    "network basis is the straightforward implementation of gauge invariance .",
    "a neat solution to issue ( @xmath436 ) would consist in providing a basis which allows for a coarse  graining in terms of gauge  invariant variables . here , one not only needs a maximally commuting subset of observables ( which specifies a choice of basis ) , but also their conjugated observables , which brings us back to issue ( @xmath435 ) .    before discussing a proposal for such a procedure in the next section ,",
    "let us mention another possibility based on density matrix factorization .",
    "this consists in finding a transformation which decouples the finer holonomy variables ( which we assume to be based on loops ) from the rest of the state .",
    "that is , after the transformation , the density matrix takes the product form = ^c ^. upon coarse  graining , this would simply yield the density matrix @xmath439 . in this case",
    "@xmath439 would be fully gauge invariant  provided",
    "this is the case for the initial density matrix @xmath430 .",
    "however , such a transformation which allows us to cast density matrices into a product form , clearly depends on the initial states .",
    "therefore , the coarse  graining itself would not be controlled by a choice of coarser and finer observables , but rather by the form of the initial states .",
    "we mention this possibility here , because this type of decoupling of finer and coarser variables underlies the mera approach @xcite .",
    "let us now discuss a coarse  graining procedure in which the splitting of the observable algebra into coarser and finer variables is central . here",
    "one can consider the kinematical , that is gauge covariant observable algebra , or the algebra of almost gauge invariant observables .",

    "( 1 ) first , find a canonical transformation such that the new variables split into coarser and finer sets of variables .",
    "crucially , the sets of coarser and finer variables must commute with each other .",
    "also , one should take care of preserving the form of the symplectic structure given by ( [ pb1 ] ) , since this is at the basis of the interpretation of the variables in terms of holonomies and fluxes .",
    "( 2 ) then , as before , one can simply use a polarization of the wave functions in the new holonomy variables and integrate out the finer holonomy variables , while keeping the coarser holonomies fixed , as in ( [ cdensity ] ) .",
    "the coarser holonomies and the coarser fluxes give ( conjugated ) observables characterizing the coarser states .    therefore , this procedure is not different from the one described at the end of section [ densitym ] , but rather an amendment thereof .",
    "this amendment , which basically prescribes in more detail how to split the holonomies into coarser and finer sets , allows us , to gain control over the coarse  graining of the fluxes as well .",
    "now , one can ask what kind of transformations would preserve the symplectic structure ( [ pb1 ] ) hence keeping the interpretation of the variables as holonomies and fluxes intact .",
    "examples for such transformations are constructed in detail in @xcite .",
    "we review the construction in @xcite shortly , as it is closely related to ribbon operators .    holonomies are easy to treat , since we can simply consider compositions @xmath448 that result in ` new ' holonomies @xmath449 attached to ` new ' links @xmath450 built out of the corresponding links on the initial graph . for the fluxes",
    ", we can consider combinations of the following type ( see @xcite for more detailed definitions ) [ cfl ] x_l:= _ l ( l ) g^-1_s(l ) s(l ) x_l g _ s(l ) s(l ) .",
    "here , @xmath451 is a set of links , so that the dual of these links form a connected path made out of edges of the triangulation ( or  more generally  out of edges of the dual complex to the graph under consideration ) .",
    "this connected path should be interpreted to be dual to a ` new ' link @xmath75 .",
    "the holonomies @xmath452 denote the parallel transport from a node @xmath453 , which will be the source node of the new link @xmath75 to the source node @xmath51 of the link @xmath53 . in this way",
    ", we sum up the fluxes in one and the same reference system , provided by @xmath453 . an explicit procedure to find phase space splittings into coarser and finer variables based on such transformations",
    "can be found in @xcite .    in a loop quantum gravity context ,",
    "the fluxes are @xmath454valued and encode the edge vectors  for the edges dual to the links  in a reference frame associated to the nodes of the graph .",
    "this interpretation also holds for the coarse  grained fluxes ( [ cfl ] ) and thus justifies such a coarse  graining prescription .",
    "the exponentiated action of the coarser or ` integrated ' fluxes , as defined in , agrees with the translation part of the open ribbon operators as discussed in section [ oribbon ] , see @xcite .",
    "the holonomy ( or multiplication ) part of the ribbon operator is also constructed via a composition of holonomies , following the same prescription we employed in this section .",
    "hence , ribbon operators use a coarse  graining of fluxes and holonomies analogous to the one described here .",
    "there is nevertheless an important difference .",
    "the holonomy part and the translational part of a ribbon operator commute with each other : the translational part corresponds to a flux integrated along a path of edges in the triangulation , and the holonomy part is associated to a path in the dual lattice . for the ribbon",
    "these two paths are parallel ( in fact could be seen as the boundaries of the ribbon ) , whereas a holonomy and its conjugated flux are based on a link and edge respectively , that are transversal to each other .",
    "we have so far discussed the gauge covariant phase space .",
    "the coarse  graining procedure described above would give us control over the coarser holonomy and flux variables , but would suffer also from a violation of ( full ) gauge invariance for the coarse density matrix . in the canonical formalism , gauge invariance is encoded in gau  constraints associated to each node @xmath48 , [ gauss2 ] g_n= _ l : s(l)=n x_l + _",
    "l : t(l)=n x_l^-1 .",
    "geometrically , these constraints demand the closure into a polygon of the edges dual to the links ending or starting at @xmath48 .    with such an interpretation , one might expect that the gau  constraint are preserved under coarse  graining , as the coarser gau  constraints would demand that the coarser edges of the coarser triangulation close , too .",
    "this is , however , generally not the case @xcite .",
    "the reason is the following .",
    "the coarser fluxes have to be parallel transported to a common frame .",
    "now , if this parallel transport has to go through a region with curvature , the coarser gau  constraint will in general not hold .",
    "hence , we effectively obtain torsion , defined as a violation of the gau  constraint , due to the presence of curvature . such an effect , which was named curvature  induced torsion in @xcite , is strictly related to the need of deforming the gau  constraint in phase spaces describing piecewise homogeneously  curved ( instead of piecewise flat ) geometries @xcite ( see also @xcite , for an analysis in four dimensions ) . in terms of defect excitations",
    "discussed in this paper , torsion excitations interpreted as spinning particles can arise from the fusion of two spinless defects , since two particles can have orbital angular momentum .",
    "as mentioned , we could attempt to use gauge invariant variables for the coarse  graining , which would avoid loosing gauge invariance . at the phase space level",
    ", this would also mean that the gau  constraints become redundant .",
    "in fact , implementing gauge invariance in phase space means to consider only the constraint hypersurface where the gau  constraint is satisfied , and at the same time only gauge invariant functions on such phase space .",
    "but it is a very involved task to come up with a phase space description involving only completely gauge invariant observables .",
    "it is much easier to work with an almost gauge invariant set  up .",
    "this consists in choosing a node , called root @xmath455 , as global reference frame , to which all fluxes and holonomies are parallel transported . in other words , in considering only root  based holonomies and fluxes .",
    "the resulting variables are invariant under all gauge transformations , except for those at the root , which act by adjoint action .",
    "a further , necessary , step consists in identifying an independent set of observables .",
    "indeed , the fluxes are related by the gau  constraints ( [ gauss2 ] ) , while holonomies along loops must satisfy certain algebraic relations .",
    "such an independent set of variables can be obtained by choosing a rooted spanning ",
    "tree of the underlying graph @xmath7 .",
    "this defines leaves @xmath300 , i.e. links which are not part of the tree .",
    "each leaf @xmath300 defines a unique closed loop , which starts and ends at the root and which contains only links of the tree and the one leaf @xmath300 .",
    "hence , each leaf defines an holonomy variable @xmath456 .",
    "furthermore , for what concerns the fluxes , we can consider the leaf s flux @xmath457 parallel transported to the root : @xmath458 .",
    "the set of variables @xmath459 , with @xmath300 running through all leaves , gives a complete parametrization of the almost gauge invariant phase space .",
    "and they do so by essentially preserving the form of the symplectic structure of the gauge covariant phase space : \\{*x*^i _ , * x*^j_}=_l , lf^ijk*x*^k _ , \\{*x*^i_,h_ } = _ ,  h _ ^i - _ ^-1, ^i h_ \\{h_,h_}=0 .    the coarse  graining procedure can now be run analoguesly to the gauge covariant case .",
    "in particular , there is a well defined sense in which both the graph and the tree are coarse  grained to a coarser graph and tree .",
    "based on such a choice of coarser graph and tree , one can perform a split into coarser and finer variables , as needed for coarse  graining .",
    "all this is discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "notice that within this procedure , one is working with an `` almost '' gauge  invariant state space , which after coarse  graining still captures the `` almost '' gauge  invariant observables .",
    "therefore , we have in this way exhibited a structure which is stable under the coarse  graining procedure .",
    "this comes , however , at a price : whereas all the initial fluxes could have been reconstructed via the gau  constraint , this is not the case at the level of the coarser fluxes .",
    "of course , one could use some ( ad hoc ) gau  constraints of the form ( [ gauss2 ] ) to define fluxes associated to the links of the coarse tree .",
    "but these fluxes would not correspond to the fluxes one obtains via coarse  graining from the finer fluxes . in this sense ,",
    "one looses important information , which in the case of loop quantum gravity encodes the coarser spatial metric . once again",
    ", the underlying reason is that curvature can lead to torsion on a coarse  grained level .",
    "this is naturally taken into account in a coarse  graining scheme based on the fusion basis .",
    "we now turn to describing such a scheme .",
    "as discussed in section [ multiscale ] , the fusion basis diagonalizes operators which can be naturally interpreted as describing different coarse  graining scales .",
    "therefore , the fusion basis @xmath460 $ ] comes equipped with a natural coarse  graining scheme , in which one sums directly over its @xmath3 representation labels .",
    "let us first review , what kind of observables these representation labels are related to . as discussed in section [ clchri ] ,",
    "the fusion basis diagonalizes the closed charge ribbon operators associated to the fusion tree structure .",
    "more generally , closed ribbon operators @xmath461 $ ] project onto states @xmath460 $ ] for which @xmath462 , where @xmath167 and @xmath463 label the branches in the fusion tree associated to the fusion basis , whereas @xmath336 labels its one  valent nodes ( i.e. its endpoints ) .",
    "we want now to compare the coarse  graining procedure provided by the fusion basis and closed ribbon operators , to the one provided by the holonomy polarization in the almost gauge invariant set  up . to this end",
    ", we assume that we work with a @xmath71punctured sphere @xmath38 and a minimal graph , but do not have torsion excitations at the punctures , i.e. we have gauge invariant wave functions .",
    "the holonomy polarization uses a basis which can be symbolically written as @xmath464(\\bullet)= \\prod_\\ell \\delta(g_\\ell , \\bullet)$ ] , where @xmath300 runs over the leaves of a spanning tree in the graph @xmath7 , and the number of leaves is given by @xmath465 .",
    "the operators diagonalizing this basis are given by root ",
    "based wilson loop operators @xmath466 .",
    "these wilson loops need _ not _ be restricted to class functions , i.e. functions of the trace of the loop holonomy .    on the other hand ,",
    "the closed ribbon operators @xmath467 $ ] are fully gauge invariant observables .",
    "in particular , the label @xmath468 measures the conjugacy class ( or trace ) of the wilson loop along the closed ribbons , instead of the full loop holonomy .",
    "while with the holonomy basis we describe holonomies only around a fundamental set of @xmath469 cycles , the subindex @xmath463 of the fusion basis @xmath470 $ ] runs over @xmath471 values and we have as many ( not completely independent ) punctures . ]",
    "closed ribbon operators .",
    "in addition to the holonomy information , the closed ribbon operators @xmath467 $ ] encode flux observables within the labels @xmath472 .",
    "more precisely , these are integrated fluxes associated to a closed path .",
    "note that in the almost gauge invariant phase space , discussed in the previous section , we only had fluxes associated to open paths , provided we assume that the graph does not include loops ( i.e. links with the same source and target node ) .",
    "another way to talk about the @xmath472 labels is to say that they measure torsion ( electric charge ) . indeed , if we assume a gauge invariant state we immediately find ( see section [ pfusion ] ) that @xmath473 is equal to the trivial representations for those ribbons @xmath467 $ ] that go directly around the punctures .",
    "notice that there are exactly @xmath71 of such punctures .",
    "but for non - abelian groups , we can well have non - trivial labels @xmath473 for the remaining @xmath474 closed ribbons . these observables are crucial to keep track of how the gau  constraint gets deformed under coarse  graining .",
    "as explained in section [ pfusion ] , a basis for fully gauge invariant states satisfying the gau  constraints at all punctures can be obtained from the fusion basis @xmath460 $ ] by setting the appropriate indices @xmath475 equal to the trivial representation , denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "correspondingly , the relative @xmath476 indices in the @xmath477 multi - index are also trivialized .",
    "furthermore , we also sum over the @xmath478 labels ^g.i._[\\{(c_m , r_j ) } , \\{c_k}]= ( _ k ) _ \\{i_k } _ [ \\{(c_m , r_m ) } , \\{c_k,0 } ; \\{i_k,0 } ] . in this formula , we have split the index @xmath463 running over the edges of the fusion tree into two sets @xmath336 and @xmath479 , labelling the punctures ( or leaves of the fusion tree ) and the remaining edges of the fusion tree , respectively .",
    "note that if one allows for states violating the gau  constraints at the punctures , the @xmath480 labels encode only local information , and are measured by projective operators given by gluing cylinder fusion basis states @xmath481 $ ] .",
    "the closed ribbon operators @xmath467 $ ] and the operation of gluing of the cylinder fusion basis states give together a maximal commuting set of observables characterizing the fusion basis .",
    "coarse  graining in the fusion basis means that these observables determine the splitting into coarser and finer ones .",
    "in addition , there are conjugated observables , given by open ribbon operators extending from one puncture to another puncture .",
    "we leave it to future research to find a complete set of such independent operators .",
    "the coarse  graining scheme based on the fusion basis will also induce a splitting of the conjugated observables into a coarser and a finer set . to deduce this splitting one",
    "needs to study in more detail the commutation relations or the corresponding symplectic structure in phase space .    the coarse  graining",
    "is now given by summing over the finer variables , just as usual .",
    "consider a density matrix defined using a fusion basis by = _",
    "\\{},\\{i } _",
    "\\{},\\{i } | _ [ \\{},\\{i } ] _ [ \\{},\\{i } | .",
    "this density matrix is adapted to the intended coarse  graining ( or fusion ) of punctures into new ` larger ' punctures .",
    "that is the @xmath71 punctures are partitioned into @xmath482 sets , each including at least two punctures .",
    "the fusion tree needs then to include a subtree for each set that describes the fusion of the punctures in this set .",
    "we label the variables attached to the subtrees with a super - index @xmath66 , except for the pairs @xmath483 , which prescribe the excitations for the fused punctures .",
    "we label these pairs and the remaining variables with a super - index @xmath484 .    working in the polarization given by the fusion basis variables ,",
    "the coarser density matrix is then defined by    ^c= _ \\{^f } , \\{i^f } . in this scheme",
    "we get rid of all indices @xmath485 , assuming that these are all classified as finer information .",
    "an alternative scheme introduces new indices @xmath486 for the coarser punctures .",
    "this scheme is based on an extension of the hilbert space ( before coarse  graining ) .",
    "we will explain this scheme in the forthcoming work @xcite , where we will also discuss entanglement entropy .",
    "in this work we introduced the fusion basis for @xmath0 dimensional lattice gauge theories , in particular with non  abelian structure groups . the basis is well adapted for the weak coupling regime and for describing topological bf theory with defects .",
    "the latter theory can also be taken as a description of @xmath0 dimensional gravity coupled to ( possibly spinning ) point particles .",
    "in contrast to the spin ",
    "network basis @xcite , the fusion basis is a multi ",
    "scale basis .",
    "it diagonalizes the traces of a certain multi ",
    "scale set of wilson loop observables .",
    "this set does in itself not form a maximal set of commuting observables : for non  abelian gauge groups one has rather to add further gauge ",
    "invariant observables describing electric excitations .",
    "importantly , the electric ( or torsion , in a gravitational context ) excitation might emerge on larger scale even for gauge invariant states .",
    "this fact make it hard to control large scales in a spin  network basis . for this reason , the fusion basis",
    "is ideally suited for coarse  graining in lattice gauge theories and loop quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "more specifically , we have seen that the fusion basis comes with a number of advantages . that we list and comment here below .",
    "* the fusion basis incorporates the notion of basic excitations and their fusion to coarse grained excitations , hence making explicit the quasi  local structure of the excitations relative to the bf vacuum ; * it makes transparent the drinfeld double algebra structure , which in past ( loop quantum gravity ) discussions was rather hidden in the algebra of constraints @xcite ; * it incorporates a notion of cutting and gluing pieces of spatial manifolds along boundaries and thus comes automatically with a natural notion of local subsystems ( see e.g. @xcite for a different notion ) .",
    "moreover , in the context of @xmath0 dimensional loop quantum gravity coupled to point particles , the fusion basis    * provides naturally and directly the physical states of the theory , even for states including spinning particles ( i.e. states with torsion ) ; * and diagonalizes the gauge and diffeomorphism invariant ( dirac ) observables of the theory , which are given in terms of the closed ribbon operators .",
    "this shows that the fusion basis is a convenient tool for describing the coupling of multiple particles to @xmath0 dimensional gravity .",
    "it would be of particular interest to consider a thermodynamic or continuum limit , possibly resulting in gravity coupled to a matter field , see also @xcite .",
    "a further question in this direction is whether the resulting system can be described by a matter field propagating on an effective non  commutative space ",
    "time , as derived in a covariant framework by @xcite .",
    "the use of the fusion basis emphasizes the drinfeld algebra or quantum double structure of @xmath0 gravity coupled to point defects .",
    "this facilitates the comparison with other quantization schemes @xcite , such as the combinatorial quantization for chern - simons theory @xcite .",
    "let us also point out the recent work @xcite , which reformulates kitaev models as a special case of combinatorial quantization via a reformulation of the latter in terms of a hopf - algebra gauge theory .",
    "+ furthermore , in relation to coarse  graining , we emphasized that the fusion basis    * solves a deep problem related to coarse  graining in the spin ",
    "network basis : in non ",
    "abelian gauge theories , coarse  graining generally leads to torsion degrees of freedom , even though these are not initially present , therefore the spin ",
    "network basis can not be stable under coarse  graining . the fusion basis , on the other hand , incorporates torsion degrees of freedom from the onset , hence allowing for a consistent coarse ",
    "graining scheme ; * moreover , the fusion basis can be naturally used to design multi ",
    "scale states , in the sense that it diagonalizes a set of operators defined at all available scales ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) , a fact that makes it ideal for discussing coarse  graining schemes .",
    "we hope to make all this explicit within a new tensor network coarse  graining framework , by generalizing the recently developed schemes of @xcite .",
    "one of our principal aims is studying the continuum limit and coarse  graining of spin  foam models @xcite . in the context of @xmath0 dimensional gravity models ,",
    "a particularly intriguing question is how to flow via coarse  graining from models based on flat building blocks to models based curved building blocks , hence recovering in the quantum theory the classical result of @xcite .",
    "more specifically , for spin  foam models one expects a transition from @xmath30 to the quantum deformed @xmath4 .",
    "this requires besides a condensation of curvature degrees of freedom to a constant curvature state , also a condensation of torsion degrees of freedom .",
    "it is therefore important to have coarse  graining schemes which do not throw away the torsion degrees of freedom .",
    "notice also that the fusion basis is already available for @xmath4 , with @xmath5 root of unity , @xcite and has in some aspects even a simpler structure than in the finite group case .",
    "( even more so , if one compares with @xmath30 , since the corresponding fusion category is not finite . )",
    "the finiteness of @xmath4 makes this choice particularly attractive for numerical approaches to coarse  graining , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "+ we have also anticipated that    * the fusion basis can be used to provide a new definition of entanglement entropy for non  abelian gauge theories .",
    "let us add here , that in contrast to other proposals , this new definition leads to finite results , even in the continuum limit , for states describing a finite number of defects @xcite .",
    "finally , we conclude with some remarks about open problems and further directions of investigation .    in this paper our analysis has been confined to lattice gauge theories with finite gauge groups .",
    "it is , however , an important point to generalize our analysis to lie groups . for lie groups",
    "there are two very different choices for the underlying topology of the state space and the related inner product .",
    "one possibility is to choose a discrete topology and measure on the gauge group , which is in fact necessary for the bf representation for _ continuum _ loop quantum gravity .",
    "in particular , this is needed for the bf vacuum to have a finite norm @xcite .",
    "alternatively , if one is only interested in lattice gauge theory with a fixed lattice or with a fixed number of excitations ( i.e. of punctures ) , one can also adopt the usual ( continuous ) haar measure on the gauge group .",
    "drinfeld double representations and their tensor product , based on this choice , have been discussed in the case of @xmath30 in @xcite .",
    "at last , a further interesting research direction consists of generalizing the fusion basis to @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "one possibility to achieve this is to use the idea formulated in @xcite , where it is proposed to formulate a @xmath1 dimensional theory of flat connections with defects , as a theory of flat connections in one less dimensions at the price of defining it on some topologically complicated cauchy surface based on a heegard splitting of the 3-dimensional hypersurface .",
    "the idea is then to use the machinery described in this paper to define a basis and operators for the @xmath1 dimensional theory , in order to find a characterization of its basic excitations .",
    "also in @xmath1 dimensions , one expects the maximal set of commuting observables to include a multi  scale set of wilson loops .",
    "torsion degrees of freedom , on the other hand , are now captured by electric flux observables based on closed surfaces , as defined in @xcite . however , using the techniques of @xcite , these can be recast into ribbon operators acting around the non trivial cycles of the topologically complicated cauchy surface designed to encode the @xmath1 dimensional theory .",

    ", the index @xmath71 in @xmath299 and @xmath43 will not only denote the number of punctures ( which we here denote by @xmath36 ) but also the embedding information of the punctures .",

    "alternatively a puncture can be described by a point in the manifold equipped with a tangent vector at this point @xcite .",
    "the open links of the graphs have to end at the marked points of the small disks ( in one description ) or to approach the punctures tangential to the associated vector ( in the other description ) .",
    "this additional structure of the punctures allows the inclusion of torsion defects and is also crucial in order to make the gluing operation well defined .",

    "<S> we introduce a new basis for the gauge  invariant hilbert space of lattice gauge theory and loop quantum gravity in @xmath0 dimensions , the fusion basis . in doing so </S>",
    "<S> , we shift the focus from the original lattice ( or spin  network ) structure directly to that of the magnetic ( curvature ) and electric ( torsion ) excitations themselves . </S>",
    "<S> these excitations are classified by the irreducible representations of the drinfeld double of the gauge group , and can be readily `` fused '' together by studying the tensor product of such representations . </S>",

    "<S> local structure of the observable algebra explicit . </S>",
    "<S> since the fusion basis allows for both magnetic and electric excitations from the onset , it turns out to be a precious tool for studying the large scale structure and coarse  graining flow of lattice gauge theories and loop quantum gravity . </S>",
    "<S> this is in neat contrast with the widely used spin  network basis , in which it is much more complicated to account for electric excitations , i.e. for gau  constraint violations , emerging at larger scales . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , since the fusion basis comes equipped with a hierarchical structure , it readily provides the language to design states with sophisticated multi  scale structures . </S>",
    "<S> another way to employ this hierarchical structure is to encode a notion of subsystems for lattice gauge theories and @xmath0 gravity coupled to point particles . in a follow  up work , we will exploit this notion to provide a new definition of entanglement entropy for these theories .     </S>"
