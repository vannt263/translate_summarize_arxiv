    "useful information about a complex system is often obtained by introducing probe particles into it . after the probe particles have come to a steady state with the system ,",
    "their static and dynamic behavior often reflect important characteristics of the system .",
    "for instance , by monitoring the motion of probe particles , one can understand visco - elastic properties of a cell  @xcite , the sol - gel transition in a polymer solution  @xcite or correlations present in bacterial motion  @xcite . in certain cases , for example , in active micro - rheology ,",
    "the probe particles are subjected to external force fields . in  @xcite the forced dynamics of a magnetic bead in a dense colloidal suspension ,",
    "has been used to study the colloidal glass transition .    in this paper",
    "we will consider one such example of nonequilibrium ( driven ) probe particles which are introduced in a nonequilibrium medium , to study how the static and dynamic properties of the probe particles are influenced by the surrounding medium , and also how the medium gets affected by the presence of the probe particles .",
    "we study a particular simple one - dimensional lattice gas model first introduced in @xcite to describe the motion of probe particles in a current - carrying medium .",
    "the probe particles are taken to exchange with particles and holes of the medium with equal rates but in opposite directions .",
    "because of these dynamical rules , the probe particles tend to migrate towards the region of strong density variations ( or shocks ) which may be present in the system . studying the dynamics of these shock - tracking probe particles",
    ", one can therefore infer the motion of density fluctuations in the medium .    in an earlier study  @xcite",
    ", we have discussed the dynamical properties of these probe particles in a nonequilibrium current - carrying medium in which there is no interaction between medium particles except hard - core exclusion . in this case , the medium was described by an asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) which is the simplest lattice model of driven diffusive systems  @xcite .",
    "the shock - tracking probe particles then reduce to second class particles  @xcite .",
    "_ have found the exact stationary measure of the system  @xcite .",
    "their studies on static properties of the system show that when the number of second class particles is finite , they form a bound state and the steady state distribution function of the separation @xmath0 between a pair decays as @xmath1 with @xmath2 .",
    "a macroscopic number of second class particles gives rise to a correlation length which diverges ( proportional to the square of the interprobe separation ) , as the probe concentration goes to zero .",
    "we studied the dynamical properties of this system in presence of a macroscopic number of probe particles , and found that the dynamics is governed by a time - scale which marks the crossover from single - probe behavior to many - probe behavior  @xcite .",
    "this time - scale shows a strong divergence ( proportional to the cube of the interprobe separation ) in the limit of vanishingly small density of the probe particles .",
    "this diverging time - scale is related to the diverging correlation length present in the system  @xcite , and enters the scaling descriptions of various dynamical correlation functions of the probe particles  @xcite .    in the present paper , we present a detailed study of shock - tracking probes in a driven system",
    "in which there is a short - ranged ising interaction between the particles of the medium . in the absence of any probes ,",
    "such a medium can be described by the @xmath3-d katz - lebowitz - spohn ( kls ) model , whose steady state has an ising measure  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    "_ have reported that in presence of a macroscopic number of probe particles , the system shows an interesting phase transition as the strength of the ising interaction is varied . beyond a critical value of the interaction strength and for sufficiently high density of the medium ,",
    "a macroscopic domain consisting of particles and holes ( no probes ) is formed .",
    "a characterisation of this phase transition was attempted using an approximate mapping to the zero - range process ( zrp ) where the probes are mapped onto zrp sites and the particle - hole domain preceding a probe is mapped onto the occupancy of that site  @xcite .",
    "the current out of a particle - hole domain then becomes the hopping rate out of a site in the zrp .",
    "a prediction of this approximate mapping is that exponents characterizing the decays of several static and dynamic quantities should depend continuously on the ising interaction strength @xmath4 .",
    "however , our numerical studies of these quantities seem to indicate that the exponents are @xmath4-independent over a substantial range of @xmath4 . this paper is concerned with a study of the differences between our results and those based on the zrp picture .",
    "a possible simple rationalization of our results is that the ising interactions would be expected to give rise to a finite correlation length @xmath5 , whose value may be renormalized in the presence of probes , but is still expected to be finite .",
    "then , on length scales @xmath6 , the system should behave essentially like the non - interacting @xmath7 system .",
    "our results are indeed consistent with such a scenario , as we find @xmath4-independent behaviour asymptotically ( for large @xmath0 and @xmath8 ) , even though there is sometimes an @xmath4 dependence for smaller @xmath0 and @xmath8 .",
    "below we describe in brief the quantities we studied and our results .    1 .",
    "_ distribution function of the size of the particle - hole domains _ : the mapping to the zrp predicts that in the disordered phase this distribution function should be an exponential times a power law , with a power which is a continuous function of the ising interaction strength .",
    "however , we observe that the domain size distribution shows a power law exponent which does not vary with @xmath4 but remains constant at its value for @xmath9 . to understand this discrepancy ,",
    "we are led to check the assumptions that have been made in the approximate kls - zrp mapping .",
    "we find that the assumption of statistical independence of the domains remains valid , and further verify that accounting for the finite size correction to domain currents is not the reason behind the discrepancy .",
    "however , as we discuss in section @xmath10 , the movement of probes in a kls medium is non - markovian and the zrp mapping does not capture this aspect of probe dynamics .",
    "dynamics of two probe particles _ : this was studied in  @xcite where it was reported that a bound state forms between the probe pair such that the distribution of separation decays as a power law with an exponent @xmath11 that varies continuously with the strength of the ising interaction @xmath4 .",
    "starting from a configuration where the two probes were nearest neighbors , a scaling form was proposed to describe the temporal evolution of their separation .",
    "the authors have tried to verify this scaling form by measuring the cumulative distribution and the mean value of the separation between the probes as a function of time .",
    "they reported that in conformity with their scaling hypothesis , the time - dependent cumulative distribution function @xmath12 for different values of @xmath8 undergoes a scaling collapse when rescaled by @xmath13/z}$ ] and plotted against @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the dynamical exponent that takes the value @xmath16 .",
    "the average separation between the two probes is reported to grow with time as a power law with an exponent @xmath17/z$ ] , which is consistent with their scaling form . + on the contrary , we find that although for an initial time range , the average distance does show @xmath4-dependent growth , for larger times , it crosses over to another growth regime where the exponent takes a value which is close to the one expected for @xmath18 , _",
    "i.e. _ with no ising interaction .",
    "our numerical results also show that for larger times , the scaling collapse of @xmath12 fails .",
    "we have verified that the scaling collapse can be retrieved by rescaling with @xmath19 ( instead of @xmath13/z}$ ] ) , as in the case of @xmath20 .",
    "3 .   _ dynamical properties with a macroscopic number of probes _ :",
    "the dynamical correlation functions in this case are found to follow the same scaling description as with @xmath18 , with a crossover time - scale which separates a single - probe regime at short times from a long - time regime characterized by collective behaviour of the probes .",
    "moreover , the crossover time - scale shows a similar divergence in the limit of vanishingly low concentration of the probe particles . in other words ,",
    "our studies indicate that even in the presence of a nearest neighbor ising interaction in the medium , the large time and large distance properties of the system do not change .    in the following section ,",
    "we describe the lattice model on which we have performed monte carlo simulation and briefly summarise our earlier results for the non - interacting @xmath7 medium . in section @xmath10",
    "we discuss the static properties of this model where we recall the approximate mapping to the zero - range process ( zrp ) introduced in  @xcite and discuss the validity of various assumptions that went into this mapping . in section @xmath21 we discuss the dynamical properties of the system in presence of a finite number of probes and also for a finite density of the probes .",
    "the model is defined on a one dimensional periodic lattice each site of which may either be empty or may contain a particle of the medium or a probe .",
    "we use the symbol ` @xmath23 ' to denote a particle , ` @xmath24 ' to denote a hole and ` @xmath25 ' to denote a probe .",
    "the exchange rules are as follows .",

    ", we will only consider @xmath35 .    in the absence of any probes ,",
    "the system reduces to a @xmath3-d kls model with an ising measure in the steady state .",
    "this gives rise to an @xmath4-dependent correlation length @xmath5 in the system .",
    "for @xmath36 , this correlation length remains finite and hence the large distance properties of the system can be expected to remain unaffected by the interaction .    when probes are present , as seen from the last two exchange rules in eq .",
    "[ eq : klsrate ] , a probe exchanges with particles and holes of the medium in opposite directions .",
    "this implies that a probe would tend to be located in a position where there is an excess of holes to its left and an excess of particles to its right . in other words",
    ", there would be a strong density variation or ` shock ' around a probe .",
    "this is the reason we call them ` shock - tracking probes ' ( stps ) .    in the absence of any interaction",

    "a probe behaves like a particle for an adjacent hole , and like a hole for an adjacent particle .",

    "@xcite have found the exact steady state measure of this system of second class particles in an asep by using the matrix method . in presence of more than one second class particle ,",
    "the steady state factorises about any second class particle , which implies factorisation in terms of the one component system about the shock position . when there is a single second class particle present in the system , the mean density profile around it decays as a power law with an exponent @xmath39 . in the presence of two ( or a finite number of ) second class particles",
    ", the medium induces an attraction between them and they form a weakly bound state where the distance @xmath0 between two successive second class particles follows a power law distribution @xmath40 .",
    "when the number of second class particles is macroscopic , the density profile at a distance @xmath0 from any given probe takes the form @xmath41 where the correlation length @xmath42 diverges in the low concentration limit of the probes  @xcite : @xmath43    we monitored several quantities to study the dynamical properties of systems with macroscopic number of probes .",
    "we find a diverging time - scale which marks the crossover between single - probe behavior and many - probe behavior . in section iv",
    ", we will discuss the behaviour of these quantities , when @xmath4 is nonzero in the kls model .",
    "the variance of the displacement of the tagged probes is defined as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the position of the @xmath46-th probe at time @xmath8 .",
    "ferrari and fontes  @xcite had earlier calculated the asymptotic ( @xmath47 ) behavior of @xmath48 and shown that @xmath49 with diffusion constant @xmath50 /\\rho_0 $ ] . for small times , in the limit of low concentration of the probe particles , one would expect each probe to behave as an individual non - interacting particle subject only to the fluctuations of the medium .",
    "the variance of the displacement of a single probe is found analytically to grow as @xmath51  @xcite . in the limit of small but finite concentration of the probe particles @xmath48",
    "shows a single - particle ( super - diffusive ) behavior at small time and diffusive behavior at asymptotically large times .",
    "one would therefore expect a crossover between these two regimes that would occur at a time - scale @xmath52 which is a function of @xmath33 .",

    "the other ( simpler ) alternative is that @xmath185 and @xmath2 as in @xmath186 case .",
    "this scenario would explain the observed @xmath33 dependence of crossover time @xmath52 . in the case of two probes , the above value of @xmath187 is consistent with the large time growth exponent of the average separation @xmath134 between the probe pair ( shown in fig [ fig:2zrav ] ) and also with the linear growth of @xmath69 shown in the inset of fig [ fig : epdelta ] .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the dynamics of shock - tracking probe particles in a one - dimensional kls model of driven particles with nearest neighbor ising interaction @xmath4 . in particular , we have examined our results in the light of two different theoretical scenarios .",
    "the first scenario is based on an approximate mapping of the problem to a zero - range process , and leads to the conclusion that critical exponents characterizing power - law decays depend continuously on the strength of interaction , @xmath4 .",
    "the second scenario is based on the premise that since the correlations induced by ising interactions are short - ranged , asymptotic scaling properties which involve large distances and large times should be independent of @xmath4 , and the same as at @xmath9 .",
    "the results of our numerical studies on the dynamical properties of the probe particles lend support to the second scenario .",
    "we find that in presence of only two probe particles in the system , starting from a steady state configuration where the two probes were nearest neighbors , the average distance @xmath188 between them shows a crossover in time .",
    "for an initial time regime @xmath189 the growth is consistent with a power law with an @xmath4-dependent exponent @xmath17/z$ ]  @xcite .",
    "however , for large enough time , the growth occurs with an exponent @xmath133 , the value expected for a noninteracting medium , consistent with the second scenario discussed above .",
    "in addition , our study of the cumulative distribution of the probe - separation shows that for large time , the distribution function does not follow an @xmath4-dependent scaling form as claimed in  @xcite but can be described by a form expected for @xmath20 , which again supports the second scenario mentioned above .    for a small but finite density of the probes ,",
    "the dynamical correlation functions show a similar scaling form as for @xmath186  @xcite .",
    "these scaling forms involve a crossover time - scale @xmath52 that diverges for small @xmath33 as @xmath74 , as found for the non - interacting case  @xcite .",
    "we have seen that an @xmath4-dependent exponent @xmath11 would lead to an @xmath4-dependent dynamical exponent @xmath170 which may even become less than unity for larger values of @xmath4 .",
    "the other option , an @xmath4-independent dynamical exponent @xmath190 , is consistent with the second scenario outlined above , according to which , turning on a short - ranged ising interaction in the medium does not change the large time and large distance properties of the system .",
    "it is not yet completely clear why the kls - zrp mapping does not seem to yield results which agree with the numerical results .",
    "one possible reason is that the zrp mapping does not take into account the non - markovian movement of the probes .",
    "this lack of agreement also opens up the question of the nature of the complete phase diagram for the problem under study , including negative values of @xmath4 ?",
