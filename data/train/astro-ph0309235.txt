    "the extra - galactic distance scale is one of the key problems in modern astronomy .",
    "one of the basic parts of the solution is the correlation between period and mean luminosity ( pl ) obeyed by classical cepheids . the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) @xmath7 key project ( freedman et al .",
    "2001 , hereafter kp ) has used cepheids ( discovered either by ground - based telescopes or by _ hst _ ) in 31 spiral galaxies , with 18 of them observed originally by kp , and the pl relation to estimate the distances to these galaxies .",
    "these distances were then used in turn to calibrate a host of secondary distance indicators and hence estimate hubble s constant . in parallel with this a team led by sandage et al .",
    "( saha et al .",
    "2001b , hereafter sts ) has used the _",
    "hst _ to discover cepheids in spiral galaxies which host type ia supernovae .",
    "cepheid distances to these galaxies were used to calibrate the hubble diagram for type ia supernovae and hence estimate hubble s constant .    though both groups used mostly _ hst",
    "_ observations to discover the cepheids and similar methodologies , the kp team favor a short distance scale and a larger value of @xmath7 ( @xmath8 , freedman et al .",
    "@xcite ) whilst the sts group favor a long distance scale and smaller value of @xmath7 ( @xmath9 , saha et al .",
    "the discrepancy in the value of the hubble constant from these two groups is still unresolved ( e.g. , see hendry & kanbur @xcite ; beaulieu et al .",
    "@xcite ; kochanek @xcite ; sasselov et al . @xcite ; tanvir et al .",
    "@xcite ; caputo et al .",
    "@xcite ; gibson et al .",
    "@xcite ; gibson & stetson @xcite ) .",
    "it is due only in part to the cepheid distance scale .",
    "we note that the recent wmap results ( spergel et al .",
    "@xcite ) find a hubble constant very similar to the value obtained by kp .",
    "nevertheless it is still very instructive to discover the reason behind the discrepancies in the cepheid distance scale from the sts and kp groups .",
    "a proper understanding of the cepheid pl relation in this regard is very important for an accurate local distance scale . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on recalibrating the cepheid distance to the target galaxies in both kp and sts groups with existing data because of the following factors :    1 .",
    "_ hst _ cepheid data is sparsely sampled with typically 12 and 4 points per cepheid in the v and i band respectively ( see section 2 for details ) . in order to apply the cepheid pl relations",
    ", it is necessary to estimate the mean magnitudes from these data in both v and i bands . in this paper",
    ", we use the techniques of fourier expansion and interrelations to estimate the v and i mean magnitudes from sparsely populated light curves .",
    "these techniques are described in detail in ngeow et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "we re - analyze the ogle ( optical gravitational lensing experiment ) lmc cepheids ( udalski et al .",
    "@xcite ) on the basis of the quality of their @xmath10 band light curve , and develop more conservative lmc pl relations based on this analysis and investigate the sensitivity of extra - galactic cepheid distances to the lmc pl relation .",
    "this approach is different to the `` sigma - clipping '' methods currently used by udalski et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "3 .   the average value of metallicities , defined as @xmath11 , in target galaxies is about @xmath12 ( freedman et al .",
    "@xcite ) . this value is closer to the standard solar value of @xmath13 ( grevesse et al .",
    "@xcite ) than the lmc value of @xmath14 ( see reference in ferrarese et al .",
    "@xcite ) . therefore",
    ", another approach is to use galactic cepheid pl relations as fundamental calibrating relations ( feast @xcite ; tammann @xcite ; thim et al .",
    "@xcite ; fouqu et al .",
    "@xcite ) . we compare the distances obtained when using both the lmc and galactic pl relations",
    "kanbur & hendry ( @xcite ) building on the hydrodynamical models of simon et al .",
    "( @xcite ) suggested that pl relations at maximum light may be more accurate than pl(mean ) relations . to test this idea , we compute distances using pl(max ) relations and compare with their mean light counterparts .    in section 2",
    "we summarize the photometric data used in this study . in section 3 we present and discuss the methodology used in determining cepheid distances , including obtaining the v and i band means and applying different pl relations .",
    "the results will be presented in section 4 .",
    "the conclusion and the discussion will be presented in section 5 .",
    "the photometry data for the cepheids in each target galaxy were directly obtained from the corresponding published papers . we emphasize that we did not repeat the photometric reduction from raw data .",
    "the target galaxies that are selected in this study include : 16 kp galaxies , 8 sts galaxies and ngc 4258 , which has an accurate geometrical distance measurement from water maser studies ( herrnstein et al .",
    "@xcite , hereafter wm galaxy ) .",
    "the photometric data of 16 kp galaxies were directly downloaded from the kp web - page , excluding ngc 1425 ( the data is not available at the time of analysis ) and ngc 5457 ( m101 , as the observations to this galaxy include its outer field ( kelson et al .",
    "@xcite ) and inner field ( stetson et al .",
    "@xcite ) , which complicated the analysis ) .",
    "the photometric data for the sts and wm galaxies were taken from the sts papers ( see saha et al .",
    "@xcite for references for each target galaxy ) and newman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , respectively .",
    "the list of the target galaxies can be obtained from table [ tab2 ] .",
    "there are two major photometry reduction packages used in reducing the data for these galaxies , the allframe ( stetson @xcite ) and a variant of the dophot ( schechter et al .",
    "@xcite ; saha et al .",
    "@xcite ) package .",
    "the kp team utilized both packages as a double - blind reduction process ( kennicutt et al .",
    "@xcite ; freedman et al .",
    "@xcite ) to check the consistency between the two packages .",
    "however , the final , adopted distance moduli are based on allframe results ( freedman et al .",
    "inter - comparison of the results from these two packages ( galaxy - by - galaxy basis ) show good agreement between the two ( see the kp papers for more details and hill et al .",
    "we also use the allframe photometric data downloaded from their web - page ( if available )",
    ". however , the photometric data for ngc 2541 and ngc 4321 are only available in dophot from the same web - page .",
    "similarly , only the dophot photometric data is available for wm galaxy , although the photometry reductions were carried out by both packages ( newman et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    in contrast",
    ", the photometric data for the sts galaxies were reduced mainly with dophot , although some of the galaxies also used an additional reduction package to check the dophot results ( e.g. , reduction of ngc 4527 included the romafot package , see saha et al .",
    "@xcite ) . nevertheless , the available data for all sts galaxies are from the dophot package . although the kp team has reanalyzed the sts galaxies with the allframe package ( gibson et al .",
    "@xcite ; gibson & stetson @xcite ; stetson & gibson @xcite ; freedman et al .",
    "@xcite ) , these data are not yet available from the kp web - page ( as claimed in these papers ) .",
    "however , most , but not all , of the cepheids are common in both sts and kp results ( gibson et al .",
    "hence , we only can use the dophot results in our analysis of sts galaxies .",
    "the next steps in the photometric reduction process are a cepheid search and period determination .",
    "each reduction package has its own algorithms to perform the period search , and the results generally agree well .",
    "we use published cepheid data and periods in our analysis .",
    "the _ hst _ observations of the target galaxies generally consist of 24 v band and 8 i band cosmic - ray ( cr ) split images .",
    "the analysis of dophot and allframe treat these images differently to deal with the cosmic - ray and point - spread functions .",
    "however , most of the published photometry combined the back - to - back cr split images together and tabulated the averaged 12 v band and 4 i band data points .",
    "therefore , we only can use these ( reduced ) photometric data points to reconstruct the light curves and obtain the mean magnitudes by the fourier techniques described in the next section .",
    "the physical basis of cepheid pl relations and their usage in determining the distance have been covered extensively in the literature ( e.g. , see sandage & tammann @xcite ; feast & walker @xcite , madore & freedman @xcite ; freedman et al .",
    "@xcite ) and would not be repeated here , only a brief description will be presented .",
    "the application of the cepheid pl relation to estimate distances involves the discovery and appropriate observation of cepheids sufficient to estimate their periods ( in days ) and mean magnitudes . in order to correct for the extinction / reddening , observations of extra - galactic cepheids by _ hst _ are normally taken in bandpasses v and i. the pl relation in bandpass @xmath15 can be expressed as : @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the slope and zero - point , respectively . for the measurement of the apparent mean magnitudes of cepheids in a target galaxy , @xmath19 , the distance modulus in bandpass @xmath15",
    "is :          where @xmath23 is the ratio of total - to - selective absorption .",
    "following kp , we adopt @xmath24 from cardelli et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "note that the validity of equation ( 1 ) is based on the assumption that there are no correlated measurement errors in the v and i bandpasses . then any differences in the v and i band distance moduli are due to differential reddening ( see saha et al .",
    "@xcite for details ) .    after applying a period cut to the short period cepheids in target galaxies",
    "( to avoid the incompleteness bias at the faint - end of observations , see sandage @xcite ; lanoix et al .",
    "@xcite ; freedman et al .",
    "@xcite ) , an unweighted mean of apparent distance moduli to the remaining cepheids is adopted as the distance modulus to the target galaxy . the random ( or statistical ) error associated with equation ( 1 )",
    "can be calculated via the standard formulae ( i.e. @xmath25 ) .",
    "the reasons for taking the unweighted mean are : ( a ) the photometric errors of the mean magnitudes are smaller than the expected width of the instability strip , and are , together with other systematic errors , the dominant part of the weight in a weighted mean ( leonard et al .",
    "@xcite ) ; ( b ) this is equivalent to the fitting scheme used by kp ; and ( c ) it can be easily incorporated with the weighting scheme adopted by the sts group ( tanvir @xcite ) . finally , due to the possible metallicity dependence of the cepheid pl relation ( see the discussions and reference in , e.g. , kennicutt et al . @xcite ; freedman et al .",
    "@xcite ) , metallicity corrections are added to equation ( 1 ) :      where @xmath27_{ref}-[o / h]_{gal})$ ] with the usual definition of @xmath28\\equiv 12+\\log(o / h)$ ] .",
    "the reference metallicity , @xmath28_{ref}$ ] , is @xmath29 and @xmath30 for using lmc and galactic pl relations , respectively .",
    "some published values of @xmath5 range from @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( gould @xcite ) , @xmath33 ( beaulieu et al . @xcite ; sasselov et al .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath34 ( kochanek @xcite ) , @xmath35 ( freedman & madore @xcite ) , @xmath36 ( kennicutt et al .",
    "@xcite ) to @xmath37 ( caputo et al .",
    "@xcite ) . note that the value of @xmath5 is method - dependent , i.e. it depends on the bandpasses and calibrating pl relation adopted .",
    "for example , strictly speaking the metallicity dependence quoted in kennicutt et al .",
    "( @xcite ) is only applicable when the madore & freedman ( @xcite ) pl relation is used , and then only for the v and i bandpasses .",
    "although there is some debate on the value for @xmath5 ( see freedman et al .",
    "@xcite ; tammann et al .",
    "@xcite for details ) , we adopt @xmath38 as in kp , who note that this value is in the middle of a number of different determinations of @xmath5 .",
    "changes in metallicity affect the mean brightness of a cepheid and the papers quoted above were aimed at quantifying this brightness shift due to metallicity .",
    "however , we now know that the cepheid pl relation has a different slope in the galaxy and lmc , and indeed may have two different slopes in the lmc itself",
    ". thus it may be that metallicity affects not only the mean brightness of a cepheid but also the way that mean brightness changes with period ( the slope of the pl relation ) .",
    "we discuss this and its implications for metallicity corrections like equation ( 2 ) in section 5 .",
    "since we are using the published photometry data to calculate the distance modulus , we share the same systematic errors as in the published results . these include the uncertainty in the zero point of the pl relation , calibration of photometric zero points , reddening and metallicity effects , incompleteness bias and crowding .",
    "the order of a typical systematic error is around @xmath39 .",
    "as mentioned in section 2 , most of the _ hst _ observations of extra - galactic cepheids contain only 12 v band epochs and 4 ( or 5 ) i band epochs .",
    "these observations use a power - law time series sampling strategy to minimize the aliasing problem and maximize the phase coverage of the observed data points within the observing windows ( freedman et al .",
    "@xcite ; kennicutt et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in order to reduce the bias due to sampling procedures , sts and some early kp observations used phase - weighted intensity means to find mean magnitudes in the v band .",
    "the i band mean magnitudes were found via empirical relations developed by freedman ( @xcite ) and labhardt et al .",
    "( @xcite ) for kp and sts observations , respectively ( see , e.g. , silbermann et al .",
    "other kp observations used a template - fitting procedure ( stetson @xcite ) to obtain the mean magnitudes in both v and i band simultaneously .",
    "in addition to the methods mentioned , ngeow et al .",
    "( @xcite ) recently developed an alternative method to obtain the mean magnitudes , which is based on fourier techniques .",
    "ngeow et al .",
    "( @xcite ) give specific examples of situations when such a method could be preferable to template based techniques . another motivation for developing these fourier techniques",
    "is the possibility of reconstructing observed hst light curves to compare with models . in section 4.1 ,",
    "we quantitatively compare the means obtained using our methods with existing techniques in the literature .    here",
    ", we apply the new fourier method to all target galaxies in order to be consistent in doing the analysis , and also to test this new method in the distance scale problem .",
    "the details of using the fourier techniques are presented in ngeow et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . here",
    "we outline the steps :    1 .   _",
    "the v band _ : the light curves of 12 v band data points are reconstructed via a @xmath40-order fourier expansion with the form : @xmath41       \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] + where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are fourier amplitudes and phases , respectively , and @xmath44 is the mean magnitude . since the periods are directly taken from literature , the remaining nine parameters can be obtained by fitting the data with equation ( 3 ) .",
    "we use the technique of simulated annealing and restrict the ranges that the fourier parameters in equation ( 3 ) can take to reconstruct the v band light curves .",
    "the ranges of fourier phases are from @xmath45 to @xmath46 , whilst the ranges of fourier amplitudes are determined from the `` calibrating set '' cepheids and ogle lmc cepheids .",
    "the `` calibrating set '' cepheids consist of @xmath47100 galactic cepheids , mostly observed originally by moffett & barnes ( @xcite ) , and some lmc / smc cepheids .",
    "the i band _ : for 4 i band data points , it is clear that equation ( 3 ) can not be applied to reconstruct the i band light curves .",
    "therefore , we use fourier interrelations ( ngeow et al .",
    "@xcite ) to reconstruct the i band light curves .",
    "the fourier interrelations are linear relations connecting the fourier parameters in the v and i bands : + @xmath48 + the coefficients in equation ( 4 ) are determined from the `` calibrating set '' cepheids .",
    "ngeow et al .",
    "( @xcite ) developed such fourier interrelations for the galaxy , lmc and smc separately and found that they are only weakly dependent on metallicity .",
    "this is important since it means that the interrelations can be applied over a wide range of metallicity .",
    "given the solution of equation ( 4 ) , the observed i band points are then used to establish the i band light curves and hence estimate the corresponding mean magnitudes by minimizing the chi - square .",
    "these fourier techniques have been tested with monte carlo simulations , and show that the reconstruction procedures are unbiased and the errors of the fourier amplitudes and means are around @xmath49 .",
    "although the filters installed on the _ hst _ are close to the standard johnson and kron - cousins system , i.e. @xmath50 and @xmath51 , conversions from the _ hst _ passbands to the standard photometry systems have been used by both kp and sts teams . for the case of the allframe photometry reduction in the kp galaxies ,",
    "the conversions are made during the reductions with the formulae suggested by holtzman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , hence the published photometry of the cepheids are in standard bands .",
    "a similar situation regarding the conversion holds for the two kp galaxies with dophot photometry ( ngc 2541 & ngc 4321 ) and the wm galaxy . for sts galaxies with dophot photometric reductions ,",
    "the conversions are applied after the reductions to the calculated mean magnitudes ( see equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) in saha et al .",
    "@xcite for wfpc ; and equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) in saha et al .",
    "@xcite for wfpc2 ) . in the case of pl(max ) relations , however , no such conversion is available yet .",
    "we have to assume the conversions at maximum light are similar to the equations given by saha et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , and apply the conversion accordingly .",
    "these conversions have been applied to sts galaxies in table [ tab3a ] , [ tab3b ] & [ tab3c ] .",
    "the derived mean magnitudes in both v and i bands for the cepheids used in this study are listed in table [ taballmag ] , where column 1 shows the cepheid in the target galaxy , column 2 is the period adopted from the literature , and columns 3 and 4 are the mean v and i band magnitudes , respectively , derived from the fourier techniques described in this paper . table [ taballmag ] is available in its complete electronic form at the cds .",

    "<S> in this paper , we recalibrate the cepheid distance to some nearby galaxies observed by the _ hst _ key project and the sandage - tammann - saha group . </S>",
    "<S> we use much of the key project methodology in our analysis but apply new techniques , based on fourier methods to estimate the mean of a sparsely sampled cepheid light curve , to published extra - galactic cepheid data . </S>",
    "<S> we also apply different calibrating pl relations to estimate cepheid distances , and investigate the sensitivity of the distance moduli to the adopted calibrating pl relation . </S>",
    "<S> we re - determine the ogle lmc pl relations using a more conservative approach and also study the effect of using galactic pl relations on the distance scale .    </S>",
    "<S> for the key project galaxies after accounting for charge transfer effects , we find good agreement with an average discrepancy of -0.002 and 0.075@xmath0 when using the lmc and galaxy , respectively , as a calibrating pl relation . for ngc 4258 which has a geometric distance of @xmath1 , we find a distance modulus of @xmath2 , after correcting for metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> in addition we have calculated the cepheid distance to 8 galaxies observed by the sandage - tammann - saha group and find shorter distance moduli by @xmath3 ( mainly due to the use of different lmc pl relations ) and @xmath4 on average again when using the lmc and galaxy , respectively , as a calibrating pl relation . </S>",
    "<S> however care must be taken to extrapolate these changed distances to changes in the resulting values of the hubble constant because sts also use distances to ngc 3368 and 4414 and because sts calibration of sn ia is often decoupled from the distance to the host galaxy through their use of differential extinction arguments . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate the distance to all these galaxies using pl relations at maximum light and find very good agreement with mean light pl distances .    </S>",
    "<S> however , after correcting for metallicity effects , the difference between the distance moduli obtained using the two sets of calibrating pl relations becomes negligible . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that cepheids in the lmc and galaxy do follow different pl relations and constrains the sign for the coefficient of the metallicity correction , @xmath5 , to be negative , at least at the median period @xmath6 , of the target galaxies . </S>"
