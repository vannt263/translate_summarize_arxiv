    "this is the seventh part of our eight presentations in which we consider applications of methods from wavelet analysis to nonlinear accelerator physics problems .",
    "this is a continuation of our results from [ 1]-[8 ] , in which we considered the applications of a number of analytical methods from nonlinear ( local ) fourier analysis , or wavelet analysis , to nonlinear accelerator physics problems both general and with additional structures ( hamiltonian , symplectic or quasicomplex ) , chaotic , quasiclassical , quantum .",
    "wavelet analysis is a relatively novel set of mathematical methods , which gives us a possibility to work with well - localized bases in functional spaces and with the general type of operators ( differential , integral , pseudodifferential ) in such bases .",
    "in contrast with parts 14 in parts 58 we try to take into account before using power analytical approaches underlying algebraical , geometrical , topological structures related to kinematical , dynamical and hidden symmetry of physical problems .",
    "we described a number of concrete problems in parts 14 .",
    "the most interesting case is the dynamics of spin - orbital motion ( part 4 ) . in section 2",
    "we consider dynamical consequences of covariance properties regarding to relativity ( kinematical ) groups and continuous wavelet transform ( cwt ) ( in section 3 ) as a method for the solution of dynamical problems .",
    "we introduce the semidirect product structure , which allows us to consider from general point of view all relativity groups such as euclidean , galilei , poincare .",
    "then we consider the lie - poisson equations and obtain the manifestation of semiproduct structure of ( kinematic ) symmetry group on dynamical level .",
    "so , correct description of dynamics is a consequence of correct understanding of real symmetry of the concrete problem .",
    "we consider the lagrangian theory related to semiproduct structure and explicit form of variation principle and corresponding ( semidirect ) euler - poincare equations . in section 3",
    "we consider cwt and the corresponding analytical technique which allows to consider covariant wavelet analysis . in part 8",
    "we consider in the particular case of affine galilei group with the semiproduct structure the corresponding orbit technique for constructing different types of invariant wavelet bases .",
    "relativity groups such as euclidean , galilei or poincare groups are the particular cases of semidirect product construction , which is very useful and simple general construction in the group theory [ 9 ] .",
    "we may consider as a basic example the euclidean group @xmath0 , the semidirect product of rotations and translations .",
    "in general case we have @xmath1 , where group g ( lie group or automorphisms group ) acts on a vector space v and on its dual @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath3 be a vector space and @xmath4 is the lie group , which acts on the left by linear maps on v ( g also acts on the left on its dual space @xmath2 ) .",
    "the lie algebra of s is the semidirect product lie algebra , @xmath5 with brackets @xmath6=([\\xi_1,\\xi_2],\\xi_1v_2-\\xi_2v_1 ) , $ ] where the induced action of @xmath7 by concatenation is denoted as @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 denote the induced left action of @xmath14 on @xmath15 ( the left action of g on v induces a left action on @xmath2  the inverse of the transpose of the action on v ) , @xmath16 is a linear map given by @xmath17 , @xmath18 is its dual .",
    "then adjoint and coadjoint actions are given by simple concatenation : @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "also , let be @xmath21 for @xmath22 , which is a bilinear operation in @xmath23 and @xmath15 .",
    "so , we have the coadjoint action : @xmath24 using concatenation notation for lie algebra actions we have alternative definition of @xmath25 . for all @xmath26 , @xmath22 , @xmath27",
    "we have @xmath28 .",
    "now we consider the manifestation of semiproduct structure of symmetry group on dynamical level .",
    "let @xmath29 be real valued functions on the dual space @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "functional derivative of f at @xmath32 is the unique element @xmath33 : @xmath34 for all @xmath35 , @xmath36 is pairing between @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "define the @xmath39 lie - poisson brackets by @xmath40 the lie - poisson equations , determined by @xmath41 or intrinsically @xmath42 for the left representation of g on v @xmath43 lie - poisson bracket of two functions @xmath44 is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 are the functional derivatives of f. the hamiltonian vector field of @xmath48 has the expression @xmath49 thus , hamiltonian equations on the dual of a semidirect product are [ 9 ] : @xmath50 so , we can see the explicit contribution to the poisson brackets and the equations of motion which come from the semiproduct structure .",
    "now we consider according to [ 9 ] lagrangian side of a theory .",
    "this approach is based on variational principles with symmetry and is not dependent on hamiltonian formulation , although it is demonstrated in [ 9 ] that this purely lagrangian formulation is equivalent to the hamiltonian formulation on duals of semidirect product ( the corresponding legendre transformation is a diffeomorphism ) .",
    "we consider the case of the left representation and the left invariant lagrangians ( @xmath51 and l ) , which depend in additional on another parameter @xmath22 ( dynamical parameter ) , where v is representation space for the lie group g and l has an invariance property related to both arguments .",
    "it should be noted that the resulting equations of motion , the euler - poincare equations , are not the euler - poincare equations for the semidirect product lie algebra @xmath52 or @xmath53 .",
    "so , we have the following :    * 1 .",
    "* there is a left representation of lie group g on the vector space v and g acts in the natural way on the left on @xmath54 .",
    "the function @xmath55 is the left g - invariant . *",
    "* let @xmath56 , lagrangian @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath59 is left invariant under the lift to tg of the left action of @xmath60 on g , where @xmath60 is the isotropy group of @xmath61 .",
    "left g - invariance of l permits us to define @xmath62 by @xmath63 this relation defines for any @xmath62 the left g - invariant function @xmath64 .",
    "* for a curve @xmath65 let be @xmath66 and define the curve @xmath67 as the unique solution of the following linear differential equation with time dependent coefficients @xmath68 with initial condition @xmath69 .",
    "the solution can be written as @xmath70",
    ".    then we have four equivalent descriptions of the corresponding dynamics : * 1 . *",
    "if @xmath61 is fixed then hamilton s variational principle @xmath71 holds for variations @xmath72 of @xmath73 vanishing at the endpoints .",
    "* @xmath73 satisfies the euler - lagrange equations for @xmath59 on g. * 3 . *",
    "the constrained variational principle @xmath74 holds on @xmath75 , using variations of @xmath76 and @xmath15 of the form @xmath77 $ ] , @xmath78 , where @xmath79 vanishes at the endpoints . *",
    "the euler - poincare equations hold on @xmath75 @xmath80 so , we may apply our wavelet methods either on the level of variational formulation or on the level of euler - poincare equations .",
    "now we need take into account the hamiltonian or lagrangian structures related with systems ( 2 ) or ( 3 ) .",
    "therefore , we need to consider generalized wavelets , which allow us to consider the corresponding structures instead of compactly supported wavelet representation from parts 1 - 4 . in wavelet analysis",
    "the following three concepts are used now : 1 ) .  a square integrable representation @xmath81 of a group @xmath4 , 2 ) .  coherent states ( cs ) over g , 3 ) .",
    "the wavelet transform associated to u. we consider now their unification [ 10]-[12 ] .",
    "let @xmath4 be a locally compact group and @xmath82 strongly continuous , irreducible , unitary representation of g on hilbert space @xmath83 .",
    "let @xmath84 be a closed subgroup of @xmath4 , @xmath85 with ( quasi ) invariant measure @xmath86 and @xmath87 is a borel section in a principal bundle @xmath88 .",
    "then we say that @xmath81 is square integrable @xmath89 if there exists a non - zero vector @xmath90 such that @xmath91 @xmath92 .",
    "given such a vector @xmath90 called admissible for @xmath93 we define the family of ( covariant ) coherent states or wavelets , indexed by points @xmath94 , as the orbit of @xmath95 under @xmath4 , though the representation @xmath81 and the section @xmath96 [ 10]-[12 ] : @xmath97 .",
    "so , coherent states or wavelets are simply the elements of the orbit under u of a fixed vector @xmath95 in representation space .",
    "we have the following fundamental properties : * 1.*overcompleteness : the set @xmath98 is total in @xmath99 .",
    "* resolution property : the square integrability condition may be represented as a resolution relation : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is a bounded , positive operator with a densely defined inverse .",
    "define the linear map @xmath102 then the range @xmath103 of @xmath104 is complete with respect to the scalar product @xmath105 and @xmath104 is unitary operator from @xmath83 onto @xmath106 .",
    "@xmath104 is continuous wavelet transform ( cwt ) . *",
    "reproducing kernel . the orthogonal projection from @xmath107 onto @xmath106 is an integral operator @xmath108 and @xmath103 is a reproducing kernel hilbert space of functions : @xmath109 the kernel is given explicitly by @xmath110 , if @xmath111 , @xmath112 .",
    "so , the function @xmath113 is a wavelet transform ( wt ) iff it satisfies this reproducing relation .",
    "* reconstruction formula .",
    "the wt @xmath104 may be inverted on its range by the adjoint operator , @xmath114 on @xmath106 to obtain for @xmath115 , @xmath116 @xmath117 this is inverse wt .",
    "if @xmath118 is bounded then @xmath98 is called a frame , if @xmath119 then @xmath98 is called a tight frame .",
    "this two cases are generalization of a simple case , when @xmath98 is an ( ortho)basis .",
    "the most simple cases of this construction are : + * 1 . *",
    "this is the standard construction of wt over a locally compact group .",
    "it should be noted that the square integrability of u is equivalent to u belonging to the discrete series .",
    "the most simple example is related to the affine @xmath121 group and yields the usual one - dimensional wavelet analysis @xmath122(x)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}f\\left(\\frac{x - b}{a}\\right).$ ] for @xmath123 , the similitude group of the plane , we have the corresponding two - dimensional wavelets .",
    "@xmath124 , the isotropy ( up to a phase ) subgroup of @xmath95 : this is the case of the gilmore - perelomov cs .",
    "some cases of group g are : * a ) .",
    "* semisimple groups , such as su(n ) , su(n@xmath125 m ) , su(p , q ) , sp(n,*r * ) . *",
    "the weyl - heisenberg group @xmath126 which leads to the gabor functions , i.e. canonical ( oscillator)coherent states associated with windowed fourier transform or gabor transform ( see also part 6 ) : @xmath127(x)=\\exp(i\\mu(\\varphi - p(x - q))f(x - q)$ ] . in this case h is the center of @xmath126 . in both cases time - frequency plane",
    "corresponds to the phase space of group representation .",
    "* the similitude group sim(n ) of @xmath128 : for @xmath129 we have the axisymmetric n - dimensional wavelets . *",
    "* also we have the case of bigger group , containing both affine and weyl - heisenberg group , which interpolate between affine wavelet analysis and windowed fourier analysis : affine weyl ",
    "heisenberg group [ 12 ] . *",
    "* relativity groups . in a nonrelativistic setup ,",
    "the natural kinematical group is the ( extended ) galilei group .",
    "also we may adds independent space and time dilations and obtain affine galilei group . if we restrict the dilations by the relation @xmath130 , where @xmath131 are the time and space dilation we obtain the galilei - schrdinger group , invariance group of both schrdinger and heat equations .",
    "we consider these examples in the next section . in the same way we may consider as kinematical group the poincare group .",
    "when @xmath132 we have affine poincare or weyl - poincare group . some useful generalization of that affinization construction we consider for the case of hidden metaplectic structure in part 6 .",
    "but the usual representation is not square  integrable and must be modified : restriction of the representation to a suitable quotient space of the group ( the associated phase space in our case ) restores square  integrability : @xmath133 homogeneous space .",
    "our goal is applications of these results to problems of hamiltonian dynamics and as consequence we need to take into account symplectic nature of our dynamical problem .",
    "also , the symplectic and wavelet structures must be consistent ( this must be resemble the symplectic or lie - poisson integrator theory ) .",
    "we use the point of view of geometric quantization theory ( orbit method ) instead of harmonic analysis . because of this we can consider ( a )  ( e ) analogously .",
    "in next part we consider construction of invariant bases .",
