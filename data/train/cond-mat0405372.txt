    "since a pioneering demonstration of a single atomic switch by eigler _ et al._,@xcite in which high and low current state are realized via controlling xe atom transfer between a ni substrate and a tip of scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) , there have been very exciting developments in the unique ability of stm to induce the motions and reactions of single adsorbates at surfaces .",
    "examples of such novel experiments are dissociation of decaborane on si(111),@xcite desorption of hydrogen from hydrogen - terminated si(100),@xcite a step - by - step control of chemical reaction to form a biphenyl molecule from a iodobenzene on cu(111),@xcite rotation and dissociation of an oxygen molecule on pt(111),@xcite rotation of acetylene molecule on cu ( 100),@xcite hopping of co on pd(110),@xcite and hopping and desorption of ammonia on cu(100).@xcite    the theoretical understanding of the physical mechanisms behind these motions and reactions of single adsorbates has made a slow but steady progress toward a full understanding of how tunneling electrons couple to nuclear motion of an adsorbate to overcome the potential barrier along the relevant reaction coordinate .",
    "the power - law dependence of the atom transfer rate as a function of applied voltage or tunneling current observed for the eigler switch has been modelled as a potential barrier crossing between the potential wells formed by the interaction of the the adatom with the tip and the substrate , respectively .",
    "the atom overcomes the potential barrier through the stepwise vibrational ladder climbing by inelastic tunneling electrons .",

    "@xcite the coherent multiple excitation mechanism was shown to be important at low tunneling currents , where the average time between successive electrons is longer than the vibrational lifetime .",
    "dissociation rate of single o@xmath3 on pt(111 ) , where the vibrational relaxation rate of the o - o stretch mode due to electron - hole pair excitations in the substrate is much larger than the tunneling current,@xcite has been satisfactory described by this coherent multiple excitation process.@xcite however , one should bear in mind that since both coherent and incoherent multiple excitation mechanisms show a power - law dependence over a limited range of the bias voltage or the tunneling current , they can not be simply distinguished .",
    "recently we have developed  @xcite a theory of vibrational tunneling spectroscopy of adsorbates on metal surfaces using the keldysh - green s function method  @xcite for an adsorbate - induced resonance model proposed by persson and baratoff.@xcite this has enabled us to elucidate the elementary processes of electron transport via adsorbate state , and to obtain general formulae for the elastic and inelastic electron tunneling ( iet ) , and the effective vibrational distribution function within the second - order perturbation over the electron - phonon interaction of adsorbates . in comparison with the earlier papers,@xcite where the keldysh formalism was used as well , we take into account self - consistently the effects of the finite vibration lifetime on the iet spectra as well as on the vibration generation rate .    in this work a relation between the iet current and vibrational generation rate is studied using the coupled dyson and kinetic equations for causal and statistical phonon keldysh - green s functions .",
    "the stationary nonequilibrium phonon distribution function characterized by the current - driven vibrational generation rate and the vibrational relaxation rate allows us to introduce the effective temperature and to describe self - consistently the iet - induced vibrational heating .",
    "a primary interest is focused on the vicinity and below the threshold of the vibrational excitation .",
    "this situation was not investigated in refs .  , where the limit of large applied voltage was considered , @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is the vibrational mode energy ) . as we show , the dependencies of the vibrational generation rate and of the multi - step adsorbate excitation rates on the bias voltage deviate from simple power laws due to the effects of bath temperature and a finite lifetime of the vibrational mode excited by tunneling electrons . whereas the bath temperature broadening is restricted to a narrow region within several @xmath0 , the vibrational lifetime broadening causes a strong overheating effect in a much wider bias voltage region below the iet threshold .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : theory ] the general formulation of the problem in terms of keldysh - green s functions is outlined , and the kinetic equation for vibrational excitation is derived . in section [ sec : phgenrate ] we analyze the expressions for the iet vibrational generation rates and iet current .",

    "<S> we analyse theoretically a relation between the vibrational generation rate of a single adsorbate by tunneling electrons and the inelastic tunneling ( iet ) current in scanning tunneling microscope , and the influence of the vibrational excitations on the rate of adsorbate motions . </S>",
    "<S> special attention is paid to the effects of finite lifetime of the vibrational excitations . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in the vicinity and below the iet threshold the rate of adsorbate motion deviates from a simple power - law dependence on the bias voltage due to the effects of bath temperature and adsorbate vibrational lifetime broadenings . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature broadening appears to be confined near the threshold voltage within a narrow region of several @xmath0 , whereas the lifetime broadening manifests itself in a much wider region of applied voltages below the iet threshold . </S>"
