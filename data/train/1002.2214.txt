    "radiation and turbulent energies are different from those in the regions that form lower mass stars such as the sun .",
    "specifically , young stars more massive than 8 solar masses ( @xmath3 ) have a radiation pressure that would be sufficient to halt infall and prevent the accretion of additional mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "still , stars more massive than 200 @xmath3 have been observed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating that the processes governing massive star - formation are yet poorly understood .    a number of different formation scenarios have been proposed @xcite .",
    "these include formation through the merger of less massive stars @xcite or through the accretion of unbound gas from the molecular cloud , the competitive accretion theory @xcite . in the third scenario , core accretion @xcite , massive stars form through gravitational collapse , which involves disc - assisted accretion to overcome radiation pressure .",
    "this scenario is similar to the favored picture of low - mass star - formation @xcite , in which magnetic fields are thought to play an important role by removing excess angular momentum , thereby allowing accretion to continue onto the star @xcite .",
    "however , the accretion rates during massive star - formation are significantly higher than during the formation of a low - mass star , and it is unclear whether massive accretion discs are able to sustain these rates without support by strong magnetic fields @xcite . still , if such magnetized discs exist around massive protostars , outflows will arise as a natural consequence @xcite .    current observations of magnetic fields in massive star formation regions are often limited to low density regions ( hydrogen number density @xmath4@xmath5 ) and/or envelopes at scales of several 1000  au .",
    "linear polarization observations of dust also only provide information on the magnetic field in the plane of the sky , so they have been yet unable to probe the strength and the full structure of the magnetic field close to the protostar and around protostellar discs .",
    "recent high - angular - resolution submillimeter dust polarization observations of the massive hot molecular core g31.41 + 0.31 indicate that the gravitational collapse shows signs of being controlled by the magnetic field scales of @xmath6  au @xcite .",
    "currently , the only probes of magnetic fields in the high density regions close to the massive protostars are masers .",
    "because of their compactness and high brightness , masers are specifically suited for high angular resolution observations of weak linear and circular polarization and can thus be used to determine the magnetic field strength and morphology down to au scales ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the non - detection of the @xmath26  percent circular polarization observed for the 6.7-ghz methanol masers using the effelsberg 100-m telescope @xcite is unsurprising considering the rms noise limits of our circular polarization observations ( @xmath27 percent ) .",
    "maser theory describes that the fractional linear polarization @xmath28 of the non - paramagnetic maser species such as h@xmath7o , sio and ch@xmath11oh , depends on the degree of maser saturation and the angle @xmath29 between the maser propagation direction and the magnetic field .",
    "additionally , the relation between the measured polarization angle @xmath13 and the magnetic field angle on the sky @xmath30 also depends on @xmath29 , with the polarization vectors generally parallel to the field for @xmath31 and perpendicular to the field for @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "however , non - magnetic effects , such as full maser saturation and anisotropic maser pumping , can generate enhanced linear polarization and can rotate the polarization vectors with respect to the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "thus , before we can use polarization observations to determine the magnetic field morphology , we need to estimate the level at which these effects influence our measurements .",
    "the rotation and generation of linear polarization depends on the amount of zeeman - splitting and the level of maser saturation described by the zeeman frequency shift @xmath33 , the maser decay rate @xmath34 and the stimulated emission rate @xmath35 . when @xmath36 , the linear polarization direction is determined by the magnetic field , even in the presence of anisotropic pumping .",
    "when the effect of anisotropic pumping is not significant , even @xmath37 is a sufficient condition @xcite .",
    "the maser stimulated emission rate is given by : @xmath38 here @xmath39 is the einstein coefficient for the maser transition , which is equal to @xmath40  s@xmath9 , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the boltzmann and planck constants respectively .",

    "we measure @xmath46  k for our masers assuming that they are almost resolved with the merlin beam of @xmath47  mas .",
    "however , when observed at even higher angular resolution , more typical sizes are of the order of a few mas and brightness temperatures reach of order @xmath48  k @xcite .",
    "the beaming angle @xmath45 can not easily be measured directly .",
    "still , those of h@xmath7o masers in star - forming regions are shown to be @xmath49 @xcite , while those in the envelopes of evolved stars are of order @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "it is likely that methanol masers have similar beaming angles .",
    "taking @xmath51 as a conservative upper limit , the maser stimulated emission rate @xmath52  s@xmath9 .    the maser decay rate @xmath34 is more difficult to determine . for maser transitions involved infrared pumping , which includes methanol , @xmath53  s@xmath9 @xcite",
    "however , infrared trapping can reduce this value , although likely not by more than an order of magnitude @xcite . alternatively , when the maser transition involves collisions , @xmath54  s@xmath9 , with @xmath55 the hydrogen number density in @xmath5 . for the methanol masers this would imply @xmath56  s@xmath9",
    "however , as the collisional decay rate is smaller than the radiative decay rate , the radiative decay rate determined @xmath34 .",
    "we thus assume @xmath57  s@xmath9 , though other authors have assumed the lower value of @xmath58  s@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "we have thus shown that even with conservative estimates for @xmath35 and @xmath34 , we are in the regime where @xmath59 .",
    "however , we need to asses if @xmath33 is sufficiently much larger than @xmath35 and @xmath34 so that , even in the case of anisotropic pumping , the polarization vectors can be used to determine the magnetic field direction",
    ". the analysis by @xcite indicates that the effect of anisotropic pumping decreases significantly for transitions with high angular momentum , such as the 6.7-ghz methanol masers .",
    "this is further confirmed by the fact that we do not observe any relation between the maser total intensity and fractional polarization , which would be expected when non - magnetic effects contribute to the polarization .",
    "however , even without having to consider anisotropic pumping , the quantization axis of the maser is potentially not sufficiently determined by the magnetic field when @xmath33 is not significantly larger than @xmath35 and @xmath34 . for a magnetic field strength of @xmath60",
    "mg in the cepheus  a methanol maser region @xcite , @xmath61  s@xmath9 .",
    "although the uncertainty on the magnetic field determination was estimated to be of order @xmath62  percent , the limit of @xmath63  mg assumes a magnetic field along the maser line of sight and the true magnetic field , and consequently @xmath33 , will thus likely be larger .",
    "@xcite found that , for a ratio @xmath64 and @xmath65 , the relation between polarization angle and magnetic field direction hold to within @xmath66 .",
    "this improves quickly to better than @xmath67 when @xmath68 becomes larger .",
    "we are thus in the regime where the polarization vectors directly determine the magnetic field direction , but adopt an additional @xmath69 uncertainty in our determinations of the magnetic field direction on the plane of the sky .    for h@xmath7o masers",
    "it has been shown to be possible to estimate the saturation level , as determined by the emerging brightness temperature @xmath70 , and the intrinsic maser line - width @xmath71 by fitting both the total intensity and linear polarization maser spectra @xcite . as @xmath70 determines the relation between @xmath28 and @xmath29 we are then able to constrain @xmath29 using the measured @xmath28 and thus provide the full 3-dimensional magnetic field direction .",

    "the overall magnetic field orientation angle corresponds closely to the magnetic field direction observed in the encompassing dust envelope @xcite .",
    "the discrepant polarization angle found on the mid - plane maser feature is either due to the twisting of magnetic field lines towards the disc , or due to faraday rotation caused by the ionized outflow . while the methanol masers at 6.7-ghz are not significantly affected by interstellar faraday rotation , an electron density of @xmath8200 @xmath5 along a short 100 au path through the ionized outflow with a few mg magnetic field can cause the observed polarization angle of the masers behind the outflow to rotate by more than 10@xmath88 .",

    ", this will allow for a direct comparison between the magnetic field structure determined from the masers and the continuum morphology .",
    "single track observations will allow for mapping of massive star forming regions at different evolutionary stages down to a continuum sensitivity approaching @xmath161  @xmath162jy  beam@xmath9 .",
    "simultaneously , the sensitivity in a narrow 6.7-ghz maser frequency band will then be sufficient to detect linear polarization for @xmath163  percent of the star forming regions with methanol masers when assuming the flux analysis of @xcite .",
    "when analyzed in a similar way to the cepheus  a  hw2 observations presented here , such observations have the potential to significantly further our understanding of the magnetic field around massive protostars .",
    "we have demonstrated the power of maser polarization observation , and particularly those using methanol masers , in deducing the full 3-dimensional strength and structure of the magnetic field around massive protostars .",
    "the detection of a coherent magnetic field direction in maser features that individually have a size of a few au , suggests that the masers do not probe isolated pockets of a shock compressed magnetic field . in that case , the polarization direction would be determined by the direction of compression for each maser individually and observing coherent polarization angles would be unlikely .",
    "a similar conclusion could be drawn from recent observations of w75n at high angular resolution with the evn that reveal a uniform magnetic field direction in individual methanol maser features spread over @xmath164  au @xcite .",
    "the detection of a large scale magnetic field is further confirmed by the good agreement of the field direction with that determined using dust polarization observations of the entire cepheus a region . the 3-dimensional magnetic field geometry around cepheus a hw2 supports the theories in which magnetic fields regulate the infall and outflow close to massive protostars in a similar way as during low - mass star - formation , even if the high - mass star - forming regions are considerably more complex .",
    "the strong magnetic field that appears to be threading the disc will play a crucial role in maintaining the high accretion rate needed during massive star - formation and is potentially essential in maintaining disc stability and creating the conditions to allow for planet formation @xcite .",

    "<S> we find that the magnetic field is predominantly aligned along the protostellar outflow and perpendicular to the molecular and dust disc . from the three - dimensional magnetic field orientation and measurements of the magnetic field strength along the line of sight , </S>",
    "<S> we are able to determine that the high density material , in which the masers occurs , is threaded by a large scale magnetic field of @xmath0  mg . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the protostellar environment at @xmath1  au from cepheus  a  hw2 is slightly supercritical ( @xmath2 ) and the relation between density and magnetic field is consistent with collapse along the magnetic field lines . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the observations indicate that the magnetic field likely regulates accretion onto the disc . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field dominates the turbulent energies by approximately a factor of three and is sufficiently strong to be the crucial component stabilizing the massive accretion disc and sustaining the high accretion rates needed during massive star - formation .    </S>",
