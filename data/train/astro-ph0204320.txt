    "millisecond oscillations have been observed during thermonuclear x - ray bursts from nine neutron stars in low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ; see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "the bursts are triggered by the unstable nuclear burning of accreted material on the neutron star s surface ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "it therefore has long been expected that anisotropies in the burning should produce pulsations at the stellar spin frequency ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . indeed",
    ", the general characteristics of the observed oscillations suggest that they originate from a brightness anisotropy on the stellar surface .",
    "first , the oscillations are highly coherent towards the end of the burst @xcite .",
    "second , the oscillations are frequently observed in the rise of bursts , when there is spectral evidence for a growing burning region @xcite .",
    "third , the frequencies of these oscillations are remarkably similar in bursts separated by several years @xcite , which suggests that they originate from a stable clock .    if the burst oscillation frequency , @xmath2 , is indeed the spin frequency of the neutron star , the oscillations are key to understanding several aspects of these systems .",
    "pairs of kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( khz qpos ) are observed in the persistent emission from many neutron star lmxbs .",
    "their frequency difference @xmath3 remains comparable to @xmath4 or @xmath5 , even though the frequencies of the khz qpos vary by more than a factor of 2 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "it has been suggested that these qpos result from signals at a keplerian frequency in the disk and a beat between that frequency and the spin of the neutron star @xcite . and",
    "@xmath6 ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "] if this is the case , we can infer the rotation rate of the neutron stars in more than 20 systems @xcite .",
    "the inferred spin frequencies cluster around @xmath7  hz .",
    "this confirms the suggestion that these neutron star lmxbs are the progenitors of recycled millisecond radio pulsars @xcite .",
    "however , it also implies that some mechanism limits the frequencies to which these stars can be spun - up by accretion , such as a correlation between the surface magnetic field strength and x - ray luminosity @xcite or gravitational radiation from a quadrupole in the mass distribution of the star @xcite .",
    "a closer examination of these burst oscillations reveals an even more complex picture ( see also * ? ? ? * for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "first , the coherence of the oscillations is cast into some doubt by the detection of a sudden 0.25 cycle phase shift in one oscillation out of seven studied by @xcite .",
    "second , oscillations are not only observed in the rise of thermonuclear bursts , but also far into the decay ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , even though by this time the fuel over the entire surface of the neutron star is expected to have been consumed by the burning front leaving no observable brightness anisotropies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "third , while the spin of the neutron star must be constant during the course of a burst , the frequency of the oscillations is usually observed to increase and saturate at some maximum frequency @xcite .",
    "it is this `` asymptotic '' frequency that appears stable in bursts separated by several years .",
    "the frequency drift is thought to originate from one of several mechanisms that might carry anisotropies in a retrograde motion about the neutron star , resulting in an observed frequency slightly lower than that of the star s spin ( strohmayer et al .",
    "1997 ; cumming & bildsten 2000 ; spitkovsky , levin , and ushomirsky 2002 ; heyl 2002 ) .",
    "finally , in a handful of bursts there are episodes of drifts to lower frequency ( `` spin - down '' ) in the tails of the bursts @xcite and strong detections of signals at second frequencies within a few hz of the primary signal @xcite .",
    "if anything is clear , it is that more observational clues are required to understand burst oscillations . in this paper",
    ", we address the how the frequency of these oscillations evolves as a function of time , in order to establish the coherence of the underlying mechanism .",
    "in particular , we employ standard pulse phase analysis techniques adapted from pulsar timing studies @xcite .",
    "our analysis used observations with the proportional counter array ( pca ; jahoda et al .",
    "1996 ) on the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) .",
    "pca consists of five identical gas - filled proportional counter units with a total effective area of 6000  @xmath8 and sensitivity in the 2.560  kev range .",
    "the detector is capable of recording photons with microsecond time resolution and 256-channel energy resolution .",
    "the data were recorded in a wide variety of data modes with different time and energy resolutions , depending upon the details of the original proposed programs and the available telemetry bandwidth . for all of the analysis presented here , we converted the tt photon arrival times at the spacecraft to barycentric dynamical time ( tdb )    at the solar system barycenter , using the jet propulsion laboratory de-200 solar system ephemeris ( standish et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "we searched the entire _ rxte _ public data archive for x - ray bursts from 8 neutron stars29 have been observed during observations of the bursting pulsar gro  j1744@xmath928 .",
    "a search for these bursts was not part of the analysis presented here . ] that are known to exhibit burst oscillations ( see table 1 and muno et al .",
    "2001 ) . as of september 2001",
    ", we have identified a total of 159 x - ray bursts from these 8 sources .",
    "each of these bursts was then searched for millisecond oscillations as described below .    for our analysis , we used data containing a single energy channel ( 2.560 kev ) and @xmath10  s ( 122 @xmath11s ) resolution .",
    "we note that the use of more restricted energy bands can sometimes allow oscillation trains to be detected for a second or two longer , since the oscillation amplitudes are often stronger at higher energies ( e.g. , muno et al .",
    "2000 ; giles et al .",
    "however , in many cases , the data modes with higher energy resolution contained data gaps due to the limited size of the satellite memory buffers , making it difficult to produce a coherent phase model spanning the entire oscillation train ( see section  2.2 ) . data modes specifically designed to start recording during a burst ( `` burst catcher '' modes ) were analyzed in combination with the other modes in order to fill data gaps , but the burst catcher modes with high time resolution only recorded in a single 2.560  kev energy channel .",
    "we produced fourier power spectra of 1 s intervals of data for the first 16 s of each burst , and searched for signals within a frequency range of @xmath12  hz from the frequencies listed in table  [ sources ] .",
    "any oscillation with a single trial probability of less than @xmath13 that it is due to noise ( a power of @xmath14 according to the normalization of leahy et al .",
    "1983 ) was considered a detection .",
    "this corresponds to a 1% probability that a noise signal will be that strong given a search of an entire burst , so that 12 noise signals may appear significant from the search of our entire sample of bursts .",
    "we detected 68 oscillation trains in this manner ( table  [ sources ] ) .",
    "we also recorded the frequencies of each signal detected .",
    "the frequencies in table  [ sources ] were determined recursively , by computing the median value ( rounded to the nearest hz ) from the signals detected until that value did not change . the range of detected frequencies is reported in section  3.1 .    to qualitatively examine the frequency evolution , we computed power spectra of 2 s intervals of data every 0.25 s , and plotted contours of power as a function of both time and frequency .",
    "we tapered the data with a welch function @xcite before computing each power spectrum , in order to suppress the power in sidebands due to the window function .",
    "a typical example of such a dynamic power spectrum is illustrated in figure  [ fig : typical ] .",
    "we use dynamic power spectra to characterize the oscillations in sections  3.23.3 .      in order to examine in detail whether the oscillations are coherent and drift to stable asymptotic frequencies , we developed frequency models using the phase connection method described in @xcite .",
    "we modeled all oscillations that lasted continuously for more than 2 s using the @xmath10  s data ( table  [ sources ] ) .",
    "a summary of the procedure is as follows .",
    "we fold the data in 0.250.5 s intervals according to a trial frequency model ( which is the derivative of a phase model ) , and compute a fourier transform of the resulting profile . if the power @xmath15 in the fundamental frequency of the pulsation has less than a 10% chance of occurring randomly due to noise ( @xmath16 in the normalization of leahy et al .  1983 ) , we measure its phase by a linear least squares fit of a sinusoid to the profile .",
    "the measured phase residuals @xmath17 are then related to the predicted phases @xmath18 by @xmath19 in the above convention , an increasing phase residual indicates that the instantaneous trial frequency ( @xmath20 ) is too low .",
    "the phase residuals @xmath21 are then modeled via a least squares minimization , using a @xmath22 statistic calculated from the phase residuals : @xmath23 here , @xmath24 is the uncertainty on the phase measured from the folded profile , which can easily be determined from the diagonal values of the covariance matrix in the linear least squares fit @xcite . we have confirmed that these uncertainties are accurate via monte carlo simulations , in which we ( _ i _ ) perturbed the counts in each bin of the profile within the range expected from poisson counting noise and ( _ ii _ ) recorded the uncertainty as the standard deviation of phase measurements of 100 perturbed profiles .",
    "we also verified the values for @xmath24 by visual inspection .",
    "the phase connection technique provides a correction @xmath25 to the original frequency model @xmath26 , so that the best - fit frequency is @xmath27 this procedure can be iterated using the new frequency model , if it is composed of linear functions .",
    "the advantages of this method are that ( _ i _ ) the form of the observed phase residuals naturally suggests the best model for the frequency evolution and provides a quantitative test of how well the trial phase evolution matches the data , ( _ ii _ ) there exist standard techniques to calculate the uncertainties on the model from the least squares fit to the phases , and ( _ iii _ ) the method utilizes the phase information that the power spectrum discards , which allows much finer frequency resolution on short time scales .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath28 method of @xcite distinguishes between models based upon the amount of power in the folded profile , but provides little information about how the frequency of an oscillation deviates from the model assumed .",
    "the @xmath28 statistic is still very useful for examining the amplitude and phase evolution of the oscillations on short ( less than 0.1 s ) time scales after the frequency evolution is modeled .",
    "we apply this technique and use the resulting models in sections  3.43.7 .      finally , we produced energy spectra in 0.25 s intervals from each burst using available combinations of data modes that provide at least 32 energy channels .",
    "the detector response was estimated using pcarsp in ftools version 5.1 ( see http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/lheasoft/ ) .",
    "we subtracted spectra from 15 s of emission prior to the burst to account for background , and fit each spectrum between 2.520 kev with a model consisting of a blackbody multiplied by a constant interstellar absorption factor .",
    "the absorbing column for each burst was taken to be the mean value from fits to each 0.25 s interval assuming a variable absorption .",
    "the model provides a color temperature ( @xmath29 ) and a normalization proportional to the square of the apparent radius of the burst emission surface ( @xmath30 ) , and allows us to estimate the bolometric flux as a function of time .",
    "we compare these spectra to the properties of the oscillations in sections  3.3 and 3.6 .",
    "in order to establish the range of frequencies over which the oscillations are observed , and in particular whether there are strict upper limits to their frequencies , we produced a histogram of the distribution of the frequencies at which signals were detected in non - overlapping 1 s intervals during the bursts from each source ( figure  [ hist ] ) . for the majority of sources , the histograms are narrowly distributed with a width of 2 - 4  hz , significantly smaller than the 10  hz search window .",
    "this corresponds to frequency drifts ranging from 0.4% ( ) to 1.2% ( ) .",
    "the distribution from  appears to be double - peaked , possibly owing to two effects .",
    "first , oscillations are usually observed from this source only in the rise and tail , and the frequency gap between the two peaks could result from the fact that we do not observe the intermediate frequencies as the oscillations evolve ( see section  3.2 ) .",
    "however , two oscillations are present simultaneously in several bursts from this source ( see    section  3.3 and miller 2000 ) , which could indicate there are indeed two fundamental frequencies .    one detected oscillation is unusual given the distributions in figure  [ hist ] , and has already been noted by wijnands , strohmayer , & franco ( 2000 ) . it is detected in  about 4 hz above the next highest frequency , with a probability of @xmath31 that it is due to noise given all of the trial frequencies searched .",
    "the oscillation occurs at 571  hz in a single interval about 15 s into the tail of a burst , while the oscillation detected earlier in the burst seemed to disappear about 5 s into the burst after reaching an asymptotic frequency of 567 hz .",
    "if this    signal is a burst oscillation , it calls into question whether we are observing frequency saturation at all .",
    "we also searched the dynamic power spectra to confirm that the oscillations in our sample drift upward in frequency during the course of the burst , saturating at an approximately constant frequency late in the tail .",
    "this trend occurs in most bursts , and is illustrated in figure  [ fig : typical ] . however , there are a few exceptions that have been noted in the literature , such as ( _ i _ ) clear evidence for a frequency _ decrease _ several seconds after the burst is first detected ( spin - down ) and ( _ ii _ ) signals present at two frequencies simultaneously .",
    "spin - down episodes and simultaneous signals are not common .",
    "we find only 3 clear examples of spin - down episodes during bursts , which we display in figure  [ sdown ] .",
    "two of these have been reported previously , from  @xcite and  @xcite , and we find one additional example from . in all cases ,",
    "the frequency decrease is on order 1  hz .",
    "there is no clear pattern as to when in the burst the spin - down occurs . in",
    ", the event occurs in the peak of the burst , while in  and  the spin - down occurs as the burst decays .",
    "we also find two clear examples of bursts in which two signals are detected simultaneously at frequencies separated by about 1  hz . the most significant example has already been reported by @xcite from , and we find a second example in .",
    "both are displayed in figure  [ fig : twofreq ] .",
    "the second oscillation in  occurs between 23 s into the burst , and has a chance probability @xmath32 of occurring randomly due to noise ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the second signal from  occurs 11 s into the burst , and is only marginally significant , with a single - trial chance probability of @xmath33 .",
    "less significant examples , with chance probabilities of @xmath34 , have also been reported in    two more bursts from  by @xcite , and in one burst from  by @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "the secondary frequencies are 13  hz lower than the main signal .      in many bursts ,",
    "photospheric radius expansion is evident at the start of the burst , during which @xmath30 increases and @xmath29 decreases such that the bolometric flux remains constant , presumably at the eddington limit ( see lewin et al .",
    "we plot examples of bursts with and without radius expansion in figure  [ fig : pre ] .",
    "we examined whether radius expansion affects the times in the burst when the oscillations are observed .",
    "we find that all 16 of the bursts in which oscillation trains are observed continuously throughout the rises , peaks , and tails fail to exhibit radius expansion ( e.g. figure  [ fig : pre]a ) .",
    "of the 51 bursts where the oscillation train is not observed during the peak , 40 exhibit radius expansion ( e.g. figure  [ fig : pre]b ) .",
    "one burst from  ( 1998 march 27 at 14:08:30 tdb ) could not    be examined , because there were gaps in the high time resolution data during the peak .",
    "since it also has been noticed previously that oscillations in  @xcite and  @xcite appear only after radius expansion ends , we conclude that radius expansion either obscures or interrupts the oscillations .",
    "we modeled the frequency evolution of the oscillations using the phase connection technique described in section  2.2 .",
    "we tried both polynomial models ( up to fifth order ) and a saturating exponential such that the frequency evolution is of the form used by @xcite : @xmath35 here , @xmath36 is the asymptotic frequency of the oscillation , @xmath37 is the frequency drift referenced to the start of the burst , and @xmath38 is the time scale for the frequency drift .",
    "when modeling the data with polynomials , we iterated the fitting procedure until no improvement in the fits to the phase residuals was found .",
    "the fits using the exponential model were executed on phase residuals found assuming a constant trial frequency , as the corrections must add linearly to the trial phase model in order to use the iterative process .",
    "table  [ bestmod ] lists the number of oscillations best fit with each model , as determined from the value of reduced @xmath22 .",
    "if the reduced @xmath22 was greater than one , and if both the number of degrees of freedom and the value of @xmath22 decreased in comparing one model to another , an @xmath39-test @xcite was used to ensure that the decrease in @xmath22 had less than a 5% chance of being random .    figure  [ consev]a illustrates the importance of considering the phases in modeling the frequency evolution . judging from power spectra alone ,",
    "the frequency of this oscillation from  appears roughly constant ( _ top panel _ ) .",
    "however , when one examines the phase residuals from a constant frequency model it is clear that additional evolution has occurred ( _ center panel _ ) .",
    "an acceptable fit to the frequency evolution only can be achieved using a fifth order polynomial ( _ bottom panel _ ) .",
    "although some of this frequency evolution can be inferred from the power spectra alone ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , by tracking the phase we are able to achieve high frequency resolution and to determine how coherent the oscillations are .",
    "we modeled 59 oscillations from 6 different sources ( table  [ sources ] ) .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ bestmod ] .",
    "thirty - seven oscillations required either an exponential model or a polynomial of third degree or higher .",
    "exponential models are only favored over polynomials in only 6 out of 37 cases .",
    "the exponential models are formally inconsistent ( greater than 99% confidence ) in 22 of the remaining 31 cases , while all such frequency models are inconsistent with the data in 12 out of 37 cases .",
    "the polynomial models generally reproduce the frequency evolution better than exponential models because there is slower frequency evolution at the start of the oscillation train , inflection in the evolution during the train , or a decrease in the oscillation frequency as the trains disappear ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ consev ] exhibits all of these variations in the frequency evolution .",
    "in addition to the upward drifts in frequency that saturate after a few seconds , the frequencies also tend to wander by about 0.1  hz ( see , e.g. , the evolution in the top panel of figure  [ consev]a ) .",
    "we see no evidence for a rapid decrease in frequency at the start of the oscillation that is comparable in magnitude to the later upward drift in frequency .",
    "such a frequency decrease could occur as the burning front spreads around the surface of the neutron star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but may be too rapid to observe using our analyses .      in general , we find many more large values of @xmath22 than would be expected if the phase evolution were described by smooth , low - order polynomial and exponential functions .",
    "in particular , 30% of the oscillation trains are inconsistent with smooth models with 99% confidence .",
    "this could indicate that the underlying mechanism is not perfectly stable .",
    "we tried higher - order polynomials in instances where our best - fit model is statistically unacceptable , but we find that we achieve only marginal improvements in @xmath22 .",
    "higher - order polynomials can smooth residuals in the middle of the oscillation train , but tend to create larger residuals at the endpoints .",
    "figure  [ failed ] illustrates two examples of oscillation trains that we were unable to fit with    exponential or polynomial models .",
    "piecewise smooth phase functions would provide better fits in some instances , such as between 24 s in figure  [ failed]a , and 36 s in figure  [ failed]b .",
    "however , the resulting discontinuities in the derivatives of the phases would imply that the frequencies of the oscillations shift in less than 0.25 s.    moreover , some of the residuals appear to be discrete changes in the phases of the oscillations .",
    "one possible explanation for the phase residuals in the first 12 s of figure  [ failed]a is that two signals are present simultaneously within about 1 hz , the resolution of the folding technique .",
    "simultaneous signals with only slightly larger frequency separations have been seen in other bursts from  @xcite . in figure",
    "[ failed]b , there appear to be discrete jumps of about 0.1 cycle in the phase of the oscillation from 710 s into the burst , similar to that observed by @xcite during an oscillation in the rise of a burst from .",
    "we confirmed that the sudden changes in the phases of the oscillations are not due to variations in the pulse profile , which is always sinusoidal .",
    "the presence of phase jumps suggests that the oscillations are not strictly coherent .",
    "our models also allowed us to compare the frequency evolution to other properties of the bursts .",
    "we first measured the observed change in frequency @xmath37 for the continuous portion of each oscillation .",
    "we then measured the time scale @xmath38 that represents how long the oscillation took to evolve in frequency by @xmath40 from the minimum observed frequency ( compare equation  2 ) .",
    "as measures of the burst time scales , we have fit the decay in flux of each of these bursts with either one or two exponential functions ( @xmath41 $ ] ) .",
    "we also computed the peak bolometric flux and the fluence of each burst , using the exponential fit to determine the flux contribution at late times .",
    "we find that neither @xmath37 nor @xmath38 are correlated with the above burst properties .",
    "we have also compared @xmath37 and @xmath38 with the duration of the oscillations and the time at which they began .",
    "we find that @xmath38 is not correlated with the start time or duration of the oscillations .",
    "instead , @xmath38 is distributed uniformly between 0.755.5 s. we plot the frequency drift @xmath37 as a function of these parameters in figure  [ tstart ] .",
    "oscillations that are first observed early in the burst evolve over a larger frequency range ( _ top panel _ ) , but their frequency drift is not correlated with how long the oscillations last ( _ bottom panel _ ) .",
    "this suggests that the evolution is initiated by the start of the burst .",
    "cummings & bildsten ( 2000 ) previously noticed that the fractional frequency drifts @xmath42 in sources with @xmath43600 hz oscillations are a factor of two smaller than those in @xmath43300 hz oscillations . we have indicated the data from the faster ( @xmath43600  hz ) oscillations in figure  [ tstart ] with filled circles .",
    "the continuous portions of the fast oscillations tend to start later in the burst ( with only two exceptions ) and to drift by a smaller absolute frequency range .",
    "we believe that this is due to the fact that the faster oscillations tend to occur in bursts with radius expansion ( muno et    al .",
    "2001),which prevents the oscillations from being observed earlier in the bursts ( see section  3.1 ) .",
    "indeed , the fast oscillators in figure  [ hist ] do not in general have a narrower distribution of observed frequencies when considering the non - continuous portions of the oscillations as well .",
    "however , we do confirm that the fractional frequency drift is a factor of two smaller in the @xmath43600  hz oscillators than in the @xmath43300  hz ones , but only because the frequencies @xmath44 are larger .",
    "if the frequencies of the oscillations are associated with underlying stable clocks , then the fact that they evolve in frequency implies that the phases of the oscillations drift by several cycles with respect to those clocks . if we take the maximum observed frequency ( @xmath45 ) to represent the stable clock ( see section  3.7 ) , then we can define a phase loss by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the derivative of our phase model .",
    "we find that oscillations typically lose between 15 cycles , depending on the magnitude of the frequency drift , the duration of the oscillations , and the time scale for the frequency evolution .",
    "one exceptional oscillation , illustrated in figure  [ consev]b , drifts by more than 17 cycles with respect to @xmath45 .",
    "this oscillation is unusual for its combination of a long duration ( 10  s ) , a large frequency change ( @xmath48  hz ) , and a slow drift time scale ( @xmath49  s ) .      aside from the exceptions noted above , the fundamental features that led to the adoption of an exponential model for the frequency evolution by @xcite",
    "are present in about @xmath50 of burst oscillations : the oscillations increase in frequency when they are first observed , but appear to reach stable frequencies on the time scale of seconds .",
    "several authors have noted that the asymptotic frequencies of burst oscillations detected several years apart are remarkably similar @xcite .",
    "therefore , we measured the maximum frequencies that the oscillations reached according to our best fit models , in order to determine whether the apparent saturation frequencies of the oscillations are stable .",
    "the 1-@xmath51 uncertainties on the maximum frequency were found by a search through @xmath22 space ( e.g * ? ? ? * ) . in those instances",
    "where the best available fit was statistically unacceptable , we inflated the uncertainties on the phase measurements to for the reduced @xmath22 to equal 1 before the search in @xmath22 space .",
    "the maximum frequency was constrained to occur after a minimum , as in several cases the absolute highest frequency was observed at the start of the oscillation train ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* and figure  3a ) .",
    "our measurements are consistent with those found using the @xmath28 statistic by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we compare our results for  with those of @xcite in section  4.2    in figure  [ dispersion ] , we plot how the maximum frequencies vary with time . to indicate those oscillations where the frequency has apparently saturated , we have indicated which ones required at least an exponential or a 3rd order polynomial phase model by diamonds .",
    "the measurements taken from first or second order polynomial models are plotted only with error bars .",
    "we have calculated the fractional standard deviation in the maximum frequencies , @xmath52 , for those sources with more than two values , and listed them in table  [ tab : disp ] . for  and , the frequency evolution appeared to saturate during two bursts each , so we report the fractional difference between the measurements .",
    "the deviations in these frequencies @xmath52 are quite small , less than one part in 1000 .",
    "the frequency evolution of burst oscillations can be described by smooth phase models in all but 30% of the pulsations that we have studied ( section  3.5 ; see also strohmayer 2001 ) .",
    "the discrepant cases appear as phase jumps in figure  [ failed ] .",
    "if the oscillations result from brightness asymmetries on the surface of the neutron star , it appears that some of the following occur : ( _ i _ ) there are multiple anisotropies or modes that propagate with slightly different velocities relative to the surface , which results in two simultaneous signals that interfere with each other ( see also section  3.2 ) , ( _ ii _ ) the velocity of the pattern changes suddenly on time scales of 0.25 s , or ( _ iii _ ) the anisotropies change their longitude in less than a tenth of a second , resulting in sudden phase jumps of about 0.1 cycles .    on time scales of years ,",
    "the oscillations are stable to a few parts in 1000 .",
    "this is consistent with the doppler    shifts that are expected from the binary orbit .",
    "since this raises the possibility of measuring a mass function for the companion star , we now examine this frequency dispersion in detail .",
    "the change in the apparent spin frequency due to the orbital motion of the neutron star is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the mass of the neutron star and companion respectively in solar units , @xmath56 is the binary orbital period in hours , and @xmath57 is the inclination of the orbital plane normal to the line of sight . assuming a star with solar density that over - fills it roche lobe , the mass and orbital period are related by @xmath58 ( frank , king , & raine 1995 ) . for @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , the half - amplitude of the doppler variation would be @xmath63 .",
    "this is a factor of 25 smaller than the dispersions from , , and  ( figure  [ dispersion ] ) , but it is of the right order of magnitude .",
    "only three oscillation sources have known orbital ephemerides :  @xcite ,  @xcite , and  @xcite .",
    "we did not measure enough oscillations from  and  to constrain the parameters of the binary orbit .",
    "we have measured eleven oscillations that appear to saturate from  ( the diamonds in figure  [ dispersion ] ) , so we have attempted to fit a sinusoid to the maximum frequencies as a function of orbital phase ( figure  [ phase ] ) .",
    "the best - fit sinusoid , allowing the reference phase to vary , has a @xmath22 of 221 for 8 degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , sinusoidal orbital modulations can not cause all of the observed dispersion . in figure",
    "[ phase ] we plot a sinusoid with an amplitude equal to the standard deviation of the points fit , @xmath64 .",
    "the disagreement between the data and the sinusoid is primarily due to three oscillations with low maximum frequencies .",
    "two of these lasted for more than 5 s , one of which is displayed in the right panel of figure  [ consev ] ( 1999 june 10 ) .",
    "we will discuss this further in the next section .",
    "there are no other effects that ordinarily change the apparent spin frequencies of neutron stars ( i.e. pulsars ) that can produce the dispersion in figures  [ dispersion ] and [ phase ] .",
    "accretion torques can alternately quicken or slow the rotation of the neutron star , and would provide the next largest effect @xcite .",
    "the torque on a neutron star can be estimated by assuming that its magnetic field disrupts the disk at some fiducial radius @xmath65 and removes all of its angular momentum . at @xmath65",
    ", we have @xmath66 .",
    "we take @xmath65 to be the co - rotation radius , where    @xmath67 , so that @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the accretion rate in eddington units , @xmath70 is the radius of the neutron star in units of 10  km , @xmath54 is its mass in solar units , @xmath71 is its moment of inertia in units of @xmath72 g @xmath8 , and @xmath6 is the stellar spin frequency in khz .",
    "the values are scaled to those expected for a burster . for a spin frequency of 200  hz ,",
    "equation  [ eq : torque ] corresponds to a @xmath73 in one year .",
    "clearly , the observed dispersion in the maximum frequencies on time scales of a month ( figure  [ dispersion ] ) is much larger than can be explained by accretion torques ( equation  [ eq : torque ] ) .",
    "@xcite recently examined a larger sample of oscillations from , and found that there is a subset of the burst oscillations whose maximum frequencies are distributed as a gaussian about 581.64 hz with a width of 0.08 hz .",
    "we can not independently test this , as the uncertainties that we report on the maximum frequencies are up to a factor of 5 larger than those in @xcite .",
    "this is because the phase - connection technique we used to measure the maximum frequencies accounts for the frequency evolution of the oscillations , while the dynamic @xmath28 technique @xcite used assumes that the frequency is constant during each 2 s interval that they test . in our analysis ,",
    "the maximum frequency is usually observed at the end of the oscillation train where the data can tolerate relatively large variations in the values of the polynomial models . in the analysis of @xcite ,",
    "if significant frequency evolution occurs during a 2 s interval , they measure the mean frequency in that interval , but do not consider how much larger the frequency could be at the end of the interval . as a result the magnitude of our uncertainties , 0.050.4  hz , are often larger than the width of the gaussian of @xcite .    if we only include those oscillations that are part of the gaussian in @xcite , we find that the data are consistent with no modulation .",
    "fitting a sinusoid to the data , we derive a fractional amplitude of @xmath74 ( @xmath75 for 5 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "this is equivalent to a doppler shift of 150@xmath7663 km s@xmath77 , which is significantly larger than the 90% upper limit to the velocity from giles et al .",
    "( 2002 ; 55 km s@xmath77 ) .",
    "the larger uncertainties that we assumed result in larger upper limits on the velocity .",
    "these systematic uncertainties also present an additional hurdle in measuring the orbital motion of the neutron star .",
    "three models have been proposed to explain the frequency evolution of the burst oscillations , all of which assume that anisotropies develop in the surface brightness of the neutron star @xcite .",
    "the simplest model was proposed by @xcite , who suggested that the oscillations originate from hot regions on a burning layer that expands and decouples from the neutron star at the start of the burst .",
    "the oscillations are observed when the burning layer begins to contract , causing them to increase in frequency as the layer re - couples to the neutron star .",
    "however , recent calculations assuming that the burning layer is rigidly rotating predict a frequency drift a factor of three smaller than that observed @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite predicted that there should be a fractional dispersion of at most @xmath78 in the observed asymptotic frequencies , if the height of burning layer is smaller when it re - couples to the star than when it decouples .",
    "this is a factor of 10 smaller than the residual dispersion from  in figure  [ phase ] .    as a result",
    ", it is important to consider other models for the frequency evolution of burst oscillations . @xcite",
    "have suggested that a brightness contrast could result from a hydrodynamical instability in a geostrophic flow , similar to jupiter s great red spot , while @xcite has proposed that rossby waves propagating retrograde on the neutron star could produce traveling brightness patterns on the stellar surface .",
    "the frequency evolution in both models is caused by changes in the velocity at which the pattern propagates around the star .",
    "the velocity in turn is sensitive to the temperature , density , and vertical structure of the surface layers .",
    "thus , variations in the properties of the surface layers near the end of a burst can naturally explain the observed dispersion in the asymptotic frequencies of the oscillations ( figures  [ dispersion ] and [ phase ] ) . on short time",
    "scales , instabilities in either mechanism conceivably could cause the apparent phase jumps in figure  [ failed ] .",
    "moreover , @xcite also has predicted that rossby waves with different numbers of radial nodes could produce simultaneous signals at multiple frequencies , as are seen in rare cases ( section  3.2 ; compare section  3.5 ) .",
    "these models are promising , although how these mechanisms produce brightness variations on the stellar surface remains to be studied in detail .",
    "we have examined 68 burst oscillations observed in 159 bursts from 8 different sources , and have modeled the frequency evolution of 59 oscillations from 6 sources ( table  [ bestmod ] ) .",
    "the most notable result is that there appears to be slight instability in the mechanism generating the oscillations on time scales of both seconds and years .",
    "about 30% of the oscillation trains do not exhibit smooth frequency evolution , as both low order polynomials and exponential models are statistically inconsistent with the data ( figure  [ failed ] ) .",
    "the possible explanations are that ( _ i _ ) two signals may be present simultaneously , invalidating our assumption that there is a single signal in our analysis , ( _ ii _ ) there are discrete phase jumps that occur on time scales less than a second , and ( _ iii _ ) the frequencies of the oscillations shift dramatically on time scales of 0.25 s. on longer time scales , the maximum frequencies observed during these oscillation trains exhibit a fractional dispersion of @xmath1 ( figure  [ dispersion ] ) . for 5 of",
    "the sources studied , this dispersion could be consistent with doppler shifts of signals originating from rotating neutron stars as they orbit the centers of mass of their binaries .",
    "however , the dispersion in the maximum frequencies in  is uncorrelated with its known orbital period ( figure  [ phase ] ) .",
    "\\2 ) both spin - down in the oscillation train and obvious examples of simultaneous signals separated by around 1 hz are relatively rare , occurring in 3 and 2 bursts out of 65 respectively ( figure  [ sdown ] and [ fig : twofreq ] ) .",
    "\\3 ) the amounts of the frequency drifts appear larger when oscillations are observed earlier in the bursts ( figure  [ tstart ] ) , but are uncorrelated with the durations of the oscillations .",
    "this implies that the starts of the bursts set in motion the eventual changes in the oscillation frequencies , as opposed to some mechanism that operates when the oscillations themselves appear .",
    "\\4 ) photospheric radius expansion appears to temporarily interrupt oscillations .",
    "all of the 16 oscillation trains that appear continuously from the rise to the tail of the burst fail to exhibit radius expansion .",
    "when radius expansion does occur , oscillations are often seen in the rise and/or the tail of the burst , but rarely during the radius expansion ( figure  [ fig : pre ] ) .",
    "\\5 ) aside from the above points , the time scale and magnitude of the frequency evolution does not appear correlated with other properties of the burst , such as its decay time scale , peak flux , or fluence .",
    "\\6 ) in about 60% of the oscillation trains , the frequency evolution displays inflections that can not be described by an exponential model .",
    "two illustrative examples are shown in figure  [ consev ] .",
    "thus , in addition to the upward frequency drift , the frequency tends to wander by on order 0.1  hz in a random manner .",
    "several models have been proposed in which the oscillations originate from an anisotropy in the emission from the neutron star s surface .",
    "each models the frequency evolution as originating from different mechanisms @xcite .",
    "the apparent lack of stability in the underlying clock producing these oscillations favors the models in which the brightness asymmetry originates from hydrodynamic instabilities @xcite or modes excited in the neutron star ocean @xcite .",
    "future studies of the amplitude , harmonic structure , energy spectrum , and phase lags of the oscillations will further constrain the location of the hot spot and probe the atmosphere of the neutron star .    0 alpar , m. a. , cheng , a. f. , ruderman , m. a. , & shaham , j. 1982 , , 300 , 728 bevington , p. r. 1969 , _ data reduction and error analysis for the physical sciences _ , new york : mcgraw - hill bildsten , l. 1995 , , 438 , 852 bildsten , l. 1998 , , 501 , l89 cumming , a. & bildsten , l. 2000 , , 544 , 453 cumming , a. , morsink , s. m. , bildsten , l. , friedman , j. l. , & holz , d. e. 2002 , , 564 , 343 frank , j. , king , a. , & raine , d. 1995 , accretion power in astrophysics ( second edition ) , ( cambridge : cambridge university press ) fryxell , b. a. & woosley , s. e. 1982 , , 261 , 332 galloway , d. k. , chakrabarty , d. , muno , m. p. , & savov , p. 2001",
