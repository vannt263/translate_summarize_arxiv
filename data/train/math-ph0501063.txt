    "the basic question of `` quantum chaos '' is what signatures of the classical ( chaotic ) dynamics one can still find in the quantized system .",
    "one important such signature is given by the asymptotic behavior of expectation values , and the limit distribution around their average in the semiclassical limit .",
    "for classically chaotic systems , the average of smooth observables on phase space , along the trajectories of the system , tend almost always to the phase space average ( i.e. , the classical dynamics is ergodic ) .",
    "the quantum analog of this , following the correspondence principle , is that the expectation values of an observable should tend to the phase space average of the observable in the semiclassical limit .",
    "the first result in this direction is `` hnirelman s theorem '' , which states that at least in the sense of convergence in the mean square , when taking planck s constant @xmath1 , the matrix elements converge to the phase space average  @xcite .",
    "this notion is usually referred to as  quantum ergodicity \" ( q.e . ) .    in the approach to the limit",
    ", the different matrix elements can fluctuate about their classical limit . in  @xcite feingold and",
    "peres proposed a formula for the variance of the fluctuations in the semiclassical limit .",
    "as mentioned above , according to hnirelman s theorem the variance vanishes as @xmath1 .",
    "nevertheless , after normalizing by an appropriate power of @xmath2 , the feingold - peres formula relates the variance of the matrix elements to classical correlations of the observable . in  @xcite ,",
    "eckhardt et al . developed a semiclassical theory for the variance of these fluctuations , giving support for the validity of the feingold - peres formula , and suggesting that after normalizing by the variance , the fluctuation should be gaussian ( at least for hyperbolic systems ) .",
    "the analysis in @xcite , for the fluctuations of the matrix elements , can be extended to deal with quantum maps  @xcite .",
    "in particular , for generic hyperbolic quantum maps on the 2d - torus @xmath3 , it predicts gaussian distribution with variance of order @xmath4 , where @xmath5 plays the role of the inverse of planck s constant , and @xmath6 is related to the classical variance of the observable .",
    "a fundamental example for a quantum map on the torus is the quantum cat map , originally introduced by hannay and berry @xcite . here",
    "the classical dynamics is simply the iteration of a symplectic linear map @xmath7 on @xmath8 .",
    "when @xmath9 has no roots of unity for eigenvalues , the classical dynamics is ` chaotic ' ( i.e. , ergodic and mixing ) .    for the quantization of the cat map , the admissible values of planck s constant are inverses of integers , and",
    "the space of quantum states is then @xmath10 $ ] . the semiclassical limit is achieved by taking @xmath11 , and we restrict the discussion to the case where @xmath12 is prime . for @xmath13 a smooth observable , we denote by @xmath14 its quantization .",
    "the quantization of the map @xmath9 , is then a unitary operator @xmath15 acting on @xmath16 .    for @xmath17 , this model was studied extensively and it exhibits some interesting features @xcite .",
    "it is shown to be ( q.e . ) , but not ( q.u.e . ) .",
    "however , in @xcite kurlberg and rudnick introduced a group of symmetries of the system , a family of commuting unitary maps of @xmath16 that commute with @xmath15 .",
    "these operators are called hecke operators , in analogy to a similar setup on the modular surface @xcite .",
    "the space @xmath16 has an orthonormal basis consisting of joint eigenstates @xmath18 called `` hecke eigenstates '' . for these states",
    "the system is shown to be ( q.u.e . )  @xcite .    in @xcite kurlberg and",
    "rudnick studied the fluctuation of the matrix elements for the desymmetrized system and gave a conjecture for the limit distribution , which is radically different from the behavior expected in the generic case .",
    "in particular , a fourth moment calculation for the distribution showed that it is not gaussian . furthermore , though the variance of the fluctuation is of order @xmath19 as expected , the classical factor is different from the classical variance , in contrast to the feingold - peres formula ( for comparison see @xcite ) .    in @xcite luo and",
    "sarnak showed similar behavior of the variance for hecke eigenforms on the modular surface .",
    "for this system , the variance of the fluctuations after appropriately normalizing , does not converge to the classical variance of the observable .",
    "however the classical variance can be recovered , after inserting some arithmetic correction .",
    "furthermore the limit distribution for the hecke eigenforms is again not gaussian ( pending on conjectures of keating and snaith @xcite ) .    in this note we look at the matrix elements for quantized cat maps on @xmath20 , and the variance of their fluctuations .",
    "here we find that for certain maps and observables , the variance has a different rate of decay than that predicted by the feingold - peres formula .",
    "let @xmath21 be a matrix with @xmath22 distinct eigenvalues .",
    "for the dynamics to be ergodic we assume that @xmath9 has no roots of unity for eigenvalues .",
    "we further assume that the vector space @xmath23 decomposes into two rational orthogonal symplectic subspaces , invariant under the action of @xmath9 .",
    "denote by @xmath24 , the lattices obtained by intersecting these subspaces with @xmath25 .",
    "analogously to the treatment of the case @xmath17 we introduce hecke operators , a family of commuting operators that commute with @xmath15 , and consider a basis of joint eigenstates @xmath26 , referred to as the hecke basis . for any smooth observable @xmath27 , denote the quantum variance in the hecke basis by @xmath28    [ t:1 ] let @xmath29 . then , as @xmath30 through primes , the variance of these observables is given by @xmath31    this result is in contrast to the expected rate of @xmath32 , predicted to hold for all observables in generic hyperbolic systems .",
    "this result can be extended to any smooth observable @xmath33 , to state that @xmath34 , if the fourier coefficients of @xmath35 are supported outside the lattices @xmath36 , and @xmath37 otherwise .",
    "the terms @xmath38 can be expressed as quadratic forms in the fourier coefficients of @xmath35 , see @xcite for more details .    after knowing the variance of the fluctuation , we can renormalize the matrix elements and consider the limit distribution .",
    "we present some numerical calculations of this distribution , for the two types of elementary observables ( figures [ f:1],[f:2 ] respectively ) .",
    "the numerical evidence suggests that when @xmath39 , the distribution of the normalized matrix elements is given by the semicircle law , where otherwise after appropriately normalizing , it corresponds to the product of two semicircle random variables .",
    "this result , is in agreement with the conjecture presented in @xcite for the limit distribution for the cat map on @xmath40 .",
    "furthermore , assuming that all matrix elements are roughly of the same order , the square root of the variance obtained here , gives an estimate of the rate of their decay . in figure",
    "[ f:3 ] , we present numerical calculation for this decay , strongly supporting the validity of this estimate .",

    ", since @xmath9 has no rational eigenvectors we can assume @xmath12 is sufficiently large so that @xmath123 are not eigenvectors of @xmath169 respectively .",
    "the proof now follows directly from the first part of proposition [ pqv:1 ] .",
    "note that if we take a different hecke basis from the one constructed in the previous section , then we only change the elements in the sum corresponding to the trivial character .",
    "these elements , from the second part of proposition [ pqv:1 ] , contribute @xmath170 ( respectively @xmath171 if @xmath167 ) .",
    "therefor this result holds for any hecke basis .",
    "the main ingredient in the proof of theorem [ t:1 ] , is the fact that the quantized system can be identified as a tensor product of two quantized two dimensional systems , and that there are observables whose quantization is trivial on one of the factors .",
    "this behavior is clearly to be expected if the classical four dimensional system is a product of two different two dimensional systems ( e.g. , considering the four dimensional torus as a product @xmath172 , and constructing an element @xmath173 by taking two elements @xmath174 acting on each factor ) .",
    "in such a system , when looking at observables that are constant on one factor , the fluctuations of their quantization only come from the nonconstant factor , and hence the anomalous rate of decay .    however , it is interesting to note that this behavior can also occur for systems that do not factor in terms of their classical dynamics .",
    "the condition for the classical dynamics to factor , is that there is a symplectic rational invariant decomposition such that the lattice @xmath175 ( where @xmath24 are as in theorem [ t:1 ] ) . in some cases , even though the space @xmath23 decomposes into two invariant rational symplectic subspaces , the lattice @xmath176 is a proper sublattice of finite index and the classical dynamics does not factor .",
    "nevertheless , for any prime @xmath12 the vector space @xmath177 decomposes in to two invariant symplectic subspaces , and the quantized system would still behave like that of a product of two systems .",
    "it is worth mentioning that even if the matrix @xmath9 does not factor over the rationals , it does factor over a quadratic extension , and hence for half the primes it would factor modulo @xmath12 .",
    "consequently , for these primes we would still have product behavior , that is the quantized system is a tensor product of two quantized two dimensional systems .",
    "however , in this case there can be no classical observables whose quantization is trivial on one of the factors ( for infinitely many primes ) .",
    "the numerical evidence presented in figures [ f:1],[f:2 ] suggests that for the degenerate case ( where the rate of decay is @xmath19 ) the limit distribution follows the semicircle law , while otherwise it is given by the product of two random variables with semicircle distribution .",
    "in fact , assuming the validity of the kurlberg - rudnick conjecture regarding the limit distribution of matrix elements on the two dimensional torus @xcite , these results can be derived directly from the product behavior of the quantized system ( [ ered:1 ] ) .      the numerical evidence presented in figure [ f:3 ] , imply a bound on the individual matrix elements : @xmath178 given the kurlberg - rudnick rate conjecture ( which is now a theorem @xcite ) the above bound ( [ ebnd ] ) , can be derived from ( [ ered:1 ] ) as well .",
