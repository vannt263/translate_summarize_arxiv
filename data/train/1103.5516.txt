    "with the @xmath3  gev upgrade of the cebaf accelerator at the jefferson lab in the usa and with the construction of the fair facility in germany , we expect tremendous progress in understanding the properties of charmonia and charmed mesons in nuclear medium . these new facilities will be able to produce low - momenta charmonia and charmed mesons such as @xmath0 , @xmath4 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 in an atomic nucleus .",
    "because the targets are nuclei and the nuclear fermi - momentum is available , it may also be possible to produce these mesons at subthreshold energies . while at jlab charmed hadrons will be produced by scattering electrons off nuclei , at fair they",
    "will be produced by the annihilation of antiprotons on nuclei .",
    "one of the major challenges is to find appropriate kinematical conditions to produce these mesons essentially at rest , or with small momentum relative to the nucleus .",
    "one of the most exciting experimental efforts may be to search for the @xmath0-nuclear bound states amongst many other possible interesting experiments in these facilities .",
    "the discovery of such bound states would provide evidence for a negative mass shift of the @xmath0 meson , and a possible role of the qcd color van der waals forces  @xcite in nuclei .",
    "@xcite presents a recent review of the properties of charmonium states and compiles a complete list of references for theoretical studies concerning a great variety of physics issues related to these states .",
    "there is a relatively long history for the studies of charmonium binding in nuclei .",
    "the original suggestion  @xcite that multiple gluon qcd van der waals forces would be capable of binding a charmonium state led to an estimate of a binding energy as large as @xmath5  mev in an @xmath6 nucleus .",
    "however , using the same approach but taking into account the nucleon density distributions in the nucleus , ref .",
    "@xcite found a maximum of @xmath7  mev binding energy in a large nucleus .",
    "along the same line , including the nuclear density distributions in nuclei @xmath8-nuclear bound state energies were estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite . based on ref .",
    "@xcite , which showed that the mass shift of charmonium in nuclear matter can be expressed in terms of the usual second - order stark effect arising from the chromo - electric polarizability of the nucleon , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite obtained a @xmath9  mev binding for @xmath0 in nuclear matter , in the limit of infinitely heavy charm quark mass . on the other hand , for the excited charmonium states ,",
    "a much larger binding energy was obtained , e.g. @xmath10  mev for the @xmath11 state , an admittedly untrustworthy number .",
    "following the same procedure , but keeping the charm quark mass finite and using realistic charmonium bound - state wave - functions , ref .",
    "@xcite found @xmath12  mev binding energy for @xmath0 in nuclear matter , but still over @xmath13  mev binding for the charmonium excited states . while a larger value for the qcd stark effect is expected for excited states ( because of the larger sizes of these states ) , the large values for the binding energies found in the literature for these states may be an overestimate .",
    "a possible source of this overestimate is the breakdown of the multipole expansion for the larger - sized charmonium states .",
    "there are some other studies of charmonium interactions with nuclear matter , in particular involving the @xmath0 meson .",
    "qcd sum rules studies estimated a @xmath0 mass decrease in nuclear matter ranging from @xmath14 mev to @xmath15 mev  @xcite , while an estimate based on color polarizability  @xcite gave larger than @xmath16 mev . since the @xmath0 and nucleons have no quarks in common , the quark interchange or the effective meson exchange potential should be negligible to first order in elastic scattering  @xcite , and multi - gluon exchange should be dominant .",
    "furthermore , there is no pauli blocking even at the quark level .",
    "thus , if the @xmath0-nuclear bound states are formed , the signal for these states will be sharp and show a clear , narrow peak in the energy dependence of the cross section , as will be explained later .",
    "this situation has a tremendous advantage compared to the cases of the lighter vector mesons  @xcite .",
    "previously , we have studied  @xcite the @xmath0 mass shift ( scalar potential ) in nuclear matter based on an effective lagrangian approach , including the @xmath1 and @xmath2 meson loops in the @xmath0 self - energy .",
    "this is a color - singlet mechanism at the hadronic level , and may be compared to the color - octet mechanism of multi - gluon exchange , or qcd van der waals forces . in this work , we extend our previous study made in nuclear matter  @xcite to finite nuclei , and compute the @xmath0-nuclear bound state energies by explicitly solving the proca ( klein - gordon ) equation for the @xmath0 meson produced nearly at rest .",
    "furthermore , the structure of heavy nuclei , as well as the medium modification of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 masses , are explicitly included based on the quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model  @xcite .    a first estimate for the mass shifts ( scalar potentials ) for the @xmath0 meson ( and @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) in nuclear medium including the effects of @xmath1 meson loop in the @xmath0 self - energy ",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : loop ]  was made in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "-loop contribution to the @xmath0 self - energy .",
    "we include also @xmath19 and @xmath20 contributions . ]    employing a gauged effective lagrangian for the coupling of @xmath1 mesons to the charmonia , the mass shifts were found to be positive for @xmath0 and @xmath21 , and negative for @xmath22 at normal nuclear matter density @xmath23 .",
    "these results were obtained for density - dependent @xmath1 and @xmath24 masses that decrease linearly with density , such that at @xmath23 they are shifted by @xmath25  mev . the loop integral in the self - energy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : loop ] ) is divergent and was regularized using form - factors derived from the @xmath26 decay model with quark - model wave functions for @xmath27 and @xmath1 .",
    "the positive mass shift is at first sight puzzling , since even with a @xmath25  mev reduction of the @xmath1 masses , the intermediate state is still above threshold for the decay of @xmath0 into a @xmath28 pair and so a second - order contribution should be negative .",
    "however , as we have shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , this is a result of the interplay of the form factor used and the gauged nature of the interaction used in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we have estimated  @xcite the mass shift ( scalar potential ) of the @xmath0 meson including the @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 meson loops in the self - energy using non - gauged effective lagrangians .",
    "the density dependence of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 masses is included by an explicit calculation  @xcite using the quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model  @xcite .",
    "the qmc model is a quark - based model for nuclear structure which has been very successful in explaining the origin of many - body or density dependent effective forces  @xcite and hence describing nuclear matter saturation properties .",
    "it has also been used to predict a great variety of changes of hadron properties in nuclear medium , including the properties of hypernuclei  @xcite .",
    "a  review of the basic ingredients of the model and a summary of results and predictions can be found in ref .",
    "we briefly review how the @xmath0 scalar potential is calculated in nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "we use the effective lagrangian densities at the hadronic level for the vertices , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( in the following we denote by @xmath27 the field representing @xmath0 ) :    _ d d & = & i g_d d ^ , [ lpsiddbar ] + l_d d^ * & = & _ ( ^^ ) , [ lpsidd * ] + l_d^ * d^ * & = & i g_d^ * d^ * \\ { ^ + & & + d^ * + |d^ * } .",
    "[ lpsid*d * ]    the lagrangian densities above are obtained on the basis of su(4 ) invariance for the couplings among the pseudo - scalar and vector mesons  @xcite .",
    "we use the values for the coupling constants , @xmath35 , where the former two values were obtained using the vector meson dominance model  @xcite .",
    "the form of the @xmath36 coupling respects yang s theorem  @xcite and so for spin one @xmath0 the virtual @xmath2 and @xmath37 must not be simultaneously transverse .",
    "the difference with the gauged lagrangian of ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath38 vertex amounts to adding to eq .",
    "( [ lpsiddbar ] ) a term @xmath39 .",
    "it may be of interest to investigate in future whether the meson loops investigated here might play some role in the understanding of the well known @xmath40 puzzle  @xcite .",
    "only the scalar part contributes to the @xmath0 self - energy , and the scalar potential for the @xmath0 meson is the difference of the in - medium , @xmath41 , and vacuum , @xmath42 , masses of @xmath0 , m = m^*_- m _ , [ delta - m ] with the masses obtained from m^2_= ( m^0_)^2 + ( k^2 = m^2 _ ) .",
    "[ m - psi ] here @xmath43 is the bare mass and @xmath44 is the total @xmath0 self - energy obtained from the sum of the contributions from the @xmath45 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 loops . the in - medium mass , @xmath41 , is obtained likewise , with the self - energy calculated with medium - modified @xmath1 and @xmath2 meson masses .    in the calculation , we use phenomenological form factors to regularize the self - energy loop integrals following a similar calculation for the @xmath46 self - energy  @xcite : @xmath47 for the vertices @xmath48 and @xmath49 , the form factors used are respectively , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 with @xmath53 and @xmath54 being the cutoff masses , and the common values , @xmath55 are used . for the calculation in finite nuclei , we chose two values within the range expected to be reasonable , @xmath56 and @xmath57 mev to estimate the model dependence . the scalar potential , ( @xmath58 ) , calculated via eq .

    "[ fig : total ] as a function of nuclear matter density .",
    "in this section we discuss the case that @xmath59 is placed in a finite nucleus . the nucleon density distributions for @xmath60c , @xmath61o , @xmath62ca , @xmath63zr and @xmath64pb",
    "are obtained using the qmc results for finite nuclei  @xcite . for @xmath65he",
    ", we use the parametrization for the density distribution obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite . then , using a local density approximation we calculate the @xmath0 potentials in nuclei .",
    "note that also the in - medium masses of @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons , which are necessary to estimate the @xmath0 self - energy consistently , are calculated in the qmc model .",
    "we emphasize that the same quark - meson coupling constants are used between the applied meson mean fields and the light quarks in the nucleon and those in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons  @xcite , where these coupling constants are calibrated by the nuclear matter saturation properties  @xcite .    as examples ,",
    "we show the @xmath0 potentials calculated for @xmath65he and @xmath64pb nuclei in fig .  [",
    "fig : poto - nuclei ] for the two values of the cutoff mass , @xmath66 mev and @xmath57 mev .",
    "the maximum depth of the @xmath0 potential ranges roughly from @xmath67 mev to @xmath68 mev .    using the @xmath0 potentials in nuclei obtained in this manner",
    ", we next calculate the @xmath0-nuclear bound state energies .",
    "we follow the procedure applied in the earlier work  @xcite for the @xmath69- and @xmath70-nuclear bound states . in this study , we focus entirely on the situation where the @xmath0 meson is produced nearly at rest ( recoilless kinematics in experiments ) . then , it should be a very good approximation to neglect the possible energy difference between the longitudinal and transverse components  @xcite of the @xmath0 wave function ( @xmath71 ) as was assumed for the @xmath70 meson case  @xcite . after imposing the lorentz condition , @xmath72 , to solve the proca equation , aside from a possible width , becomes equivalent to solving the klein - gordon equation with the reduced mass of the system @xmath73 in vacuum  @xcite : _",
    "( ) = 0 , [ kgequation ] where @xmath74 is the total energy of the @xmath0 meson , and @xmath75 with @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) being the vacuum mass of the @xmath0 meson ( nucleus ) .",
    "since in free space the width of @xmath0 meson is @xmath78 kev  @xcite , we can ignore this tiny natural width in the following .",
    "when the @xmath0 meson is produced nearly at rest , its dissociation process via @xmath79 is forbidden in the nucleus ( the threshold energy in free space is about @xmath80 mev above ) .",
    "this is because the same number of light quarks three participates in the initial and final states and hence , the effects of the partial restoration of chiral symmetry which reduces mostly the amount of the light quark condensates , would affect a similar total mass reduction for the initial and final states  @xcite .",
    "thus , the relative energy ( @xmath81 115 mev ) to the threshold would not be modified significantly .",
    "we also note that once the @xmath0 meson is bound in the nucleus , the total energy of the system is below threshold for nucleon knock - out and the whole system is stable .",
    "the exception to this is the process @xmath82 which is exothermic .",
    "@xcite has provided an estimate of this cross section from which we deduce a width for the bound @xmath0 of order @xmath83 mev ( nuclear matter at @xmath84 ) .",
    "we therefore expect that the bound @xmath0 , while not being completely stable under the strong interaction , should be narrow enough to be clearly observed . it would be worth while to investigate this further .",
    "then , provided that experiments can be performed to produce the @xmath0 meson in recoilless kinematics , the @xmath0 meson is expected to be captured by the nucleus into one of the bound states , which has no strong interaction originated width .",
    "this is a completely different and advantageous situation compared to that of the @xmath69 and @xmath70 meson cases  @xcite .",
    "thus , in the end , we may simply solve the klein - gordon equation with the reduced mass eq .",
    "( [ kgequation ] ) , without worrying about the width , under the situation we consider now .",
    "the calculation is carried out in momentum space by the method developed in ref .",
    "bound state energies for the @xmath0 meson , obtained solving the klein - gordon equation eq .",
    "( [ kgequation ] ) , are listed in table  [ psienergy ] .    .",
    "bound state energies calculated for the @xmath0 meson , solving the klein - gordon equation with the reduced mass eq .",
    "( [ kgequation ] ) .",
    "under the situation that the @xmath0 meson is produced in recoilless kinematics , the width due to the strong interactions is all set to zero , as well as its tiny natural width of @xmath78 kev  @xcite in free space .",
    "( see also the text . ) [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the results in table  [ psienergy ] show that the @xmath0 are expected to form nuclear bound states in all the nuclei considered .",
    "this is insensitive to the values of cutoff mass used in the form factors .",
    "it is very interesting to note that one can expect to find a @xmath0-@xmath65he bound state . it will be possible to search for this state as well as the states in a @xmath64pb nucleus at jlab after the 12 gev upgrade .",
    "in addition , one can expect quite rich spectra for medium and heavy mass nuclei .",
    "of course , the main issue is to produce the @xmath0 meson with nearly stopped kinematics , or nearly zero momentum relative to the nucleus .",
    "since the present results imply that many nuclei should form @xmath0-nuclear bound states , it may be possible to find such kinematics by careful selection of the beam and target nuclei .",
    "in this study , we have calculated the @xmath0-nuclear potentials using a local density approximation , with the inclusion of the @xmath45 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 meson loops in the @xmath0 self - energy .",
    "the nuclear density distributions , as well as the in - medium @xmath1 and @xmath2 meson masses , are consistently obtained employing the quark - meson coupling model . in the model",
    ", all the coupling constants between the applied meson mean fields and the light quarks in the nucleon , as well as those in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons , are all equal and calibrated by the nuclear matter saturation properties . using the @xmath0-nuclear potentials obtained in this manner , we have solved the klein - gordon equation which is reduced from the proca equation , and obtained the @xmath0-nuclear bound state energies .",
    "for this , we have been able to set the strong interaction width of the @xmath0 meson to be zero ( and neglect its tiny natural width of @xmath78 kev in free space ) . combined with the generally advocated color - octet gluon - based attraction , or qcd color van der waals forces",
    ", we expect that the @xmath0 meson will form nuclear bound states and that the signal for the formation should be experimentally very clear , provided that the @xmath0 meson is produced in recoilless kinematics .",
