    "one of the main tasks of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) will be the search for the higgs particle  @xcite , which is responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "a lower limit @xmath2114 gev was put on the higgs mass by the non - observation of the so - called  higgs - strahlung ",
    "process @xmath3 at lep  @xcite .",
    "since radiative corrections to electroweak observables vary with @xmath4 , a global @xmath5-fit of high - precision electroweak measurements performed at lepton and hadron colliders allows an indirect measure of the higgs mass : the upper limit @xmath6 160 gev has been obtained at 95% confidence level ( @xmath7=2.7)@xcite .",
    "a considerable effort has been devoted in recent years to improve the theoretical predictions both for the production mechanisms and the main background processes , hopefully leading to an overall improvement of the search strategies at the lhc .",
    "this brief review is intended to summarize the status of the qcd corrections to higgs boson production and decay at the lhc , and to present the main discovery strategies at atlas and cms .",
    "in fig .  [ hprod ] ( left ) , taken from @xcite , the relevant cross sections for higgs production at the lhc are shown as a function of the higgs mass .",
    "the results refer to fully inclusive cross sections and no acceptance cuts or branching ratios are applied . in this section ,",
    "we describe the state - of - the - art of theoretical calculations for the main production channels .          at the lhc , mainly because of the large gluon luminosity , the dominant production channel over the entire mass range will be the gluon fusion process @xmath8 , where the higgs couples to gluons through a heavy - quark loop . the total cross section at leading - order ( lo ) in qcd perturbation theory ( @xmath9 ) was computed more than 30 years ago @xcite .",
    "the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections @xcite yield a k - factor of about 80 - 100% , thus making a nnlo calculation explicitly needed .",
    "the complexity involved with the heavy - quark loop makes the computation of higher - order corrections extremely difficult .",
    "considerable simplifications arise in the large-@xmath10 limit ( @xmath11 ) , where it is possible to introduce an effective lagrangian @xcite directly coupling the higgs to gluons : @xmath12 \\ { \\rm tr } \\ { \\cal g}_{\\mu\\nu } { \\cal g}^{\\mu\\nu } , \\ ] ]    where the coefficient @xmath13 is known up to @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "it was shown  @xcite that nlo calculations based on the effective lagrangian approximate the full nlo result within 10% up to @xmath15=1 tev .",
    "the reason for the high accuracy of this approximation is the fact that the higgs particle is predominantly produced in association with partons of relatively low transverse - momenta , which are unable to resolve the heavy - quark loop @xcite .",
    "the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) corrections have been evaluated in the large-@xmath10 limit @xcite . in the case of a light higgs boson ( @xmath16 100 - 200 gev ) ,",
    "the k - factor with respect to nlo is about 10 - 25% and the scale dependence is reduced to 10 - 15% , thus improving the convergence of the perturbative series .",
    "higher - order perturbative contributions can be reliably estimated by resumming multiple soft - gluon emission : the resummation program has been carried out at the full next - to - next - to - logarithmic ( nnll ) level @xcite and at the @xmath17 level @xcite , providing a further 7 - 8% increase w.r.t .",
    "nnlo and reducing scale dependence to less than 4% .",
    "also the nlo ew contributions have been computed  @xcite , showing a 5 - 8% effect below the @xmath18 threshold .",
    "realistic experimental analysis , including exact kinematics of the final states , are only possible if reliable theoretical predictions for the higgs differential ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) distributions are available",
    ". the most advanced predictions at present are the nnlo fully exclusive distribution @xcite and the parton level event generator ( including higgs decays ) ` hnnlo ` @xcite . in the region of small transverse - momentum , in addition to these fixed - order results",
    ", @xmath19-resummation has been performed at the nnll level with inclusion of the rapidity dependence@xcite , while joint ( threshold and @xmath19 ) resummation has been performed at the full nll level @xcite , leading to very precise predictions and to an overall excellent convergence of the perturbative result .",
    "this production mechanism occurs as the scattering between two ( anti)quarks with weak boson ( @xmath21 or @xmath22 ) exchange in the t - channel and with the higgs boson radiated off the weak - boson propagator .",
    "even though the higgs vbf production cross section is somewhat smaller ( @xmath23 20% ) than the gluon fusion one , several phenomenological features make vbf a very promising channel for the lhc :    * since the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) of the incoming valence quarks peak at values of the momentum fractions @xmath24 0.1 to 0.2 , this process tends to produce two highly - energetic outgoing quarks ; * the large weak boson mass provides a natural cutoff on its propagator : as a consequence , the jets from the two outgoing quarks are produced with a transverse energy of the order of a fraction of the weak boson mass and thus with a large rapidity interval between them ( typically one at forward and the other at backward rapidity ) ; * since the exchanged weak boson is colourless , no further hadronic production occurs in the rapidity interval between the quark jets ( except for the higgs decay products ) .",
    "the lo partonic cross section can be found in @xcite .",
    "gluon radiation can only occur as bremsstrahlung off the quark legs : nlo corrections to higgs production via vbf have been computed for the total cross section  @xcite and for higgs production in association with two jets  @xcite .",
    "they have been found to be typically modest ( 5 - 10% ) and the scale uncertainty is at the percent level , mainly because of the good precision to which the valence quark pdfs in the intermediate - x regions are known .",
    "the higgs boson is radiated off one of the two tops in the @xmath25 s - channel or off the top propagator in the @xmath26 t - channel at lo .",
    "this channel can be important in the low - mass region ( provided a good @xmath27-tagging and a high luminosity are reached ) , where it allows to search for @xmath28 decay and can be useful to measure the @xmath29 yukawa coupling .",
    "the qcd corrections to the lo cross section ( computed in @xcite ) involve the computation of massive pentagons and enhance the cross section by @xmath23 20% , with a residual scale dependence of @xmath23 15%  @xcite .",
    "in fig .  [ hprod ] ( right ) the branching ratios are shown as function of the higgs mass for the low - intermediate higgs mass region 100 gev @xmath30 200 gev , favourite by the electroweak precision measurements  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the low higgs mass region is the most challenging for the higgs detection because the biggest higgs branching ratios ( br ) are into heavy quarks or @xmath31 leptons  @xcite , which are difficult to be disentangled from the huge qcd background .",
    "+ for very low higgs mass ( @xmath32  120 gev ) the @xmath33 decay channel ( br @xmath34 ) is exploited in the associated higgs production with @xmath35 .",
    "the request of two additional top quarks helps to cut the huge amount of @xmath36 qcd background but it makes the final state very complex ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "+ for higgs mass up to 130 gev the most promising decays are into photons and @xmath31 leptons .",
    "both the channels have high background rate due to fakes , therefore they are also studied in the vbf production of the higgs to achieve a better significance . the decay @xmath38 is known up to 3-loop qcd @xcite , while the irreducible @xmath39 background is available at nlo in the program diphox @xcite , which also includes all relevant photon fragmentation effects .",
    "the loop - mediated process @xmath40 contributes about 30% to the background and has been calculated at @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "atlas and cms study this channel in all the combinations of the @xmath21 decays : @xmath42 with @xmath43  0.02  pb , @xmath44 with @xmath43  0.10  pb , @xmath45 with @xmath43  0.20  pb , where @xmath46 stays for @xmath47 or @xmath48 .",
    "these final states involve many systematics ( _ e.g. _ , effect of alignment on @xmath27-tagging , jet and missing energy calibration ) which need to be measured from the data using dedicated control samples .",
    "moreover , in addition to the physics qcd background ( @xmath35+jets with @xmath43 350 pb , @xmath49 with @xmath43 3.3 pb ) , there is a big amount of combinatorial background due to the crowding of these final states .",
    "therefore multivariate analysis techniques must be used to recognize the @xmath27-jets coming from the higgs decay .",
    "both the experiments quote a quite low significance for the higgs discovery in this channel with 30 fb@xmath1 : the most recent results are from cms  @xcite and indicate a significance smaller than 1 for the combined analysis , considering all the systematics ; the atlas analysis is quite old , it relays on a fast simulation of the detector and it quotes a significance of about 2 - 3 for the semileptonic final state only  @xcite .",
    "however the analysis of this channel suffers of some drawbacks which can be solved in the future . the low trigger efficiency ( mainly in the fully hadronic final state )",
    "can be raised with a dedicated , more complex trigger menu .",
    "the @xmath27-tagging performances are optimal for jets with @xmath50  80  gev , while this channel contains many low @xmath51 jets . on this kind of jets",

    "the signal cross section is about @xmath63 fb at @xmath55 gev , thus being three orders of magnitude below the cross section for @xmath62+jet final state from background processes , and a factor @xmath64 below the one for jet+jet final state .",
    "this calls for severe requirements in terms of jet and @xmath65 rejection .",
    "+ cms will use isolation contraints against jets , while @xmath65 rejection will be based on a neural network using as input several variables related to shower shapes , plus the information from pre - shower detectors in the endcaps .",
    "an extensive use of the calorimeter transverse granularity , of hadronic leakage and shower shape parameters , will allow atlas to achieve a total rejection factor of about 3000 for @xmath62 efficiency of @xmath66 .",
    "+ given the amount of material in the inner trackers of the two experiments , photon conversions are not negligible in these studies , but must be recovered by means of dedicated reconstruction algorithms .",

    "the high background rate for this final state makes it impossible to study the @xmath26 production channel .",
    "both experiments are thus focusing on vbf production where the additional jets in the final state allow to improve significantly the signal over background ratio , compensating for the smaller production cross section : @xmath69 fb at @xmath70 gev .",

    "+ for leptonic and semi - leptonic final states , trigger menus based on single leptons and single leptons plus @xmath31s will be used , while for the fully hadronic decay channel , the most promising trigger configuration is @xmath31 plus missing @xmath74 .",
    "+ the vbf production channel allows for forward jet tagging , where the event is searched through looking for the two additional quark initiated jets , which are typically located in opposite hemispheres and have high @xmath51 values .",
