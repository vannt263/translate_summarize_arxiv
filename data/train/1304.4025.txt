    "the early embryos of many species , including _ drosophila _  @xcite , _ xenopus _",
    "@xcite , _ oryzias _  @xcite , _ fundulus _",
    "@xcite , and zebrafish  @xcite , exhibit metachronous mitosis , in which mitosis progresses as a wavefront through the embryo .",
    "such wavefronts are reminiscent of biochemical wavefronts that are used to transmit signals across many cells in other biological systems , such as wavefronts of the molecule camp that propagate in a colony of _ dictyostelium _ when it begins to aggregate to form a fruiting body  @xcite . propagating wavefronts ,",
    "however , need not be purely biochemical in origin .",
    "the process of mitosis is a highly mechanical one that involves significant changes in the volume occupied by chromatin  @xcite as well as separation of chromosomes  @xcite .",
    "this raises the question of whether mitotic wavefronts are purely biochemical phenomena or whether they might have a mechanical component as well .",
    "the nuclei of the _ drosophila _ embryo are syncytial ( i.e. , they share the same cytoplasm and are not separated into individual cells by plasma membranes ) during their first thirteen division cycles .",
    "the nuclei migrate to the egg s surface during the ninth cycle .",
    "there they divide five more times , until the fourteenth cycle , when cell membranes form and gastrulation begins  @xcite .",
    "mitotic wavefronts are observed in cycles 9 through 13  @xcite . in this period ,",
    "chemical diffusion is unhindered by membrane barriers .",
    "for example , it is known that calcium , a signal carrier that influences many local phenomena including mitosis  @xcite , exhibits spikes of concentration in the syncytial embryo  @xcite that have been resolved into a wavefront that travels across the embryo at the same speed as the mitotic wavefront  @xcite .    however , mitosis is also a mechanical phenomenon . in the syncytial embryo ,",
    "nuclei are embedded in an elastic cytoskeleton , which contains both actin and microtubules  @xcite .",
    "actin caps assemble around each of the nuclei at the end of interphase , and provide anchor points for the mitotic spindles that pull the two daughter nuclei apart  @xcite .",
    "recent work shows that mechanical interactions are important for re - organization of the nuclei after mitosis  @xcite , and optical tweezer experiments show that nuclei are mechanically coupled  @xcite .",
    "moreover , mechanical deformations of the embryo are known to be able to induce morphogen expression  @xcite .",
    "however , little is known about how mechanical interactions affect collective phenomena such as mitotic wavefronts at the level of the entire embryo .    in this paper",
    "we report the results of both our image analysis of wavefronts in early _ drosophila _ embryos , and our theoretical studies of models of wavefront propagation . using novel tracking techniques , we analyzed confocal microscopy videos taken of _ drosophila _ embryos in which the nuclear dna / chromosomes are visualized by labeling their histones with gfp .",
    "our analysis yields the position , shape and dynamics of the dna / chromosomes with high temporal and spatial resolution during cycles 914 .",
    "we observe two distinct markers of the mitotic process in each cycle , one corresponding to the onset of metaphase ( at which point the chromosomes condense in the nuclear midplane , known as the metaphasic plate , see figure  [ fig : cyclestages ] for an illustration of the different stages ) and one corresponding to the onset of anaphase . both onsets exhibit identical wavefront patterns , indicating that they are indeed two markers of the same process .",
    "both onsets are also followed by displacements in the positions of the nuclei that also exhibit the same wavefront patterns . finally , we find that the wavefront speed slows down from one cycle to the next .",
    "we treat the embryo theoretically as an excitable medium , consisting of nuclei that can be triggered into initiating metaphase or anaphase , thereby locally exciting the medium and thus signaling their neighbors .",
    "we not only consider the well - known case of nonlinear wavefront propagation in a chemically excitable medium  @xcite , but introduce a model for the early embryo as a _ mechanically _ excitable medium  @xcite , through which mitotic wavefronts can propagate via stress diffusion .",
    "comparing the data with the results of these two models , we find that our observations are difficult to reconcile with a purely biochemical scenario .",
    "in such a scenario , the wavefront speed has a tendency to _ increase _ with nuclear density , and thus with cycle , contrary to our observations .",
    "the observations can , however , be explained quite naturally by a novel scenario in which nuclei not only respond to their mechanical environment , but also actively use it to signal each other .",
    "our results suggest that mitotic wavefronts in syncytial _",
    "embryos may constitute one example of a previously unexplored form of mechanical signaling via nonlinear wavefronts that could also arise in very different biological contexts  @xcite .",
    "an example image of detected nuclei in a _ drosophila _",
    "embryo is shown in figure  [ fig : expdata]a . in each cycle , as the nuclei progress from interphase through metaphase to anaphase , the detected shape of the dna / chromosomes changes in a well - defined manner ( figure  [ fig : expdata]b ) .",
    "newly separated nuclei are small and spherical , and thus show up in our shape tracking as small circles . during interphase ,",
    "the nuclear dna grows in size over time as it is duplicated . at the onset of metaphase , the chromosomes condense in the midplane of the nucleus , and appear to elongate into an ellipse .",
    "the final step of mitosis , the onset of anaphase , corresponds to two detectable changes in the shape : a sudden shift of the orientation axis over a @xmath0 angle , and a change of aspect ratio .",
    "an example plot showing the ratio of the length of the two axes as a function of time during a cell cycle is given in figure  [ fig : expdata]c .",
    "the onsets of metaphase and anaphase , as determined by the axes ratio ( figure  [ fig : expdata]d ) are indicated by dotted blue lines and dashed orange lines , respectively .",
    "evidently the onset of metaphase exhibits a wavefront pattern , or rather two wavefronts , one propagating from each pole .",
    "the two wavefronts do not necessarily start at the same time .",
    "the onset of anaphase exhibits the same wavefront pattern .",
    "mitotic waves were first observed by foe and alberts  @xcite ; with better time resolution , it is evident that these wavefronts can be resolved into two distinct markers of mitosis , corresponding to the onsets of metaphase and anaphase .",
    "there may well be additional markers that can not be resolved via histone labeling alone ; for example , the work of parry et al .",
    "@xcite indicates that calcium may provide another marker for the mitotic process , and we find that the nuclear displacements also provide markers ( see below ) .",
    "the processes of metaphase and anaphase affect not only the shapes of the chromosomes , but also their positions .",
    "after each of the shape changes , the nuclei move _ collectively _ through the embryo , almost exclusively along the long axis ( which we designate as the @xmath1-axis ) , resulting in a global ` breathing mode ' of the entire embryo ( see si movie  1  @xcite ) .",
    "remarkably , after an initial transition in which the nuclei re - organize after anaphase ( studied in detail by kanesaki et al .",
    "@xcite ) , the nuclei hardly move with respect to their nearest neighbors during this collective movement .",
    "figure  [ fig : expdata]e shows the average displacement @xmath2 along the @xmath1-axis of a small set of nuclei .",
    "figure  [ fig : expdata]f shows the same motion for all nuclei .",
    "note that there are subtle changes in the gray scale that parallel the metaphasic and anaphasic wavefronts but that are shifted to the right ( i.e. occur later in time ) with respect to each of those wavefronts .",
    "this illustrates that the nuclear displacements follow the same wavefront pattern as the axes ratio , so that the displacements also serve as markers for the mitotic wavefront .",
    "the existence of such a marker in the displacements as well as in the axes ratio and in calcium concentration underlines the important interplay of mechanics and biochemistry in the mitotic process .",
    "the displacement response to the onsets of metaphase and anaphase causes the nuclei to move to new equilibrium positions ( figure  [ fig : expdata]e ) . note that the relaxation time of this response is fairly long , about half the length of the mitotic phase ( @xmath3 ) for the onset of metaphase and about half the length of the following interphase ( up to @xmath4 ) for the actual divisions .",
    "the displacements following the onset of metaphase therefore occur before the cytoskeletal reconstruction process , which takes place during anaphase , whereas the displacements following the onset of anaphase happen during the aftermath of the cytoskeleton reconstruction .",
    "we quantify the wavefront speeds in figure  [ fig : wavefronts ] for two sets of movies , where the environmental conditions ( in particular the temperature ) were approximately the same for all movies in a given set , but differed between the two sets ( the data of the two sets were taken several months apart ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : wavefronts]a shows an example of a position vs. time plot of all metaphase ( blue diamonds ) and anaphase ( red pluses ) onset events in a single cycle of a single embryo .",
    "the slope , corresponding to the wavefront speed , is clearly constant across the embryo .",
    "figure  [ fig : wavefronts]b shows the ratio of the speeds of the wavefronts as measured by the onsets of metaphase and anaphase of all embryos , showing that for a given embryo and cycle , these are identical , confirming that they are two markers of a single process .",
    "from embryo to embryo there are large variations in wavefront speed ( figure  [ fig : wavefronts]c ) , but they all show a consistent reduction in speed from one cycle to the next . this trend is illustrated in figure  [ fig : wavefronts]e , where we plot the same data , normalized by the speed of the first wavefront , on a log - linear scale .",
    "although our data only span a single decade , this figure suggests that the decrease of wavefront speed with cycle number is consistent with a decaying exponential .",
    "figure  [ fig : wavefronts]d shows that the time interval that separates the onset of metaphase from the onset of anaphase is the same for all cycles for a given embryo , but is different for the two different sets of data . by looking at the point at which the nuclear envelope breaks down and reforms , foe and",
    "alberts  @xcite also found that the duration of the mitotic phase is constant through cycles 10 , 11 and 12 ( 3 minutes in their observations , comparable to our result ) , but was longer for cycle 13 ( 5 minutes ) .",
    "the re - formation of the nuclear envelope membrane may therefore take significantly longer in the last syncytial cycle , even though the actual mitotic processes continue to follow the pattern of the earlier cycles .",
    "the nuclei on the surface are separated by a well - defined distance @xmath5 , which decreases with cycle number @xmath6 . because the number of nuclei doubles from one cycle to the next , it is not surprising that @xmath5 decays exponentially , scaling like @xmath7 , with @xmath6 the cycle number and @xmath8 the number of the first observed cycle .",
    "we consistently found a value of @xmath9 in our experiments ( figure  [ fig : wavefronts]f and table  [ table : expdata ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath10 is slightly less than @xmath11 , presumably because the curved embryo is being projected onto a plane .",
    "we have also measured the duration of each cycle , @xmath12 , and found that , over the observed cycles , it increases with cycle number @xmath6 , with a weak exponential growth : @xmath13 , where @xmath14 for set  1 and @xmath15 for set  2 , see table  [ table : expdata ] and figure  [ fig : cycleduration ] .    .",

    "our observation that the mitotic wavefronts propagate at constant speed across the embryo suggests that the embryo can be considered as an excitable medium that supports nonlinear front propagation .",
    "alternatively , the nuclei could all have biological clocks that determine when mitosis starts , which operate independently ; in that case the wavefront would be only a result of a lucky timing of those clocks .",
    "we discuss various timing models and show that they are inconsistent with our observations in the supplementary material . here",
    "we concentrate on two distinct classes of models for front propagation in excitable media . in the first model",
    "the nuclei communicate by releasing a small chemical species , which then diffuses to neighboring nuclei , triggering them to initiate mitosis . in the second model we explore the novel idea that mitotic wavefronts in the early embryo can be described by wavefront propagation in a medium that is _ mechanically _ rather than _ chemically _ excitable . in this model ,",
    "forces exerted at the onset of the mitotic phase give rise to mechanical stresses that trigger other nuclei to proceed to mitosis as well .      at the end of a cycle ,",
    "when all nuclei have completed the duplication of their dna , we assume that they are in an excitable state , meaning that they can be triggered to initiate mitosis once they receive an appropriate signal .",
    "an obvious candidate for signaling between nuclei is a small protein ( _ e.g. _ a cdk , cyclin or some other activator ) , which we will denote as @xmath22 . by definition",
    ", nuclei can divide only once per cycle ; therefore , in our model , we introduce a refractory period for each nucleus following anaphase , equal to the duration of the interphase .    to introduce chemical excitability , we assume that if the local concentration of @xmath22 exceeds a threshold @xmath23 , the nucleus starts its program of mitosis , part of which involves releasing more @xmath22 . @xmath22",
    "then diffuses away , raising the concentration of @xmath22 at neighboring nuclei , and so on . in our model",
    "we allow for a time delay  @xmath24 between trigger and release , meaning that a nucleus does not release more @xmath22 until a time @xmath24 after its local concentration exceeds  @xmath23 . we model releases of @xmath22 by the nuclei ( or sources ) as localized pulses ( dirac delta functions ) , and the system is initiated with a single nucleus releasing a quantity  @xmath25 of @xmath22 .",
    "the wavefront at any point in time corresponds to the position of all nuclei that release @xmath22 at that moment .",
    "details on how to solve the diffusion equation and carry out the other needed calculations are given the appendices .",
    "an example wavefront is shown in figure  [ fig : models]a .    in the case of zero delay time , the speed  @xmath26 of the resulting wavefront is determined by three parameters : the diffusion constant  @xmath27 , the nuclear spacing  @xmath28 and the concentration threshold  @xmath23 .",
    "we obtained the value of  @xmath28 from direct measurements ( figure  [ fig : wavefronts]f ) .",
    "gregor et al .",
    "@xcite found from diffusion experiments in _ drosophila _ that the diffusion constant of a molecule with hydrodynamic radius @xmath29 is well described by a modified stokes - einstein relation  @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath32 the temperature , @xmath33 the effective viscosity of the syncytial _",
    "drosophila _ embryo , and",
    "@xmath34 is an experimentally determined constant . using this expression",
    ", we estimate that a reasonable value for the diffusion coefficient ( from the size of the activator @xmath22 ) , would correspond to a chemical with a radius of approximately @xmath35 and therefore a diffusion constant of about @xmath36 .    combining the parameters of our model",
    ", we define a nondimensional threshold and speed : @xmath37 in a three - dimensional model the power of @xmath28 in equation  ( [ eq : defbaralpha ] ) is 3 . as shown in appendix  [",
    "sec : biochemwavefronts ] , for a steady - state wavefront , we then have @xmath38 , where @xmath39 increases monotonically with @xmath40 ( figure  [ fig : taualphanodelay ] ) . consequently ,",
    "if both @xmath27 and @xmath23 are fixed , the wavefront speed @xmath26 increases as the nuclear spacing  @xmath28 decreases , and thus the speed increases with cell cycle , in direct contradiction to our experimental observations .",
    "thus , the simplest form of the biochemical signaling model can not describe the data of figure  [ fig : wavefronts]c .",
    "we next consider the possibility of a delay  @xmath24 between the time when the local concentration of @xmath22 reaches the threshold value  @xmath23 , and the instant when more @xmath22 is released . in the limit where @xmath41 , the wavefront speed is determined by diffusion as before , @xmath42 . in the opposite limit , @xmath43",
    ", we find @xmath44 , so @xmath26 would decrease with cycle number for constant @xmath24 .",
    "we find that for our system , introducing a small , fixed delay time of @xmath45 puts us in the crossover regime between these two types of behavior .",
    "consequently , the model predicts that for the first few cycles , the wavefront speed should increase , whereas it should level off or slightly decrease in the last cycle .",
    "changing the value of the threshold  @xmath23 does not qualitatively change this result . changing the value of the diffusion constant  @xmath27 simply shifts the position of the crossover .",
    "a key result of our analysis with a fixed time delay is that a physically unrealistic diffusion coefficient is required in order to reproduce our experimental observations . in order to obtain a strictly decreasing wavefront speed for the range of interest ,",
    "a diffusion constant of more than @xmath46 is required .",
    "this corresponds to a signaling particle that is even smaller than an ion .",
    "thus , a biochemical - signaling model with a time delay that is independent of cell cycle can not describe our observations either ( figure  [ fig : models]b ) .",
    "we also investigated the wavefront speed in the case where the delay time is allowed to vary from one cycle to the next .",
    "naturally , given a value for the diffusion constant and the threshold , for each cycle we can find a delay time such that the speed predicted by the model matches the observed speed ; these values are listed in table  [ table : diffmodelfits ] .",
    "the found values do not show any consistent trend , and differ quite strongly between the two data sets .",
    "there is no obvious explanation for what would set the time delay in each cycle ; the time delay is not proportional to the total duration of the cycle ( which increases from one cycle to the next ) or any other obvious time scale .",
    "therefore , this procedure simply shifts the problem from understanding the trend in the wavefront speed to understanding the trend in the delay time , and does not provide a satisfactory explanation of our data .    on the basis of these results ,",
    "we conclude that it is very unlikely that a wavefront that propagates via diffusion of some chemical species would slow down with cycle number , as observed in our experiments .",
    "we also note that any model in which the biochemical signal is mediated by a method that is faster than diffusion ( such as active transport ) suffers from the same problem : the predicted wavespeed would go up with increasing cycle , because the spacing between the nuclei goes down",
    ".      the early embryo can not support ordinary elastic waves because it is heavily damped by the viscosity of the cytosol .",
    "consequently , displacements do not propagate ballistically as in a wave , but diffusively .",
    "however , just as diffusion of @xmath22 can lead to nonlinear wavefront propagation in the biochemical signaling model , diffusion of displacement could lead to wavefront propagation in a mechanical signaling model .",
    "we therefore introduce a model in which the nuclei communicate via stresses or strains that they exert on the cytoskeleton at the initiation of the mitotic phase . for example",
    ", these could be the forces that cause the chromosomes to condense into sister chromatids in prophase or to align in the nuclear midplane at the onset of metaphase .    in our model ,",
    "a nucleus starts its program when the largest eigenvalue of the local stress tensor exceeds a threshold value  @xmath23 .",
    "we describe the cytoskeleton as a homogeneous linear elastic medium , characterized by two elastic parameters , for example its bulk and shear moduli ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively ) or equivalently the young s modulus  @xmath49 and dimensionless poisson ratio  @xmath50 .",
    "the viscous fluid in which the elastic cytoskeleton is immersed exerts a drag force on it , characterized by a damping constant  @xmath51 .",
    "assuming that the nuclei exist in a thin layer near the surface of the embryo , we denote the deformations in the plane of the layer by @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) , where the deformation maps point @xmath54 onto point @xmath55 . in the overdamped limit ( zero reynolds number ) , the displacement @xmath56 of a nucleus can be described by  @xcite : @xmath57 the term on the left represents the damping with damping factor  @xmath51 , and the two terms on the right are the elastic force per unit volume . equation  ( [ eq : model ] ) is reminiscent of the diffusion equation : a time derivative on the left equals second - order space derivatives on the right .",
    "this model can therefore be thought of as describing the diffusion of the vector displacement field  @xmath58 .",
    "the right hand side of equation  ( [ eq : model ] ) gives rise to two quantities with the dimensions of diffusion constants  @xcite : @xmath59    in order to introduce _ mechanical excitability _ into the model , we assume that if the largest eigenvalue of the stress tensor at a nucleus at position @xmath60 exceeds a threshold value , @xmath23 , at time @xmath61 , it triggers the nucleus into action which involves adding additional stress to the system .",
    "this stress can be added in the form of a source term @xmath62 , a symmetric tensor of rank 2 , corresponding to a force per unit volume @xmath63 acting over a distance @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath65 is therefore the symmetric combination of a force and a distance , with the dimensions of a stress ( force per unit area ) , so it represents a stress source . in two dimensions",
    ", @xmath65 has an isotropic part of the form @xmath66 and a traceless anisotropic part of the form @xmath67 where @xmath68 indicates the anisotropy direction . if @xmath68 makes an angle  @xmath69 with the @xmath1-axis , we find that the components of @xmath65 in matrix notation are given by : @xmath70 here @xmath71 is the two - dimensional dirac delta function .",
    "similar active force dipoles have previously been introduced into other tissue - level models , such as those of bischofs et al .",
    "@xcite and ranft et al .",
    "@xcite . to include the force due to the added stress at @xmath72 and @xmath73 , we add the term @xmath74 to the right hand side of equation  ( [ eq : model ] ) : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the heaviside step function .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : modelwithsource ] ) essentially describes the diffusion of the vector displacement field  @xmath58 due to a tensor source term .",
    "it is similar , but not identical , to a scalar reaction - diffusion equation , which describes the evolution of a scalar concentration field  @xmath77 due to a scalar source term .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that the model described by equation  ( [ eq : model ] ) also produces wavefronts , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : models]c and d.    in order to compare the model results with the data , we need to estimate the values of the elastic constants and the damping parameter .",
    "the speed  @xmath26 now depends on the quantity @xmath78 that determines the dimensional part of both diffusion constants ( equation  ( [ eq : stressdiffconst ] ) ) , as well as the nuclear spacing  @xmath28 , the strengths  @xmath79 and @xmath80 of the source term , and the threshold value  @xmath23 .",
    "it is well known that the values of both the elastic and the viscous modulus of a polymer network depend strongly on filament concentration  @xcite , which can differ from one cycle to the next . because the number of nuclei doubles in each cycle , the number of actin caps in the network doubles as well ( see figures  [ fig : cyclestages ] and [ fig : embryocrossection ] ) .",
    "thus , the local concentration of actin and of microtubules should effectively double with cycle number @xmath6 .",
    "we therefore write @xmath81 , where as before @xmath8 is the number of the first observed cycle .",
    "both the storage and loss moduli of polymer networks increase with concentration approximately as power laws , but the actual powers are debated  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in each successive cycle the nuclei get pushed further out into the plasma membrane encompassing the entire embryo  @xcite , increasing the friction coefficient . because the dynamics of our system depend only on the value of the two effective diffusion constants given in equation  ( [ eq : stressdiffconst ] )",
    ", we will not be able to distinguish the dependence of the storage and loss moduli independently .",
    "instead we assume a dependence @xmath82 .",
    "we will use @xmath83 as a fit parameter .",
    "because of the mathematical similarity between the mechanical - signaling model ( equation ( [ eq : model ] ) ) and the diffusion model for concentration fields , we can use the same type of dimensional analysis as for the biochemical - signaling model .",
    "we again use the dimensionless threshold  @xmath84 and wavefront speed  @xmath85 defined by equations  ( [ eq : defbaralpha ] ) and  ( [ eq : defbarv ] ) , where @xmath25 is now the typical strength of the source term , and we write @xmath86 .",
    "we determine @xmath87 numerically , and find that it can be well described by the functional form @xmath88 , where @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 are constants that depend on the choice of source term and boundary conditions  @xcite . in the analysis that follows ,",
    "we have adopted boundary conditions that are free along the long axis and periodic along the short axis to mimic the elongated shape of the embryo .",
    "figure  [ fig : models]e shows a fit to a displacement wavefront profile following the first detectable sign of the mitotic wavefront ( onset of metaphase ) in the initial ( tenth ) cycle .",
    "we find that in order to fit the profile , the source term  ( [ eq : sourceterm ] ) must be nearly isotropic , so that @xmath92 .",
    "we therefore set @xmath93 and fit to find the threshold stress , which gives @xmath94 , with @xmath95 the spacing in cycle 10 .",
    "thus , the threshold stress is approximately ten percent of the force exerted per unit area .    figure  [ fig : models]f shows a fit of the wavefront speed of the two datasets , @xmath93 and @xmath96 . here , the fit parameter is the exponent @xmath83 that governs the change in the displacement diffusion constant from cycle to cycle .",
    "both datasets are well - described with a value of @xmath97 .",
    "the only difference between the two datasets is the value of the displacement diffusion constant @xmath98 in the 10th cycle , which is about @xmath99 for set  1 and about @xmath100 for set  2 .",
    "these values for the diffusion constant are comparable to those found in microrheology experiments , which have measured the frequency - dependent complex shear modulus in a variety of living cells  @xcite . in contrast to",
    "pure actin networks , living systems often do not exhibit a low - frequency plateau in the storage modulus @xmath101 .",
    "although this makes a precise determination of the shear modulus difficult , we can still get a decent order - of - magnitude estimate from the experimental data at @xmath102 .",
    "the damping constant @xmath51 is given by @xmath103  @xcite , where @xmath77 is the filament concentration , @xmath104  @xcite is the ambient fluid viscosity , and @xmath105 is the mesh size of the actin network .",

    ", we find that @xmath83 should be somewhere between @xmath111 ( for an entangled f - actin solution ) and @xmath112 ( for a semidilute solution ) .",
    "our value of @xmath97 indicates that our system falls somewhere in between these two regimes , which is reasonable for the _ drosophila _ embryo , with its hemispherical actin caps enclosing each nucleus ( see figure  [ fig : embryocrossection ] ) .",
    "figures  [ fig : models]e and f show that we can consistently fit both the wavefront velocity and the displacement profile of the nuclei as a function of time immediately after the metaphasic wavefront , with the same theory .",

    "the fact that we can fit both quantities with the same parameters therefore provides strong evidence in favor of the mechanical signaling model .",

    "moreover , although either the displacement or the velocity data can be fit with different combinations of the threshold and diffusion constant , the numbers given above are the only ones for which we can fit both quantities .    in summary , the mechanical signaling model agrees much better with the data than the biochemical signaling model in two important respects .",
    "first , it captures the dependence of the wavefront velocity on cell cycle number while the biochemical signaling model does not . from dimensional analysis ,",
    "we have shown for both models that the wavefront velocity depends mainly on @xmath113 , where @xmath27 is the diffusion constant and @xmath28 is the average distance between nuclei .",
    "note that @xmath28 decreases with cycle number . in the case of biochemical signaling ,",
    "the chemical diffusion coefficient @xmath27 remains constant with cycle number , leading to a wavefront velocity that tends to _ increase _ with cycle number .",
    "in the case of mechanical signaling , however , the displacement diffusion coefficient , @xmath98 , decreases quite strongly with cycle number because the damping coefficient , @xmath51 , should increase more rapidly with filament concentration than the elastic constant , @xmath48 .",
    "if we make the reasonable assumption that the filament concentration increases with cycle number , then this means that the stress diffusion coefficient decreases with cycle number , leading to a wavefront velocity that decreases with cycle number , in accord with experimental observations .",
    "second , we have shown that the mechanical signaling model describes not only the wavefront velocity but also the displacement profile following the metaphasic wavefront . in the biochemical - signaling model",
    ", a separate mechanical description would be necessary in order to describe the nuclear displacements .",
    "finally , we note that we have assumed that the elastic constants and damping coefficients vary from cycle to cycle but do not change much during the period that we are focusing on .",
    "however , the cytoskeleton reconstructs completely during the cell cycle .",
    "our analysis will apply as long as the elastic constants and damping coefficient do not change appreciably from the time that the original triggering wavefront is generated to the time that the anaphasic wavefront occurs .",
    "thus , the assumption is that cytoskeletal reconstruction occurs sometime during anaphase and is finished before the process of mitosis begins in the next cycle . in particular , this also means that our model should not be able to correctly predict the much larger displacements following anaphase ( see figure  [ fig : expdata]e ) , which indeed it can not .    .",

    "during the early cycles of _ drosophila _ development , the cycles of the nuclei are strongly coupled across the entire embryo by mitotic wavefronts that travel at constant speed across the embryo .",
    "we summarize our observations as follows :    1 .",
    "there are several markers of the mitotic process in each cycle , corresponding to the onsets of metaphase and anaphase , which are visible as wavefronts that travel across the embryo ( figure  [ fig : expdata]d ) .",
    "2 .   the speed of the mitotic wavefronts slows down in each successive cycle ( figures  [ fig : wavefronts]c and  [ fig : wavefronts]e ) .",
    "the onsets of metaphase and anaphase both trigger a mechanical response of the entire embryo in the form of displacements of the nuclei that also exhibit a wavefront pattern ( figure  [ fig : expdata]f ) .",
    "in addition to these observations , we add those of parry et al .",
    "@xcite :    1 .",
    "there is a visible wavefront in calcium release that coincides with the onset of anaphase .",
    "2 .   the speed of the calcium wavefront slows down in each successive cycle , presumably matching the speed of the mitotic wavefront .",
    "we have considered two scenarios to assess whether they are consistent with these observations . in both cases , based on observations ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 5 ) , we take the observed metaphase , anaphase and calcium wavefronts to be different markers of the same mitotic process , and assume that the mitotic wavefront is triggered by a single event .",
    "_ mitosis is triggered by a biochemical signal .",
    "_ here we assume that a biochemical signal is responsible for triggering mitosis .",
    "the signal is mediated by the release and subsequent diffusion of a small ion , molecule or protein .",
    "the only chemical species that is known to exhibit a wavefront pattern during mitosis is calcium .",
    "however , because the onset of metaphase happens well before the observed calcium wavefront , which coincides with the onset of anaphase ( 5 ) , calcium can not be the signal carrier .",
    "our theoretical analysis suggests that biochemical signaling is unlikely to be consistent with observation ( 3 ) , since the natural tendency of such a model is to produce a wavefront speed that increases with cycle number .",
    "the larger the signaling molecule , the more pronounced this tendency is .",
    "thus , we conclude that scenario a is unlikely .",
    "this prediction could be tested by looking for wavefronts in likely signaling species .",
    "if the wavefront propagates biochemically , then wavefronts should be observable in the appropriate signaling molecules ( presumably cdks or cyclins that are known to govern checkpoints in the cell cycle that precede the onset of metaphase  @xcite ) .",
    "if , as our model suggests , the wavefront does not propagate biochemically , then the original signaling molecule should not exhibit wavefronts .",
    "_ mitosis is triggered by a mechanical signal .",
    "_ in this scenario , there is a mechanical wavefront that triggers mitosis .",
    "the signal is transmitted via stress changes in the embryo and amplified by further release of stress as other nuclei enter the mitotic phase .",
    "because this wavefront propagates mechanically , this speed slows down with successive cycles ( 2 ) .",
    "since we observe a metaphasic wavefront whose speed of propagation slows down with cycle , the metaphasic wavefront itself could be the triggering mechanical wavefront .",
    "it is more likely , however , that the triggering wavefront occurs earlier in the cycle and starts a clock in each nucleus , which controls the mitotic process . as a result of this clock ,",
    "there are many markers of the process that exhibit the same wavefront pattern , including the onsets of metaphase and anaphase ( 1 ) , the release of calcium ( 5 ) , and displacements of the nuclei during metaphase and anaphase ( 3 ) .",
    "this scenario is consistent with all observations .",
    "scenario b is consistent as well with independent observations made in _",
    "xenopus _ embryos .",
    "these embryos are not syncytial ; instead they are divided into cells from the first cycle .",
    "it is unlikely that a biochemical signal could cross cell membranes to propagate a wavefront . nevertheless , these embryos do exhibit metachronous mitosis  @xcite",
    ". they also exhibit calcium oscillations _ inside _ each cell , which precede anaphase  @xcite .",
    "their behavior is therefore most consistent with scenario b : an initial mechanical wavefront triggered by a mechanical process at the onset of metaphase or earlier , is followed by a calcium signal inside each cell and an anaphasic wavefront .",
    "we emphasize that scenario b does not imply that the entire process of triggering mitosis is mechanical . indeed",
    ", the mechanism by which additional stress is generated via a force dipole in our model must be biochemical .",
    "first , there must be some sensor components that are activated when the stress exceeds its threshold value .",
    "these components must then activate other biochemical species to eventually generate additional stress by creating a force dipole",
    ". if scenario b is correct , there should be a way of incorporating our mechanically signaling model into models of the chemical networks that control the cell cycle , such as those of tyson and novak  @xcite .",
    "one question is whether the original triggering mechanical wavefront serves as a checkpoint in the cycle . in order to understand how to include mechanical signaling into such models , it is critical to have new experiments to identify precisely the original triggering wavefront .",
    "our model would predict that signaling molecules in stages of the cell cycle that follow this triggering wavefront should exhibit wavefronts that slow down with cycle , while those in stages that precede the triggering wavefront should not .    in principle , the estimated elastic constants and damping coefficients could be obtained directly from experiments by measuring the storage and loss moduli of the embryo surface _ in vivo _ using two - point microrheology .",
    "optical tweezer experiments similar to the ones done by schtz et al .",
    "@xcite could also be used to extract the elastic moduli and the drag coefficient we used in our mechanical model .",
    "the actin concentration could be measured at the same time by staining the actin filaments with e.g. rhodamine , as done by parry et al .",
    "@xcite or gfp - moesin , as done by cao et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "even though the process of mitosis is known to require chemical activation , the key assumption in scenario b is that the initial wavefront also _ propagates _ mechanically .",
    "this can be tested by mechanically poking the embryo at different times within the cell cycle .",
    "if the cell is poked just in advance of the original triggering wavefront , the poking itself should generate a wave that propagates from the poking site with the same speed as the mitotic wavefront .",
    "if the embryo is poked too far in advance of the original triggering wavefront , however , there should be no response .",
    "if the embryo is poked after the mitotic wavefront begins , there may be no response because the nuclei have already entered mitosis and can no longer be triggered .",
    "thus , we would expect that poking could generate a mitotic wavefront only if it is applied in a certain time window of the cycle that could serve to identify the original triggering wavefront .",
    "note that experiments by farge at a slightly later stage of development in drosophila showed that mechanical stress applied in the appropriate time window can lead dramatic changes in development  @xcite ; scenario b suggests that mechanical stress is important even at the syncytial stages studied here .",
    "finally , we note that biochemical experiments could also test the mechanical - signaling model . the most straightforward test would be to to destroy or degrade the filaments that mechanically couple the nuclei .",
    "this should prevent the mechanical wavefronts from propagating and thus the nuclei from synchronizing their mitosis .",
    "this could be done by injecting colcemid or nocodazole to disrupt the microtubules or latrunculin which affects actin filaments , for example  @xcite .",
    "other means of disrupting cytoskeletal filaments , via mutation or laser ablation , should also affect the mechanical wave .",

    "an example of an experimental image with the chromosomal tracking overlaid is given in figure  [ fig : expdata]a .    because the images were taken at high frequency ( typically 1  hz ) , the nuclei move less than their own radius from one frame to the next , simplifying tracking .",

    "if all of the clocks run at the same rate , there is no wave , but if the clock of each successive person in the line runs more slowly that that of his / her neighbor to the right , then a wavefront will be generated .    for the timing method to be the cause for the wavefronts observed in our system , each nucleus would require a clock .",
    "that clock could simply be the amount of time it takes to duplicate the dna , i.e. , the duration of the interphase , which changes from one cycle to the next .",
    "however , there is no correlation between a nucleus position and the duration of interphase , which means that we would not expect a mitotic wavefront to emerge in this case .",
    "alternatively , it is well - established that there are several proteins which exhibit patterning along the anterior - posterior or dorsal - ventral axes of the embryo .",
    "a much studied example is bicoid , which exhibits an exponential profile along the anterior - posterior axis  @xcite , the same axis along which the wavefront travels . now if the duration of interphase were affected by the local bicoid concentration , that could provide a mechanism for the clocks of the nuclei to get out of sync , and produce a wavefront in the various markers for mitosis ( such as our observed metaphase and anaphase wavefronts ) .",
    "there are three reasons why the model outlined above can not explain our data .",
    "the first is specific to bicoid . as observed by gregor et al .",
    "@xcite , the total amount of bicoid steadily increases over time , as more of the protein is translated in each cycle .",
    "in particular , the amount of protein keeps steady pace with the number of nuclei , such that at the start of each cycle , the actual amount of protein in each nucleus at a given position in the embryo is always the same .",
    "therefore if bicoid were responsible for causing the mitotic wavefronts , the wavefronts would have the same speed in each cycle , which they do not .",
    "the second reason is more general : as we show below , in order to obtain a linear wavefront propagation from an exponential concentration profile , the actual absolute amount of material does not matter , only the decay length - which means that once again the predicted wavefront speed would be independent of cycle .",
    "finally note that to get wavefronts traveling in both directions along the anterior - posterior axis of the embryo , we would need at least two concentration gradients of different proteins , for which it would be highly surprising if they produced wavefronts with the same speed .",
    "the timing method therefore can not describe our data .",
    "we now assume that the nuclei do _ not _ signal each other , in any way , that it is time to start mitosis ; instead , they sample their local environment for a given protein , such as bicoid ( bcd ) , and have the length of their cycle depend on the local concentration . because the concentration of many such proteins does indeed exhibit a gradient from one of the two poles , this could explain how mitosis starts close to the poles , and then seems to ` travel ' along the embryo , where in reality there is no traveling front at all .",
    "roughly speaking , there are four kinds of patterns expressed by proteins in the early _ drosophila _ embryo : an exponential profile along the ap axis starting from one of the poles ( of which bcd is an example  @xcite ) , an exponential profile along the dv axis ( such as dorsal  @xcite ) , a terminal morphogen profile which is high at both poles and both low and flat in between ( as for the phosphorelation gradient of mapk  @xcite ) , and a striped pattern ( for e.g. hunchback , giant , paired and runt  @xcite ) . because the observed mitotic waves start at the poles and then spread along the ap axis of the embryo , the striped patterns and the dv - axis gradients can not be the ones causing them .",
    "there are often _ two _ mitotic waves , which start at the two opposite poles , which suggest that the terminal morphogens might be good candidates , but they hardly show any profile in the mid-60% of the embryo  @xcite .",
    "the most likely candidates are therefore the proteins that have an exponential profile along the ap axis , although in this case there must be at least two proteins that can trigger mitosis .",
    "this latter observation is a first weak point of the timing model , but not necessarily cause to rule it out .    during interphase ,",
    "the nuclei in the syncytial embryo are surrounded by a nuclear membrane ( also known as the nuclear envelope ) .",
    "one of the things the nucleus can do is to concentrate proteins inside that membrane .",
    "this has been observed directly for bcd by gregor et al .",
    "@xcite and confirmed by our own observations .",
    "irrespective of whether the proteins are concentrated in the nuclei during interphase , or they are distributed throughout the entire cytosol , they always exhibit an exponential decay along the anterior - posterior axis .",
    "as observed by gregor et al .",
    "@xcite , the total amount of bcd steadily increases over time , as more of the protein is translated in each cycle . in particular , the amount of protein keeps steady pace with the number of nuclei , such that at the start of each cycle , the actual amount of protein in each nucleus at a given position in the embryo is always the same  @xcite .",
    "let us denote the position along the long axis by  @xmath1 , and the total length of the axis by  @xmath164 .",
    "the local concentration at @xmath1 is then given by @xmath165 , where  @xmath166 is the characteristic length scale of the exponential profile .",
    "as stated above , the experimental results of gregor et al . tell us that @xmath166 is the same in all cycles , whereas @xmath167 goes up  @xcite .",
    "assuming that all nuclei are equally good at collecting material from their environment , the amount of material collected by a single nucleus in a simple one - dimensional model of the embryo is given by @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the number of nuclei .",
    "as stated above , the key assumption of the timing model is that the duration of the cycle of each nucleus depends somehow on the concentration , or rather , on the amount of material in the nucleus , so we have @xmath170    unfortunately , we do not know what the function  @xmath171 in equation  ( [ cycleduration ] ) is .",
    "the only thing we do know is that it is monotonously increasing with its argument ( the total amount of material in a nucleus ) .",
    "we will therefore explore two explicit possibilities :    * the simplest possible dependence : @xmath171 is a linear function . * the dependence that gives the observed behavior of ( effective ) wavefronts , i.e. , that the resulting ` speed '  @xmath26 of mitosis events through the embryo is well - defined and constant throughout , and @xmath172 .",
    "for the first option , we write @xmath173 , with @xmath61 some offset time and @xmath162 a timescale .",
    "we can then calculate the speed of an observed mitotic wavefront , as a function of the number of nuclei  @xmath169 , by calculating the time difference between two positions @xmath1 and @xmath174 in the embryo : @xmath175 equation  ( [ vlinearmodel ] ) shows that @xmath26 depends on the position , so there is no well - defined wavespeed in this model .",
    "this is of course no big surprise - we just took a random functional dependence for @xmath171 , so there should be no reason to expect it would produce a wavespeed that is position - independent .",
    "however , this does illustrate the point that a constant wavespeed is something special : we need to specifically _ choose _ @xmath171 such that a constant speed comes out .",
    "note that it may of course be that there is no constant wavespeed , but that it only appears to be constant within our error bars .",
    "although we can not rule this option out , this also does not come out naturally .",
    "for instance , inserting numbers for _ drosophila _ from gregor et al .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath176 , @xmath177 , @xmath178 ) we find that for @xmath179 , the measured speed more than doubles as we take the measuring point @xmath174 across the embryo , which can certainly not be confused with a constant speed .    to get a constant speed , we need to choose a different function  @xmath171 , specifically a logarithm : @xmath180 . in this case",
    "we find : @xmath181 in this case , we do indeed find a constant value of @xmath26 across the embryo .",
    "however , we also find that @xmath26 is independent of @xmath169 .",
    "@xmath26 does depend on the decay length  @xmath166 , but the value of  @xmath166 does not change  @xcite . the wavefront speed predicted by this model",
    "is therefore the same for all cycles , in direct contradiction to our observations .",
    "the process of diffusion is governed by the diffusion equation , here given for a concentration field  @xmath182 : @xmath183 where @xmath27 is the diffusion constant .",
    "equation  ( [ diffeq ] ) is linear , so we can use the superposition principle : the sum of any two solutions is itself a solution .",
    "the general solution for a system with no boundaries depends only on the initial condition  @xmath184 , and is given by @xmath185 where @xmath186 is the green s function of the diffusion equation , which for a system in @xmath6 dimensions is given by @xmath187 the green s function describes the concentration field at @xmath188 at time @xmath189 due to a single delta - function concentration source at @xmath190 at time @xmath191 .",

    "we pre - arrange the nuclei on a triangular grid , with a little noise in the position of each nucleus to prevent artifacts due to a perfect arrangement .",
    "this is consistent with our observation that just before the mitosis waves the nuclei in an actual embryo have a rather high degree of triangular order , except where there are defects due to the fact that a nucleus did not divide in an earlier cycle .",

    "we thus check all nuclei that have not yet released anything , and determine which one will be the next source by finding the one with the smallest value of @xmath189 , which sets @xmath215 . if there is a nonzero delay time between activation and release , we simply add it to the found value of @xmath215 .",
    "given the positions of the sources , the system thus has three parameters : the diffusion constant  @xmath27 , the release concentration  @xmath23 , and the delay time  @xmath24 .",

    "* stop after either all nuclei have divided or a predefined time has been reached .      in the case without delay time , it is fairly easy to determine the speed of the wavefront for the regime in which the wavefront is well - established , i.e. , when its curvature is small .",
    "suppose the lattice spacing is  @xmath28 , the time it takes to get from one row to the next is  @xmath189 , and the amount of material released by each nucleus is @xmath25 .",

    "our numerical solutions of the full equations show that the data do indeed collapse onto the curve described by equations  ( [ speed1 ] ) and  ( [ fapprox ] ) for different diffusion coefficients and nuclear spacings ( figure  [ fig : ffunctionfit ] ) . in particular , we find that the wavefront speed @xmath26 always _ increases _ as the nuclear spacing  @xmath28 _ decreases _ , so @xmath26 increases with increasing cycle number .       as a function of the dimensionless threshold  @xmath221 in the biochemical signaling model .",
    "the figure shows @xmath235 for several choices of the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( different symbols ) .",
    "the data all collapse on a single curve , as described by equation  ( [ speed1 ] ) .",
    "the dashed line is the fit to that curve of equation  ( [ fapprox ] ) . ]      as indicated in section  [ sec : biochemwavefronts ] , we can include a delay time  @xmath24 into our diffusion model .",
    "now a nucleus divides ( i.e. , releases its chemicals ) a time @xmath24 _ after _ the local concentration first reaches the threshold value  @xmath23 .",
    "to first approximation , the total time between the activation of a nucleus in a given row and one in the next row is simply the sum of the delay time and the travel time , which we found in the previous section .",
    "we therefore find : @xmath236 equation  [ diffmodelspeedwithdelay ] breaks down for long delay times , or small thresholds , as in those cases the effects of earlier releases become important . however , for our system these effects are small .",

    "the only way we can thus fit the experimental data within this model is if either ( or both ) of @xmath23 and @xmath24 change with the cycle number .",

    "we need a change of at least an order of magnitude in each cycle to fit the experimental data . even in the case where we allow both variables to change ,",
