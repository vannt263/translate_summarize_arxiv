    "the photon - counting detectors placed at the output ports of bs2 count the number of photons incident on them after the action of bs2 .",
    "the state at the other output port of bs1 is projected on a specific state among many others according to the number of photons counted at the detectors . in the special case of one - photon detection by one of the detectors and",

    ", the characterization of the optical modes of these lights and their effects on the outcome of the experiments is a major challenge for the quantum - scissors device , too .",

    "in the qsd scheme shown in fig.[fig1 ] , interference of vacuum and single - photon states at bs1 ( 50:50 ) and that of the entangled state of mode 2 mode and the coherent state at bs2 ( 50:50 ) are the fundamental optical processes .",
    "the scheme is usually analyzed in the single mode description in which a pair of annihilation and creation operators for each beam splitter is used . in that picture , the spatio - temporal characteristics of the states input to the beam splitters are assumed to be matched perfectly at the beam splitters and detectors .",
    "however , in practice , these interfering lights are prepared independently and thus may have different modes .",
    "moreover , mode definitions of the states at the output of bs2 and that of the measuring apparatus ( photon counting detectors ) may be different . in these cases , the detection of the correct photon numbers does not mean the correct conditioning ( projection ) of the desired output state . in practical experiments , high level of attention must be given to match the modes of the input states and the detectors as much as possible for a successful state preparation .",
    "a good mode matching shows itself as high visibility and can be a major challenge in experiments .    in this section",
    ", we will introduce the pulse - mode formalism and present general expressions to calculate the overlap of two number states with different modes .",
    "it is assumed that the bandwidth of the light pulses are sufficiently small and the variation of the beam - splitter transmission and reflection parameters within the pulse bandwidths can be neglected . in this case , these parameters become independent of pulse shape and solely reflect    the effect of beam splitters ; beam splitting will not affect the mode structure of the input light pulses .    following refs .",

    "the data related with the filters are given as full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the intensity transmission function ( intensity versus wavelength ) and we measure the fwhm of the intensity spectrum of the light field .",
    "therefore , we have to calculate the mode - match parameter using these experimentally accessible data . applying the narrow - bandwidth limit @xmath261 and @xmath262 , the relation between @xmath263 of the functions in eqs .",
    "( [ n48])-([n51 ] ) and the experimentally accessible bandwidths ( @xmath264 ) with @xmath265 is given as @xmath266 with @xmath267 being the central wavelength of the spectrum .",
    "as a preliminary experiment , for example , we have measured full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) bandwidths as @xmath268 for a pulsed laser with central frequency @xmath269 and @xmath270 after it is frequency doubled . with these values ,",
    "the lower bound for mode match is found as @xmath271,@xmath272 and @xmath273 , respectively , for interference filters of @xmath274 , @xmath275 , and @xmath276 used in the idler channel .",
    "it is clearly seen that narrow - band filtering in the idler channel is crucial for high values of mode overlap . the overlap of the spectrum of the modes can be further increased by using interference filter between bs2 and the photon - counting detectors as in the scheme in @xcite . in that case , the problem reduces to first filtering the signal and the coherent light spectrum with the same narrow - band filter and then calculate their overlap . then for a filter of the form ( [ n49 ] ) with a @xmath245-width of @xmath277 , theoretical upper bound for overlap is calculated as @xmath278where @xmath279 with @xmath280 . in the limiting cases : ( a)@xmath281 , this expression becomes equal to ( [ n52 ] ) , ( b)@xmath282 , the @xmath222 approaches one . using the numerical values given above , if @xmath283 is chosen , @xmath284 is obtained . for @xmath285",

    "when @xmath290 is used , a value of @xmath291 is obtained .",
    "although in the above discussion , we have analyzed only the temporal mode matching , the expressions for the spatial mode matching can be derived using the same procedure .",
    "it must also be noted that using very narrow frequency and spatial filters will result in attenuation of the fields incident on the detectors causing a decrease in the rate of having a correct detection . in a realistic experiment scheme , like the one we have proposed in @xcite",
    ", very good spatial mode matching can be achieved by using single - spatial - mode fibers after bs2 when the output modes are input to the photon - counting detectors @xcite .",

    "a major obstacle for the practical realization of state truncation and preparation using projection synthesis and quantum - scissors device is the mode mismatch of the input lights to the device . in order to study this problem and its effect on the quality of the process",
    "we have developed the pulse - mode projection synthesis , characterize the mode of the interfering lights , and derived the analytical expressions for the output density matrix and fidelity .",
    "the study includes not only the mode mismatch between the interfering lights but that between them and the photodetectors , as well .",
    "povms for the analysis are derived and discussed .",
    "it has been understood that mode mismatch destroys the off - diagonal elements of the output density matrix strongly and in the limiting case of complete mismatch , off - diagonal elements become zero resulting in a classical mixture at the output . when the intensity of the input coherent light is much lower than one , mode mismatch and detector efficiency do not have significant effect on the output of the process .",
    "when the intensity becomes higher , fidelity of the truncation process degrades rapidly with increasing mismatch .",
    "the same behavior is shown to be valid for the preparation of arbitrary superpositions of vacuum and one - photon states .",
    "it has been depicted that the intensity of the input coherent light can always be optimized to maximize the fidelity of the preparation of a desired superposition state .",
    "when desired state has vacuum component dominant , then effect of mismatch is not significant , however when one - photon state becomes dominant fidelity is strongly affected by mismatch . in low mode - mismatch cases , increasing detection efficiency increases the fidelity of truncation , however , when the mode mismatch becomes larger , the effect of detector efficiency on the fidelity of the process decreases .",
