    "the present paper discusses `` discrete surface theory '' .",
    "there are several proposals of discrete surface theory or `` discrete differential geometry '' by several authors from different viewpoints .",
    "for example , one of the big motivations of their studies is to visualize a given smooth surface and compute its geometric quantities , or to consider a series of simplex complex which approximates the surface and discuss convergence theories of the geometric quantities .",
    "this can be taken as a generalization of classical study of geometry of polyhedrons .",
    "another direction is to study discrete integrable systems of the integer networks .",
    "see for example @xcite , for references .",
    "our motivation is to develop a surface theory of embedded graphs .",
    "an embedded graph is a mathematical model of atomic configurations of a matter , where vertices represent atoms , edges interactions or bondings , respectively .",
    "a systematic study of chemical graphs is done by m.  deza and m.  dutour ( see @xcite ) by applying combinatorics .",
    "our approach is a little different .",
    "we would like to define discrete surfaces out of embedded graphs , and their differential geometric notions such as their gauss curvature , and mean curvature , which are believed in materials science to indicate inner frustration and outer stress of the atomic configurations , respectively . for examples ,",
    "a.  l.  mackay and h.  terrones  @xcite proposed a carbon network , which is supposed to be a discrete schwarzian surface ( triply periodic minimal surface , negatively curved in particular ) and caught much attentions in materials science , but there is no precise definitions of curvatures , as far as the authors know .    in the present paper , we define discrete surface as an `` embedded '' 3-valent graph equipped with the normal vector field @xmath0 over its vertices , and the gauss curvature @xmath1 and the mean curvature @xmath2 as the determinant and the trace and of the weingarten map @xmath3 .",
    "we say agraph \" for an abstract graph and a 3-discrete surface \" for an embedded 3-valent graph .",
    "we show their properties in section [ section3 ] corresponding to the classical surface theory , the variational formula of area ( theorem [ thm(variation_formula ) ] ) , and the relation between harmonic maps and minimal surfaces ( theorem [ thm(min_harm ) ] ) . in section [ section(example ) ] , we compute the gauss curvature and the mean curvature of some examples such as plane graphs , sphere - shaped graphs , carbon nanotubes ( hexagonal graphs on a cylinder ) , and the mackay - like crystals ( spatial graphenes ) . we also discuss subdivision of discrete surfaces by using the subdivision theory for abstract 3-valent graphs , which is called the goldberg - coxeter construction , in section [ section(gc ) ] .",
    "the goldberg - coxeter subdivision , which we discussed , keeps to be of 3-valent .",
    "moreover we discuss their convergence to smooth surfaces in section [ sec : subdivision ] .",
    "topological defects of the mackay crystal can be detected by the goldberg - coxeter subdivisions .",
    "we here emphasize that we can not apply the classical study of polyhedrons or simplex complex because there is no natural way to assign faces which bound a given 1-skeltons ( graphs ) and thus no associate complex so that we can apply known notions .",
    "we even treat graphs at each vertex of which graph the vector space spanned by the edges emerge from the vertex is of 2 dimensional ( flat plane ) but the whole graph lies as a surface in the 3-dimensional euclidean space . in that case , the classical definition of curvature defined by its angle defect is zero , but the surface looks like a negatively curved surface . we need a new definition of curvatures to take care of examples including the mackay crystal , arising from materials sciences .",
    "prior to the introduction of a discrete surfaces theory in section [ section3 ] , in this section we briefly review basic facts of the classical surface theory in @xmath4 for the readers .",

    "<S> in the present paper , we propose a new discrete surface theory on 3-valent embedded graphs in the 3-dimensional euclidean space which are not necessarily `` discretization '' or `` approximation '' of smooth surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the gauss curvature and the mean curvature of discrete surfaces are defined which satisfy properties corresponding to the classical surface theory . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the convergence of a family of subdivided discrete surfaces of a given 3-valent discrete surface by using the goldberg - coxeter construction . </S>",
    "<S> although discrete surfaces in general have no corresponding smooth surfaces , we may find one as the limit . </S>"
