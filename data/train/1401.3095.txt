    "as an important subfield in quantum information , quantum simulation  @xcite has attracted increasing interest , and considerable advancements were achieved both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite .",
    "recently , hybrid quantum systems  13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24n,25n have been strongly recommended for quantum simulation because they can combine two distinct advantages of the subsystems : the tunability of artificial atoms such as quantum circuits , and the long coherence times of atoms or spins .",
    "also , strong and tunable coupling between two subsystems can be realized via either direct  19,24,25,26 or indirect  @xcite coupling schemes .    among various hybrid quantum systems ,",
    "the one consisting of superconducting qubits and nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) centers in a diamond  crystal @xcite has become a topic of current interest .",
    "this hybrid quantum system has the merits of high tunability and scalability in superconducting qubits , and long coherence times and stable energy levels in nv centers .",
    "in addition , the magnetic coupling between superconducting qubits and nv centers can be stronger than that between nv centers and a transmission line resonator 28 by three orders of magnitude .",
    "these distinct advantages make this hybrid system a good candidate for simulating the abundant features of many - body systems .",
    "for instance , a hybrid quantum architecture composed of inductively coupled flux qubits , where a nv - center ensemble is placed on top of each qubit loop , was proposed @xcite to simulate a jaynes - cummings ( jc ) lattice . using this hybrid quantum system ,",
    "it is possible to investigate the quantum phase transition between the localized and delocalized phases in a bose - hubbard - like model .",
    "because the flux qubits and the nv centers can be tuned by external magnetic fields , the jc lattice simulated using them is simpler and more tunable than those realized using coupled cavities  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study hybrid quantum systems consisting of spin ensembles and superconducting flux qubits , where each spin ensemble is also realized using the nv centers in a diamond crystal .",
    "different from the hybrid quantum system in ref .",
    "@xcite , a flux qubit is placed in between two nv - center ensembles , and every two nearest - neighbor spin ensembles are effectively coupled via this flux qubit . the coupling strength between flux qubits and spin ensembles",
    "can be tuned to reach the strong- and even ultrastrong - coupling regimes by either engineering the hybrid structure in advance or tuning the excitation frequencies of spin ensembles via the external magnetic fields .",
    "these hybrid quantum systems can be used to simulate the systems of coupled bosons , including the demonstration of bilinear coupling among the bosons . moreover ,",
    "these hybrid systems have the advantage of scalability , so they can be extended to construct hybrid arrays to simulate one - dimensional  ( 1d ) bosonic lattices with tunable coupling strengths . in the strong - coupling regime , the hybrid array is simply reduced to the tight - binding model of a 1d bosonic lattice . in the ultrastrong - coupling regime ,",
    "the hybrid array exhibits more interesting properties .",
    "for instance , because of the bilinear coupling in this regime , it can exhibit quasi - particle excitations that have an energy gap from the ground state .",
    "moreover , it is found that these quasi - particle excitations and the ground state are stable under a certain condition that is tunable via the external magnetic field .",
    "this may provide an experimentally accessible method to probe the instability of the system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we describe the proposed hybrid quantum system consisting of two flux qubits and three adjoining spin ensembles . the effective hamiltonian for the spin ensembles is derived in sec .",
    "iii by adiabatically eliminating the degrees of freedom of the flux qubits in the dispersive regime . in sec .",
    "iv , the proposed hybrid quantum system is extended to a hybrid array , so as to simulate 1d bosonic lattices with tunable coupling strengths .",
    "the behavior of this system in both the strong- and the ultrastrong- coupling regimes is studied .",
    "finally , discussions and conclusions are given in sec .",
    "we start from the simple structure consisting of three spin ensembles , with every two nearest - neighbor ensembles coupled by a flux qubit [ see fig .",
    "fig1(a ) ] .",
    "we use nv centers in a diamond crystal as a spin ensemble 22 .",
    "each flux qubit is realized by a superconducting loop interrupted with three josephson junctions and biased by a static external magnetic field perpendicular to the loop  @xcite .",
    "this superconducting qubit can have a superposition state of clockwise and counterclockwise persistent currents in the loop .",
    "in contrast to the previous proposals  @xcite , where a nv - center ensemble is placed inside the loop of a flux qubit , we place a flux qubit in between two nv - center ensembles in order to achieve effective coupling of the nv - center ensembles and scalable hybrid structures .    for a nv center , the spin-1 triplet sublevels of its electronic ground state with @xmath0 and @xmath1 have a zero - field splitting [ see fig .  [ fig1](b ) ] .",
    "because the strain - induced splitting is negligible compared to the zeeman splitting , the electronic ground state of a single nv center can be described by  @xcite @xmath2where @xmath3 is the zero - field splitting of the electronic ground state , @xmath4 is the usual spin-1 operator , @xmath5 is the g - factor , and @xmath6 is the bohr magneton . for convenience , we set the crystalline axis of the nv center as the @xmath7 direction . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , by introducing a weak external magnetic field @xmath8 along the @xmath7 direction , an additional zeeman splitting between @xmath9 sublevels occurs .",
    "thus , a two - level quantum system with sublevels @xmath10 and @xmath11 can be separated from the other levels . in the subspace of this two - level system",
    ", the hamiltonian of a single nv center can be reduced to ( we set @xmath12 ) @xmath13where @xmath14 is the energy difference between the lowest two sublevels with @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and @xmath15 denote the pauli operators with the two basis states corresponding to the lowest two sublevels .",
    "the subsystem of two flux qubits has a hamiltonian as follows  @xcite @xmath16where the first two terms involve two isolated flux qubits and the third one is the interaction hamiltonian of the two flux qubits coupled via a mutual inductance @xmath17 defined by @xmath18 , with @xmath19 being the persistent current of the @xmath20th flux qubit ; @xmath21 is the energy bias of the @xmath20th flux qubit ( where @xmath22 is the applied static magnetic flux , and @xmath23 the flux quantum ) , @xmath24 is the tunneling energy , and @xmath25 denote the pauli operators of the @xmath20th flux qubit . to reduce the effect of the flux noise , the external static magnetic field of each flux qubit",

    ", we have @xmath79 . when @xmath51 is increased to @xmath80 and @xmath81 to @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "this reaches the strong coupling regime since the coupling strength produced by the flux qubit on its adjoining nv - center ensemble is larger than the decoherence rates of both the flux qubit ( @xmath84 and the nv center ensemble ( @xmath85  @xcite ) .",
    "when @xmath86 is increased to @xmath75 @xmath87  43 , and @xmath81 to @xmath88 , the coupling @xmath64 is strengthened to @xmath89 , which can be comparable to the excitation frequency @xmath90 of the nv - center ensemble because @xmath91 can be tuned small via the external magnetic field .",
    "this corresponds to the ultrastrong coupling regime .",
    "as for the inductive coupling between the nearest - neighbor flux qubits , because they are separated by @xmath92 it is as weak as @xmath93  @xcite .",
    "therefore , compared to the coupling between the flux qubit and its adjoining nv - center ensemble , the inductive coupling can be neglected in the hamiltonian ( [ 8 ] ) .",
    "we rewrite the hamiltonian @xmath94 as @xmath95where the free part @xmath96 is @xmath97and the interaction part @xmath98 is @xmath99we consider the large - detuning case with @xmath100 , where @xmath101 ( @xmath37 @xmath38 ) .",
    "in such a case , the flux qubits can be regarded as being kept in their ground states and only virtual excitations can occur .",
    "therefore , we can use the frhlich - nakajima transformation  @xcite to adiabatically eliminate the degrees of freedom of flux qubits to obtain an effective coupling between the nearest - neighbor spin ensembles .",
    "this unitary transformation @xmath102 requires the anti - hermitian operator @xmath103 to satisfy @xmath104=0.\\]]this gives rise to an effective hamiltonian , up to second order , as @xmath105+o(j^{3}),\\]]where the anti - hermitian operator @xmath106 has the following form : @xmath107with the coefficients given by@xmath108here @xmath109 ( @xmath37 @xmath38)@xmath110    because the coefficients @xmath111 ( @xmath112 to @xmath113 ) are small in the large - detuning case , the higher - order terms of the frhlich - nakajima transformation can be dropped out and only the second - order term @xmath114 $ ] needs to be kept .",
    "moreover , owing to the separate design of the nearest - neighbor flux qubits in our approach , the diagonal term of each flux qubit remains respectively at its original expectation value in the adiabatic approximation , i.e. , @xmath115 with @xmath116 after eliminating the degrees of freedom of each flux qubit , the effective hamiltonian can be obtained as @xmath117where the parameters are given by @xmath118here @xmath119 is the effective excitation frequency of the @xmath20th spin ensemble , and @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) is the effective coupling strength between the first ( second ) and second ( third ) spin ensembles .",
    "therefore , we achieve an effective coupling between the nearest - neighboring spin ensembles , where each spin ensemble behaves like a boson . in eq .",

    "these terms become important in the ultrastrong coupling regime with @xmath126 ( @xmath127 ) .    as a special case",
    ", we further consider the strong coupling regime , i.e. , @xmath128 and @xmath129 . in this case",

    "( [ 18 ] ) . as compared with eq .",

    "this indicates that when the frequency detuning is fixed , the coupling strength @xmath64 between the flux qubits and the spin ensembles should be bounded even in the ultrastrong regime , so as to achieve a stable quantum system .",
    "the dispersion relation for the quasi - particle energy @xmath165 with the given parameters is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where an energy gap separates the quasi - particle excitations from the ground state .",
    "experimentally , one can tune @xmath91 via the external magnetic field @xmath166 on the nv centers in order to satisfy the condition in eq .",
    "( [ 29 ] ) .",

    "( [ 32 ] ) , determines an energy band of the 1d bosonic crystal .",
    "compared with the scheme composed solely of superconducting qubits , our proposed hybrid system can be more easily tuned to the ultrastrong - coupling regime .",
    "experimentally , this can be conveniently achieved by tuning the applied magnetic field to increase the ratio of the coupling strength between the flux qubit and the nv - center ensemble to the excitation frequency of the spin ensemble . as given in sec .",
    "ii , for the experimentally accessible parameters @xmath174 @xmath175 , and @xmath176 , the coupling strength @xmath64 between the flux qubit and the nv - center ensemble can be as strong as @xmath177 .",
    "if the frequency of the nv - center ensemble is tuned , for example , to @xmath178 via the external magnetic field , one can reach an ultrastrong - coupling regime with @xmath179 .",
    "the corresponding ratio of the effective coupling strength @xmath180 between bosons to the excitation frequency of the spin ensemble can reach @xmath181 .",
    "however , in the well - established scheme composed solely of superconducting qubits  @xcite , where two flux qubits are coupled via an additional large - detuned flux qubit , the ratio of the effective coupling strength between the two flux qubits to the single - qubit frequency is about @xmath182 .",
    "obviously , it is much smaller than the achievable ratio @xmath181 in our hybrid system .",
    "coherence times in superconducting qubits have been steadily increasing over the past decade , with the coherence times in excess of @xmath183 @xmath184 for the transmon qubit in a 3d cavity @xcite . due to the large capacitance shunted to the qubit",
    ", the effect of the charge noise on the qubit is greatly suppressed .",
    "also , it is this large shunt capacitance that yields a strong coupling between the qubit and the cavity .",
    "however , it is hard to use only one qubit to both simultaneously and strongly couple two cavities , due to the difficulty in circuits design .",
    "also , it could be a similar case for the proposed 1d array of resonators coupled by either superconducting - ring couplers or dc - squids  @xcite , because it is usually not easy to achieve ultrastrong couplings for a superconducting - ring coupler ( dc - squid ) simultaneously coupled to two resonators .",
    "in contrast , as discussed above , our proposed hybrid system can be more conveniently tuned to the ultrastrong - coupling regime by just tuning the applied magnetic field to increase the ratio of the qubit - spin coupling to the excitation frequency of the spin ensemble .    in a coupled system , it is difficult to directly calculate the relaxation or decoherence times of the subsystems because they depend on the nature of the environment coupled to each subsystem .",
    "however , they can be estimated from some experimental observations .",
    "for instance , in a recent experiment on the hybrid system consisting of a flux qubit and a nv - center ensemble , it was estimated from the observed decay time of the quantum oscillations that , when the flux qubit was in resonance with the nv centers , the relaxation times were @xmath185 @xmath186 for the flux qubit and @xmath187 @xmath184 for the nv centers @xcite . in our proposed hybrid system , the flux qubit is kept in the ground state , so the coherence times of the nv centers should be even longer since the designed off - resonance of the flux qubit to the nv centers will suppress the decoherence on the nv centers induced by the relaxation of the flux qubit .",
    "in fact , in our proposed hybrid system , the flux qubit is largely detuned from the nv centers . typically , the frequency @xmath188 of the flux qubit can be designed as @xmath189-@xmath190 @xmath191 . in the experiments of superconducting qubits , the temperature can be as low as @xmath192 @xmath193 , which corresponds to @xmath194 @xmath195 .",
    "thus , even a lossy flux qubit can indeed be kept in the ground state at such a low temperature , and its relaxation - induced decoherence on the nv centers is then suppressed .    in conclusion , we have studied a hybrid quantum system consisting of spin ensembles and superconducting flux qubits .",
    "each spin ensemble is realized using the nv centers in a diamond crystal , and every two nearest - neighbor spin ensembles are effectively coupled by adiabatically eliminating the degrees of freedom of the flux qubit placed in between these two spin ensembles .",
    "the coupling strengths between flux qubits and spin ensembles can be tuned into strong- and even ultrastrong- coupling regimes by either engineering the hybrid structure in advance or tuning the excitation frequencies of spin ensembles via the external magnetic fields . as an elementary structure",
    ", three effectively coupled spin ensembles can be used to simulate the system of coupled bosons , especially for demonstrating bilinear coupling between bosons in the ultrastrong - coupling regime . moreover , due to the advantage of scalability , this structure can be extended to construct hybrid arrays to simulate 1d bosonic lattices with tunable coupling strengths . in the strong - coupling regime",
    ", the hybrid array can be simply reduced to the tight - binding model on a 1d bosonic lattice . however , in the ultrastrong - coupling regime , the hybrid array exhibits more interesting properties . because of the bilinear coupling in this regime , it can exhibit quasi - particle excitations that have an energy gap from the ground state .",
    "moreover , these quasi - particle excitations and the ground state are stable under a certain condition that is tunable via the external magnetic field .",
