    "the quantum schwinger - like process of black hole pair creation in an external field is by now a well studied subject .",
    "it supplied a way to produce planck scale black holes , and it gave useful clues to the discussion of issues like the statistical properties of black holes , the black hole information paradox , and the analysis of topology changing processes .    in order to turn the pair of virtual black holes",
    "real one needs a background field that provides the energy needed to materialize the pair , and that furnishes the force necessary to accelerate away the black holes once they are created",
    ". this background field can be : ( i ) an external electromagnetic field with its lorentz force ( see @xcite-@xcite ) , ( ii ) the positive cosmological constant @xmath6 , or inflation ( see @xcite-@xcite ) , ( iii ) a cosmic string with its tension ( see @xcite-@xcite ) , ( iv ) a domain wall with its gravitational repulsive energy ( see @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "one can also have a combination of the above fields , for example , a process involving cosmic string breaking in a background magnetic field @xcite , or a scenario in which a cosmic string breaks in a positive cosmological background @xcite .",
    "the evaluation of the black hole pair creation rate has been done at the semiclassical level using the instanton method .",
    "an instanton is an euclidean solution that interpolates between the initial and final states of a classically forbidden transition , and is a saddle point for the euclidean path integral that describes the pair creation rate .",
    "the instantons that mediate the above processes can be obtained by analytically continuing ( i ) the ernst solution @xcite ( which is available only for @xmath7 ) , ( ii ) the de sitter black hole solutions , ( iii ) the c - metric with a generalized cosmological constant @xmath6 @xcite , or ( iv ) the domain wall solution @xcite .",
    "all these exact solutions describe appropriately the evolution of the black hole pair that has been created , since they represent a pair of black holes accelerated by an electromagnetic field , by a cosmological constant , by a string , or by a domain wall , respectively .",
    "an important process that accompanies the production of the black hole pair is the emission of electromagnetic and gravitational radiation . in a flat background , an estimate for the amount of gravitational radiation released during the pair creation period has been given in @xcite .",
    "after the pair creation , the black hole pair accelerates away and , consequently , the black holes continue to release gravitational and electromagnetic energy . in a @xmath7 background ,",
    "the gravitational radiation emitted by uniformly accelerated black holes has been computed in @xcite , while in a ds background this analysis has been carried in @xcite , and in an ads background the programme has been completed in @xcite .",
    "we ask the reader to see , e.g. , the introduction of @xcite for a recent and detailed description of the works done on black hole pair creation processes .    in this paper",
    "we want to analyze the process in which a cosmic string breaks and a pair of black holes is produced at the ends of the string , in an anti - de sitter ( ads ) background ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "therefore , the energy to materialize and accelerate the pair comes from the strings tension . in an ads background this is the only study done in the process of production of a pair of correlated black holes with spherical topology .",
    "the analysis of this process in a flat background ( @xmath7 ) has been done in @xcite , while in a de sitter background ( @xmath8 ) it has been carried in @xcite ) .",
    "the instantons for this process can be constructed by analytically continuing the ads c - metric found in @xcite and analyzed in detail in @xcite .",
    "contrary to the @xmath7 @xcite and @xmath8 @xcite cases , the ads describes a pair of accelerated black holes only when the acceleration supplied by the strings is greater than @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "hence we expect that pair creation of black holes in an ads background is possible only when @xmath9 .",
    "we will confirm this expectation .",
    "the quantum production of uncorrelated ads black holes has been studied in @xcite , and the pair creation process of topological ads black holes ( with hyperbolic topology ) has been analyzed in @xcite in a domain wall background .",

    "[ sec : conc ads ] concluding remarks are presented . in the appendix",
    "[ sec : a1 ] , we discuss , for the benefit of comparison with the @xmath7 case , the pair creation of black holes in a @xmath7 background .",
    "we explicitly compute the numerical value of the pair creation rate , which has not been done yet . in the appendix",
    "[ sec : a2 ] a heuristic derivation of the pair creation rates is given . throughout this paper",

    "the ads c - metric has been found in @xcite . the physical properties and interpretation of this solution",
    "have been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "when @xmath9 , and only in this case @xcite , the ads c - metric describes a pair of uniformly accelerated black holes in an ads background , with the acceleration being provided by two strings , from each one of the black holes towards infinity , that pulls them away .",

    "@xmath20 can have four real zeros which we label in ascending order by @xmath36 .",
    "the roots @xmath28 and @xmath29 are respectively the inner and outer charged black hole horizons , and @xmath26 is an acceleration horizon .",
    "the negative root @xmath37 satisfies @xmath38 and thus has no physical significance .",

    "later on it will be crucial to note that the number and nature of the horizons crossed by an observer that travels into the black hole singularity depends on the angular direction @xmath21 that he is following ( see fig .",
    "[ g3_pc_ads ] ) .",
    "this peculiar feature is due to the lower restriction on the value of @xmath24 ( @xmath50 ) , and a detailed discussion and explanation of it can be found in @xcite ( such an angular dependence occurs also in the flat c - metric @xcite , although not so sharply ) . for example ,",
    "when the observer is travelling towards the black hole singularity following an angular direction in the vicinity of the south pole ( @xmath51 ) , he will cross only the outer @xmath29 and inner @xmath28 black hole horizons ( see fig . [ g3_pc_ads ] ) , while when he does this trip following an angular direction in the vicinity of the equator ( @xmath52 ) , he crosses the acceleration horizon @xmath26 before passing through the black hole horizons @xmath29 and @xmath28 .    in order to evaluate the black hole pair creation rate we need to find the instantons of the theory , i.e.",
    ", we must look into the euclidean section of the ads c - metric and choose those euclidean solutions which are regular in a way that will be explained soon .",
    "the euclidean section of the ads c - metric is obtained from the lorentzian ads c - metric by introducing an imaginary time coordinate @xmath53 in ( [ c - metric])-([f - el ] ) . to have a positive definite euclidean metric we must require that @xmath24 belongs to @xmath54 .",
    "in general , when @xmath55 , one then has conical singularities at the horizons @xmath56 and @xmath57 . in order to obtain a regular solution we have to eliminate the conical singularities at both horizons , ensuring in this way that the system is in thermal equilibrium .",
    "this is achieved by imposing that the period of @xmath58 is the same for the two horizons , and is equivalent to requiring that the hawking temperature of the two horizons be equal . to eliminate the conical singularity at @xmath56 the period of @xmath58",
    "must be @xmath59 ( where @xmath60 is the surface gravity of the acceleration horizon ) , @xmath61 this choice for the period of @xmath58 also eliminates simultaneously the conical singularity at the outer black hole horizon , @xmath29 , if and only if the parameters of the solution are such that the surface gravities of the black hole and acceleration horizons are equal ( @xmath62 ) , i.e. @xmath63 this condition is satisfied by a regular euclidean solution with @xmath64 that will be referred to as nonextreme ads instanton .",
    "we now turn our attention to the case @xmath65 ( and @xmath66 ) .",
    "when this happens the allowed range of @xmath24 in the euclidean sector is simply @xmath67 .",
    "this occurs because when @xmath68 the proper distance along spatial directions between @xmath26 and @xmath29 goes to infinity .",
    "the point @xmath29 disappears from the @xmath69 section which is no longer compact but becomes topologically @xmath70 .",
    "thus , in this case we have a conical singularity only at @xmath26 , and so we obtain a regular euclidean solution by simply requiring that the period of @xmath58 be equal to ( [ period tau - ya ] ) .",
    "we will label this solution by extreme ads instanton .    in a de sitter ( ds )",
    "background there is another @xmath55 instanton which satisfies @xmath71 .",
    "it is called nariai instanton . moreover , in the ds background , there is also a special solution that satisfies @xmath72 .",
    "it is called ultracold instanton . in the ads",

    "these instantons are the natural ads c - metric counterparts of the lukewarm ds c and cold ds c instantons constructed in @xcite .",
    "thus , these instantons could also be labelled as lukewarm ads c and cold ads c instantons .",

    "<S> we analyze the quantum process in which a cosmic string breaks in an anti - de sitter ( ads ) background , and a pair of charged or neutral black holes is produced at the ends of the strings . the energy to materialize and accelerate the pair comes from the strings tension . in an ads background </S>",
    "<S> this is the only study done in the process of production of a pair of correlated black holes with spherical topology . </S>",
    "<S> the acceleration @xmath0 of the produced black holes is necessarily greater than @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the cosmological constant . only in this case </S>",
    "<S> the virtual pair of black holes can overcome the attractive background ads potential well and become real . </S>",
    "<S> the instantons that describe this process are constructed through the analytical continuation of the ads c - metric . </S>",
    "<S> then , we explicitly compute the pair creation rate of the process , and we verify that ( as occurs with pair creation in other backgrounds ) the pair production of nonextreme black holes is enhanced relative to the pair creation of extreme black holes by a factor of @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the black hole horizon area . </S>",
    "<S> we also conclude that the general behavior of the pair creation rate with the mass and acceleration of the black holes is similar in the ads , flat and de sitter cases , and our ads results reduce to the ones of the flat case when @xmath5 . </S>"
