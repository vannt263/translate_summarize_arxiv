    "the hungarian - made automated telescope network ( hatnet ) is an ongoing project to detect transiting extra - solar planets using small aperture ( 11 cm diameter ) , robotic telescopes ( bakos et al .",
    "2004 , hereafter b04 ) .",
    "the hatnet telescopes make use of a fast focal ratio ( f/1.8 ) to efficiently monitor a large number of fairly bright stars ( @xmath6 ) over a wide field - of - view ( fov ) .",
    "a number of other groups have also taken this small - telescope approach toward finding transits ( see horne  2003 for a comprehensive list ) .",
    "in contrast , there are several groups that employ a `` narrow , but deep '' method .",
    "this includes the transit search by the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) project , which to date has discovered three confirmed `` very hot jupiters '' ( udalski et al .  2002 , 2003 ;",
    "konacki et al .",
    "2003 ; torres et al .  2004 ; bouchy et al .  2004",
    "; konacki et al .",
    "2004 ) , the only planets detected so far by transit searches .",
    "besides the size of the telescopes and fov , another difference between the approaches is the method used to obtain photometry for the monitored stars . for several years",
    "many of the `` narrow and deep '' searches have made use of the image subtraction techniques due to alard & lupton  ( 1998 ; also alard  2000 ) .",
    "this includes ogle which uses difference image analysis ( dia , wozniak  2000 ) , and pisces ( mochejska et al .  2002 , 2004 ) which uses a different implementation of image subtraction in monitoring the open clusters ngc  2158 & ngc  6791 .",
    "image subtraction is the current state of the art for massive time - series photometry .",
    "it has been shown that in narrow , dense fields , it can produce light curves with precision down to the photon limit ( e.g.  see mochejska et al .",
    "however , to date there exists no published results that use image subtraction in a wide - field setting .",
    "this has limited these searches to observing only relatively isolated stars in regions where point spread function ( psf ) fitting and aperture photometry yield high precision .",
    "in this paper we report our use of image subtraction to obtain light curves for 98,000 objects in a single field , near the galactic plane , observed with one of the hatnet telescopes ( hat-5 ) .",
    "this field was chosen in particular because of its overlap with nasa s _ kepler _ mission to observe transiting planets from space ( borucki et al.2003 ) . over 9,000 of the brightest light curves",
    "have a root - mean - square ( rms ) of less than 1% ( i.e. better than 10 millimagnitude precision ) at 5-min sampling . in the following section we describe our observations , and in  3 we discuss our image subtraction based data reduction to obtain the light curves .    while the main purpose of hatnet remains the discovery of transiting extra - solar planets , it is also useful for discovering and characterizing variable stars in the galaxy . to this end",
    "we have analyzed these light curves to select a list of 1617 variable stars , of which 1439 are newly discovered .",
    "we describe our selection criteria in  4 and present our catalog , including a discussion of many interesting cases , in  5 .",
    "we finish with a brief summary of our results in  6 .",
    "the data were obtained in june and july , 2003 using the hat-5 telescope located at the fred lawrence whipple observatory ( flwo ) .",
    "the telescope uses a canon 11  cm diameter f/1.8l lens and a cousins i - band filter to image onto an apogee ap10 front - illuminated , 2k@xmath72k ccd .",
    "the result is an @xmath8  fov image with a pixel scale of @xmath9 . for details on the design and performance of the instrument",
    "the pointing was stepped in a prescribed pattern of sub - pixel increments during each exposure to broaden the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the stellar profiles from @xmath10  pix to @xmath11  pix .",
    "the field we observed ( hat-199 ) is centered at @xmath12 ( j2000.0 ) and lies at the western boundary of the constellation cygnus ( fig .",
    "[ fov ] ) .",
    "the south - eastern ( lower left ) corner of the field is within @xmath13 of the galactic plane .",
    "as mentioned above , this field was chosen to overlap with the proposed center for nasa s _ kepler _ mission ( d.  latham , private communication ) .",
    "thus these observations may be useful as a means of identifying interesting objects ( including stars bearing transiting planets ) to be investigated at higher precision with _",
    "kepler_.    this field contains hundreds of thousands of relatively bright sources , from which we select 98,000 with @xmath14 just from the sources we select the density is 0.4 objects per square - arcmin . at our pixel scale",
    "this corresponds to one object per 42 pixels , or a typical separation of 6 - 7 pixels between the objects . at this density the stellar profiles",
    "are highly blended , particularly toward the galactic plane ( fig .",
    "[ refimage ] ) .",
    "because of this severe blending , large portions of this field would not be useful for transit searches or precision photometry in general using traditional photometric methods ( e.g. simple aperture photometry , or psf fitting ) .",
    "the preliminary ccd reductions including dark current subtraction , flat - fielding , etc .  were discussed in b04 .    to obtain photometry we used the image subtraction methods due to alard & lupton  ( 1998 , also alard 2000 ) .",
    "we describe the procedure here , referring the reader interested in the theoretical basis of the method to the original papers .    the simplest method to measure",
    "the apparent magnitude of a star is to measure the total signal within a fixed aperture centered on the star using a constant weight per pixel .",
    "however , when one is working on a crowded stellar field this method breaks down since more than one source will contribute light to the aperture .",
    "the typical procedure in this case is to determine a psf for the frame using bright / isolated stars , and then fit that psf to all the stars on the frame .",
    "when obtaining light curves for the stars in a dense field , it is useful to note that on average the intrinsic magnitude of the stars does not change from image to image . instead of performing psf fitting separately on every image , one can obtain higher precision by performing weighted aperture photometry on the sparsely populated difference image formed by subtracting the image from a reference image . to do",
    "this one needs a method for matching two images with different psfs before subtracting so that the subtracted image is not dominated by residuals from the different psfs .",
    "alard & lupton ( 1998 ) solved this problem by proposing an efficient method for finding a function that transforms the psf of the reference image into the psf of the image to be subtracted ( the kernel ) .",
    "their scheme does not assume anything about the shape of the psf , only that the kernel , which relates the psfs on different images , can be written in terms of a product of gaussians and polynomials ( of arbitrary order ) .",
    "alard ( 2000 ) modified the procedure to allow for spatial variations in the kernel which can be fit with a polynomial . when fitting the kernel it is not necessary to use only bright / isolated stars , instead even stars in the highest density regions contribute to the fit .",
    "this is one reason why the kernel can be obtained with better accuracy than an independent determination of the psf .",
    "another reason why the kernel can be determined with better accuracy than the psf is that while the psf can have an arbitrary shape that may not be well - fit by any model function , empirically the kernel relating two psfs from the same instrument appears to be well - fit by alard & lupton s model , regardless of the shape of the psf . moreover , because the method allows for a constant scaling of the kernel , any correlated variations such as the change in magnitude due to different atmospheric extinction are automatically removed .    once the kernel is obtained and the images have been subtracted , it is a simple step to obtain the relative change in magnitude between the subtracted image and the reference image .",
    "this is done by determining a psf for the reference image , convolving it with the kernel , and then performing weighted aperture photometry on the subtracted image .",
    "since the kernel can be obtained with better accuracy than the psf , by determining a single psf and applying it to all the images ( after transforming with the kernel ) one can achieve higher precision light curves than by determining the psf of each image separately .",
    "note that this procedure only works in the regime where the psf can be accurately determined on the reference image . in the limit of an extremely crowded field",
    ", one may have to obtain the psf directly on the subtracted image .",
    "all of the above procedures are included in the isis 2.1 package .",
    "there are several references on how to run isis , the procedure we follow is similar to that used by mochejska et al .",
    "we discuss the specifics of our implementation in appendix a.      there are two approaches that one can take toward obtaining light curves and identifying variables with subtracted images .",
    "the first is to co - add the absolute value of the subtracted images and search for strong point source signals to identify variable stars for which to obtain light curves .",
    "the second is to generate a list of stars from the reference image , measure photometry on the subtracted images for a selection of stars on the list , and scan the resulting light curves for variables .",
    "using the former approach it becomes very difficult to efficiently identify extremely subtle variations , such as those due to a transiting planet , as these tend to get washed out in the overall noise of the image ( mochejska et al .",
    "2002 ) . since the transit candidates are typically amongst the sources with the smoothest light curves , it is more efficient to obtain photometry for all the objects and use routines that are optimized for selecting candidates directly from the light curves .",
    "for this reason we implement the latter approach . in doing",
    "so we do make two sacrifices : any transient phenomena which do not have a signal in the 47 images combined to make the reference image go unnoticed , and constant stars located near variable stars will have variable light curves as a result of the non - deblending , weighted aperture photometry performed on the subtracted images by the isis routine `` phot.csh . ''",
    "the second problem turns out to be significant for our program , and we describe the steps we have taken to mitigate it in  4.6 .",
    "note that this procedure also requires the ability to generate an input list of stars .",
    "since image subtraction is often able to perform even in the densest fields , when working in an extremely crowded field the former approach may be the only option for identifying variables    to obtain the list of stars we used the daophot / allstar package ( stetson 1987 , 1992 ) .",
    "the list contains 98,000 objects ranging in magnitude from @xmath15=7.79 down to 14.87 .",
    "we then obtained light curves for all 98,000 objects using the `` phot.csh '' routine contained in the isis package .",
    "we discuss the details of this procedure in appendix b.    we used the _ hipparcos _ main catalogue ( perryman et al .",
    "1997 ) to provide the absolute calibration for our instrumental , i - band , reference magnitudes .",
    "using the coordinates we obtained from matching to the two micron all sky survey ( _ 2mass _ ; skrutskie et al.1997 ) as discussed in  3.4 , we obtained matches with 55 point sources from _ hipparcos _ that also had i - band measurements listed .",
    "the i magnitudes listed were all obtained from ground - based measurements , or from transformations of _ hipparcos _ measurements in other photometric systems .",
    "we find a 1-@xmath16 uncertainty of @xmath17 magnitudes on our absolute calibration to _",
    "this error is likely on the _ hipparcos _ side and may be due to the variety of sources for the i - band measurements .",
    "figure [ sig ] shows the light curve rms vs.  reference magnitude for our 98,000 objects . because many of the light curves contain outliers that result from non - random errors ( e.g.  satellite crossings , bad pixels , etc . ) , before calculating the rms of fig  [ sig]-a we first sorted each light curve by magnitude and removed two outlier points from each end . from this plot",
    "it is clear that we have obtained a photometric precision down to 3.5 millimagnitudes at the bright end . for the dim end",
    "the noise is dominated by the background and rises to 0.01 magnitudes at i@xmath111.3 .",
    "this is very close to the results that have been achieved on sparse stellar fields using aperture photometry with the same instrument ( see b04 ) .",
    "from this we conclude that we can achieve the same precision in a dense field with image subtraction that we can in a sparse field with aperture photometry .",
    "the fact that neither method is good down to the photon limit implies that there is some as yet unexplained systematic error that affects both methods .",
    "there are a total of 9,004 light curves with rms better than 10 millimagnitudes , and another 16,540 light curves with rms between 10 and 20 millimagnitudes .",
    "although we achieve very high precision for the brightest stars , it is apparent that we are not photon - limited at the bright end . to determine whether or not our systematic errors are correlated along the light curves , we binned the light curves in time using a bin size of 20 minutes .",
    "this reduced the maximum number of points per light curve from 784 to 286 , a factor of 2.7 .",
    "if the errors were correlated on time - scales longer than 20 minutes , this procedure would not affect the rms of the light curves .",
    "but for uncorrelated errors we would expect the rms to be reduced by 40% . in fig",
    "[ sig]-b we show the resulting sigma vs.  reference @xmath15 diagram , together with a line tracing the bottom envelope from fig  [ sig]-a . at the bright end the rms approaches 2.5 mmag , or a reduction of 29% , which is consistent with the errors being uncorrelated .      because the isis package provides an image registration routine via `` interp.csh ''",
    ", we do not follow the same steps as b04 to match images to one another . instead ,",
    "once we have the x , y positions of all point sources in our field from daophot , we use the delaunay - triangulation algorithm as described in b04 to match to the guide star catalog 2.2 ( bucciarelli et al .",
    "2001 ) . using the resulting ra / dec grid for our field ,",
    "we match our entire list to _",
    "2mass _ using a matching radius of @xmath18 .",
    "we then adopt ra / dec from _ 2mass _ for the matched sources .    because _ 2mass",
    "_ contains many objects that are much fainter than our upper magnitude limit , and is at higher resolution than our observations , we only match to _ 2mass _ sources with @xmath19 . even at this cut",
    "there are over 170,000 _ 2mass _ sources in the field compared to our 98,000 . taking a cut at fainter magnitude will tend to increase the number of spurious matches between our objects and fainter _ 2mass _ sources .",
    "although the magnitude that we measure for each `` object '' will be the summed @xmath15-band of all objects within roughly @xmath20 , for the purposes of follow - up we will adopt the convention that our `` object '' lies at the location of the nearest _ 2mass _ source within @xmath18 that has @xmath19 .    using a @xmath18 matching radius",
    "we obtain 83,900 matches , with 6,174 objects having more than one _ 2mass _ source within @xmath18 ( multiple matches ) . for all multiple matches",
    ", we choose the closest match as the `` real '' one .",
    "we also matched with smaller radii : for @xmath21 there were 16,557 matches , and for @xmath22 there were 64,844 matches . to determine whether or not the number of multiple matches is consistent with random matching , we also shifted our entire starlist by @xmath23 and by @xmath20 and matched it to _",
    "2mass_. for the @xmath23 shift we obtained 6776 matches , and for the @xmath20 shift we obtained 4103 matches .",
    "if the 170,000 _ 2mass _ objects were randomly distributed across the frame , one would expect to find 1 object for every 24 pixels .",
    "assuming that our 98,000 objects are also randomly distributed we would expect 6,400 random matches between hat and _",
    "2mass_. this is consistent with the number of multiple matches that we see with the @xmath18 matching radius , and with the number of matches that we see with the @xmath23 shift .",
    "the fact that the number of matches drops as we shift to @xmath20 may suggest that the objects are not randomly distributed but have some degree of clustering .",
    "there are a number of objects with @xmath24 that will not have matches in our catalog . using the distribution of colors @xmath25",
    "obtained from the _ 2mass _ matches with @xmath26 we estimate that roughly 5000 of the observed sources with @xmath27 should have @xmath24 . the fact that 13,920 of the 14,100 unmatched objects have @xmath27 shows that most of the unmatched objects ( @xmath19000 ) can not be accounted for from the _ 2mass _ cutoff .",
    "these sources may be spurious detections by daophot , or they could be sources with bad astrometry . if we assume that they are spurious then we can estimate that for @xmath28 approximately 10% of the sources are spurious , for @xmath29 approximately 20% are spurious , and for @xmath30 more than 30% are spurious .    with a pixel radius of @xmath31",
    "we would expect to achieve better than @xmath21 precision in our astrometry .",
    "the fact that we require a @xmath18 matching radius is somewhat surprising . indeed in performing the magnitude zero - point calibration 90% of the matches to hipparcos",
    "were better than @xmath21 .",
    "the hipparcos stars were bright ( @xmath32 ) , and we find that for our match to _",
    "2mass _ we match to better than @xmath21 for most of the bright stars .",
    "it seems likely that there is a systematic error that affects the astrometry at the faint end .",
    "before proceeding with the selection of variables , it is useful to rescale the formal flux errors from isis to match the empirically observed errors . this is necessary since the formal errors are assumed to represent the real errors when used by variability tests such as stetson s `` j '' ( stetson 1996 ) .",
    "we follow a procedure similar to that used by kaluzny et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .    to do this",
    "we calculate the reduced chi - square    @xmath33    for every light curve and plot it as a function of i ( fig .",
    "[ chisqrvi ] ) . here",
    "@xmath34 is the measured magnitude at time @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the mean magnitude for the light curve , and @xmath37 is the formal error assigned to the magnitude measurement . the observed @xmath38 rises well above the expected value of 1 at the bright end .",
    "this is because systematic errors dominate the light curves of the bright stars as described in  3.3 . to account for these systematics in our errors",
    "we fit a curve to the `` ridge '' of the observed @xmath38 vs.  @xmath15 distribution .",
    "we then multiply the formal errors by the square - root of this function .",
    "the resulting `` corrected '' @xmath38 vs.  @xmath15 is shown in fig .",
    "[ chisqrvi]-b .      as a preliminary selection of variable stars ,",
    "we apply the stetson `` j '' variability test ( stetson 1996 ) . to apply this statistic one forms @xmath39",
    "pairs of observations each with a weight @xmath40 and then calculates @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the product of the normalized magnitude residuals , @xmath43 of the two paired observations .",
    "the pairing and weighting scheme that we use is analogous to the one employed by kaluzny et al .",
    "we use a time - scale of 30 minutes for pairing , assigning a weight of 1.0 to pairs formed by distinct points , and a weight of 0.1 to `` pairs '' formed from a single point .    to select the variable stars we apply a cut of @xmath44 ( fig .",
    "[ jstetson ] ) .",
    "this selects 2830 light curves , all of which show some form of correlated variability .",
    "the majority of light curves selected with the above procedure do not show any periodicity within the 30 day window of observations . typically these light curves increase or decrease monotonically over the run , although there are some that achieve a minimum or maximum magnitude . for the purposes of this paper we define a `` long period variable '' ( lpv ) to be any variable for which the fit to a parabola is substantially better than the fit to the mean .",
    "these are most likely mira variables or semi - regular / irregular variables .    to separate the lpvs from the other variable stars we apply the following simple cut .",
    "we first fit a parabola to all the light curves flagged as variable by the @xmath45 cut .",
    "we then calculate the reduced chi - squared , @xmath38 ( we use the short - hand @xmath46 , e.g. @xmath47 in the case of fitting to a parabola ) , for each fit .",
    "true lpvs will show dramatic improvement when fit with a parabola as opposed to fitting with the mean ( @xmath48 ) . to select the lpvs we perform an f - test , classifying any light curve with @xmath49 as an lpv ( fig .",
    "[ lpvchisqr ] ) .",
    "this procedure selects 1535 candidate lpvs , leaving 1295 candidate non - lpv variables .",
    "we chose this cut empirically at a point where light curves that may be best fit with a 3rd order polynomial begin to be mixed in with the parabolic light curves .",
    "an example of how a light curve with @xmath50 compares to a light curve with @xmath51 is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ lpvchisqr ] .",
    "in  3.3 we claimed that our systematic errors are uncorrelated on time - scales longer than 20 minutes .",
    "although this is true for the majority of stars , we do see a number of light curves that show nearly identical variations .",
    "these trends can be classified into three basic types : template1-like ( fig  [ trends]-a ) , template2-like ( fig  [ trends]-b ) , and template3-like ( fig  [ trends]-c ) . since image subtraction assumes conservation of flux , there are a number of light curves that show the same trends , but reflected about the horizontal axis .",
    "regardless of the nature of these systematic variations , we believe the most straightforward way to reject light curves that show these trends is to reject those that have a substantially smaller chi - squared when fit , point - by - point , to the template light curves , than when fit to the mean . when fitting to the templates we allow one free parameter : an overall scaling of the variations above and below the mean .",
    "we apply different cuts for the lpv and non - lpv light curves , since a very strict cut tends to reject more lpvs than non - lpvs , particularly for fitting to template1 . for template3",
    "we also imposed a magnitude cut to avoid removing variables that had a numerically good fit , but had a maximum at a different time and were thus probably not spurious .",
    "looking back through the permitted lpvs we rejected 4 candidates by eye that showed a strong resemblance to template3 or template2 .",
    "the template3 cut was applied after all other cleaning steps .",
    "we also observed a number of light curves that appeared to be correlated with the airmass of the observations .",
    "these tended to be removed more efficiently by fitting to template1 or template2 than by defining a separate template , as a number of `` true '' variables showed small 1 day oscillations on top of an over - all `` real '' variation , and would be rejected by a separate template .",
    "as a check on our template3 rejections we examined the light curves released by the northern sky variability survey ( nsvs , wozniak et al.2004 ) for the 13 objects rejected by template3 .",
    "the survey made use of the robotic optical transient search experiment ( rotse - i ) to provide to the public a temporal record of the northern sky over the optical magnitude range from 8 to 15.5 .",
    "notably the optics and ccd used for this telescope are now in use on the hat-5 instrument .",
    "the majority of our template3-like light curves have a full - amplitude of @xmath52 mag , however as they are classified as lpvs , one might expect that if they are real then a number of them should have full - amplitudes greater then @xmath53 mag when observed over a longer baseline .",
    "the typical rms for the nsvs light curves of these objects is @xmath54 mag , so any variations with full - amplitude less than @xmath53 mag would be unrecognizable in these light curves .",
    "we find that 3 of the template3-like light curves appear to show variations in the nsvs .",
    "these 3 , including hat199 - 648 , hat199 - 3997 and hat199 - 4205 will remain in our catalog .",
    "it should be noted that all three of these light curves show an inverted template3-like shape , and that 3 of them have full - amplitudes greater than 0.1 magnitudes in our observations , and are therefore already suspect as template3-like .    for the variables classified as lpvs",
    "we reject 9 light curves with @xmath55 , 10 light curves with both @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and an additional 4 by eye . for non - lpvs",
    "we reject 359 light curves with @xmath58 and another 99 light curves with @xmath59 .    as a further cleaning step we also rejected 46 of the non - lpv light curves that had fewer than 693 points .",
    "we did not reject 2 light curves that had fewer than 693 points but appeared to show real variability .      to search the remaining 791 candidate non - lpv variable stars for periodicity",
    ", we use a variation of the period finding algorithm by schwarzenberg - czerny ( 1996 ) .",
    "this algorithm is implemented in a code due to j.  devor ( private communication ) .",
    "the codes provides the two `` optimal '' periods , along with a measure of confidence for these periods ( @xmath60 ) .    using the best period as a starting point",
    ", we proceeded to classify the remaining 791 non - lpv light curves by hand as either periodic ( with period less than 14 days ) , miscellaneous ( a light curve that is not an lpv , and does not have a period @xmath61 14 days ) or a light curve to reject ( typically light curves that appeared to be dominated by periods that were harmonics of one day , or light curves that resembled the trends of  4.4 ) .",
    "we chose a 14 day cut - off for the period to ensure that any light curve we classified as periodic completed more than 2 full periods within the window of observations . since rejecting light curves by eye is a highly subjective procedure we decided to find objective cuts that would generally yield the same subjective classifications .",
    "we rejected light curves whose best period fell near a harmonic of one day and had a low value of @xmath60 , or light curves with a best period greater than 8 days and @xmath62 .",
    "for the remaining light curves we called the object `` periodic '' if the best period was less than 14 days , and `` miscellaneous '' if not .",
    "these particular cuts were chosen empirically as providing the cleanest removal of `` suspicious '' light curves .",
    "the results of these cuts are shown in figure [ psig ] .",
    "we looked through the rejected light curves and rescued 8 cases that we believed were clearly variables .",
    "we also looked through the periodic and miscellaneous light curves , rejecting 5 light curves that showed a significant resemblance to one of the templates (  4.4 ) .",
    "there were 294 light curves rejected in this step .",
    "we erred on the side of caution for the rejection cuts , a look through the rejected light curves reveals many other probable `` true '' variables .",
    "for this reason we do not claim completeness for our periodic or miscellaneous class variables .",
    "following the above classification / cleaning procedures , and prior to the removal of the template3-like light curves , we were left with 3 sets of variable stars : 1526 lpvs , 266 miscellaneous variables , and 231 periodic variables .",
    "however , as mentioned in  3.2 , one short - coming of the isis photometry program `` phot.csh '' is that it does not account for blending in the subtracted images .",
    "although true variables are generally well separated in the subtracted images , any given variable may have a number of non - variable stars within a rad_aper . as a result",
    ", `` phot.csh '' will sample a portion of the variable flux from the nearby variable star when measuring the magnitude of the non - variable star , and our procedure may flag some of these stars as variables .",
    "existing routines , such as daophot , that perform `` de - blending '' profile photometry do not allow for negative fluxes , and as such will not work on subtracted images .",
    "moreover , running these routines on the absolute value of the subtracted images will have difficulty dealing with the case of two nearby variables , with one a positive variation and the other a negative variation . since `` phot.csh '' weights each pixel in the aperture by the psf , `` phot.csh '' will measure less flux for the non - variable stars than for the true variables , as the non - variables will be off - center from the variable flux .",
    "this suggests a method to separate the true variables from the blended light curves .    the first step is to identify blending groups . from each blending group",
    "we identify the true variable as the light curve that has the highest standard deviation ( in flux ) . to select the blending groups we first find all pairs of variable stars that are separated by fewer than 6 pixels .",
    "there are a total of 461 pairs ( well above the expected number due to random matching ) involving 695 distinct light curves .",
    "we then form groups so that pairs like 1 - 2 and 2 - 3 will be grouped into 1 - 2 - 3 etc .",
    "the largest groups contained 5 light curves ( there were 3 of these groups ) .",
    "this formed 305 groups so that 390 objects were rejected as blended light curves .",
    "two of the remaining periodic variables were then removed by hand as they showed no obvious periodicity , and a strong likeness to template1 .    following the correction for blending ( and removal of template3-like lpvs as per  4.4 ) we arrived at our final list of variables consisting of 1169 lpvs , 241 miscellaneous variables and 207 periodic variables for a total of 1617 distinct variables .",
    "the periodic variables were then classified , by hand , into two general classes : eclipsing variables ( 157 objects ) and pulsating variables ( 50 objects ) .",
    "these further classifications are subjective and represent the authors suspicions as to whether or not the light curve appears to show some form of eclipses .    because we only choose one true variable from each blending group we will reject true variables that lie within 6 pixels of other , larger amplitude ( in flux ) , true variables .",
    "when two true variables are nearby one another , the light curves of both objects will likely show variability blending .",
    "our procedure will reject the true variable whose flux light curve has a smaller standard deviation .",
    "however , the light curve of the accepted variable will likely show some variations due to the rejected variable . for 1617 variables randomly distributed across the image ,",
    "we expect @xmath1 70 such pairings , or roughly 4% of all cases . since we are more inclined toward correctly identifying variables than forming a complete list ( that will include many false - positives ) we choose to live with the rejections",
    ". it should be noted , however , that as many as 4% of our variable star light curves may show contamination from another nearby variable star which is not included in the list",
    ". this number may be even higher if there is clustering as suggested in  3.4 .",
    "as an example of this variability blending consider figure  [ lcblend ] . figure  [ lcblend]-a shows the light curve of an object that we matched with v484 cyg , an ea / sd binary with eclipses of 1 mag in v ( between 13.5 and 14.5 ) and a period of 1.29 days , as well as to v1360 cyg , a known mira variable .",
    "our observations reveal a monotonic decrease in flux from @xmath63 to @xmath64 over 30 days , with slight eclipses .",
    "a search of nearby objects revealed a star within 2 pixels with a light curve that showed deeper eclipses on top of an overall declining envelope ( fig  [ lcblend]-b ) .",
    "indeed both these objects are matched to separate _",
    "2mass _ objects .",
    "this , we believe , is an especially pronounced case of variability blending where two real variables lie within each others aperture and hence the variability is blended into both objects . in this case",
    "fig  [ lcblend]-b likely corresponds to v484 cyg , and fig  [ lcblend]-a to v1360 cyg .",
    "our selection method retained v1360 cyg while rejecting v484 cyg as a blended light curve .",
    "because the light curve of v484 cyg is strongly corrupted by the presence of the nearby lpv , we will not attempt to `` rescue '' it into the catalog , and will only include v1360 cyg .",
    "it is important to stress that in this procedure we do not , in any way , correct for the blending that results from resolution limits whereby a number of distinct sources are blended into an individual object .",
    "indeed many of the individual light curves may consist of the summed light from several sources lying along the same line of sight .",
    "instead , the blending that we correct for is the blending of variability into multiple resolved objects that results from `` phot.csh '' applying simple weighted - aperture photometry on the subtracted images .",
    "the full catalog of variable stars , including _",
    "2mass _ coordinates and ids where available , will be available with the electronic version of the refereed paper .",
    "the catalog and light curves are also available on the world - wide - web . for illustration",
    "we display the first 9 rows of the catalog in table  [ tab1 ] and table  [ tab2 ] . in the table",
    "we provide the hat - id for each object , which uses the form hat199- ? ? ? ? ?",
    ", where the number is between 00001 and 98000 and sorts the light curves by reference magnitude . in this section",
    "we discuss the overall properties of the various classes of variables , as well as some of the interesting cases from each class .",
    "to cross - check with known sources , we matched our list of variables to the combined general catalog of variable stars ( _ gcvs _ , kholopov et al .",
    "the _ gcvs _ contains 334 objects in our field ; we obtained matches to 159 of these using a 30  matching radius .",
    "as mentioned above , one of our sources matched to two independent _ gcvs _ sources , so that only 158 of our sources were classified in the _",
    "gcvs_. to match we used _",
    "2mass _ coordinates for our objects where available .",
    "there are 82 matches that lie within 5 .",
    "we take a liberal matching radius 30  to allow for matches to variables that do not have _",
    "2mass _ coordinates , as well as to allow for the possibility that some of our variables are matched to the incorrect",
    "_ 2mass _ counterpart .",
    "we also note that the positions in the _ gcvs _ catalog may come from a wide variety of epochs , further necessitating the liberal matching radius .    of the 176",
    "_ gcvs _ variables that do not match with one of our variables , 111 of these have @xmath65 and are thus likely to either be too faint to detect as stars , or so faint that the variations are lost in the background noise in our observations .",
    "there are 24 unmatched variables with @xmath66 that appear to be correlated with saturated stars in our i - band observations . of the remaining 40",
    ", there are 9 eclipsing binaries , 7 of which are algol - like ( ea ) , and could go undetected if none of the eclipses are observed , or if only small portions of a few eclipses are observed .",
    "there are 8 miras for which the change in magnitude over 30 days may have been too small to detect .",
    "of these 8 , the 5 that have ephemerides available in the _ gcvs _ appear to have been too dim to detect during the observations , or varied by an amount less than 10 @xmath16 above the noise .",
    "there are 19 semi - regular and slow irregular variables , all of which may have only varied slightly over the course of our observation",
    ". finally we can expect @xmath67 _ gcvs _ variables to be excluded from the catalog due to variability blending .",
    "we see that we can account for all of the _ gcvs _ variables in our field to which we did not obtain matches .",
    "we also matched our catalog to the new catalogue of suspected variable stars , including the supplemental series ( _ nsv _ , kukarkin et al.1982 ) .",
    "using the same matching radius as above , we obtained matches to 20 sources .",
    "the _ nsv _",
    "designation for these confirmed variables is provided in our catalog .",
    "there have also been some more recent searches for variability in fields overlapping this one .",
    "notably alonso et al .  ( 2003 ) , as part of the stare project , found that over 40 of the @xmath68 stars observed in their cyg0 field had pulsation periods between 5 and 40 days .",
    "of these they identify hd227269 as a highly eccentric eclipsing binary showing possible pulsations .",
    "we do detect hd227269 as an eclipsing binary , and also see the same pulsations ( fig .",
    "[ lc2743_mag.data ] ) .",
    "alonso et al .",
    "mention , however , that a dss image of the star reveals a companion that is similar in brightness within @xmath19 . at this separation",
    "the stars would be blended in our observations , and it is possible that the pulsations are not occurring in the binary system , though this system does merit further investigation .    another transit search that we overlap with is the vulcan photometer project which has found over 50 eclipsing binaries out of 6000 stars observed ( borucki et al .",
    "2001 ) . of the brightest 6000 stars we observed ,",
    "24 were eclipsing binaries .",
    "however , because our brightest stars may contain many more blended objects than the 6000 relatively isolated stars observed by vulcan , these two populations may not be directly comparable .",
    "the differences in the detection rates may also be partially explained by differences in classifications .",
    "we should also note that the vulcan binaries include many low - amplitude systems which may not have @xmath69 and hence would not be flagged as `` large - amplitude '' variables by our method .",
    "in  4.4 we made use of the nsvs light curve database ( wozniak et al.2004 ) to manually check the rejected template3-like light curves to determine if any of these showed variability in an independent experiment .",
    "it may be useful in the future to also compare our entire catalog of variables with the nsvs database , however that is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "as mentioned in  4.3 , we cataloged any object whose light curve was well - fit by a 2nd order polynomial as an lpv .",
    "we identified 1169 lpvs , of which 1026 are newly discovered variables .",
    "of the known variables , 19 are newly confirmed _",
    "nsv _ sources .",
    "figure [ lpvfig ] shows a few of the interesting cases .",
    "the majority of the lpvs are likely to be mira variables which all have periods longer than our 30 day window .",
    "indeed 77 of the 97 matched lpvs are known miras .",
    "recently there has been a great deal of interest in pinning down the various p - l relations for miras observed by the microlensing surveys ( e.g.  wood et al .  1999 ,",
    "wood  2000 , and most recently groenewegen  2004 ) .",
    "all of these have used observations of the large and small magellanic clouds where the distances can be factored out of the relations . because we can not assume a uniform distance for our observations , this population of miras will likely be less useful towards this endeavor .",
    "our population , however , is substantially brighter and hence may be more useful for detailed investigations of agb stars .",
    "figure  [ cmd1 ] shows the location of the lpvs on a j vs. j - k color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",
    "the infrared magnitudes j , and k are taken from the match to _ 2mass_. as expected the lpvs are generally redder than the majority of stars , and tend to lie along the giant branch of the cmd .    among the more exotic variables that we classify as lpvs",
    "are v1016 cyg , a well - studied symbiotic nova whose cool component is a @xmath70 day mira ( e.g.  see parimucha  2003 ) , and a few rv tau stars including gk cyg , and v967 cyg .",
    "we identified 207 large amplitude ( full amplitude greater than 0.032 mag ) variables that show periods less than 14 days ; 180 of these are newly discovered .",
    "as discussed in  4.5 this cutoff at 14 days was to ensure that any star classified as periodic had been observed for two full periods .",
    "we further classified the periodic light curves into 157 eclipsing binary - like ( eb ) light curves , and 50 pulsating variable - like light curves .",
    "figure  [ ebfig ] shows light curves for 48 of the ebs , and figure  [ pulfig ] shows 48 of the pulsating variables ( the other two pulsating variables are shown in figure  [ multiperiod ] ) .    of the 30 periodic variables matched to _",
    "objects , 11 are algol type ebs , 3 are @xmath71 lyr type ebs , 5 are wuma type ebs , 3 are cepheids , 1 is a population ii cepheid , and 4 are rr lyr variables .",
    "one short period ( 0.224 days ) pulsating variable has a match in the _ nsv _ catalog .",
    "the other known periodic variable which has no counterpart in the _ gcvs _ is hd227269 ( see  5.1 ) .",
    "figure  [ cmd2 ] shows the location of the periodic variables ( separated into pulsating and eclipsing categories ) on a j vs.  j - k cmd .",
    "compared to the lpvs and miscellaneous variables ( fig  [ cmd1 ] ) these objects tend to be blue . for the pulsating stars this",
    "is expected as we are only classifying stars with periods less than 15 days as periodic , and the shorter period stars tend to be denser and hotter ( e.g.  @xmath72 scuti ) .",
    "the two most studied of the matched objects are ww cyg , an ea / sd binary , and cv cyg , a ew / dw binary . because ww cyg shows very deep primary eclipses ( 3.5 mag in v ) it has been frequently observed over the last century . as a result",
    "this system has been particularly useful in probing the period changes in close binaries ( zavala et al .",
    "our observations reveal much shallower eclipses in i ( 2.05 mag ) and clearly reveal the secondary eclipses ( 0.15 mag in i ) which have hitherto been undetected in v. struve  ( 1946 ) determined that the primary has spectral type b8 , while yoon et al .",
    "( 1994 ) assigned a spectroscopic type g9 to the secondary .",
    "the difference of @xmath73 in the amplitude of the primary eclipse in v and i suggests that the secondary should have a later spectral type ( later than k3 ) .",
    "however yoon et al .",
    "point out that the photometrically determined spectral types for algol secondaries are typically later than the spectroscopically determined ones .",
    "cv cyg is a highly evolved eclipsing system that has been used primarily for the study of period and amplitude changes in close binaries ( demircan et al .",
    "because the period is nearly 1 day ( 0.983 days ) we do not observe both the primary and secondary eclipses , however we do obtain approximately 15 minima observations .    the light curve of one very interesting object that we observe in shown in figure  [ lc4144_mag ] .",
    "this object matches the known ea / ke binary v1171 cyg discovered by wachmann ( 1966 ) .",
    "it has also been detected as a visual double with 034 separation by couteau  ( 1981 ) .",
    "the system has spectral type b9 as listed on simbad .",
    "we obtain an orbital period for this system of p=1.462d , and also observe an upper envelope modulation with period p=4.857d and full - amplitude @xmath74 mag in i. to further analyze this system we obtained spectroscopy using the flwo 1.5 m telescope . the spectra show color changes , which indicate that this is not a random blend with another variable more than @xmath21 away .",
    "the light curve appears to be very similar to hd227269 (  5.1 and fig .",
    "[ lc2743_mag.data ] ) , however in this case we have greater confidence that the pulsations and eclipses are occurring in the same system .",
    "we suspect that we are looking at a triple system with a cepheid as one component .",
    "evans et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have found that a large fraction of cepheids exist in triple systems , but have been unable to determine the masses of all 3 stars in a given system .",
    "if this system is indeed a triple , it may be possible to measure all three masses and thereby add to our picture of the distribution of masses among massive multiple systems ( n.  evans , private communication ) .",
    "we have also observed a number objects which appear to be short period pulsating stars .",
    "these objects have periods between 0.1 and 0.3 days , and may well correspond to @xmath72 scuti type variables .",
    "a number of these objects show multiple , non - harmonic periods .",
    "this includes hat199 - 539 which appears to have at least two periods , one at 0.1069d and another at 0.1198d , and hat199 - 5178 with periods at 0.1203d and 0.1367d ( fig .",
    "[ multiperiod ] ) .",
    "variables which were not selected as lpvs and for which the best fit period was longer than 14 days were classified as miscellaneous .",
    "this classification may include a number of periodic variables with periods typically between 14 - 30 days , as well as a number of irregular variables that have timescales shorter than 30 days .",
    "we identified 241 such cases , of which all but 4 are newly discovered .",
    "the four matched cases include : v482 cyg , an rcb star , v1920 cyg , a pv telescopii variable , v546 cyg , an algol - like eclipsing binary , and v811 cyg , an ss cyg type dwarf nova .",
    "light curves of these , and other interesting miscellaneous variables are shown in fig  [ miscfig ] .",
    "v482 cyg is a well studied member of the rare class of stars known as r coronae borealis ( rcb ) variables .",
    "these carbon - rich variables are noted for their unpredictable and substantial drops in brightness that are attributed to the formation of soot clouds in the stellar atmosphere .",
    "v482 cyg was in the quiescent state during the observations , however we do observe a pulsation - like light curve that suggests a period of around 30 days ( fig  [ miscfig ] ) .",
    "this oscillation is very similar to the 39-day period , cepheid - like pulsations observed in ry sgr ( see for example lawson & cottrell , 1990 ) .",
    "v1920 cyg is an extreme helium star which morrison & willingale(1987 ) observed to vary with an amplitude of 0.07 mag in v and a period of 3 to 4 days .",
    "fadeyev  ( 1990 ) interpreted these variations as pulsations in the second or higher overtone , and used them to constrain the absolute magnitude of the star .",
    "our observations of v1920 cyg over 30 days reveal irregular variations with no discernible period , but with a timescale of roughly 4 days .",
    "we observe a maximum full - amplitude of 0.2 mag in i ( fig  [ miscfig ] ) .",
    "this variable is the bluest miscellaneous variable shown in fig  [ cmd1 ] .",
    "v811 cyg is classified in the _ gcvs _ as a ugss type variable .",
    "these stars are dwarf novae that show regular , symmetric outbursts typically lasting 3 - 10 days .",
    "we observe one such outburst for v811 cyg with a time - span of roughly 10 days and amplitude of @xmath75 in i. it is interesting to note that our observations of v811 cyg have a quiescent i of @xmath76 whereas spogli et al .",
    "( 2002 ) measured @xmath77 in 1995 .",
    "a likely interpretation is that we have observed a blend between v811 cyg and another brighter source .",
    "although the light curve we identify with v811 cyg is one of the variables that does not have a match with _",
    "2mass _ , we do identify two sources in the full _ 2mass _ catalog that lie within 10  of our coordinates for the object .",
    "these sources have @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 . a blend of these two objects in daophot / allstar into a single object can account for the @xmath76 quiescent i. note that the coordinates for v811 cyg in the _ gcvs _ are more than 10  from our coordinates for the object .    one interesting miscellaneous variable that has not previously been detected as a variable is hat199 - 1753 which shows a flare - like brightening by at least 0.08 mag over the course of 5 hours .",
    "unfortunately the light curve is interrupted by several bad nights .      as a test of our ability to detect very low amplitude periodic variables we performed the schwarzenberg - czerny period finding test ( see  5.3 ) on the 8,949 light curves that had @xmath81 mmag and @xmath82 . using this scheme we selected an additional 71 light curves that had @xmath83 days , and @xmath84 for the best period , and did not lie near the 1/2 or 1/3 harmonic of one day .",
    "we only selected objects that were more than 6 pixels from a variable in our catalog to avoid issues of variability blending .",
    "we then analyzed these light curves by eye and selected a list of 29 probable low - amplitude pulsating variables .",
    "we show light curves for a few of these in figure  [ figlowamp ] , some of which have full - amplitudes approaching 10 mmag .",
    "this is not a systematic search for these variables ; we present the results simply to demonstrate our capability of finding very low amplitude variables in a high density field",
    ". we will continue observations of this field and present results from a systematic search for transits and other low amplitude variability in a future paper .",
    "by using image subtraction photometry we have obtained light curves for over 98,000 objects in a single field near the galactic plane . from these light curves",
    "we have identified 1617 variable stars with amplitudes greater than @xmath85 mag , of which 1439 are new .",
    "these include 1026 new lpvs , 176 new periodic variables and 237 new miscellaneous variables .",
    "the fact that 89% of the variables were previously undetected further demonstrates the vast number of variables yet to be discovered even among fairly bright stars in our galaxy ( paczyski  1997 ) .",
    "we will continue our observations of this field in the hopes of detecting planetary transits as well as other low amplitude variables by means of extending our baseline . using rudimentary selection techniques we have already identified as many as 29 periodic variables with amplitudes less than 0.05 mag . besides the detection of low - amplitude variables , future observations should also help in determining the nature of the variables we have already discovered .",
    "to select a reference for alignment we measured the full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) values of all the images and then chose an image which had one of the smallest fwhms , circular profiles , and had good spatial overlap with the remaining images . at this point",
    "we also examined images with extreme values for fwhm ( typically frames for which the program failed ) .",
    "many of these turned out to be partially obscured by clouds , or have irregular background patterns whose cause could not always be determined .",
    "these images were removed before proceeding with registration / subtraction .    before proceeding with subtraction we had to establish a set of subtraction parameters .",
    "these parameters include the number of independent regions in which to divide the images ( sub_x and sub_y ) , the form of the kernel to use ( including the number of gaussians , the `` width '' of the gaussians , the orders of the polynomials associated with each gaussian , the order of the polynomial used to fit spatial variations in the kernel , and the order of the polynomial used to fit spatial variations in the background ) , and the sizes ( in pixels ) of the regions used for fitting the kernel ( half_stamp_size ) as well as for performing the psf transformation with the kernel ( half_mesh_size ) .",
    "we first created a preliminary reference image from 30 of the lowest fwhm images , using a trial guess for the parameters .",
    "we then ran the isis routine `` subtract.csh '' using several permutations of the parameters ( we varied the number of subregions , and the degree of background and spatial variations ) . for each permutation",
    "we calculated the standard deviation and mean of the subtracted images .",
    "we then chose the set of parameters which produced the lowest average standard deviation and mean .",
    "these include internally dividing each frame into 25 independent sub - frames ( sub_x = sub_y = 5 ) , using a first order polynomial to fit the background variations and first order polynomial to fit the spatial variations in the kernel , fitting with 3 gaussians , that had `` widths '' of 0.7 , 2.0 and 4.0 respectively , and associated polynomials of order 6 , 4 and 3 respectively , and choosing a half_mesh_size of 11 pixels and a half_stamp_size of 19 pixels .",
    "the internal subdivision is the most important parameter in our case .",
    "this is because the isis implementation of image subtraction assumes flux conservation over the whole field from image to image . for a wide fov",
    "this does not generally hold ( due to , for example , differential atmospheric extinction over the field ) .",
    "it becomes necessary to subdivide the field into regions over which the flux conservation assumption holds within the limits set by photon noise / sky background .",
    "we empirically find that subdividing into more than 25 sections yields negligible improvement to the standard deviation of the subtracted images ( and the light curves of a selected sample of stars ) while significantly increasing the computation time .    after obtaining a final reference image ( composed of 47 images ) for subtraction , we performed subtraction on all the images . at this point",
    "we sorted the subtracted images by standard deviation and mean , examining images with large standard deviations and/or means significantly different from zero .",
    "this procedure allowed us to identify images with subtle cloud patterns , etc .",
    ", which might contaminate the photometry . since image subtraction assumes that the flux of all stars scales by a constant from image to image , any complex background variations / clouds will yield significant residuals over an entire sub - region of the subtracted image .",
    "the ease with which very subtle differences in images can be identified is one advantage of using image subtraction over methods to directly measure photometry on original images .    after cleaning ,",
    "we were left with 800 out of 935 images on which to proceed with photometry .",
    "we obtained the light curves for 98,000 objects using the `` phot.csh '' routine contained in the isis package .",
    "this procedure first determines a psf within a region of size psf_width pixels on the reference image .",
    "this is done by taking the median profile of a stack of bright stars .",
    "the profiles for each star are interpolated ( using a cubic b - spline ) onto a common grid .",
    "spatial variations in the psf are accounted for by splitting the image into several sub - areas .",
    "the routine then uses the best - fit kernel to transform it into the psf for the subtracted image .",
    "it then measures the flux within a radius of radphot pixels from a specified location , weighting it by the psf , and normalizes by the integral of the psf squared over a region of radius rad_aper pixels .",
    "these difference flux measurements can be converted into instrumental magnitude light curves for each object using the flux on the reference image measured by daophot / allstar .    in converting from flux to magnitudes",
    "it is important to ensure that the flux measured by daophot / allstar is properly scaled to the flux measured by isis .",
    "the daophot / allstar fluxes correspond to the flux from psf fitting using a zero - point of 25.0 magnitudes . in general , this flux is _ not _ equal to the total number of adus in the image contributed by the star in question . for a large aperture radius ,",
    "the latter value is what is measured by `` phot.csh . '' to determine the scaling between the two `` fluxes '' we perform an aperture correction as follows : after fitting a psf to 98,000 stars in the field , we subtract a number of these stars from the reference image leaving only a sparsely populated image .",
    "we then perform aperture photometry on the remaining stars in this sparse image ( using a large aperture radius of 7 pixels ) . comparing the aperture magnitudes with the psf magnitudes we find that the psf magnitudes are consistently brighter by 0.19 mag .",
    "we can correct for this difference in scaling by using a zero - point of @xmath86 magnitudes for the daophot / allstar reference magnitudes of our program stars .    to optimize the isis photometry parameters we ran the `` phot.csh '' procedure iteratively on a small subset of the 98,000 objects with magnitudes across the entire range .",
    "the parameters we varied include ( rad_aper ) , the psf_width , and the inner / outer radii of the annulus for measuring the background ( rad1_bg and rad2_bg ) .",
    "we related the parameters so that @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "we also independently varied the radius for photometry ( radphot ) with little effect .",
    "we find that when the aperture radius is reduced below 7 pixels for our fwhm of @xmath1  3 pixels the amplitude of the light curves ( including the rms ) is artificially reduced , and the light curves of variable stars ( especially large amplitude variable stars ) become exessively noisy .",
    "we believe that this is the result inaccurately determining the psf ( increasing the noise of the variable stars ) while simultaneously providing a flux that is not properly scaled ( yielding lower amplitudes ) .",
    "for rad_aper greater than 7 pixels the effect on the light curves is minimal , with a slight increase in the noise for the dim stars due to sampling more of the background .",
    "the final set of photometry parameters that we chose include : rad_aper = 7 pixels , psf_width = 17 pixels , radphot = 3.0 pixels , rad1_bg = 15.0 pixels and rad2_bg = 20.0 pixels .    after obtaining light curves for all the stars in our field",
    ", we checked to see if there were any remaining bad frames . to do this we calculated the rms of each light curve and then calculated , for each frame , the number of light curves for which the magnitude of that frame was more than 3-@xmath16 from the mean .",
    "we identified 12 frames that were consistently `` bad '' in a large number of light curves .",
    "these frames were contaminated by clouds , or airplane tracks , or simply had subtracted images with substantial residuals and background gradients whose cause could not be identified on the original image . after removing these frames from every light curve we were left with a total of 788 contributing frames .",
    "several of the light curves contained an excessive number of outlier points as a result of lying near the edge of the field . to clean these light curves we removed any point with a formal flux error less than 15 adu as determined by the `` phot.csh '' routine ( the average flux error being @xmath1  40 adu for the dimmest stars ) .",
    "some light curves also contained bad points as a result of lying near a saturated star .",
    "because the profile of saturated stars is not fit by the psf , these stars yield significant residuals on the subtracted images . since these residuals change from image to image the contribution of this residual to the aperture of a nearby star changes . for dim stars this effect dominates such that occasionally the difference flux measured by `` phot.csh '' is more negative than the flux of the star itself as measured by daophot .",
    "these can be eliminated by removing all points with negative infinity magnitude from the light curves .",
    "the variability induced by proximity to saturated stars is difficult to distinguish from actual variability , we have attempted to account for these using templates to remove `` bad '' light curves (  4.4 ) .",

    "<S> these observations include 788 5-minute exposures over 30 days . </S>",
    "<S> for the brightest stars ( i @xmath1 8.0 ) we achieved a precision of 3.5 millimagnitudes , falling to 0.1 magnitudes at the faint end ( i @xmath1 14 ) . from these light curves </S>",
    "<S> we identify 1617 variable stars , of which 1439 are newly discovered . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that nearly @xmath2% of the variables were previously undetected further demonstrates the vast number of variables yet to be discovered even among fairly bright stars in our galaxy . </S>",
