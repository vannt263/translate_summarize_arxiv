    "ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) are particles coming to the atmosphere of the earth with energies that can exceed @xmath1 ev . while the first observation of cosmic rays ( crs ) was made one hundred years ago , origins of these particles is not yet understood .",
    "much of the reason is because of the very low flux of uhecrs at earth .",
    "the differential flux of uhecrs is steeply falling with energy , and can be described by a power law @xmath2 with spectral index @xmath3 between 2.6 and 3.2 .",
    "one can find two significant points in the energy spectrum  at @xmath4 ev there is so called knee where @xmath3 changes from 2.7 to 3.1 @xcite and known ankle can be found at @xmath5 ev with another spectral index change from 3.3 to 2.6  @xcite . processes and mechanisms of achieving ultra - high energies are still undiscovered .",
    "so the main questions which people want to answer concern composition , energy spectrum and sources of uhecrs .",
    "primary crs hitting the earth s atmosphere interact with air molecules and fragment.the secondary particles produced in this collision will undergo further hadronic and electromagnetic interactions , ultimately producing an extensive air shower cascade .",
    "as the air shower develops in the atmosphere the number of secondary particles increases and their average energy falls . due to energy losses and decays ,",
    "the shower will reach a maximum size , and then number of particles in the shower will begin to decrease .",
    "however , there are still enough energetic particles in a vertical air shower which can hit ground and can be detected by ground detectors . with increasing zenith angle of the primary particle",
    "an air shower must propagate through larger atmospheric mass and therefore only less particles survive at the ground level .",
    "there are two possible types of uhecr detection  direct and indirect methods .",
    "direct methods can be performed by means of satellites and balloons , but can not considerably measure uhecr at energies larger than @xmath6 ev because of small statistics ( eq . [ eqflux ] ) . on",
    "the other hand indirect methods require sufficient energy @xmath7 ev to develop shower and large detector area is necessary .",
    "indirect methods are based on the measurement of secondary particles that reach the ground in array of cherenkov detectors , scintillators or muon detectors or on the collection of the isotropic fluorescence light .",
    "secondary charged particles in the shower excite nitrogen molecules , which then isotropically emit fluorescence light into several bands between 300 and 420 nm .",
    "these photons can be detected by fluorescence telescopes .    a picture of an sd station and fd building .",
    "each station has its own solar panel with battery and communication antenna .",

    "the pierre auger observatory @xcite is a facility studying uhecrs by means of two type of detectors : a surface detector ( sd ) which is composed of 1600 water cherenkov stations and a fluorescence detector ( fd ) that comprises 24 fluorescence telescopes .",
    "the southern site of the observatory is located in province mendoza in argentina near the city malarge ( @xmath8  w , @xmath9  s , 1420 m a.s.l . ) , the northern site is intended to be built in colorado , usa . the layout of the southern site detectors is shown in fig . [ figarray ] , and the picture of an sd station and an fd building is shown in fig .",
    "[ figsdfd ] .",
    "stations are deployed on a triangular grid with 1.5 km spacing .",
    "they cover an area of over 3000 km@xmath0 and they have nearly 100 @xmath10 duty cycle .",
    "there are 3 photomultipliers in pure water in each station .",
    "the pierre auger observatory is designed to measure uhecrs with energy above @xmath11  ev . however , there is also a low energy extension of sd station infill with plastic scintillators beneath the stations to detect muons ( amiga @xcite ) and a set of 3 fluorescence telescopes with high elevation called heat @xcite .",
    "an extensive program of atmospheric monitoring is essential part of the observatory not only to control uncertainties concerning fd .",
    "there are 4 buildings with 6 fluorescence telescopes each that overlook the area of sd stations ( fig . [ figarray ] ) .",
    "each telescope uses schmidt optics and consists of a wide - angle , segmented spherical mirror , a spherical focal plane , a uv 300 - 410 nm passband filter , and a refractive corrector ring at the aperture of the telescope .",
    "the telescope field of view is @xmath12 ( in azimuth ) x @xmath13 ( in elevation ) so each building has @xmath14 azimuth range ( the 3 high - elevation telescopes observe @xmath12 to @xmath15 in elevation ) .",
    "there are 440 photomultipliers in the focal plane which collect reflected light .",
    "the longitudinal profile of a shower is thus measured as an image of active pmt pixels along the shower axis .",
    "the layout of the fd geometry is shown in fig .",
    "[ figfdlayout ] .",
    "there are several trigger levels .",
    "the first level digitizes signals from an analog board in each pixel at 10 mhz .",
    "the second level trigger is also an internal trigger to search for track segments of at least five active pixels .",
    "every 100 ns , a scan over the full camera is performed and the triggered pixels are searched for track - like patterns .",
    "the third level trigger is a software algorithm that rejects events caused by lightning , muons which impact the focal plane , or randomly trigged pixels .",

    "charged particles at ground level are detected in sd stations while fluorescence light is collected in fd . ]",
    "fd telescopes are calibrated to find the proper conversion between digitized counts and the true light flux ( in photons ) .",
    "this calibration is performed in several steps using absolute and relative methods . the absolute calibration uses a calibrated light source ( known as a drum ) mounted at the telescope aperture @xcite . using the drum ,",
    "the light flux at each pixel is known and the response is measured .",
    "in addition to the drum calibration , vertical laser shots at wavelengths 337 and 355 nm @xcite are used as an independent calibration method . between absolute calibrations ( which occur several times per year ) , the relative response of each fluorescence camera",
    "is recorded using light pulses from leds and xenon flashers .",
    "the relative calibration occurs before and after each night of observations .      the two measurement techniques in use at the pierre auger observatory  surface detection and air fluorescence detection ",
    "are quite complementary .",
    "[ fighybriddetection ] ) . whereas sd has @xmath16 duty cycle time and acceptance can be calculated and it is model independent , fd has duty cycle of @xmath17 @xcite and acceptance depends on the atmospheric conditions ( model dependent ) .",
    "sd measurement corresponds to one slice of a calorimeter at the last stage of shower development . to get the energy only from sd , monte",
    "carlo interaction models are needed in experiments without fluorescence detectors . on the other side fd collects photons emitted during development of the shower .",
    "it enables to sample a shower along its axis .",
    "measured number of photons in different atmospheric slant depths can be converted to deposited energy to get shower longitudinal profile ( fig .",
    "[ figlogprof ] ) .",
    "then , the energy is measured directly with the atmosphere acting as a calorimeter for cr study .",
    "events that are measured simultaneously by fd and sd are called hybrid .",
    "apart from the energy another very important characteristic of the shower development is the position of shower maximum .",
    "shower maximum is the atmospheric depth where the shower longitudinal development reaches the maximum number of secondary particles .",
    "correction factor for the missing energy calculated by several models ( dots ) with fitted curves @xcite for proton and iron primaries . ]     correction factor for the missing energy calculated by several models ( dots ) with fitted curves @xcite for proton and iron primaries . ]",
    "electromagnetic energy losses of charged particles are responsible for emitted fluorescence light .",
    "therefore fd measures longitudinal shower profile .",
    "about @xmath18 photons are emitted between 300 and 400 nm per 1 mev loss .",
    "the total number of photons is proportional to the deposited energy of the air shower .",
    "thus , the profile integral gives almost the whole shower energy ( @xmath19 of the total energy at @xmath20 ev ) : @xmath21 the remaining part ( @xmath22 of the total energy at @xmath20 ev ) of the shower energy can not be directly measured by collecting emitted light .",
    "it concerns energy of neutrinos , muons and other particles which do not excite nitrogen molecules .",
    "this type of energy is called missing and it is not included in the integral of the energy deposit derived from fd data .",
    "nevertheless , one can calculate the correction factor that depends on the primary particle type and energy ( fig  [ figmisse ] ) .",
    "the biggest advantage of hybrid detection is the model independent energy calibration of the sd .",
    "the energies of hybrid events are determined from fd measurement , and then the signal from the sd can be calibrated .",
    "the sd records signals from electromagnetic and muonic shower component .",
    "one shower is typically large enough to hit many sd stations",
    ". therefore one can derive ( fit ) the lateral distribution function of the signal at ground .",
    "the aim of such a procedure is to find the particle signal at a distance of 1000 m from the shower core ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the ground parameter @xmath23 depends on the zenith angle of the primary particle .",
    "the variable corrected for the zenith angle dependency is called @xmath24 and corresponds to signal @xmath23 at @xmath25 zenith angle .",
    "the calibration is based on finding the dependency of @xmath24 on the energy measured by fd ( fig .",
    "[ figcalib ] ) .      the use of the atmosphere as a calorimeter also determines the main uncertainties of the measurement .",
    "the total systematic uncertainty in the fd energy scale is @xmath26 , with the major contributions due to uncertainties in the fluorescence yield ( @xmath27 ) and atmospheric transmission ( @xmath28 for aerosol scattering , @xmath29 for rayleigh scattering ) .",
    "there are also @xmath30 uncertainties in the telescope absolute calibration , and the longitudinal shower profile reconstruction contributes @xmath31 to the total energy uncertainty .",
    "missing energy gives @xmath32 uncertainty .",

    "for example , the central laser facility  @xcite , lidar stations  @xcite , and the fram telescope  @xcite are used for atmospheric monitoring program .",
    "the measurement of the shower maximum requires a conversion of geometrical altitude as observed by fd to atmospheric depth .",
    "the conversion depends on temperature , pressure and humidity , which vary with time and location .",
