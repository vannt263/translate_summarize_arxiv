    "astrophysical blast waves are strongly suspected of amplifying the ambient magnetic field into which they propagate .",
    "supernova remnants ( snr ) , given detailed models for their ultra high energy gamma ray emission , indicate magnetic fields that are considerably stronger than the several @xmath1 g fields that are present in the interstellar medium .",
    "the exact strength of snr magnetic fields depends on how small - scale bright spots are interpreted @xcite .",
    "gamma ray bursts ( grb ) afterglows , which are attributed to relativistic blast waves , are generally best fit with a magnetic field strength that is much higher than interstellar magnetic fields .",
    "it has been suggested that the weibel instability is responsible for the magnetic field production / amplification @xcite , but several difficulties with this proposal @xcite remain unsolved .",
    "first , the fastest growing weibel - unstable modes are of very small scale , the ion plasma skin depth , and they should decay away resistively over the hydrodynamical timescale of the blast wave .",
    "second , the electrons in the actual interstellar medium are already magnetized as they enter the shock , and they should therefore freeze the magnetic flux . the weibel instability , which creates new flux , should therefore be suppressed at finite amplitudes , despite being unstable at infinitesimal amplitudes .",
    "it is not clear that these problems are resolved by simulations , which can not be run over hydrodynamical timescales , and which do not always include initial electron magnetization . in this regard , the bell instability @xcite , which treats the thermal plasma as a magnetized fluid may be more relevant than kinetic approaches that ignore the electron magnetization , i.e. , that their gyro radii are small compared with the relevant length scales of the system .",
    "cosmic ray ( cr ) protons above 200 tev and iron nuclei above 3 pev are difficult to account for with standard snr parameters @xcite , and magnetic field amplification would solve this problem if it occurs on a large scale .",
    "the smaller the scale of field amplification , the lower the maximum energy of the crs that can be accelerated by the shock @xcite .    simulations of magnetic fields in the presence of cosmic rays @xcite show magnetic field stretching .",
    "this is accompanied by a jumbling of the field lines into a more complicated geometry , and a smaller coherence length .",
    "it has remained unclear whether this is merely turbulent field line stretching or whether there is an additional mechanism .",
    "it has recently been noted by @xcite that a circularly polarized alfvn wave gives a net electromotive force ( emf ) along the direction of the original magnetic field .",
    "because cosmic ray protons preferentially excite alfvn waves of a particular circular polarization , they generate a net emf along the original magnetic field .",
    "the field growth is given by the curl of this emf which , for a plane wave , is @xmath2 , yielding a growing alfvn mode , whose polarization vector @xmath2 is perpendicular to the original magnetic field .",
    "to lowest order , this does not amplify the field but merely bends it , and the question still remains as to whether ( i ) the field lines are merely getting stretched on this large scale , which would leave the net flux through any large - scale surface unchanged , or whether ( ii ) there is organized amplification , whereby the flux of magnetic field lines though a given large - scale surface is increased .    in this paper we note that the situation can result in an @xmath3 dynamo , in which a large - scale magnetic field can grow along its original direction and thus get amplified .",
    "the effect results from a nonlinear coupling between the individual waves that were demonstrated by @xcite to grow .",
    "however , there is a maximum size over which such amplification can be effective .",
    "as the quantity @xmath0 has dimensions of velocity ( in contrast to the stretching timescale , which has dimensions of time and which can be as short as the eddy turnover time of the turbulence ) , this maximum spatial scale is of the order of @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the age of the blast wave .",
    "the magnetic field on this scale can grow by at most of the order of one @xmath6-fold over this time . on the other hand , because the field is amplified along its original direction , scales below the maximum scale can grow exponentially , in contrast to mere stretching , which would continually alter the scale as the field lines lengthen .",
    "the formal objective of the present work is to show that the parameter @xmath0 , as defined in standard dynamo theory , is non - zero in the presence of cosmic ray streaming instabilities , and to estimate its value .",
    "this will imply a maximum amount of growth on any given scale over any given time interval .",
    "the partial pressure @xmath7 in cosmic rays in any logarithmic interval of energy above energy @xmath8 is about @xmath9 @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath10 is the streaming velocity , @xmath11 is the plasma density , @xmath12 is the interstellar number density of protons , @xmath13 is the mass of a plasma ion , and @xmath14 is the cr s lorentz factor .",
    "thus , the high energy cr number density is @xmath15 the cosmic ray current @xmath16 due to crs within a given logarithmic interval of cr energy can then be factored into dimensionless parameters as follows : @xmath17 we will show in the present study that @xmath18 is a key parameter that determines large - scale magnetic field amplification .",
    "the last factor @xmath19 in equation  ( [ keyparameter ] ) is the deflection of the cr over its passage through one scale length , @xmath20 , of the magnetic field .",
    "the derivation of the bell instability that is caused by the cr current in plasma , assumes that the deflection of the cr is small . for the firehose instability ,",
    "the subject of a separate investigation , it can be larger than unity , as the crs would be bound to the field lines .",
    "however , a situation can occur in which the crs maintain a steady anisotropy , @xmath21 , even if they scatter , and the choice for the streaming velocity is then @xmath22 , and the shock velocity is assumed to be approximately the same .",
    "the factor @xmath23 is typically of the order of @xmath24 or less , both for the galaxy as a whole , where the anisotropy is limited by direct measurements , and for the cosmic rays accelerated by forward shocks of blast waves from supernovae remnants ( snr ) , where the cr precursor moves essentially at the shock velocity , typically @xmath25 to @xmath24 times @xmath26 .",
    "very young snr can have somewhat higher shock velocities , but the cr accelerated in them may then be more prone to adiabatic losses .",
    "note that because we assume the streaming velocity to be the velocity of the shock , we may allow for the possibility that crs scatter in our estimate of the cr current .",
    "but we still have to limit the time over which a given parcel of fluid is exposed to the cr current to be less than the shock crossing time  the time it takes the shock to cross the length of the cr precursor at that energy .    the factor",
    "@xmath27 is of the order of unity for the galaxy as a whole if all relativistic crs are included . in this case",
    ", the anisotropy must be taken to be at most @xmath25 and @xmath28 .",
    "in the case of supernova blast waves , the factor @xmath29 can be as high as @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the alfvn speed .",
    "thus , the cr pressure can be a significant fraction of the ram pressure @xmath32 ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "altogether , we can choose a plausible value for @xmath18 of @xmath33 which , for supernova remnants ( snr ) , can range from @xmath34 for young snr ( @xmath35 ) to order unity for old ones .",
    "for the galaxy as a whole , we are probably limited to @xmath36 . for collisionless shock waves generated in the interstellar medium by grbs ,",
    "the value of @xmath18 can be enormous  of order @xmath37 , and the @xmath0 effect may be particularly effective in that context .",
    "this will be discussed in greater detail below , where relativistic effects are included more carefully .",
    "the physical time over which the mechanism can operate on a given patch of upstream fluid in the case of a snr is one expansion time , or @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the radius of the forward shock .",
    "as @xmath10 does not appear explicitly in the simulation parameters , we use the above expression @xmath40 to substitute for @xmath10 in terms of @xmath41 and @xmath31 . for the galaxy as a whole ,",
    "we are limited by the hubble time to be about @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the size of the galaxy .",
    "we consider magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) flows consisting of background plasma ions of number density @xmath12 , electrons of number density @xmath44 , and cosmic ray protons of number density @xmath45 .",

    ".      we will show in this study that , formally , there are two contributions to the @xmath0 effect caused by : ( i ) existing kinetic helicity produced by the bell - instability ( referred to as @xmath100 below ; ( ii ) correlations in the forcing by the mean cosmic ray current in the presence of small - scale anisotropic magnetic fluctuations which create further perturbation @xmath101 in the velocity field @xmath102 . effect ( ii ) causes opposite sides of a magnetic loop to be forced in opposite directions , thereby twisting the loop out of its original plane .",
    "the distinction between the two terms may be more formal than physical .",
    "that is , in an unstable circularly polarized alfvn mode , the additional helicity added by the cosmic ray forcing term is merely a continuation of the process that formed the already existing helicity .    the @xmath0 effect , however , is distinct from the linear growth of the circularly polarized alfvn wave .",
    "it can be thought of as one circularly polarized alfvn wave riding on another , somewhat longer wavelength alfvn wave ( which need not be circularly polarized ) .",
    "the longer wave makes a perpendicular component to the original field , while the stretching of the perpendicular component ( into a loop , say ) together with the twisting of the loop restores newly created flux back into the original direction .",
    "it is the _ nonlinear coupling _ of two waves , each of which is of the sort discussed by @xcite .",
    "this coupling can scatter energy in the two modes of wavenumbers @xmath103 , @xmath104 into modes of much longer wavelength , and thereby amplify the field at large scale in its original direction .",

    "the total @xmath0 effect is the sum of the two contributions : @xmath124    the mechanism of the second contribution , @xmath125 , to the @xmath0 effect can be understood by the following reasoning .",

    "@xmath131 are the magnetic fluctuations resulting directly from the bell instability , just like the velocity perturbations @xmath102 .",

    "now let us compare this mechanism for the @xmath0 effect with the standard mechanism based on nonzero kinetic helicity .",

    "more importantly , however , the quasi - kinematic and fully nonlinear test - field methods agree with each other within machine precision , confirming thus the applicability of the quasi - kinematic method to the present case .",
    "our results seem consistent with the following interpretation .",
    "there appear to be three distinct stages .",
    "in the first stage , the @xmath330 force ( which we refer to as the lorentz force due to the  counter - cr current \"  i.e.  the current in the thermal plasma that cancels the cosmic ray current ) amplifies the motion perpendicular to the original , unperturbed magnetic field in one circular polarization of alfvn modes , thereby stretching the field such that it develops a component that is perpendicular to the original direction .",
    "this is the bell instability in our simulation , but anything that creates a perpendicular component might work just as well for this phase .",
    "the bell instability grows fastest on small scales and in a direction whose @xmath331 vector is parallel to the @xmath79 axis .",
    "tentatively , we may attribute the increasing preference for `` perpendicular '' energy that we see in the simulation , i.e.  energy in motion in the  perpendicular \" ( @xmath213 and @xmath214 ) directions , to the faster growth rate of on - axis ( @xmath332 ) alfvn waves .",
    "however , there is clearly significant parallel energy , even in the linear growth regime , presumably due to off - axis waves .",
    "the reason that the ratio of  parallel \" to  perpendicular \" energy decreases in the first stage is presumably because the on - axis waves , which have only motion perpendicular to the axis , are the fastest growing modes .    during the first stage",
    ", the ratio of @xmath333 to @xmath334 grows exponentially , because for any given mode , @xmath335 is proportional to @xmath336 , and @xmath337 is growing exponentially ( figure  [ pcomp_lam ] ) , consistent with the linear bell instability .",
    "the correlation length of both the magnetic field and the turbulence , apart from a drop in the very early stages , remains more or less constant , and corresponds to the scale of the fastest growing modes .",
    "the second stage is much like the first , except that the growth rate of the larger scale , low @xmath232 , modes begins to increase above its linear value ; see figure  [ pspec_compt2_tot ] .",
    "this is presumably due to the fact that their growth is dominated by nonlinear coupling of higher @xmath232 modes , which have developed much larger amplitudes than the low @xmath232 ones , even though they are still in the linear regime .",
    "the third stage , for @xmath338 ( @xmath339 ) , begins at about @xmath340 ( @xmath341 ) , as shown in the upper panel of figure  [ pcomp_lam ] .",
    "several things clearly happen at the onset of the second stage : ( i ) the growth of @xmath342 suddenly slows ( figure  [ pcomp_lam ] ) , ( ii ) the growth of the magnetic field also shows a change ( figure  [ pcomp_bb0 ] ) , though it continues to rise , ( iii ) the _ correlation lengths _ of both the magnetic field and the velocity begin to increase noticeably ( figure  [ ppower_kf_t512eo4x_powerbz ] ) , ( iv ) the ratio of @xmath0 to @xmath334 stops rising exponentially and either flattens out or grows much more slowly ( figs .",
    "[ palptest_comp ] and  [ pcomp_alp ] ) , ( v ) the turbulent magnetic diffusivity begins to rise significantly and dominates the microscopic value ( figure  [ peta ] ) , ( vi ) the ratio of energy in parallel magnetic field to that in perpendicular field rises sharply ( figure  [ pspec_compt2_rat ] ) , and ( vii ) a kolmogorov - type spectrum is reached from below , while the level of turbulence grows more slowly .",
    "all these changes can be understood in terms of nonlinear effects .",
    "once the turbulent velocity exceeds the alfvn velocity , the nonlinear convective term in the navier - stokes equation becomes as or more important than the lorentz force due to the counter - cr current , so that the stirring of the fluid by the latter , as expressed in unstable alfvn modes , is in equilibrium with eddy viscosity . by the same token ,",
    "the amplitude of the magnetic field is large , so that the @xmath3 dynamo is activated . taken in isolation , an exponentially growing @xmath0 effect would lead to super - exponential growth , but this is not what is seen .",
    "the sudden rise of parallel to perpendicular magnetic energy could perhaps be attributed to this effect , but , looking at the shape of the spectra in figures  [ ppower_all_ek_em_t512eo4x_powerbz ] and [ ppower_all_ek_em_t512eo5x_powerbz ] , and as said before , nonlinear mode coupling to the fastest growing modes , which here turn out to be at @xmath343 and 70 , respectively , is a likely explanation .    in this _ nonlinear stage _ , the ratio of parallel to perpendicular energy begins to grow , and the field attains larger scale and becomes more isotropic , as can be seen in figure  [ bx_t512eo4x ] .",
    "the @xmath3 dynamo can be interpreted as an inverse cascade , in which parallel and anti - parallel magnetic flux is generated by the stretching of perpendicular flux , while the anti - parallel flux is kinematically  pumped \" out of any given finite region of size @xmath344 at a velocity of order @xmath0 by the @xmath0 effect .",
    "the pumping of flux into large regions of size @xmath344 can be viewed from a modal point of view as inverse cascading of energy into small wavenumbers of order @xmath345 .",
    "the observed scaling of the time evolution with @xmath18 is reasonable : the timescale for @xmath339 is about a factor of @xmath346 times less than that for @xmath338 . because the stirring force of the counter - cr current is proportional to @xmath18 , one might expect velocities to scale as @xmath18 for a fixed correlation time .",
    "however , if an acceleration @xmath347 operates over a set distance @xmath348 , then the velocity scales only as @xmath349 . once the turbulent velocity exceeds @xmath350 , the amplitude of the transverse motion associated with a given mode is @xmath351 , and the correlation length varies more weakly than the correlation time with @xmath18 .",
    "so we expect that the timescale for the dynamo mechanism scales as @xmath352 , where @xmath353 , and this is what we observe ; @xmath354 .",
    "we have not verified how this scaling law extends to larger @xmath18 .    in kolmogorov turbulence ,",
    "the turbulent kinetic energy @xmath355 at any instant is proportional to @xmath356 , where @xmath50 is the stirring power . in a situation such as the present one , where the stirring force @xmath357 is proportional to @xmath358 , for a given stirring scale @xmath232 , the velocity @xmath359 scales as @xmath360 , the power is proportional to @xmath361 and the energy",
    "should then , by dimensional arguments , have a finite , steady state value that is proportional to @xmath357 .",
    "the point is that for a given @xmath362 , the energy @xmath363 has a finite value to which it should rise and flatten out .",
    "there is indication of this in our simulation results , as seen in figs .",
    "[ pspec_compt2_tot ] and [ pspec_compt2_rat ] , where the total turbulent energy flattens out at @xmath364 for @xmath365 ( @xmath366 for @xmath367 ) .",
    "it does not completely flatten out though , and we attribute this to the fact that @xmath368 is still creeping up with time due to the dynamo effect .",
    "our simulations are not long enough to determine whether the magnetic energy @xmath369 always reaches equipartition with the kinetic energy @xmath370 .",
    "if it does , then , because @xmath362 scales as @xmath371 , dimensional arguments suggest that the force @xmath357 , which scales as @xmath358 , therefore scales as @xmath372 .",
    "so , if @xmath359 scales as @xmath360 and thus @xmath370 scales as @xmath357 , then the force scales as @xmath373 .",
    "we believe it would take longer simulation runs that were presently feasible to check this prediction , and whether @xmath369 indeed scales as @xmath370 .",
    "in the above discussion we have invoked the bell instability to generate magnetic flux that is perpendicular to the local background , because this , from the point of view of the fluid , is an mhd effect and can be represented in an mhd simulation .",
    "we note , on the other hand , that non - mhd effects could achieve the same result .",
    "for example , the non - resonant firehose instability could achieve the same stretching .",
    "the helicity that is required for the @xmath0 effect relies on preferential growth of one circular polarization over the other , so the firehose instability on large scales , which has no such preference , could not by itself bring about an @xmath0 effect .",
    "however , it could combine with the resonant cyclotron instabilities to do so . in this case",
    ", the firehose instability would play the role that differential rotation plays in the @xmath374 dynamo  that of creating a perpendicular field component , while the helical turbulence that is generated by the bell instability would play the role of helical turbulence that , in the @xmath375 dynamo , is generated by the combination of convection in a stratified medium and coriolis force .",
    "in a real astrophysical system , there is a limited amount of time available . in the case of an expanding blast wave ,",
    "this is of order the expansion time .",
    "similarly , in an accretion shock , accreting matter continuously sweeps magnetic field downward over the crossing timescale of the accreting matter .",
    "the question is whether this is enough for significant magnetic field amplification .      in our simulations ,",
    "the growth up to maximum amplitude takes on the order of @xmath283 ( 0.08 ) alfvn crossing times across the box for @xmath338 ( @xmath376 ) ; see figs .",
    "[ ppower_all_ek_em_t512eo5x_powerbz][pcomp_lam ] . however , this total time interval witnesses a gain of many orders of magnitude of the level of large - scale magnetic field , because the simulation begins at the noise level . for @xmath338",
    "it can be seen from figs .",
    "[ pspec_compt2_tot ] and  [ ppower_all_ek_em_t512eo4x_powerbz ] that at @xmath377 , the growth at large scales speeds up , the energy in field perturbations at any given scale grows by a factor of @xmath378 per @xmath379 , and , at somewhat later times , by a factor of nearly @xmath380 per @xmath379 , suggesting that , during a period of exponential growth , the gain factor over an interval @xmath5 at wavenumber @xmath232 , is @xmath381 . for a supernova remnant of radius @xmath382",
    ", the precursor has a width @xmath383 of somewhat less than @xmath382 , and the largest mode has a wavenumber of order @xmath384 .",
    "thus , the available time @xmath5 for field amplification by cosmic ray current is @xmath385 , where @xmath386 is the alfvn mach number of the blast wave",
    ". then @xmath387 , suggesting that the @xmath0 dynamo effect could amplify the field energy of the remnant by a gain factor @xmath388 of order @xmath389 , and the amplification of the field s magnitude would be the square root of this factor , i.e. a factor of several for @xmath390 .",
    "this appears to be consistent with figure  [ pcomp_bu ] . according to equation  ( [ keyparameter ] ) , and assuming @xmath391",
    ", we see that raising the potential cr current by @xmath392 , speeds up the time evolution of the field amplification by @xmath393 , where @xmath394 is between 0.5 and 1 ; see the discussion above .",

    ", the magnetic energy on any given scale , @xmath395/(k_1/k)$ ] reaches , but does not significantly exceed , unity .    for young , expanding supernova remnants @xmath396 is typically @xmath380 , so the growth factor on the scale of the supernova could be of order one @xmath6-fold per expansion time if the assumptions of the simulation were to remain valid over the full interval . while not dramatic , neither is it insignificant in view of the uncertainties , a modest amount of magnetic field amplification may take place within an expanding supernova remnant , and this may be enough to be compatible with observational inferences @xcite . while the correlation length of the magnetic field increases with time , it is at all times less than the size of the box by a factor of several .",
    "on the other hand , increasing the shock velocity from @xmath397 to near @xmath26 would raise @xmath18 by a factor of @xmath398 , thereby speeding up the rate of field amplification by @xmath399 while decreasing the expansion time by only a factor of @xmath380 , so there would then seem to be enough time to amplify the magnetic field by many orders of magnitude even on the largest scale  as demonstrated in our simulations  if there are no other fundamental limitations that we have not yet identified .",
    "thus , grbs , which create ultrarelativistic shocks in the interstellar medium , would have the greatest potential for magnetic field amplification , because their ratio of particle pressure to initial magnetic pressure is so large .",
    "this is now discussed below .    in our simulations ,",
    "the velocity of the turbulence attains a magnitude of about @xmath400 , the magnetic field increases to @xmath401 times the original field @xmath321 , and the correlation length @xmath344 of this field is about @xmath402 of the box size @xmath382 .",
    "thus the quantity @xmath403 is not much changed from the original value @xmath404 , meaning that the maximum energy attainable by cosmic rays , @xmath405 @xcite , is not much changed by the magnetic field amplification .",
    "( however , until we are certain how the final correlation length scales with the running time of the simulation , this matter remains not completely settled . )    if the energy of the highest energy cosmic rays @xmath363 is taken to be @xmath406 then the deflection of these highest energy implied by ( though ignored in the simulations ) is probably small for @xmath407 . in general",
    ", the turbulent rms velocity @xmath334 should be somewhat less than the shock velocity , @xmath10 , so the potential drop @xmath408 across one correlation length @xmath344 is somewhat less than the maximum energy attainable with shock acceleration @xmath409 .",
    "this means that deflection is not a problem for the highest energy cosmic rays , but would be a problem for lower energy cr , and , to compute the cosmic ray current , we are entitled to figure in only crs of the highest energies , i.e.  above @xmath410 .",
    "magnetic field amplification that uses crs at lower energies is unlikely to help increase the maximum energy to which crs can be accelerated by shocks .    as mentioned above , the correlation length @xmath344 is probably considerably less than the size of the box , i.e.  the radius of the supernova remnant when applied to that context .",
    "it is possible that the rather large values of magnetic fields that have been claimed for young supernova remnants ( @xmath411 , i.e.  about @xmath380 times the interstellar field of the galaxy ) are observationally compatible with such a small scale .",
    "we define a weakly magnetized relativistic shock wave as one where the kinetic energy of the upstream fluid flowing into the shock greatly exceeds the magnetic energy , i.e.  where the upstream fluid is sufficiently magnetized as to be describable by mhd .",
    "particles reflecting off the shock have velocity @xmath412 in the frame of the shock , where @xmath413 is the shock velocity which we assume to be equal to the streaming velocity discussed in section  [ introduction ] . assuming @xmath414 , velocities of up to @xmath415 in the lab frame .",
    "the thickness of the shock precursor in the lab frame is thus of order @xmath416 , where @xmath39 is the radius of the shock . the current density in reflected ions , which we assume extend further upstream than the reflected electrons , is thus of order @xmath417 for typical grb parameters @xmath418 , @xmath419 , @xmath420 ( where @xmath421 is the shock lorentz factor ) , @xmath422 g , the dimensionless parameter defined in the introduction is @xmath423 for scales @xmath20 of order the reflected ion gyroradius",
    "this is a far larger value than anything that can be reliably simulated , because the fastest growing mode is of too small a scale to be resolvable numerically .",
    "the thickness of the precursor of reflected ions from the shock is determined by how far ahead of the shock the ions can get before they are overtaken by the shock .",
    "a reflected ion by definition moves faster along the shock normal than the shock itself at the moment the ion crosses upstream , and it is overtaken by the shock after it has gyrated approximately @xmath424 of its gyroradius @xmath425 , at which point its motion along the shock normal is less than that of the shock , so the shock overtakes it .",
    "thus , it has moved a distance of @xmath426 , whereas the shock has moved by @xmath427 .",
    "the thickness of the precursor is then @xmath428 .",
    "the time over which a parcel of fluid at radius @xmath382 is exposed to the reflected ion flux is @xmath429 and its ratio to the alfvn crossing time across the precursor is @xmath430    due to numerical limitations , it remains unclear how much magnetic field amplification can take place . while we have shown that perturbations can grow by many orders of magnitude",
    ", we do not have any runs in which the final magnetic field was more than a factor of 10 or so more than the original field . as we do not understand the nonlinear dissipation of magnetic field ,",
    "so we do not know _ a priori _ how the limiting field scales with @xmath18 .",
    "yet we argue on theoretical grounds that the @xmath0-dynamo should be able to amplify the field at relativistic or near relativistic shocks by a large factor , as it apparently does in many compact objects , and the existence of such a dynamo is ultimately due to the left ",
    "right asymmetry of the magnetic turbulence that is generated by the cosmic rays .",
    "let us now consider systems with lifetimes that are large compared to the alfvn crossing time , such as the galaxy . here there is enough time for the standard @xmath375 mean - field dynamo dynamo to work if there is a source of right - left asymmetric turbulence @xcite . in any system where the magnetic energy has attained rough equipartition between magnetic field and cosmic ray pressure",
    ", the ratio on the right hand side of equation  ( [ keyparameter ] ) obeys @xmath431 .",
    "the first ratio on the right hand side of equation  ( [ keyparameter ] ) @xmath23 , must also be less than unity",
    ". the third ratio in equation  ( [ keyparameter ] ) must also be less than unity for the assumption for the bell instability ( small deflection of the current - bearing cosmic rays ) to be valid .",
    "it follows that for the above assumptions , the left hand side @xmath432 .",
    "this , however , means that the bell instability does not occur , as seen from equation  ( [ a7 ] ) ; rather , the effect of the cosmic rays is to slightly decrease the phase velocity of stable alfvn waves .",
    "it follows that bell turbulence can not amplify the magnetic field to near equipartition with the cosmic ray pressure .",
    "some estimates in the literature use a cosmic ray density of @xmath433 @xmath434 .",
    "it would follow that @xmath435 .",
    "however , the problem here is that this value for the cosmic ray density includes low energy ( gev ) cosmic rays , which satisfy the assumption for small deflection only at extremely small spatial scales .",
    "it is doubtful that such modes should even be bell - unstable at all because of the @xmath436 damping term in the imaginary part of the frequency , as expressed by equation  ( [ a7 ] ) , which grows with @xmath232 faster than the growth term , and which should therefore dominate at small spatial scales .    as discussed in the introduction ,",
    "the factor @xmath27 is of the order of unity for the galaxy as a whole if all relativistic crs are included .",
    "the anisotropy @xmath23 is bounded by observations to be at most @xmath25 . finally , the term @xmath437 must be less than unity to satisfy the small cr deflection criterion that is the basis for the bell instability . altogether it follows that the quantity @xmath18 in equation  ( [ keyparameter ] ) , is less than unity in the galactic disk .",
    "this , however , implies bell stability by equation  ( [ a7 ] ) .",
    "so , whereas the standard @xmath375 mean - field dynamo @xcite and tangling the galactic magnetic field with cosmic ray streaming instabilities may be viable ways to amplify the galactic magnetic field , resonant cr streaming instabilities seem the more promising way to do it over large volumes , where @xmath27 is of the order of unity .",
    "resonant cr streaming instabilities produce alfvn modes of preferential circular polarization , just as the bell instability does , so the theoretical mechanisms for field amplification that are discussed in this paper apply to them as well .",
    "we conclude that dynamo activity in the galactic disk from the twisting of the field by collective cosmic ray interactions can take place in principle .",
    "the numbers seem marginal , so more careful investigation is needed to settle this point .      in intergalactic space ,",
    "the cosmic ray pressure is comparable to the magnetic pressure and there is then the chance that @xmath18 greatly exceeds unity . assuming that streaming instabilities keep the streaming velocity below the alfvn velocity @xmath31 , we can replace @xmath10 with @xmath31 , so in principle the field can be amplified to the point where the magnetic pressure @xmath438 is of the order of @xmath439 .",
    "we use the following parameters for plasma and cosmic ray particles : we assume @xmath440@xmath441 for the drift velocity of cosmic ray particles , @xmath442@xmath443 for the number density of cosmic rays particles , @xmath444@xmath445 for the mean number density of plasma ions , @xmath446 g for the equilibrium mean magnetic field , and @xmath447 cm for the turbulent length scale .",
    "the alfvn speed is @xmath448@xmath449 and the dimensionless @xmath18 parameter is @xmath450 which is comparable to the values studied in this paper .",
    "we have investigated the mean - field dynamo mechanisms in a turbulent plasma with a cosmic ray current .",
    "we find a linear growth stage , corresponding to the bell instability , and then a nonlinear stage corresponding to the production of a fully - developed mhd turbulence and generation of larger - scale magnetic field .    in the nonlinear stage , the level of mhd turbulence continues to grow ( see figs .",
    "[ pspec_compt2_tot ] and [ ppower_all_ek_em_t512eo4x_powerbz ] ) , and the correlation length increases with time ( see figure  [ ppower_kf_t512eo4x_powerbz ] ) .",
    "the turbulence develops a @xmath451 spectrum , despite the fact that the initial spectrum is @xmath452 .",
    "these effects were far from obvious , even given the stirring by the counter-@xmath453 forces on the fluid , which is the basis of the bell instability .",
    "we suggest that this combination of magnetic field amplification and large - scale ordering is due to the @xmath3 dynamo instability , in which the original field is stretched by unstable alfvn modes , and then the stretched component is itself stretched by unstable circularly polarized alfvn modes .",
    "this effect is to be contrasted with the long wavelength linear instability discussed by @xcite , because their growth rate vanishes when the perturbations are independent of @xmath79 .",
    "according to the simulations , the level of magnetic field on any scale can be enhanced by a factor of several within one expansion time , even at the largest scales , but there is no direct numerical evidence at present that it can be enhanced by much more than that .",
    "nevertheless , the analysis presented here predicts that much larger enhancement , via exponential growth to the @xmath0 effect , is possible .",
    "we have also used dns and the test - field method to confirm our analysis .",
    "dns shows that the instability has three stages . in the first stage ,",
    "the bell instability is excited ; in the intermediate stage the linear growth continues among the high @xmath232 modes , while mode coupling feeds the low @xmath232 , large - scale modes . in the third stage ,",
    "growth on large scale continues , apparently due to the @xmath3 dynamo .",
    "we find , as expected , that the value of @xmath0 , which has units of velocity , can never be much greater than the rms turbulent velocity , @xmath334 .",
    "the rms turbulent velocity , @xmath334 , by energy conservation , must be less than the shock velocity @xmath10 , probably much less .",
    "thus the maximum scale to which the @xmath3 dynamo can operate efficiently must be limited to @xmath454 of the radius of the blast wave @xmath382 ; because @xmath455 , there is not enough time in a single expansion time to stretch or move the field significantly over the characteristic expansion time @xmath456 of the blast wave .",
    "there is enough time only to greatly amplify the field on scales much smaller than @xmath382 .",
    "similar remarks would apply to accretion shocks , since material is swept out of the region of field amplification over a timescale of @xmath457 .    in blast waves from grbs , on the other hand ,",
    "this maximum scale of amplification , @xmath458 ( where @xmath459 is the scale of the cosmic ray precursor ) , could be much larger than the ion skin depth , so dynamo activity in the precursors of such blast waves could significantly increase the magnetic correlation length relative to what is produced by the weibel instability , so that the ohmic dissipation downstream would not be so devastating .",
    "the maximum energy to which cosmic rays can be accelerated by expanding supernova remnants , which is proportional to @xmath460 without magnetic field amplification , is not greatly enhanced by large - scale field amplification ( not , at least , in the parameter regime we have explored ) , since the increase in field strength comes at the cost of decreased correlation length @xmath344 , and the product @xmath461 is enhanced far less than @xmath362 .",
    "however , quantification of this point , made in greater detail by @xcite , would require a more extensive library of simulations , for all values of the ion current parameter @xmath18 that could conceivably occur in nature , and such simulations become very difficult for high @xmath18 .",
    "clearly if the pressure of initial field is sufficiently small relative to the cosmic ray pressure , then extremely large values of @xmath18 are possible , and the range @xmath462 has not been explored numerically . on the basis of extrapolation of the two values of @xmath18 ( @xmath338 or @xmath463 ) , for which we run high - resolution simulations , the @xmath6-folding timescale for field amplification @xmath464 over scale",
    "@xmath465 is approximately @xmath466^{-1}$ ] ; ( @xmath467 ) , while we expect on the basis of equation  ( [ keyparameter ] ) that the largest allowable value of @xmath18 , which occurs at @xmath468\\sim 1 $ ] , scales as @xmath469 .",
    "so the timescale for field amplification scales as @xmath470 .",
    "clearly this timescale can be made small enough for sufficiently weak fields and sufficiently small spatial scales ( i.e.  high @xmath232 ) .",
    "how field amplification at these scales and field strengths would ultimately affect the capability of shock acceleration remains an important question for future research .",
    "we have also considered the potential of this dynamo process in steady situations where newly created magnetic flux does not quickly sweep through the region where cosmic rays stream .",
    "an example of this could be the galaxy itself , with escaping cr providing a steady flux over the lifetime of the galaxy .",
    "if we assume that the crs that provide current for growth on scale @xmath20 must satisfy @xmath471\\le 1 $ ] , then , by equation  ( [ keyparameter ] ) , the condition that @xmath472 requires that @xmath473 ( where @xmath10 now stands for cr streaming velocity ) , so the dynamo can only bring the magnetic pressure to within a fraction @xmath23 of the cr pressure . on the other hand , this may be interesting , because it could  sprout \" a seed magnetic field to a sufficiently large amplitude that some other mechanism , such as the magnetorotational instability , could further raise the field pressure to its present value , @xmath474 .",
