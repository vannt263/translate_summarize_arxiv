    "dozens of ultra - faint dwarf galaxies have recently been discovered as satellites of the galaxy and andromeda , and as members of the local group ( @xcite and references therein ; @xcite ) .",
    "these satellites have luminosities as low as @xmath21000  @xmath4 , and total masses inside the half - light radius that are at least 13 orders of magnitude larger than their stellar masses ( @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "many of them host negligible amounts of gas ; all are understood to be dominated by their dark matter content .",
    "ultra - faint dwarf galaxies are excellent places to learn about dark matter .",
    "they currently provide the best constraints on annihilating weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , ruling out the simplest thermal relic cross - sections for particle masses of tens of gev @xcite .",
    "dwarf galaxies have also been a source of tension with cosmological simulations : cold dark matter simulations have long overpredicted the abundance of massive satellite galaxies @xcite .",
    "this problem may be resolved through a combination of newly discovered dwarfs and the inclusion of baryonic physics in simulations @xcite , but has also been suggested as evidence for exotic forms of dark matter or modified gravity @xcite .",
    "while the evidence for dark matter s existence is overwhelming @xcite , the identity of the dark matter particles remains mysterious .",
    "one intriguing possibility is that the dark matter consists of black holes formed in the early universe .",
    "such massive compact halo objects ( machos , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could be detected in the halo of our galaxy by gravitational microlensing @xcite .",
    "microlensing surveys , however , have now ruled out machos between @xmath210@xmath3 and @xmath230 @xmath1 as the dominant component of dark matter in our galaxy @xcite . at macho masses",
    "@xmath0100  @xmath1 , the existence of fragile , wide halo binaries constrains their abundance @xcite , though these limits rely heavily on just a few systems @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that one binary used by @xcite to claim constraints for machos @xmath020  @xmath1 is likely spurious , which removes the constraints for masses @xmath5200  @xmath1 .    at macho masses",
    "@xmath0100  @xmath1 , @xcite showed that some dwarf galaxy cores would be dynamically relaxed , in tension with the relatively constant - density cores that have been inferred @xcite .",
    "machos of very high mass ( @xmath010@xmath6  @xmath1 ) are also ruled out by the kinematics of the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "the only constraints on a population of machos between @xmath230  @xmath1 and @xmath2100  @xmath1 , however , currently come from limits on spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) : black holes may have accreted during the early universe , leaving an imprint on the cmb @xcite .",
    "however , other authors have argued that these constraints may not be definitive @xcite . @xcite",
    "have shown that machos of these masses may also be probed by lensed fast radio bursts ( frbs ) .    in this paper ,",
    "i derive macho constraints from the compact stellar distributions of ultra - faint dwarf galaxies and , in particular , from the survival of a star cluster in eridanus  ii .",
    "eridanus  ii was discovered as part of the dark energy survey @xcite .",
    "it has an absolute magnitude of @xmath7 and a half - light radius of almost 300  pc , and lies just beyond the galaxy s virial radius at a distance of @xmath8  kpc @xcite .",
    "eri  ii hosts a single star cluster of absolute magnitude @xmath9 ( @xmath22000  @xmath10 ) and half - light radius @xmath11  pc .",
    "the star cluster appears to be nearly coincident with the galaxy s center .",
    "several other ultra - faint dwarfs have stellar masses of a few thousand @xmath1 and half - light radii of @xmath230  pc @xcite ; these galaxies provide independent macho constraints .",
    "eri  ii is one of the few dwarf galaxies with a star cluster , but it is not unique in this respect . the fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy has long been known to host globular clusters @xcite .",
    "its five known globular clusters range from 240  pc to 1.6  kpc in projected separation from the galaxy center , and from @xmath2@xmath12@xmath13 to @xmath2@xmath14@xmath13 in mass @xcite .",
    "dynamical friction should cause these clusters to spiral in towards the center of fornax @xcite ; their current existence outside of its core places interesting constraints on the properties of fornax s dark halo @xcite .",
    "other dwarf galaxies do host nuclear star clusters @xcite ; these are invariably much more massive and more tightly bound than the cluster in eri  ii .    in this paper",
    "i show that the star cluster in eri  ii has important implications for macho dark matter , and that the population of compact ultra - faint dwarfs provides similar , independent limits .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : heating ] , i apply the theory of collisional stellar systems to dynamical heating of the cluster by machos . section [ sec : constraints ] presents the constraints on macho dark matter from the cluster in eri  ii and from the population of compact ultra - faint dwarfs .",
    "i discuss and conclude with section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "a star cluster is a dynamic environment where gravitational interactions lead to the exchange of energy between stars .",
    "these interactions cause the system to dynamically relax ; they may be approximated as diffusion terms using the fokker - planck equation @xcite .",
    "this approximation has enabled modeling of cluster density and velocity distributions ( @xcite and references therein ) . when a range of masses is present , stellar interactions lead to mass segregation , in which the most massive bodies have the most spatially compact distribution @xcite .",
    "two - body interactions tend to equalize the mean kinetic energies of different mass groups at a given location . in a system consisting of @xmath151  @xmath1 machos and stars",
    ", the stars will gain energy from the machos ; a compact stellar system will puff up .",
    "this can be treated as a diffusion problem , with weak scatterings gradually changing each star s velocity .",
    "the sum of the diffusion coefficients for the parallel and perpendicular components of the velocity describes the evolution of a star s kinetic energy . assuming an isotropic maxwellian velocity distribution for the dark matter particles and a locally uniform dark matter density , the relevant diffusion coefficient is given by @xmath16 = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2}\\pi g^2 f_{\\rm dm } \\rho m_a \\ln \\lambda}{\\sigma } \\left [ \\frac{{\\rm erf}(x)}{x } \\right ] , \\label{eq : diffusion_bt}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the coulomb logarithm , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the macho mass and velocity dispersion",
    ", @xmath20 is the total dark matter density , and @xmath21 is the fraction of dark matter in machos of mass @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the variable @xmath22 is the ratio of the stellar velocity to that of the machos , @xmath23 .",
    "i will assume that the stars are relatively cold compared to the dark matter , @xmath24 , which implies that @xmath25 .",
    "this assumption is satisfied for all of the cluster and dark matter parameters used in the following section . for the coulomb logarithm , @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath18 are the masses of the cluster stars and machos , respectively",

    "if dark matter is a mixture of machos and low - mass particles like wimps , dynamical heating will compete with dynamical cooling .",
    "the cooling rate from wimps is given by @xmath35 = vd[\\delta v_{|| } ] = -\\frac{4\\pi g^2\\rho v _ * m _ * ( 1 - f_{\\rm dm } ) \\ln \\lambda}{\\sigma^2}g(x),\\ ] ] with @xmath23 as before , @xmath36 being the mass of a typical star , and @xmath37.\\ ] ] dynamical heating will dominate over cooling by a factor @xmath38 or a factor of @xmath2100@xmath39 for 10  @xmath1 machos .",
    "equation is _ always _ much larger than unity for the limiting @xmath21 derived in the following section ; i neglect wimp cooling for the rest of this paper .",
    "heating by machos will add energy to the cluster , causing it to expand .",
    "if the cluster is embedded in a dark matter core of constant density @xmath20 , its potential energy per unit mass is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the cluster s stellar mass , @xmath30 is its projected half - mass radius , and @xmath42 and @xmath43 are proportionality constants that depend on the mass distribution . for a cored srsic profile , @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    "; i will adopt these values throughout the paper and assume them to remain constant as the cluster expands .",
    "the measured profile of the cluster in the dwarf galaxy eridanus  ii is a srsic profile with @xmath46 @xcite . performing the integrals using the python package ` sersic ` @xcite gives values of @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which would make this cluster expand slightly faster than with my fiducial @xmath42 and @xmath43 .    using the virial theorem , @xmath49 , equations and",
    "combine to give an implicit equation for the evolution of the half - light radius , @xmath50 as long as the star cluster is dark - matter dominated , equation is independent of the dark matter density .",
    "a compact stellar system will expand slowly until it becomes dominated by its dark matter content , and then expand with @xmath51 .",

    "the cluster expands slowly until its mean density equals that of the machos , and then expands as @xmath51 . ]",
    "motivated by equation , i define two characteristic lifetimes for a stellar system .",
    "the first is the time for it to puff up to its observed size from the @xmath22  pc core radius of a typical galactic star cluster ( * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* edition ) .",
    "the second is the timescale to double in area ( increase by a factor of @xmath54 in linear size ) . in the limit of a dark - matter dominated system ,",
    "these timescales are equal to each other , and to the timescale for the cluster to gain energy equal to its current kinetic energy .",
    "i now combine equation with the observed survival of compact ultra - faint dwarf galaxies and of the star cluster in the core of eridanus  ii to constrain macho dark matter . as described in the previous section ,",
    "i define two characteristic lifetimes : ( 1 ) the time for the cluster to expand to its current size from the @xmath22  pc core of a typical galactic cluster ; and ( 2 ) the time to double its current area . by requiring these times ,",
    "derived using equation , to be longer than the cluster s age , i derive corresponding constraints on the abundance of macho dark matter .",
    "the star cluster in eridanus  ii is believed to be at least @xmath23  gyr old , and could be as old as @xmath212  gyr @xcite . at an age of 3  gyr ,",
    "the @xmath55-band mass - to - light ratio for a metal - poor stellar system is @xmath21  @xmath56 , while this ratio is @xmath23  @xmath56 for an old system @xcite .",
    "the cluster s observed @xmath57 thus implies a stellar mass of @xmath22000  @xmath1 at an age of 3  gyr , or a mass of @xmath26000  @xmath1 at an age of 12  gyr .",
    "the system has an observed half - light radius @xmath11  pc .",
    "i assume the system to have resided within the core of the dark matter halo for its entire life , and derive macho limits by requiring the timescales for dynamical heating to be longer than the cluster s age .",
    "figure [ fig : macho_constraints ] shows the constraints for a range of plausible dark matter halo properties , with three - dimensional velocity dispersions of 510  kms@xmath32 and dark matter densities of 0.021  @xmath1pc@xmath58 .",
    "these values span the range of parameters characteristic of ultra - faint dwarf galaxies ( @xcite and references therein ) . at an age of 3  gyr ( left panel ) , machos @xmath515  @xmath1",
    "are excluded from making up all of the dark matter unless the eri  ii cluster was initially compact and remains embedded in a low - density , high - dispersion halo . in this case",
    ", a cluster of the observed size is a transient phenomenon ; similar objects should be rarer than compact low - mass clusters .",
    "if the cluster has spent @xmath212  gyr near the center of its halo ( right panel ) , the constraints strengthen .",
    "the preceding discussion assumed a roughly constant dark matter density profile ( a core larger than the cluster ) . assuming a cuspy dark matter profile with the cluster at the dynamical center would strengthen the conclusions",
    "such an assumption would make the cluster dominated by dark matter at a smaller half - light radius ; it would quickly begin to evolve with @xmath51 independently of dark matter density ( equation ) .",
    "further , the velocity dispersion of the dark matter particles is expected to fall toward the center of an nfw halo @xcite .",
    "lower velocity dispersions would make machos even more effective at dynamical heating , improving constraints on their abundance .",
    "if , on the other hand , the cluster were slightly offset from the dynamical center of a strong dark matter cusp , it would be tidally shredded in a dynamical time .",
    "the entire stellar population of a dwarf galaxy will also be dynamically heated by machos .",
    "many compact ultra - faint dwarf galaxies are now known , with stellar masses @xmath53000  @xmath1 ( assuming a mass - to - light ratio @xmath59  @xmath60 ) , half - light radii @xmath530  pc , and central densities @xmath21  @xmath1pc@xmath58 . table [ tab : ufdwarfs ] lists some basic properties of ten compact ultra - faint dwarfs ( plus the star cluster in eri  ii ) ; all but three were discovered since 2015 . where measured ,",
    "the ages of the stars are consistent with @xmath210  gyr @xcite .",
    "the mean densities listed are vulnerable to different definitions of the half - light or half - mass radius , and should be treated as uncertain to at least a factor of @xmath22 .",
    "the compact ultra - faint dwarfs constrain macho dark matter in the same way as the star cluster in eri  ii : i use the same two heating timescales and require one or the other to be longer than 10  gyr .",

    "while eri  ii s cluster likely provides the best limits on machos from @xmath210  @xmath1 up to thousands of @xmath1 , there are ways to evade its constraints .",
    "the cluster , for example , could have recently spiraled into the center of eri  ii due to dynamical friction , having spent most of its life as a compact cluster in a low - density macho environment . however , the inspiral timescale is inversely proportional to the cluster mass @xcite , and the cluster in eri ii is 1.52 orders of magnitude less massive than fornax 4 @xcite , the fornax globular cluster nearest the center of that dwarf ( at 240  pc in projected separation ) .",

    "such a black hole would have a mass comparable to the total stellar mass of its host galaxy .",
