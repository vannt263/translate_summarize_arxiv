    "ferromagnet - superconductor hybrid systems are currently subject to intense research activity , as they were conjectured to host triplet superconductivity induced by the proximity effect@xcite .",

    "so far , the main experimental prove of such triplet correlations is based on the josephson effect and on phase coherent electron transport in proximity structures @xcite .",
    "after two first confirmations of long - range triplet amplitudes in 2006 , @xcite an impressive series of affirmative experimental results was published in 2010.@xcite the systems under investigation varied largely in terms of materials and fabrication , the common idea being that a breaking of spin - rotation symmetry around the bulk magnetization axis must somehow be enforced at the superconductor ( sc)-ferromagnet ( fm ) contacts - which is in line with the general theoretical concepts behind this effect@xcite . in this article",
    ", we elaborate on our earlier work concerning long - range triplet supercurrents@xcite , where we used a recent extension of the quasiclassical green function technique@xcite , that allows us to consider ferromagnets whose exchange splitting @xmath2 is of the same order of magnitude as the fermi energy @xmath3 consistently within quasiclassical theory@xcite . in the following",
    "we include additional relevant effects like the suppression of the superconducting energy gap in proximity to the interfaces , the induced magnetization in the superconductor close to the ferromagnet , and disorder in the fm bulk .",
    "these calculations are performed numerically and cover all ranges of junction length , interface transparency , and impurity scattering . in the appendix , we provide detailed discussions of the intricacies involved in solving the self - consistency equation in quasiclassical theory with spin - active boundary conditions .",
    "in particular , we point out a previously not discussed technical problem with the self consistent solution of the order parameter that arises for quasiclassical transport equations with boundary conditions where the quasiclassical propagator undergoes a jump discontinuity during reflection from the interface .    with regard to the inverse proximity effect , we show that while the suppression of the gap function in the sc - electrodes is indeed substantial for highly transparent junctions , this does not imply that higher harmonic contributions to the current - phase relation ( cpr ) are necessarily suppressed . as expected , impurity scattering reduces the josephson current and in particular higher harmonic contributions to the cpr .",
    "we also find that there may be a reversal of the josephson spin - current as a function of temperature if impurity scattering is sufficiently strong .",

    "the fermi - velocities , however , are different and hence @xmath80 .",
    "this argument can also be made quantitative by noting that the impurity self energy in born approximation is proportional to @xmath81 , with impurity concentration @xmath82 , impurity scattering potential @xmath83 , and density of states at the fermi level @xmath24 .",

    "the discontinuity of the quasiclassical propagator in turn results from the fact that the microscopic reflection process at the interface falls outside the range of applicability of qc theory . to remedy this issue",
    ", we introduce a length cut - off @xmath91 and calculate the gap - equation only for distances larger than @xmath92 from the interface .",
    "we show that if the cut - off length is chosen small enough , neither its precise value nor the profile of the sc - gap for distances smaller than @xmath92 influences the results .",
    "we choose for our numerical calculations @xmath93 .",
    "we found that a very stable way of solving the riccati differential equations for spin - polarized systems is to resort to analytical solutions for constant self - energies .",
    "i.e. , instead of using a standard solver for ordinary differential equations along each trajectory , we approximate the self - energies by a constant in each interval that corresponds to the grid - spacing of our discretization in the @xmath62-direction , and use the analytical solution for homogeneous self - energies @xcite : @xmath94\\big\\{e^{i\\rho\\omega_2}+c(\\rho)\\cdot[\\gamma_0-\\gamma_h]\\big\\}^{-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath95 is the homogeneous bulk solution , @xmath96 is the initial value and @xmath97 parameterizes the respective trajectory as @xmath98 .",

    "we then integrate the transport equations and solve the boundary conditions at the interfaces to update all coherence functions and calculate the initial values for the next step of the iteration .",
    "subsequently , all self - energies are updated by evaluating the respective self - consistent equation with the new coherence functions .",
    "the initial values at the outer boundaries are always assumed to be the respective sc bulk - solution .",
    "the order - parameter phase difference @xmath110 enters via these boundary values . at the initial step ,",
    "we chose the coherence functions and the impurity potential inside the fm to be zero and the sc gap to be constant up to the interface .",
    "the normal - state scattering matrices entering the quasiclassical boundary conditions can not be obtained within qc theory itself .",
    "we calculate them from plane wave matching in the normal - state using a simple model for the interface scattering potential that captures all relevant effects .",
    "the interface hamiltonian reads : @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the interface exchange field , and : @xmath113 @xmath114 plays the role of a spin - independent interface potential .",
    "accordingly , the normal - state hamiltonians of the ferromagnet and the superconductor read : @xmath115 obviously , @xmath116 is invariant under rotations in spin - space , while both @xmath117 and @xmath118 break spin - rotation symmetry .",

    "the unitary matrix @xmath125 , which maps the spin - eigenbasis of the interface to that of the ferromagnet , reads : @xmath126    the scattering matrix is obtained by diagonalizing the hamiltonians and inferring the respective values of @xmath127 at the fermi - level for a given @xmath69 .",
    "the corresponding wave - functions in the three layers are then matched at the sc / i and the i / fm interface respectively , choosing a spin - quantization axis in the sc aligned with that of the interface , while at the i / fm interface , the rotation @xmath128 must be taken into account .",
    "the requirement that @xmath69 must be conserved across the interface implies that even if the ferromagnet is not fully spin - polarized , some trajectories will have an evanescent solution in the minority band of the fm , corresponding to the half - metallic case . in the case",

    "the reason why the spin - mixing effect plays a minor role here , is that under the assumption of a box shaped scattering potential the magnitude of the interface spin - mixing parameters that are responsible for creating triplet - pair correlations are typically small ( see our extensive discussion of this effect in ref .  )",
    "this can be seen in the top right panel , where the absolute value of the induced magnetization is shown .",
    "the transparency is largely irrelevant here , as the inverse proximity effect is due to spin - active back - scattering from the superconducting side , i.e. a property of the spin - dependent scattering phases in the reflection parts of the scattering matrix .",

    "we assume that at the beginning of the iteration step , the incoming solutions at all interfaces and the self - energies are known from the previous step .",
    "the procedure works as follows :    1 .   solve the boundary conditions at all interfaces .",
    "2 .   integrate all outgoing coherence functions up to the next interface or outer boundary .",
    "3 .   update all self - energies .",
    "we use the secant method to accelerate convergence .",
    "4 .   update all incoming coherence functions .",
    "we use two abortion criteria , since the iteration in the scs may converge a lot faster than in the central fm layer if the transparency of the interfaces is small .",
    "if the gap - profile is well - converged , the iteration in the sc is stopped and continues only inside the fm .      generally ,",
    "technical energy cut - offs that appear in expressions for self - energies or observables in quasiclassical theory must be eliminated in favor of phenomenological parameters .",
    "this is usually achieved by adding and subtracting terms in matsubara sums or energy integrals that cancel the divergent behavior of these expressions and allow to formally extend the sum or integral to infinity @xcite .",
    "the other half of such an `` added zero '' can typically be included in a phenomenological ( measurable ) parameter .",
    "while this procedure is standard for the weak - coupling gap equation in quasiclassical theory , it turns out to be problematic at interfaces .",
    "we are not aware of any discussion of this subtle issue in the literature before .",
    "we here discuss a method for dealing with this issue .",
    "we start from the self - consistency equation : @xmath196 in what follows , we limit the discussion to singlet , s - wave superconductivity , i.e. @xmath197 , but the argumentation can easily be generalized .",
    "the interaction constant can be eliminated by linearizing the above equation close to @xmath89 ( @xmath198 ) .",
    "since the interaction constant is a bulk - property , it is justified to consider the homogeneous bulk case , i.e. : @xmath199 this equation also shows why a technical cut - off @xmath200 must be included in , as the matsubara sum diverges .",
    "this problem does not arise in the microscopic theory , where the asymptotic behavior of @xmath201 is given by @xmath202.@xcite the linearized equation reads : @xmath203 given that @xmath204 , we then obtain the well - known standard result in terms of the digamma - function @xmath205 , @xmath206 at this point , one can see that keeping a technical cut - off is , at least in the matsubara case , not tenable .",
    "@xmath207 should of course be an integer number .",
    "obviously one can choose @xmath208 so that @xmath207 is integer here , but @xmath208 must be the same for all temperatures and since the spacing of matsubara frequencies is temperature dependent , it will generally not be commensurate with @xmath208 .",
    "one can verify numerically that if such a cut - off is kept in @xmath209 , the gap - profile one finds is the bcs - relation with a jigsaw - pattern superimposed to it , which vanishes as @xmath210 . the standard way of dealing with this problem is to regularize the matsubara sum .",
    "this is achieved by subtracting the asymptotic form of @xmath211 on both sides of : @xmath212 both sides of this equation can now be regularized , if the expression for @xmath213 is taken into account .",
    "the cut - off can be taken to infinity , which yields @xmath214 for the boundary value problem one may object that the counter term was adapted to the homogeneous bulk - case , but expanding the solution of the riccati - equations in orders of @xmath215 , one finds @xcite : @xmath216 and therefore : @xmath217 thus , even if the gap - profile is inhomogeneous , the asymptotic behavior remains the same as long as the gap is a smoothly varying function .",
    "up to this point , the procedure is well - known and established .",
    "a problem does , however , arise at interfaces where the boundary conditions leads to a discontinuous behavior of the coherence functions under reflection . to see this",
    ", we consider the coherence function to leading order in @xmath215 .",
    "the incoming coherence function at the interface is then given by @xmath218 .",
    "to illustrate the point we here assume that the solution of the boundary conditions at the interface is : @xmath219 where @xmath220 denotes the reflection matrix on the sc - side of the interface .",
    "this is not fully generic , since we assume that the transmission from the other side of the interface can be neglected .",
    "however , for the case we consider here this is reasonable as the coherence functions on the fm side are exponentially suppressed by propagation through the fm layer and can thus be neglected at high energies .",
    "now it is easy to see that the asymptotic behavior of @xmath221 at the interface is given by : @xmath222 here @xmath223 denotes an fs - average over trajectories pointing towards / away from the interface .",
    "it is obvious that this @xmath211-function will only have the required asymptotic behavior if @xmath224 or @xmath225 .",
    "this implies that the right - hand side of equation will diverge if that is not the case .",
    "adapting the cancellation term will not help either , since the coupling constant @xmath213 is fixed by the bulk - behavior , which implies that the left - hand side of would diverge in that case .",
    "so eventually , one arrives at the conclusion that the only consistent solution for @xmath226 is @xmath227 .",
    "the problem here is the discontinuous jump of the @xmath211-function upon reflection at the interface , which is directly related to the fact that the interface region can not be described within quasiclassical theory . while the use of effective boundary conditions is sufficient to circumvent this problem if the self - consistency relation is neglected , one must go a step further if it is retained .",
    "our solution to this problem is to assume that the self - consistency equation must not be calculated if the distance to the interface is smaller than a length cut - off @xmath228 . to see how this resolves our issue",
    ", we have to calculate @xmath229 and @xmath230 . here",
    ", @xmath229 is the incoming coherence function and obtained by integrating the riccati equation from some initial value inside the bulk .",
    "since the gap - profile is smooth for @xmath231 , this implies that it does have the correct asymptotic behavior at high energies .",
    "@xmath230 originates from the interface .",
    "if we assume that the gap has a constant value @xmath232 in some environment @xmath233 $ ] of @xmath92 , where @xmath30 can be arbitrarily small , the solution for @xmath230 will be given by @xcite @xmath234\\big\\{e^{i\\eta\\omega_2}+c(\\rho)\\cdot[\\gamma_0-\\gamma_{h , c}]\\big\\}^{-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath235 and @xmath236 .",
    "this solution has the correct asymptotic behavior , irrespective of how the gap - profile varies for @xmath237 , as it is given by the homogeneous solution @xmath238 at sufficiently high energies .",
    "we found that the sum in must be , however , calculated up to very high energies , since @xmath92 should be very short .",
    "thus , we need to discuss high - energy contributions next .      to numerically compute , we consider two numerical energy cut - offs on the right - hand side : @xmath239 up to @xmath240 we calculate the full coherence functions in the whole structure without any approximations .",
    "the high - energy contribution is only calculated in the sc - electrodes . to efficiently calculate this contribution",
    ", we consider the linearized riccati - equation : @xmath241 which is easily solved exactly by a variation of constants : @xmath242\\beta(\\rho),\\ \\beta=\\exp[-2\\epsilon_n\\rho ] , \\\\c(\\rho)&=\\int_0^\\rho d\\rho ' \\frac{i\\delta(\\rho')}{\\beta(\\rho')}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] again assuming that the gap - profile is constant , this yields : @xmath243\\beta(\\rho).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we also assume that the boundary conditions reduce to .",
    "it is easy to convince oneself that the linearized riccati - equation is exact up to second order in @xmath215 .",
    "up to second order , we also have : @xmath244 from which we calculate the contribution to the gap function .",
    "as discussed above , the need for taking into account this high - energy correction factor arises from interface scattering .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that it vanishes rapidly inside the sc - bulk .",
    "this fortunately implies that we must only calculate it very close to the interface .      for @xmath245 ,",
    "we have @xmath246 the zero - temperature green function is thus obtained by replacing @xmath247 and all matsubara sums must be replaced with the above integral .",
    "care must be taken in regard to the normalization factor in the self - consistency equation : @xmath248 with @xmath249 $ ] , since both terms in this sum become infinite . for @xmath245 ,",
    "the second term approaches @xmath250-\\psi(1/2)$ ] , and we have : @xmath251",
    "first , we need the wave - vectors which are obtained from solving the one - dimensional schrdinger - equation for given @xmath252 , @xmath253 . these are @xmath254 and @xmath255 for @xmath117 , @xmath191 for @xmath116 , and @xmath256 and @xmath257 for @xmath118 , where @xmath257 is associated to the evanescent mode .",
    "these wave - vectors @xmath258 may be real or imaginary , corresponding to either a conducting or an insulating interface .",
