    "the feshbach s theory of the optical potential  @xcite provides a tool to describe the scattering of nucleons from nuclei . in its original form",
    ", the full hilbert space is partitioned in a subspace that contains only one particle added to a particular state of the core nucleus .",
    "this includes the elastic scattering states and the nuclear orbits unoccupied by the target s nucleons .",
    "the resulting optical potential can be thought as an effective interaction that accounts for the effects of the degrees of freedom of the excluded space such as the overall antisymmetrization of the wave function , excitations of the target or breakup channels .",
    "the complexity of these effects makes the _ ab initio _ calculation of the optical potential a very difficult task .",
    "the choice of working in the space of one particle plus a core is shared by several theories of nucleon - nucleus scattering .",
    "examples are the cluster model  @xcite , folding potential  @xcite and shell model embedded in the continuum  @xcite .",
    "all these techniques have been successfully applied to scattering processes .",
    "a conceptually different approach consists in extending the scattering space to include both a particle on top of the nuclear core and the possibility of propagating a hole excitation . in the following",
    ", we will refer to this as the particle - hole ( _ ph _ ) hilbert space .",
    "mahaux and capuzzi  @xcite and jennings and escher  @xcite have shown that applying the feshbach s formalism to this space leads to an optical potential that is the usual many - body self - energy defined in green s function theory  @xcite .",
    "the properties of using the self - energy as an optical potential have been discussed by mahaux and sartor in ref .",
    "the solutions of the scattering equation above ( below ) the fermi energy are the overlap wave functions between the core and the eigenfunctions of the systems with @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) nucleons . for particle states these are the same wave functions as obtained in the original feshbach approach  @xcite .",
    "the fact that states with @xmath2 particle are included in the formalism does not lead to complications in the study of scattering events .",
    "rather , more physical information can be extracted using the self - energy since it also describes the so called ` pauli forbidden ' orbitals , occupied by the nucleons of the target .",
    "correspondingly , the optical potential in the _ ph _ space is more easily comparable to phenomenological models ( based on , e.g. , wood - saxon wells )  @xcite since these also describe hole states .",
    "it also has better analytical properties than its counterpart in the particle - only space  @xcite .",
    "finally , the theory of green s functions provides a natural way to include the effects of the excitations of the core in terms of an expansion in feynman diagrams  @xcite .",
    "many - body green s functions have been applied in the past to study nuclear correlations , with emphasis on the hole part of the one - body spectral function .",
    "recent developments offer the opportunity to obtain sophisticate descriptions of the couplings between particles and collective states using a faddeev expansion  @xcite .",

    "it is important to investigate whether the green s function approach can be applied to study low - energy nucleon scattering and capture processes .",
    "we have recently considered the self - energy resulting from a recent application of the self - consistent green s function ( scgf ) method to @xmath0o  @xcite and explored its predictions for proton - nucleus scattering .",
