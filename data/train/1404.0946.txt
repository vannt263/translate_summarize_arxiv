    "in cosmology , the scalar fields play an important role due to its broad phenomenology , which can be used in order to describe different phenomena . for that reason",
    "they have been used to model phenomena like inflation @xcite , dark energy @xcite , dark matter @xcite , bounce scenarios @xcite , and unification models @xcite .",
    "the canonical lagrangian for a scalar field is given by @xmath1 , where the first term @xmath2 is the kinetic term , and the second is the potential that can have different functional forms depending on the model . in the last years , a generalization has been a studied in which the lagrangian is a general function of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "these lagrangians were used initially in the study of inflation @xcite and dark energy @xcite , and in a previous work we used this type of lagrangian to unify inflation , dark matter , and dark energy @xcite .",
    "one particular form of this kind of lagrangian is the sum - separable , in which @xmath5 and there is a clear separation between the kinetic term @xmath6 and the potential term @xmath7 .",
    "this class of lagrangians has the advantage of being more easily studied than the more general case while still conserving some of the rich phenomenology that is not present in the canonical case . in a previous work we studied the dynamical system of this class of lagrangians in a flat friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) cosmology filled with the field and an additional barotropic fluid @xcite .",
    "this analysis allowed us to find the critical points of the system and its stability , from which we drew conclusions about the general behaviour and evolution of the system .    in the present work we will review this analysis and we will add an extra analysis for the case in which the system has non - trivial critical points . we will show that in that case there is a symmetry that allows the degrees of freedom of the system to reduce .",
    "this behaviour is similar to what happens in the canonical lagrangian with exponential potential .",
    "this symmetry allows the existence of scaling solutions even when the lagrangian is not of the form @xmath8 , which in the literature @xcite is considered to be the most general form of lagrangians with this behaviour .",
    "along this work we will consider a flat flrw cosmology filled with a scalar field with lagrangian of the form ( [ lag ] ) and a barotropic fluid with equation of state @xmath9 where @xmath10 is constant . in this system ,",
    "if no interaction between the field and the fluid is considered , the equations of motion correspond to the two independent einstein equations , also called friedmann equations and the two continuity equations as follows : @xmath11 \\ , ,     \\\\ & & \\label{fried2 }     \\frac{dh}{dt } = - \\frac{1}{2{m_{\\rm{pl}}}^2 } [ 2xf_x   + \\gamma_m \\rho_m ] \\ , ,     \\\\ & & \\frac{d\\rho_m}{dt } = - 3h\\gamma_m \\rho_m \\ , ,     \\\\",

    "here only three of the equations are independent from each other , as the system has only three degrees of freedom .",
    "we can choose an initial @xmath4 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , which in turn will define the initial hubble parameter with the equation ( [ fried1 ] ) and the initial kinetic term @xmath3 with the relation @xmath16    in order to obtain an autonomous system of differential equations we define as independent variable the dimensionless @xmath17 , and then define the new dynamical variables @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the density associated to the kinetic part of the lagrangian , and @xmath20 is the critical density for a flrw cosmology .",
    "the evolution equation ( [ fried1 ] ) is written in terms of the new defined dynamical variables as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is positive , which implies that both variables @xmath23 and @xmath24 are bounded between 0 and 1 .    using the previous relation and the evolution equations ( [ fried1]-[cont ] ) , we find the autonomous differential equations in terms of the dynamical variables as @xmath25 \\ , ,     \\\\",

    "these equations in general will depend on higher derivatives of the lagrangian terms which in turn will have evolution equations .    in order to cut the succession of equations it is possible to demand the lagrangian to satisfy that both @xmath27 and @xmath28 be constant , which implies that @xmath29 and @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are constants . in this case",
