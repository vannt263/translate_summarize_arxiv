    "just like the quark system , it has been shown from the atmospheric neutrino experiments @xcite and the solar neutrino experiments @xcite that neutrinos have finite mass and finite mixing .",
    "in this situation , it is extremely interesting to investigate the cp phase in the lepton sector .",
    "fortunately , recent report from sno experiment @xcite favors the lma msw solutions to the solar neutrino problem .",
    "this means that the measurements of cp phase may be possible because of the large 1 - 2 mixing angle and the large 1 - 2 mass difference .    in order to measure the cp phase ,",
    "the long - baseline experiments such as the jhf experiment @xcite and the neutrino factory experiments @xcite are planned . in the past , the asymmetries @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    "have been considered as the main approach to measure the cp phase @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "these are methods to measure the direct cp violation term which depends on @xmath5 .",
    "however , the measurement of @xmath6 is not directly related to the discovery of cp phase , because of fake cp violating effects from the earth matter .",
    "@xmath7 is a pure t violating observable , but it has its own experimental difficulties .",
    "so , alternative approach has been recently considered in @xcite .",
    "this is an attempt to obtain the information on the cp phase totally from the probabilities itself , not only the direct cp violation term but also the indirect cp violation term which depends on @xmath8 . in these papers",
    "the oscillation probability is written approximately in the form , @xmath9 .",
    "the extra information which is proportional to @xmath8 will lead us to the value of @xmath4 in spite of the matter effect . in order to obtain more precise information , it is highly desirable to have an exact expression for @xmath0 . some attempts to derive the exact formula",
    "have been made in the context of three neutrino scenarios @xcite .",
    "these formulae are useful for numerical calculation .",
    "however , the precise cp dependence of @xmath0 has not been investigated sufficiently @xcite .    to describe our approach ,",
    "let us review the work of naumov @xcite and harrison - scott @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath10 in matter is related to @xmath11 in vacuum as @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 is fermi constant and @xmath15 is the electron density in matter . in particular , taking the products of non - diagonal elements , @xmath16 one obtains the following identity , which we call naumov - harrison - scott identity , @xmath17 in cp - odd part , where @xmath18 , @xmath19 is jarlskog factor @xcite , @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the maki - nakagawa - sakata ( mns ) matrix @xcite . here",
    "the quantities expressed by the tilde include the matter effects . from this identity ,",
    "@xmath22 can be expressed in terms of effective masses and the parameters of the hamiltonian in vacuum . as effective masses shown in @xcite",
    "do not depend on the cp phase , @xmath22 can be completely expressed by the linear term in @xmath5 .",
    "the reason why the cp dependence becomes simple is that @xmath22 is the products of four @xmath23 s .",
    "complicated matter effects included in a @xmath23 are partially canceled in @xmath22 .",
    "is performed by diagonalizing @xmath10 in ref .",
    "]    in this letter , we calculate @xmath24 .",
    "we use some matter invariant identities such as naumov - harrison - scott identity and express not only @xmath22 but also @xmath25 with the effective masses and the parameters in vacuum .",
    "the exact formula obtained in this method is very simple and the matter effects come in only through effective masses .",
    "we show that @xmath25 has only a linear term in @xmath8 .",
    "that is , we prove that the oscillation probability in matter can be written in the form @xmath26 without any approximation .",
    "another merit of our result is that the exact formula immediately reduces to the well - known approximate formulae both in low - energy @xcite and in high - energy @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that the approximate formula in high - energy can be easily reproduced from our exact formula as an example .",
    "finally , we numerically calculate the coefficients @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the flavor and mass eigenstates are related by the mns matrix @xmath30 in matter , where @xmath31 is the flavor index , @xmath32 is the mass index .",
    "the amplitude for @xmath33 to @xmath34 transition is given by @xmath35 and the oscillation probability is also given by @xmath36 from the amplitude , where @xmath37 stands for the baseline length .",
    "we note from ( [ 1 ] ) that the amplitude depends only on the products @xmath38 .",
    "one of the important points in this letter is that these products can be easily calculated from identities which we derive below .    from the unitarity relation and the other two relations , @xmath39 three identities on the products @xmath40",
    "can be obtained as follows : @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are constants determined by the parameters in vacuum and the sum is over @xmath44 .",
    "we use the relation @xmath45 etc , obtained from the formula @xmath46 , where @xmath47 represents the cofactor matrix .    solving the simultaneous equations for the products @xmath40",
    ", we obtain @xmath48 where @xmath49 takes @xmath50 . from the definition @xmath51 , the exact formula of the oscillation probability",
    "is given by @xmath52 where the sum is over @xmath53 and @xmath54 we find that the matter effects are confined in the effective masses only .",
    "we can obtain the probability for antineutrinos , @xmath55 , by exchanging @xmath56 and @xmath57 in @xmath58 and @xmath59 of eq .",
    "( [ 200 ] ) .",
    "let us comment on the relation between our result and that of other authors .",
    "the second identity ( [ 4 ] ) is also given in ref .",
    "@xcite . the third identity ( [ 5 ] )",
    "is new and play an important role in deriving our exact formula .",
    "the similar expression to ( [ 206 ] ) is given in ref .",
    "@xcite as the result of the calculation of @xmath60 , although the cp phase has not been considered . in (",
    "[ 206 ] ) is also derived from eq .",

    "naumov - harrison - scott identity is reproduced by substituting ( [ 205 ] ) into ( [ 7 ] ) .",
    "in this section , we give a concrete expression for the oscillation probability and then , we study the dependence of the oscillation probability on the cp phase .",
    "first let us consider the constants @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "we use the standard parametrization @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "in addition , as the neutrino oscillation probabilities do not depend on the mass itself , but the mass square differences , we take @xmath66 and @xmath67 without loss of generality .",
    "so , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are real numbers ; @xmath71 then , we have @xmath72 therefore , the oscillation probability can be written in the form @xmath73 from ( [ 200])-([7 ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath74 and @xmath29 are independent of @xmath4 and the oscillation probability is expressed only by the linear terms in @xmath8 and @xmath5 up to a constant as described below .",
    "this is one of our main results . here",
    "@xmath75 are expressed by the products of the oscillation part dependent on @xmath37 and @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",

    "our analytic result given in ( [ 8 ] ) should be compared with the result of @xcite depicted in fig .",
    "1 obtained numerically .",
    "the trajectory becomes an ellipse in the bi - probability space when @xmath4 changes from @xmath80 to @xmath81 .",
    "the cp dependence of the exact form of @xmath0 given in ( [ 8 ] ) becomes much simpler than the result in @xcite . by solving ( [ 8 ] ) for @xmath5 and",
    "@xmath8 one obtain @xmath82 thus , we can determine the value of cp phase except for the ambiguity of the sign from the measurement of the probability .",
    "the sign ambiguity is understood as follows .",
    "if we measure the probability of the neutrino at a fixed energy and a baseline , we find the solutions on a  line a \" . as shown in fig .",
    "1 , there are two intersections x and y of  line a \" with the cp trajectory .",
    "this is the reason why the ambiguity due to the sign appears in the analytic solutions ( [ 201 ] ) and ( [ 202 ] ) .    in order to resolve the sign ambiguity",
    ", we need to measure more than two kinds of probabilities , for example , neutrino and antineutrino .",
    "we denote @xmath83 and @xmath84 of the oscillation probabilities for neutrino and antineutrino respectively as @xmath85 then , cp phase can be determined by @xmath86 without the ambiguity of the sign .",
    "this means that the solution is at x , the intersect of  line a \" and  line b \" .",
    "although the value of cp phase is determined , in principle , in ( [ 100 ] ) and ( [ 101 ] ) , there remain other ambiguities included in @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 .",
    "the methods to resolve these ambiguities are discussed in the references for example @xcite .",
    "we discuss the ambiguities due to the sign of mass squared differences in sec .",
    "in the previous section , we have shown that the exact formula of the oscillation probability can be expressed as @xmath90 . in this section ,",
    "we demonstrate that the approximate formula seen in @xcite is easily derived as an example in the case of @xmath91 .",

    "the sign of @xmath100 is determined from next leading terms @xmath27 or @xmath28 .",
    "this means that the sign of @xmath100 is simultaneously determined in addition to the cp phase .",

    "we have calculated @xmath24 from the identities without directly calculating single @xmath23 . not only the derivation but also the result becomes simple and the matter effects enter only through effective masses .",

    "it has been shown that the oscillation probability is in the form , @xmath141 .",
    "we have also demonstrated that the approximate formula in high - energy can be easily reproduced from our result .",
    "finally , let us comment on the oscillation probabilities for other channels .",
    "these probabilities are easily derived in the same way as @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath142 has the same cp dependence as @xmath0 .",
