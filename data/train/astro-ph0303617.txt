    "the discovery that seyfert 2 galaxies such as ngc  1068 can have reflected or polarized broad - line emission has led to a unified model in which apparent differences in the properties of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are interpreted in terms of viewing angle toward a similar intrinsic underlying structure ( antonucci 1993 ) . in this unification paradigm , an optically thick circumnuclear dusty torus absorbs a significant fraction of the optical / uv / x - ray luminosity of the active nucleus and reradiates this energy at infrared wavelengths .",
    "one of the challenges of the unified model has been to reconcile the observed infrared emission with that predicted from the absorbing torus .",
    "important observational constraints for the torus models come from the shape of the infrared spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and the silicate feature at @xmath10 .",
    "previous studies have shown that seyfert galaxies are stronger radiators in the mid - infrared than most non - seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , spinoglio et al . 1995 ; krabbe , bker , & maiolino 2001 ) and that their infrared continua have a range of shapes from nearly flat ( @xmath11 constant ) to steeply raising with increasing wavelengths in the region between 1 and @xmath12 .",
    "seyfert 2 galaxies generally have seds steeper than seyfert 1 galaxies ( e.g. , rieke 1978 ; edelson , malkan , & rieke 1987 ; ward et al .",
    "1987 ; fadda et al . 1998",
    "; alonso - herrero et al .",
    "torus models predict seds that are strongly dependent on the orientation of the torus with respect to the line of sight of the observer , as well as on the density distribution and geometry of the dusty absorbing material ( pier & krolik 1993 ; granato & danese 1994 ; efstathiou & rowan - robinson 1995 ; granato , danese , & franceschini 1997 ) .",
    "the emission between 1 and @xmath12 is thought to arise from hot dust ( up to @xmath13k ) ( e.g. , rieke & lebofsky 1981 ; barvainis 1987 ) in the inner part of the torus and hence hidden from sight in edge - on systems that appear to be of type 2 . to match the @xmath10 silicate feature , apparently often in absorption in seyfert 2 and not present or slightly in emission in seyfert 1 spectra ( rieke & low 1975a ; roche et al .",
    "1991 ; clavel et al .",
    "2000 ) , the tori are assumed to be optically thick even to far - infrared wavelengths .",
    "studies of agns have often focused on high luminosity objects ( qsos and bright seyfert 1s ) since in these objects the active nucleus dominates the emission of the host galaxy .",
    "these studies avoid the complications of interpretation when the host galaxy emission is a significant fraction of the total ( e.g. , kotilainen et al .",
    "1992 ; alonso - herrero , ward , & kotilainen 1996 ) . because modelling of seds is only available for a handful of relatively high - luminosity nearby agns ( e.g. , efstathiou , hough , & young 1995 ; alexander et al . 1999 ; ruiz et al .",
    "2001 ) , the torus parameters are not well constrained .",
    "the high angular resolution of the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) now allows us to probe the nuclei with a beam area about 30 times smaller than is typically achieved with ground - based observations at visible and near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "imagers in the mid - infrared also provide a significant improvement in angular resolution over previous studies .",
    "such data enable us to separate the nuclear emission from that of the surrounding galaxy with unprecedented accuracy as well as to probe for lower luminosity active nuclei .",
    "recent imaging from the infrared space observatory ( _ iso _ ) also allows us to measure the nuclear emission in the mid - infrared with improved sensitivity compared with previous observations .",
    "we have used these capabilities on an expanded version of the cfa sample of seyfert galaxies .",
    "the infrared seds of the cfa sample have been studied by edelson et al .",
    "( 1987 ) , pier & krolik ( 1993 ) , maiolino et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and prez garca & rodrguez espinosa ( 2001 ) .",
    "fadda et al .",
    "( 1998 ) compiled data from the literature and _ iras _ to produce infrared seds of a heterogeneous sample of seyfert galaxies , but they mainly focused their efforts on fitting infrared colors to their model outputs .",
    "all these works noted that the relatively large apertures used were likely to be contaminated by emission from the host galaxies , a particular problem for the seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "to address this concern , in this paper we present high resolution irtf @xmath14 ( @xmath15 m ) and @xmath16 ( @xmath17 m ) band imaging of the cfa seyfert galaxies , from which we have estimated the non - stellar nuclear fluxes .",
    "we combine these fluxes with measurements of the unresolved nuclear emission from optical _ hst_/wfpc1 and _ hst_/wfpc2 and near - infrared _ hst_/nicmos and mid - infrared measurements made from isocam images , and/or small - aperture ground - based @xmath18 m measurements from the literature .",
    "this suite of data is used to compare the properties of the non - stellar seds with the predictions of models for dusty tori .",
    "tables  1 and 2 ( see also section  2.2 ) list the sample of galaxies on which this paper is based .",
    "the galaxies are from the cfa redshift survey , which is drawn from the fraction of the sky defined either by @xmath19 and @xmath20 or @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "the agns were identified by means of optical spectroscopy , thus defining a `` complete '' magnitude - limited sample of 49 seyfert galaxies ( huchra & burg 1992 ) .",
    "because it is not color - selected , this sample should be relatively free of selection effects that tend to enhance the proportion of galaxies with anomalously strong emission in the color used for selection ( huchra & burg 1992 ; osterbrock & martel 1993 ) .",
    "spectroscopic classifications for the cfa survey are taken from osterbrock & martel ( 1993 ) and references therein .",
    "however ho , filippenko , & sargent ( 1997 ) identified 5 seyfert 2 galaxies as having lower seyfert types than listed by osterbrock & martel ( 1993 ) . in these cases we list in table  1 , column  2 the identification from osterbrock & martel ( 1993 ) on the left and that from ho et al .",
    "( 1997 ) on the right .",
    "ruiz , rieke , & schmidt ( 1994 ) detected broad components in near - infrared lines in mkn  334 and ngc  5252 ( hei at @xmath24 m ) and mkn  533/ngc  7674 ( hei and pa@xmath25 ) .",
    "optical polarized broad - line components were detected by young et al .",
    "( 1996 ) in ngc  4388 , ngc  5252 and mkn  533 .",
    "tran ( 2001 ) has found a hidden broad line region in ngc  7682 .",
    "for the seyfert 2s in table  1 we also indicate whether such hidden broad - line regions have been detected .",
    "the cfa sample is usually regarded as a complete sample of optically selected seyfert galaxies .",
    "however maiolino & rieke ( 1995 ) show that it is incomplete both in terms of low luminosity nuclei and edge - on galaxies .",
    "ho & ulvestad ( 2001 ) also discuss selection biases that may affect the completeness of cfa sample . because of the method used to identify agns in the cfa sample , only seyfert 2s having the broadest , most extended wings in the observed emission lines were included in the final sample .",
    "the distinction in the original classifications between liners and seyferts is also not rigorous .",
    "according to these authors the cfa sample is likely to be complete only for relatively bright objects , and the seyfert 2s in particular are intrinsically more luminous and more radio - powerful than is typical .    to alleviate in part the possible biases in the original cfa sample",
    ", we have defined an extended sample .",
    "it includes all the seyfert galaxies in the original cfa sample as well as those galaxies initially classified as liners by huchra & burg ( 1992 ) , but later reclassified as seyfert galaxies by ho et al .",
    "( 1997 ) from high s / n optical spectra .",
    "we therefore add a total of nine galaxies ( see table  2 ) to the original cfa sample , thus increasing its size by @xmath26 ( a total of 58 galaxies ) .",
    "our sample is still probably weighted against low - luminosity type 2 seyferts .",
    "table  3 compares the fractions of type 1 ( @xmath6 ) and type 2 ( @xmath27 ) , as classified from optical spectroscopy in a number of nearby agn samples : 1 . )",
    "the rsa sample ( see maiolino & rieke 1995 ) ; 2 . ) the palomar survey ( ho et al .",
    "1997 ) ; and 3 . ) the infrared - selected @xmath28 sample ( spinoglio & malkan 1989 ) . since the cfa sample shows a deficit of highly inclined galaxies ( see maiolino & rieke 1995 , and section  5.5 ) , in this table we make the same comparison for galaxies with axial ratios @xmath29 .",
    "galaxy inclinations are taken from ho et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and from the rc3 ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "we find that in low inclination galaxies , both the extended cfa sample and the @xmath28 sample have slightly smaller fractions of type 2s than the palomar and rsa samples , although the numbers are not different at a statistically significant level . if , as claimed by ho & ulvestad ( 2001 ) , the cfa sample only contains seyfert 2s with relatively bright broad emission lines , then the cfa sample would be biased against low luminosity type 2 agns rather than against pure type 2 objects ( that is , those with an equatorial or near equatorial view of the agn ) . and",
    "indeed , it appears from table  3 that the palomar survey has the highest fraction of type 2 objects , probably because the high quality of its spectra allows detection of very low luminosity objects .",
    "we have obtained high resolution @xmath14 ( @xmath30 m ) and @xmath16 band ( @xmath31 m ) imaging of 34 cfa seyfert galaxies using nsfcam ( rayner et al .",
    "1993 ; shure et al .",
    "1994 ) at the 3.8 m nasa irtf telescope on mauna kea .",
    "the observations were made in august 1999 , march 2000 , august 2000 and may 2001 .",
    "we used the 0.3/pixel plate scale .",
    "the nuclei of the galaxies were sufficiently bright that we were able to use the tip - tilt capability during the first three campaigns ( it was not available during the fourth campaign ) , thus improving the image quality .",
    "typical integration times were 300 seconds in the @xmath14 band and @xmath32 seconds ( depending on the galaxy brightness ) in the @xmath16 band . in figure  1",
    "we show three galaxies displaying extended emission in the @xmath16 band .",
    "the spatial resolution ( fwhm ) in the @xmath16 band as measured from the standard stars was @xmath33 .",
    "standard data reduction procedures were applied for the @xmath14 images and for bright sources in the @xmath16 band .",
    "because of the short individual exposures in the @xmath16 band ( to avoid saturation ) , a number of galaxies were not detected on individual exposures , and thus the images had to be shifted to a common position and coadded using the nominal telescope offsets ( blind offsets , see table  4 ) . in these cases",
    "the morphology and flux of the unresolved component can not be determined , and only the integrated flux can be measured .",
    "conditions were photometric during all runs except for one night during the august 2000 campaign . throughout the nights we obtained observations of standard stars from elias et al .",
    "( 1982 ) for photometric calibration .",
    "the typical rms scatter in these calibration observations is @xmath34mag in both @xmath14 and @xmath16 bands .",

    "hst_/nicmos images of the cfa sample were taken for 22 seyfert @xmath27 galaxies with the nic1 camera ( 0.043/pixel ) at @xmath36 ( f110w filter ) and @xmath37 ( f160w filter ) as part of proposal 7867 and are described by martini & pogge ( 1999 ) and martini et al .",
    "ngc  1068 was a guaranteed time target .",

    "iso_/isophot fluxes measured for the cfa seyferts by prez garca & rodrguez espinosa ( 2001 ) . in addition , we obtained ground - based small aperture @xmath43-band ( @xmath44 ) fluxes from the literature , both to compare with the lower resolution isocam observations , and to use for those galaxies where isocam data are not available .    in table  1 and table  2",
    "we summarize the available _ hst_/wfpc1 , wfpc2 and nicmos , irtf @xmath45 and _ iso _ and ground - based mid - infrared observations for the cfa seyfert galaxies , along with appropriate references when the data were taken from the literature .",
    "the contribution from the underlying galaxy can dominate the central emission in seyfert 2 galaxies , especially at wavelengths shorter than approximately @xmath46 m ( see e.g. , alonso - herrero , ward , & kotilainen 1996 ; alonso - herrero et al .",
    "2001 ) and can also be significant in seyfert 1 galaxies ( e.g. , kotilainen et al .",
    "it is therefore essential to eliminate the stellar contributions to isolate the non - stellar emission from the agn . since the data used in this work have been obtained with different instruments , the methods for obtaining the unresolved emission are slightly different , as we describe below .      in quillen",
    "et al . ( 2001 ) we estimated the flux from the unresolved component in the f160w filter ( @xmath37 ) by fitting the sum of a galaxy profile and the point spread function ( psf ) for a large number of seyfert galaxies . for the underlying galaxy the profiles were fitted by exponential and power laws convolved with the appropriate nicmos psf generated by tinytim ( krist et al .",
    "1998 ) . here",
    "we applied the same procedure for the nicmos nic1 f110w images ( @xmath36 ) and the wfpc2 optical images .",
    "in addition we obtained nuclear wfpc1 or wfpc2 fluxes for a number of galaxies from peng & ho ( 2001 ) , see tables  1 and 2 .",
    "these authors fitted a two dimensional model consisting of an analytical description for the bulge light plus an additional point source for the nucleus , convolved with an appropriate synthetic psf .",
    "their modeling for the unresolved component is thus similar to ours .",
    "we estimated the non - stellar fractions at @xmath14 and @xmath16 band by fitting the psf surface brightness profile to the nucleus of the galaxy , and assumed that the fitted psf integrated flux represents the unresolved component ( see alonso - herrero et al .",
    "1998 for more details ) .",
    "the fwhms of the psf in the k@xmath35 and @xmath16 band were measured from standard star observations and from stars present in the images ( only in @xmath14 ) .",
    "we also produced surface brightness profiles of the host galaxies to determine the amount of extended emission .    in table  4 , column  ( 2 ) gives the measured fwhm of the nuclear emission in the @xmath16 band , column  ( 6 ) is the fraction of unresolved emission in a 3-diameter aperture , and column  ( 7 ) is the nuclear morphology in the @xmath16 band .",
    "as can be seen from this table the fraction of unresolved emission in the @xmath16 band within a 3-diameter aperture varies from @xmath47 to @xmath48 , although in most cases is within @xmath49 .",
    "mcleod & rieke ( 1995 ) also obtained estimates of the unresolved fluxes in the @xmath50 band .",
    "we find that our estimates agree with theirs to within the photometric and fitting errors of both works .      in agns",
    "past @xmath51 we expect the contribution from the underlying old stellar population to the nuclear fluxes to be much reduced compared to that at shorter wavelengths",
    ". however if the nuclear stellar population is dominated by a starburst there may be contamination at wavelengths @xmath52 m .",
    "we note that recently krabbe et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and lira et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have obtained ground - based @xmath43 imaging of small samples of seyfert galaxies and found that the mid - infrared @xmath12 emission is dominated by a central unresolved source ; however , a low surface brightness extended component powered by star formation might not be apparent in such data .",
    "because of the relatively large _",
    "iso_/isocam aperture ( diameter of 18 , see clavel et al .",
    "2000 ) we need to determine whether the @xmath53 and @xmath54 _ iso _ fluxes are contaminated by circumnuclear star formation . to this end",
    "we compare 6 cm radio measurements through a large ( @xmath55 ) aperture with those through a small ( @xmath56 ) aperture .",
    "the radio measurements are taken from kukula et al .",
    "( 1995 ) for the small aperture and from rush , malkan , & edelson ( 1996 ) for the large aperture .",
    "the small aperture radio measurements of seyfert galaxies are most likely to originate in the agn whereas the large aperture fluxes will include contributions from both the agn and extended star formation .",
    "small 6 cm @xmath57 ratios are therefore a warning that there may be a significant level of circumnuclear star formation within the large aperture .",
    "in table  5 we list seyfert galaxies in the cfa sample with available _ iso _ fluxes and fractions of nuclear to 15  radio emission of @xmath58 . for comparison in this table we also list , when available , the @xmath12 ground - based-@xmath59 . ] to _ iso _ flux ratios , and whether there is evidence for extended emission in the @xmath16 band and _ iso _ images .",
    "the latter are from clavel et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and our own analysis of the images .",
    "we have also included in this table ngc  5929 and ngc  5940 as they appear to have extended mid - infrared emission from the comparison of the _ iso _ and ground - based @xmath12 fluxes .",
    "mkn  334 , mkn  841 and ngc  4051 have small @xmath57 ratios at 6 cm , but do not appear to be extended in either the _ iso _ or the @xmath16-band images , and have mid - infrared ground to _ iso _ ratios consistent with most of this emission stemming from a small region .",
    "ngc  4388 shows evidence for extended radio emission , but the _ iso _ images reveal the presence of a bright point source on top of an extended diffuse component , so it is likely that most of the _ iso _ fluxes are unresolved emission originating in the agn .",
    "ngc  1144 , ngc  3982 , ngc  5033 and mkn  266sw are cases where the _ iso _ mid - infrared fluxes may contain a significant contribution from circumnuclear star formation . in ngc  1144",
    "there are hii regions a few arcseconds sw of the nucleus ( see figure  1 and also hippelein 1989 ) . in ngc  3982",
    "there are hii regions within the 18  _ iso _ aperture ( gonzlez - delgado et al .",
    "1997 ) , whereas in ngc  5033 bright hii regions are present in the spiral arms to within 5  of the nucleus ( evans et al .",
    "mkn  266sw is part of an interacting system whose nuclei are separated by @xmath60 . since we detect @xmath16-band emission from both nuclei ( see table  4 ) it is possible that the _ iso _ fluxes also contain contributions from both nuclei . for these galaxies we list in table  6 small aperture ground - based mid - infrared fluxes . if these are not available then the _ iso _ fluxes are given as upper limits to the unresolved emission .",
    "although there may still be some contribution from a compact starburst even for the small aperture ground - based measurements , it will be energetically less important than that from extended star formation ( imanishi 2002 ) .",

    "a common parametrization to describe the non - stellar seds of agn is to fit a spectral index ( @xmath70 ) so that the observed fluxes can be expressed as power laws , @xmath71 . for a significant fraction of the seyfert 2s we only have upper limits to the unresolved emission  at short wavelengths if a point source was not detected , and at longer wavelengths if there is evidence for stellar emission .",

    ", we must consider the effects of dust in the host galaxy .",
    "most of the seyfert galaxies in the cfa sample have dust near their nuclei ( martini & pogge 1999 ; pogge & martini 2002 ) .",
    "generally the extinction is not strong enough to be prominent in the nicmos images ( see martini & pogge 1999 ) , which sets a limit on the total extinction that can be present on scales resolvable by _ hst_. as can be seen from their color maps , the dust is generally located in front of the nucleus ( see also regan & mulchaey 1999 ) .",
    "we can therefore consider it as a purely foreground medium .",
    "martini & pogge ( 1999 ) used the @xmath74 colors of the seyfert 2s in the cfa sample to derive moderate levels of optical extinction , up to @xmath75mag .    to illustrate the effects of dust in the host galaxy",

    "we consider three different viewing angles to the agn : @xmath76 ( polar view of the agn ) , @xmath77 ( intermediate view ) , and @xmath78 ( equatorial , through the torus , view of the agn ) .",
    "the intermediate viewing angle has been chosen to coincide with the half opening angle of this particular torus model , which corresponds to the transition between type 1 and type 2 objects . for the foreground extinction we used values of @xmath79mag , and the rieke & lebofsky ( 1985 ) extinction curve .",
    "the resulting spectra are shown in figure  7 . the reddened spectrum from a nearly face - on ( polar view )",
    "torus ( underlying seyfert 1 , @xmath80 ) will look similar to the intrinsic spectrum at a viewing angle closer to a true seyfert 2 ( @xmath81 ) given sufficient levels of foreground extinction ( @xmath82mag ) .",
    "however , moderate amounts of extinction will not have a significant effect on the nuclear fluxes at wavelengths greater than approximately @xmath83 .",
    "in addition , if a foreground screen of dust that is generally thick enough to modify the infrared seds has small holes , the view of the torus through these holes will dominate the flux in the near infrared and give an impression of a low level of extinction overall .",
    "the torus models place the source of the near - infrared emission close to the broad - line region , and of a diameter of order 1 pc ( compared with the size of about 0.01 pc for the blr ) .",
    "this general geometry is supported by observations of near - infrared variability with timescales of order a year ( e.g. , rieke & lebofsky 1979 ; lebofsky & rieke 1980 ; glass 1998 and references therein ) . to obscure the entire near - infrared - emitting region with a foreground cloud that nonetheless lets the broad emission lines through would take a highly contrived configuration for the obscuring cloud : a small hole aligned on the blr with no other holes elsewhere where near - infrared light could escape in our direction .",
    "thus , it is improbable that dust in the host galaxy could significantly modify the infrared sed and still allow broad lines to be detected in optical spectra .      the most remarkable aspect of the optical to mid - infrared non - stellar seds for the type @xmath6 galaxies ( see figure  3 ) is the high degree of uniformity , with a featureless continuum that is nearly flat in @xmath4 , similar to that of ngc  4151 . overall , the newly derived seds are not dramatically different from those inferred in previous works , since the dominance of the agn emission over the stellar emission in the nuclear regions makes detailed image deconvolution unimportant to derive true nuclear fluxes .",
    "however if we compare our seds on a case - by - case basis with those in edelson et al .",
    "( 1987 ) , it is clear that their seyfert 1 seds between @xmath84 and @xmath72 tend to appear bluer in @xmath85 than ours . we believe the fluxes at shorter wavelengths in edelson et al .",
    "( 1987 ) may still contain some contribution from stellar emission ( these authors used 8.5-diameter apertures for their photometry ) .",
    "the average values for the optical - infrared and infrared spectral indices of the seyfert @xmath6s ( 22 galaxies ) are @xmath86 and @xmath87 , where we have excluded ngc  6104 and mkn  993 ( optically classified as seyfert @xmath88 and seyfert @xmath89 , respectively ) as they clearly show seds more compatible with those of type 2 objects . for comparison edelson et al .",

    "( 1998 ) measured a median spectral index between @xmath93 and @xmath94 of @xmath95 for a heterogeneous sample of seyfert 1s .",
    "the fact that the infrared spectral indices are on average bluer than the optical - infrared indices is probably due to the presence of some amount of foreground dust in seyfert 1s .",
    "however , two type 1 galaxies , mkn  590 and ngc  7603 , have well - measured seds that depart significantly from the pattern established for the other type 1 objects .",
    "the seds of both start to drop from the near infrared towards the visible , relative to the flat seds ( in @xmath4 ) that are typical .",
    "we quantify this behavior from the nuclear fluxes measured at @xmath96 and @xmath16 since they use identical observational techniques and were obtained simultaneously ( hence variability is not an issue ) .",
    "relative to the median @xmath97 for the type 1 nuclei , an extinction of order a@xmath98mag is indicated for both galaxies .",
    "a similar extinction level would apply to the blr , which would make the identification of these galaxies as type 1 very improbable .",
    "we conclude that it is implausible that the differences in the seds for these two galaxies compared with the other type 1 objects can be explained in terms of identical intrinsic seds modified by foreground extinction .",
    "in clear contrast with the cfa seyfert @xmath6s , the seyfert 2s show a variety of spectral shapes ( see figure  5 , and also figure  6 ) .",
    "all the seyfert 2 galaxies have seds that rise steeply at increasing wavelengths ( @xmath100 ) , qualitatively similar to the sed of ngc  1068 .",
    "this behavior is roughly consistent with the unified model predictions for a seyfert 2 nucleus , that is , a heavily obscured version of the typical seyfert 1 sed .",
    "the seyfert 2 nuclei in the cfa sample have near - infrared colors and near - to - mid infrared colors in general redder than seen in the compilation by fadda et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , but similar to the seyfert 2s observed by alonso - herrero et al .",
    "one possibility is that the seyfert 2 photometry compiled by fadda et al .",
    "( 1998 ) was still contaminated with light from the galaxy for the short wavelengths , as the determination of the unresolved component is usually limited by the seeing conditions when using ground - based observations ( see alonso - herrero et al .",
    "the infrared spectral index of the median sed for a type 2 object in fadda et al .",
    "( 1998 ) is approximately @xmath101 between 1 and @xmath94 .",
    "however from figures  5 and 6 it is clear that it is not appropriate to define a median sed for type 2 objects , as it is precisely the variety of spectral shapes that needs to be reproduced by the torus models , as we will discuss in section  7 .",
    "some of the type 2 nuclei have substantial amounts of extended foreground dust associated with their host galaxies .",
    "for instance ngc  4388 and ngc  5929 have measured nlr extinctions of @xmath102mag ( see veilleux et al .",
    "1997 and rhee & larkin 2002 , respectively ) .",
    "the effect of correcting the observed seds for the indicated amounts of foreground extinction is small .",
    "foreground dust at the level seen in these galaxies can strongly affect the optical classification of the nuclear activity if it preferentially obscures the broad - line region ( as proposed by maiolino & rieke 1995 ) .",
    "however , this amount of dust does not seem capable of influencing the infrared seds sufficiently to account for the systematic differences seen between seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 seds .",
    "ugc  12138 , ngc  3786 , ngc  5033 , and ngc  5273 ( figure  4 ) are optically classified as seyfert @xmath8s , but have nearly flat seds , similar to those of seyfert @xmath6s ( see figure  3 ) .",
    "in fact their infrared spectral indices fall well within the values found for the cfa seyfert @xmath6s .",
    "the extinction maps of martini & pogge ( 1999 ) , based on @xmath103 colors , show that all four of these galaxies are free of heavy , extended obscuring foreground clouds in their host galaxies .",
    "we exclude from classification as type 1.9 those galaxies where the broad line component is only seen in the infrared , e.g. , pa@xmath25 .",
    "the intermediate - class galaxies um  146 , mkn  334 , mkn  471 , ngc  4258 , ngc  5252 , and ngc  5674 ( figure  4 ) , display intermediate seds ( infrared spectral indices in the range @xmath104 ) that do not drop toward short wavelengths as steeply as ngc  1068 . in most of these galaxies ,",
    "unresolved nuclear emission is measured from optical and/or near - infrared _ hst _ images . in all of these cases ,",
    "the @xmath103 images of martini & pogge ( 1999 ) suggest a possibility of extended obscuration from the host galaxy , although the bright and blue nucleus of mkn  471 indicates that it is probably clear of the nearby clouds .",
    "one possibility for the sy@xmath8 intermediate seds is that they are those of a true seyfert 1 galaxy seen through some foreground dust .",
    "however , an explanation of the steep infrared seds in terms of foreground dust is unlikely in the case of ngc  4258 .",
    "we have used the same approach described under type 1 objects , estimating the extinction needed to redden a median type 1 infrared sed to agree with the @xmath97 colors , and find for this galaxy a level equivalent to a@xmath105 @xmath106 10 , making observation of any broad - line component very problematic .",
    "a similar conclusion holds for ngc  7479 ; its @xmath97 is so red that the nucleus is not detected at the shorter wavelengths , but the nicmos upper limits demonstrate that it is heavily obscured ( if the intrinsic sed is seyfert-1-like ) .",
    "we therefore find four cases among the type 1 and intermediate - class seyfert galaxies where broad line components are seen despite an infrared sed that is either intrinsically red or is heavily reddened .",
    "the conclusion that broad line components can escape from systems with such seds is reinforced by the detection by ho et al .",
    "( 1997 ) of broad wings on h@xmath70 in ngc  1068 , ngc  3982 , and ngc  4388 . for many of this total of seven objects , under the unified model the `` extinction '' we see in the infrared sed is likely to be a property of the torus itself , rather than the result of a foreground obscuring cloud .",
    "the seyferts with intermediate seds are the most difficult for the disk and torus models to explain .",
    "the models are extremely sensitive to the viewing angle . only for a very small range of orientation angles , just grazing",
    "the surface of the disk or torus , are intermediate seds predicted .",
    "the models would also predict that the broad emission lines would be obscured at virtually all viewing angles where the near - infrared emission region is obscured . yet",
    "we find that @xmath107 of the galaxies with detectable broad lines in the optical have red infrared seds .",
    "that is , a strict dichotomy of seds correlated with emission - line properties is predicted , but is not in accordance with our measurements .",
    "there appears to be a deficit of seyfert @xmath6 galaxies in edge - on galaxies ( e.g. , keel 1980 ; lawrence & elvis 1982 ; maiolino & rieke 1995 ; schmitt et al . 2001 ) in most of the optically selected samples .",
    "in particular , maiolino & rieke ( 1995 ) concluded that the cfa sample has a deficiency of seyfert 1s in edge - on galaxies , caused by an extended torus ( scale of a 100pc ) coplanar with the host galaxy that obscures the blr .",
    "they predict that the spectrum of a seyfert 1 galaxy will look seyfert 2-like in many of these cases .",
    "the behavior of the infrared seds provides an independent way to estimate whether agns are of type 1 or 2 . where the nuclei may be obscured by dust in the host galaxy ,",
    "the seds are much less affected than the optical emission lines . using the sed shapes",
    ", we can check whether the portion of intrinsically type 1 galaxies is similar in edge - on systems to the portion found in optically selected samples in face - on galaxies .",
    "the axial ratios ( @xmath108 ) for the extended cfa sample of seyfert galaxies are taken from mcleod & rieke ( 1995 ) and ho et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . in figure  8",
    "we show the spectral indices as a function of the host galaxy inclination , @xmath108 .",
    "the galaxies have been divided in seyfert 1s ( 1 and 1.5 types ) and seyfert 2s ( 1.8 , 1.9 and 2 types ) according to their optical classification .",
    "we also mark in this figure for reference an axial ratio of @xmath109 ( or inclination of the host galaxy of @xmath110 ) .",
    "maiolino & rieke ( 1995 ) found that pure seyfert 1 galaxies with axial ratios of @xmath111 will be most likely classified as seyfert 1.8 or 1.9 .",
    "this result is confirmed by figure  8 .",
    "if we use the infrared sed to divide galaxies into probable type 1 and type 2 , we can see that in terms of the spectral index @xmath7 there are approximately equal numbers of type 1 ( @xmath112 , 6 galaxies ) and type 2 ( 5 galaxies ) in the highly inclined galaxies in the extended cfa sample ( figure  8 , right panel ) .",
    "these numbers are consistent those for the face - on members of the sample .",
    "this result confirms the suggestion by maiolino & rieke ( 1995 ) that seyfert 1 nuclei hosted in highly inclined galaxies may be misclassified as type 2 objects .",
    "for example , studies based on optical spectroscopy and that ignore inclination effects will overestimate the portion of type 2 nuclei .",
    "for the following discussion , we assume the validity of a unified model , that is we assume that all seyfert galaxies have similar dusty tori in their nuclei .",
    "we will try to find a geometry for these tori that is consistent with our observations .",
    "the broadness of the spectrum in the @xmath113 region and the nature of the @xmath10 silicate feature ( in absorption and emission ) have been a challenge for the torus models .",
    "compact torus models ( pier & krolik 1993 ) often predict spectra that are not sufficiently broad ( they lack emission in the near - infrared ) or they emit too strongly in the @xmath10 silicate feature for polar orientations . this issue has resulted in a suite of more extended disk models : the flared disk ( granato et al . 1997 ) , the tapered disk ( efstathiou & rowan - robinson 1995 ) , and the warped disk ( sanders et al . 1989 ) .",
    "excess emission in the near - infrared in ngc  1068 prompted pier & krolik ( 1993 ) to suggest that there was an additional clumpy dust component above the torus .",
    "this two component torus+cone model was also used by efstathiou et al .",
    "( 1995 ) to match the broad spectrum of ngc  1068 .    to suppress the silicate emission in type 1 objects",
    ", previous models forced the torus geometry to have extremely steep inner regions so that the region directly illuminated by uv radiation could only be viewed at high inclination angles .",
    "since the models were also driven by the belief that there was strong silicate absorption in the seyfert 2s , the outer disks were arranged so that at high inclination angles the inner hotter regions were only viewed through colder material ( e.g. , pier & krolik 1993 ; efstathiou & rowan - robinson 1995 ; granato et al .",
    "also pier & krolik ( 1993 ) models assumed high optical depths to be consistent with the high hard x - ray column densities often measured in seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "clavel et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have used _ iso _ spectroscopy ( through a @xmath114 aperture ) to show that seyfert 1 galaxies have little silicate emission , and a broad smooth infrared continuum . however , the seyfert 2s displayed pah emission and lower levels of continuum .",
    "in fact recent _ iso _ and ground - based mid - infrared spectroscopy of a small number of nearby agn show that the silicate absorption feature in some seyfert 2s might be shallower than previously inferred ( see e.g. , laurent et al .",
    "2000 , imanishi & ueno 2000 and le floch et al .",
    "2001 ) because measurements of the nearby continuum were contaminated with pah features originating in the host galaxy .",
    "the mid - infrared emission is probably slightly extended in many seyfert 2s ( maiolino et al .",
    "1995 ) across the region covered by the _ iso _",
    "spectra , so it is likely that there is some pah contribution from the surrounding galaxy in a number of cases .",
    "the nuclear spectrum itself might contain little or no pah emission .",
    "for example , little silicate absorption is seen in the _ iso_/sws nuclear spectrum of ngc  1068 and the continuum is nearly featureless ( le floch al .",
    "2000 , see also our figure  2 , left panel ) .",
    "in addition to the behavior of silicate feature , torus models can be constrained by the shapes of the seds for a complete sample of galaxies .",
    "to do so , we use the tapered disk model of efstathiou & rowan - robinson ( 1995 ) . in this geometry , the height of the disk increases with the radial distance , but tapers off to a constant height in the outer part .",
    "the main parameters of the model are the half opening angle of the torus @xmath115 , the equatorial uv optical depth @xmath116 , the dust sublimation temperature @xmath117 , the ratio between inner and outer radii @xmath118 , and the ratio between the scale height and the outer radius @xmath119 .",
    "table  8 summarizes the parameters of the models used here .",
    "in addition to the torus models , we will also consider the composite torus+cone model used by efstathiou et al .",
    "( 1995 ) to fit the sed of ngc  1068 .",
    "the viewing angles are defined as @xmath76 for the polar view of the agn , and @xmath81 for the equatorial view of the agn ( note that in the efstathiou & rowan - robinson 1995 models the authors measured the angles from the equator ) .    because of their high equatorial opacities , the torus models presented here ( but also those of pier & krolik 1993 ; granato & danese 1994 ; granato et al .",
    "1997 ) generally predict the following : ( i ) for viewing angles @xmath120 an sed more or less flat in @xmath4 depending on the model input parameters , and a direct view of the nuclear optical emission ; ( ii ) for viewing angles @xmath121 , a steep near and mid - infrared sed becoming steeper as the viewing angle increases , with no direct view of the nucleus ; ( iii ) an intermediate sed as well as some nuclear optical emission for only a very small range of possible viewing angles around @xmath122 .",
    "a dichotomy of spectral shapes is thus predicted , and few , if any , seyferts are expected to have an intermediate sed .",
    "this behavior is shown graphically in figure  9 where the predicted infrared spectral index ( @xmath7 ) is plotted against the cosine of the viewing angle for some of the models described in table  8 .",
    "the observed distribution of @xmath7 ( see figure  6 ) in the extended cfa sample clearly lacks the dichotomy of spectral indices predicted by the models .",
    "as discussed in section  5 , all the seyfert @xmath6s and a large fraction of the seyfert @xmath8s show infrared spectral indices clustered near @xmath123 .",
    "type 2 objects on the other hand show a variety of steeper spectral indices , unlike the model predictions .",
    "moreover the large opacity torus models without the extended cone component predict steeper seds ( @xmath124 ) than observed in the cfa seyferts for sufficiently large viewing angles .",
    "below , we discuss a number of possibilities to reconcile the observed seds with the model predictions .",
    "figure  9 shows that even the model with an equatorial optical depth of @xmath125mag ( @xmath126mag ) produces seds with @xmath124 for viewing angles @xmath127 .",

    "traditionally low opacity torus models have been ruled out because they tend to produce the @xmath10 silicate feature in emission for viewing angles of less than the half opening angle of the torus ( that is , type 1 objects ) .",
    "ground - based mid - infrared spectroscopy of seyfert 1s did not show evidence for this feature in emission ( roche et al .",
    "recently , however , clavel et al .",

    "additional observations are needed to resolve this issue .",
    "the extended conical component proposed in efstathiou et al .",
    "( 1995 ) was assumed to be optically thin and thus increases the continuum level around @xmath130 , causing the infrared spectral index to be shallower even for high viewing angles ( see figure  9 ) .",

    "the torus+cone model of efstathiou et al .",
    "( 1995 ) seems to reproduce well the observed distribution of @xmath7 in the type 2 objects in the cfa sample , although it will be necessary to increase the opening angle of the torus to match the observed relative numbers of type 1 and type 2 objects in the cfa sample .",
    "this model also reproduces well the observed infrared spectral indices of seyfert @xmath6s .",
    "this model still fails to solve the problem of the intermediate seyferts , as infrared spectral indices in the range @xmath131 are extremely unlikely to occur .",
    "this discrepancy can be solved with fine tuning of the models .",
    "for instance , a torus+cone model with a lower equatorial optical depth would make the transition of infrared spectral indices between type 1 and type 2 smoother , thus narrowing the range of unlikely spectral indices .",
    "another way of producing intermediate seds is having a range in the visibility of the scattering region .",
    "this could be done with a range in the @xmath119 parameter or if the scattering region is physically located at different distances from the nucleus .",
    "a more visible scattering region would produce a stronger @xmath132 continuum and therefore shallower seds . this could account for some of the intermediate seyferts ( figure  4 ) .",
    "nenkova , ivezi , & elitzur ( 2002 ) have recently put forward a more realistic model for the emission by dust in agns following the initial suggestion by pier & krolik ( 1993 ) that the dust in the torus must be in clumps to protect the grains .",
    "the parameters of this clumpy torus are , apart from the usual geometry parameters of the torus , the radial distribution of clouds , the number of clouds and the optical depth of the individual clouds . in their model a cloud is heated by radiation from both the agn and other surrounding clouds .",
    "the main result from this paper is that this model can reproduce simultaneously the broadness of the infrared seds and suppress the silicate feature emission with a few clouds ( @xmath133 ) with optical depths @xmath134 .",
    "nenkova et al .",
    "( 2002 ) only showed results from the limiting viewing angles of @xmath135 and @xmath136 , but from their figure  3 we can see that the equatorial view of the agn in that particular model produces an sed consistent with the steepest seds in the cfa sample .",
    "it remains to be seen if their model could reproduce the variety of observed seds measured for type 2 objects in the cfa sample .",
    "one concern in their comparison with observations , although they will provide a more detailed modelling in the near future , is the small number of type-2 seds fitted , and the possibility that some of the examples are contaminated by stellar processes .",

    "the majority of galaxies optically classified as seyfert types 1.8 and 1.9 display infrared spectral indices and seds either similar to those of type 1 objects or intermediate between seyfert 1s and seyfert 2s .",
    "the intermediate seds of many seyfert @xmath8s may be consistent with the presence of a pure seyfert 1 viewed through a moderate amount ( @xmath9mag ) of foreground galaxy extinction .    however , the abrupt division in sed shape correlated with emission - line properties that would be predicted by an optically thick torus model flat for type 1s and steep for type 2s is not observed .",
    "discrepancies with this model include the wide range of spectral indices observed in type 2 objects , the lack of extremely steep seds , and the large number of objects with intermediate properties .",
    "in addition , there are a surprisingly large number of galaxies with broad - line components and steep seds , a combination that conventional torus models would predict is very rare .",
    "these results , combined with the lack of deep @xmath10 silicate absorption feature in seyfert 2s and the possible presence of silicate emission in seyfert 1s ( clavel et al . 2000 ) , suggest that the region of infrared emission might not be as optically thick as previously considered .",
    "although x - ray and maser observations show that high opacity material does exist near the agn , it is not clear whether this material is responsible for the infrared emission . in a recent paper , risaliti , elvis , & nicastro ( 2002 )",
    "have shown that the observed fast variability ( a few months ) of hard x - ray column densities in seyfert 2s is not consistent with the absorbing material being located in the standard parsec scale torus .",
