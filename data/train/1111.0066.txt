    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) are believed to be the sources of galactic cosmic rays for many years .",
    "the underlying process from a theoretical point of view is the diffusive shock acceleration in which charged particles are accelerated in the expanding shocks of the snrs , receiving part of the kinetic energy of the shock through the first order fermi acceleration  @xcite .",
    "even though the last years provided increasing support by observational evidences , there is still no absolute proof that snrs can accelerate hadronic particles .",
    "the observations of high energy ( he , @xmath0 ) and very high energy ( vhe , @xmath1 ) gamma rays from many snrs clearly showed that they are sites of relativistic particles of energies compatible to the emission seen in gamma rays . to unambiguously establish the acceleration of hadronic particles , the hadronic origin of the observed gamma rays",
    "needs to be proven . in almost all cases ,",
    "electromagnetic scenarios ( gamma rays produced by up - scattering of photons through inverse compton scattering by accelerated electrons ) and hadronic scenarios ( gamma rays produced after the decay of @xmath2 ) can not be distinguished by looking only at the vhe gamma - ray regime .",
    "therefore observations at other wavelengths are needed to better understand the production mechanism of gamma rays .",
    "this includes on the one hand measurements of the parameters describing the interstellar medium ( ism ) around the object like magnetic field and density . on the other hand observations of he gamma rays in the range from mevs to gevs",
    "are very important because they can reveal features in the spectrum that can distinguish both possibilities . since the luminosity of gamma ray emission of a hadronic origin is proportional to the product of cr density and the density of the surrounding ism , the existence of dense molecular clouds close to the snr acts as a natural amplifier for the hadronic component . a tool to detect evidence of cosmic rays acceleration is therefore provided by gamma rays emitted by molecular clouds adjacent to or shocked by snrs  @xcite .",
    "w28  @xcite and ic443  @xcite are two examples where this effect might be responsible for the production of vhe gamma rays . in the w28 case ,",
    "gamma rays might be produced by cosmic rays that escaped the accelerating snr while in ic 443 a _ crushed cloud _ scenario might be at work where the molecular cloud is shocked by the blast wave region of the snr  @xcite .",
    "a major differnce in the two scenarios is the fact that the illumination of molecular clouds by runaway cosmic rays is affected by the energy dependent escape and diffusion of cosmic rays and might therefore show spectral features due to this . in the case of a _ crushed cloud _",
    "the diffusion effects are thought to be much smaller and the emission could be produced by the cosmic ray source spectrum itself .",
    "on the other hand re - acceleration of cosmic rays in the shocked cloud may play a role in this case .",
    "the snr w51c is a promising candidate to test and study cosmic ray acceleration in snrs .",
    "w51c is a mixed morphology snr with an elliptical shape in radio and a size of @xmath3 .",
    "it is located in the tangential point of the sagittarius arm at a distance of @xmath4  kpc  @xcite and the estimated age is around 30  kyrs .",
    "the w51 complex consists of three main components : two star - forming regions , w51a and w51b , and the snr w51c .",
    "while w51a is separated from the other two , w51b overlaps with the north - western rim of w51c .",
    "shocked atomic and molecular gases have been observed in radio data  @xcite  @xcite , providing direct evidence on the interaction of the w51c shock with a large molecular cloud .",
    "this strongly indicates that w51c represents a _ crushed cloud _ scenario rather than a cloud illumination scenario . in order to distinguish the two cases ,",
    "a precise knowledge of the spatial origin of the vhe emission is essential .",
    "x - ray emission has been detected from the star forming regions w51a and w51b .",

    "the predictions from the phenomenological model used by _",
    "fermi_/lat in  @xcite to explain the origin of the gamma - ray emission are also shown .",
    "three different scenarios are considered : one where gamma - ray emission is dominated by @xmath2 decay and two more where the gamma - ray emission is mainly dominated by inverse compton ( ic ) or bremsstrahlung of electrons .",
    "the vhe magic data points as well as h.e.s.s .",
    "point are above the predictions from the model in all scenarios at energies above 1 tev .",
    "although this seems to favor the electromagnetic scenarios , both leptonic models show difficulties in fitting the radio data and , in the case of the ic model , severe energy constraints .",
    "in addition both leptonic models need an electron to proton ratio in order of one .",
    "such a value is much higher than the one observed in direct cosmic ray measurements ( e / p @xmath18 ) and difficult to explain due to the much higher energy losses for electrons . concerning the hadronic emission the parameters used by the _ fermi_/lat - team leads to a proton spectral index between @xmath1710 and @xmath17500gev close to -3",
    ". a slightly harder index would be able to explain both magic and the _ fermi_/lat points .",
    "the spectral index measured by _",
    "fermi_/lat above 10 gev is @xmath19 @xcite . taken this into account the non matching of this hadronic scenario does not rule out a hadronic origin of the emission . moreover",
    "a hadronic origin predicts a constant slope of the gamma emission above several gev up to the cut - off originating from reaching the maximum energy of protons responsible for the emission .        the angular resolution of magic at energies of 100  gev is comparable to that of _ fermi_/lat .",
    "for energies above 700  gev , the angular resolution magic is as low as @xmath20 .",
    "this allows for a unprecedented resolution sky map from w51c .",
    "figure  [ mw_map ] shows the magic view of w51c overlapped with data from different wavelengths . the overall magic emission above 700  gev is contained within the region of 3 counts above 1gev by _ fermi_/lat ( pink line in the figure ) .",
    "the higher angular resolution resolves that the gross of the vhe gamma - ray emission above 700  gev is spatially coincident with the shocked gas region reported by koo et al . in  @xcite",
    "this also supports the hadronic origin of the he - vhe gamma rays .",
    "furthermore there is an extension roughly following the shape of the remnants shell in radio and the _ fermi_/lat he emission .",
    "in addition this vhe emission towards the south - east goes in the direction of the pwn candidate .",
    "magic observations do not only confirm the emission of he - vhe gamma rays from an extended source located in the snr w51c , but extend the spectrum almost without gap above the _",
    "fermi_/lat energies .",
    "the measured sed is in agreement with a extrapolation of the fermi data and agrees with the flux measured by the h.e.s.s .",
    "the emission measured by magic is spatially coincident with that reported by _",
    "moreover , the higher angular resolution provided by magic shows that the bulk of the vhe gamma - ray emission comes from the shocked molecular cloud located where the snr shock engulfs a large molecular cloud , creating a shocked gas region distinguishable in the radio data .",
    "this fact , a constant spectral index of the emission from @xmath17gev to multi - tev , and the problems to explain the emission in a leptonic scenario suggest that the gamma - ray emission has most likely a hadronic origin as it is expected in the case of gamma rays produced in a _ crushed cloud _ scenario .",
