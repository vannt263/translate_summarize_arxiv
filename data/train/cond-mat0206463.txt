    "quantum electronic transport properties in semiconductor superlattices in high electric fields have been the subject of much interest in recent years .",
    "experimental studies have reported interesting phenomena , such as bloch oscillations and wannier - stark ( * ws * ) ladders .",
    "xp1 moreover , a number of theoretical predictions have been made , including negative differential conductivity , on dynamical localization , dy and fractional ws ladders under dc and ac fields , fws to name a few .",
    "one important issue for the dynamical behavior of a real system is the effect of electron - phonon interactions , and extensive research in this field has been reported .",
    "for example , ghosh _",
    "et al_. and dekorsy _",
    "et al_. studied coupled bloch - phonon oscillations .",
    "blo the phonon - assisted hopping of an electron on a ws ladder was studied in [ ] . a brilliant variational treatment of inelastic quantum transport was given in [ ] , and anomalies in transport properties under a resonance condition were studied in [ ] .",
    "et al_. studied the optical absorption associated with the resonance of a ws ladder and the optical phonon frequency in a system . gov1,gov2",
    "a similar and fascinating system of electron - phonon resonance in magnetic fields has also been studied extensively .",
    "mag    much of the work in this area considers incoherent scattering of electrons by phonons , which is the relevant picture in systems at high temperature . in this paper , however , we report a study of the effects of coherent coupling of an electron to the phonons of the system , likely to be the relevant description at low temperatures .",
    "we concentrate on how the phonon coupling affects electron transport in high electric field , in a situation typically achieved in semiconductor superlattices , for instance , but also important for electrons in polymer chains , onwell and even perhaps reachable in a stack of self - assembled quantum dots .",
    "dots    based on a holstein model , olst typically used to describe the small polaron in molecular systems , we analyze the spectrum of the system and study its transport properties .",
    "we use here a non - perturbative description , which allows one to elucidate the effects of resonant and non - resonant phonon fields on the otherwise localized electrons residing in a ws ladder , for both weak and strong electron - phonon coupling .",
    "we find that for small hopping and coupling constant , an interesting regime results when two characteristic energy scales in the system coincide : the one corresponding to the energy spacing between the ws levels , and the other corresponding to the frequency of the phonons . in this",
    "_ resonant _ case , the problem is one of strong mixing between degenerate states with rather different properties . the result is a complex semi - continuous band structure replacing each of the original ws ladder ` rungs ' , where some of the electron states become _ delocalized _ , despite the strong electric field present . in this case",
    ", the phonons interacting with the electron provide delocalization , unlike the usual situation .",
    "moreover , and in contrast to these extended states , ` stretched polarons ' are highly degenerate and exhibit strongly localized electronic components , while the phonon component is in fact extended throughout the structure .",
    "when the system is away from the resonance condition , a deformed ws ladder will appear , with very interesting substructure .",
    "the electronic wave functions in this regime are all localized , but with a localization length that depends linearly on the degree of detuning .    in all phonon frequency regimes ,",
    "the rich dynamical behavior of the system is due to ( or reflected in ) the near fractal structure of the spectrum .",
    "this , as we will discuss , has a direct connection to the cayley tree structure of the relevant hilbert space .",
    "this structure is of course contained in the hamiltonian and reflected also in the structure of the eigenvectors .",
    "we also extend our studies beyond the weak coupling and small hopping constant regime , via a lang - firsov transformation .",
    "this results in an interesting mapping of the problem from the strong coupling to the weak limit , and allows one to extend the results for a wider parameter range .",
    "a first report of the resonant case in the weak coupling regime has been published .",
    "@xcite here , we give a detailed theory of such states , including both resonant and non - resonant cases , and present the strong coupling interaction regime .    in what remains of the paper , we give in section [ description ] a description of the model used and the relevant hilbert space in the problem .",
    "section [ weak ] contains a complete analysis of the resulting spectrum for small hopping constant and weak phonon coupling .",
    "the extension beyond that regime is given in section [ strong ] .",
    "a final discussion is presented in section [ discussion ] .",
    "we consider the holstein model , olst which describes an electron in a one - dimensional tight - binding lattice , interacting locally with dispersionless optical phonons .",
    "moreover , the system is subjected to a strong static electric field .",
    "the hamiltonian is then given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the electron hopping constant , @xmath2 the phonon frequency ( or energy , with @xmath3 ) , @xmath4 the electron - phonon coupling constant , @xmath5 the site energy , @xmath6 the electric field , and @xmath7 is the lattice constant .",
    "it is known that a series of localized ws states will form in a strong field ( @xmath8 ) , in the absence of interactions between electron and phonons . within tight - binding theory , the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of these ws",
    "states are , respectively @xmath9 , and | _ j = _",
    "i j_i - j ( 2t / ede ) |i , where @xmath10 is the @xmath11-th order bessel function .",
    "the ws states are localized states with characteristic length @xmath12 .",
    "it is helpful to introduce creation and annihilation operators for ws states as d_j=_i=-^ j_i - j(2t / ede ) c_i .",
    "it is easy to show that this transformation is canonical , @xmath13 , and that the hamiltonian can be written in terms of @xmath14 as @xmath15 in the case of strong electric field ( or small hopping constant , @xmath16 ) in which we concentrate in this section , the hamiltonian can be simplified as @xmath17 where the effective coupling constant is now @xmath18 from ( [ h ] ) , one can see phonon - assisted hopping between the ws states quite clearly , so that in fact the phonons introduce delocalization of the ws electrons .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) is similar to that in [ ] , but there are some differences . in the current model ,",
    "when an electron jumps from one site to the next , it can not only emit ( or absorb ) a phonon on ( from ) its site , but also onto ( from ) the nearby site .",
    "this more natural description also produces a large difference on the relevant hilbert spaces .",
    "the dimension of the relevant hilbert space in our case is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the number of local sites in the chain , while the size is @xmath20 for the model in [ ] .",
    "as we will see , the resulting energy spectrum and other physical quantities show quite a rich behavior .",
    "let us consider the process of an electron jumping between sites while creating or annihilating phonons in its neighborhood .",
    "for example , for a chain of three sites , @xmath21 , the hopping of the electron from the first site will connect the states @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . here",
    "a vector is expressed as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the electron position , and @xmath31 refers to the number of phonons on site @xmath32 .",
    "it is interesting to see that the connectivity of this portion of hilbert space has the structure of a cayley tree , or a bethe lattice.ar under the condition of resonance , i.e. , @xmath33 , all the states above for @xmath21 have the same energy .",
    "the off - diagonal matrix elements therefore break the degeneracy and allow level mixing , and one can expect that some kind of band may form in the limit of large @xmath20 . as we will see later on , and in contrast to the resonant case , the spectrum in off - resonance is still composed of ladders although with a complex structure .",
    "note    in the basis we list above , the hamiltonian for @xmath21 takes the form    [ h33 ] h= ( - & & - & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 + & -2 + & 0 & & 0 & - & 0 + - & 0 & -2 + & 0 & & 0 & - + 0 & & 0 & -3 + 2 & 0 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 0 & & 0 & -3 + 2 & 0 & 0 + 0 & - & 0 & 0 & 0 & -3 + 2 & 0 + 0 & 0 & - & 0 & 0 & 0 & -3 + 2 ) .",
    "a direct consequence of the cayley tree connectivity of the near degenerate basis is that the hamiltonian ( [ h33 ] ) is constructed by diagonal block matrices for ever larger @xmath20 ( of sizes 1 , 2 , 4 , ... , 2@xmath34 ) , and mixed by off - diagonal matrix elements proportional to @xmath35 .",
    "one can see that in the resonant case , all diagonal elements are given by @xmath36 , corresponding to the degenerate manifold .",
    "notice also that the off - diagonal elements are given by @xmath37 , except for a few sporadic elements which appear as @xmath38 , associated with higher number of phonons in a site , such as the state @xmath39 in this case .",
    "this nearly self - similar structure appears for all values of @xmath20 .",
    "we expect then that there would be little change in the physical properties in the large @xmath20 limit if we replace @xmath40 in those few off - diagonal spots with @xmath41 .",
    "this will be confirmed by our numerical calculation , as we will see below . after the substitution , the new _ symmetrized _",
    "hamiltonian @xmath42 takes a full self - similar form , and allows one to exactly solve analytically the eigenvalue problem , and better understand the physics of the system .",
    "much of the behavior of @xmath42 remains in the actual system described by @xmath43 .",
    "let us consider the eigenvalue problem for the hamiltonian @xmath42 , defined as that in ( [ h33 ] ) , except that the elements @xmath44 are replaced by @xmath41 . by using the block decomposition formula ( a & b + c & d ) = ( d ) ( a - bd^-1c ) , we find that the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian @xmath42 are determined by the equation _ 0^n/2",
    "_ 1^n/4 _ 2^n/8 ...",

    "then , @xmath49 can be written as a continuous fraction in @xmath32 steps _ k+1=-t_k- .",
    "[ contfract ]      in this case , @xmath51 ( after a constant energy shift of @xmath2 is made ) , we obtain the eigenvalues of @xmath42 as _ k , j=2 ( ) , [ cos - band ] where @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",
    "the asymptotic bandwidth of the spectrum is therefore given by @xmath54 . notice that this behavior is similar to that of a system in magnetic fields . in that case",
    ", the electron - phonon interaction breaks the degeneracy ( under the condition of magnetic resonance ) and leads to a  resonance splitting . \" in that case , the splitting is @xmath55 for a three dimensional system , and @xmath56 for a two dimensional system , where @xmath57 is the frohlich electron - phonon coupling constant .",
    "mag let us consider the question of eigenvalue degeneracy by solving @xmath58 , which will provide us with a good estimate in the large @xmath59 limit .",
    "after some algebra , one obtains for the eigenvalue equation , @xmath60 we then have eigenvalues @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , with respective degeneracies of @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath67 .",
    "higher order polynomials would slightly improve the degeneracy estimate for successively higher eigenvalues .    our numerical results for the eigenvalues of @xmath42 , fig .  1 , and @xmath43 , fig",

    "the different panels in these figures show spectra for @xmath68 , 9 , and 11 .",
    "one can see that the main structure of the spectra changes little with increasing @xmath20 , although finer structure appears for higher @xmath20 , filling to some extent the gaps of the previous structure .",
    "our analytical results match exactly those of fig .  1 .",
    "the self - similar structure of the spectrum is the manifestation of such symmetry in @xmath42 .",
    "one can see that the original highly degenerate manifold is broadened into a semi - continuous band by the off - diagonal mixing elements of @xmath42 .",

    "we should emphasize that the properties illustrated in fig .",
    "4 and 5 are quite generic : states in one of the highly ( nearly ) degenerate levels show different degrees of electron localization and an abundance of phonons , in a stretched polaron configuration .",

    "the transport properties provide information about the density of states in the structure and the spatial charge distribution of the different states ( for optical response , see [ ] ) .",
    "the contribution of various eigenstates to the charge transport can be described by the quantity d_=p_(1 ) p_(n ) , since the tunneling amplitude is proportional to the density of states in the leads and the wavefunction amplitudes at both ends of the structure ( the site @xmath94 and @xmath95 ) .",

    "figure 13 shows the coupling constant dependence of the bandwidth @xmath149 for the resonant and stronger coupling limit , @xmath150 .",

    ", the bands in neighboring ws rungs will begin to overlap ( and interband terms would need to be considered ) .",
    "it is clear that these corrections to the dependence of @xmath149 appear also as function of @xmath1 , @xmath153 , and/or @xmath2 .",
    "similar discussions are also relevant in the off - resonant case . for example , since the localization length is proportional to @xmath154 ( section iii.b ) , there is also a correction to the simple relation @xmath155 , when @xmath1 and/or @xmath148 are not small . for example , with increasing coupling constant , the correction to the ladder @xmath156 may become comparable with the spacing between the detuned ladder levels @xmath123 . in that case , the ladder structure for the off - resonance case will also disappear . in this situation , the electron can also become delocalized , even if in the non - resonant regime , but due to the strong coupling @xmath157 .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results to those of bonca and trugman , ru as one goes from the weak to the strong tunneling regime .",
    "these authors found by numerical calculation of the drift velocity that for small electron - phonon coupling , there are energies where the electron can not propagate . in our approach , this corresponds to the formation of the quasi - continuous band for each of the ws ladders .",
    "the electron can not propagate when its energy lies in the band gap .",
    "however , with increasing coupling constant , the band gap will disappear because of the overlap of subsequent bands .",
    "more quantitatively , let us consider the case @xmath158 ( as the parameters in [ ] ) . since the hopping constant is large , one needs to adopt the formalism in this section . as seen in fig .  13",

    "this vanishing of the gaps as a function of @xmath157 would coincide with the resumption of particle drift in the system .",
    "just such behavior was found numerically in [ ] , and one can now explain it in terms of the level structure of the system .",
    "it is also interesting to notice that the overall envelope seen in @xmath105 is similar to that of the drift velocity : small at the center and edge of each band , as shown here in fig .  7b , and qualitatively like the graphs in figure 4 of reference [ ] .",

    "we have studied the coherent dynamics of holstein polarons in a strong electric field . we have found that with the help of phonons , a sort of quasi - continuous band will form under resonance conditions , even for weak coupling constants .",
    "the band shows approximate fractal self - similar structure , which is inherent in the near self - similarity of the hamiltonian .",
    "although the phonons can help the electron jump from one ws ladder state to another , the phonons can also prevent the electron from propagating , if too many phonons are involved .",
    "these peculiar interaction differences give rise to a variety of unusual states , including : ( a ) delocalized polarons despite the strong electric field , with a typical phonon cloud accompanying the electron ; and ( b ) states with high degeneracy at the band center , where the electron is localized in a site of the lattice , and the phonon is located away from the electron , in a stretched configuration .",
    "the band structure is also manifested in transport properties of the system , which we expect could be observed in tunneling experiments .",
    "the level structure and extension of the different states will appear as a modulation of the phonon replicas in the tunneling experiment .",
    "for weak coupling , this would only occur if the system is in resonance , @xmath160 , as away from that condition the states are basically localized and would not transport current ( except for thermal effects ) . in a given structure , the resonance condition can be reached by sweeping the electric field , while monitoring the tunneling through the structure . as the spacing between the deformed rungs and the localization length of the eigenfunction can be adjusted by electric field",
    ", it would be quite interesting to see the transition in experiments .",
    "with increasing coupling constant , the ` minibands ' will overlap , and give rise to an overall merging of the phonon replicas in tunneling , even when away from the resonance regime .",

    "<S> the coherent dynamics of a holstein polaron in strong electric fields is considered under different regimes . using analytical and numerical analysis , we show that even for small hopping constant and weak electron - phonon interaction , the original discrete wannier - stark ( ws ) ladder electronic states are each replaced by a semi - continuous band if a resonance condition is satisfied between the phonon frequency and the ladder spacing . in this regime , the original localized ws states can become _ delocalized _ , yielding both ` tunneling ' and ` stretched ' polarons . </S>",
    "<S> the transport properties of such a system would exhibit a modulation of the phonon replicas in typical tunneling experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the modulation will reflect the complex spectra with nearly - fractal structure of the semi - continuous band . in the off - resonance regime , the ws ladder </S>",
    "<S> is strongly deformed , although the states are still localized to a degree which depends on the detuning : both the spacing between the levels in the deformed ladder and the localization length of the resulting eigenfunctions can be adjusted by the applied electric field . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the regime beyond small hopping constant and weak coupling , and find an interesting mapping to that limit via the lang - firsov transformation , which allows one to extend the region of validity of the analysis . </S>"
