    "the search for supersymmetry and its breaking , in addition to the direct searches at lep , b - factories , tevatron and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , is actively pursued using the wmap limits on the relic density constraints . however the sensitivity of the lightest supersymmetric particle relic density calculation to the variation of the cosmological expansion rate before big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , even if modest and with no consequences on the cosmological observations , can modify considerably the relic density , and therefore change the constraints on the supersymmetric parameter space @xcite . in the standard cosmology",
    "the dominant component before bbn is radiation , however energy density and entropy content can be modified . in the following",
    "we consider the impact of different scenarios of alternative cosmologies .",
    "the precision of the wmap data should therefore not make us forget the hypothesis which are implied by the use of standard cosmology .",
    "we discuss in the following the implications of precision b - physics , direct searches and cold dark matter relic abundance for the case of anomaly mediated models , from a minimal anomaly mediation supersymmetry breaking @xcite , to mixed moduli - anomaly mediated @xcite and to hypercharge anomaly mediation @xcite .",
    "we also discuss similar supersymmetry breaking scenarios in the case of the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model . in section [ sec : models ] we discuss the different anomaly mediated supersymmetry breakings in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) in terms of the parameter spaces for these models and discuss the limits which can be applied due to the present data from particle physics experiments and from relic dark matter density assuming the standard model of cosmology . in section [ sec : models2 ] similar scenarios are considered in the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) and the corresponding particle and cosmological bounds are discussed . in section [ sec : cosmologies ] we discuss how alternative cosmological models can affect dramatically the bounds on the parameter space of the models we have considered while letting unchanged the observable cosmology .",
    "four different alternatives to the standard cosmology are discussed which share this behaviour .",
    "section [ sec : constr ] and section [ sec : lhc ] discuss respectively the constraints implied by these different cosmological scenarios and the perspectives at the lhc for a list of benchmark points which are representative of the available parameter space for these amsb models .",
    "our conclusions are given in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the superconformal anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking ( amsb ) mechanism @xcite is one of the most well - known and attractive set - ups for supersymmetry breaking .",
    "supersymmetry breaking effects in the observable sector have in this framework a gravitational origin .",
    "superconformal symmetry is classically preserved in theories without dimensional parameters and it is in general broken by the quantum effects . as anomalies only depend on the low - energy effective theory , the same will be true for the soft terms .",
    "usually the amsb scenario can not be applied to the mssm , as it leads to tachyonic sleptons .",
    "however the presence of an intermediate threshold can displace the soft terms and avoid this problem . in superconformal gravity one",
    "introduces a chiral superfield playing the role of the compensating multiplet for super - weyl transformations , called the weyl or conformal compensator .",
    "the f - term vacuum expectation value of the conformal compensator is turned on by the supersymmetry breaking in the hidden sector and the soft breaking of supersymmetry in the visible sector appears through the chiral anomaly supermultiplet .",
    "as the soft susy breaking terms arise from the anomaly , the supersymmetry breaking terms do not dominate at tree - level .",
    "several soft susy breaking scenarios can be realised starting from this setup .",
    "we discuss in the following some of these realisations .",
    "the minimal amsb ( mamsb ) scenario @xcite has very attractive properties , since the soft susy breaking terms are calculated in terms of one single parameter , namely the gravitino mass @xmath3 , and the soft terms are renormalisation group invariants which can be calculated for any scale choice .",
    "however , the amsb scenarios suffer from the problem that slepton squared masses are found to be negative , leading to tachyonic states .",
    "a solution to this problem is to consider that the scalar particles acquire a universal mass @xmath4 at the gut scale , which when added to the amsb soft susy breaking terms , makes them positive .",
    "therefore , the mamsb model relies on only four parameters : @xmath5    this scenario has been thoroughly studied in the literature , but is known to have cosmological consequences incompatible with the wmap observations of the dark matter density @xcite .",
    "we perform here an updated analysis of the mamsb parameter space constraints from flavour physics and cosmological relic density . for this study",
    ", we generate mass spectra and couplings using isajet 7.80 @xcite .",
    "the calculation of flavour observables and the computation of the relic density are performed with superiso relic v3.0 @xcite .",
    "we use the constraints given in table  9 of the latest version of the superiso manual .",
    "the first flavour observable that we consider here is the branching ratio of @xmath6 , which has been been thoroughly studied in the literature and is still under scrutiny .",
    "this observable is very interesting , as its sm contributions only appear at loop level , and its theoretical uncertainties as well as the experimental errors are now under control .",
    "it provides strong constraints on the supersymmetric parameter space , especially for large @xmath7 , where it receives large enhancements from its supersymmetric contributions .",
    "we use the following interval at 95% c.l .",
    "@xcite : @xmath8    another interesting observable is the branching fraction of @xmath9 , which is also a loop level observable , and which can receive extremely large contributions from susy at large @xmath10 , and can receive an enhancement of several orders of magnitude compared to the sm branching ratio . this decay mode has not yet been observed , and we have at 95% c.l .",
    "@xcite : @xmath11    we also consider a set of tree - level observables which are very sensitive to the charged higgs mass as well as @xmath10 , and we use the following 95% level intervals , which include the theoretical and experimental errors @xcite : @xmath12 the observable @xmath13 is related to the decay of @xmath14 and is detailed in @xcite .",
    "+ for the relic density constraint , we use the wmap constraints @xcite increased by 10% of theoretical error to account for the uncertainties in the calculation of the relic density : @xmath15 in the following , we disregard the case of negative @xmath16 since it is disfavoured by the muon anomalous magnetic moment constraint , and we scan over the intervals @xmath17 $ ] gev , @xmath18 $ ] tev and @xmath19 $ ] .",
