    "for explicit calculations of instationary solutions to hyperbolic conservation laws , the timestep is dictated by the cfl condition due to courant , friedrichs and lewy @xcite , which requires that the numerical speed of propagation should be at least as large as the physical one .",
    "for implicit schemes , the cfl condition does not provide a restriction , since the numerical speed of propagation is infinite . depending on the equations and the scheme",
    ", restrictions may come in via the stiffness of the resulting nonlinear problem .",
    "these restrictions are usually not as strict as in the explicit case , where the cfl number should be below unity . for implicit calculations , cfl numbers of 10 , 100 or even 1000",
    "may well be possible .",
    "therefore , it is a serious question how large the timestep , i.e. the cfl number , should be chosen .",
    "we are particularly interested in timestep control which is based upon computable , a - posteriori error estimates . in @xcite krner and ohlberger",
    "based their space - time adaptivity upon @xmath3 , kuznetsov type estimates for scalar conservation laws . in @xcite ,",
    "eriksson and johnson developed space - time adaptive methods for parabolic pde s .",
    "these a - posteriori error estimates require the solution of an adjoint problem .",
    "a space - time projection of the adjoint solution makes it possible to consider spatial and temporal error separately .",
    "they closed the error estimates by an a - priori bound on the dual solution . in @xcite , sli and houston developed an analogous approach for hyperbolic transport equations .",
    "the work of eriksson and johnson has been extended by many authors , see , for example , the review articles of becker and rannacher @xcite and of hoffman and johnson @xcite .",
    "we would like to mention that we learned a lot about these developments from the unpublished thesis of ralf hartmann @xcite . instead of relying upon an ( usually pessimistic ) a - priori error estimate for the adjoint solution , hartmann and others @xcite _ computed _ the adjoint solution and",
    "hence obtained an ( in principle exact ) error representation .",
    "more recently these methods have also been developed for hyperbolic problem by barth , hartmann , houston , giles , sli , schwab and others .",
    "an excellent collection of review papers may be found in @xcite .",
    "let us briefly summarize the space - time splitting of the adjoint error representation ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the error representation expresses the error in a target functional as a scalar product of the finite element residual with the dual solution .",
    "this error representation is decomposed into separate spatial and temporal components .",
    "the spatial part will decrease under refinement of the spatial grid , and the temporal part under refinement of the timestep .",
    "technically , this decomposition is achieved by inserting an additional projection .",
    "usually , in the error representation , one subtracts from the dual solution its projection onto space - time polynomials .",
    "now , we also insert the projection of the dual solution onto polynomials in time having values which are @xmath4 functions with respect to space .    this splitting can be used to develop a strategy for a local choice of timestep . here",
    "we add to the results in @xcite by studying a weakly instationary solution to burgers equation , for which the timestep will be very large ( and we will quantify this ) in regions of stationary flow , and become small when a perturbation enters the flow field .",
    "we believe that this type of flow is a prime example where the space - time splitting can become useful .",
    "besides applying adjoint techniques which are already well - established to a new test problem , we also add a new ingredient which simplifies and accelerates the computation of the dual problem . due to galerkin orthogonality",
    ", the dual solution @xmath0 does not enter the error representation as such .",
    "instead , the relevant term is the difference of the dual solution and its projection to the finite element space , @xmath1 .",
    "we can show that it is therefore sufficient to compute the spatial gradient of the dual solution , @xmath5 .",
    "this gradient satisfies a conservation law instead of a transport equation , and it can therefore be computed with the same algorithm as the forward problem , and in the same finite element space .    our goal here is time step adaptation . ultimately , this will become a building block of an aerodynamic and aeroelastic solver which is currently being developed by the sfb 401 research group at rwth aachen @xcite . in that solver ,",
    "multiscale analysis is used to compress data , coarsen and refine the spatial grid .",
    "time stepping for instationary problems is done by a methods of lines approach , using explicit or implicit runge - kutta schemes .",
    "the latter is , of course , a standard set - up used for aerodynamic , or conservation law , solvers .    in the aerodynamical applications which we have in mind",
    ", we may have to resolve many different features of the flow , more than can be controlled by a small number of functionals like drag and lift .",
    "therefore , an adaptive monitoring of the complete flow field , as done by the multiscale analysis , is very desirable .",
    "here we develop our strategy for a test case .",
    "since we focus on timestep adaptation we will use uniformly refined meshes in space . starting with a very coarse spatial mesh and cfl below unity",
    ", we gradually establish sequences of timesteps which are well adapted to the physical problem at hand .",
    "the scheme detects stationary regions , where it switches to very high cfl numbers , but reduces the time steps appropriately as soon as a perturbation enters the flow field .",
    "depending on the cfl number and the cost of the nonlinear solver , the adaptive scheme chooses either explicit or implicit timesteps . for reasons of efficiency , very small timesteps",
    "@xmath6 may be merged into a single step .",
    "this strategy is detailed in section [ sec.applications.strategy ] .",
    "once we arrive at the fine spatial mesh , on which we really want to compute and where most of the work is being done , we already work with a very efficient time step .",
    "moreover , we have a rational criterion what the finest grid should be .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec.theory ] we review the theoretical background for our adaptive timestep control : dg and fv methods , control of target functionals , error representation , space - time splitting , error estimates .",
    "the new conservative approach for solving the dual problem is presented in section  [ sec.newapproach ] . in section [ sec.applications ]",
    "we define our adaptive strategy and apply it to compute perturbations of a stationary shock .",
    "some conclusions are drawn in section [ sec.conclusions ] .",
    "in this section , we recall some of the theoretical background of adjoint error control , and we represent the extensions needed in our time adaptive strategy . in section  [ sec.dg_method ]",
    "we introduce the dg method used in the paper . in section [ sec.error_representations ] we state the adjoint based error representation for target functionals . in section  [ sec.space_time_splitting ]",
    "we introduce a variant of the projections in space and time which lead to a splitting of the error representation .",
    "one part decreases when the spatial grid is refined , and the other part decays with the timestep .",
    "the corresponding decay rates are a crucial ingredient of the time - adaptation strategy .",
    "this strategy and its application will be presented in section  [ sec.applications ] below .",
    "let @xmath7 be an open connected subset of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , let @xmath10 be the time interval and let @xmath11 be the space - time domain , with boundary @xmath12 and outside unit normal @xmath13 .",
    "we consider the system @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the vector of conservative variables and @xmath16 the flux matrix , with @xmath17 .",
    "the vector @xmath18 is the space - time normal flux across the boundary , and for scalar equations , the inflow boundary is given by @xmath19 note that includes initial data , since @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "for systems of conservation laws , the definition of in- and outflow boundaries may be generalized via characteristic decompositions @xcite .",
    "let us define a partition of our time interval @xmath22 into subintervalls @xmath23 , where @xmath24 later on this partition will be defined automatically by the adaptive algorithm .",
    "furthermore we define a regular polygonal spatial grid @xmath25 such that @xmath26 .",
    "we denote the corresponding space time prisms by @xmath27 for future reference , we denote the outward unit normal vector to @xmath28 by @xmath29 or simply @xmath13 .",
    "thus we have constructed a subdivision @xmath30 of the computational domain @xmath31 .",
    "the spatial discretisation @xmath32 can change adaptively from timestep to timestep , and for each fixed time interval @xmath33 , the timestep is global ( i.e. it is the same for all spatial cells @xmath34 ) .    we do not admit local timesteps , since we want to couple our time - adaptive strategy to standard runge - kutta finite volume methods and runge - kutta discontinuous galerkin methods .    on this grid",
    "we define the following function spaces : first , let @xmath35 be the mesh dependent broken space of discontinuous piecewise @xmath4 functions defined on @xmath36 , @xmath37 furthermore we denote by @xmath38 the ( locally ) finite dimensional space consisting of discontinuous piecewise polynomial functions of degree @xmath39 in space and @xmath40 in time defined on @xmath41 @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the space of polynomials of degree @xmath40 on @xmath33 and @xmath44 the space of polynomials of degree @xmath39 on @xmath34 .",
    "given a cell @xmath28 and a point @xmath45 , we define the inner ( @xmath46 ) and outer ( @xmath47 ) values of a function @xmath48 with via @xmath49 defining the dg method for nonlinear conservation laws , whose solutions in general contain shock waves , requires a careful application of the theory of weak solutions , which states that for a weak solution @xmath50 and a continuously differentiable test functions @xmath51 , @xmath52 thus we have to define the normal flux @xmath53 at the cell boundaries , where the approximate solution @xmath54 is discontinuous .",
    "this can be done with the help of numerical flux functions , which we denote by @xmath55 .",
    "so suppose that @xmath56 is contained in an interior edge .",
    "if @xmath57 , so that the normal points into the spatial direction , then the canonical choice for @xmath55 is an approximate riemann solver @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the outer normal to @xmath34 ( i.e. @xmath60 ) .",
    "we require that the flux @xmath55 is consistent and conservative in the sense of lax . if , on the other hand , @xmath61 , so that the normal points into the time direction and @xmath62 , then we simply require that @xmath55 be a convex combination of @xmath63 . more specifically ,",
    "suppose that @xmath64 .",
    "then we set @xmath65 for some value @xmath66 $ ] .",
    "different values of @xmath67 will yield different time discretisations , e.g. explicit euler for @xmath68 , implicit euler for @xmath69 , if we work with piecewise constant ansatz functions .    on the boundary of the domain ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath70 , we set @xmath71 in the following definition we simply state the resulting dg(s , r ) method , which is a discontinuous method both in space and time .",
    "this definition is very similar to , see e.g. @xcite and the references therein .",
    "\\(i ) the abstract semilinear form @xmath72 is given by @xmath73 ( ii ) now the dg(s , r ) finite element method for the system of hyperbolic conservation laws is defined as follows : find @xmath74 , such that @xmath75    as usual , the variational formulation , can be exploited as follows : given @xmath76 , @xmath77 is a linear functional on @xmath35 .",
    "thus it can be represented by an element of @xmath35 , which we call @xmath78 , the _",
    "residual_. on the interior of a cell @xmath28 we introduce the _ cell residual _ @xmath79 and on the boundaries @xmath80 the _ edge residual _",
    "@xmath81 then can be rewritten as @xmath82 the @xmath83 solution @xmath84 of is now given by @xmath85 which is the classical galerkin orthogonality : the residual @xmath78 is orthogonal to the test space @xmath38 .    in the following , we mostly work with the @xmath86 and @xmath87 methods , both in their explicit ( @xmath88 ) and implicit ( @xmath89 ) form .",
    "the dg(0,0 ) method is equivalent to a first order accurate finite volume scheme , using explicit order implicit euler scheme for the time integration . for higher oder accurate finite volume schemes we refer to barth and larson @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "barth and larson derive a weak formulation of the form for higher oder accurate finite volume schemes .",
    "therefore , the techniques presented in this paper can be applied to finite volume and discontinuous galerkin methods .      in this section",
    "we define the class of target functionals treated in this paper , state the corresponding adjoint problem and recall the classical error representation which we will later use for adaptive time step control .",
    "our objective is to estimate the error in a user specified functional @xmath90 , which can be expressed as a sum of weighted integrals over the domain @xmath31 and the outflow boundary @xmath91 .",
    "typical examples of such functionals are the lift or the drag of a body immersed into a fluid",
    ".    to simplify matters we consinder functionals of the following form : @xmath92 our purpose is to control the error @xmath93 in order to derive the classical error representation one linearizes the evolution equation satisfied by the error @xmath94 and works with the adjoint equation of the linearized error equation .",
    "thus we introduce an approximate jacobian @xmath95 of @xmath96 by @xmath97 note that @xmath98    in practice we linearize around the approximate solution .",
    "a direct calculation yields the following theorem :    [ theorem.error_representation ] suppose @xmath99 solves the adjoint problem @xmath100 then for all @xmath101 , the error in the target functional satisfies @xmath102    equivalently one can also define the adjoint solution via a variational formulation ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in @xcite tadmor",
    "proves the well - posedness of the adjoint problem  for scalar , convex , one - dimensional conservation laws .",
    "the key observation is that , if the forward solution @xmath50 has jump discontinuities , then due to the entropy condition the jump of the transport coefficient @xmath95 has a distinct sign .",
    "this makes it possible to follow the characteristics of the adjoint problem backwards in time .",
    "identity is the error representation which we discussed in the introduction and onto which we are going to base our adaptive strategy . by definition - of the residual @xmath103",
    ", the error representation may be decomposed as a sum over the cells and edges of inner products of the local residuals with the solution of our dual problem . due to galerkin orthogonality",
    ", we can subtract an arbitrary test function @xmath104 , which is very convenient when we derive local error estimates later on .",
    "the error representation is not yet suitable for time adaptivity , since it combines space and time components of the residual and of the difference @xmath1 of the dual solution and the test function .",
    "the main result of this section is an error estimate whose components depend either on the spatial grid size @xmath105 or the time step @xmath106 , but never on both .",
    "the key ingredient is a space - time splitting of based on @xmath107 projections .",
    "similar space - time projections were introduced previously in @xcite . here",
    "we adapt them to the finite element spaces used in the error representation .",
    "let @xmath108 be the space of polynomials of degree @xmath39 on @xmath109 and @xmath40 on @xmath33 .",

    "we obtain the following splitting of the error representation : @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the time - component and @xmath128 the space - component of the error representation @xmath129 .    in this paper",

    "the error representation assumes that the exact solution @xmath0 of the dual problem is available .",
    "this is , of course , not the case .",
    "all we can do is to compute an approximation @xmath140 of @xmath0 .",
    "an important question is in which space we should choose the approximation @xmath140 ( let us call this space @xmath141 ) .",
    "if we choose @xmath142 , then - due to galerkin orthogonality of the residual - the error representation would return zero .",
    "therefore , @xmath141 should not be contained in @xmath143 .",
    "there are essentially three approaches in the literature to compute an approximate solution to the dual problem .",
    "the first approach is to keep the polynomial degrees @xmath40 and @xmath39 fixed , but compute the solution to the dual problem on a finer grid @xmath144 .",
    "the second approach is to compute the dual solution using higher order finite elements and using projections to get @xmath104 : @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the projection from the higher order finite element space onto the test space @xmath38 .",
    "the third way is to compute a solution in the test space of the forward problem , which means to use the same order finite elements , and then do a higher order reconstruction @xmath147 .",
    "@xmath148    in the following , we describe a fourth approach , which avoids to approximate @xmath0 alltogether . instead , we approximate the spatial gradient @xmath149 .",
    "the remarkable fact is that this gradient satisfies a conservation law instead of a nonlinear transport equation , and its numerical approximation is therefore very robust in the presence of shocks . in the present paper",
    "we limit our presentation to first order schemes in one space dimension .",
    "our approach can be applied to the dual problem , if the forward problem is approximated by a first order dg method , or a finite volume method .",
    "the backward problem can then be computed by the same method as the forward problems .",
    "the generalization of our ansatz to higher order schemes is relatively straightforward in one space dimension .",
    "let us look at the details : due to galerkin orthogonality , the dual solution @xmath0 does not enter the error representation as such .",
    "instead , the relevant term is the difference of the dual solution and its projection to the finite element space , @xmath1 .",
    "using one of the three methods described above , one needs additional degrees of freedom to compute an approximation @xmath0 to the dual problem , and some computed information will never be used , since only the difference @xmath150 enters the error representation .",
    "therefore we suggest to compute the spatial gradient of the dual solution .    to illustrate our approach ( still in one spatial dimension ) , we assume that @xmath104 is the piecewise constant function satisfying @xmath151 for some given point @xmath152 ( e.g. the midpoint ) . expanding @xmath0 around @xmath153 , @xmath154 and using the adjoint equation , we obtain that @xmath155 \\partial_x \\varphi(x_0 , t_0 )         + o(h^{2}+k^2).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath156 and @xmath95 are assumed to be known , the only unknown function is @xmath157 .    in order to derive the differential equation which is satisfied by @xmath158 , we differentiate the adjoint equation , @xmath159 with respect to @xmath160 and",
    "obtain @xmath161 where @xmath162 .",
    "therefore it is not necessary to compute the approximations @xmath140 and @xmath104 of @xmath0 , but it is sufficient to compute an approximation @xmath163 of @xmath164 .    it is striking to note that the gradient @xmath165 actually satisfies a conservation law , - , instead of a linear transport equation , - . therefore , @xmath166 can be computed with the same algorithm as the forward problem , and in the same finite element space .",
    "this leads to an efficient and robust solver : for discontinuous @xmath95 , finite difference schemes for - may suffer from serious stability problems .",
    "due to their upwind nature , finite volume schemes for the conservation law - handle discontinuous coefficients easily .",
    "in work in progress , we are analysing the efficiency of the new approach in more detail , generalize it to higher order and several space dimensions , and study related issues like boundary conditions for compressible fluid flows .",
    "we will use this new approach in the numerical examples in section [ sec.applications ] .",
    "in this section we describe the strategy for adaptive time step control , define a suitable numerical experiment and present first numerical results which demonstrate the potential of this approach .      in many applications , there are canonical target functionals which are of great interest to the user , like the lift and drag in aerodynamics . in some cases",
    ", an error margin may be prescribed for a given application .",
    "in other cases , it is less clear which accuracy should be and can be provided by a numerical computation , and with reasonable resources . in the following , we suggest prototype strategies to deal with both situations , where the tolerance may be , or may not be , prescribed .",
    "many equally valid variants of these could be proposed , as well . as pointed out before",
    ", we focus on the time adaptation . for clarity of exposition",
    ", we therefore use uniformly refined spatial grids .    in the present paper , we only treat burgers equation . in a paper in preparation , we extend this to the euler equations of gas dynamics .",
    "we begin by computing the forward and the dual solution as well as the error estimator on a relatively coarse spatial grid ( @xmath167 ) .",
    "usually this spatial grid is much coarser than the grid we actually want to compute on . since we want to compute a solution with accuracy comparable to an explicit solution",
    ", we prescribe a uniform cfl number below unity in this first computation ( e.g. cfl=0.8 ) .    after evaluating the error representation , we have to take two decisions :    1 .   the refinement level @xmath168 of the next spatial grid . in some cases",
    "we will gradually increase the level by one .",
    "this careful approach may be important if it is not clear whether the dynamics of the solution is already captured on the present grid .",
    "in other cases ( including the example treated below ) , the time dynamics is already resolved very well on level @xmath167 , and we can immediately proceed to the finest grid level .",
    "2 .   the tolerance @xmath169 for the temporal component of the error , @xmath170 .",
    "the choice of @xmath169 will be based on assumptions of the asymptotic decay of the error .",
    "if , as in figure [ fig.burgers_1_etabar ] , the error decays to first order , then we may choose @xmath171 .",
    "now we adapt the timestep locally in order to equidistribute the error densities @xmath172 .",
    "recall from that @xmath173 and @xmath174 if the @xmath172 were already equidistributed with respect to @xmath175 , then they would satisfy @xmath176 now , instead of aiming at local error densities of @xmath177 , we target at an equidistribution of @xmath178 where @xmath179 is a given tolerance on grid @xmath180 .",
    "assuming once more that the time component of the error varies linearly with the time step , we compute the new timestep @xmath181 ( on level @xmath180 ) as @xmath182 using this new timestep distribution we perform a new computation on the finer spatial grid .",
    "note that due to the linear decay of the error with the timestep , often the new distribution has a similar number of timesteps as the previous one .",
    "if a total tolerance for the error , @xmath183 is prescribed , then the above loop is stopped once @xmath184 our experience so far is the following : already on very coarse grids , the method detects the areas of stationary and instationary flow quite well , and chooses the time steps accordingly .",
    "we would like to call the approach which combines with an implicit solver the _ adaptive , fully implicit strategy_. a possible drawback of this strategy is that it may lead to extremely small timesteps ( cfl @xmath185 ) when strong instationary waves pass the computational domain .",
    "therefore , in the second and third example , we restrict the time step size from below .",
    "when the equidistribution of the error suggests @xmath186 , we switch to an explicit solver with @xmath187 .",
    "this saves a considerable number of timesteps .",
    "we call this approach the _ adaptive , implicit / explicit strategy_.      now we set up an instationary test case , which is almost stationary , such that an implicit ( or implicit / explicit ) scheme might be superior to a fully explicit one . our choice is a perturbed stationary shock for burgers equation @xmath188 \\ ; \\mathrm{and } \\ ; t\\in[0,48].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the initial data and corresponding unperturbed solution are given by @xmath189 then we place a disturbance at the left boundary of the domain , which makes the stationary shock move . the new shock position as a function of time",
    "is given by @xmath190 where @xmath191    using characteristic theory , we can derive the perturbed left boundary condition , which is displayed in figure  [ fig.burgers_bsp3 ] .",
    "note that the magnitude of the first perturbation is about 1.5 percent of the shock strength and that of the second perturbation about 0.1 percent .",
    "the functional @xmath90 is a weighted mean value in space and time of the solution , @xmath192 where @xmath193 .",
    "note that the integration area completely covers the domain containing the shock .      since the adaptive strategy outlined in section [ sec.applications.strategy ] above depends on assumptions on the assymptotic behavior of the error",

    "there is no analytical result which shows how the error terms @xmath170 and @xmath194 depend on @xmath106 and @xmath105 .",
    "therefore , we estimate this dependence numerically . we compute the perturbed shock described in section  [ sec.applications.test_problem ] with a first order finite volume method with engquist - osher flux , which is equal to a dg(0,0 ) method",

    "we apply the adaptive scheme to a weak perturbation of a stationary shock .    already on a very coarse mesh of 20 points",
    "the error representation formula precisely gives the location and strength of the instationary perturbations .",
    "this can be translated into efficient timestep distributions , which respect a desired accuracy .",
    "we show that these timestep distributions can be applied successfully to much finer spatial grids .",

    "we show that it is sufficient to compute the spatial gradient of the dual solution , @xmath5 , instead of the dual solution @xmath0 itself .",

    "<S> we study a recent timestep adaptation technique for hyperbolic conservation laws . </S>",
    "<S> the key tool is a space - time splitting of adjoint error representations for target functionals due to sli@xcite and hartmann@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it provides an efficient choice of timesteps for implicit computations of weakly instationary flows . </S>",
    "<S> the timestep will be very large in regions of stationary flow , and become small when a perturbation enters the flow field . </S>",
    "<S> besides using adjoint techniques which are already well - established , we also add a new ingredient which simplifies the computation of the dual problem . due to galerkin orthogonality </S>",
    "<S> , the dual solution @xmath0 does not enter the error representation as such . </S>",
    "<S> instead , the relevant term is the difference of the dual solution and its projection to the finite element space , @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we can show that it is therefore sufficient to compute the spatial gradient of the dual solution , @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this gradient satisfies a conservation law instead of a transport equation , and it can therefore be computed with the same algorithm as the forward problem , and in the same finite element space . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the capabilities of the approach for a weakly instationary test problem for scalar conservation laws . </S>"
