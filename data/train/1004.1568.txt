    "the high temporal variability was one of the first properties to be attributed to the gamma - ray burst ( grb ) prompt emission in the @xmath0-ray energy band ( @xcite ) .",
    "the advent of _ swift _ ( @xcite ) revealed that a highly variable emission characterises also the early time x - ray afterglows in the form of erratic flares .",
    "this established the temporal variability as one of the key features in interpreting the grb phenomena .",
    "grb050502b and the x - ray flash 050406 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) provided the first examples of dramatic flaring activity superimposed to a smooth decay : in particular , grb050502b demonstrated that flares can be considerably energetic , with a 0.3 - 10 kev energy release comparable to the observed prompt fluence in the 15 - 150 kev band . thanks to the rapid re - pointing _ swift _ capability , it was later shown that flares are a common feature of the early x - ray afterglows , being present in the @xmath10 of x - ray light - curves ( @xcite , hereafter c07 ; @xcite , hereafter f07 ) . on the contrary , a convincing optical flare , counterpart to a detected x - ray flare is still lacking , suggesting that the detected optical afterglow contemporaneous to the high - energy flares is dominated by a different emission component ( see e.g. grb060904b , @xcite but see also @xcite where an optical flare was probably detected but , unfortunately , contemporaneous x - ray coverage is lacking ) .    based on the temporal and spectral study of a statistical sample of x - ray flares within grbs , c07 and",
    "f07 showed that the flares share common properties and that the flare phenomenology can be described using averaged properties ( see c07 and f07 and references therein ) :    * the same grb can show multiple flares ( see e.g. grb051117a which contains a minimum of 11 structures in the first 1 ks of observation ) ; * the underlying continuum is consistent with having the same slope before and after the flare , suggesting that flares constitute a separate component in addition to the observed continuum ; * each flare determines a flux enhancement evaluated at the peak time @xmath11 between @xmath12 and @xmath13 , with a fluence that competes in some cases ( e.g. grb050502b ) with the prompt @xmath0-ray fluence .",
    "the average flare fluence is @xmath14% the 15 - 150 kev prompt fluence ; * flares are sharp structures , with @xmath15 , a fast rise and a slower decay ; * each flare determines a hardening during the rise time and a softening during the decay time ( f07 ) , reminiscent of the prompt emission ( e.g. @xcite ) : the result is a hardness ratio curve that mimics the flare profile ( see e.g. grb051117a , @xcite , their figure 9 ) . in this sense flares are spectrally harder than the underlying continuum ; * the spectrum of a consistent fraction of flares is better fitted by a band ( @xcite ) model , similarly to prompt emission pulses ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the flare spectral peak energy is likely to be in the soft x - ray range ( a few kev ) .",
    "the spectrum evolves with time as testified by the hardness ratio curve and by accurate spectral modelling . during the decay time",
    "a clear softening is detected ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) ; * there is no correlation between the number of flares and the number of prompt emission pulses ; * the vast majority of flares are concentrated in the first 1 ks after trigger . however ,",
    "late - time flares ( @xmath16 s ) are present as well : flares are not confined to the steep decay phase , but can happen during the plateau and the normal decay phases .",
    "their temporal properties are consistent with those of early flares ( @xcite ) , even if their lower brightness prevents a detailed comparison with the entire set of early time flare properties ( this is especially true from the spectral point of view ) ; * flares happen both in low - z and high - z environments : the record holder grb090423 at z@xmath17 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) shows a prominent flare with standard properties when compared to the sample of x - ray flares of @xcite ( c10 , hereafter ) ;",
    "* flares have been detected both in hard and soft events such as x - ray flashes ( e.g. xrf050406 ) ; * variability has also been detected in the x - ray afterglows of _ short _ grbs ( grb with a prompt emission duration @xmath18 s , @xcite ) .",
    "however , given the lower brightness associated to these events it is still unclear if what is currently identified as a short grb flare emission , quantitatively shares the very same properties as the population of flares detected in _",
    "long _ grbs .",
    "grb050724 ( @xcite ) constitutes a good example of short grb with late - time variability .    from the systematic study of 113 flares in the xrt 0.3 - 10 kev energy band , as well as in 4 sub - energy bands",
    ", c10 demonstrated that :    * flares are asymmetric with an average asymmetry parameter similar to the prompt emission value ; no flare is found rising slower than decaying ; * the flare width evolves linearly with time @xmath19 .",
    "this is a key point which clearly distinguishes the flares from the prompt emission , where no evolution of the pulse - width has ever been found ( see e.g. @xcite ) ; * the width evolution is the result of the linear evolution of both the rise and the decay times : @xmath20 ; @xmath21 .",
    "* the asymmetry does not evolve with time .",
    "instead the rise over decay time ratio is constant with time , implying that both time scales are stretched of the same factor .",
    "furthermore @xmath22 .",
    "flares are _ self - similar _ in time . * at high energy the flares are sharper with shorter duration : @xmath23 .",
    "pulses share the same property , with a similar dependence on the energy band ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ; * the flare peak luminosity decreases with time .",
    "accounting for the sample variance the best fit relation reads : @xmath24 .",
    "the average flare luminosity declines as a power - law in time @xmath25 ( @xcite ) ; * the isotropic 0.3 - 10 kev flare energy distribution is a log normal peaked at @xmath26 erg ( this can be viewed as the typical flare isotropic energy ) .",
    "the distribution further shows a hint of bimodality . * in multiple - flare grbs ,",
    "the flares follow a softening trend which causes later time flares to be softer and softer : the emitting mechanism keeps track of the previous episodes of emission .    starting from these pieces of evidence , c07 , f07 and c10 concluded that in spite of the softness and width evolution , the x - ray flares and the prompt pulses are likely to share a common origin .",
    "however important questions are still to be addressed : do flares follow the entire set of temporal and spectral relations found from the analysis of prompt emission pulses ? in particular : is it possible to define a flare peak - lag ?",
    "do flares follow a lag - luminosity relation ?",
    "is the lag - time linked to other temporal properties ( e.g. the flare duration , asymmetry , etc . ) ?",
    "what can be said about the pulse start conjecture for flares ( @xcite ) ? is it possible to quantify the evolution of the flare temporal properties as a function of the energy band ?",
    "do the rise and decay times evolve differently with energy band ?",
    "is it possible to track and quantify the evolution of the spectral peak energy @xmath27 during the flare emission ? is there any connection between the temporal and spectral properties of the flares ?",
    "what is the position and the track of the flares in the @xmath28 ( spectral peak energy - isotropic luminosity ) plane ?",
    "is there any link between the flares and the underlying x - ray afterglow morphology ?",
    "this set of still open questions constitutes the major motivation for undertaking the present investigation .",
    "the primary goal of this paper is to model the x - ray flare profiles and constrain their evolution with energy to obtain parameters that uniquely qualify the shape and spectrum of the flares and compare those values to the well known signatures of the prompt emission pulses .",
    "since this is often difficult because of low statistics , overlap or non trivial estimate of the underlying continuum , the present work concentrates on very bright and isolated flares for which the underlying continuum does not play a major role neither from the temporal point of view nor from the spectral point of view .",
    "this work is observationally driven : a critical review of theoretical models in the light of the present results is in preparation .",

    "the required isolation allows us to constrain the flares temporal and spectral properties with high accuracy ; their brightness assures the possibility to analyse in detail the evolution of their temporal properties in different energy bands inside the 0.3 - 10 kev of the xrt ; at the same time , this requirement guarantees that the partial ignorance of the underlying continuum properties has a negligible impact on our conclusions , both from the spectral and from the temporal point of view .",

    "the choice of this sample introduces an obvious caveat in our analysis , namely , that we make the explicit assumption that the results we derive from the bright flares hold for all the flares .",
    "however , apart from the brightness , there is no evidence that our sample of bright flares is not representative of the entire population at the 80% c.l . as obtained by a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test .",
    "we therefore conclude that our results are likely to be extended to the entire population of x - ray flares .",

    "for the prompt pulses the relation reads : @xmath58 ( @xcite , but see also @xcite , n05 , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the width evolution results from the joint evolution of two time scales : the rise and the decay times .",
    "the evolution with energy of @xmath59 and @xmath60 is well described by a power - law , with power - law indices which are found to be very similar ( see table [ tab : energyevol ] ) : however , the very good statistics of our sample allows us to conclude that the _ rise _ time is more sensitive to the energy bandpass than the decay time .",
    "this is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : trisetdecayslope ] .",
    "since the evolution of the temporal parameters with energy band is strictly linked to the spectral evolution during the flare emission , this would point to some spectral differences between the rise and decay portions of the light - curve .",
    "in particular , the different relative position of the evolving @xmath61 with respect to the fixed energy bands during the @xmath59 and @xmath60 is likely to play a major role : this can be in turn a footprint of two different physical mechanisms dominating the rise and the decay phases .",
    "the first consequence of this finding is that each energy channel is only nearly an exact time - stretched version of the others : flares can be treated as self - similar in energy only at the 0th level of approximation . the second direct consequence is the presence of a slight trend pointing to more asymmetric flares at higher energy ( table [ tab : summaryenergy ] , fig .",

    "@xcite defining the asymmetry as @xmath62 found no evolution of this ratio with energy for grb prompt pulses : however , the separate evolution @xmath63 and @xmath64 was not calculated .    while the soft energy flare profiles are clearly broader and peak later , it is unclear if the flares start simultaneously at all energies .",
    "the pulse start conjecture was first proposed by @xcite and then tested by @xcite : these authors studied a sample of 199 prompt batse pulses in 75 different grbs using an automatic pulse fitting methodology .",
    "each pulse is modelled by a n05 profile ( the same profile used for flares ) .",
    "we caution that a strong coupling is built in the n05 profile between @xmath40 and @xmath65 : the two parameters are clearly related since both fit the flares before the peak .",
    "this translates in a non - negligible probability of obtaining a good fit with perfect @xmath66 but with non - physical @xmath40 and @xmath65 : any slight but systematic variation @xmath67 would be destroyed .",
    "the other 2 major problems are connected to the structure overlap and low statistics that affect part of the @xcite sample as discussed by the authors . in spite of these limitations",
    "the pulse start conjecture was concluded to hold for prompt gamma - ray pulses with an uncertainty of @xmath68 s. for the x - ray flares the situation is different : the selection of 7 isolated flares with very good statistics led to the conclusion that a slight trend for flare profiles at _ high _ energy to start _ later _ is present .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:060904b ] , panel _ l_. table [ tab : bestfit ] reports the start time values for the entire sample of bright flares : the high energy profile @xmath69 is always larger than the low energy @xmath69 : in 5 cases out of 7 the difference between the two values is significant at more than @xmath70 c.l .",
    "the flare emission preferentially builds up at lower energies at the beginning of the grb flares .",
    "figure [ fig : par_energy ] demonstrates that the rate of evolution of the temporal parameters with energy in a single flare can be markedly different from the average sample behaviour ( see the values reported in table [ tab : energyevol ] compared to those of table [ tab : summaryenergy ] ) .",
    "notably , this is directly linked to the observed flare spectral properties as proven by fig .",
    "[ fig : hr_evol_slope ] : the harder the flare , the lower is the detected rate of evolution of the flare profile in different energy bands . since _",
    "hard _ flares also display a _ limited _ spectral evolution in the 0.3 - 10 kev energy range ( insets of fig .",
    "[ fig : hr_rise_decay ] ) , ( likely because their @xmath61 lies outside the xrt energy band during the majority of the emission time ) , the result above implies a strict link between the spectral properties and the evolution of the temporal properties .",
    "the same is true when the flare peak lag is considered : in the case of the prompt emission , the cross - correlation lag between energy bands was shown to anti - correlate with the batse spectral hardness ratio by @xcite ; when _ pulses _ properties are considered instead of time integrated _ burst _ properties , the result is that the pulse spectral hardness anti - correlates with pulse lag and duration , and correlates with pulse intensity ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig : lag_hr ] demonstrates that x - ray flares share the same property : a trend is evident for flares with larger @xmath71 to have shorter peak lags .",
    "the lag - hardness correlation of this figure , together with fig .",
    "[ fig : hr_rise_decay ] again implies a robust connection between the flares temporal properties and their spectral evolution : a stronger spectral evolution directly translates into a higher lag .",
    "this means that the lag characterising the flares profiles is the direct result of their spectral evolution .",
    "the same conclusion was reached by @xcite for the prompt emission : these authors concluded that the fundamental origin of the observed lag is the evolution of the grb prompt spectra to lower energies .",
    "our results of fig . [ fig : hr_evol_slope ] extend this finding to other flare temporal properties : the rate of evolution with energy of the rise time , decay time and width is inversely correlated to the spectral hardness and directly linked to the spectral evolution .",
    "finally we mention that only soft flares have been found to be highly asymmetric ( fig .",
    "[ fig : par_hr ] , panel _ c _ ) .",
    "similarly @xcite found that soft prompt pulses are on average more asymmetric .",
    "-0.0 true cm     the flare peak lag is directly related to the flare duration ( table [ tab : summary ] , fig . [",
    "fig : obslag_corr ] ) and since @xmath72 has been found to vary inversely with the flare peak luminosity ( c10 , but see also the relation reported in table [ tab : summary ] ) , an inverse correlation between peak lag and luminosity is expected . since only three flares in our sample have measured redshift , we selected the flares with the best statistics , measured redshift and well defined peak times in both the hardest and softest xrt energy bands from the sample of c10 .",
    "figure [ fig : laglum ] confirms the expectation above , showing that the x - ray flares define a rather tight lag - luminosity relation : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the rest frame peak lag calculated as the difference in time between the flare peak times in the 0.3 - 1 kev and the 3 - 10 kev energy bands .",

    "it is not possible to constrain the spectral peak energy and the spectral slopes of the majority of the flares of c10 : for this reason we fitted the spectrum extracted around the peak time with an absorbed spl within xspec and conservatively quote the isotropic peak luminosity as obtained in the observed 0.3 - 10 kev bandpass ( black bullets in fig .",

    "the first fundamental relation expresses the concept that flares profiles tend to be self - similar both in energy and in time ( c10 ) : @xmath80 which implies : @xmath81 : the n05 profile contains a degree of freedom which is not required by the data , since the rising and decaying time scales are not independent from one another ; @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 . the pulse peak lag between two energy bands centered on @xmath85 and @xmath86 reads : @xmath87 since @xmath88 at the first level of approximation .",
    "@xmath89 directly inherits the energy dependence of @xmath46 and @xmath45 ( table [ tab : summaryenergy ] ) : @xmath90 where @xmath91 .",
    "this implies @xmath92 where @xmath93 is a factor of proportionality which depends on @xmath85 and @xmath86 . a lag - width correlation is consequently expected since @xmath94 ( or alternatively a @xmath95 or @xmath96 relations ) .",
    "the width - peak time linear correlation discussed by c10 , introduces the concept of temporal @xmath97 , which is the key to interpret the grb x - ray flare phenomenology : @xmath98 which automatically implies @xmath99 and @xmath100 ; considering the lag - width correlation of the previous paragraph , eq . [ eq : wtpeak ] translates into a lag - tpeak correlation .",
    "the third fundamental relation links the flare peak - lags to their peak - luminosities , in strict analogy to the prompt emission : @xmath101 consequently , @xmath46 , @xmath45 and @xmath72 will be linked to the flare peak luminosity . in turn , the peak luminosity is expected to evolve with time to lower values , as found : @xmath102 although with a large scatter .",
    "the fourth relation again describes the temporal _ evolution _ of the flare spectral properties : @xmath103 flares become softer and softer as time proceeds . as a result , an inverse @xmath104 , @xmath105",
    ", @xmath106 and @xmath107 relation is automatically built .",
    "this completes the set of 28 correlations ( or lack thereof ) of table [ tab : summary ] .",
    "an important implication is that at the 0th level of approximation , the physics underlying the flare emission determines that out of 3 time scales describing the flare temporal profile ( namely @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath108 ) , only one degree of freedom survives .    as a second level approximation",
    ", one should consider that @xmath109 ; @xmath110 which likely reflects the relative position of the spectral peak energy with respect to @xmath85 and @xmath86 ; @xmath111 since the rise and decay times evolution with energy band slightly differs from one another(fig .",
    "[ fig : trisetdecayslope ] ) . any theoretical model aiming at explaining the flare emission",
    "is asked to be consistent with these set of findings , together with the flare spectral properties discussed in the following paragraph .",
    "a critical revision of the existing models is in preparation .",
    "for the two flares with the highest statistics , we find that the flare spectrum is well described by an evolving band function . in both cases",
    "the spectral peak energy evolves with time to lower values following an exponential decay which tracks the decay of the flare flux .",
    "after @xmath108 the n05 profile is progressively dominated by the @xmath113 factor , with the relative strength of the @xmath114 dropping quickly .",
    "remarkably , in both flares , the temporal evolution of the spectral peak energy and the flux seem to share the same e - folding time : for the flare detected in grb060418 we have @xmath115 s with @xmath116 s ; for the grb060904b flare we find @xmath117 s in good agreement with @xmath118 s.    the evolution of @xmath112 to lower values during the pulse decay time is one of the signatures of the prompt emission as demonstrated by a number of studies ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein for a recent study on single prompt pulses ) .",
    "the spectral peak energy of prompt pulses is found to evolve following a power - law @xmath119 with an evolutionary slope @xmath120 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the observed evolution of the flare @xmath112 is instead much faster and inconsistent with the @xmath121 behaviour after rescaling the time to the beginning of the flare emission .",
    "taking the grb060904b flare which starts at @xmath122 s as an example , @xmath123 kev would imply @xmath124 kev if the @xmath121 behaviour is assumed : the observations instead constrain the @xmath125 to be well below the xrt bandpass , so that @xmath126 kev .",
    "while this could be the result of a wrong choice of the power - law zero time ( the relevant time could be the ejection time instead of @xmath127 , see @xcite for details ) , further investigations are required to establish if the faster @xmath112 evolution is a peculiar feature of the flare emission when compared to the prompt phenomenology .",
    "the spectral analysis of subsec . [ subsec : specmodeling ] allows us to constrain the properties of two x - ray flares in the @xmath130 and @xmath131 planes for the first time .",
    "figure [ fig : epeisoliso ] shows the result : when compared to the spectral properties of the prompt emission of 83 grbs with measured redshift and well constrained spectra ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , the two flares show higher @xmath2 and @xmath3 than expected starting from their rest frame spectral peak energy @xmath1 .",
    "if the flares are part of the prompt emission , then they are not expected to share the time integrated @xmath132 best fit normalisation : however , @xcite demonstrated that individual sequences of the same burst do follow the @xmath128 relation with a _ higher _ normalisation ( reflecting the fact that the total energy budget is distributed over the sequence , see @xcite , their fig .",
    "the opposite is observed for the two flares .",
    "the @xmath131 plane does not suffer from this effect , and time integrated properties can be here directly compared to their time resolved counterparts . in this plane",
    "the two flares are barely inside the @xmath133 best fit area : however , the peak luminosity is poorly sampled below @xmath134 and a deviation to lower spectral peak energies of the main sample can not be excluded since the best fit relation is mainly established by high luminosity data points . in this case",
    "the x - ray flares would belong to the same @xmath131 as the prompt emission .",
    "alternatively , and equally interesting , the flares do not follow the @xmath135 relation of the prompt data .",
    "this possibility is suggested by the fact that the two flares are outliers of the @xmath136 relation even when the effect of the time resolved spectral analysis is taken into account . whether this depends on the chosen integration energy band ( 1 - 10@xmath137 kev ) is currently under investigation .",
    "for grb060418 the spectral properties during the prompt emission were measured ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) : @xmath138 kev ; @xmath139 erg ; @xmath140 erg .",
    "the flare isotropic input comprises @xmath77% of the isotropic gamma ray prompt energy while the flare isotropic peak luminosity is @xmath141% the @xmath142 .",
    "the contribution of the flare emission is therefore well within the uncertainties estimated for the prompt parameters : this results helps to understand how much the unaccounted flare emission contributes to the scatter affecting the @xmath4 relation ( @xcite ) .",
    "the time resolved analysis of the two flares with redshift and bat detection reveals that the rest frame spectral peak energy @xmath1 correlates with the isotropic luminosity @xmath6 within single flares .",
    "the same has been demonstrated to be true for the prompt pulses : the _ time integrated _ correlations are the result of the existence of similar _ time resolved _ correlations of the same parameters .",
    "individual grb prompt pulses are consistent with the @xmath5 as proved by @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "our work proves that 2 x - ray flares share this property and that flares in general are likely to be consistent with this behaviour .",
    "the best fit slopes of the two relations of fig .",
    "[ fig : epeisolisotime ] are however steeper than the @xmath144 slope found for the prompt emission ( see e.g. @xcite ) : whether this is something peculiar of the flare emission or not , needs to be understood with a larger sample . at the moment we note that the best fit time resolved @xmath5 slope within single prompt pulses",
    "have been found to be different from the 0.5 value in some cases : see e.g. grb090323 and grb090328 in @xcite their fig .",
    "3 , where the @xmath5 track seems to be steeper than @xmath145 .    intriguingly , the spectrum extracted at the onset of the flare in grb060904b is a clear outlier , being characterised by an @xmath1 higher than expected : a similar result was found by @xcite for the prompt emission .",
    "these authors performed a time resolved spectral analysis of the grb061007 prompt emission and concluded that the _ initial _ rising phase of each pulse is an outlier of the @xmath5 relation , with @xmath1 around twice the value expected from the spectral correlation .",
    "however , no difference between the rise and decay portions of the prompt pulses has been reported by @xcite from the analysis of 2 _ fermi _ grbs .",
    "the presence of these spectral correlations during the flare emission tightly links the x - ray flare emission to the prompt phase ; as a by - product , these results strengthen the interpretation of the spectral energy correlations as manifestation of the physics of the grbs ( see @xcite and references therein for a detailed discussion of this topic ) .",
    "-0.0 true cm     the entire set of findings presented in this work establishes a strong link between early x - ray flares and prompt pulses .",
    "flares are consistent to be independent episodes of emission superimposed to the contemporary steep decay or afterglow components : while the first has been proven to be generated by the tail of the previous pulses ( @xcite ; see e.g. @xcite ) and is therefore related to the physical mechanism which gives rise to the prompt emission , the latter is likely to be a completely independent component ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray afterglows with no breaks are likely to be dominated by the afterglow component from the beginning of the xrt observations ( see @xcite for a dedicated study ) .",
    "we therefore expect the spl x - ray afterglows to show a limited flaring component if flares really constitute an independent component ( flares would be perhaps present but hidden by the contemporaneous afterglow emission ) .",
    "figure [ fig : flares_lctype ] confirms this expectation : the no - break class is clearly under - represented in the flare sample , while the vast majority of the detected early time flares reside in one - break or canonical x - ray afterglows . the probability that the two samples are drawn from the same population",
    "is evaluated to be as low as @xmath146% using a ks test .",
    "if this is due to the brightness of the afterglow emission , than the conclusion is that flares have an independent origin : in the standard scenario this means that flares are not produced by the external shock .",
    "another equally interesting possibility is that flaring emission is quenched ( instead of being hidden ) in spl - afterglow grbs .",
    "distinguishing between these two possibilities is beyond the scope of this work and will be the subject of a forthcoming investigation .",
    "-0.0 true cm ) . we stress that this is an _ average _ behaviour .",
    "the thick solid arrow underlines the dependence of the flare properties on the _ time _ , in strong opposition to prompt pulses .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    the grb x - ray flare phenomenology shows a list of properties strictly analogous to the gamma - ray prompt emission ( see @xcite for a recent study on individual prompt pulses ) .",
    "however , it differs in one crucial aspect : flares _ evolve _ with _ _",
    "time__. flares evolve with time to lower peak intensities , larger widths , larger lags and softer emission .",
    "[ fig : flareparadigma ] illustrates the flare paradigm . as the prompt emission pulses ,",
    "flares have correlated properties : short - lag flares have shorter duration , are more luminous and harder than long - lag flares . in particular the following properties add to the lists of sec .",
    "[ sec : introduction ] :    * flares define a lag - luminosity relation : + @xmath147 .",
    "the best fit slope is remarkably consistent with the prompt findings ( see @xcite and references therein for a recent study ) ; * the lag is found to correlate with the flares width while it is inversely correlated to the flare spectral hardness ; * the flares temporal profiles in different band - passes are only a nearly exact time stretched version of one another : the rise and decay times evolve following slightly different power - laws in energy : @xmath148 , @xmath149 with @xmath150 .",
    "the result is that flares are on average more asymmetric at high energy ; * the rate of evolution of a flare profile in different band - passes anti - correlates with its spectral hardness : the harder the flare the lower is the rate of evolution from one energy band to the other ; * the flare spectral peak energy @xmath151 evolves to lower values following an exponential decay which tracks the decay of the flare flux .",
    "the detected evolution is faster and inconsistent with the @xmath152 behaviour even when the zero time is re - set to the beginning of the flare emission ; * the two flares with best statistics show higher than expected @xmath2 and @xmath3 values when compared to the @xmath4 and @xmath5 prompt correlations ; * the rest frame spectral peak energy @xmath1 correlates with the isotropic luminosity @xmath6 within single flares , giving rise to a time resolved @xmath5 correlation ; * the flare emission preferentially builds up at lower energies : flares do not seem to be consistent with the pulse start conjecture ; * among the different types of x - ray afterglow light - curves , the simple power - law afterglows are under - represented in the flare sample .",
    "flares are preferentially detected superimposed to one - break or canonical light - curves .",
