    "these systems originate in the work of einstein @xcite to describe the motion of brownian particles .",
    "they arise in mathematical models for chemistry , physics , biology and other areas , when the cumulative effect of unresolved degrees of freedom must be incorporated into a model to ensure its physical relevance . under mild conditions on @xmath8 , the system ( [ a ] )",
    "is ergodic @xcite and has the unique invariant distribution @xmath9 , where @xmath10 .",
    "numerical methods for solving the equation ( [ a ] ) compute a discrete sequence of states @xmath11 by iteratively approximating the short time evolution .",
    "the error in the numerical solution is typically quantified in either a _ strong _ sense ( accuracy with respect to a particular stochastic path associated to ( [ a ] ) ) or by reference to an evolving distribution ( _ weak _ error , or error in averages ) ; the latter is the focus of this article .",
    "ideally , the discrete states are ultimately distributed in a way that is consistent with the invariant distribution , but for complex applications the introduction of error in the numerical process is inevitable . in this article",
    "we examine the asymptotic ( @xmath12 ) behavior of the weak error .    undoubtedly , the most common numerical method for solving ( [ a ] ) is the euler - maruyama method which approximates @xmath13 , @xmath14 , by the iteration @xmath15where @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 are i.i.d .",
    "random variables with the law @xmath20 for analysis of the weak error , one considers a finite time interval @xmath21 $ ] , with @xmath22 . the probability measure associated to ( [ a ] )",
    "is described by a probability density @xmath23 which evolves according to the fokker - planck equation @xmath24where @xmath25 is the adjoint ( in the @xmath26 sense ) of the generator for ( [ a ] ) which is defined by @xmath27the solution @xmath23 evolves from an initial probability distribution @xmath28 to the steady state @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath30 be a test function ( e.g. an element of the schwarz space of @xmath31 functions rapidly decaying at infinity ) .",
    "then average of @xmath30 at time @xmath32 may be taken to be @xmath33    the discretization scheme ( [ e ] ) may also be viewed as giving rise to an evolving probability distribution , and thus one may think of the iterates in ( [ e ] ) , @xmath11 , as being characterized by densities @xmath34 . if stepsize @xmath35 is used , then the average at time @xmath36 is given by @xmath37it is natural to compare ( [ av ] ) and ( [ av_d ] ) as a means of quantifying the error as a function of @xmath35 .",
    "we refer to this as the _ weak error_. for the euler - maruyama method it is known ( see , e.g. kp , gnt04 ) that @xmath38the landau notation means that the given quantity is bounded for @xmath0 by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a constant that is independent of the stepsize . a better way to write this is @xmath41since @xmath40 depends inherently on the time interval .",
    "this formula can be seen as a consequence of an asymptotic expansion of the weak error , as proposed by talay and tubaro @xcite .",
    "we note that @xmath40 also depends on the distribution of the initial state of the system , i.e. @xmath28 , as well as the particular observable , but we suppress these aspects in our notation .",
    "the asymptotic ( @xmath42 ) behavior of @xmath40 describes the performance of the numerical method for computing averages with respect to the invariant distribution . for the euler - maruyama method",
    ", one finds that @xmath40 is bounded as @xmath42 , thus one obtains first order approximation of averages both at finite time and in the long time limit .    in order to calculate averages in systems with complicated potentials and/or a large number of variables ,",
    "one often must perform numerical calculations with a very long time interval .",
    "it is then desirable to use as large a timestep as is reasonable in the interest of reducing the computational effort , which is typically quantified in terms of the number of force evaluations .",
    "weak first - order methods like euler - maruyama can be inefficient in practice . schemes such as the second order stochastic heun method kp , gnt04 can have greater efficiency : the stochastic heun method uses two evaluations of the force @xmath43 at each timestep , thus , in comparison to euler - maruyama , it must introduce less than about half the error at a given stepsize to be deemed superior .",
    "the alternative method discussed in this paper has been proposed in @xcite : @xmath44where @xmath45 and @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 are i.i.d .",
    "random variables with the law @xmath46 .",
    "this method is very similar in form to the euler - maruyama method ( [ e ] ) , and is as easy to implement , but the sums of successive random increments are not statistically independent , so the method is fundamentally non - markovian in nature .",
    "the scheme was motivated in @xcite by an analysis of langevin dynamics algorithms . in lms13 , the same method , along with some alternatives ,",
    "was further analyzed from the perspective of the invariant measure , providing a rigorous foundation for the statement that the error in long - time averaging computed using ( [ b ] ) is of order two , i.e. @xmath47the remarkable feature of this estimate is that the second order accuracy is achieved with only a single evaluation of the force at each timestep .",
    "however , the result of @xcite is essentially a formal analysis since it is based entirely on the analysis of the invariant distribution and the stationary fokker - planck equation",
    ". such an operator - based approach does not elucidate the progression from finite time averaging to infinite time averaging and , in particular , nothing is demonstrated in @xcite about the weak accuracy of the method . in this article , we address this issue , studying the way that the finite - time averages obtained using the numerical scheme ( [ b ] ) converge , as @xmath42 , to steady - states of the numerical method . to do this",
    ", we compute the talay - tubaro expansion at finite time and show that @xmath48then we demonstrate that @xmath49implying a _ superconvergence _ property in the long - time limit .",
    "moreover , we show that this convergence is exponential in @xmath32 .",
    "we note that there are several recent papers ( see @xcite and references therein ) , where the idea of modified differential equations is exploited in order to construct higher - order schemes for computing ergodic limits .",
    "this approach provides the possibility of modifying schemes which are of weak order one on finite time intervals to provide second order approximations in ergodic limits .",
    "however , such modified schemes require either to evaluate derivative of forces or to perform two force evaluations @xcite , i.e. , their computational cost is at least as high as for the heun scheme and substantially higher than for ( [ b ] ) . furthermore , although the theoretical approaches in our paper and in @xcite share some similarities , the results of @xcite are not applicable to the non - markovian approximation ( [ b ] ) and they do not also include an analysis demonstrating that the leading term in the error of their modified schemes goes to zero exponentially fast .",

    "for both the euler - maruyama scheme and heun s method we average over 32 realizations for each timestep that we consider .",
    "this was sufficient to resolve the error introduced by these discretization methods .",
    "however , the scheme proved to be sufficiently accurate that further computation was required to discern the leading error term , with the error at each timestep computed using 256 realizations to reduce the sampling error .",
    "the results show good agreement with the theory presented in section [ sec::main ] .",
    "the method demonstrates an order of magnitude improvement in the long - time error of averages compared to heun s method , while at the same time requiring half the cost ( in terms of force evaluations ) .",
    "in this article we have closed the gap in understanding between the typical weak error analysis of numerical discretization methods and the invariant measure accuracy of e.g. @xcite , demonstrating in particular that the non - markovian numerical integration method makes an exponentially rapid transition from first order weak accuracy to second order accuracy as @xmath261 .",
    "our results are confirmed in several numerical experiments , with the ultimate conclusion being that the scheme is typically superior to the euler - maruyama and heun s methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency for the purpose of averaging in the long term ( in the transient region , the other methods may of course be better , depending on the problem ) ."
