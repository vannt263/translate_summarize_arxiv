    "the purpose of this paper is to address the statistical structure of the amorphous solid state via a simple model of a three - dimensional vitreous medium consisting of covalently bonded atoms ( or low - molecular - weight molecules )  @xcite .",
    "we shall do so essentially analytically by making use of techniques drawn from the field of the statistical mechanics of systems having quenched randomness  @xcite .",
    "the model of vitreous media on which we shall focus is that introduced by goldbart and zippelius  @xcite , which takes as ingredients a thermodynamically large number of particles between which some large number of permanent random covalent bonds are introduced .",
    "the quenched randomness is encoded in the information describing which pairs of particles are covalently bonded ; the remaining ( annealed ) degrees of freedom correspond to the unconstrained positions of the particles and the orientations of the orbitals .",
    "this model exhibits a continuous equilibrium phase transition from the liquid state to the amorphous solid state when the density of introduced bonds exceeds a certain critical value .",
    "it is on the structure and heterogeneity of this state that we hope to shed some light .    as an example of the type of medium we have in mind ,",
    "consider networks formed by the polycondensation of @xmath0 molecules , during which @xmath1 is eliminated between pairs of hydroxyl ( oh ) groups on certain randomly selected pairs of @xmath0 molecules so as to form si ",
    "o  si bonds .",
    "the amorphous solidification of such media has been studied in many experiments ; we cite as an example those of gauthier - manuel et al .  @xcite . as it is our intention to develop a rather general model of random networks , and to focus on universal properties , it is not necessary for us to incorporate the specific details of the medium .",
    "for example , we shall not be accounting for the bond geometry associated with the so - called bridging oxygen atoms between the silicon atoms . in the model ,",
    "both types of si orbitals , those connected to hydroxyl groups and those connected to bridging oxygen atoms , will simply be referred to as orbitals .",
    "a second example of the type of media we have in mind is provided by amorphous silicon networks  @xcite , especially those in which hydrogen passivates bonds unconnected to other silicon atoms .",
    "the structural characterization of the vitreous state that we shall construct will be statistical in nature , reflecting the intrinsic heterogeneity of the environments that the constituent particles in vitreous media inhabit .",
    "it will take the form of a _ joint probability distribution _ characterizing the fraction of particles that are localized in the vitreous state , and will describe the spatial extent of the thermal fluctuations in their positions , the degree and character of the thermal fluctuations in the orientations of the orbitals that are capable of participating in covalent bonds , and the strength and nature of the correlations between the thermal fluctuations in the particle positions and the orbital orientations . moreover , rather than dealing with media having a specific architecture ( i.e. , a specific realization of introduced bonds ) , we shall consider an ensemble of architectures , all characterized by a common parameter governing the probability that a permanent chemical bond was formed between any pair of nearby orbitals .    a statistical description of an amorphous solid state has previously been developed and explored in the context of vulcanized ( i.e. , randomly permanently crosslinked ) _ macromolecular _ media  @xcite .",
    "this description , which addresses the distribution of spatial extents of thermal position - fluctuations ( i.e. , localization lengths ) has been confirmed by computer simulations  @xcite , and rather general , model - nonspecific arguments in favor of the broad applicability of the description have also been presented  @xcite . for any particular version of random media ( e.g. the macromolecular media of refs  @xcite or the vitreous media considered in the present paper ) , what determines the specific content of the statistical description of the amorphous solid state is the form of the random constraints that the permanent covalent bonding imposes , and the resultant form taken by the amorphous solid order parameter . in the present context of vitreous media , the constraints ,",
    "as we shall see below , are more intricate than they are in the macromolecular vulcanization context and , accordingly , the order parameter is more intricate and the statistical content more elaborate : it accounts not only for the heterogeneity ( i.e. , the distribution over the sample ) of positional localization lengths but also for the distribution of orbital - orientation thermal fluctuations , the strengths of the position - angle thermal fluctuation correlations , and the statistical correlations between these physical characteristics  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , in addition to introducing the model of random network forming media considered here , and formulating the question of the phase transition to ( and structure of ) the amorphous solid state via statistical - mechanical techniques , goldbart and zippelius made a simple variational mean - field theory for the amorphous solid state in which all particles shared a common localization length and all orbitals shared a common extent of their angular localization .",
    "the positional and angular localization parameters were then solved for , self - consistently , and it was found that , at a certain critical value of the density of formed bonds , a continuous transition to an amorphous solid state occurs , beyond which the inverse of the positional localization parameter grows continuously from zero .",
    "it was also found that , in response to the onset of positional localization , orientational localization of the orbitals sets in .",
    "owing to the restricted form of the variational hypothesis for the order parameter adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite , specifically that it did not allow for the possibility that only a fraction of the particles would become localized at the transition , the critical bond density was over - estimated in ref .",
    "( the correct critical density was , however , known from the linear stability analysis of the fluid state . )",
    "later work by theissen et al .",
    "@xcite , in addition to allowing for networks comprising particles of various valencies , cured the difficulty of the critical bond density , by broadening the variational hypothesis to allow for a localized fraction ( although it still only allowed for a single value for the positional and orientation localization parameters , and did not account for correlations between the thermal fluctuations of positions and orientations ) .",
    "what , then , is the nature of the amorphous solid state ? if the number of permanent random covalent bonds introduced between particles is smaller than a certain critical value then the effect of these bonds is to bind at least some of the particles into random permanent molecules of a variety of types ( varying in size and architecture ) , each of which , given sufficient time , will wander ergodically through the volume of the container , i.e. , the equilibrium state of the system is fluid .",
    "if , however , the number of bonds introduced is greater than the critical value then their effect is to bind a nonzero fraction of the particles into a _ macroscopically large disordered molecule _ that extends throughout the container , the remaining fraction of particles remaining disconnected from the macroscopic molecule and capable of wandering across the container , given sufficient time . by contrast , the particles that constitute the extensive molecule will be localized in the vicinity of random preferred spatial positions , about which their positions will undergo thermal fluctuations extending only over a limited spatial regime ( which will vary randomly in magnitude from particle to particle , reflecting the random architecture of the network ) , and these particles will confer a rigidity on the entire system , so that the equilibrium state of the system will no longer be fluid and will , instead , be solid .",
    "moreover , the orbitals attached to localized particles will exhibit most probable orientations , about which they will fluctuate thermally , the extent and nature of these fluctuations also varying randomly from orbital to orbital .",
    "in addition , the thermal fluctuations in the positions of the particles and the orientations of the bonds connecting them will be correlated , to an extent that varies randomly from particle to particle .",
    "the unconventional nature of this the amorphous solid state is worth emphasizing : ( i )  only a fraction of the particles will be localized ; ( ii )  the mean positions of the localized particles will be random , as will be ( iii )  the spatial extent of the positional fluctuations of the particles , ( iv )  the orientational fluctuations of the orbitals , and ( v )  the correlations between these fluctuations ( these parameters being characterized by a joint probability distribution ) ; and ( vi )  there will be no hint of crystallinity beyond the shortest of lengthscales ( i.e. , the bond length ) , beyond these lengthscales the symmetries of the amorphous solid state being those of the liquid state .",
    "our principal aims are to construct a statistical characterization of the structure and heterogeneity of the amorphous solid state exhibited by a model of permanently randomly bonded vitreous media in the vicinity of the solidification transition , and to provide a physical interpretation of this characterization .",
    "we shall do this by constructing the self - consistency equation for the amorphous solid order parameter , valid in the vicinity of the solidification transition , and obtaining an exact solution of this self - consistent equation .",

    "@xcite , which takes as its ingredients a thermodynamically large number @xmath2 of particles , moving in a large three - dimensional cube of volume @xmath3 ( on which we impose periodic boundary conditions ) , at least some of which particles are permanently randomly bonded together to form a random network . at the kinematic level ,",

    "for example , in the absence of any external perturbing forces , all things being equal , the orbitals of a four - orbital particle would point towards the vertices of a regular tetrahedron , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : legs_str](a ) . rather than",
    "give a detailed specification of the interactions that embody this orbital - orbital repulsion , we shall encode the effects of such interactions into a sequence of parameters that characterize the correlations between the orientations of the orbitals of a single particle .",
    "for example , we shall find ourselves needing the correlator of the orientations of two _ distinct _ orbitals ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) of a single particle ( in the fluid state ) , say the @xmath12 : @xmath13 which we have parametrized in terms of the real numbers @xmath14 ( with @xmath15 ) that reflect the extent to which the orbitals interact  @xcite .",
    "the angle brackets @xmath16 , which we discuss below in sec .",
    "[ sec : partfunc ] , denote thermal averaging with respect to a the single - particle hamiltonian , which incorporates the intra - particle interactions .",
    "the form of this correlator follows from the isotropy of the distribution of the orbital orientations in the fluid state .",
    "we shall not find ourselves making explicit use of the correlator of the orientations of _ three _ distinct orbitals of a single particle .",
    "however , a simple symmetry - dictated form for it can readily be constructed , by making use of wigner  3-@xmath9 technology , if one wishes to compute explicitly components of the order parameter that depend on it .",
    "having described the issue of a single particle and its orbitals , we now turn to the issue of the permanent random covalent bonds between pairs of particles , and how we are to describe them .",
    "we regard such bonding as introducing constraints on the relative location and relative orientation of the particles and orbitals participating in the bond .",
    "specifically , we model the situation in which particles @xmath9 and @xmath17 are bonded via orbitals @xmath18 and @xmath19 by the constraints    @xmath20    as shown in fig .  [ fig : legs_str](b ) .",
    "we denote by the number @xmath21 and the collection @xmath22 a specific realization of @xmath21 bonds ( i.e. a specific architecture ) .    of course , the particles in the fluid interact with one another , regardless of whether or not bonds have been introduced .",
    "we shall assume that pairwise interactions , depending on the relative separation and orientation of the orbitals , exist between all particles",
    ". the crucial consequence that we assume these interactions to have is that they stabilize the system with respect to the formation of macroscopically inhomogeneous or anisotropic states , such as regular crystalline , liquid crystalline , molecular crystalline or globular states .",

    "it is via this component of the order parameter that the most direct contact is made with the edwards - anderson order parameter for heisenberg spin glasses , which detects the random orientational freezing of magnetic moments .",

    "the third category of information results from examining the components of the order parameter corresponding to nonzero values of both @xmath26 and @xmath40 .",

    "_ inter alia _ , such components address the question : if a certain particle is strongly localized positionally , how likely are the attached orbitals to be strongly localized orientationally",
    ".    next , consider the general case in which some replicas @xmath41 have nonzero values for both @xmath43 and @xmath42 .",
    "such components provide information on the extent to which positional and orientational _ thermal _ fluctuations are correlated .",
    "for example , as is discussed in more detail below , by setting @xmath45 in all replicas @xmath41 except replicas @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and by also setting @xmath48 , and @xmath49 in the remaining replicas @xmath41 , we would obtain access to the disorder average of the quantity @xmath50 which is a direct measure of the extent of the above - mentioned position - angle fluctuation correlations .",
    "let us pause to emphasize the three levels of randomness presented by random network forming media .",
    "there is _ thermal _ randomness , by which we mean the familiar thermal motion of the particles and orbitals .",
    "then there is _ architectural _ randomness , resulting from the random manner in which covalent bonds are formed .",
    "finally , there is _ microstructural _ randomness , i.e. , the heterogeneity of the emergent solid state .",
    "this last level of randomness we capture statistically in a joint probability distribution that characterizes the nature of the thermal motions .      the most basic piece of information describing the amorphous solid state concerns the value of the fraction @xmath51 of the @xmath2 particles that are localized positionally , regardless of the value of their localization lengths and the angular localization of the orbitals attached to them .",
    "as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , this fraction @xmath51 can be accessed via the order parameter  ( [ eq : nzrop ] ) in the following way : set @xmath52 for @xmath53 , and then pass to the limit @xmath54 via a sequence for which @xmath55 .",
    "the resulting quantity _ is _ the fraction @xmath51 .",
    "the reason for this is that whereas the value of @xmath56 at @xmath57 is strictly unity , the limiting value of @xmath58 ( as @xmath59 ) is unity for positionally localized particles , but zero for delocalized particles . for the sake of convenience",
    ", we shall refer to the localized fraction @xmath51 as the solid fraction , and the delocalized fraction @xmath60 as the liquid fraction .      to further elucidate the physical information regarding the positional and orientational localization of the particles and orbitals contained in the order parameter",

    "first , we consider the @xmath62 particles in the delocalized fraction . for such particles we have @xmath63 . for the remaining @xmath64 localized particles we first extract from the expectation value  ( [ eq : onepart ] ) the phase factor associated with the mean position @xmath65 of the particle , to obtain @xmath66 , and then express the resulting quantity in terms of disconnected and connected pieces : @xmath67    = 2.8 in    0.5truecm    on the right hand side of this expression , the disconnected ( i.e. , the first ) piece contains two factors : ( i ) @xmath68 , which describes the positional localization of the particle ( see fig .",

    "if we approximate the first factor in the connected piece by making use of the standard cumulant expansion , by letting @xmath70 denote the ( finite ) mean square fluctuations @xmath71 in the position of the particle , and by following this strategy to second order , then we arrive at the approximation @xmath72    = 2.8 in    0.5truecm    as for the connected ( i.e. , the second ) term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : corr1 ] ) , it describes correlations between the fluctuations in the particle position and the orbital orientation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fluc_cor ] ) . in the same way that we have introduced the diagnostic @xmath73 to characterize positional localization ,",
    "we now introduce two further diagnostics :    @xmath74    the collection of complex - valued numbers @xmath75 characterizes the orientational localization of orbital @xmath18 on particle @xmath9 ; the collection of complex - valued functions @xmath76 characterizes the correlations between the thermal fluctuations in the position of particle @xmath9 and the orientation of orbital @xmath18 attached to it . for example , consider @xmath77 . by expanding the exponential to first order ( as we shall establish later , typical values of @xmath78 are small near the transition ) , and recalling ,",
