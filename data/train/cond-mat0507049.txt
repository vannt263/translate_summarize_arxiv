    "<S> quantum turbulence ( qt ) consisting of quantized vortices has become a great subject not only for investigating the issues of superfluidity in the proper field of low temperature physics but also for studying a prototype much simpler than conventional classical turbulence ( ct ) . </S>",

    "<S> the energy , injected into the fluid at some large scales in the energy - containing range , is transferred in the inertial range to smaller scales without been dissipated . in the inertial range the energy spectrum takes the kolmogorov law @xmath0 here the energy spectrum @xmath1 is defined as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the kinetic energy per unit mass and @xmath4 is the wave number from the fourier transformation of the velocity field . the energy transferred to the energy - dissipative range </S>",

    "<S> the kolmogorov constant @xmath7 is a dimensionless parameter of order unity .    </S>",
    "<S> the inertial range is believed to be sustained by the self - similar richardson cascade process , in which large eddies are broken up to smaller eddies through reconnections . </S>",
    "<S> however , the richardson cascade has never been confirmed clearly in ct , because it is impossible to definitely identify each eddy . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , quantized vortices are definite and stable topological defects with the quantized circulation , consequently qt may give us a prototype of turbulence much simpler than ct @xcite . some experimental @xcite or theoretical works </S>",
    "<S> @xcite studied the kolmogorov law for qt , but it was very difficult to control the energy dissipation rate @xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> recently we made the numerical simulation of the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation which describes a quantum fluid at zero temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we introduced a dissipative term that works only in the smaller scales than the healing length , in order to remove compressible short - wavelength excitations created through vortex reconnections which may hinder the cascade process . </S>",
    "<S> we thus obtained the kolmogorov spectrum for decaying turbulence starting from the random configuration of the velocity field . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we also inject energy into the fluid at large scales by moving the random potential , thus obtaining steady turbulence sustained by the balance of the injection and dissipation of the energy . </S>",
    "<S> the energy spectrum of the incompressible kinetic energy still takes the kolmogorov law , and the energy flux @xmath6 is almost independent of the scales in the inertial range and consistent with the energy dissipation rate in the energy - dissipative range . </S>",
