    "the rapidly oscillating ap stars ( roap ) are a subclass of the magnetic a stars that pulsate in high order , low - degree modes ( see review by kurtz 1990 ) .",
    "much of our knowledge about the pulsations in roap stars have come from photometric studies since the short periods of the oscillations ( 515 min ) make it difficult to accumulate the high quality spectral data needed for radial velocity studies .",
    "recently , radial velocity measurements have been made on several roap stars and these are starting to yield exciting results .",
    "= 14truecm    early investigations concentrated merely on detecting radial velocity ( rv ) variations in roap stars primarily to confirm that pulsations were indeed responsible for the photometric variations and to measure the rv amplitude - to - photometric amplitude ratio ( 2@xmath5/@xmath6 ) which is useful for comparing to values derived for other pulsating stars .",
    "the first succesful attempt at measuring the pulsational rv for an roap star was done for hr 1217 by matthews et al .",
    "the estimated 2@xmath5-amplitude for this star over the wavelength interval 4350  4500  was about 400 which yielded a 2@xmath5/@xmath6 of 59@xmath712 mag@xmath8 , a value comparable to that found in cepheid - type variable stars .",
    "there was evidence that the rv amplitude varied with rotational phase since observations made on the previous night showed no significant rv variations above an amplitude of 130 .",
    "belmonte et al . ( 1989 ) detected rv oscillations in hr 1217 with a frequency of 2.72 mhz and an amplitude of 258 @xmath7 60 this yielded a 2@xmath5/@xmath9@xmath10 of @xmath0 190 mag@xmath8 , significantly higher than the matthews et al .",
    "( 1988 ) result .",
    "rv measurements at much higher rv precision using a self - calibrating iodine absorption cell were subsequently made for two other roap stars .",
    "libbrecht ( 1988 ) measured an rv amplitude of about 42 in @xmath11 equ based on observations spanning the wavelength interval 5322  5377 .",
    "this resulted in 2@xmath5/@xmath6 = 26 mag@xmath8 .",
    "hatzes & krster ( 1994 ) placed an upper limit of 23 to any rv variations of the roap star @xmath12 cir based on spectral data spanning the wavelength interval 5365  5410  .",
    "this yielded 2@xmath5/@xmath6 @xmath13 10 mag@xmath8 .",
    "more detailed studies of roap stars have established that the pulsational rv behavior for these stars can be quite complex with measured rv amplitudes differing by factors of 10100 for the same star depending on the spectral region that is examined .",
    "in contrast to the low amplitude measured by hatzes & krster ( 1994 ) , baldry et al .",
    "( 1998 ) measured the rv pulsational amplitude for @xmath12 cir and found that this was as high as 1 in some spectral regions .",
    "furthermore , those spectral regions dominated by strong lines had a lower pulsational rv amplitude than weaker spectral lines .",
    "kanaan & hatzes ( 1998 ; hereafter paper i ) presented rv measurements for @xmath11  equ derived using a number of spectral lines which showed that the pulsational rv amplitude depended not only on line strength , but on atomic species as well . since weaker spectral lines are formed , on average , deeper in the stellar atmosphere the amplitude variations found in paper i were interpreted as an atmospheric height effect resulting from a radial node situated in the stellar atmosphere .",
    "the line - by - line rv measurements for @xmath11  equ with more limited temporal and wavelength coverage by kochukov & ryabchikova ( 2001 ) confirmed the strong dependence of pulsation amplitudes from atomic species and phase differences for different elements and stages of ionization .",
    "in retrospect these large variations in the measured value of 2@xmath5/@xmath9 m in roap stars are not surprising . mkrtichian ( 1992 )",
    "first noted that the spotty distribution of elements on roap stars would greatly affect the measurement of the rv amplitude and consequently the rv - to - photometric amplitude ratio .",
    "a 2@xmath5/@xmath9 m determination for roap stars would be meaningless since it would depend on the spectral lines used for the rv determination .",
    "this seems to be confirmed by recent rv studies of these stars .",
    "baldry et al . ( 1998 ) found that approximately 15% of the wavelength bands they examined in @xmath12 cir showed a 180@xmath1 phase shift to other bands .",
    "one explanation of such a bi - modal distribution is a horizontal node effect due to the inhomogeneous surface distribution of elements ( mkrtichian 1992 , 1994 ) .",
    "alternatively , this bi - modal distribution in phases can result from different lines pulsating in opposite phases across a vertical atmospheric radial node ( baldry et al .",
    "the later is consistent with the amplitude variations in line strength found by kanaan & hatzes ( 1998 ) and the decline in photometric amplitude with increasing wavelength ( medupe & kurtz 1998 ) .",
    "although these studies are suggestive of the presence of such a wave , this is not conclusive .",
    "furthermore it may be difficult to disentangle the effects of the vertical standing waves to those due to the horizontal surface amplitude distributions of non - radial pulsations ( nrp ) .",
    "mkrtichian et al .",
    "( 2000 ) suggested separating the horizontal and vertical atmospheric effects by using spectral lines that are formed at different atmospheric heights and that have a different horizontal abundance distribution across the stellar surface .",
    "understanding the pulsations in roap stars is indeed challenging , but the rewards may be great in that we could derive important information about the 3-dimensional structure ( vertical and horizontal ) of the pulsations .",
    "rv measurements will play a key role in such studies .",
    "we have started a program to use precise rv measurements to study the pulsations in roap stars .",
    "this program has already detected `` broad - band '' ( i.e. computed over a large wavelength range ) rv variations in the roap stars hd  134214 , hr  1217 ( hatzes et al .",

    "a line - by - line analysis using high resolution ( @xmath14 ( = @xmath15/@xmath16)@xmath17 45,000 ) data covering a wide wavelength range has been made for relatively few roap stars .",
    "if we are to understand the influence of the magnetic field , surface distribution of elements , and atmospheric structure on the characteristics of the pulsational rv variations then we must make these kinds of measurements for more of roap stars spanning the available parameter space covered by these stars .",
    "here we present a time series of precise rv measurements , both broad - band and line - by - line , for the roap star 33 lib .",
    "33 lib ( = hd 137949 ) is a cool ap star with an effective temperature of 7350 k ( ryabchikova et al . 1999 ) that has been classified earlier as a cr - si - eu star .",
    "an effective magnetic field strength of @xmath0 @xmath181600 gauss has been measured for this star which is only slightly variable ( van den heuvel 1971 ; wolff 1975 ) .",
    "mathys et al .",
    "( 1997 ) combined their data and all other available magnetic field measurements for this star and found evidence for a slow increase in the longitudinal field component at a rate of @xmath19 20 g yr@xmath8 which implied a rotational period @xmath17 75 years .",
    "the roap status for this star was established by kurtz ( 1982 ) who found a pulsational period of 8.272 min ( @xmath20=2.01482 @xmath21 ) .",
    "this star pulsates in essentially one mode , although kurtz ( 1991 ) found evidence for a second frequency at 1975 @xmath22hz which has yet to be confirmed . that work also detected the second harmonic at 2@xmath20 = 4.02956 @xmath21 .",
    "belmonte et al . (",
    "1989 ) attempted to search for rv variations in 33 lib using a fabry - perot interferometer and a stellar line at 5317  . using more than 6 hours of data they found a peak in the power spectrum at the appropriate frequency and with an amplitude of 310",
    "; however , due to the high noise level in the power spectrum this result was uncertain .",
    "observations of 33 lib were made using the 2-d coud spectrograph ( tull et al .",
    "1995 ) of the 2.7-m telescope at mcdonald observatory on the night of 26 july 1997 between 3:15 ut and 5:26 ut . one focus of the instrument provides a resolving power @xmath14 ( = @xmath15/@xmath23 ) = 60,000 with a nominal wavelength coverage of 400010,000  in one exposure when used with a tektronix 2048@xmath242048 ccd detector . because of the short pulsation period of 33 lib it was necessary to minimize the time between successive exposures .",
    "this was accomplished by binning the ccd by a factor of two perpendicular to the dispersion direction .",
    "this halved the detector readout time without sacrificing spectral resolution .",
    "a further reduction in readout time was accomplished by framing the ccd so as to record only those pixels on the detector covering the spectral range 4700  7000  .",
    "this binning and framing of the ccd resulted in a dead time of 15 secs ( ccd readout and data storage ) .",
    "exposure times were 50 secs resulting in a full duty cycle of 65 secs .",
    "observations were made continuously one after another resulting in 86 independent observations .",
    "radial velocities were first computed using each full spectral order as these provided the best rv precision and resulted in a fast determination of the mean rv amplitude over a broad spectral region .",
    "figure  [ fig : dft ] shows the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) for the rv measurements from each of the spectral orders .",
    "the fundamental period , as marked by the vertical dotted line , is present in every spectral order except the one spanning 5878  6080  .",
    "the measured rv frequencies are all consistent , to within the measurement errors , with the published photometric one . in the analysis that follows",
    "we will assume that the 8.272 min period ( @xmath25 = 2.0148 mhz = 174.08 cd@xmath8 ) is the only one that is present in all the spectral orders .",
    "a least squares sine fit was made to the rv amplitude in each spectral order keeping the period fixed at 8.272 min .",
    "precise stellar radial velocity measurements were made using an iodine absorption cell placed just before the entrance slit of the spectrograph during each observation .",
    "this technique is commonly used for measuring precise relative stellar radial velocities and a description of the it can be found elsewhere in the literature ( cochran & hatzes 1994 ; butler et al .",
    "1996 ) . a description of the rv analysis techique as applied to roap stars can be found in hatzes & krster ( 1992 ) .",
    "molecular iodine has useful lines in the wavelength range of 50006300  ( 14 spectral orders ) which dictated the sub - framing of the ccd detector .",
    "the pulsational amplitude ranged from a low of 7 in the spectral order centred on 5928 to a high of 57 in orders centred on 5728 and 5456 .",
    "it is also clear from figure  [ fig : dft ] that the pulsational amplitude is not a simple function of wavelength .",
    "( we caution the reader that the spectral order whose central wavelength is 5928  is contaminated by a plethora of atmospheric water lines and these may affect the rv amplitude derived from the full spectral order . )",
    "= 14truecm    = 14truecm    = 14truecm    = 14truecm    to understand the rv pulsational behavior of 33 lib as a function of atomic species and line strength we performed an rv analysis on individual spectral lines .",
    "the rich spectrum of iodine absorption lines enabled us to do so .",
    "radial velocities were determined over a spectral region containing only a single line .",
    "care was taken to select only unblended lines , although in some cases our analysis was performed on slightly blended lines for which the major contribution to the equivalent width came from one feature . because of the increased noise level in the rv measurements of individual lines , it was often the case that the dominant peak in the fourier transform was not always coincident with the photometric frequency . in these instances",
    "the statistical significance of the highest peak was assessed using the procedure outlined in scargle ( 1982 ) and horne & baliunas ( 1986 ) . of those peaks which did not coincide with the photometric frequency",
    ", none were found to be statistically significant ( the false alarm probability was always greater than 10% ) .",
    "thus our line - by - line analysis did not show any conclusive evidence for the presence of an rv frequency that differed from the dominant photometric frequency ( @xmath20=2.0148 mhz ) .",
    "table 1 lists the least squares rv amplitude and relative phases ( as a fractional pulsation period ) of maximum rv amplitude .",
    "the relative pulsation phase was calculated using the time of rv maximum from a least squares fit that was phased with respect to the time of the first observation ( @xmath26 = 2,450,655.6383 ) . in this convention phase 0.88",
    "is near rv maximum .",
    "there appears to be significant phase variations for all spectral features that were measured along with a tentative line identification when possible . in our paper line identification",
    "were carried out based on line - lists of the vienna atomic line data base ( vald ) ( piskunov et al .",
    "1995 ) , line - list for roap star hd 122970 ( ryabchikova et al .",
    "2000 ) and a line - list for przybylski s star ( cowley & mathys 1998 ) .",
    "the blends are marked in table 1 by asterix and their wavelengths and identifications are listed below the primary line .",
    "a major goal of this line - by - line analysis is to develop an approach for deriving both the horizontal and vertical structure to the pulsations .",
    "the horizontal effects can be studied if we have a knowledge of the surface distribution of elements on the star .",
    "it is well known from doppler imagery that non - oscillating ap stars have elements that are inhomogeneously distributed over the stellar surface ( hatzes 1991 ; rice & wehlau 1991,1994 ) .",
    "if an element is concentrated in a localized spot , then the cancellation effect for non - radial modes will be smaller for the rv variations from this element .",
    "such a `` periodic spatial filter '' can be used to derive additional information about the ( @xmath27 ) quantum numbers of the nonradial modes ( mkrtichian 1994 ) .",
    "unfortunately , no doppler image exists for 33 lib due to long rotation period and there has been no rotational modulation of spectral features reported for this star .",
    "thus we do not even have crude knowledge as to how elements are distributed on this star .",
    "the study of any vertical structure to the pulsations requires that the acoustic amplitude and phases of a spectral lines be linked to a geometrical depth in the atmosphere .",
    "however , unlike for normal stars the effective optical depth of formation of a spectral line can not be easily linked to a geometric depth in the atmosphere of a roap stars .",
    "the inhomogeneous distribution of elements both horizontally and possibly vertically , as well as the presence of strong magnetic fields complicates the relationship between optical and geometric depths in roap stars . the optical depth calculated under simple assumptions ( e.g. no magnetic fields , no vertical stratification , etc . )",
    "may be considered as a very approximate depth scale for the study of vertical atmospheric cross - sections .    as a first approach we decided to link the equivalent widths of the fe spectral lines , @xmath28 , with an optical depth , , of the line formation and",
    "use this scale for estimating the phase and amplitude distributions throughout the atmosphere .",
    "for this approximate scale we assumed that there is no vertical stratification of fe and other elements in the atmosphere of 33 lib .",
    "this stratification may indeed be present as has been suspected for several elements in ap stars ( babel & lanz 1992 ; ryabchikova et al . 2002 ) . lacking any knowledge of such stratification in 33 lib this approach seems reasonable at least for fe since this element is non - peculiar and has approximately a solar abundance in roap stars ( ryabchikova et al .",
    "this scale for fe will be used as the standard scale for comparison with acoustic cross - sections using calculated scales of other elements .",

    "the equivalent width is a measured quantity , thus the @xmath5@xmath28 , @xmath35@xmath28 plots are model independent . on the other hand",
    "the calculated optical depth is dependent on the assumptions used in the model atmosphere . because roap stars have large magnetic fields , peculiar abundances , and inhomogeneous temperature and abundance profiles , both horizontally and vertically , the uncertainties in the calculation are larger than for normal stars .",
    "the @xmath28  mapping could change drastically with improved modeling .",
    "for this reason we show figures using both @xmath28 and as the ordinate .",
    "= 8.5truecm    = 8.5truecm    there appears to be a weak increase in the pulsation amplitude with decreasing @xmath28 and increasing for fe lines .",
    "however , the weaker lines also tend to have much larger errors in the amplitude measurement .",

    "rare earth elements are known to show the largest abundance anomalies and peculiarities in the atmospheres of ap stars .",
    "due to strong blending in 33 lib the number of available unblended or partially blended rare earth elements ( ree ) lines was limited for our analysis ( see table 1 . ) figure  [ fig : rest ] shows the amplitude ( left and right upper panels ) and phase ( left and right bottom panels ) variations respectively for gd  ii , er  ii , la  ii , ce  ii ree elements , and ni i , cr ii and ca i lines .",

    "the er  ii 5454.27  line shows the largest pulsation amplitude of 497 m / s ( s / n=2.54 ) among measured lines .",
    "again , similar to fe lines , large errors in the amplitude determinations and small number of lines of ree , ni , cr ii and ca i lines prevents us from extracting reliable information about the amplitude dependence with equivalent width .",

    "there is also the distinct phase jump of @xmath36 @xmath3 0.4 at @xmath0 @xmath41.3 that may be related to a similar phase jump at @xmath0 @xmath40.9 for the fe lines .",
    "if both phase jumps are located at the same geometrical depth in the stellar atmosphere ( most likely ) then the difference @xmath9",
    "@xmath0 @xmath40.4 in optical depths may be attributed to the distortion of scale due to different spatial ( horizontal and vertical ) abundance distributions of ree .",
    "we identified a sufficient number of nd lines to be able to separate these between singly and doubly ionized species .",

    "again , large rms amplitude scatter for weak nd  ii line prevents us from drawing reliable conclusions about the amplitude changes versus the depth in atmosphere .",

    "all lines had comparable rv comparable amplitudes and their phases were consistent to within @xmath70.005 of pulsation period .",

    "if we assume the same ratio of amplitudes of the first and second harmonic for the rv , then the expected rv amplitude of the second harmonic should be about 24  below our detection limits using radial velocities measured from the strong nd iii lines .",

    ".    the lower right panel of figure  [ fig : ndewt ] shows an obvious discrepancy in the of nd ii and nd iii features .",
    "both ionized species have a comparable range of optical depth , yet their pulsation phases are antiphase .",
    "this can not be the case if both species were formed at the same depth in the atmosphere .",
    "this discrepancy can be resolved if the strong nd iii lines were in fact formed much higher in the stellar atmosphere and their calculated ( under simplified assumptions about homogeneous vertical elemental distribution ) approximate optical depths are essentially overestimated .",
    "normally , we expect the second ionized species to form in the deep atmospheric layers where the temperature is high or in the outer layers where the pressure is low .",
    "the @xmath35 ",
    "@xmath41 diagram ( lower left of figure  [ fig : ndewt ] ) argues for the former .",
    "however , if nd iii lines are indeed formed at much higher layers then this could explain the differences in pulsational phase between nd ii and nd iii and points to the existence of a standing acoustic wave with a node in the upper atmosphere .",

    "the phases of the individual lines have a mean standard deviation of 0.09 which is consistent with the width of the smaller gaussian",

    "the profile of the phase distribution on opposite sides of phase jump @xmath0 @xmath40.9 ( which is interpreted in  5 as the second acoustic node ) seems to contradict the pure standing wave picture which requires a sharp 180 phase jump and non - variable phase on opposite sides of acoustic node .",
    "the phase diagrams of figures  [ fig : fewap ] ,  [ fig : rest ] , and  [ fig : apht ] appear to be a superposition of a step function ( i.e. discontinuous jump in phase ) along with a linear function of decreasing phase with .",
    "that is to say , the phase after ( and possibly before ) the phase jump at @xmath0 @xmath41 is not constant , rather it decreases linearly as one moves outward in the atmosphere ( smaller values of ) .",
    "the running wave component and linear decrease in phase outward in the atmosphere can qualitatively explain the non - equality to 180 in the phase spacing between of centers of distributions of two gaussians in figure  [ fig : histo ] .",

    "the magnetic fields can also influence spectral lines through magnetic zeeman splitting and lead to line broadening and intensification effects which can influence the depth of formation .",
    "it was thus natural to investigate whether the pulsational phase or amplitude of spectral lines correlated with their magnetic sensitivity .",
    "as a parameter of magnetic sensitivity the effective lande factors @xmath44 of spectral line transitions were taken from vald data base compilation .",

    "the phase variations for these higher @xmath44-lines decrease linearly with phase , but are shifted by about 0.5 in phase with respect to the linear trend seen for 1.1 @xmath13 @xmath44@xmath13 1.2 .",
    "however , these points can form a continuous phase variation to the lower @xmath44 lines if one considers that the spectral lines with @xmath44 @xmath17 1.4 are actually shifted by one complete pulsational cycle .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : lande ] shows the same diagram as the left panel , but for nd ii , dy ii , er ii and v ii lines .",
    "these do not show any well defined dependence between phase and effective lande factors .",
    "this discrepancy could be explained by different spatial distributions of these elements in comparison with fe , cr , gd , la and ca lines . assuming the presence of a vertical acoustic wave in the atmosphere the pulsation phases variations versus the @xmath44 for fe , cr , ca , gd and la lines may be considered as due to the strong influence of magnetic fields on the depth of formation of spectral lines .    according to the acoustic cross - sections of the atmosphere of 33  lib the vertical scale of",
    "the acoustic wave is small and is comparable to the thickness of the line forming region of the stellar atmosphere .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : lande ] suggests that magnetic intensification effects introduce changes in the line formation depth that is comparable to the vertical wavelength of the acoustic wave .",
    "thus over this vertical distance there are significant phase changes .",
    "however , the @xmath44k diagram in figure[fig : landa ] does not show a correlation between pulsation amplitudes versus the effective lande g - factors . a @xmath44 relationship determined with the inclusion of magnetic effects on the line formation",
    "should establish whether the phase changes are due to variability of effective depth of line formation induced by the magnetic sensitivity of lines .",
    "the approximately 2 hour duration of our rv data does not allow us to probe the origin of @xmath44@xmath45 dependence in 33  lib .",
    "future investigations with more accurate phase and amplitudes determinations and a better description of atmospheric elemental stratifications and magnetic intensification of lines are needed to get a better understanding of this effect .",
    "our pulsational phase data indicate the presence at least one pulsation node in the upper atmosphere , and probably a second one in the deeper atmospheric layers of 33 lib .",
    "the strongest evidence of upper node comes from the rv variations for nd ii and nd iii which are almost 180@xmath1 out - of - phase with each other ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nd23 ] ) . since nd ii and nd iii should be formed in different atmospheric layers these data provide convincing evidence for a upper atmospheric pulsational node .",
    "we estimate that the node is located above @xmath13 @xmath44.5 .",
    "a second phase jump in the lower atmosphere at @xmath0 @xmath40.9 is seen in the weak fe spectral lines ( fig .",

[ fig : histo ] .",
    "so , we suspect another , lower node below or at @xmath0 @xmath40.9 closer to the continuum formation level .",
    "the hypothesis of two acoustic nodes in the atmosphere of 33 lib can qualitatively explain the @xmath0 17% fraction of spectral lines and blends showing out - of - phase oscillations in figure  [ fig : histo ] . according to this hypothesis the upper node",
    "is located somewhere above @xmath0 @xmath44.5 and the second one below , or at @xmath0 @xmath40.9 , closer to the continuum formation level . in this case",
    "the layers where the majority of spectral lines are formed are pulsating with relative phases centred around @xmath35=0.88 and are between the two nodes .",
    "the other spectral lines that contribute to the smaller gaussian distribution of phases centred on @xmath35=0.425 are formed in two , out - of - phase pulsating layers : either below the lower node ( @xmath17 @xmath40.9 ) , where the weaker lines are formed or above the upper node ( @xmath13 @xmath44.5 ) where the few nd iii lines and some strong blends are formed .",
    "= 8.5truecm    theoretical work of gautschy et al .",
    "( 1998 ) supports our hypothesis about two radial pulsation nodes in the atmosphere of an roap star .",
    "gautschy et al . have calculated a sequence of models for roap star with a temperature inversion in the upper atmospheric layers .",
    "these models predict two displacement nodes in the stellar atmosphere : one close to the continuum formation @xmath29 @xmath0 2/3 and another at superficial layers ( see fig . 13 in their paper ) .",
    "the location of nodes in atmosphere is model and mode dependent , so the presence of two nodes in the line forming region is in principle theoretically possible .",
    "the inverted v-shaped variations in pulsational phase with the effective lande g - factor ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lande ] ) in 33 lib were unexpected .",
    "stift & leone ( 2003 ) presented an in - depth investigation of the increase in equivalent width of saturated lines under the influence of magnetic fields . assuming 20 different zeeman patterns ( with the number of components ranging from 3 to 45 ) they calculated equivalent widths as a function of magnetic field strength and showed that the equivalent width can increase by up to factors of 10 .",
    "thus , the magnetic field may strongly affect the in - line absorption and hence the effective depth of formation and this could result in a effective lande g - factor that is correlated with pulsation phase .",
    "this is consistent with phase changes across the atmosphere where the thickness of the line - forming region is comparable to the vertical wavelength of the acoustic wave , and that the influence of the magnetic field through intensification effect also occurs over this small region .",
    "[ fig : lande ] may thus reflect further evidence of a pulsation phase variability and running wave component in the stellar atmosphere .",
    "further investigations of the effective lande factor @xmath44 versus pulsation phase in other roap stars may prove fruitful .",
    "although rv variations have been measured for relatively few roap stars , these have already shown a rather complex behavior . in order to interpret fully these variations",
    "it is essential to perform detailed spectral analyses of these stars with a special emphasis on the accurate determination of the depth of formation for each spectral line , accurate acoustic cross - sections of atmosphere in lines of different chemical elements , and the study of their variability over the rotation period",
    ". this would yield knowledge about the acoustic profiles and location of the radial node in different surface areas and with respect to magnetic axis .    on another hand ,",
    "the acoustic cross - sections can also be used to refine the atmospheric models . the pulsation phase ( and amplitude ) distribution across the atmosphere",
    "is a unique and true link with the geometrical depth scale and could be used for atmospheric tomography .",
    "this tomograpic procedure should include the semi - empirical adjustment and tuning of the vertical and horizontal elemental distributions ( the latter can be known in advance , from doppler imaging ) and physical conditions in the model of atmosphere until the best solution for phase and amplitude cross - sections versus geometric depths for different chemical elements is attained ( and hence true transformation scales between ew , optical and geometrical depths obtained ) .",
    "for example , in our simplified approach for a model atmosphere of 33 lib with homogeneous vertical distribution of nd , the calculated optical depths suggest that nd ii and nd iii are formed at comparable optical depths which is inconsistent with the pulsational phases for nd iii ( fig  [ fig : ndewt ] ) .",
    "the restoration of vertical atmospheric structure and geometrical depths of spectral line formation are only as accurate as the measured rv pulsation phases and amplitudes of spectral lines formed in different atmospheric layers .",
    "for the long duration ( weeks ) spectral observations it is possible to increase the resolution in geometrical depths across the line - forming atmosphere to @xmath47 or better .    moreover , as the different p - modes having different oscillation frequencies are expected to have different depths for acoustic nodes in atmosphere ( gautschy et al . , 1998 )",
    ", this will lead to the different phase ( and amplitude ) profiles in atmospheric cross - sections measured on the same spectral lines but on different oscillation frequencies ( i.e. different modes ) .",
    "this expected effect gives an independent and additional tool to sounding the vertical acoustic structure of atmosphere and study vertical chemical abundances in multi - mode roap stars using different cross - sections .",
    "such an accurate tomographic analysis is beyond the scope of the current work and requires longer time series for an mono- or multi - mode roap star , rv measurements of much larger number spectral lines , and data taken with better signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "these data can be used to glean valuable information on the 3-dimensional structure to the pulsations and the stellar atmosphere of roap stars .",
