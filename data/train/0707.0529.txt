    "the field of quantum computation and quantum information has grown so rapidly in the recent years @xcite .",
    "quantum mechanics provides us powerful tools to solve specific problems , while it also imposes extra limitations .",
    "duplication is one of the most common operations on the classical computer , however , the so - called _ quantum no cloning theorem _ tells us that one can not copy arbitrary unknown quantum states perfectly @xcite .",
    "however , several schemes have been proposed to achieve realistic quantum cloning machines , which generate copies of arbitrary input qubits approximately , or probabilistically [ 3 - 8 ] .    the universal quantum cloning machine ( uqcm ) is first discussed by buzk and hillery @xcite , which provides identical fidelities to arbitrary input qubits .",
    "the progress on quantum cloning is reviewed by scarani et al . @xcite .",
    "the optimal @xmath0 uqcm performs the transformations :    @xmath1    where qubits are encoded in the basis @xmath2 , while @xmath3 is the initial state of blank copies and ancilla qubits , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the final ancilla states , and @xmath6 . after this operation , each copies has a fidelity of 5/6 buzek1996 , when compared to the input state .",

    "@xcite and zou et al .",
    "@xcite have proposed different schemes to realize uqcm . however , at least two cavities or two cavity - modes are needed in these works .",
    "inspired by paper @xcite , we turn to construct uqcm with squid embed in a high - q cavity , based on which , many quantum information processing schemes have been proposed [ 13 - 15 ] .",
    "our motivation is as follows :    _ ( 1 ) _ unlike rydberg atom used in cavity - qed , which is a `` flying '' qubit , squid embed in a high - q cavity is `` static '' , so it is comparatively easy to adjust its coupling coefficient to the cavity field , or to manipulate it with classical field or quantized field . in our scheme ,",
    "only one cavity is needed , which accords with the current experimental conditions .    _ ( 2 ) _ the level spacing of squid can be adjusted by changing the external flux or the critical current @xcite , so we can easily `` turn - on '' or `` turn - off '' the interaction between the squid and the cavity field . atom - velocity - selected device and passing qubits detection",
    "are not needed in our scheme .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we review the squid driven by quantized or classical microwave fields .",
    "cnot gate and two specific processes are also constructed . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss the detail of realizing the uqcm . a brief discussion and conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "we assume that the squid , considered throughout this paper , has a @xmath7-type three - level structure , as shown in fig.1 .",
    "the squid qubit is embed in a high - q cavity and can be manipulated by the cavity field as well as the microwave pulses . in this section ,",
    "we review the effective hamiltonian of the squid driven by a quantized or classical field .",
    "more details of squid and josephson - junction are discussed by makhlin et al .",
    "specific processes as well as cnot gate are also derived to realize the uqcm .",
    "consider a @xmath7-type three - level squid embeded in a high - q cavity .",
    "if its @xmath8 transition is resonant with the cavity field , the hamiltonian in the interaction picture under rotating - wave approximation can be written as yang2003:@xmath9 .\\]]where",
    "@xmath10 is the effective coupling constant @xcite , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the creation and annihilation operator of the cavity field , respectively .",
    "the evolution of this system can be easily derived as:@xmath13      consider a @xmath7-type three - level squid driven by a classical microwave pulse and suppose its @xmath14 transition is resonant with the classical field .",
    "then the effective hamiltonian in the interaction picture under rotating - wave approximation can be written as @xcite : @xmath15where @xmath16 is the effective coupling constant .",
    "the evolution of this system can be written as @xcite:@xmath17similarly , if the @xmath18 transition is resonant with the microwave pulse , and the other transitions are far - off resonant , the evolution of squid can be written as @xcite:@xmath19where @xmath20 is the effective coupling constant .",
    "consider a @xmath7-type three - level squid driven by two classical microwave pulses 1 and 2 ( depicted in fig .",
    "1 ) . this system constructs a two - photon raman resonance , if the @xmath21 transition and the @xmath22 transition are coupled to the microwave pulses 1 and 2 with identical detunings , i.e. @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the frequencies of two microwave pulses . in the case of large detuning ,",
    "the upper state @xmath26 can be eliminated adiabatically , and the evolution of this system follows yang2004:@xmath27where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the initial phases of two classical microwave pluses , respectively , and @xmath30 is the effective coupling constant .",
    "now we turn to construct two processes based on eq .",
    "( 7 ) , which are further needed in our universal cloning scheme .",
    "* process 1 * : in this process , we want to realize the transformation:@xmath31where @xmath32 and this can be realized with two steps :    _ step ( 1 ) _ : apply two microwave pulses to squid with @xmath33 , and adjust the interaction time to be @xmath34",

    "this process can be summarized as:@xmath44    we can adjust the evolution time @xmath35 and @xmath42 to satisfy @xmath45 . in this case , the two processes cost the same time .",
    "cnot is one of the most essential operations in quantum information , and it also plays important role in our scheme .",
    "inspired by previous work raimond2001 , which presents cnot gate in the cavity - qed with rydberg atom , here we propose a scheme to achieve cnot operation based on the interaction between squid and the cavity field , as discussed in section ii a. suppose that the information is coded on the @xmath46 and @xmath47 levels of the squid , which is embed in a high - q cavity , and its @xmath48 transition is set to be resonant with the cavity field .",

    "more technical considerations have been discussed in the previous papers @xcite@xcite .",
    "the cavity is initially prepared in the vacuum state @xmath58 , and squids are in the state @xmath59 .",
    "let squid1 be prepared in an arbitrary state @xmath60 with two classical microwave pulses , where @xmath61 .",

    "in conclusion , we have proposed a scheme for realizing a @xmath0 universal quantum cloning machine ( uqcm ) with superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) qubits , embeded in a high - q cavity .",

    "the microwave pulses are controlled by external equipments , and can manipulate squid qubits resonantly or with large detuning . in our scheme ,",
    "the information is encoded on the @xmath46 and @xmath87 levels , and the decay from the level @xmath87 should be very small , since no direct tunneling between the two levels are required@xcite .",
    "two - photon raman resonance processes are used to achieve the @xmath46 @xmath88 @xmath89 transition , which has been shown faster than the conventional gate operations @xcite .",
    "different from rydberg atom , the squid used in our scheme is a kind of `` static qubit '' , and we have no need to trap the qubits with complex technology . in previous proposals with rydberg atoms ,",
    "the atoms flying with a velocity of @xmath90 @xcite are hard to be trapped , so at least two cavities or two field - modes are needed in the those schemes .",
    "however , the embed squid can be manipulated with the cavity field for several times , as a result , only one cavity is needed in our uqcm scheme .",
    "neither atom - velocity - selected device nor passing qubits detection is needed in our scheme , and the `` static '' copies can easily be utilized after uqcm , so it has advantages in experimental realization and further utilization .",
