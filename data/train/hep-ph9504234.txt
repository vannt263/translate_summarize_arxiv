    "so far , no direct evidence for supersymmetry has been found either at lep@xcite ( where sparticle mass limits of @xmath16 have been obtained ) , or at tevatron experiments ( which have excluded gluinos and squarks lighter than about 150  gev@xcite ) .    in the future , lep ii",
    "is expected to explore sparticle masses up to @xmath17 gev@xcite .",
    "the fermilab tevatron experiments will be able to explore further ranges of @xmath18 and @xmath19 by searching for multi - jet@xmath20 events and multi - lepton @xmath21 multi - jet @xmath20 events from gluino and squark cascade decays@xcite . even if gluinos and most of the squarks are beyond the reach of tevatron collider experiments , it may still be possible to find signals for the top squark@xcite , which is expected@xcite to have a mass lighter than , and sometimes much lighter than , the other five flavors of squarks .",
    "there has recently been much interest in the clean trilepton signal from @xmath22 at the tevatron collider@xcite .",
    "many studies within the minimal supergravity ( sugra ) framework , find that @xmath23 ; it may thus be that gluinos and squarks are beyond the reach of tevatron experiments , while charginos and neutralinos are produced with significant cross sections .",
    "in addition , the @xmath24 ( and sometimes also the @xmath25 ) frequently have large branching fractions to leptons .",
    "this is in part because slepton masses are typically smaller than squark masses , so that decays via virtual sleptons are enhanced .",
    "also , in some regions of parameter space , sparticle mass and mixing patterns and/or interference effects can enhance ( but also diminish ) the leptonic branching fraction of @xmath24 , even if @xmath26 . combining production cross sections with branching ratios",
    "shows that the clean @xmath27 signal can be substantial over large regions of parameter space , whereas sm backgrounds for this topology are expected to be tiny .",
    "already the cdf and d0 experiments at the tevatron collider have collectively accumulated an integrated luminosity in excess of 0.1 @xmath28 and should amass a considerably larger data sample by the end of the current run , run ib .",
    "this should allow an exploration of @xmath29 gev ( @xmath30 gev ) for @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) , via the multi - jet@xmath20 search@xcite .",
    "in addition , experiments will finally be sensitive to exploring some of parameter space via top squark searches , and via clean trilepton searches .",
    "the tevatron main injector ( mi ) is expected to begin operation in 1999 , at @xmath0 tev , and should allow for integrated luminosities of @xmath33 to be accumulated per experiment .",
    "recently , there have been discussions concerning further luminosity upgrades beyond the mi , via anti - proton recycling and storage . these further luminosity upgrades , dubbed the ( tev - star ) project , could possibly accumulate @xmath34 of integrated luminosity per experiment . in this paper",
    ", we evaluate the capability of the mi and to search for sparticles , and compare their reach with that of lep ii and the recently approved lhc .",
    "we work within the framework of the minimal sugra model@xcite with radiative breaking of electroweak symmetry .",
    "several groups@xcite have studied the expectations for sparticle masses within this rather restricted framework which is completely determined by just four susy parameters renormalized at some ultra - high scale where the physics , because of assumptions about the symmetries of the interactions , is simple .",
    "these may be taken to be ,    * @xmath6 , a common scalar mass term , * @xmath35 , a common gaugino mass term , * @xmath36 , a common tri - linear coupling , and * @xmath37 , a bilinear coupling .",
    "the various gauge and yukawa couplings and soft breaking terms are then evolved from the unification scale down to the weak scale .",
    "the evolution@xcite can be traced via 26 renormalization group equations ( rge s ) .",
    "a remarkable consequence of this mechanism is that electroweak symmetry is automatically broken when one of the higgs mass squared terms gets driven to a negative value .",
    "the correct symmetry breaking pattern is then obtained for a large range of model parameters .",
    "the bilinear coupling @xmath37 can be eliminated in favor of @xmath38 ( ratio of higgs field vev s ) , and the magnitude ( but not the sign ) of the supersymmetric higgs mass term @xmath39 can be solved for in terms of @xmath40 .",
    "hence , the complete weak scale sparticle spectrum and sparticle mixing angles can be calculated in terms of the parameter set @xmath41 together with the sign of @xmath39 and the top quark mass @xmath42 .",
    "an iterative solution of the rge s , using two - loop gauge coupling rge s and the one - loop effective potential , has been implemented as the subprogram isasugra@xcite , and is a part of the isajet package@xcite , which we use in our analysis .    in order to assess the best channels for susy discovery , we first present total cross sections for various sparticle pair - production mechanisms in fig .  1 , for @xmath1 collisions at @xmath0 tev , using cteq2l parton distribution functions@xcite .",
    "to be specific , we show results for @xmath43 and a large and negative @xmath39 value , typical in sugra models . for fig .",
    "1_a _ , we show total cross sections versus @xmath18 for @xmath44 .",
    "we see that for @xmath45 gev , strong production of @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 pairs dominates . however , as @xmath18 increases , the strong production cross sections drop steeply , and are ultimately overtaken by those for the production of lighter charginos and neutralinos via the @xmath49 and @xmath50 reactions .",
    "these processes dominate for @xmath51 gev .",
    "also shown is the total cross section@xcite for gluinos and squarks produced in association with charginos and neutralinos ( labelled assoc .",

    "1_b _ , we plot the same cross sections , except that now @xmath52 .",
    "again , strongly interacting sparticle pair production ( along with on - shell @xmath53 production ) is dominant for small @xmath18 , but this time it becomes sub - dominant for @xmath54 gev .",
    "the cross sections for a large , positive value of @xmath39 are shown in fig .  2 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath55 tend to be significantly lighter than for negative values of @xmath39 , so that their production cross sections are even larger and dominate the strong production cross sections for smaller gluino masses than in fig .  1 .",
    "notice that , for @xmath56 , the non - observation of any susy signals at lep already indirectly excludes gluinos up to about 250  gev .",
    "the implications from figs .",
    "1 and 2 are clear : for current values of integrated luminosities , when the tevatron is exploring @xmath57 gev , experiments should obtain maximal reach by looking for signals from strongly interacting @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 production , such as multi - jets + @xmath58 events , and isolated leptons produced _ in association _ with jets from cascade decays of gluinos and squarks@xcite . to probe values of @xmath59 gev , which should be possible with larger data samples ,",
    "tevatron experiments should focus on signatures from @xmath60 and @xmath61 production@xcite .",
    "these reactions will also determine the ultimate reach of experiments at the tevatron , provided that the decay patterns of the charginos and neutralinos lead to final states that are observable above sm backgrounds .",
    "there are only a few promising experimental signatures from @xmath60 and @xmath61 production .",
    "the previously mentioned clean trilepton signal from @xmath4 occurs at an observable rate in large regions of the sugra parameter space and has only tiny _ physics _ backgrounds .",
    "there are also clean isolated dilepton signatures from @xmath62 production , although this suffers from large sm background due to @xmath63 production .",
    "furthermore , there is an isolated dilepton @xmath21jets signature from @xmath64 , which should be large in much the same region where the @xmath65 signature is visible , but which also suffers from large backgrounds .",
    "these dilepton signals could serve to confirm a signal in the relatively clean trilepton channel@xcite .",
    "finally , single isolated lepton @xmath21 jets and multi - jet @xmath20 signatures from these reactions , and also from @xmath66 production , should be buried below backgrounds from direct @xmath67 production and qcd multi - jet production , respectively .    to outline the rest of this paper , in sec .",
    "ii we show the results of detailed and extensive calculations of signal and background for the @xmath27 events , and plot the reach of the tevatron mi and also in sugra parameter space . in sec .",
    "iii , we perform a similar analysis for @xmath68 events , and in sec .",
    "iv , we consider @xmath69 events . in sec .",
    "v , we combine the results of the previous three sections with studies of signals from gluino and squark cascade decays , to compare the susy search capabilities of the main injector and upgrades with one another , and also with lep ii and the lhc .",
    "to calculate @xmath27 signal levels , we use the isajet 7.13 event generator program@xcite .",
    "we generate all possible subprocesses for chargino and neutralino pair production in our calculations , even though @xmath70 is the dominant component .",
    "the various chargino and neutralino decay branching ratios are calculated within isajet , to lowest order .",
    "isajet neglects initial / final state spin correlations , but these are not expected to be of great significance at hadron colliders .",
    "isajet also neglects decay matrix elements in the event generation ( but not the branching fraction calculation ) ; these are mainly expected to be significant when virtual states in 3-body decays are getting close to being on mass shell .",
    "isajet is also used to calculate the dominant physics backgrounds , which are expected ( after cuts ) to be @xmath71 production , and @xmath72 production .",
    "we model experimental conditions using a toy calorimeter with segmentation @xmath73 and extending to @xmath74 .",
    "we assume an energy resolution of @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) for the hadronic ( electromagnetic ) calorimeter .",
    "jets are defined to be hadron clusters with @xmath77  gev in a cone with @xmath78 .",
    "leptons with @xmath79  gev and within @xmath80 are considered to be isolated if the hadronic scalar @xmath81 in a cone with @xmath82 about the lepton is smaller than @xmath83 . in our analyses , we neglect multiple scattering effects , an explicit detector simulation , and fake backgrounds from @xmath84 and jet mis - identification . for this reason , our results should be regarded as optimistic .    to extract signal from background",
    ", various sets of cuts have been proposed@xcite . in this paper , since we are interested in the maximal reach of a high luminosity tevatron collider , we take somewhat harder cuts than these previous studies . in table",
    "i , we list the cross section after successive cuts , for two sugra cases : ( @xmath85)= ( 200,165,0,2,-1,170 ) and ( 200,200,0,2,+1,170 ) , where all mass parameters are in gev .",
    "we also list backgrounds from @xmath71 production for @xmath86 gev , and from @xmath72 production .",
    "the cuts we implement are the following .",
    "* we require 3 _ isolated _ leptons in each event , with @xmath87 gev , @xmath88 gev , and @xmath89 gev .",

    "this cut removes backgrounds ( not listed ) from sm processes such as drell - yan dilepton production , where an extra accompanying jet fakes a lepton . * to reduce background from @xmath72 production , we require that the invariant mass of any opposite - sign , same flavor dilepton pair not reconstruct the @xmath93 mass , _",

    "* we finally require the events to be _",
    "clean _ , _",
    "i.e. _ no jets ( as defined above ) should be present .",
    "this is labelled as ( @xmath95 ) .    at this point ,",
    "the surviving total background rates are @xmath96 , leaving @xmath97 background events per @xmath2 of integrated luminosity .",
    "the background mainly comes from @xmath72 events , where @xmath98 , with subsequent @xmath99 leptonic decay .",
    "the @xmath100 level for discovery of a signal corresponds to @xmath101 , or @xmath102 events for the same luminosity .",
    "the two signal cases listed in the table are well above this limit .",
    "our next task is to delineate the regions of sugra parameter space where a clean trilepton signal is observable , both for the tevatron mi , as well as for tev@xmath103 , after our simulation of signal events , with the effect of cuts included .",

    "we take @xmath86 gev , consistent with the values recently obtained by the cdf and d0 experiments@xcite .",
    "the regions of the plane shaded by a brick wall are excluded on theoretical grounds , either because of lack of appropriate electroweak symmetry breaking , or because the lsp becomes either the sneutrino ( excluded in ref .",

    "the sampled points in sugra space which yield an observable signal at the tevatron mi , assuming @xmath3 of integrated luminosity , are shown with black squares . at the mi , where the probability of getting more than one background event is smaller than 2% , we have required a minimum of five signal events to claim discovery ",

    "3_b _ various sparticle mass contours for @xmath115 , @xmath25 and @xmath116 . by comparing fig . 3_a",
    "_ with 3_b _ , we see that the maximal reach in @xmath18 at the mi is achieved at @xmath117 gev , for which @xmath118 gev , and @xmath119 gev . in this region of relatively low values of @xmath6 , sleptons are much lighter than squarks , so leptonic branching ratios of @xmath24 are enhanced . for larger values of @xmath35 ,",
    "the @xmath120 mass difference becomes sufficiently large that the two body decay mode @xmath121 opens up , dominating the @xmath24 branching fractions , and spoiling the signal .",
    "the onset of this `` spoiler mode '' is denoted by the correspondingly labelled horizontal contour .",
    "if @xmath6 is sufficiently small , then sleptons and sneutrinos become light enough that @xmath122 , @xmath123 or @xmath124 are accessible , and can dominate @xmath24 decay modes .",
    "diagonal contours denoting the regions where these modes are accessible are also labelled .",
    "we see that as @xmath6 increases , squarks and sleptons become increasingly heavy .",
    "even so , for large @xmath6 , the tevatron mi still has a reach via clean trileptons out to @xmath125 gev , corresponding to @xmath126 gev .",
    "the sugra points accessible to are denoted by squares with x s ( @xmath127 level ) , and open squares ( @xmath100 level ) . sampled points with signal between 3 - 5@xmath128 are labelled with triangles , and points with less than a @xmath114 signal are denoted by x s .",
    "note that with the @xmath100 criterion of observability , the signal to background ratio exceeds two . for small @xmath6 ,",
    "we see that has an extraordinary reach out to @xmath129 gev , corresponding to @xmath130  gev ! in this region , @xmath24 , which is predominantly @xmath131-gaugino ,",
    "dominantly decays to @xmath132 and @xmath133 , even though @xmath121 is accessible . as @xmath6 increases , the @xmath134 decay mode closes ,",
    "so @xmath135 is nearly 100% , and is invisible .",
    "this is the cause for the region of non - observability that extends to low @xmath35 , to the left of the @xmath135 contour . as @xmath6 increases further , the @xmath135 decay is no longer accessible and @xmath24 decays to @xmath136 , although this mode now competes with the higgs spoiler , which is typically larger . for even larger values of @xmath6 ,",
    "all two - body decays to sleptons are closed . in this region , can see ( almost ) up to the higgs spoiler over a large range of parameter space , corresponding to @xmath137  gev , or @xmath7  gev , thus considerably expanding upon the reach of the tevatron mi .",
    "we also see in fig . 3_b _ the region below the dashed contours which is the approximate reach of lep ii via higgs , slepton pair or chargino pair searches .",
    "we see that the mi and can probe significant regions beyond the lep ii reach for charginos or sleptons , especially in the small @xmath6 area . however , if mi or do see a signal , then lep ii probably should have discovered the lightest susy higgs boson .    in fig .",
    "4 , we show the same results in the @xmath104 plane , except now we choose @xmath138 .",
    "this mainly alters the masses and mixing angles of the charginos and neutralinos from those in fig .",
    "3 . in this case",
    ", we see that the tevatron mi will have a maximal reach to @xmath139 gev , corresponding to @xmath140 gev , but only in the region where @xmath141 gev .",
    "the option can again greatly expand this region , now probing up to @xmath129 gev ( @xmath142 gev ) in the favourable case when @xmath24 decays to real sleptons are allowed .",
    "if these decays are not allowed , then the region of detectability is limited by the opening up of the @xmath143 spoiler mode for the lower range of @xmath6 .",
    "experiments at can probe @xmath6 out to @xmath144 gev , corresponding to @xmath145 gev .",
    "there is a major difference between the positive ( fig .",
    "4 ) and negative ( fig .",
    "3 ) @xmath39 cases : for larger values of @xmath6 , there is _ no reach at all in @xmath35 beyond current lep limits _ , for @xmath9 .",
    "this lack of reach can be traced directly to the @xmath146 branching fraction , which can drop by two orders of magnitude when the sign of @xmath39 is flipped to be positive , in the large @xmath6 region@xcite .",
    "the major decrease in @xmath24 branching fraction , noted previously in ref .",
    "@xcite , is mainly due to interference effects amongst the @xmath147 and @xmath93 mediated three body decay amplitudes .",
    "this `` hole '' lies in the region favored by the simplest @xmath148 supergravity gut model , if we take proton decay and dark matter constraints@xcite literally .",
    "such a scenario can thus be well - tested at ( via trileptons ) for @xmath8 , but not for @xmath9 .",
    "finally , we remark that for very large values of @xmath6 ( and correspondingly large slepton and squark masses ) the amplitudes for sfermion mediated decays of @xmath24 become very small , and the leptonic branching fraction becomes the same as that for the @xmath93 boson .",
    "the on - set of this effect can be seen in fig .  4 where we see that for @xmath149  gev , the crosses give way to triangles and squares indicating the expected reduction of the interference effects .    in fig .  5",
    ", we show again the @xmath104 plane , but this time for @xmath150 .",
    "we only show results for @xmath8 for brevity . for positive values of @xmath39 and large values of @xmath6",
    "very similar results are obtained .",
    "this is because for large values of @xmath38 the leptonic branching fraction of @xmath24 is roughly symmetric about @xmath151 when its three body decays dominate@xcite and the kinematics is roughly similar . for small values of @xmath6",
    "the results for positive and negative values of @xmath39 are somewhat different . for @xmath152",
    "the neutralino mainly decays invisibly via the @xmath153 mode whereas for positive values of @xmath39 the @xmath154 mode frequently dominates .    from fig .  5",
    ", we see that there are very few points accessible to tevatron mi . for large values of @xmath6 , this is mainly due to a large enhancement in the hadronic @xmath24 decays , at the expense of leptonic modes . in the small @xmath6 region , where dominantly two",
    "body decays take place , most of the branching fraction is taken up by @xmath155 decays .",
    "although the branching fractions to the visible leptonic decays are a few percent , it should be kept in mind that @xmath156 is rather small , so that the daughter lepton from chargino decay tends to be soft resulting in a reduced detection efficiency for these events .",
    "the corresponding region may well be larger for positive values of @xmath39 and small @xmath6 where the branching fraction for the leptonic @xmath24 decays are almost an order of magnitude larger .",
    "as in fig .  3 and fig .  4",
    ", the collider option has a much greater reach throughout parameter space than the tevatron mi , and can explore up to @xmath130 gev , but only for a very narrow range of @xmath157 gev . for @xmath152 and larger values of @xmath158 gev , can probe to @xmath7 gev but the @xmath100 reach frequently does not extend to where the spoiler decays become accessible .",
    "finally , for @xmath159 gev , there is again a `` hole '' of non - observability extending all the way down to the current lep constraint , due again to the @xmath146 branching fraction suppression ( which also occurs when @xmath56 ) .",
    "we see from fig .  1 that at least for the large values of @xmath39 expected in sugra models , along with @xmath160 , the @xmath161 cross section remains large out to large values of @xmath18 .",
    "a signal ( with the expected strength ) in this channel accompanying the clean trilepton events discussed in section ii would serve as strong evidence for the supersymmetric origin of these events .",
    "the best signature for chargino pair production is in the clean , opposite - sign ( os ) , isolated dilepton channel@xcite ; single lepton plus jets and multi - jet @xmath20 signatures should be well below sm backgrounds . assuming that it is possible to veto @xmath162 events , the major sm backgrounds to the clean os dilepton signal consist of drell - yan @xmath163 production , @xmath164 production , @xmath71 production ( where the @xmath165 jets are soft ) , and pair production of vector bosons , especially @xmath63 production .",
    "since clean dilepton events can come from a variety of susy sources , to evaluate the signal we generate _ all _ possible susy production reactions .",
    "we implement the following set of cuts , designed to extract signal from these backgrounds .",
    "the results of these successive cuts on two signal cases , and backgrounds , are shown in table ii .    *",
    "we require exactly two _ isolated _ os ( either @xmath166 or @xmath39 ) leptons in each event , with @xmath167 gev and @xmath168 gev , and @xmath169 .",
    "in addition , we require _ no _ jets , which effectively reduces most of the @xmath71 background .",
    "these cuts are labelled as ( @xmath170 , @xmath95 ) . *",
    "we require @xmath92 gev ( labelled ( @xmath58 ) ) .",
    "this cut removes backgrounds from drell - yan dilepton production , and also the bulk of the background from @xmath171 decay .",
    "notice that the @xmath172 background still dominates .",
    "* we require @xmath173 , to further reduce @xmath172 ( labelled @xmath174 ) . *",
    "we require the @xmath93 mass cut : invariant mass of any opposite - sign , same flavor dilepton pair not reconstruct the @xmath93 mass , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath175 gev .",
    "this cut is labelled ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "we see from the fourth row of table ii that the dominant remaining background comes from @xmath63 production . however , the leptons and @xmath58 from two - body @xmath67 boson decays are considerably harder than those from three body chargino decay to a massive lsp , via @xmath176 .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that a cut on @xmath177 gev was effective to separate softer top _ squark _ events from hard top _ quark _",
    "events ; the same works here to gain significant rejection on @xmath63 bg with only modest loss of signal , as shown in fig . 6 .",
    "( if the decay channel @xmath178 is open , this cut is not effective ; we have , however , checked that these cases are very difficult to see above background anyway . ) hence , we further require    * @xmath177 gev , ( labelled as ( @xmath179 ) ) .",
    "the final cross sections for two cases of signal and background are shown in the last row of table ii .",
    "assuming an integrated luminosity of 25 @xmath28 , both these signal cases should be observable above background at the @xmath100 level . for the second case , this corresponds to 214 signal events , as opposed to @xmath1801100 bg events- a 20% effect .",
    "while this may sound marginal , we note that the bulk of the background , from @xmath63 production , can be well - measured and normalized , so that the signal can be looked for as a distortion in , for instance , the low energy end of the distribution in @xmath179 shown in fig .",
    "we plot the regions of observability of this signal in the @xmath104 sugra plane , in the upper frames _ a _ ) of figs .",
    "7 - 9 for the same values of parameters as in figs .  3 - 5 .",
    "the hatched and bricked regions are identical to those in figs .  3 - 5 .",
    "the following points are worth noting .",
    "* for the @xmath181 , @xmath8 case illustrated in fig .",
    "7_a _ , the region of space explorable via clean dileptons is a subset of the region accessible via clean trileptons .",
    "however , for the @xmath181 , @xmath9 case shown in fig 8_a _ , the clean dilepton channel offers a reach well into the `` hole '' region of the trilepton plot fig . 4_a_.",
    "* there are significant regions of the @xmath104 plane where both the trilepton as well as the clean dilepton signal should be observable .",
    "as noted above , the simultaneous detection of a signal in both channels at the expected relative rates , and with the correct kinematics , may serve to identify their origin .",
    "it is also instructive to note that charginos should also be detectable at lep ii over much of this same region .",
    "although this will obviously be sensitive to the energy at which lep ii becomes operational , it seems likely that the reach of mi and in the clean dilepton channel will not significantly exceed that of lep ii .",

    "@xmath28 of integrated luminosity , the signal cross section required for a @xmath100 observation is 5.1  @xmath195 .",
    "both of the signal cases listed in table iii are thus observable .",
    "we remark again that the main background processes will be well measured from collider data .",
    "in addition , since the signal only occurs in the same - flavor channel , it leads to an excess of @xmath196 and @xmath197 events over @xmath198 events .",
    "the regions of the sugra plane where this signal is observable are shown in fig .",
    "7_b_-9_b _ for the same values of parameters as in figs .",
    "7_a_-9_a_. we see that except for tiny regions of parameter space , this signal does not probe regions not accessible via the other channels .",
    "there are , however , sizeable regions where the jets plus os dilepton signal can be used to confirm a signal seen in other channels .",
    "finally , we remark that a simultaneous measurement of the susy cross section in this channel together with @xmath199 discussed in sec .",
    "ii , directly yields the leptonic branching fraction for decays of the chargino .",
    "this assumes that the sample of jets plus os dilepton events comes mainly from @xmath60 production ; _ i.e. _ contributions from other susy sources are negligible , and further , that the background can be reliably subtracted .",
    "it would thus be interesting to see if cuts can be devised to separate the @xmath60 source of these dilepton events from cascade decays of squarks and gluinos or from associated production processes as was done for the trilepton events in ref.@xcite",
    "in supersymmetric models where the running gaugino masses unify at a high scale , and the weak scale parameter @xmath39 greatly exceeds the @xmath200 and @xmath131 gaugino masses @xmath201 and @xmath202 ( as is the case for the minimal sugra model ) , one typically expects @xmath203 . as a result , @xmath204 and",
    "@xmath205 are the dominant sparticle production processes at the tevatron if gluinos and squarks are heavier than 250 - 300  gev , so that signals from these channels offer the best reach for supersymmetry at high luminosity upgrades of the tevatron .",
    "the most promising signals from these reactions are :      motivated by the recent interest in the upgrade of the tevatron collider designed to yield an integrated luminosity of @xmath208 we have used isajet to compute these susy signals within the framework of the minimal supergravity model with gauge coupling unification and radiative breaking of electroweak symmetry .",
    "specifically , we have scanned sections of the multi - dimensional parameter space , and delineated the regions where the susy signal is observable over sm _ physics _ backgrounds .",
    "since we have not included a real detector simulation , effects due to multiple scattering during bunch crossings , or backgrounds due to @xmath209 s or @xmath84 s faking an electron ( these are all sensitive to details of the ultimate collider and detector design ) , our conclusions must be regarded as on the optimistic side .    the region of the @xmath210 supergravity parameter plane where the trilepton signal is expected to be observable , with a significance @xmath211 at the main injector and at the , is shown by solid squares and hollow squares , respectively , in figs .",
    "3 - 5_a_. figs .",
    "7 - 9 illustrate the corresponding regions where the dilepton signals are expected to be observable . from these figures , we see that experiments at should be able to probe significantly larger regions of parameter space than at the main injector , in both the dilepton and trilepton channels .",
    "when @xmath6 is small ( @xmath212  gev ) , the trilepton signal may be ( indirectly ) sensitive to gluino masses as heavy as @xmath213  gev ! however , even in this favorable region , there exist holes of non - observability due to neutralino / chargino decays to soft or invisible particles . for @xmath43 , @xmath6 large ( @xmath214  gev ) and negative values of @xmath39 , experiments at may be able to see trilepton signals essentially until the `` spoiler mode '' @xmath121 becomes accessible ( @xmath7 gev ) .",
    "however , if @xmath9 , large interference effects in the neutralino leptonic decay width severely suppress the signal if 400  gev  @xmath215  1000  gev , and a gaping hole where there is no detectable trilepton signal remains in the parameter space , all the way down to the currently excluded lep chargino mass limit . for large values of @xmath38 ,",
    "the parameter space hole is somewhat smaller , though generally speaking the cross section often falls below the detectable level even when the spoiler decay modes of @xmath24 are closed .",
    "if a trilepton signal is discovered , will there be a confirming discovery in the dilepton channels ?",
    "are clean dilepton signals observable in the parameter space hole mentioned above ? figs .",
    "7 - 9 show that indeed large regions of parameter space can be probed in the dilepton channel .",
    "the region probed by the os dilepton plus jets channel forms a subset of that explorable via trileptons .",
    "however , the clean ( no jets ) os dilepton channel is to some extent complementary to the trilepton channel , in that this signal can be seen in regions of parameter space where the trilepton signal is suppressed .",
    "we note , however , that the regions explorable via dileptons at overlap considerably with the regions explorable by lep ii via slepton and chargino searches , as shown by the dashed contours in figs .",
    "3_b_-5_b_.      how does the reach for supersymmetry in the os dilepton and trilepton channels considered here compare with the reach in other channels such at multi - jets @xmath20 and same - sign dileptons ?",
    "the various multi - jet and multi - lepton signals from production and cascade decay of all susy particles have been computed previously in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath216 .",
    "we have repeated this calculation for comparison with the results obtained here , except now we use the sugra parameters with @xmath217 ( which yields @xmath32 ) and @xmath218 ( which yields @xmath219 , and consider both signs of @xmath39 .",
    "we set @xmath105 , and @xmath181 .",
    "we have computed the cross sections for the multi - jet @xmath20 and ss dilepton event topologies , with the same cuts as in ref.@xcite for various values of @xmath35 ( @xmath220 ) and compared against sm backgrounds@xcite for @xmath86 gev .",
    "the reach of the tevatron mi , and also , computed in terms of @xmath18 , is shown in table iv , for comparison with results obtained in this paper .",
    "the reader should view these numbers in proper perspective , since we have not scanned the complete parameter space in constructing this table , but have fixed @xmath36 and @xmath38 .",
    "indeed , the reach in some channels , _ e.g. _ the trilepton channel , is sensitive especially to @xmath38 .    for the multi - jet @xmath20 channel ( labelled @xmath58 ) , naive application of the @xmath100 criterion",
    "gives a reach of typically 350 - 400  gev at the tev@xmath103 ( listed in parenthesis ) .",
    "however , since the signal to background ratio @xmath221 is smaller than 3% ( if the signal is at the @xmath100 level ) , and there are no characteristic kinematic bumps expected in the signal , it may not be realistic to expect detectability at this level",
    ". we , therefore , also list a conservative reach by requiring , in addition , @xmath222 ( no parenthesis ) .",
    "the most peculiar point about the @xmath58 signal is that in the trilepton `` hole '' region , for the mi at least , there is again no reach beyond the current lep chargino bound .",
    "this is because for @xmath56 and small values of @xmath38 , the lep chargino limit already implies @xmath223 gev , for which the strong production cross sections are already rather small@xcite . as can be seen from fig .",
    "2_b _ , chargino / neutralino pair production is the dominant production mechanism , and most multi - jet @xmath20 events come from their hadronic decays . since @xmath25 and @xmath55 tend to be especially light for positive values of @xmath39 , their production yields a rather soft @xmath58 spectrum , which is difficult to see above background .",
    "we also list the reach for supersymmetry in the ss dilepton channel .",
    "this signal was originally proposed as a way to test the majorana nature of the gluino , by searching for @xmath224 decays , followed by @xmath225 .",
    "the @xmath226 channel is of course only useful as long as one is making a sufficient number of gluino pairs in the first place , and that there is a reasonable efficiency to detect the decay leptons .",
    "we see from table iv that the ss dilepton signal is as well not visible in the trilepton `` hole '' region , due to a combination of low production cross section together with a low efficiency to detect the leptons which tend to be soft because both @xmath227 and @xmath228 tend to be smaller for @xmath56 as compared to for @xmath152 .",
    "indeed , for the other parameters of table iv where there is a reach via ss dileptons up to quite high values of @xmath18 , most of the dileptons originate from @xmath65 events , where one of the leptons is lost .",
    "we further see from table iv that the reach in ss or os dileptons is generally similar , and that in moving from tevatron mi to , the reach in @xmath18 is increased by typically 100  gev",
    ".    slepton pair production ( which has been included in our computation ) is best detected via the clean os lepton signal@xcite .",
    "the slepton signal will be observable at the mi only for slepton masses lighter than around 50  gev@xcite , while the reach of is comparable to that of lep ii .",
    "a comparison of the reach of every channel shows that the maximal reach is always obtained in the clean @xmath65 channel , except for the `` hole '' region where @xmath229  gev , and @xmath9 : in this region , only has a significant reach in the clean os dilepton channel , and perhaps , in the @xmath58 channel .",
    "the current run of the tevatron @xmath1 collider , run ib , is expected to attain @xmath230 of integrated luminosity per experiment .",
    "with such a data sample , the cdf and d0 experiments should be sensitive to susy signals in several channels other than the canonical multi - jet @xmath20 channel .",
    "in particular , the clean trilepton channel ought to allow tevatron experiments to probe regions of parameter space significantly beyond the range of lep , and perhaps , even up to the reach of lep ii .",
    "in 1996 , lep ii is expected to ramp up to cm energy @xmath231  gev , which should allow @xmath232 , @xmath227 and @xmath233  gev to be probed .",
    "the relatively model - independent search for supersymmetry will optimistically probe the regions below the dashed contours in figs .",
    "3_b_-5_b_. by 1999 , the tevatron mi may be operational , and is expected to amass @xmath33 of data per experiment",
    ". the regions explorable at the mi can be significantly larger than those accessible to lep ii , but only in the lower regions of @xmath6 , where sleptons are significantly lighter than squarks , so that leptonic decays of neutralinos are enhanced .",
    "the reach of the tevatron mi via dilepton signals is essentially a subset of the parameter space that lep ii can explore , so we do not expect new progress to be made in this channel by mi experiments , above and beyond what lep ii can do .",
    "an upgrade of the tevatron to would be particularly well - suited to exploit the clean trilepton channel expected from many susy models .",
    "the relatively small signal rates may well be detectable above tiny sm backgrounds , if machine and detector dependent backgrounds can be controlled .",
    "a luminosity upgrade to @xmath234 of integrated luminosity ought to allow for a substantial increase in the amount of susy parameter space that can be explored : in favourable cases , equivalent gluino masses as high as 700 gev can be probed ! however , in spite of its increased reach for susy , we note that there are substantial regions of susy parameter space which _ can not _ be explored by , either due to invisible neutralino decays , leptonic branching fraction suppression , the turn on of neutralino spoiler modes , or just kinematically suppressed production cross sections .",
    "probably the main motivation for weak scale supersymmetry comes from the fact that it provides a mechanism for stabilizing the weak scale if sparticle masses are smaller than @xmath235  tev .",
    "some authors have attempted to quantify this by imposing fine - tuning requirements , and have obtained upper bounds on sparticle masses@xcite .",
    "their arguments , although admittedly rather subjective , nonetheless suggest sparticle mass bounds @xmath236 gev .",
    "even taking such an upper limit literally , it would still not be possible to make a definitive seach for supersymmetry at lep ii or at .",
    "on the other hand , recent work@xcite on the multi - jet @xmath20 signal indicates that the cern lhc @xmath237 collider , operating at @xmath238 tev , can explore the entire range of parameter space up to @xmath239 gev ( @xmath31 ) or @xmath240 gev ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "it thus appears that experiments at supercolliders are essential to ensure that weak scale susy does not escape experimental detection .",

    "<S> we compare with the corresponding reach of the tevatron main injector ( @xmath3 of data ) . </S>",
    "<S> working within the framework of minimal supergravity with gauge coupling unification and radiative electroweak symmetry breaking , we first calculate the regions of parameter space accessible via the clean trilepton signal from @xmath4 production , with detailed event generation of both signal and major physics backgrounds </S>",
    "<S> . the trilepton signal can allow equivalent gluino masses of up to @xmath5 gev to be probed if @xmath6 is small . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath6 is large , then @xmath7 gev can be probed for @xmath8 ; however , for @xmath9 and large values of @xmath6 , the rate for @xmath10 is suppressed by interference effects , and there is _ no _ reach in this channel . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine regions where the signal from @xmath11 is detectable . </S>",
    "<S> although this signal is background limited , it is observable in some regions where the clean trilepton signal is too small . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the signal @xmath12 can confirm the clean trilepton signal in a substantial subset of the parameter space where the trilepton signal can be seen . </S>",
    "<S> we note that although the clean trilepton signal may allow tevatron experiments to identify signals in regions of parameter space beyond the reach of lep ii , the dilepton channels generally probe much the same region as lep ii . </S>"
