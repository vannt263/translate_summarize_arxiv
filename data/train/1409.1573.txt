    "observations indicate that 85% of the matter in the universe is non - luminous and point towards the existence of cold dark matter particles .",
    "determining the identify of dark matter ( dm ) is one of the most pressing issues before us today .",
    "an important method of searching for dark matter is indirect detection , which searches for dm annihilating into a pair of standard model ( sm ) particles , producing an excess of gamma rays or antiparticles .",
    "the gamma rays can appear as a distinct line at an energy corresponding to the mass of the annihilating dark matter particles , or as a continuous energy spectrum created by radiation from scattering , hadronization , and decay of the sm final states .",
    "several anomalies with these features have recently appeared in data sets@xcite .",
    "however , it is unfortunately a fact of life that indirect signals of dark matter can be ambiguous , and a dark matter explanation for many of the observed excesses to - date competes with more mundane astrophysical sources and instrumental backgrounds@xcite .",
    "the _ fermi _   gamma - ray space telescope has performed an all - sky survey of gamma rays@xcite and has searched for dark matter signals from the galactic center , as well as from faint dwarf galaxies . as data accumulates , the latter pursuit has proven to provide relatively background - free constraints on dark matter candidates@xcite .",
    "however , an excess of gamma rays from the galactic center ( gc ) has become increasingly intriguing as its characterization has improved @xcite .",
    "the spectrum and angular distributions of this excess are well described by annihilating dark matter , with an energy spectrum peaking at 1 - 3 gev , and an approximate spherical distribution about the center of the milky way .",
    "the flux displays the characteristics of a nfw halo profile of @xmath1 with @xmath2 .",
    "a fit to the spectrum is consistent with 30 - 40 gev dark matter particles annihilating dominantly into @xmath3 final states ( a lighter 7 - 10 gev particle annihilating to taus is also possible , but somewhat disfavored ) , with a cross section of @xmath4  @xmath5s@xmath6 .",
    "this value of the cross section is tantalizingly consistent with that expected for a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) thermal relic , which is a particularly interesting dm candidate since it can account for the observed dm relic density through the simple mechanism of thermal freeze - out .",
    "accordingly , several ideas have recently been put forward to explore a particle physics explanation of this excess in the center of our galaxy@xcite .",
    "recently , a comprehensive study of model systematics for galactic diffuse emission has been performed @xcite with the result that an excess of gamma - rays from the gc persists in the _ fermi _ data .",
    "however , the fit to the dark matter hypothesis in this analysis implies a slightly larger value of @xmath7 gev for the mass of the dark matter candidate , with an upper limit of roughly 70 gev at 99% c.l .",
    "given the significance of the galactic center excess observed by _",
    "fermi _ , and the apparent match of its characteristics to wimp dark matter expectations , it is important to explore whether or not it can be accommodated by a uv - complete theoretical framework , such as supersymmetry ( susy ) . susy with r - parity conservation",
    "is the most appealing and widely examined scenario for physics beyond the sm and naturally incorporates a dm candidate , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) . within the framework of conventional thermal wimp relics ,",
    "the lsp is generally identified with the lightest neutralino , as is the case in the minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm ) , although other possibilities exist in more extensive structures .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to determine whether the present - day pair annihilation of a neutralino lsp in the galactic center can be the source of the observed _ fermi _  excess .",
    "our results show that this exercise is not trivial , and that specific requirements are placed on model building efforts which attempt to realize this possibility within the susy framework . in particular , it appears that fermionic dark matter annihilating via a relatively light pseudoscalar mediator is the best option , as recently discussed by others@xcite .    as part of our model building efforts",
    ", we first examined a number of susy scenarios that failed to reproduce the gc excess .",
    "the 19-parameter p(henomenological ) mssm@xcite does not have enough freedom to explain the gc excess , assuming a thermal history for the lsp .",
    "a model with dirac gauginos@xcite requires t - channel exchange of a light charged sparticle , in conflict with lep , tristan and lhc bounds . extending both the matter and gauge content of susy within a gut context , such as @xmath8@xcite , leads to an annihilation cross section that is far too small .",
    "as each of these cases teaches a useful lesson , we briefly summarize our findings for each case in section 2 .",
    "after investigating these options , we examine the next - to - mssm ( nmssm ) , which incorporates an additional gauge singlet superfield@xcite .",
    "this model is attractive in its own right as it naturally generates the @xmath9-term in the superpotential and easily accommodates the mass of the observed higgs boson@xcite .",
    "the extra superfield results in an additional neutralino - the singlino - and two extra higgs fields , one cp - odd and one cp - even .",
    "the extra field content allows a wider range of dark matter properties and annihilation channels@xcite .",
    "the most common form of this model incorporates a @xmath10 symmetry that eliminates terms with a mass dimension in the superpotential .",
    "with this @xmath10 symmetry imposed , we find that pseudoscalar exchange alone is not sufficient to describe the observations .",
    "a sliver of parameter space with significant annihilation through both the @xmath11 boson and light pseudoscalar @xmath12 channels has recently been shown to accommodate@xcite the _ fermi _  galactic center excess ( fgce ) .",
    "we summarize our results for the @xmath10 option in section 3 .",
    "we next expand our quest to one last susy model - the general nmssm , which incorporates five additional parameters over the @xmath10 case .",
    "we find that the fgce is well - described and selects a well - defined region of the parameter space within this model .",
    "this region is found to be consistent with other measurements and we study some of its predictions for future experiments .",
    "our results are discussed in section 4 .",
    "for most of our analysis we employ the results of @xcite as discussed above with a 30 - 40 gev dark matter candidate .",
    "however , for the uv - complete scenarios that do not offer a good fit to this description , we comment on the possibility of extending the dark matter mass range to 70 gev ( but with similar annihilation cross sections ) as determined by calore @xcite and show that this possibility does not influence our results .    in section 5 we present our summary , where we conclude that the most robust susy scenario describing the fgce is the general nmssm . within this scenario",
    ", we find that the data selects a specific region of parameter space and that the signatures , such as in higgs physics at the lhc and in direct detection , are small and will be difficult , if not impossible , to detect .",
    "it is possible that indirect detection thus provides the best probe of this scenario .",
    "here , we provide a brief overview of the set of well - motivated susy models that we investigated in light of the fgce . all of these scenarios fail to describe the observed excess while retaining consistency with other measurements .",
    "we believe that it is instructive to understand why each case falls short of explaining the excess and will incorporate these lessons in constructing the successful scenario presented below .",
    "the pmssm@xcite is a natural place to begin the search for a plausible susy scenario that can explain the fgce since it contains the minimal particle content , yet enjoys a reasonable amount of freedom in its parameter space . here",
    ", we consider a version of the pmssm with a majorana neutralino lsp ( @xmath13 ) as part of a 19-dimensional subspace of the full @xmath14100-parameter r - parity conserving mssm .",
    "a set of experimentally - motivated constraints have been imposed : ( @xmath12 ) the soft - breaking parameters are taken to be real so that no new sources of cp violation are present , ( @xmath15 ) mfv holds at the tev scale so that flavor physics is essentially controlled by the ckm matrix , ( @xmath16 ) the first and second generation sfermions are assumed to be degenerate for each sparticle type , and ( @xmath17 ) the @xmath18-terms and yukawa couplings of these two generations are assumed to be negligible . in recent work@xcite ,",
    "we have generated two sets of pmssm models ( , unique points in this parameter space ) with a neutralino lsp .",
    "these samples are consistent with collider , flavor , cosmological and precision measurements .",
    "we employ the `` low - ft '' model set , which has a large sample of lsps with masses between 30 and 40 gev , for the present study .",
    "other than increasing the number of light lsps , the fine - tuning requirements placed on this model set have no effect on the properties of lsps within this mass range .",
    "it is challenging for a @xmath19 gev neutralino lsp to generate the observed dark matter thermal relic density in the pmssm .",
    "pure winos or higgsinos of this mass annihilate very efficiently and yield extremely small values for the relic density ; they are also excluded by lep data since the lsp will necessarily be accompanied by a corresponding nearby charged state , , a chargino .",
    "pure binos require a t - channel exchange of a light sfermion , which is frequently in tension with lep or lhc bounds on light charged sparticles .",
    "a mostly - bino lsp with a mass of @xmath20 gev can annihilate through an s - channel higgs ( or h / a ) boson if it contains a significant higgsino component .",
    "however , the higgsino component also controls the coupling to the @xmath11 boson , so that @xmath11 exchange is dominant in the mass region of interest ( large couplings of the lsp to the higgs are also constrained by null results from direct detection experiments ) .",
    "the lsp coupling to the @xmath11 boson is constrained by limits on the spin - dependent dark matter direct detection cross section , and by measurements of the invisible width of the @xmath11 ( @xmath21 mev ) .",
    "interestingly , these combined constraints exclude a mixed bino - higgsino lsp with a mass below @xmath22 gev .    , in units of @xmath5s@xmath6 as a function of the lsp mass for models with @xmath23 in the @xmath3 ( top ) and @xmath24 ( bottom ) channels.,width=480 ]    , in units of @xmath5s@xmath6 as a function of the lsp mass for models with @xmath23 in the @xmath3 ( top ) and @xmath24 ( bottom ) channels.,width=480 ]    we now examine the annihilation cross section for a lsp with a bino - higgsino admixture .",
    "the top ( bottom ) panel in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] displays the present - day value of @xmath25 for the lsps in our low - ft pmssm model set annihilating in the @xmath3 ( @xmath24 ) channel .",
    "all of these models predict the correct lsp abundance , and we have selected only models with lsp masses in the interesting range .",
    "the panels show the complete calculation as performed by darksusy@xcite .",
    "looking first at the 30 - 40 gev mass range , we find that the @xmath11 exchange contribution alone is a reasonable estimator of the total annihilation rate in most cases , and predicts an annihilation rate which is 2 orders below the value of @xmath25 during freeze - out ( and therefore below the value needed to explain the fgce ) . although some points have significantly larger annihilation rates than predicted by the @xmath11 exchange diagram , these models annihilate almost exclusively to @xmath26 through t - channel exchange of light staus .",
    "bottom squarks light enough to give comparable annihilation rates are strongly excluded by collider limits .",
    "the present - day annihilation cross section decreases with increasing lsp mass because heavier lsps are able to annihilate through the @xmath11 pole in the early universe , reducing the higgsino content required to achieve the correct relic density .",
    "since the @xmath11 pole becomes kinematically inaccessible at late times ( due to low lsp velocities ) , the present - day annihilation cross section for heavier lsps is suppressed by their lower higgsino content .",
    "if we allow the lsp mass to increase further into the @xmath27 gev range as suggested by @xcite , there are several interesting features observed in this figure .",
    "as @xmath28 is approached from below , the higgsino content of the lsp also continues to decrease in order to obtain the correct relic density during freeze - out .",
    "this results in a further shrinking of the annihilation cross section observed today , down into and below the @xmath29 @xmath30 sec@xmath6 range .",
    "this is far too small to be compatible with the observed gc flux .",
    "note that the rate slowly recovers beyond the @xmath11-pole , exceeding @xmath31 @xmath30 sec@xmath6 for masses near @xmath32 gev .",
    "once the lsp mass appreciably exceeds @xmath28 then the cross section comes under the influence of the sm - like higgs resonance at @xmath33 gev .",
    "since the higgs essentially couples to the product of the bino and higgsino content of the lsp , the lsp again becomes nearly pure bino at resonance and the annihilation cross section today once again drops appreciably . above the higgs pole",
    ", the annihilation rate again recovers . for even larger masses above the higgs peak , co - annihilation with other light sparticles , , @xmath34 s ,",
    "becomes more important , but do not lead to @xmath3-rich final states .",
    "in addition to the models in the main band we see a number of outliers with somewhat larger cross sections , however none of these yield an appreciable rate into @xmath3 . from this",
    "we learn that even for dark matter in the 40 - 70 gev range , the pmssm can not reproduce the gc signal if the final state is required to be @xmath3 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1c ] , we show the behavior of @xmath35 ( _ without thermal averaging _ ) for a 35 gev majorana lsp annihilating through @xmath11 exchange , plotted as a function of the lsp velocity .",
    "since the 35 gev @xmath13 annihilates through the @xmath11 pole in this scenario , the cross section exhibits a strong velocity dependence . in the early universe ,",
    "the lsp velocity is sufficient to push the collision center - of - mass energy towards the @xmath11 pole , and the annihilation cross section can take full advantage of the resonance to generate the observed relic density . in the present era , the lsps are moving very slowly so that their annihilation takes place away from the @xmath11 pole with a cross section that is correspondingly far smaller .",
    "lsps with a slightly lower ( higher ) mass require a somewhat larger ( smaller ) coupling to the @xmath11 , since they receive , on average , less ( more ) of a boost from the pole . at present - day velocities ,",
    "the lsps are highly non - relativistic , and the kinematic enhancement of the annihilation rate for lsps close the @xmath11 mass ( but with a mass difference larger than the @xmath11 width ) essentially disappears .     for @xmath36 as a function of the velocity @xmath37 , mediated by the sm @xmath11 boson for @xmath38 gev . here , for purposes of demonstration ,",
    "the coupling of the lsp to the @xmath11 boson , which is expressed through its higgsino content via the combination of the mixing parameters for the neutralino mass matrix @xmath39 , is taken to be @xmath40 ; the cross section can be appropriately rescaled for other values of interest.,width=432 ]    we have learned two lessons from this exercise : ( @xmath41 ) the fgce can not be explained in the pmssm . given the parameter freedom in the pmssm , this result is likely to hold for any model in the mssm with a majorana neutralino lsp .",
    "( @xmath42 ) since the neutralinos are majorana fields and are required to annihilate through the @xmath11 , the cross section has a very strong velocity dependence due to the absence of vector couplings as well as the proximity of the @xmath11 pole ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "this renders it difficult , if not impossible , to generate the observed relic density while explaining the fgce .",
    "clearly it would be advantageous to avoid this strong dependence of @xmath25 on the velocity by building a model wherein the sm @xmath11 resonance is not the dominant channel for both early universe and present - day dm annihilation .",
    "another possible scenario is the mssm with dirac gauginos , which has recently gained in popularity@xcite in light of the null lhc susy search results . in this scenario",
    ", a @xmath44 35 gev lsp must be almost pure bino ( to the level of @xmath45 or smaller ) since any significant higgsino component will produce a vector coupling of the lsp to the @xmath11 boson .",
    "this , in turn , yields a very large spin - independent ( si ) direct detection cross section@xcite which is excluded by experiment .",
    "a higgsino admixture is thus not allowed , ensuring that the annihilation of the lsp does not proceed through the @xmath11 boson , which avoids the problems encountered above in the pmssm .",
    "essentially pure dirac binos can have a significantly larger @xmath46 and @xmath47channel induced co - annihilation cross section via sfermion exchange than in the corresponding case of a majorana lsp , even when the sfermion mass satisfies the lep bounds .",
    "the behavior of this cross section is easily understood once we recall that both the conventional @xmath9 and @xmath18-terms are absent in r - symmetric models , so that left and right sfermions do not mix .",
    "since the sfermions are pure electroweak eigenstates , the cross section has two contributions - one from each of the @xmath48 exchanges - and the corresponding rates will be proportional to the combinations @xmath49 , with @xmath50 being the relevant hypercharges of the @xmath48 . since both sbottoms have a smaller hypercharge than do staus ( by a factor of 3 ) , annihilation to the @xmath3 final state will be suppressed by a factor of 27 relative to annihilation to @xmath26 when the stau and sbottom masses are equal ( although we note that collider searches allow for staus to be lighter than sbottoms ) .",
    "specifically , in the @xmath51 limit , one obtains the cross section@xcite for the process",
    "@xmath52 : @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the usual sm @xmath56 hypercharge coupling .",
    "this expression shows the expected behavior . despite the hypercharge suppression , sbottom exchange ( and therefore the @xmath57 final state ) can dominate if sbottoms are much lighter than the other sfermions .",
    "the problem now becomes one of rate since collider searches@xcite constrain sbottoms to be somewhat heavy , particularly for the light lsp masses required to explain the fgce , with a limit of @xmath58 gev being extremely conservative .",
    "taking @xmath59 gev and both sbottoms degenerate with masses at their smallest possible value of 300 gev , we obtain an annihilation cross section that is too small , by a factor of almost @xmath60 , to explain the fgce or to obtain the observed relic density .",
    "( note that the annihilation cross section during freeze - out is @xmath61 larger than its present - day value due to the o(@xmath62 ) terms that were neglected in the above expression . ) explicitly , in the @xmath63 limit we obtain the result : @xmath64  @xmath5s@xmath6 .",
    "the annihilation rate would decrease further if heavier , more realistic sbottom masses were employed .",
    "clearly this scenario can not be responsible for the galactic center excess .    from the discussion above it is clear what would happen if the dark matter mass range were to be extended upward to @xmath65 gev .",
    "( 1 ) shows that if we hold all other parameters fixed , then a doubling of the dark matter mass would lead to a simple four - fold increase in the annihilation cross section which yields an adequate rate for the @xmath34-pair final state .",
    "however this relatively small increase is much too meager to achieve the required annihilation into @xmath15-quarks , remaining well over a factor of @xmath66 below the determined value .",
    "another approach is to consider a susy grand unified theory ( gut ) , extending both the gauge group and matter content of the mssm . in this case ,",
    "one of the new weakly interacting , sm - singlet neutral fermions can be the lsp and potentially a dm candidate .",
    "one attractive possibility is the susy version of @xmath8 , which can lead to an additional @xmath56 gauge group at the tev scale@xcite . here",
    ", the gut - scale breaking pattern can take the form of @xmath68 , followed by @xmath69 and then , as usual , @xmath70 breaks to the sm .",
    "a linear combination of the two additional @xmath56 groups , @xmath71 , survives to lower ( , tev - scale ) energies .",
    "in addition to the extended gauge group , the standard mssm matter and higgs content is also enlarged as both are contained in the fundamental * 27 * ( and possibly @xmath72 ) representation of @xmath8 .",
    "the * 27 * decomposes as * 16*+*10*+*1 * under @xmath73 with the sm fermions and a rh - neutrino composing the usual * 16*. within this scenario , one of the new light neutral sm singlet fields provides an appealing candidate for the lsp ; a particular realization of this is given by the choice of the @xmath73-singlet field , @xmath74 .",
    "since the lsp is a sm singlet , it must annihilate through the new @xmath75 gauge boson .",
    "the mass of the @xmath75 is required to be quite heavy , @xmath76 tev , by null results from lhc resonance searches @xcite .",
    "although the heavy @xmath75 mass avoids issues associated with direct detection , the invisible width of the @xmath11 , or the significant velocity dependence observed above in the case of the pmssm , we will see that it also leads to a problematic suppression of the annihilation rate .",
    "another drawback of annihilation through the @xmath75 is that @xmath3 is _ not _ necessarily the dominant final state for lsp annihilations .",
    "depending on model details , the lsp may be either a majorana or dirac fermion .",
    "once this choice is made , the model contains only two free parameters , the @xmath75 mass and the value of the mixing angle @xmath77 , and is therefore very predictive .",

    "note that in this case the expansion of the thermally - averaged cross section in powers of velocity is fully valid as the annihilation takes place far away from the @xmath75 pole .",
    "we see that the cross section vanishes in the limit when the @xmath75 is purely a @xmath82 state as @xmath74 is a @xmath73 singlet .",
    "whether the lsp is dirac or majorana , we see that the resulting cross section is far too small ( by at least several orders of magnitude ) to predict the correct relic abundance or explain the fgce .",
    "this results from the rather small gauge couplings in this class of models and from the requirement of a heavy @xmath75 paired with a light lsp , since the cross section roughly scales as @xmath83 .",

    "we obtain a qualitatively similar result in the case were the lsp transforms instead as the @xmath70 singlet within the @xmath73 * 16 * representation , although the detailed dependence of the cross section on @xmath77 is quite different and the cross section is now seen to vanish near @xmath84 as can be observed in fig .",

    "given the cross section scaling discussed above this would yield only an additional factor of @xmath86 in the gc flux , thus remaining too small by roughly two orders of magnitude .",

    ", such a ` simple ' scenario appears to avoid@xcite all of the pitfalls we have discussed in the previous section , since the lsp pair annihilation is no longer velocity suppressed , while the si direct detection cross section has a very strong velocity suppression@xcite .",

    "we thus require that @xmath12 exchange remains dominant over @xmath11 exchange at all times , and impose the constraint that @xmath120 .",
    "second , the higgsino mass , given by @xmath90 , must be @xmath121 gev due to lep constraints on the mass of the corresponding charged state , while the parameters @xmath122 must be less than @xmath123 to satisfy perturbativity requirements .",
    "finally , the lsp mass in this scenario is roughly given by @xmath124 gev , constraining the value of @xmath125 .",
    "at this point , we note that the dm annihilation rate through the @xmath12 boson is essentially set by the combination of couplings @xmath126 , where @xmath127 measures the weak doublet content ( , the mssm @xmath18 content ) of @xmath12 and @xmath128 measures the singlino content of the lsp .",
    "this implies that the value of @xmath125 can not be too small , otherwise the calculated relic density will be too large",

    "note that the green and cyan curves are essentially identical.,width=480 ]    from this figure we learn several crucial lessons : ( @xmath41 ) the cross section has a rather simple sensitivity to both @xmath98 and @xmath103 , ( @xmath42 ) a lower ( higher ) value of @xmath103 increases ( decreases ) the sensitivity to the @xmath12 resonance at large values of @xmath37 , and ( @xmath144 ) the result is not sensitive to the precise value of @xmath145 as long as this value is small and the center - of - mass energy of the annihilation is not too close to the resonance . to be specific for this scenario , we choose @xmath140 gev , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 , although the latter choice has very little impact as seen above .",
    "these parameter choices yield a present - day thermally - averaged cross section , @xmath148  @xmath5s@xmath6 , with an early universe freeze - out value of @xmath149  @xmath5s@xmath6 with @xmath150 , assuming that @xmath151 .",

    "it is instructive to examine the sensitivity of both the present - day and the early universe thermally - averaged cross sections to variations in the values of both @xmath159 and @xmath103 in the region of interest ; this exercise will yield information about the possible values for the remaining model parameters , such as @xmath125 .",

    "this mass ordering is reversed in the bottom panel.,width=336 ]    although we can avoid a troublesome suppression of the present - day annihilation rate , several model building requirements combine to restrict the parameter space in this scenario .",
    "we start by considering the neutralino mixing matrix more carefully .",
    "as mentioned above , we want the lsp to be mostly singlino in order to have a large coupling to the pseudoscalar singlet . in this case , the bino and wino components of the lsp are typically small since bino - singlino and wino - singlino mixing terms are absent from the neutralino mass matrix , and because lep results require the charged wino to be heavier than 100 gev .",
    "we therefore assume that the bino and wino are irrelevant and consider only the higgsino - singlino sector , which is completely specified by 4 parameters ( @xmath164 and @xmath98 ) . recalling that the lsp must have a small higgsino component to suppress the @xmath165 coupling",
    ", we see that for large values of @xmath98 , @xmath166 must be small enough that the off - diagonal entries are much smaller than the diagonal entries , @xmath167 and @xmath168 gev .",
    "specifically , the mixing is roughly set by the ratio @xmath169 .",
    "lep limits require @xmath170 gev , which demands a large value of s in the ( necessary ) case of small @xmath166 . since the lsp mass is set by @xmath171 gev , large values of @xmath88 demand small values of @xmath172 to produce the correct lsp mass .",
    "this is in tension with the the requirement that @xmath172 should be large enough to predict the correct annihilation cross section .",
    "this tension indicates the failure of this approach .",
    "while it is likely that this complete argument can be demonstrated algebraically , we have instead performed large numerical scans ( totaling @xmath173 points in the space ) over the 4 parameters relevant for singlino - higgsino mixing in order to verify our conclusion .",
    "no successful solutions were obtained , and we therefore conclude that the nmssm with @xmath10 symmetry where _ only _",
    "the @xmath12 exchange is responsible for both the dm relic density and the fgce also fails to reproduce the observations .",
    "we now examine how these conclusions are modified if the dark matter mass falls into the heavier @xmath27 gev range as discussed by calore @xcite .",
    "there are now distinct regions of parameter space to be examined , depending on the relative values of @xmath103 and @xmath159 . for the case when @xmath174 the lsp pair can annihilate into the @xmath175 final state .",
    "this will dominate over the @xmath3 mode as there is no longer any helicity suppression .",
    "this subregion is thus excluded from further consideration .",
    "if @xmath176 , the center of mass energy in the lsp pair annihilation process will be larger at freeze - out than it is today and it will occur further away from the @xmath12-pole and thus we expect the lsp annihilation rate today ( @xmath177 ) to be _ larger _ than in the early universe . for @xmath159 in the @xmath27 gev mass range , a numerical study shows that the ratio @xmath178 always lies below @xmath179 when @xmath176 .",
    "this conflicts with the requirements on the flux for the galactic center excess signal discussed above , that the current lsp annihilation rate should be at or below the value at freeze - out . from this discussion",
    "we then conclude that we must have @xmath180 , even if the lsp lies in the mass range @xmath181 gev .",
    "this being the case , all of the arguments delineated above for lsp s in the 30 - 40 gev range will still be applicable ; for example , a very small higgsino content of the lsp must still be maintained .",
    "in fact , for some lsp masses in this range , the constraint on the lsp higgsino content would need to be further _ tightened _ due to the rather close proximity of the @xmath11 pole in the annihilation process .",
    "given a fixed ( and large ) @xmath98 , the annihilation cross section scales roughly as @xmath182 , the higgsino content of the lsp is controlled by the ratio @xmath183 , and the lsp mass is arises from @xmath184 .",
    "it is clear how these quantities are modified when we consider lsp masses in the @xmath27 gev range , and , at the very least , we do nt want to further increase the tension among the parameters encountered above when we assumed @xmath185 gev .",
    "for example , if the lsp mass is 70 gev , doubling the values of both @xmath125 and @xmath103 while leaving the corresponding values of both @xmath166 and @xmath88 unchanged , we recover the same annihilation rate and higgsino content that we found in the case of @xmath38 gev and so the already unacceptable tension among the parameters discussed above is not increased ( or improved ) .",
    "however , we see that changing the values of @xmath166 and @xmath88 would only increase this tension further .",
    "thus we conclude that for lsp masses in the @xmath27 gev mass range , the @xmath10 invariant version of the nmssm will remain as finely - tuned and disfavored as it was for lighter lsp masses .      to go further we drop the requirement of the @xmath10 symmetry on the nmssm superpotential , providing greater parameter freedom .",
    "although the scale - invariant feature of the @xmath10 model is very attractive , it also poses potential domain wall problems@xcite that we now avoid .",
    "additionally , some of the attractive features of the @xmath10 model can be recovered or improved upon in the general nmssm with model - building effort  @xcite . in order",
    "to most easily discern whether this more general scenario can provide a successful description of the fgce , we first present a ( mostly ) tree - level discussion , which is important for providing the required transparency given the relative complexity of the parameter space . a more detailed numerical analysis including all corrections and a full scan over the parameter space follows in the next section .    the number of additional parameters is significantly increased in the full nmssm : first , the superpotential is augmented by terms which are either linear or quadratic in the singlet superfield @xmath87 .",
    "second , corresponding additional terms are necessarily generated in the soft - breaking lagrangian .",
    "thus we find , instead of the compact expressions above , the augmented results@xcite ( ignoring a possible bare @xmath9 term ) w _ = _ u _ d + _ f + ^^2 + ^3 , and -l _",
    "h_d s + a_s^3 + m_3 ^ 2 h_u h_d + m_s^2 s^2 + _ s s+ from these expressions we see that the general nmssm scenario introduces 5 additional new parameters ( @xmath186 ) beyond those encountered in the @xmath10 model ; only a subset of these additional parameters is required ( at least at tree level ) to describe the fgce . in the brief discussion that follows ,",
    "we assume for simplicity that @xmath187 in order to derive a workable model , but this need not be the case ; viable models can be found when these parameters are non - zero and we include them below in our full scan over the parameter space . as was shown above , the neutralino mass matrix depends on only one of these new parameters , @xmath188 , which is sufficient to resolve the difficulties we found in the case of the @xmath10-invariant nmssm . to see this",
    ", we again assume that @xmath189 are large so that the bino and wino are decoupled , and similarly assume that the value of @xmath105 is large enough to suppress higgsino - singlino mixing while the value of @xmath166 is somewhat small .",
    "this implies that large values of @xmath88 are necessary , meaning that @xmath190 is also relatively large if @xmath125 is not too small as previously discussed .",
    "we can , however , choose @xmath188 to have a similar magnitude to @xmath190 with the opposite sign , so that these terms cancel to produced a small remainder , , we assume the combination @xmath191 gev . note that a fine - tuning at the few percent level is thus required to obtain the desired lsp mass .",
    "we then perform a simple ( flat ) scan over parameters relevant for singlino - higgsino mixing , employing the scan ranges @xmath192 , @xmath193 , @xmath194 tev with @xmath195 and imposing the requirements discussed above .",
    "we obtain multiple valid solutions , demonstrating the viability of this approach .",
    "given values for the parameters @xmath196 resulting from our scan that yield a neutralino mass matrix with the desired properties , we next consider the effective @xmath197 cp - odd scalar mass matrix at tree level .",
    "we use the convenient basis where the conventional neutral goldstone boson has been removed so that the elements of this matrix are given by@xcite _ p,11 ^ 2 & = & , + m_p,22 ^ 2 & = & (b_+3s + ^ ) -3a_s -2 m_s^2 -^s -_f(4 + ) - , + m_p,12 ^ 2 & = & (a_- 2s - ^ ) v , where the combinations are defined as b _ = a_+ s , _ 3 ^ 2 = m_3 ^ 2 + ( ^s + _ f ) . note that in the absence of mixing @xmath198 gives the mass of the usual cp - odd field @xmath18 in the mssm .",
    "recall that for the purposes of this discussion , we have assumed @xmath187 , and now , for further simplicity , we will also assume that the combination @xmath199 . with these assumptions ,",
    "the only new parameters present in this matrix but irrelevant for higgsino - singlino mixing are the @xmath18-terms , @xmath200 and @xmath201 . with these assumptions",
    ", we can set @xmath202 and fix the smaller eigenvalue of this matrix to be @xmath203 ; we then obtain numerical values for the soft parameters @xmath108 and the mass of the heavier cp - odd state @xmath18 . since @xmath204 is small , this state is similar in nature to the mssm pseudoscalar boson .",
    "it is therefore constrained by searches for resonant di - tau production@xcite , and also potentially by flavor constraints@xcite such as those arising from measurements of the branching fraction @xmath205 , for the large values of @xmath98 ( @xmath206 ) considered here .",
    "we therefore avoid these constraints by requiring @xmath207 tev .",
    "this approach works quite well and multiple solutions are again easily obtainable .",

    "we employ the range @xmath212 , which is specifically chosen to avoid any tachyonic solutions for the eigenvalues of this matrix , for our scan .",
    "we require the lightest eigenvalue , which we identify as the higgs boson observed at the lhc , to have a mass @xmath213 gev .",
    "we further demand that this state must have very little mixing with the singlet higgs , , @xmath214 in the notation of ref .",
    "this requirement ensures that the observed higgs state will have properties that are very close to that of the mssm and sm higgs and , in particular , will have a small branching fraction for the decay @xmath215 ( generally @xmath216 ) , which can only proceed through the various neutralino and higgs mixings .",
    "this also reduces the observed higgs boson s contribution to the spin - independent direct detection cross section for the almost pure singlino lsp .",
    "performing a scan over the parameters @xmath217 yields many sets of parameter values ( , ` models ' ) that produce completely successful phenomenology . certainly allowing the other remaining parameters that we have ignored in our discussion to be non - zero or to float freely will also yield viable scenarios .",
    "in addition , increasing the lsp mass to 70 gev will clearly still allow for solutions .",
    "thus , at least at ( mostly ) tree level , the general nmssm can provide a phenomenologically viable description of the fgce !      to go further in our exploration of the nmssm we perform a more thorough and complete analysis incorporating , , the higher - order , loop - generated radiative corrections to the various gaugino , cp - even and cp - odd higgs mass matrices as well as the associated couplings in the nmssm . in performing this analysis",
    "we make use of a modified version of nmssmtools4.3.0@xcite and perform a scan over the general nmssm parameter space .",
    "we subject each of the randomly chosen parameter space points to the various experimental and theoretical constraints mentioned above , along with additional constraints which will be detailed in the next section , in order to find phenomenologically successful models that describe both the observed relic density and the fgce .",
    "as was noted in the previous discussion , the general nmssm contains @xmath218 new parameters beyond those already present in the mssm which we now include as part of our scan .",
    "an outline of our scan procedure is as follows . for simplicity ,",
    "we choose fixed values for the usual gaugino masses ( @xmath219 ) , the slepton soft masses , and the leptonic @xmath18-terms , and scan over the ratio of the two higgs vevs , @xmath98 .",
    "additionally , we set the nmssm parameters @xmath220 since they play no important role in this analysis .",
    "motivated by the fgce measurements and our previous discussion , we are specifically interested in particular ranges for the physical masses of the lsp , the lightest cp - odd scalar and the lightest cp - even scalar ( which we equate with the @xmath33 gev higgs as discussed above ) .",
    "we also want to constrain the mass of the heavier cp - odd field from below to satisfy constraints from lhc searches and flavor physics .",
    "we therefore eschew scanning over the fundamental lagrangian parameters @xmath188 and @xmath221 in favor of a scan over the interesting ranges of the physical masses @xmath103 , @xmath222 , @xmath223 and @xmath224 . the ( common ) squark masses and the corresponding squark @xmath18-terms are also set by choosing values for these physical masses , since suitably large radiative corrections are necessary in the nmssm ( as in the mssm ) in order to obtain a higgs mass in the @xmath33 gev range . after performing this substitution , the remaining scan parameters are just @xmath225 and the soft parameters @xmath226 . the approach that we have just outlined mimics the procedure that we followed in our tree - level discussion as closely as possible .",
    "we now discuss our scan parameters and their ranges in a bit more detail .",
    "some of the parameters are more relevant to our aim of demonstrating the existence of points that can explain the fgce than others .",
    "we therefore divide the set of parameters into `` fixed parameters , '' which are not expected to have a significant effect on the relevant physics and hence are set to reasonable values , and `` scanned parameters , '' which are scanned using a uniform distribution ( , employing flat priors ) within the ranges specified below . in nmssmtools , these parameters are defined at the scale @xmath227 and are then run to @xmath228 ( with the exception of @xmath229 , which is input at @xmath230 ) . since we choose a common squark mass parameter , @xmath231 , for our analysis , these scales are both equal to @xmath232 .",

    ". additionally , in the general nmssm , one could assign non - zero values to the lagrangian parameters @xmath236 and @xmath237 .",
    "however , as noted above , we have fixed these values to zero at the input scale .    *",
    "scanned parameters : * the remaining lagrangian parameters are chosen via a scanning procedure .",
    "these parameters , together with the ranges from which they were chosen using uniform distributions ( flat priors ) , are listed in table  [ tab : lagrangian - parameters ] .",
    "note that we perform a much broader scan of the parameters than for our tree - level study described above , since we are now interested in characterizing the phenomenologically interesting region in addition to demonstrating its existence .",
    ".summary of how the parameters of the general nmssm were chosen in our scan .",
    "the `` value '' column gives the parameter value for fixed parameters .",
    "a `` scanned '' entry in this column indicates that the parameter value was chosen randomly from a uniform distribution within the range specified by the subsequent two columns .",
    "a `` replaced '' entry indicates that the parameter value is solved for numerically to obtain desired values of the physical parameters listed in table  [ tab : physical - parameters ] . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to create a selection of viable nmssm models , we apply the set of experimental bounds listed in table  [ tab : expcon ] .",
    "these can be divided into constraints from flavor physics , higgs measurements , dark matter observables , and collider searches .",
    "the first 5 observables in the table are flavor observables that are computed by nmssmtools .",
    "this calculation includes an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty , including both parametric errors and uncertainties from missing terms in the diagrammatic expansion . for a given model , the combined uncertainty is the linear sum of the ( model - specific ) theory uncertainty and the experimental error .",
    "we designate a model as being viable if it agrees with the experimental value within this combined uncertainty .",
    "since the experimental ranges in nmssmtools are supplanted by more recent results for the flavor observables that we consider , we have modified nmssmtools to use the updated experimental results listed in table  [ tab : expcon ] .",
    "we also note that the theoretical precision of flavor observable calculations within nmssmtools does not match that of the most precise sm calculations , with the result that the sm value predicted by nmssmtools can differ from the sm values listed in table  [ tab : expcon ] . for the purposes of determining",
    "which models are excluded by flavor measurements , this fact is included in the estimated theoretical uncertainty . in our discussion , however , we will normalize the nmssmtools prediction for each observable by the corresponding sm value _ as predicted by nmssmtools _ in order to clearly show the effects which result from bsm physics , and not from e.g. different values for the ckm parameters .",
    "although nmssmtools computes the nmssm contributions to the muon magnetic moment , we do not use this observable as a constraint given the unclear status of the relevant theoretical uncertainties and the experimental agreement with the sm .",
    "we note , however , that all of the models in our final selection are within the range ( @xmath238 ) for @xmath239 , which is the region we allowed in our study of the pmssm@xcite .",
    "as noted above , we assume that the lsp is a thermal relic and accounts for all of the observed dark matter abundance . as a result ,",
    "the relic density measurement from planck and the null results from direct detection experiments place important constraints on our models .",
    "we employ the default treatment of the relic density within nmssmtools , requiring it to be within 10% of the planck observation to account for theoretical uncertainties in the relic density calculation ( the experimental errors are negligible by comparison ) . for direct detection",
    ", we use the lux limit on the spin - independent cross section , but rescale it by a factor of 4 to account for matrix element uncertainties in the nucleon , , the strange content of the proton . including such uncertainties has minimal impact on our results .",
    "spin - dependent experiments are not yet sensitive to models that remain allowed by the other constraints , so we make no explicit requirement on the spin - dependent cross section .",
    "constraints from observations of the sm - like higgs boson also set important limits on our model parameters .",
    "first , as noted above , we require that the lightest higgs mass be in the range 122 - 128 gev , assuming a 3 gev theoretical uncertainty in the higgs mass calculation@xcite with the experimental value of @xmath44 125 gev .",
    "secondly , we note that the couplings of the 125 gev higgs to sm final states ( other than @xmath57 ) are very close to their sm values in the models we consider . since the @xmath57 channel is presently poorly constrained by direct measurements , the most important effect of increasing ( decreasing ) the @xmath240 coupling in our model set is to simultaneously reduce ( enhance ) the higgs branching fractions to the other sm final states , thus altering the total observed signal strength .",
    "this same effect also provides the dominant constraint on the higgs invisible branching fraction , given the sm - like nature of the light higgs couplings . reproducing the cms measurement of @xmath241 ( , @xmath242 confidence ) , where @xmath9 denotes the relative strength of the measured higgs couplings to their sm expectations",
    "averaged over all final states , requires that the sum of the branching fractions for @xmath57 and @xmath243 final states lies between 0.468 and 0.686 . here",
    ", we neglect the direct observation of the @xmath57 final state , since the presently large errors on this measurement make this a reasonable approximation .    finally , we apply constraints arising from the non - observation of susy particles at lep and the lhc .",
    "these restrictions include an upper limit on the invisible width of the @xmath11 boson from lep , bounds on superpartner masses from both lep and lhc searches , and direct searches for scalar resonances decaying to ditau final states at the lhc . given our scan ranges for the nmssm parameters , only charginos , stops and sbottoms can _ a priori _ be in tension with either the lep or lhc data . since the masses of these sparticles are generally unimportant for the dark matter scenario we consider here , we simply avoid these collider searches by requiring charginos to be heavier than 100 gev and stops / sbottoms to be heavier than 700 gev .",
    "finally , we make use of the nmssmtools constraints on the ditau signal strength in the gluon fusion and @xmath57-associated production channels , which are derived by comparing the calculated signal strengths to the limits given in @xcite .    after applying these experimental constraints , we make the final requirement that our models provide a good explanation of the galactic center excess .",
    "as noted above , we require a lsp mass in the 30 - 40 gev range ( set by our choice of scan range ) and then further require that the present - day annihilation rate exceeds @xmath244",

    "[ fig13 ] , other final states , such as @xmath24 and @xmath318 , can also have significant rates , with the @xmath24 channel accounting for @xmath162 of the annihilation rate in many models .",
    "the bottom - right panel shows the correlation between the present - day dark matter annihilation cross section and that at freeze - out , which accounts for the observed relic density ( recall that we employed the nmssmtools version of micromegas ) .",
    "we see that the bulk of the models reside in the diamond - shaped region in the upper left corner of the panel , where the two annihilation cross sections have comparable values with the present - day rate being slightly smaller as expected .",
    "however , we also find a long tail of model points with larger freeze - out cross sections and smaller present - day annihilation rates . in these cases ,",
    "we find that @xmath103 is close enough to @xmath255 for the annihilation rate to benefit significantly from the @xmath12 pole during freeze - out , resulting in a suppression of the present - day annihilation rate which is not resonantly enhanced .",
    "some of these models also have a slightly elevated higgsino content of the lsp , so that @xmath11 exchange can also play a small role during the annihilation process in the early universe .    in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] we further examine the correlation between the present - day and freeze - out dark matter annihilation cross sections . here",
    ", the models are colored - coded by the values of the lsp mass relative to both the @xmath12 and the @xmath11 , so that we can ascertain the effects of these specific resonance exchanges . as expected ,",
    "we see in the left panel that the tail of the distribution that descends to lower present - day annihilation rates and larger rates during freeze - out occurs as @xmath255 approaches @xmath103 .",
    "this indicates that the @xmath12 pole is indeed enhancing the early universe annihilation rate for these models as we expected .",
    "interestingly , at the bottom of this long tail we find a set of models ( colored blue and green ) where the lsp is quite light relative to the @xmath12 , but where the present - day cross section is still suppressed .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] displays the same two annihilation cross sections with the points now color - coded by the ratio of the lsp and @xmath11 masses . here",
    ", the range of mass ratios is _ a priori _ narrow as the lsp was required to lie in the 30 - 40 gev mass region , however some variation is noticeable with models having lighter lsps tending to cluster on the top - left side of the distribution . in this panel",
    "we see that most of the models in the tail have masses not too far from @xmath321 so that the influence of the @xmath11 pole is likely non - negligible , accounting for the models which are far from the @xmath12 pole but still have suppressed present - day cross sections .",
    "( left ) and @xmath11 ( right ) bosons.,title=\"fig:\",width=336 ]   ( left ) and @xmath11 ( right ) bosons.,title=\"fig:\",width=336 ]",
    "lastly , we consider both the spin - independent ( si ) and spin - dependent ( sd ) direct detection cross sections for our model points in fig .  [ fig15 ] , along with the current lux and coupp constraints . the si cross section is a measure of the interaction between the lsp and the nucleus , and in this scenario is mostly due to cp - even higgs exchange resulting from mixing via , , a non - zero value for @xmath268 or a small higgsino admixture in the lsp , as well as through a possible loop - induced @xmath322 coupling .",
    "note that the @xmath323-channel exchange contribution is small since the first and second generation squarks are quite heavy in the cases we consider here .",
    "the sd interaction , on the other hand , can arise from @xmath11 exchange via the higgsino content of the lsp and/or through the exchange of the cp - odd higgs fields , although the latter process is suppressed by the values of both the mixing angles well as @xmath62 .",
    "we thus expect that both the si and sd direct detection cross sections for the singlino - like lsps in our model set will be quite small .",
    "indeed , this is what we observe in the top - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] , which shows the model density distribution in the si - sd cross section plane . here",
    "we see that typical values for the si ( sd ) cross sections are of order @xmath324 pb , both of which are several orders of magnitude away from the current experimental bounds .",
    "unfortunately only a small fraction of our model points will be accessible to future direct detection searches .",
    "the top - right panel in this figure shows how the magnitude of the sd cross section is strongly correlated with the higgsino content of the lsp , denoted here as @xmath325 and represented by the point coloration .",
    "models where the lsp has a larger higgsino content have a larger coupling to the @xmath11 boson , resulting in sizable sd scattering through @xmath11 exchange . on the other hand , we find that the si cross section is apparently not sensitive to the higgsino content of the lsp for this set of models .",
    "the bottom - left panel shows the dependence of the si and sd cross sections on the value of @xmath273 , which could be significant if @xmath326 exchange are the dominant contribution .",
    "here we see that , at most , there is a modest sensitivity implying that the sd cross section is indeed dominated by @xmath11 exchange .",
    "the bottom - right panel shows the dependence of the si cross section on the value of @xmath293 .",
    "the strong dependence of the si cross section on @xmath293 shows that the si scattering proceeds mainly through @xmath96 exchange , via the mixing between @xmath96 and the scalar singlet higgs .",
    "however , since there are , in fact , three cp - even higgs bosons of various masses and couplings contributing simultaneously to the si cross section , certain values of their masses and mixings can result in interference between the various contributions .",
    "the effect of this interference can be seen as the orange model points in the top left side of the figure , for which relatively large values of @xmath293 still result in rather small si cross sections .",

    "in this paper we have considered a set of susy scenarios , searching for a model that might lead to a consistent explanation of the fgce while also satisfying other known experimental and theoretical constraints .",
    "we began by exploring a variety of susy models which failed to describe this excess , all for different reasons .",
    "these attempts demonstrate the significant model building challenge posed by the fgce within the susy context .    in the ( p)mssm a @xmath20 gev neutralino can lead to the correct relic density only if it is a bino - higgsino admixture that annihilates near the @xmath11 pole in the early universe .",
    "remains viable .",
    "] at the present time , dark matter annihilation takes place far from the @xmath11 pole and so the prediction for the fgce flux is too small by several orders of magnitude .",
    "if the lsp were instead a dirac gaugino , this would help to increase the annihilation cross section by avoiding the velocity / helicity suppression that occurs in the majorana scenario . of course",
    ", in this case the lsp would need to be a very pure bino to avoid the direct detection constraints and so the observed relic density could only be obtained via @xmath323-channel sfermion exchange , in particular , through a right - handed @xmath34 with mass near the lep limit .",
    "given the hypercharge of the right - handed sbottom , as well as the lower bound on the sbottom mass , the desired @xmath3 final state would not occur at high enough rates to account for either the observed relic density or the fgce . in the case of an extended gauge symmetry , such as the gut theory @xmath8 ,",
    "new fermions and new gauge bosons are present so that the @xmath11-induced direct detection constraint can be avoided if the lsp were a dirac ( or even majorana ) sm singlet annihilating through a heavy new gauge boson @xmath75 .",
    "unfortunately , the lhc lower bounds on a @xmath75 mass lead to a highly suppressed dm annihilation cross section for either of the sm singlet dm candidates present in @xmath8 .",
    "we next turned our attention to the nmssm , identifying the lsp as an almost pure singlino state .",
    "we first investigated the @xmath10 version of the nmssm ( with only four new parameters beyond the mssm ) under the assumption that the dm annihilation process that produces the observed relic density ( @xmath88-channel light cp - odd higgs exchange ) is the _ same _ as that which leads to the presently observed fgce .",
    "regrettably , we showed that this scenario also proves to be inadequate to the task .",
    "this is due to the large higgsino admixture which is necessarily picked up by the lsp due to the structure of the neutralino mixing matrix , and the insufficient parameter freedom which prevents us from avoiding this mixing in this scenario .",
    "recall that once the lsp has picked up a significant higgsino component then the @xmath11 will play an important role in the dark matter annihilation process and one has to fine - tune the parameters to generate the observed relic density as well as the present - day annihilation in the galactic center .",
    "we wished to avoid such fine - tuning , motivating our assumption that cp - odd higgs exchange is solely responsible for both .",
    "lastly , we examined the general nmssm which has nine additional superpotential plus soft - breaking parameters beyond those of the usual ( p)mssm and thus has far greater flexibility . to better understand the various phenomenological requirements that the fgce imposes on this version of the nmssm",
    ", we began with an examination of this model at tree level . even in this rather simplified case we found that it was non - trivial to meet both the dark matter requirements as well as other experimental constraints .",
    "however , viable solutions were shown to exist , selecting a specific region of the parameter space . in order to perform a more complete and detailed analysis",
    ", we made use of a modified version of the nmssmtools4.3.0 code which includes radiative corrections to the various mass spectra and corresponding couplings , and also provided a means to calculate the relic density as well as the dark matter direct detection and present - day pair - annihilation cross sections in this scenario .",
    "we then generated a set of @xmath327 points in the general nmssm parameter space with rather loose range requirements , subjecting each of them to a set of global experimental constraints ( collider , flavor , astrophysical , . ) and also demanding a sufficiently large present - day dark matter annihilation cross section into @xmath3 in order to explain the fgce .",
    "of this set , @xmath245k model points survived these basic requirements , demonstrating that the general nmssm with a single dark matter annihilation mechanism provides a successful susy scenario for the fgce .",
    "we then studied the physical properties of these surviving model points in some detail .",
    "first , we examined the regions of the nmssm parameter space that led to viable models , studying in particular the role played by correlations among these parameters and the properties of the physical higgs states .",
    "one of the interesting results of this investigation is the rather wide range of possible values for the light cp - odd higgs mass , @xmath103 , ( which is correlated with the values of @xmath125 and @xmath204 , and also to some extent @xmath98 ) allowed by the constraints .",
    "since the @xmath12 has a large singlet component and the lsp is dominantly singlino , @xmath12 principally decays to lsp pairs .",
    "this makes it difficult to observe at the lhc , where searches for b - jets and missing energy face large backgrounds .",
    "although the best constraints come from di - tau resonance searches , future searches for invisible @xmath12 decays could also provide some sensitivity .",
    "in contrast ,",
    "the light cp - even , @xmath33 gev higgs generally has a rather weak , mixing - induced coupling to the lsp , so that the branching fraction for @xmath328 typically lies far below @xmath253 ; hence @xmath96 has properties quite close to that of the sm higgs , as is the case in the mssm .",
    "lastly , we studied the dark matter and flavor properties in our nmssm model set .",
    "since the lsp only couples to the sm via mixing with the higgsinos , and/or mixing amongst the higgs fields , both the si and sd direct detection cross sections are found to be quite small , , several orders of magnitude away from the current experimental bounds , in this scenario .",
    "we find that only a small fraction of our nmssm models would be accessible to future direct detection searches .",
    "rare @xmath329 decays , such as @xmath330 , can probe this parameter space to some extent .",
    "although most of the models yield branching fractions quite close to the sm prediction , there are a significant number of cases where the predictions differ from the sm by @xmath331 .",
    "once the theoretical and experimental uncertainties are under control , @xmath332 could provide a signal for this subset of models .    in summary",
    ", we find that it is non - trivial to build a uv - complete model based on susy that describes the fgce .",
    "however , we find that the general nmssm easily accommodates the data and that the data selects a specific region of parameter space .",
    "we find that increasing the lsp mass to 70 gev does not affect these conclusions .",
    "unfortunately , the signatures elsewhere , such as in higgs physics at the lhc and in direct detection , are small and will be difficult , if not impossible , to detect .",
    "it is possible that a signature could be observed in the flavor sector .",
    "indirect detection thus provides the best probe of this scenario .",
    "given that the fgce dictates the dark matter annihilation process cross section , _ fermi _",
    "should soon see some gamma ray excesses elsewhere , , in the dark matter searches using dwarf galaxies .",
    "we hope that further data will confirm the signature observed at the galactic center and that dark matter will soon be discovered !",
