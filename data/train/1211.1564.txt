    "it is well known @xcite that the mark - to - market of derivatives between counterparties that do not post collateral includes terms that take into account the possibility that some counterparty defaults before the end of the contract .",
    "these quantities represent the so - called bilateral credit valuation adjustment ( bcva ) and debit valuation adjustment ( bdva ) , and must include the effect of the first - to - default .    on the other hand ,",
    "if a collateral agreement is in place between the counterparties , neglecting the residual gap risk or assuming perfect collateralization as discussed below , it is accepted that the mark - to - market of the derivative is simply the present value of the contractual cash flows . in the following",
    "we show a way to structure a collateralized transaction such that , if one takes into account the costs of funding the collateral , a component representing counterparty risk can be recovered , that is equivalent in its form to the uncollateralized bcva@xmath0bdva , but with the default probabilities now obtained from the asset swap spreads of the parties rather than from their cds spreads .",
    "we call this term the funded bilateral valuation adjustment ( fbva ) .",
    "moreover , the collateralized transaction that originates the fbva can also be viewed as an effective way for an investor to restructure the counterparty risk of an uncollateralized transaction , reducing or avoiding the additional capital charge defined by the basel iii framework .",
    "therefore the set up we introduce below might be criticized as a way to bypass basel iii , a point we will discuss below . as far as we know , however , a financial institution is legitimate to adopt it and then the issue will have to be addressed by the regulators .",
    "[ [ this - paper - and - the - previous - literature ] ] this paper and the previous literature + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    our framework is introduced in section [ snot ] where we follow the notation of e.g.  @xcite ; in particular we will adopt the risk - free close - out amount , without affecting the validity of our results .",
    "we leave to a future work the extention to more general close - out conventions following @xcite . in section [ suni ] , while we show how our main result works in the unilateral case , we highlight that the present value of the cashflows related to margining the collateral is closely connected to the cva , a result somewhat obvious but left implicit by the literature , see for instance @xcite where margin lending are priced , and refer to @xcite for an extensive treatment of the funding valuation problem and a complete survey of the literature on this topic .",
    "unlike the latter , we will not address the subtleties of the whole inclusion of the cost of funding while pricing a transaction , being interested in the less extensive scope of including the cost of collateral in a new structuring .",
    "the spirit of our approach is similar to @xcite where the authors , however , examine the cost of funding issue in fundamental but simple transactions with upfront , i.e. synthetic loans .",
    "our main result in the general , bilateral structure is illustrated in [ sbil ] , and all the calculations , though rather simple , are postponed to the appendix . the implication of our results are discussed in section [ sdisc ] .",
    "the value for @xmath1 of a derivative contract struck between two defaultable counterparties @xmath2 and @xmath1 , when a default risk - free close - out amount convention is adopted , is @xmath3 where @xmath4^+ \\right| t \\right\\},\\ ] ] @xmath5^+ \\right| t \\right\\},\\ ] ] and @xmath6 is the stochastic discount factor between two dates , @xmath7 is the default time of counterparty @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the last payment date of the derivative , @xmath12 the loss given default of counterparty @xmath8 , and @xmath13 is the value of the equivalent default risk free derivative as seen from @xmath8 , e.g. @xmath14 with @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 the cashflow paid in @xmath18 that depends on the values of the risk factors ( e.g. interest rates , stock prices ) already known in @xmath18 .",
    "we also define @xmath19 , and we will use the notation @xmath20 , and analogous for @xmath1 , for the unconditioned probabilities . we will omit conditioning on @xmath21 henceforth .    a discrete equivalent of each of the two formulas ( [ bcva ] ) and ( [ bdva ] ) can be obtained assuming that the default can happen ( or be observed ) only at specific dates @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( e.g.  the dates in which cash flows are exchanged ) :    @xmath25^+ \\right| t \\right\\},\\ ] ]    @xmath26^+ \\right| t \\right\\}.\\ ] ]",
    "in order to enter into an uncollateralized transaction with an initial default risk free mark - to - market equal to zero , a counterparty has to receive its bilateral valuation adjustment bva = bcva@xmath0bdva , since the fair value of the derivative is @xmath0bva . on the other hand ,",
    "if the deal is collateralized , there is apparently no need of such a payment .",
    "we show in the following that by taking into account the flows related to the borrowing and lending of the collateral in a particular set up , we recover payments that are equivalent , up to the definition of default probability , to the bva .    in what follows",
    "we assume perfect collateralization , that is , both minimum transfer amount and threshold are set to zero in the standard csa agreement , and the amount of the collateral is computed daily .",
    "we neglect the gap risk of intraday price changes of the derivative and allow rehypotecation of collateral .",
    "the next paragraph is devoted to illustrate the core idea in a simplified setting , where one party is risk - free and then has to receive the cva to enter into an uncollateralized transaction with a defaultable counterparty . in a subsequent section we obtain the general formulas for two defaultable counterparties .",
    "assume for the moment that one of the counterparties @xmath27 is riskless , hence does not need to post collateral , while the other @xmath28 posts cash collateral .",
    "we would like to take into account the costs and profits related to this collateral . at any particular time",
    "@xmath29 , a has to borrow an amount of cash @xmath30^+$ ] equal to the mark to market of the derivative , if positive for @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath2 has to pay its cost of funding on this amount , that can be quantified in a risk free rate ( hereafter the eonia rate @xmath31 ) plus a constant funding spread @xmath32 which can be thought of as being related to the asset swap spread of @xmath2 .",
    "this flow of payments lasts as long as @xmath2 does not default .",
    "then @xmath2 posts the collateral to @xmath1 , usually receiving the risk free rate .",
    "also these payments are interrupted at the default of @xmath2 .",
    "the counterparty @xmath1 is now long the collateral , and can invest it either on the market , or with @xmath2 , providing precisely the amount of cash that she needed in the first place to provide the collateral . in this case",
    "@xmath1 receives @xmath33 .",

    "leg represents the derivative transaction , including the exchange of @xmath34 , whereas @xmath30^+\\cdot\\left(1-\\epsilon\\right)$ ] is a condensed notation for the margining cashflows ( at any @xmath29 , @xmath2 has posted the amount of cash @xmath30^+$ ] and receives eonia interests on it ) .",

    "cancel the counterparty risk of the original uncollateralized transaction , the no - arbitrage principle leads to conclude that ( [ cvacap ] ) is worth the cva of the derivative .",
    "however , the functional form of fcva is equivalent ( up to the estimation of the default probabilities , see the section [ sdisc ] below ) to the unilateral cva computed for the uncollateralized transactions , see appendix [ appb ] for the derivation : @xmath38^+\\right\\},\\ ] ] and comparing it with ( [ cvacap ] ) one may obtain the fair value of @xmath32 .",
    "let us point out that fcva is part of the _ fair value _ of the loan subscribed by @xmath2 to fund the collateral , and is not a component of the price of the derivative .",
    "it is a cost to @xmath2 related to the derivative in the sense that , had she not entered into the derivative transaction , she would not have requested the loan . the collateral mechanism has moved the cva from the original transaction to a loan .",
    "hereafter , we will refer to such loan as a margin loan .",
    "the next step is to assume that also @xmath1 is defaultable , so in the margin loan above we have to take into account that the possible default of @xmath1 implies the early termination of the loan .",

    "on the other hand , @xmath2 can reinvest the collateral she has received . in figure [ fig3 ] it is represented a general situation where @xmath2 and @xmath1 borrow on the market at spread @xmath42 or @xmath43 related to their funding spread , and invest on the market at an a priori unknown spread @xmath44 or @xmath45 related to the credit worthiness of the respective borrowers .",
    "again , we will refer instead to the case illustrated in figure [ fig2 ] whith @xmath2 and @xmath1 funding each other s collateral .",

    "the sets of transactions in figure [ fig1 ] or figure [ fig2 ] have interesting features and implications discussed in the following .     and @xmath1 post collateral ,",
    "that is reinvested in the market",
    ". the funding spreads @xmath42 and @xmath43 are related to their respective funding spreads , the investment spreads @xmath44 and @xmath45 depend from the credit risk of the borrowers[fig3],scaledwidth=85.0% ]    [ [ funded-vs.unfunded-transactions ] ] funded vs.  unfunded transactions + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we have shown above that the fbva has the same functional form of bva , but we argue that the evaluation of the former should involve the default probabilities implied by the asset swap spread rather than by the cds spread curve , because the fbva is related to unsecured loans .",
    "this is more evident in the unilateral case if one considers a synthetic loan derivative , with a bullet cashflow at maturity , where the margin loan is reduced to a simple loan with that cashflow as notional .",
    "therefore might be valuable for an investor to enter into the collateralized transaction assisted by the two margin loans instead of the original uncollateralized transaction , because the latter has the same cashflows of the former , but the components of fbva , namely fcva and fdva , are generally smaller than the unfunded bva ( this follows from the generally positive basis between cds and asset swap spread ) .",
    "[ [ no - new - liquidity - needed ] ] no new liquidity needed + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    remarkably , if rehypotecation of the collateral is allowed , the margin loans represent the only way to fund the transaction without the need of injecting new liquidity in the market , a problem that has led practitioners to manage funding strategies , see for instance @xcite .

    "[ mitigating - basel - iii - capital - charges ] ] mitigating basel iii capital charges + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    following the above , restructuring an uncollateralized transaction in a set of transactions including margining and the margin loans is a valuable way to mitigate the counterparty risk arising from the original transaction , the cashflows being exactly the same in case of either survivalship or default of one party ( up to the running payment of the spread , but this difference could be remedied by considering a running paid bva in the original transaction ) . indeed the components of fbva , namely fcva and fdva , are generally not as risky as the unfunded bva , because the asset swap spread used in the former is generally less risky than the cds spread used in the latter (",
    "this is due to the riskiness of the basis between the two , generally positively correlated with the two ) .",
    "[ [ avoiding - basel - iii - capital - charges - and - criticism ] ] avoiding basel iii capital charges and criticism + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    furthermore , if one party designates the margin loan at its historical cost instead of its fair value , she avoids entirely the capital charges determined by the basel iii framework .",
    "this is a consequence of having transformed the counterparty risk into a classical credit risk arising from the margin loans .",
    "the basel ii capital charge of the latter is essentially the same of the former , as they have the same exposure at default ( equal to the mark - to - market , if positive , at the time of default ) , whereas the additional requirements are not applicable being uniquely related to bilateral transactions and their impact on the balance sheet .",
    "the structure shown in figure [ fig2 ] does not tranfer the credit risk and then could be viewed simply as a cunning way to bypass basel iii , but it is only a straightforward consequence of the accounting rules in force today , which imply different impact to the balancesheet for different but financially equivalent instruments .",
    "however , regulators should consider that a financial institution could frustrate the effort of basel committee toward capital resilience and counterparty risk hedging .",
    "[ [ the - case - of - one - way - collateral ] ] the case of one - way collateral + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the case of a risk free counterparty in figure [ fig1 ] could be thought of the restructuring of a `` one - way '' collateral assisted transaction ( so called `` one - way '' csa in the isda framework ) , where the party @xmath1 already posts collateral to @xmath2 . from the point of view of @xmath1 ,",
    "this fully counterbalances the ( bilateral ) dva but leaves the ( bilateral ) cva not null .    [",

    "as known , the own risk impacts the bilateral cva through the first - to - default effect ; in the funded bilateral cva , the first - to - default effect is a consequence of the early termination of the loan triggered by one s own default , which implies that the riskier a lender is , the lower spread it will request to compensate the expected loss of the borrower until its own default .",
    "so far we have not considered the residual gap risk which in practice arises for each new margined transaction .",
    "it is usual to hedge this risk by posting to the counterparty an independent amount ( i.e.  an amount that does not depend to the mark - to - market of the transaction ) .",
    "alternatively , it could be convenient to mitigate it through netting with the margin loans themselves .",
    "this could be realized in practice by introducing a `` cross - product netting '' clause between the collateralized transaction and the margin loans .",
    "however this clause increases the credit risk related to the loans .",
    "we conclude observing that the above `` regulamentary arbitrage '' leads to a clash of two titans , respectively the fair value accounting principle of a derivative and the possibility to show a loan at its historical cost .",
    "as it is not easy to give up either of the two principles , it could be appropriate to distinguish ( at least in the capital requirements regulation ) the purpose for which the parties has entered into a derivative transaction . on one hand a new set of rules could impose the fair value accounting of the margin loans if associated to a derivative transaction negotiated for trading purposes ; on the other hand it could allow its accounting at historical cost when related to real hedging / held to maturity transactions .",
