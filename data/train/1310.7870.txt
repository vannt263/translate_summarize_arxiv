    "the results are reported in table [ table_spec_nuonly ] .",
    "the spectra from both observations do not show clear evidence for a high energy cutoff , though the @xmath43 improves slightly for epoch  2 using the cpl model .",
    "for this observation , a high energy cutoff is formally constrained as @xmath44  kev ( 90% confidence ) .",
    "an attempt to model a high energy cutoff for epoch  1 did not lead to meaningful constraints .",

    "the low energy part of the spectrum , when fitted by a single continuum component shows positive residuals below @xmath47  kev .",
    "therefore , in order to improve the modeling , we added a multicolor disk blackbody or _ diskbb _ @xcite component to both the above spectral models . due to the limited soft x - ray coverage , we fixed the value of the inner disk temperature as 0.3  kev , consistent with previous observations .",
    "the resulting @xmath48 is improved for both epochs . assuming a distance of 8.5  kpc and inclination angles between @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the flux of the disk component points to values of the inner disk radius @xmath51  @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the gravitational radius ( 14.8  km for a 10@xmath54 black hole ) .",

    "we note that the detection of the disk component in the hard x - ray spectra of black holes is common @xcite . in our case",
    ", it is quite unlikely that it can be ascribed to a calibration issue affecting the low energy response , which has been calibrated in flight against observations of the crab source , known to have a pl spectrum below 10 kev .",

    "however , following @xcite , the null distribution of the f - statistics could deviate from the nominal values when testing for the presence of a spectral feature , or the significance of an added model component .",

    "the spectrum of the seed photons is assumed to follow the wien law and is typically @xmath113  kev . for our purposes ,",
    "the shape of the seed photon spectrum is not relevant since our spectra are measured at energies @xmath114  kev .",

    "we allowed free normalization between the three different observations by including a normalization factor in all the models .",

    "the result of the fit , even if not formally acceptable , is adequate to describe the broadband shape and characterize it as dominated by a thermal comptonized component in the energy band 3 - 250 kev . adding the soft component improves the quality of all model fits",
    "; however , only for one model ( _ diskbb+pl _ ) it is possible to constrain both disk temperature and normalization .    ]",

    ", we fixed to unity the normalization of the epoch  2 observation for the _ nustar _",
    "the relative ( variable ) normalization of epochs 1 to 2 is actually found to be constant for all model fits , i.e. @xmath116=1.04@xmath790.01 .",
    "note that the value of @xmath115 accounts not only for the different flux between the two observations but also for any difference in the cross - calibration of the two instruments . finally , to better describe the departure of the spectrum from a pure pl we plot in figure  [ fig_ratios ] the data / model ratios in the energy band 3250  kev .",
    "the positive residuals at low energies are likely due to the thermal disk component , while the negative values of the ratio at high energies are due to an exponential cutoff .     for color coding of the spectra .",

    "these observations show that  presents a featureless spectrum in its hard state and is consistent with being dominated by comptonization with an electron temperature of @xmath117  kev . assuming a distance of 8.5  kpc , the luminosity of the source is @xmath118  erg  s@xmath39 , i.e. a fraction less than a few % of the eddington limit for a stellar black hole .",
    "the sensitivity of _ nustar _  constrains the strength of the reflection component to be quite low , similar to the limits which have been measured previously by @xcite , who reported a disk reflection fraction @xmath119 at the 99% confidence level .",
    "however , in contrast to these observations , the _ suzaku _  data are compatible with no high energy cutoff ( @xmath120  kev ) . this issue could be ascribed to either a genuine variation of the plasma temperature causing the cutoff energy to vary , to a different inherent mechanism for the hard x - ray emission , or to a difference in calibration with the hxd instrument .",
    "however , we note that the _ suzaku _  and _ nustar _",
    "pl slopes are similar when data are fitted without a high energy cutoff .",
    "also , a sensitivity bias is unlikely as @xcite report a _ suzaku _",

    "diskbb _ on the single _",
    "nustar _  observations and leaving @xmath102 free , the fitting procedure converges to either values @xmath121  kev with a rather strong soft component ( rather unlikely in a hard state ) , or to values @xmath102",
    "@xmath122  kev , yielding normalizations similar to what was observed by _",
    "suzaku_. @xcite also report the presence of a soft component in the hard state during an observation in 2005 by _ xmm / newton _ , with an inner disk color temperature close to 0.25  kev .",
    "our upper limits on the ew of a 6.4  kev fe  line are consistent with the ones reported by @xcite , who found 8  ev with _",
    "suzaku_/xis , and by @xcite , who measured ew@xmath123  ev with asca .",
    "@xcite also report a line with ew=19@xmath124  ev with observations by _ rxte_/pca .    at the highest energies we can compare our observations with the available measurements from _ integral_/spi .",
    "these observations , described in @xcite , point to the presence of two different spectral components , of which the lower in energy is well described by thermal comptonization with a cutoff energy of @xmath125140  kev .",
    "the higher energy component is above @xmath125200  kev .",
    "we did not detect this component : fitting our _ nustar_/_integral _  spectrum with a two temperature model , in which the seed photon temperature of the high energy component is equal to 30  kev as in @xcite , the 90% upper limit flux for the high energy excess is 4@xmath126  erg  s@xmath39  @xmath9 in the 20250  kev band .",
    "this value , scaled by the intensity measured by spi , is @xmath127% higher than the flux of this component reported by these authors .",
    "our observations are then substantially in agreement with those of @xcite for the highest energies .",
    "there are several possible reasons for the low level of reflection from .",
    "if the accretion disk is close to the isco and the upper layers of the disk are close to being fully ionized , the reflection would be non - negligible but the shape of the reflected spectrum could be quite similar to that of the directly radiated flux ( see e.g. figure  [ fig_reflionx ] ) . in this case , it would be quite difficult to detect it .",
    "furthermore , fe lines and edges can be significantly broadened by additional doppler and relativistic effects .",
    "conversely , if the disk is recessed , the geometry and positioning of the corona relative to the disk could play a role and likewise for the ( unknown ) disk inclination .",
    "a low level of reflection is also expected if a substantial part of the hard x - ray spectrum is generated in an outflow @xcite .",
    "however , the mechanism of acceleration in an outflow or jet and its connection to the hot disk corona are presently not understood and so , also the relative contribution of the jet component . the hard tail detected by @xcite could be non - thermal and associated with a jet , similar to the high energy polarized component in cyg x-1 . in this case",
    "we could have a scenario in which the bulk of hard x - rays are indeed produced by a hot corona up to @xmath14  kev , with a jet dominating emission at higher energies .",
    "for  we report clear evidence for a high energy cutoff , which is a typical signature of a thermal electron plasma . however , this scenario is not the only one that is consistent with such a cutoff .",
    "the emergent spectra computed by jet models could also contain high energy exponential cutoffs in the region from @xmath125100 to a few hundred kev , generated , e.g. , by synchrotron cooling as described in @xcite .",
    "these features can also be produced by comptonized emission from regions within the jet @xcite or at the base of it @xcite .",
    "for the jet model of @xcite , the interplay of the direct synchrotron and comptonized components controls the hardening of the spectrum above 10 kev , which is commonly ascribed to reflection in a corona / disk model .",
    "if such hardening is not present , as in the case of , the synchrotron emission component could be dominant .",
    "however , we emphasize that in our case it is not possible to provide any direct evidence of synchrotron emission or non - thermal comptonization , and our broadband spectrum in the range 3250 kev is well described by inverse compton radiation by a hot , optically thin thermal plasma plus a soft disk component .",
    "we have analyzed spectra of the well known microquasar , located in the vicinity of the gc using the _ nustar _   telescope and the hard x - ray instrument ibis / isgri on board _",
    "integral_. during the observations , the source was in a typical low / hard state .",
    "we have analyzed _ nustar _",
    "spectra from two different observations ( taken about two weeks apart ) and found that they are fully consistent .",
    "the _ nustar _  and ibis / isgri data , spanning a time range of @xmath128  months , are also well in agreement both for the spectral modeling and for the relative normalization .",
    "the broadband spectrum in the range 3250  kev is essentially modeled by a component that is consistent with comptonization with a thermal energy cutoff @xmath129  kev .",
    "the _ nustar _",
    "power spectrum is compatible with what was previously observed by _ rxte _",
    "@xcite and also rms variation is detected at the level of @xmath130% .    at the softest energies , near 3  kev",
    ", there is some evidence for a soft component . although we can not obtain a reliable measure of the disk temperature and inner radius , due to both the low threshold of 3  kev and the shortness of the _ nustar _",
    "observations , the disk component observed is quite compatible with previous observations by _",
    "suzaku_. conversely , the detection of a high energy cutoff points to a possible change in the physical conditions of the plasma in the comptonizing corona ( we also note that a state change occurred shortly after these observations ) .    the very high sensitivity of _ nustar _  has allowed us to characterize in detail the spectrum of this source up to @xmath12570  kev and combining _ nustar _  and _ integral _  provides a determination of the overall properties of the broadband emission .",
    "the complementarity of _ nustar _  and _ integral _  is excellent for the study of the properties of black holes in the low / hard state , for which the bulk of the emission is in the energy range @xmath131  kev . in the case of",
    ", we were able to rule out a single pl model for the broadband spectrum .",
