    ", it is shown in proposition  3 that if a copula - based dependence parameter @xmath192 is expressed in terms of a non - decreasing functional of @xmath8 , the plug - in rank estimator @xmath171 has a smaller asymptotic variance than the corresponding estimator @xmath173 which assumes knowledge of the marginal distributions .",

    "these findings are interesting from a theoretical perspective .",
    "they provide broad conditions under which inference on copula - based parameters can be improved when raw observations are replaced by ranks .",
    "the gains in efficiency come from the estimation of the marginal distributions , which are nuisance parameters in this context .",
    "the present results thus provide a new illustration of the paradoxical effect that nuisance parameters sometimes have on the efficiency of estimators ; for additional discussion and examples arising in regression , see @xcite and references therein .    at the moment",
    ", however , the practical implications of the results remain unclear .",
    "as mentioned by a referee , no procedures are currently available for testing that data arise from an ltd copula .",
    "the only contribution along these lines seems to be @xcite , where a test of the weaker condition pqd is considered .",
    "while the development of an ltd test would clearly be of interest , it is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "but it may be worth pointing out that whatever the underlying copula , inequality @xmath61 can not be reversed . for , the limit @xmath42 of the empirical copula process is a `` tucked brownian sheet '' that vanishes everywhere on the border of @xmath5 ^ 2 $ ] , whereas the limit @xmath25 of the empirical process is identically zero only on the set @xmath193 or @xmath194 or @xmath195 .",

    "the conclusion from proposition  2 is considerably weaker .",
    "an extension of proposition  @xmath62 to arbitrary dimension @xmath201 would also be valuable but seems difficult . for , the proof detailed in the appendix uses the fact that for all @xmath27 $ ] , @xmath202 for specific choices of functions @xmath203 , @xmath204 , @xmath205 . under the conditions of proposition  @xmath62 , one can show that the right - hand side of @xmath206 is non - negative by matching each @xmath203 with a specific @xmath204 , depending on the relative position of @xmath27 $ ] . in the @xmath207-variate case , however , there are @xmath208 terms of type @xmath209 but only @xmath210 terms of type @xmath211 , making it impossible to extend the technique used in the proof .",
    "nevertheless , it is shown in the appendix that inequality @xmath61 continues to hold at independence in higher dimensions .",
