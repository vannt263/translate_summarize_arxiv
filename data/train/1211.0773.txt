    "to achieve a reliable imaging of thin inclusions and cracks still remains a challenging problem in the area of electromagnetic non - destructive evaluation .",
    "this is true even if simple models of those defects are chosen , e.g. , each is assimilated with a thin ( with respect to the wave length of the probing electromagnetic field ) , homogeneous penetrable layer which extends around a properly smooth supporting curve , transmission conditions being satisfied at its boundary , with the limiting case of impenetrability being taken care of as well . yet",
    ", ill - posedness and inherent nonlinearity of the inverse problem at hand often impair that achievement .",
    "so , over a number of decades , many imaging methods have been suggested .",
    "almost all are based on least - square minimization iterative schemes , so consequently , initial guess close enough to the unknown defect and suitable regularization tuned to the problem at hand are essential . without",
    ", one might suffer from the occurrence of several minima , large computational costs , and so on .",
    "recently , music ( multiple signal classification)-type , non - iterative algorithms have been developed in order to overcome some of these difficulties .",
    "they aim at the retrieval of the location and shape of penetrable , electromagnetically thin inclusions as well as the one of perfectly conducting ones at a fixed single frequency . from several results in @xcite ,",
    "such music algorithms appear both fast and robust , while easily extending to several disjoint inclusions .",
    "however , whenever applied to limited view data ( one can not illuminate the unknown inclusions from all around neither collect the scattered fields all around ) , for example , when those inclusions are embedded within a half space , emitters and receivers being set above it , retrievals are much poorer , as is seen in @xcite for either volumetric inclusions or thin ones . yet , recently , an effective and robust multi - frequency algorithm has been proposed so as to find the location of small cracks @xcite but a suitable algorithm for extended ones appears still in need .    the purpose of the present paper is to propose an effective , non - iterative imaging algorithm which is able to work on limited view data in order to retrieve electromagnetically penetrable thin inclusions buried within a homogeneous ( lower ) half space .",
    "it is based on the fact that the multi - static response ( msr ) matrix which one can collect in that setting ( at least samples of it ) can be modeled via a rigorously derived asymptotic expansion formula of the scattering amplitude in the presence of the inclusions . a number of numerical simulations",
    "will then illustrate how the proposed imaging algorithm operated at several frequencies behaves , and enhances the performance of imaging that would be based on the statistical hypothesis testing , refer to @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec2 ] ,",
    "the two - dimensional direct scattering problem is sketched and the asymptotic formula for the scattering amplitude are introduced . in section [ sec4 ] ,",
    "the multi - frequency based non - iterative imaging algorithm is outlined . in section [ sec5 ] ,",
    "the numerical results are shown .",
    "a short conclusion follows ( section [ sec6 ] ) .",
    "in this section , we briefly discuss the two - dimensional , time - harmonic electromagnetic scattering from a thin inclusion buried in a homogeneous half space .",

    "let us define the lower half space and the upper half space represented as @xmath0 respectively .    a thin penetrable inclusion ,",
    "@xmath1 is fully embedded in the homogeneous space @xmath2 .",
    "it is curve - like , i.e. , it is localized in the neighborhood of a curve : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a simple , smooth curve contained in @xmath2 , with strictly positive distance from the boundary , @xmath5 , @xmath6 is a unit normal to @xmath4 at @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is a small ( with respect to the wavelength of the electromagnetic field in the embedding space at the given frequency of operation @xmath9 ) , positive constant which specifies the thickness of the inclusion , refer to fig .",

    "thanks to various numerical simulations , it is shown that the proposed algorithm is both effective and robust with respect to random noise . moreover , it can be easily applied to multiple inclusions . nevertheless , some improvements are still required , e.g. , when the sought inclusion is of large curvature or has a significantly smaller value of permittivity ( or permeability ) than , say , another nearby .",
