    "information - theoretic secrecy analysis is now a very well established field ( see , e.g. , special issue on information theoretic security , _ ieee trans .",
    "inf . theory _ , june 2008 and references therein ) .",
    "a vast body of this literature is focused on secrecy metrics and information - theoretic secrecy guarantees for messages from passive and active adversaries .",
    "although information - theoretic secrecy is of considerable interest , there is still a disconnect between the domain of information - theoretic secrecy and that of computational secrecy methodologies in cryptography .",
    "this disconnect , along with conservative rate guarantees , have meant that information - theoretic secrecy has found only a limited number of applications .    in recent years",
    ", a bridge between cryptography and information theory has emerged in the form of channel state - dependent key generation @xcite . in this line of work , a state dependent channel ( such as the wireless channel )",
    "is considered , and a function of this state is intended to be a ` shared secret ' between the legitimate transmitter ( alice ) and legitimate receiver ( bob ) while aiming to keep the eavesdropper ( eve ) as much in the dark as possible .",
    "we intend to provide information - theoretic guarantees to the extent to which such a shared secret can be realized for our system model .",
    "once obtained , this shared secret can now be employed to seed numerous symmetric key cryptosystems  @xcite .",
    "another relevant setting where our results will be of significant interest is in cognitive radio systems  @xcite . in this scenario , the cognitive encoder ( alice ) facilitates the secure communication of the primary signal ( the state sequence of the channel ) by amplifying the signal at the primary receiver ( bob ) while masking it from the eavesdropper ( eve ) .",
    "more generally , this setting belongs to user cooperation or relaying architectures that increase / decrease the security of the communication systems @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a state dependent broadcast channel model with two users , and consider the question of to what extent the state of the channel can be amplified at the receiver ( bob ) and masked from the other receiver ( called as eve ) . in the best case , the state(s ) seen by bob and eve will be completely different ( independent ) .",
    "however , we consider what might be a pessimistic model where there is a single channel state defining the channel for both bob and eve . moreover , the entire channel state sequence is presumed to be known non - causally to the transmitter ( a gelfand - pinsker - style assumption @xcite ) .",
    "the only manner in which an asymmetry can be affected between bob and eve is by the encoding used at the transmitter .",
    "for such a system , we aim to characterize the trade - off between the  amplification \"- rate at which the legitimate pair can operate and the  leakage \"- rate to the eavesdropper . in essence , as long as there is a non - trivial difference between the two , this can be used to develop shared keys and enable cryptographic algorithms . more specifically",
    ", we define the measure differential amplification capacity as the maximal knowledge difference regarding the state of the channel between bob and eve .",
    "this metric transforms the two - dimensional amplification - leakage trade - off to a single dimension , and can be viewed as a bound on the secrecy that can be leveraged from the channel state knowledge difference . in this form ,",
    "the problem at hand is very much related to the generation of secrecy using sources and channels . here ,",
    "not only the source in the model is the channel state ( different from the models studied in  @xcite ) , but also it is non - trivially combined with the encoded signals of alice ( via the state dependent channel ) to produce the observations at bob and eve .",
    "hence , our formulation can be closely associated with the problem of secret key agreement over state dependent channels  @xcite . in such problems ,",
    "one is interested in the design of coding strategies that allow an agreement of secure bits between the legitimate users utilizing the state dependent channel .",
    "for example , sending secure bits over the channel will increase the secret key rate  @xcite . on the other hand , the problem studied in this work , when specialized to the differential amplification metric , considers only the channel state knowledge difference and provides a bound on the secret bits that can be extracted only from the channel state ( @xcite ) . in general , we are not only interested in the knowledge difference , but also in the entire rate trade - off region , which constitutes the main focus of this paper .",
    "consider a discrete memoryless channel given by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the channel input , @xmath2 is the channel state , and @xmath3 is the channel output , with @xmath4 corresponding to the legitimate receiver ( bob ) and @xmath5 the eavesdropper ( eve ) .",
    "the channel is memoryless in the sense that @xmath6 and the state sequence is independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) according to a probability distribution indicated by @xmath7 .",
    "it is assumed that the channel state sequence is non - causally known at the transmitter .",
    "( the system model is depicted in fig  [ fig : model ] . )",
    "the task of the encoder is to  amplify \" the state sequence at bob ( channel output @xmath8 ) and to  mask \" the state sequence from eve ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "formally , we measure the former by the state amplification rate @xmath10 and the latter as the state leakage rate @xmath11 .",
    "we say @xmath12 is achievable , if for any given @xmath13 , @xmath14 @xmath15 for sufficiently large @xmath16 .",
    "the problem is to characterize all achievable ( @xmath10,@xmath11 ) pairs , which we denote by the trade - off region @xmath17 .",
    "the performance of the encoder is also quantified by measuring the difference between the achievable amplification and leakage rates .",
    "the _ differential amplification rate _",
    "@xmath18 is said to be achievable if @xmath19 for some @xmath20 .",
    "the maximum value of the differential amplification rate is called as the _ differential amplification capacity _ , denoted by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 note that this quantity is important for applications like key agreement from the state of the channel , as this difference measures the knowledge difference between the two receivers regarding the state of the channel .    a cost constraint",
    "may also be imposed on the channel input with @xmath23 where @xmath24 defines the cost per input letter and the expectation is over the distribution of the channel input . in this scenario ,",
    "we say @xmath12 is achievable under the cost function @xmath25 and cost @xmath26 , if , , and are satisfied in the limit of large @xmath16 .",
    "( we use this constraint for the gaussian channel , where the cost is the average transmitted power . )    * remark : * one can say that the equivocation rate @xmath27 is achievable , if the signaling scheme satisfies @xmath28 and , correspondingly consider the achievable @xmath29 pairs .",
    "hence , the problem can be re - stated in terms of equivocation rate , where we seek to characterize all achievable @xmath29 pairs in the limit of large @xmath16 .",
    "since both the equivocation and leakage rate notions characterize the same trade - off , both notions can be used interchangeably .",
    "the problem of communication over state dependent channels is studied by gelfand and pinsker @xcite , where a message has to be reliably transmitted over the channel with non - causal state knowledge at the transmitter .",
    "the gaussian version of the problem is solved in @xcite through the famous dirty paper coding scheme .",
    "while the wiretap channel is introduced and solved in @xcite , these results are extended to a broadcast setting in @xcite .",
    "the problem of sending secure messages over state dependent wiretap channels is studied in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the problems of state amplification and state masking are individually solved in  @xcite for point - to - point channels .",
    "both  @xcite and  @xcite consider the problem of reliable transmission of messages in addition to state amplification and state masking respectively . in this paper",
    ", we consider the problem of amplifying the state to a desired receiver while trying to minimize the leakage ( or mask the state ) to the eavesdropper .",
    "we note that , if we set @xmath30 in our problem definition , it reduces to the state masking problem as studied in  @xcite . in other words ,",
    "@xmath31 can be shown to be achievable  @xcite . also , when @xmath32 , the problem reduces to a state amplification problem  @xcite , and one can achieve the following rate pair .",
    "@xmath33    these represent two extremes of the trade - off region between the amplification and masking rates . in this paper , we aim at developing an understanding of this trade - off region through achievable regions and outer bounds , and characterizing special cases when they match .",
    "our main results can be summarized as :    * * achievable regions : * our achievability arguments are based on enumerating typical state sequences using two indices , and sending one of the indices over the channel . towards this end , we construct a codebook corresponding to the codeword carrying this index ( denoted by @xmath34 ) in such a way that reliable communication can be achieved over the state - dependent channel .",
    "subsequently , we derive expressions for achievable amplification and leakage rates by determining single - letter bounds on @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively , and the achievable region is established over the input probability distributions @xmath37 .",
    "the bounds show that the rate of the message index not only amplifies the @xmath10 , but also increases the leakage @xmath11 , thereby establishing a trade - off for implementation . *",
    "* secure refinement : * we also show that it is possible to extend the proposed region with _ secure refinement _ when bob observes a  stronger \" channel than eve . in precise terms , this corresponds to instances of @xmath37 satisfying @xmath38 . note that a channel is said to have a less noisy structure if @xmath38 for all input probability distributions  @xcite .",
    "we find that the utilization of the notion of secure refinement approach is critical to such channels , and we show that the leakage due to transmission of the message can be minimized by securing ( a part of ) the message . * * special classes of channels : * our outer bound arguments are based on upper bounding @xmath35 and lower bounding @xmath36 . the achievable schemes and outer bounds presented",
    "are used to establish optimality results for a class of channels .",
    "in particular , we show that the proposed scheme achieves the optimal differential amplification capacity ( i.e. , the maximum value of @xmath39 over the set of achievable @xmath12 pairs ) for the reversely degraded discrete memoryless channel ( dmc ) , the degraded binary channel , and the degraded gaussian channel . * * gaussian channels : * we characterize the corner points of the region for the degraded gaussian channel . in this scenario",
    ", we further bound the gap between achievable and converse regions , and show the following : let us denote the message capacity of bob s channel as @xmath40 and that of eve s channel as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) is the signal - to - noise ratio of bob ( respectively , eve ) .",
    "then , for any given leakage rate @xmath11 , the gap between the upper and lower bounds on the amplification rate @xmath10 is bounded by @xmath44 .",
    "similarly , for any given amplification rate @xmath10 , the achievable leakage rate is within @xmath45 of the lower bound on @xmath11 . in particular ,",
    "the corresponding gaps are within half a bit when @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : mainresults ] presents our main results , where we provide our proposed coding schemes and outer bounding arguments .",
    "section  [ sec : dmc ] provides optimality discussions and numerical results for special classes of dmcs including the reversely degraded channel , modulo additive binary channel model , and the memory with defective cells model .",
    "the gaussian channel model is considered in section  [ sec : gauss ] along with corresponding optimality results .",
    "finally , we conclude the paper in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the proofs are collected in appendices to improve the flow of the paper .",
    "we have the following propositions for any given @xmath7 and the channel @xmath0 .",
    "the scheme presented below is based on communicating a covering of the state sequence while ensuring that the covering is decodable at bob .",
    "we have the following result .",

    "we note that , provided @xmath52 , the covering codeword can be decoded at bob .",
    "then , the state uncertainty can be reduced from @xmath53 to @xmath54 by listing @xmath55 sequences that are jointly typical with @xmath56 .",
    "this will give rise to the expression @xmath57 , as presented in the proposition .",
    "( leakage expressions follow by a similar argument , where @xmath34 sequence is added to the expression @xmath58 to derive the achievable leakage expressions . )      in order to achieve a better rate region , the encoder can send a message over the state dependent channel , where the message carries partial information about the state sequence .",
    "the corresponding achievable region is given by the following result .",
    "[ thm : rin2 ] let @xmath59 be the closure of the union of all @xmath49 pairs satisfying @xmath60 over all distributions @xmath37 . then , @xmath61 .",
    "see appendix  [ app : rin2 ] .",
    "the achievable rate region can be interpreted as follows : the rate @xmath62 corresponds to the gelfand - pinsker message rate that can be reliably communicated over the channel .",
    "as long as this rate is positive for a given input probability distribution , the codeword @xmath34 can be reliably communicated over the channel .",
    "bob can decode @xmath34 from @xmath8 by employing a jointly - typical decoder .",
    "subsequently , the state uncertainty can be reduced from @xmath53 to @xmath54 by listing @xmath55 sequences that are jointly typical with @xmath56 .",
    "further , the rate @xmath62 provides an additional refinement to the uncertainty , which together with @xmath57 sums to @xmath63 .",
    "( see also  @xcite , where the authors show that it is possible to interpret this scheme as a source coding method with wyner - ziv coding  @xcite . )",
    "the analysis of @xmath11 follows by analyzing an upper - bound on the leakage rate by adding the codeword sequence to the expression , @xmath64 , which can be single - letterized as given in appendix  [ app : rin2 ] .",
    "we observe that the leakage expression can be enhanced when @xmath65 , and this is detailed in the following proposition .",

    "( sketch of the proof ) the requirement of @xmath65 enables the decodability of @xmath34 at eve .",
    "then , using arguments similar to those used for the amplification bound in the proof of proposition  [ thm : rin2 ] ( and upper bounding the inequalities from to by reversing the ones given in to ) , we obtain the @xmath11 bound as @xmath72 further , by choosing @xmath73 we have the desired result .",
    "the three results above ( propositions  [ thm : rin1 ] ,  [ thm : rin2 ] , and  [ thm : rin2enhancement ] ) is combined in the following theorem .",
    "[ thm : rin3 ] let @xmath74 be the closure of the union of all @xmath49 pairs satisfying @xmath75 over all distributions @xmath37 satisfying @xmath76 .",
    "then , @xmath77 .",
    "remarkably , this representation also shows that the covering strategy is a special case of the state enhanced messaging approach ( when @xmath78 is chosen ) .",
    "we also note that , in the region above , increasing @xmath79 will not only increase the amplification rate but will also increase the leakage rate .",
    "thus , for some scenarios , implementing only the covering scheme might be advantageous .",
    "further implications of this observation on the amplification - leakage region is discussed in section  [ sec : revdegdmc ] .      consider all input distributions @xmath37 satisfying @xmath38 . for such distributions , it is possible to send refinement information securely over the channel .",
    "this way , the leakage increase due to refinement index is decreased as the security of the index will lower the corresponding leakage rate achieved at eve compared to the non - secured case .",
