    "of the known extra - solar planets , more than 60 transit the host star . of these systems , at least four show evidence for an external companion ( gj 436 , @xcite ; hat - p-13 , @xcite ; hat - p-7 , @xcite and corot-7 @xcite ) .",
    "if the transiting planet were the only planet in the system , then the period between each successive transit would be constant ( neglecting complicating effects such as general relativity , stellar oblateness and tides ) .",
    "the presence of additional planets in the system ( which themselves may or may not transit the star ) can cause perturbations to the orbit of the transiting planet , leading to detectable transit timing variations ( ttvs ) of the known transiting planet @xcite .",
    "other studies have extended the ttv method to demonstrate the feasibility of detecting planetary moons @xcite and trojan companions @xcite in extra - solar planetary systems .",
    "however , practical use of ttvs as a detection tool requires the solution of the difficult `` inverse problem '' , i.e. given a particular ttv profile , can one reconstruct ( or at least restrict ) the mass and orbit of the unseen perturber ?",
    "this problem is non - trivial , as numerous different perturber mass - orbit configurations can lead to degenerate ttv solutions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "several investigations have considered ( and ruled out ) planets more massive than the earth in certain orbits / regions of parameter space close to many of the known transiting planets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while @xcite and @xcite have developed an approximate analytic method to try and tackle the inverse problem in a more general manner .",
    "however , most previous investigations have focused on analyzing the effect of prograde , coplanar companions . even where explicit investigations of inclination effects have been conducted ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the investigations have been restricted to prograde cases , examining only relative inclinations significantly lower than @xmath6 .",
    "there are several reasons to consider ttvs of inclined systems .",
    "observationally , it is possible to measure the sky - projected angle between the spin vector of a star , and the orbital angular momentum vector of a planet transiting that star via the rossiter - mclaughlin effect .",
    "measurements over the past year have revealed that a number of the known transiting planets are strongly inclined , or even retrograde ( e.g. hat - p-7b , @xcite and @xcite , as well as wasp-17b , @xcite ) .",
    "although the mechanism(s ) driving the creation of such retrograde planets remains unclear , models used to explain high _ eccentricity _ exo - planets via planet - planet scattering @xcite and/or kozai oscillations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can naturally excite large orbital _ inclinations _ ( although the quantitative details of the distributions can differ greatly ) .",
    "other mechanisms such as inclination - pumping during migration ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may also contribute .",
    "in addition , previous dynamical studies have suggested that systems of prograde and retrograde planets are _ more _ stable than standard prograde - prograde cases @xcite , essentially because the planets spend less time `` close together '' and thus perturbations are smaller .    given the observational evidence for highly inclined and retrograde systems , and the suggestion of enhanced stability in such systems , we investigate and quantify the hypothesis that retrograde systems will have a significantly reduced ttv profile compared to a standard prograde case .",
    "we consider a fiducial system consisting of two planets : a transiting hot - jupiter ( with mass @xmath7 , eccentricity @xmath8 and semi - major axis @xmath9 ) and a small non - transiting , earth - mass planet which perturbs the transit times of the larger planet .",
    "we evolve each system forward in time for @xmath10 years , equating to @xmath11 transits of the jupiter - mass planet ( assuming that hot - jupiter remains transiting throughout ) .",
    "we perform the n - body integrations using a conservative bulirsch - stoer integrator , derived from that of mercury ( chambers 1999 ) .",
    "we use a barycentric coordinate system and limit the time steps to no more than 0.04 times the orbital period . after each time step , we test whether the projected star - planet separation ( @xmath12 ) passed through a local minimum and the planet in question is closer to the observer than the star . each time these conditions are met , we find the nearby time that minimizes @xmath12 via newton - raphson iteration and increment an index @xmath13 .",
    "if the minimum @xmath12 is less than the stellar radius , then we record the mid - time of the transit , @xmath14 .",
    "observations of transit times are perturbed by the light travel time , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the barycentric vector of the planet at time @xmath17 , @xmath18 is a unit vector pointing to the observer , and @xmath19 is the speed of light .",
    "the observable transit time variations are calculated as @xmath20 , where the constant @xmath21 and @xmath22 are determined by linear least squares minimization of @xmath23 .",
    "we neglect any motion of the stellar center between the time of light emission and the time of transit .",
    "in  [ resultsfixedmaps ] and [ resultsvarying ] we produce ttv contour maps in @xmath24 and @xmath25 parameter - space .",
    "these plots are produced by fixing the mass and the initial orbit of the transiting hot - jupiter ( @xmath8 & @xmath26 ) , and then varying the orbit of the earth - mass perturber .",
    "for each set of configurations - i.e. semi - major axis , @xmath27 , eccentricity , @xmath28 , & inclination , @xmath29 of the perturbing planet - we conduct 5 simulations randomising the other orbital elements ( argument of pericentre , @xmath30 , longitude of ascending node , @xmath31 , & initial mean anomaly @xmath32 ) .",
    "we then calculate the rms of @xmath33 for each @xmath34 configuration .",
    "the required contour plots are then plotted using an approximately logarithmic color scale ( shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fiducial_inc_scan ] and [ fig : fiducial_inc_1 ] ) .",
    "we restrict our simulations to the region defined by the prograde coplanar three - body hill stability criterion of @xcite .",
    "this ensures that all of the @xmath35 simulations are stable , and ensures for the @xmath36 systems that we have covered all of the guaranteed stability zone _ and more _ ( see @xcite for a discussion of the stability limit as a function of inclination ) . as an additional check on systems with extremely large ttvs close to the hill - stability criterion boundary",
    ", we conducted 1,000 longer - term mercury simulations . in most cases the earth - mass planet experiences significant changes in semi - major axis within 1,000 years , due to the `` kicks '' at pericentre passage .",
    "thus , although these planets do not collide , the less massive planet can experience some orbit variation .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     ( -555,-120 )    ( -340,-190)*semi - major axis ratio ( @xmath37 ) . *    finally ,",
    "for completeness we consider an earth - mass planet on an orbit _ interior _ to the jupiter - mass planet , keeping the more massive planet at @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and then monitor the ttvs of the massive planet due to the interior perturber .    from fig [ fig : int_res ]",
    "it seems that the background ( non - resonant ) regions now retain an approximately constant ttv signal irrespective of inclination , while there is a tendency for the ttv signal to become _ stronger _ around the mmr regions as the inclination is increased towards @xmath6 , but then drop away to almost nothing as the inclination further increases towards @xmath40 .",
    "we have investigated the ttv signals for systems of highly inclined and retrograde planets .",
    "we find that :    * in the vicinity of exterior mmrs the inclination dependence is complex : low order resonances maintain a high ttv amplitude for all regions @xmath41 , declining in amplitude only for low eccentricity cases close to @xmath40 , where - as higher order resonances display an increase in ttv amplitude as inclinations rise from 0 to 45 degrees . moreover , the regions immediately adjacent to mmrs show extreme sensitivity to changes in perturber @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath13 .",
    "* exterior perturbers away from resonances tend to show a slow decrease in ttv amplitude with increasing inclination , although regions adjacent to resonances can show remarkably complex behaviour .",
    "* perturbing planets on interior orbits display a slightly different behaviour : away from resonance the amplitude remains approximately constant with inclination , but around mmrs the perturbations become _ stronger _ as the inclination increases towards @xmath6 before decreasing again beyond @xmath6 .      *",
    "absence of evidence is not evidence of absence : planets in retrograde orbits should be expected to produce markedly reduced ttv signals as compared to the standard prograde case . for an earth - mass perturber in an anti - aligned orbit , almost the entirety of the sample parameter space would result in a very small or undetectable ttv signal ( unless the planet happened to be fortuitously located precisely on a strong mmr ) .",
    "* retrograde orbits may be a natural way to explain transiting systems in which little or no ttv signal is observed , but in which the radial velocity observations point towards the existence of an additional planetary companions ( e.g. gj 436 , hat - p-13 , etc ) . * in addition to the ttv considerations in this work , it is important to acknowledge that inclined orbits in multi - planet systems will precess , leading to variations in transit duration .",
    "more work is required to try and understand whether a combination of ttv signals with transit _ duration _ variation signals could remove some of the degeneracies inherent in this problem .",
    "* many additional dependencies ( e.g. sampling period , perturber mass , relative mean anomaly , etc , etc ) can significantly alter the expected ttv signal for a particular system .",
    "we defer the provision of a detailed investigation of such matters to a companion paper , _ veras et al .",
    "2010 , in prep .",
    "_ * future work could also investigate in more detail the regions _ above _ the hill stability curve , seeking to identify the ( likely large ) ttvs for any stable systems which exist in that region .",

    "<S> this high inclination decrease in ttv amplitude ( on and away from resonance ) is important for the analysis of the known retrograde and multi - planet transiting systems , as inclination effects need to be considered if ttvs are to be used to exclude the presence of any putative planetary companions : absence of evidence is not evidence of absence . </S>"
