    "fu orionis - type objects ( hereafter , fuors ) are a class of low - mass pre - main sequence objects named after the archetype fu orionis ( hereafter , fu ori ) , which produced a 6 magnitude outburst at @xmath6-band in 1936 and has remained close to peak brightness ever since .",
    "about five more sources have been observed to flare with lightcurves broadly resembling that of fu ori ( 5 mag optical flare over @xmath4 1 yr ) . similar spectral characteristics ( broad blueshifted emission lines , ir excess , near - ir co overtone absorption ) have been used to identify @xmath4 10 additional fuor - like objects @xcite ; a number of additional candidates have been identified ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the star could accrete @xmath4 0.01 m@xmath10 of material , roughly the mass of a typical t tauri disk @xcite .",
    "pre - outburst optical spectra available for two fuors ( v1057 cyg and hbc 722 , below ) are consistent with t tauri stars @xcite ; they now have optical spectral types of f and k supergiants , respectively . this change in spectral type",
    "is attributed to the large increase in continuum emission in the optical / near - ir , typically dominated by the newly heated inner disk annuli rather than the central star , during outburst .    only in recent years , it has become possible to produce full spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of fuors , the closest of which are several times farther away than the best - studied low mass star forming regions , first with the infrared space observatory ( iso , 20 - 200 @xmath0 m ; * ? ? ?",

    "more recently , the spitzer space telescope @xcite and the herschel space observatory @xcite cover an extended spectral range ( 5.3670 @xmath0 m ) with a greater sensitivity due in part to _",

    "_ spitzer_-irs @xcite observations reveal that some fuors resemble embedded protostars , in that their excess emission at wavelengths greater than @xmath4 30 @xmath0 m can not be accounted for by circumstellar disk models alone , while others lack a strong mid - ir excess above that of a mildly flared disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the lone surprise is v1331 cyg which might be expected to be the second - most blue / evolved source , given its silicate emission feature and flat / slightly declining mid - ir sed . in summary",

    "unfortunately , the value of  as an evolutionary proxy is debatable . in the case of an fuor flare ,",
    "models suggest that the far - ir luminosity will increase within a few months of outburst @xcite , although @xcite find , in contrast , that changes to the sed occur primarily in the optical / ir rather than the submillimeter on the 1 - 10 yr timescale .",
    "if the far - ir lagged significantly behind , this would increase  without any change in the submillimeter sed or derived envelope mass .",
    "however , this scenario would require the dust to be 1 - 10 ly ( 0.3 - 3.0 pc ) distant , and hence unrelated to the fuor .",
    "thus we also consider a criteria related to the physical stage of the object , using the herschel spectra .",
    "we calculate the envelope mass using the `` oh5 '' opacity law @xcite as described in e.g. , @xcite .",
    "first we determine an approximate dust temperature from the shape of the pacs and spire continuum from 100 - 600 @xmath0 m . we compare dust at this temperature , assuming an emissivity @xmath22 @xmath39 , normalized to the 350 @xmath0 m continuum , to confirm that the model slope is similar to the observed spectrum .",
    "then we calculate an envelope mass from the spire photometry .",
    "the results for the four isolated sources in our sample are shown in table [ envmass ] . using this criteria , @xcite consider 0.1 @xmath15 as the envelope mass cutoff between stage i and ii sources .",
    "their boundary value was derived from @xcite models , converting their boundary accretion rate value of 10@xmath21 @xmath17 to 0.07 @xmath15 , with the additional consideration that disks greater than 0.1 @xmath15 were gravitationally unstable . however , there are two dominant sources of uncertainty in this calculation",
    ". first , the dust temperature is not perfectly constrained , and varies between 38 and 54 k , causing an uncertainty in the derived envelope mass of @xmath4 35% .",
    "second , the estimated mass increases significantly if derived using longer wavelengths , due to the inclusion of increasingly larger areas of colder dust from the more distant parts of the envelope , suggesting that values calculated at 350 @xmath0 m generally underestimate the envelope mass .    the results for each classification method are summarized in table [ class ] .",
    "the @xmath22 and  classifications agree very well , while the envelope mass method indicates an earlier evolutionary stage than the other methods in the cases of v1057 cyg and v1515 cyg .",
    "if we crudely average the classifications of the three different methods ( assigning values of 1 , 1.5 , and 2 to class / stage i , flat spectrum , and class / stage ii , respectively ) , we find the following sequence in increasing order of class / stage : v1057 cyg ( 1.5 ) , v1515 cyg ( 1.67 ) , v1331 cyg ( 1.67 ) , v1735 cyg ( 1.75 ) , and hbc 722 ( 2.0 ) .",
    "this ordering is broadly in agreement with the mid - ir dust feature sequence from @xcite .",
    "therefore , we find that the umbrella group of `` fuors '' includes both stage i and ii objects",
    ".      we also update  for our sample .",
    "first it is important to consider the observational epochs of the data in our seds : the optical / near - ir data has been updated to match the 2005 - 2006 _ spitzer _ spectra ; the _ herschel _ data are from 2011 .",
    "thus the computed  values are upper limits to the current , if all are declining .",
    "@xcite found that the flux for @xmath25 @xmath19 20 @xmath0 m held constant in time ; thus the seds including the _ herschel _ data may closely represent the sed from the 2005 - 6 timeframe .",
    "however , @xcite find that while the wavelength - dependent variability during outburst is led on day timescales at mid - ir and shorter wavelengths , at wavelengths close to 100 @xmath0 m the effect on the sed occurs over months , and the @xmath25 @xmath8 200 @xmath0 m _ herschel _ spectra could be sensitive to changes .",
    "the addition of the herschel data affects the derived  and  systematically , but this is overshadowed by a larger effect attributable to beamsize .",
    "first , we compare the seds with and without the _ herschel _ data : including pacs / spire data along with ancillary photometry results in larger , and smaller , by 10 - 20% for each source , compared to the values derived only from the ancillary photometry .",
    "the reason for this systematic increase in  is that the broad extrapolation from spitzer ( 35 @xmath0 m ) data to the 850 @xmath0 m or 1.1 mm data , in the absence of the _ herschel _ data , slightly understates the total flux .",
    "however , the beamsize of far - ir ( iras ) data used in older calculations of  likely caused significant overestimation of the bolometric luminosity . comparing our measurements to earlier values of",
    ", v1057 cyg peaked at 800  at peak and dropped to 250  @xcite , but we calculate an  of 119 .",
    "the large beamsize of the far - ir data used in the @xcite estimate causes a significant overestimate : we calculated  for v1057 cyg using only the optical / near - ir and iras fluxes from @xcite and found an  of 215 , comparable to their derived value of 250 .",
    "this is much greater than the 119  we calculate using the _ herschel _ fluxes ; thus we conclude that the discrepancy is due to the greater fluxes at 25 and 60",
    "@xmath0 m from iras compared with pacs . in the case of fu ori ,",
    "we observed a similar but smaller effect ; although the iras fluxes are a factor of 2 - 3 higher than the pacs fluxes ,  only changes from 274 to 210  with the updated data .",
    "fu ori is a much bluer object than v1057 cyg , and thus its  is less sensitive to changes in submillmeter flux . whether this is a beamsize effect or an actual decrease in luminosity is not clear , in either source .    with these caveats in mind",

    "furthermore , the sources in @xcite typically show crystalline silicate dust in the irs bands , whereas all of the fuor irs spectra are pristine @xcite . at this time , calibration uncertainties in spectral shape prevent a search for 60 - 70 @xmath0 m h@xmath3o crystalline ice features .",

    "in fact , the self - absorption dip is the clearest indicator of the source velocity , and the hco@xmath34 peak is slightly redshifted in comparison to the absorption , indicating that some of the contributing gas in the red part of the wings is at the source velocity ; the wings are typical of embedded sources ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the sources with stronger high-@xmath41 co also exhibit broader co profiles ; the hco@xmath34 is always a narrow single peak in all sources . in v1735 cyg and hbc 722 ,",
    "the broad co traces contaminating outflows , while the hco@xmath34 measures the velocity of the ambient dense gas . to the extent that hco@xmath34 aligns with the absorption in co",
    ", we presume that low excitiation ambient gas is present at that velocity .    in the case of v1515 cyg , we see little excited gas , consistent with earlier observations @xcite . in the cases of fu ori and v1331 cyg",
    ", we interpret the weak , single - peaked co as tracing the source . in the case of v1057 cyg",
    ", we observe a narrower but still somewhat broad feature .",
    "v1057 cyg also has the richest pacs spectrum ; in this case the co emission may originate from material at the source , rather than contaminating outflows . in this case",
    ", the outflow and the high-@xmath41 co may be driven from v1057 cyg itself .",
    "thus the mid - ir non-_herschel _ seds are not good predictors of which emission lines would be detected at longer wavelengths . despite similar mid - ir spectral features , shape , and extinction parameters , v1515 cyg and v1057 cyg are quite different from the _ herschel _ perspective .",
    "we might posit that co emission from hot gas would be a transitory signature of heating from a recent outburst .",
    "how then do we explain the lack of high-@xmath41 co emission in these fuors ?",
    "analysis of the _ non - detections _ reveals that the absence of high-@xmath41 co and all but one h@xmath3o line in our sources is of only modest significance .",
    "figure [ gas ] shows histograms of the line luminosities of the co ( left ) and h@xmath3o 174.63 @xmath0 m ( right ) for the digit sample @xcite .",
    "the vertical dashed lines show the strength of these lines in v1057 cyg ; the vertical dotted lines show 3@xmath36 upper limits for the non - detections in the foosh sample . in both cases ,",
    "the detected co line ( in v1057 cyg ) would be among the brightest in the digit protostar sample , but not a notable outlier .",
    "the upper limits from our sample for co and h@xmath3o are not low enough to rule out significant emission in any source .",
    "if the co emission originates in a tenuous envelope , there may not be enough emitting material to produce a detectable signature in the warmer regions .",
    "if the co emission originates in a disk , then we require a thermal inversion to produce emission lines in the upper layer .",
    "models suggest that the midplane of fuors may become hotter than the upper disk layers during outburst , which would mask the signature of co @xcite .",
    "our data do not sufficiently constrain the line luminosities to distinguish the fuors from ordinary protostars .    in the digit sample ,",
    "the co emission from disks is much weaker .",
    "the highest line luminosity from co detected in the digit disks sample is in hd 100546 , a herbig ae / be star of similar luminosity to the fuors @xcite .",
    "the co line is a factor of 20 weaker in luminosity than v1057 cyg , at 3@xmath2910@xmath49  ( meeus et al .",
    ", subm . ) .",
    "thus it is unlikely that the disk is a significant contributor to the co line luminosity in v1057 cyg .",
    "we consider here a few other marginal detections .",
    "we report the detection of a single line of h@xmath3o at 174.63 @xmath0 m in v1057 cyg .",
    "the h@xmath3o line luminosity in v1057 cyg is 0.47 @xmath29 10@xmath43 @xmath23 , which would place this single line among the most luminous of the digit sample .",
    "the 174.63 @xmath0 m line ( excitation energy of 197 k ) is not even the lowest excitation line within the pacs bands ; in embedded sources the lowest energy detected h@xmath3o line is at 179.53 @xmath0 m ( 114 k ) ; however the 174.63 @xmath0 m line is typically among the most luminous h@xmath3o lines detected in class 0/i protostars .",
    "we also do not detect the 557 ghz @xmath57 line in the spire bands .",
    "we do not detect h@xmath3o in any other sources .",
    "although the detection in v1057 cyg is robust , the upper limits on this line in the other fuors do not rule out substantial emission lines as well .",
    "we tentatively detect oh 84.41 @xmath0 m , half of a doublet in the 3/2 @xmath40 3/2 ladder , also in v1057 cyg . although this is the most commonly detected line in the embedded sample , the 84.61 @xmath0 m half of the doublet is typically just as strong .",
    "more prominently , oh 119 @xmath0 m is seen _ in absorption _ in v1735 cyg .",
    "only v1735 cyg and 2 of 30 class 0/i sources in the digit sample show this line in absorption .",
    "there is also a hint of oh emission at 163 @xmath0 m , possibly blended with a weak detection of the co line , but both detections are inconclusive .",
    "no other molecules are detected in the foosh sample with _",
    "herschel_. in contrast ,",
    "at least some embedded sources show rich spire spectra ( @xcite , green et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    "however , the upper limits for h@xmath3o and oh line luminosity are consistent with the detections in embedded sources .",
    "157.74 @xmath0 m is detected in v1735 cyg , v1331 cyg , and v1515 cyg , but is not clearly associated with the sources , similar to the digit embedded sources .",
    "is observed at 370 and 610 @xmath0 m in all sources .",
    "the  370/610 @xmath0 m flux ratio falls between 2.1 and 3.0 across the sample , consistent with ism values @xcite , and the  emission is associated with cooler extended gas rather than the fuors themselves .",
    "the spire maps show that the lines are extended ( at beamsize @xmath4 40@xmath20 ) ; we do not attribute the emission to the fuors .",
    "205 @xmath0 m ( spire ) is observed to emit strongly in hbc 722 , v1331 cyg , v1057 cyg , and v1515 cyg , but not v1735 cyg or fu ori .",
    "the  122 @xmath0 m ( pacs ) line is detected along with the 205 @xmath0 m line around v1515 cyg ; no other sources in our sample show the 122 @xmath0 m line .",
    "this is in contrast with iso - lws results , in which  was marginally detected at 122 @xmath0 m with iso - lws in v1735 cyg , v1331 cyg , v1057 cyg @xcite . as noted earlier , the difference in detection rates of  122 @xmath0 m is likely due to the use of an off - position for our pacs data , but an onboard calibration source for spire .",
    "we detected both lines around v1515 cyg , and examined the pacs and spire maps to see if there was any hint of centrally peaked emission .",
    "the flux of each line shows no significant variation ( @xmath38 50% ) across the entire pacs and spire field - of - view , and is uncorrelated with proximity to the central position .",
    "the  122/205 @xmath0 m flux ratio is diagnostic of the electron density @xcite ; the ratio in the central pixel is 0.31 , suggesting an extremely low electron density ( n@xmath58 @xmath38 1 cm@xmath43 .",
    "we note that the observed ratio should be considered an upper limit , as the pacs spectra are observed using an off - position for sky subtraction , while the spire spectra are not .",
    "further evidence of the diffuse nature of the  emission comes from the fact that there is no clear trend between   205 @xmath0 m and the strength or position of the co emission .",
    "thus we conclude that among fine structure lines , only the  emission is localized to the fuor .",
    "it has been posited from occurrence rate @xcite and from simulation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that fuors are stage 0/i stars undergoing episodic outburst cycles with replenished material from an infalling envelope .",
    "however , fuors have much in common with class ii sources : in spitzer - irs bands all but v1735 cyg show silicate emission and optical - ir continuum indices consistent with relatively low extinction ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it has been suggested that the overall group of fuors fall into two different categories , those consistent with flared disks , and those requiring envelopes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite modeled the dust from spitzer - irs observations of fu ori , v1057 cyg , and v1515 cyg and found that v1057 cyg and v1515 cyg required envelopes typical of protostars , while fu ori did not require an envelope .",
    "herschel _ spectra generally fall above their model predictions , indicating an underestimate of the reservoir of cold dust surrounding these systems . nonetheless , our estimates of the envelope mass from the _ herschel _ dust emission broadly agrees with this classification ; we find that v1057 cyg and v1515 cyg have envelopes greater than 0.1 @xmath15 , while fu ori has a much smaller envelope mass of @xmath4 0.02 @xmath15 .",
    "hbc 722 was considered a t tauri star prior to outburst , and measurements of the envelope mass upper limit suggest a tenuous envelope at best .",
    "we noted some inconsistencies between the different classification methods for the continuum , but found broad agreement with the mid - ir sequence in @xcite .",
    "however , fuors may not be well - characterized by the stage i / ii sequence , because the _ herschel _ line observations provide a different picture from the continuum . in general , the presence of weaker silicate features and larger mid - ir @xmath22 is correlated with increased submillimeter dust and co / h@xmath3o emission , but is not well - correlated with .",
    "class 0/i sources typically exhibit hotter and more excited co rotational lines than class ii sources ( cf .",
    "@xcite , meeus et al . subm . ) ; by this standard fuors would _ seem _ to resemble disk sources ; however , these lines may be too faint to detect in our observations .",
    "the digit ( and hops ) samples show a tight correlation between co line luminosity and derived ( warm ) . in v1057 cyg ,",
    "the only fuor where the warm gas is detected , it falls in the digit embedded source correlation .",
    "additionally the digit sample showed a lack of correlation between ( warm ) and ( co ) ; again , the lone fuor ( v1057 cyg ) is consistent with the embedded sample .",
    "finally , the digit sample showed a ( weaker ) trend between  and ( warm ) ; once again v1057 cyg fits this trend .",
    "it is clear that the spectra of v1057 cyg , as characterized by pacs , would not distinguish it as an outlier in the digit class 0/i sample , even though it has a class ii sed , suggesting it is a kind of hybrid object .",
    "however , the high upper limits on line emission do not provide strong constraints on the evolutionary state of the other fuors .",
    "we present analysis of six fuors with _",
    "herschel_-pacs , spire , and hifi , _ spitzer_-irs , and cso heterodyne observations , from the `` foosh '' sample .",
    "* we present pacs and spire imaging of v1057 cyg , v1331 cyg , v1515 cyg , v1735 cyg , and fu ori , and their surrounding regions .",

    "the optical fuor is only marginally detected at spire wavelengths .",
    "most fall in complicated far - ir fields , typical of active star - forming regions , but only two ( v1735 cyg and hbc 722 ) are confused .",
    "v1735 cyg is blended with v1735 cyg sm1 , a nearby submillimeter source , at wavelengths greater than 100 @xmath0 m , and hbc 722 , as noted previously , is blended with 2mass 20581767 + 4353310 at wavelengths",
    "greater than 70 @xmath0 m . * the 1 - 1000 @xmath0 m seds for the five older fuors indicate that fu ori , v1515 cyg , and v1057 cyg are class ii , while v1735 cyg and v1331 cyg are borderline class i / ii , or flat spectrum sources , classified by .",
    "we derive envelope masses of 0.07 - 0.3 @xmath15 from the long wavelength data , and find fu ori and v1331 cyg to be stage ii , v1515 cyg to be borderline stage i / ii , and v1057 cyg to be stage i by the @xcite criterion ( envelope mass @xmath19 0.1 ) .",
    "their derived  values are somewhat lower than previously measured values , likely a complication of the replacement of the large iras beamsize with the smaller pacs / spire beam in our seds . *",

    "122 and 205 @xmath0 m and  158 @xmath0 m are detected as well ; the latter two lines are detected in four of the sources while the former is only detected in one of those ( v1515 cyg ) .",

    "hbc 722 is detected only weakly in continuum at 70 @xmath0 m , and cleanly detected in line emission only in  63 @xmath0 m .",
    "* analysis of v1735 cyg is complicated by the presence of a nearby submillimeter source ( v1735 cyg sm1 ) , and the contributions from the two sources to gas lines other than  can not be separated .",
    "this includes four mid-@xmath41 transitions of @xmath1co as well as nine transitions of co. mapping indicates that the detected co emission is dominated by sm1 .",
    "the low - lying oh 119 @xmath0 m doublet is observed in absorption toward v1735 cyg ; by comparison , this is seen in 2 of 30 protostars in the digit sample .",

    "* v1057 cyg is an outlier among the foosh sample .",
    "we detect co up to and determine that the emitting source is compact .",
    "we fit cool ( 81 k ) and warm ( 368 k ) rotational temperature components to the co. we detect h@xmath3o in one transition at 174.63 @xmath0 m , which would place this source among the most luminous protostars in line emission in the digit sample , but not an extreme outlier .",
    "v1057 cyg also shows a tentative detection of oh 84.41 @xmath0 m . * in the other three sources ( v1331 cyg , v1515 cyg , and fu ori ) , no h@xmath3o or oh lines are detected , but upper limits are still consistent with the detections for protostars .",

    "we fit cool components of 30 and 19 k to v1331 cyg and v1515 cyg , respectively ; no component can be fit for fu ori , which is detected in only a single co transition ( ) .",
    "although v1057 cyg and v1515 cyg are very similar from the _ spitzer _ perspective ( in terms of their sed , extinction values , and dust properties ) , they are differentiated by their gas properties in the _ herschel _ range : the former exhibits high - j co , h@xmath3o and luminous ; the latter shows no molecular emission and only weak  traceable to the source . *",
    "dense gas is present at the source velocity in all four sources where it was observed , based on hco@xmath34 . in one case ,",
