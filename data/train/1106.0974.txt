    "the qcd phase transition is one of the important ingredients in understanding the evolution of the early universe .",
    "monte - carlo simulation of lattice qcd is the most powerful approach to study the nature of the qcd phase transition at present @xcite .",
    "it is known that the order of the phase transition depends on the values of quark masses : the deconfinement phase transition is of first order when masses of all three ( up , down and strange ) quarks are either sufficiently large or small , while it turns into a crossover in the intermediate region @xcite .",
    "previous studies with staggered quarks strongly suggest that the transition becomes a crossover at physical quark masses @xcite .",
    "a confirmation of this result by other fermion formulations such as wilson - type fermions or by other methods of analyses is , however , mandatory to draw a definite conclusion on the nature of the transition at physical quark masses @xcite .    among several methods to study the nature of phase transitions , a probability distribution of physical observables provides us with the most intuitive way to determine the order of the phase transition . adopting an appropriate physical quantity such as a quark number , chiral order parameter , gauge action etc .",
    ", the corresponding probability distribution function is constructed by measuring a generation rate of configurations at each fixed value of the physical quantity .",
    "then an existence of double or multiple peaks in the probability distribution function give a signal of a first order phase transition , since two phases coexist at a first order phase transition point .    in this study , we investigate the quark mass dependence of the order of the qcd phase transition in the large quark mass region using the hopping parameter expansion .",
    "we expect the first order phase transition in the heavy quark limit becomes a crossover as we decrease the quark masses from infinity .",
    "we take the plaquette , i.e. @xmath4 wilson loop , as the quantity to study the order of the transition .",
    "the reweighting technique @xcite is employed to vary quark masses in the lowest order of the hopping parameter expansion , and we determine an end point where the first order phase transition turns into a crossover .",

    "since the distribution function is doubly peaked at and around a first order transition point , the corresponding effective potential has a double - well structure and the derivative @xmath31 becomes an s - shaped function .",
    "therefore , close to the transition point , @xmath31 must vanish at three points . in general , to find the first order phase transition by observing these properties , a fine tuning of @xmath17 is required . for the case of the plaquette effective potential",
    ", however , we can detect the existence of the first order transition through the appearance of the s - shape in @xmath31 without fine tunings , since the @xmath5-dependence of @xmath32 itself is independent of @xmath17 as shown in eq .",

    "we note that the identification of the order of the phase transition by the @xmath34 is equivalent to that by the fourth order binder cumulant , @xmath41with @xmath42 an appropriate operator signaling the phase transition , since both @xmath34 and @xmath43 detect a change of the distribution function . on the other hand , to correctly evaluate @xmath43 at a first order transition point , we need to know precisely the probability distribution in a wide range of @xmath42 covering both peaks @xcite .",
    "a fine - tuning to the transition point and a high statistics with sufficiently many flip - flops are required for a reliable estimate of @xmath43 at the transition point .",
    "furthermore , to achieve well separated peaks , a large system volume is required .",
