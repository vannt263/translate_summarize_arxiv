    "during the period of inflationary expansion in the very early stages of the universe , primordial perturbations were generated that are the seeds of the structures that we can observe today @xcite .",
    "these primordial perturbations were linearly imprinted in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies .",
    "thus the study of the cmb anisotropies is a powerful way to understand the physics of the early universe .",
    "many observational cmb projects , for example the nasa wmap and esa planck missions , different ground based 3d observational campaigns of large scale structure and high energy accelerators are enabling us to understand better the properties and the evolution of the universe . from the several observational approaches that are available , the search for departures from gaussianity in the cmb anisotropies with a primordial origin has become a powerful way to discriminate among different inflationary scenarios .",
    "inflationary models such as the widely accepted standard , single - field , slow roll inflation predict low levels of non - gaussianity whereas other models predict levels of non - gaussianity that may be detected using the data from current experiments @xcite .",
    "a detection of a deviation from gaussianity with a primordial origin would rule out many inflationary models and would have far reaching implications in the physics of the early universe .    the level of primordial non - gaussianity is usually parametrised by the non - linear coupling parameter @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this parameter measures departures from zero in the values of the third order quantity known as the bispectrum , characterised through the shape function @xmath8 . the bispectrum is related to bardeen s curvature perturbations @xmath9 through the 3-point correlation function @xmath10 .",
    "depending on the physical mechanisms of the different inflationary models the shape function can take different forms .    in this paper",

    "the non - gaussian @xmath27 coefficients can be written in terms of the bispectrum and the gaussian @xmath28 coefficients : @xmath29 using the fact that the shape functions of the local , equilateral and orthogonal bispectra are separable , we are able to reduce the number of sums in eq .",

    "for all the cases , @xmath53 is lower than the value obtained with simulations ( @xmath5495% depending on the shape ) . we think that this small discrepancy is due to the limited number of simulations .",
