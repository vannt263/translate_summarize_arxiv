    "recently , it has been discovered@xcite that high quality two - dimensional electron systems in the quantum hall regime ( strong perpendicular magnetic field , low temperature ) host states with highly anisotropic transport properties .",
    "these occur when the filling factor @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is the electron density , @xmath3 the magnetic length and @xmath4 the magnetic field ) is close to half integer with numerator not too small . the strongest effects seem to occur for @xmath5 , with similar phenomena present at @xmath6 etc . near these filling factors a large asymmetry",
    "is observed in the diagonal components of the resistivity tensor @xmath7 and @xmath8 that sets in below approximately @xmath9mk in gaas systems .",
    "the resistivity ratios @xmath10 may be as large as 3500@xcite , although the effect is exaggerated by system geometry@xcite .",
    "the directions of high / low resistance are clearly correlated with the gaas crystal axes , although the precise mechanism by which they are chosen is at present unknown . for states near @xmath11 ,",
    "_ etc _ , the high / low resistance directions may be rotated by application of an in - plane magnetic field@xcite .",
    "states leading to this anisotropic transport are likely to be related to _ striped _ states that were found in mean - field studies@xcite of systems in which several landau levels are filled , and the highest occupied landau level has a partial filling @xmath12 in the range @xmath13 .",
    "such ordering has been shown to occur in exact diagonalization studies of finite size systems@xcite . in a seminal theoretical work ,",
    "the stability of this state to thermal and quantum fluctuations was investigated by fradkin and kivelson@xcite , who pointed out a powerful analogy between liquid crystals and quantum hall stripes .",
    "the analogy allows a classification of states according to symmetries ; these include stripe crystal , smectic , and nematic phases . as will be shown below , at zero temperature mean - field theory",
    "predicts that the stripe crystal is lowest in energy among these .",
    "however , it has been argued that the smectic state may be stabilized by quantum@xcite or thermal @xcite fluctuations , or both@xcite .",
    "finite temperature studies@xcite of a model representing the nematic phase yield impressive agreement with experiment of the resistance anisotropy at temperatures that are not too low .",
    "effects of in - plane magnetic fields@xcite have been studied and have provided some understanding of the interchange of the high / low resistance directions , although the different experimental behavior for @xmath14 is still unexplained .    beyond transport studies ,",
    "low - dimensional electron systems may be probed by coupling to their collective modes , for example via inelastic light scattering@xcite or surface acoustic waves@xcite .",
    "these collective modes for quantum hall stripes are the subject of this study .",
    "our method will be the time - dependent hartree - fock approximation in the form developed by ct and macdonald @xcite .",
    "the method requires a static hartree - fock groundstate around which we can compute excitations .",
    "the simplest form@xcite for such state is to treat the completely filled @xmath15 landau levels as inert , and form a one dimensional array of alternating filled and empty guiding center states in the partially filled @xmath16_th _ landau level . in this approximation",
    ", the low energy hamiltonian for the partially filled level may be mapped to the lowest landau level , with a modified electron - electron interaction .",
    "this modification is responsible for the low energy of stripe ordering in this system@xcite .",
    "we find , however , that uniform stripe states are unstable within the hartree - fock approximation to formation of modulations along the stripes .",
    "the resulting state is essentially an ordered array of one - dimensional crystals , i.e. , a `` stripe crystal '' @xcite . fig .",
    "1 illustrates the charge density for a stripe crystal phase .",
    "the amplitude of the density modulation along the stripe is small ; nevertheless , the energy gained in going from uniform stripes to the stripe crystal is considerable .",
    "for example , for @xmath17 in the @xmath18 landau level , the striped phase is found to have energy per particle of @xmath19 in units of @xmath20 ( here @xmath21 is the dielectric constant ; this will be our unit of energy throughout this paper ) , while the stripe crystal has energy @xmath22 .",
    "for the parameters of ref .",
    "@xcite , the energy difference between these two states is 112 mk , well above the temperatures for which anisotropic transport is observed .",
    "similar results are found at other values of both @xmath23 and @xmath12 .",
    "the energy lowering in forming modulations along the stripes is largely an intrastripe effect .",
    "for example , one may compute the energy of a stripe crystal with a rectangular unit cell rather than the oblique one illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . the modulations of the stripes in this state are `` in - phase '' , requiring an additional hartree energy . however , due to the weakness of the modulations and the long - range nature of the coulomb interaction , the quantitative value of this energy cost is minuscule , of the order @xmath24 k. thus , the chains may easily slide past one another .",
    "certainly , at any experimentally attainable temperature , the crystal will melt into a series of thermally and quantum disordered one - dimensional crystals@xcite .    in principle , at zero temperature hartree - fock theory predicts the system locks into a stripe crystal .",
    "the collective modes around this state may be characterized by wavevectors @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the wavevector component parallel to the stripes and @xmath27 is the perpendicular component .",
    "the low energy collective modes are phonons , and in principle are gapped everywhere except at @xmath28 . in practice , because of the small energy scale associated with locking , we find nearly gapless modes whenever @xmath29 , independent of @xmath27 ; the gaps are barely resolved by our numerical technique , and are far below currently experimentally attainable temperature scales .",
    "the low energy collective modes are thus highly reminiscent of what is expected for a smectic state@xcite .",
    "2 illustrates the phonon modes for several values of @xmath30 as a function of @xmath31 , computed using the time - dependent hartree - fock approximation ( tdhfa ) as described below .",
    "several important features are worth noting .",
    "\\(1 ) the modes disperse linearly except for @xmath32 , which disperses more slowly .",
    "as shown below , this is consistent with a harmonic theory of a charged smectic system in a magnetic field .",
    "the apparent absence of a gap for @xmath33 arises because in these collective modes the motion of the electrons is parallel to the stripe direction .",
    "( this can be seen from the eigenvector of the phonon mode from which one can compute the motion of the stripes in real space .",
    "see ref.@xcite for details . )",
    "the gap is then controlled by interactions of the modulations in different stripes , which is very weak in this system .",
    "\\(2 ) for larger values of @xmath31 , the modes become independent of @xmath27 .",
    "physically , this arises because the phonon modes are nearly longitudinal for large @xmath31 , involving motion of the stripe modulations but no significant motion of the positions of the stripes relative to one another @xcite .",
    "since the stripe modulations communicate so weakly , the relative phase of motion between stripes has practically no effect on the energy of the mode  hence , no @xmath34 dependence .",
    "\\(3 ) as might be expected , a gap opens up near @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the distance between modulations of a stripe .",
    "this leads to a local maximum in the phonon dispersion . in light of ( 2 )",
    "above , and as may be seen explicitly in fig .",
    "2 , the maximum is extremely flat along the @xmath37 direction . as a result , there is a large phonon density of states ( dos ) at this energy , as illustrated in fig .",
    "other minima and maxima appear in the phonon dispersion which also contribute to structure in the dos , most notably a double peak at approximately half the energy of the @xmath38 peak .",
    "such structures may be observable in inelastic light scattering@xcite , and their detection would yield optical evidence of stripe ordering in this system .",
    "\\(4 ) a very low energy mode appears along the brillouin zone boundary at @xmath39 ( @xmath40 is the separation between the stripes ) near @xmath41 as @xmath42 increases , this mode becomes soft ( vanishing in energy ) just above @xmath43 .",
    "this indicates a second order phase transition and increased structure in the stripe state as one moves sufficiently away from half - filling@xcite .",
    "this may indicate a second order phase transition into a `` bubble phase '' @xcite or some precursor of this phase .",
    "alternatively , it may represent a buckling instability , in which neighboring maxima within a stripe displace perpendicular to the stripe and antiparallel to one another .",
    "( such instabilities are known to occur at wigner crystal edges @xcite . )",
    "the precise motion of the charge in the soft mode is quite complex @xcite .",
    "work is currently underway to determine the precise nature of the groundstate after the instability has occured .",
    "in addition to the low energy phonon modes , the stripe phases support magnetoplasmon modes and spin wave modes , and we have explicitly computed them in tdhfa . fig .",
    "4 illustrates an example of the magnetoplasmon modes appearing as poles of the density response function in the first brillouin zone .",
    "the several apparent branches may be understood when the structure is compared to analogous modes for a liquid state ( no stripes ) of the same partially filled landau level , illustrated by the solid lines in the same figure .",
    "one may see that folding higher order brillouin zones into the first roughly generates the modes captured by the tdhfa .",
    "one may thus treat the effect of stripe ordering on these high energy modes to a first approximation as that of a periodic potential on an electron gas .",
    "a similar effect occurs for the spin - wave modes .",
    "this does _ not _ occur for the phonon modes because no such modes exist in the liquid state .",
    "the presence of several branches of modes near small values of @xmath44 in principle may be detected by optical or surface acoustic wave methods .",
    "such an observation would constitute a relatively direct demonstration of striped ordering since it indicates zone - folding effects associated with a unidirectional periodic modulation .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ hf ] , the hartree - fock method used to generate mean - field states is briefly discussed , and some more details of the results are provided .",
    "section [ tdhfa ] briefly outlines the method used to obtain collective modes , and presents the remainder of our results for collective modes , both in the stripe state and , for comparison , in the liquid state .",
    "we conclude with a summary ( section [ summary ] ) .",

    "analytic expressions for collective modes of liquid states for partially filled landau levels are presented in appendix [ app : liquid ] .",
    "appendix [ harmonic ] describes a simple elastic theory demonstrating that the results of the tdhfa can be described at long wavelengths by a system with smectic order .",
    "in this section we briefly review the hartree - fock approximation ( hfa ) as developed in ref .",
    "@xcite ; some further details are presented in appendix [ app : tdhfa ] .",

    "the hfa to the groundstate expectation values of @xmath52 are non - zero only for @xmath53 on the reciprocal lattice , and are readily obtained from @xcite @xmath54 hartree - fock energies , electron densities and response functions may be computed from @xmath55 .    for filling factors @xmath56 , a further simplification / approximation is to project the hamiltonian into the single @xmath57 landau level , which is formally appropriate when the electron - electron interaction scale @xmath58 is much smaller than the cyclotron energy @xmath59 ( we take @xmath60 throughout this paper ) . while in experimental situations these energy scales are comparable , calculations@xcite retaining several landau levels show that , for magnetic fields and electron densities relevant to ref .",
    "@xcite , landau level mixing lowers the hartree - fock energy by @xmath61 for the striped state .",
    "this is sufficiently small to be neglected for our present study , and we effectively retain only a single landau level in our static hfa calculations . assuming also that there is no spin texture@xcite in the ground - state , and denoting by the index @xmath62 the partially filled landau level , we have for @xmath63    @xmath64    while for @xmath65 @xmath66 we have defined @xmath67 to simplify the notation .    with our approximations , the filled levels are inert and cause only a shift of the ground - state energy . up to an unimportant constant ,",
    "the interaction energy per particle of the hartree - fock state is then @xmath68 \\left| \\left\\langle \\rho _ { p}^{\\alpha } \\left ( { \\bf g}\\right ) \\right\\rangle \\right| ^{2 } ,   \\label{hfen}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 @xmath70 and @xmath71 if @xmath63 ( @xmath72 ) , and @xmath73 ^{2 } , \\\\ x_{pp}\\left ( { \\bf g}\\right ) & = & \\left ( \\frac{e^{2}}{\\kappa \\ell } \\right )   \\sqrt{2}\\int_{0}^{\\infty } dx\\,e^{-x^{2}}\\left [ l_{p}^{0}\\left ( x^{2}\\right ) % \\right ] ^{2}j_{0}\\left ( \\sqrt{2}xg\\ell \\right ) ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath74 the bessel function of order zero and @xmath75 the fourier transform of the electron - electron interaction , for which we use the unscreened coulomb form .",
    "the functions @xmath76 are generalized laguerre polynomials .    to solve the hartree - fock equations ,",
    "some guess is necessary for the crystal structure of the groundstate to specify the set @xmath51 .",
    "the simplest structure for the stripes is a one - dimensional array with lattice constant @xmath40 .",
    "writing @xmath77 , for @xmath69 such states are characterized by order parameters @xmath78 \\theta \\left [ ( n+% \\widetilde{\\nu } /2)a - x\\right ] \\delta _ { x , x^{\\prime } } .",

    "one can also compute a `` density '' profile corresponding to the guiding centers instead of the real density by using @xmath81    such states have been studied for a number of purposes@xcite and provide a good first approximation to the hartree - fock groundstate at the filling factors of interest .",
    "however , within the hfa , this state is not stable and can not be used as a starting point for collective mode calculations : the resulting response functions are unphysical . that this uniform stripe state is not a minimum of the energy within the space of single slater determinants",
    "may be understood as follows .",
    "the interaction energy ( eq . ( [ hfen ] ) ) for uniform stripes may be written as @xmath82 , where @xmath83 are the eigenvalues of the hartree - fock hamiltonian , and the prime indicates a sum over the @xmath84 lowest states , @xmath84 being the number of particles in the partially filled level . the single - particle spectrum @xmath83 has a well - defined fermi energy @xmath85 with eigenvalues arbitrarily close to it . by introducing a one - dimensional modulation _",
    "along _ the stripes , a gap is opened at the fermi energy , the eigenvalues @xmath83 below @xmath85 are pushed down , and the total energy is lowered .",
    "the resulting state is an array of one - dimensional crystals ; i.e. , a stripe crystal .",
    "the collective modes presented below are all for such stripe crystal states .",
    "we conclude this section with some remarks about the results of the hfa .",
    "an example of the density modulation @xmath86 in a stripe crystal state is presented in fig .",
    "1 . results for other landau level indices @xmath87 and partial fillings @xmath88 are qualitatively similar to this .",
    "two points are worth mentioning .",
    "( 1 ) the amplitude of the density modulations in real space are relatively weak , across the stripes and even more so along them .",
    "nevertheless , we will see in the collective mode spectra clear signatures of both periodicities .",
    "it is interesting to note that the weakness of the intrastripe modulations is due mostly to the form factors of the @xmath89 landau level ; if one views the `` guiding center density '' as defined in eq .",
    "( [ guidingc ] ) the intrastripe modulations are quite pronounced ( cf .",
    "( 2 ) the stripe crystal states studied here break particle - hole symmetry ; there are separate electron and hole stripe crystal solutions to the hfa which at @xmath90 are degenerate . for @xmath91 , the electron ( hole )",
    "crystal is lower in energy .",
    "to obtain the dispersion relation of the collective excitations we compute the matrix of response functions @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 is a vector in the first brillouin zone of the lattice .",
    "the collective excitations appear as poles of the dynamical response functions and their dispersion relation is obtained by tracking these poles for several values of @xmath95 in the first brillouin zone . since the order parameters of eq .",
    "( [ approx1 ] ) were obtained in the hartree - fock approximation , a conserving approximation for the response functions is obtained in the time - dependent hartree - fock approximation ( tdhfa ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the equation of motion of this matrix of response functions , in the tdhfa , can be written schematically as @xmath96 \\chi = b$ ] where @xmath97 and @xmath4 are matrices that depend on matrix elements of the direct and exchange interactions and on the order parameters @xmath98 only .",
    "all response functions can then be obtained by solving numerically an eigenvalue equation . in the simplest case ( for the intra - landau level excitation , for example ) , @xmath99 consists of only one response function and accurate results are easy to obtain . in other cases such as for the magnetoplasmon excitations , response functions involving transitions to different landau levels are coupled and the matrix @xmath99 becomes rapidly very large .",
    "our method is thus limited by the size of the matrices @xmath99 that we can handled numerically .",
    "details of the calculation are given in appendix [ app : tdhfa ] ; here we present only the results .",
    "for concreteness , we focus on a partially filled landau level of index @xmath18 and spin @xmath100 , with @xmath101 results for other partial fillings , landau level indices , and spins are qualitatively similar .    to limit the size of the matrix @xmath99 we study the collective excitations with @xmath102 around @xmath103 with @xmath104 or @xmath105 .",
    "we assume that @xmath59 is sufficiently large that coupling among excitations near @xmath106 and @xmath107 may be ignored if @xmath108 . for comparison ,",
    "we compute the same dispersion relations ( when they exist ) in the liquid phase @xmath109 in a homogeneous phase with the same filling factor .",
    "the dispersions in that case are simply obtained by replacing eq.([approx1 ] ) with @xmath110 and setting all other order parameters to zero@xcite .",
    "many , but not all , of the results we find may be understood in terms liquid - like collective modes , whose features have been folded into the first brillouin zone by the periodicity of the striped state .",
    "there are five types of modes that we consider : ( a ) @xmath111 : the phonon mode ( present in the stripe crystal phase only ) appears as a pole of @xmath112 while the spin - wave mode @xmath113 is a pole of @xmath114 , which , according to larmor s theorem , should have @xmath115 ( b ) @xmath116 : there are three magnetoplasmon modes in @xmath117 that also appear in @xmath118 but with different weight .",
    "these three magnetoplasmon modes originate from the fact that there are three possible transitions with pole around @xmath59 , @xmath109 @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "the coulomb interaction mixes these three modes , with the resulting dispersion branches being quite complex even in the liquid phase .",
    "a spin - flip mode with @xmath121 appears as a pole of @xmath122 .",
    "the only possible transition is @xmath123 and there is correspondingly only a single branch in the dispersion .",
    "we will refer to this mode as the @xmath124 mode .",
    "finally , a pair of spin - flip modes with @xmath125 appear as poles of @xmath126 .",
    "these descend from transitions of the form @xmath127",
    ". we will refer to these two modes as the @xmath128 modes .",
    "5 and 6 show the dispersion relation of the five modes for filling factor @xmath129 in the @xmath18 landau level , in the liquid phase .",
    "the complex dispersion relations are due in part to the generalized laguerre polynomial entering in the matrix elements of the hartree - fock interaction which is responsible for the three minima appearing in all these curves . in these figures",
    "( and all others that follow ) , we have substracted the constant term @xmath103 .",
    "note that two of the magnetoplasmon modes disperses from @xmath59 ( as expected from kohn s theorem ) while the third one is gapped .",
    "the higher energy mode that disperses very rapidly is stronger in the density response function @xmath130 while the lowest - energy mode is stronger in @xmath131 .",
    "the middle mode becomes very weak in both response functions as @xmath132 .",
    "> from fig .",
    "6 , we see that the spin wave mode disperses from @xmath133 as expected from larmor s theorem .",
    "the inter - landau - level excitations @xmath124 and @xmath134 however , have their gaps @xmath135 and @xmath136 strongly renormalized by the self - energy and vertex corrections .      for the stripe phase",
    ", we consider the configuration of fig . 1 where the electrons on one stripe are displaced with respect to the electrons on the other stripes .",
    "this stripe crystal can be described by an oblique unit cell with one electron or alternatively by a rectangular unit cell with two electrons . in the inset of fig .",
    "2 , we show the brillouin zone of the oblique unit cell that extend to @xmath137 and to @xmath138 .    unlike the homogeneous liquid phase , the stripe crystal phase can sustain a phonon mode",
    ". the dispersion relation of this mode is presented in fig .",
    "2 . as discussed in the introduction , the most striking feature of the result is the line of nearly gapless modes along @xmath32 .",
    "generically , for a crystal one expects phonon modes to be gapped everywhere except at @xmath139 .",
    "a careful examination of the small @xmath140 limit is consistent with this , although a precise determination of the gap is difficult because the mode weights become very small in this limit .",
    "we estimate the gaps along the @xmath140 line to be in the range @xmath141 , which is far smaller than any experimentally accessible temperature .",
    "physically , this indicates the stripes are free to slide past one another due to thermal fluctuations .    in the inset of fig .",
    "2 , we show the dispersion relation along @xmath140 for several values of @xmath34 .",
    "one sees that the phonons disperse linearly except for @xmath142 where they disperse more slowly . in appendix c , we show that this is consistent with a harmonic theory of a charged smectic system in a magnetic field .",
    "another point worth mentioning is that for larger values of @xmath31 the dispersion in @xmath30 becomes almost independent of @xmath34 . by direct examination of the charge motion in several such collective modes ,",
    "we have found that this arises because the phonon modes are nearly longitudinal for large @xmath26 ; they do not involve significant motion of the positions of the stripes relative to one another .",
    "since the stripe modulations communicate so weakly , the relative phase of motion between stripes has practically no effect on the energy of the mode . as discussed in the introduction ,",
    "this results in resonances in the collective mode density of states that might be observed in inelastic light scattering .",
    "a particularly strong such resonance occurs due to the additional flatness of the dispersion near the brillouin zone boundary along the direction of the stripes ( see fig .",
    "2 ) where a gap opens up separating the `` acoustic '' from the `` optical '' modes .    finally ,",
    "as discussed in the introduction , a soft mode appears that indicates an instability of the modulated stripe state studied here for @xmath143 just below @xmath144 , suggesting at these lower fillings that the correct groundstate will have more structure .",
    "we note that this instability indicates a second - order transition , in contrast to the first - order transition found near @xmath145 between stripe and `` bubble '' states studied in ref .",
    "the result may indicate that a precursor of the bubble phase develops within the stripe phase , perhaps in which the bubbles are elongated rather than circular .",
    "it is also possible that the stripes have a buckling instability in analogy with similar behavior previously noted for wigner crystal edges@xcite .      unlike the phonon mode",
    ", the four other excitations that we consider also exist in the liquid phase .",
    "to understand the effect of the stripes , we plot the dispersion relations obtained in the stripes and liquid phases together .",
    "a few comments on these results are in order before we present them .",
    "for the liquid , we fold the modes in the first brillouin zone of the stripe crystal and keep the lowest - energy branches @xmath146 . along the direction perpendicular to the stripes ,",
    "the lowest - energy branches correspond mostly to the functions @xmath147 with @xmath148 in the direction of the stripes , they correspond mostly to the curves @xmath149 in this case , however , the curves with @xmath150 have the same energies in the liquid ; i.e. , are degenerate .",
    "( the thick lines in the figures represent @xmath111 which is not degenerate ) .",
    "this degeneracy is sometimes lifted in the stripe phase .",
    "note that this brillouin zone folding of the liquid dispersions introduces a large number of branches .",
    "it is not possible to track all the corresponding poles in the stripe phase .",
    "we thus sometimes show only a small subset of these modes corresponding to low - energy excitations . because we keep only the most intense poles and because the relative intensity changes as @xmath151 spans the brillouin zone , the dispersions sometimes appear discontinuous for the stripe phase ; this is because the mode weights fall below our threshold for plotting them .",
    "note that the zone - folding effects lead to the presence of several branches near small values of @xmath152 in principle , these excitations could be detected by optical or surface acoustic wave methods and would thus represent a direct demonstration of the stripe ordering .      for gaas systems , under most circumstances @xmath153 , so that spin waves are the lowest energy modes after the phonons . figs . 7 and 8",
    "show the dispersion relation obtained for the spin waves .",
    "the most striking difference between the zone - folded liquid results and the spin waves of the stripe state is a dramatic anisotropy in the gap opening at the brillouin zone boundary .",
    "this gap is much larger at the boundary for large @xmath27 than the corresponding one for large @xmath31 .",
    "certainly , part of the explanation is that the density modulations responsible for the latter is much smaller than that of the former .",
    "however , the gap at large @xmath30 is much larger than , for example , the corresponding gap in the magnetoplasmons , discussed below .",
    "this strong many - body effect may be related to electrons at the stripe edges having a small local spin stiffness relative to those in the liquid state or in the center of the stripes . in any case , this many - body effect results in a branch of spin waves with surprisingly low energy .      figs .",
    "4 and 9 show the dispersion relation obtained in the stripe phase for the magnetoplasmon modes . to capture all the three branches , we show poles obtained from both the density and spin response functions @xmath117 and @xmath154 . because the three corresponding branches in the liquid are almost flat at large wave vector , the folding of the modes in the first brillouin zone introduces many branches at small energy .",
    "it is quite clear , however , that the dispersion obtained in the stripe phase follows closely that of the liquid , with small gaps at the brillouin zone edges and some lifting of degeneracy in the @xmath31 direction .      some of the spin flip excitations seem to follow behavior reminiscent of our results for the magnetoplasmons , closely following the liquid results , whereas others undergo strong many - body renormalizations , as we found for spin waves .",
    "10 shows the dispersion for the @xmath128 mode .",
    "( in these figures , we show only the low - energy excitations because the liquid modes become very complicated at higher energies . )",
    "one can see the direct correpondance between the liquid phase dispersions and those of the stripe states . as for the magnetoplasmons ,",
    "these differ by gap openings and the lifting of degeneracies . for the @xmath124 mode , as for the spin wave mode ,",
    "the dispersion relation of the lowest - energy branches are quite close to the corresponding liquid result . for higher branches , however , the stripes ordering lead to important changes as can be seen in fig . 11 .",
    "the difference between the behaviors of @xmath124 and @xmath128 is very likely related to the presence of two branches of the former in the liquid state which may be mixed by the stripe ordering , whereas only a single branch exists in the latter .",
    "in this work we have studied collective mode of stripe states for quantum hall systems .",
