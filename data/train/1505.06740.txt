    "nonlocality is a property of correlations that go beyond the paradigm of local realism  @xcite . according to the celebrated theorem of j.  s.  bell",
    ", correlations between the results of measurements of local observables on some quantum states might be nonlocal , i.e. they do not admit a _ local hidden variables _ ( lhv ) model  la einstein - podolski - rosen ( epr )  @xcite . in such instances we talk about bell nonlocality .",
    "operationally , such correlations can not be simulated by correlated classical random variables .",
    "this can be detected by means of the so - called bell inequalities @xcite - the celebrated example of such is the famous clauser - horne - shimony - holt inequality ( chsh )  @xcite .",
    "bell nonlocality is interesting for at least three reasons :    * it is a resource for certain information  processing tasks , such as secure key distribution  @xcite or certified quantum randomness generation  @xcite .",
    "hence , revealing the nonlocality of a given composite quantum state is one of the central problems of quantum information theory , of relevance for future quantum technologies . *",
    "it lies at the heart of fundamental aspects of quantum physics  @xcite , e.g. , playing a fundamental role in our understanding of intrinsic quantum randomness , and sometimes even in philosophical contexts such as the _ free will problem _ @xcite .",
    "* it is extremely challenging mathematically : characterization of non - locality is a complex and difficult problem .",
    "in fact it was proven that determining whether a given set of correlations belongs or not to the set of local epr correlations , is np - complete , whereas specifying all bell inequalities for growing number of involved parties , and/or measured observables , and/or outcomes of measurements is np - hard ( @xcite ; see also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "quantum states that violate a bell inequality are necessarily entangled , or in other words , they are not separable and can not be represented as mixtures of projections onto product states @xcite ( for a review on entanglement see @xcite ) ; the opposite is not necessarily true . already in 1991",
    "gisin proved @xcite that any entangled pure state of two parties violates a bell inequality ( in fact , they violate the chsh inequality ) .",
    "this result was extended to pure entangled states of an arbitrary number of parties by popescu and rohrlich @xcite",
    ". however , the situation changes completely when moving to mixed states : in his seminal paper from 1989 @xcite werner constructed examples of mixed bipartite states that admit a lhv model for all local projective measurements , and nevertheless are entangled .",
    "this result was then generalized by barrett to arbitrary measurements @xcite .",
    "very recently , some of us have shown that entanglement and nonlocality are inequivalent for any number of parties , i.e. that there exist genuinely multipartite entangled states that do not display genuinely multipartite nonlocality @xcite .",
    "it is then clear that entanglement is a weaker property of quantum states than nonlocality .    over the last decade",
    ", entanglement has proven to be very useful to characterize properties of many - body systems and the nature of quantum phase transitions ( qpt ) @xcite .",
    "let us illustrate this statement for lattice spins models described by local hamiltonians , that is , those involving finite range interactions , or interactions rapidly decaying with distance .",
    "most of the results listed below also hold for lattice bose and fermi models , and even for quantum field theories .",
    "in particular , in the ground states ( gs ) ( low energy states ) of such models the following properties are true ( for general reviews see refs .",
    "@xcite ) :    * if one calculates the reduced density matrix for two spins , this density matrix typically exhibits entanglement for short separations of the spins only .",
    "this occurs even at criticality ; still entanglement measures show signatures of qpts @xcite ; * if , instead of calculating a reduced density matrix , one tries to perform optimized measurements on the rest of the system , one concentrates then entanglement in the chosen two spins .",
    "one obtains in this way _ localizable entanglement _",
    "@xcite ; the corresponding entanglement length diverges when the standard correlation length diverges , i.e. , at standard qpts .",
    "interestingly , there exist critical systems for which the correlation length remains finite , while the entanglement localization length goes to infinity @xcite ; * for non - critical systems , gss and low energy states exhibit the , so - called , area laws : the von neuman ( or rnyi ) entropy of the reduced density matrix of a block of size @xmath0 scales as the size of the boundary of the block , @xmath1 ; at criticality a logarithmic divergence occurs frequently @xcite ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "these results are very well established in 1d , while there are plenty of open questions in 2d and higher dimensions ; * gss and low energy states away from criticality can be efficiently described by the , so - called , matrix product states , or more generally tensor network states ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) ; even at criticality mps are efficient in 1d .",
    "* topological order ( at least for gapped systems in 1d and 2d ) exhibits itself frequently in the properties of the , so - called , _ entanglement spectrum _ , i.e. , the spectrum of the logarithm of the reduced density matrix of a block @xmath0 @xcite , and in 2d in the appearance of the , so - called , _ topological entropy _ ,",
    "i.e. , a negative constant correction to the area laws @xcite .    a natural question thus arises : _ does nonlocality also play an important role in characterizing correlations in many - body systems ? _ apart from its fundamental interest , so far the role of nonlocality in such systems has hardly been explored ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "entanglement and nonlocality are known to be inequivalent quantum resources . in principle , a generic many - body state , say a ground state of a local hamiltonian , is pure , entangled and , because all pure entangled states violate a bell inequality  @xcite , it is also nonlocal .",
    "however , this result can not be easily verified in experiments , because the known bell inequalities ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) usually involve products of observables of all observers ( also referred to as parties ) .",
    "unfortunately , measurements of such observables , although in principle possible @xcite , are technically extremely difficult ; instead one has typically `` easy '' access to few - body correlations , say one- and two - body , in generic many - body systems .",
    "thus , the physically relevant question concerning the nonlocality of many - body quantum states is whether its detection is possible using only two - body correlations .    when tackling this problem one has to face the following technical challenges .",
    "first of all , finding bell inequalities that are valid for an arbitrary number of parties is usually a difficult task , as the complexity of characterizing the set of classical correlations scales doubly exponentially with the number of parties .",
    "then , it is natural to expect that bell inequalities based on only few - body correlations are , in general , weaker in revealing nonlocality than those constructed from high - order correlations ( that is , correlations among many of the observers ) . whereas bell inequalities involving correlations among all but one parties have been constructed in @xcite , thus proving that all  partite correlations are not necessary to reveal nonlocality , here we have to consider the more demanding question of whether nonlocality detection is possible for systems of an arbitrary number of parties from the minimal information achievable in a bell test , i.e. , two  body correlations .",
    "we answered this question positively in ref .",
    "@xcite by proposing classes of bell inequalities constructed from one- and two - body expectation values , and , more importantly , providing examples of physically relevant many - body quantum states ( i.e. , gss or low energy states of physically relevant hamiltonians ) that violate these inequalities .",
    "note that finding and classifying such states is an interesting task in itself , especially in view of the fact that many genuinely entangled quantum many - body states have two - body reduced density matrices ( or , in other words , covariance matrices ) that are compatible with two - body reduced density matrices of some separable state .",
    "this is the case of the so - called _ graph states _ , as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite ; obviously one can not detect entanglement of such states with two - body correlators , not even mentioning nonlocality .",
    "it should also be stressed that an analogous question was already explored in the case of entanglement , which next to nonlocality is a key resource quantum information theory .",
    "several entanglement criteria relying solely on two - body expectation values have been proposed @xcite .",
    "in particular , in @xcite the possibility of addressing two - body statistics ( although not individually ) _ via _ collective observables was exploited .",
    "the main aims of this work are two - fold .",
    "first , we present a detailed derivation of multipartite bell inequalities involving only one- and two - body correlators , and pertaining to permutation symmetry between the involved parties presented in @xcite . to this end",
    "we characterize the polytope of lhv correlations in such case .",
    "we then discuss the maximal quantum violations of these inequalities in the general case , including its scaling with the number of parties .",
    "we pay particular attention to bell inequalities violated by the family of dicke states that are the ground states of physically relevant and experimentally realizable hamiltonians .",
    "we discuss shortly various scenarios for detection of non - locality in mesoscopic systems of trapped ions or atoms , and by atoms trapped in the vicinity of designed nanostructures .",
    "the second aim is to strongly develop and generalize the results of ref .",
    "first , we impose conditions under which our bell inequalities are tight .",
    "then , we provide a new class of two - body bell inequalities which reveal nonlocality in all the entangled dicke states , not only those studied in @xcite .",
    "finally , we construct and characterize an analytical class of pure states that well approximate states maximally violating some of our bell inequalities . with their aid",
    "we can analytically compute the maximal violation of these bell inequalities in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the manuscript is organized in sections , in which we define the problem and present the results .",
    "all the technical proofs and demonstrations , as well as a discussion of concrete experiments aimed at generation of the dicke states , are shifted to the three appendices . in section ii we describe the generic bell experiment , using the contemporary language of device - independent quantum information theory in terms of conditional probabilities for @xmath2 parties compatible with the no - signalling principle .",
    "the structure of the polytope defined by the local correlations ( local bell polytope ) is discussed in section [ sec : projecting ] . here",
    "we first describe the general case , then how we can restrict the analysis to a smaller polytope using a general symmetry group , and finally we focus on the permutationally invariant bell polytope . in section",
    "[ sec : classes ] various classes of bell inequalities are derived and discussed .",
    "section [ sec : quantum ] is devoted to results concerning maximal quantum violation of the derived inequalities .",
    "we present here also analytical expressions for a class of states that violate the derived bell inequalities , and such that the analytical violation converges to the maximal numerical one as @xmath2 becomes large .",
    "various aspects of the robustness of these inequalities and their violations are analyzed here , with an emphasis on the limit of a large number of parties . in section [ sec : dicke ] we focus on inequalities detecting nonlocality of the entangled dicke states , and discuss also their parameter dependence .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] contains a short conclusion , and a discussion of several promising experimental systems in which the proposed bell test could be successfully implemented : mesoscopic systems of ultracold trapped ions , neutral atoms in a single , or double well trap , or atoms near tapered optical fibers and nanostructured optical crystals .",
    "appendix [ appa ] contains the proofs of all the theorems from sections [ sec : projecting]-[sec : dicke ] , while appendix [ appb ] presents some details concerning the block - diagonalization of the bell operator , necessary to determine the maximal quantum violation . as mentioned above , appendix [ appc ] contains detailed calculations concerning the robustness to experimental errors of the 2-body bell inequalities .",
    "these calculations are relevant for the potential implementation of the derived bell inequalities , for instance in the recent experiment of ref .",
    "let us consider the standard multipartite bell - type scenario in which @xmath2 spatially separated observers , denoted @xmath3 share some @xmath2-partite resource . on their share of this resource every observer @xmath4 can perform one of @xmath5 measurements , each having @xmath6 outcomes . in what follows these measurements",
    "are denoted by @xmath7 with @xmath8 , while their outcomes by @xmath9 .",
    "this scenario is usually referred to as @xmath10 .",
    "the correlations between results obtained in the above experiment are described in terms of the conditional probabilities @xmath11 that the @xmath12th party obtained @xmath13 upon performing the measurement @xmath7 .",
    "it is convenient to collect all the probabilities in ( [ eq : probabilitatcondicionada ] ) into a vector with @xmath14 components , each corresponding to a different combination of outcomes @xmath15 and measurements choices @xmath16 .",
    "let us call such vector @xmath17 .",
    "clearly , one must ask for probabilities to be non - negative , that is , @xmath18 must hold for all choices of @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and normalized , meaning that @xmath19 is satisfied for any sequence @xmath16 .",
    "the latter condition implies that only @xmath20 of the components of @xmath17 are independent .",
    "let us also notice that all the above constraints define a region in space , which is a polytope , denoted @xmath21 , to which any mathematically consistent @xmath17 belongs . recall that a polytope is a compact convex set with a finite number of extreme points .",
    "now , depending on the nature of the @xmath2-partite resource that the parties share , different types of correlations can be obtained .",
    "we are mainly interested in three scenarios : the case in which @xmath17 admits a local hidden variable ( lhv ) model , the case in which @xmath17 can be obtained through performing local measurements on quantum states ( q ) and the case in which @xmath17 fulfils the no - signalling principle ( ns ) .    _ lhv correlations .",
    "_ those conditional probability distributions that @xmath17 have a local hidden variable model have the following form : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is some hidden variable , distributed according to a probability density @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the space of hidden variables .",
    "operationally , the interpretation of ( [ eq : lhvmodel ] ) is that the outcome @xmath13 of the @xmath26-th measurement is produced locally at site @xmath12 as a function of the input @xmath26 and the value of this hidden variable @xmath27 .",
    "the resulting probability distribution is the one corresponding to our understanding of the _ classical correlations between local independent measurements _ : in order to simulate correlations @xmath17 of this form , parties could gather beforehand and agree on which @xmath27 to pick at each run of the experiment , distributed according to @xmath24 .",
    "this information , called also shared randomness is precisely the resource needed  given @xmath27 and @xmath26 , each party would just simulate @xmath28 on their own .",
    "the feasibility region for lhv model probability distributions is a polytope and its vertices are given by those @xmath17 in which all parties follow a local deterministic strategy",
    ". we shall denote this polytope @xmath29 .",
    "the vertices of @xmath29 are straightforward to construct as these are those @xmath17 s for which all probabilities ( [ eq : probabilitatcondicionada ] ) factorize : @xmath30 and each factor is deterministic , i.e. , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the kronecker delta function and @xmath33 is a different integer for every vertex .",
    "one immediately finds that in the @xmath10 scenario the number of vertices is @xmath34 .    _",
    "quantum correlations .",
    "_ imagine now that the resource the parties share is some @xmath2-partite quantum state @xmath35 acting on a product hilbert space @xmath36 of local dimension @xmath37 .",
    "in such case , each local measurement @xmath7 can be thought of as a collection of positive semi - definite operators @xmath38 corresponding to outcomes @xmath39 and obeying @xmath40 for every @xmath26 and @xmath12 .",
    "then , the probabilities ( [ eq : probabilitatcondicionada ] ) can be represented _ via _ born s rule : @xmath41 the feasibility region for probability distributions of the form ( [ eq : bornsrule ] ) is a convex set , denoted @xmath42 . unlike the local set , @xmath42 is not a polytope and hence its boundary is more difficult to characterize .",
    "still , it can be well approximated @xcite .",
    "_ non - signalling correlations .",
    "_ for completeness of this work it is worth recalling the notion of non - signalling correlations .",
    "these are those @xmath17 s that fulfil the no - signalling principle which says that information can not be transmitted instantaneously .",
    "this means that in the above bell scenario the choice of measurement made by one party can not influence the statistics seen by the remaining parties . in terms of the conditional probabilities ( [ eq : probabilitatcondicionada ] ) this is equivalent to a set of linear constraints of the form @xmath43 for all @xmath44 and @xmath45 and @xmath46 and all @xmath12 .",
    "the feasibility region corresponding to distributions @xmath17 satisfying the no - signalling principle , which we denote @xmath47 , is again a polytope , as it is an intersection of the polytope @xmath48 with the linear subspace defined by ( [ eq : nsprinciple ] ) .",
    "however , unlike in the case of the local polytope @xmath29 , the vertices of @xmath47 are in general difficult to characterize , and except for the simplest scenarios @xmath49 @xcite and @xmath50 @xcite and they are unknown ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "when the no - signalling constraints and the normalization conditions are taken into consideration , the number of independent variables of any @xmath51 is reduced to @xmath52^n-1 $ ] which is the dimension of the polytope @xmath47 and so is the dimension of the remaining two sets @xmath29 and @xmath42 .",
    "importantly , these three sets are different .",
    "in fact , one has the following chain of inclusions : @xmath53 first , @xmath54 because all correlations belonging to @xmath29 can be realized with separable states . yet , due to the celebrated bell s theorem @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "second , @xmath56 because all correlations given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : bornsrule ] ) trivially satisfy the no - signalling principle . on the other hand , there exist correlations obeying the no - signalling principle which are not quantum , with the most paradigmatic example being the so - called popescu - rohrlich box @xcite .",
    "hence , @xmath57 . finally , it is easy to verify that not all elements of @xmath48 satisfy the no - singalling principle , and therefore @xmath58 .    due to the structure of the local polytope @xmath29 , the natural way of checking whether @xmath59 is to use bell inequalities .",
    "these are linear inequalities formulated in terms of the probabilities resulting from the local measurements performed by the observers , that is , @xmath60 where @xmath61 are some coefficients and @xmath62 is the so - called classical bound of the bell inequality .",
    "violation of such inequalities signals nonlocality .",
    "all polytopes admit a dual description : they can be completely characterized either by listing all their vertices ( _ i.e. _ , a point @xmath17 belongs to a polytope @xmath48 if and only if it is a convex combination of its vertices ) or as the intersection of a number of half - spaces .",
    "such intersection can be taken to be minimal and in this case every of these half - spaces intersected with @xmath48 defines a facet of @xmath48 .",
    "nevertheless , going from one description to the other is not a simple task in general .",
    "the best known algorithm @xcite has complexity @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the number of vertices ( facets ) of the polytope and @xmath37 is the dimension of the space in which the polytope lives . in the case of @xmath29 ,",
    "its vertices , although there are many , are straightforward to find , but not its facets , which give rise to the so - called _ tight bell inequalities_. only few scenarios have been completely characterized , none of them with more than @xmath65 parties @xcite . in the case of @xmath47",
    "the situation is the opposite : its facets are easy to construct , since they are the @xmath14 positivity constraints on every probability ( [ eq : probabilitatcondicionada ] ) , but its vertices , known as extreme non - signalling boxes , are hard to find . in this case only few scenarios have been solved @xcite .    for further benefits",
    "let us eventually mention that in the case @xmath66 , which is the case we mostly consider in this work , it is convenient to re - label outcomes from @xmath67 to @xmath68 ( _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath69 ) , and re - express all probabilities ( [ eq : probabilitatcondicionada ] ) in terms of expectation values @xmath70 for @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "below , the number of parties appearing in such a correlators will also be referred to as order of the correlator ; for instance , correlators @xmath74 are of order two . as a direct consequence of ( [ eq : lhvvertex ] ) , the vertices of @xmath29 are in this case given by @xmath75 where each local expectation value @xmath76 equals either @xmath77 or @xmath78 .",
    "in the present work we are interested in the study of non - locality in many - body quantum systems consisting of a large number of parties @xmath2 . finding all the facets of the corresponding local polytope @xmath29 ( that give rise to the optimal bell inequalities ) would completely characterize it and would be the first step to answer the above question .",
    "unfortunately , even in the simplest case of @xmath79 but for large @xmath2 , @xmath29 is an object of tremendous complexity , and attempting to characterize it following this approach becomes an intractable task .",
    "since both its dimension and its number of vertices are exponential in @xmath2 , we aim at projecting @xmath29 onto a simpler object , which has less vertices and which is embedded in a lower - dimensional space .",
    "this simplification does not come for free and the obtained bell inequalities would , in general , be weaker .",
    "if one applies a projection @xmath80 to @xmath29 , then @xmath81 can only give sufficient conditions for nonlocality @xcite .",
    "if some correlations @xmath17 are nonlocal , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath82 , it may happen that @xmath83 or @xmath84 , depending on the projection @xmath80 . however , if @xmath83 , then @xmath85 .",
    "hence , violating a bell inequality corresponding to @xmath81 certifies nonlocality , while proving that correlations that lie inside @xmath81 is inconclusive . in this section",
    "we then discuss how to choose @xmath80 in such a way that , on one hand , the bell inequalities constraining @xmath81 are powerful enough to reveal nonlocality for arbitrary @xmath2 , and , on the other hand , they are accessible with current experimental technology .",
    "more precisely , we want to find bell inequalities containing only one- and two - body correlators . to further simplify the problem we also demand that additionally they obey certain symmetries . from a more fundamental point of view",
    ", we also want to answer the question of what is the minimal amount of information that it is required in order to detect non - locality .",
    "we shall simplify @xmath29 in two steps : one is to reduce the order of the correlators ( [ eq : probabilitatcondicionada ] ) , and the other is the application of a symmetry group @xmath86 such that the obtained bell inequalities remain invariant under the permutation by any element of @xmath86 . by reducing the amount of correlators in @xmath87 to those that involve at most @xmath88 parties ,",
    "the dimension of @xmath29 is reduced from @xmath89 to @xmath90 and the number of vertices is kept the same . each term in the above sum corresponds to correlators of exactly @xmath91 parties ",
    "there are @xmath92 ways to choose them .",
    "when the @xmath91 parties are chosen , each of the members can choose one of @xmath5 measurements , with @xmath93 independent probabilities ( the @xmath6-th one is determined from the fact that the sum of probabilities of all outcomes is equal to 1 ) ; this amounts to the factor @xmath94 .",
    "we denote by @xmath95 the polytope obtained by _ not including _ the correlators of order higher than @xmath88 .    on the other hand",
    ", one can look for bell inequalities that are invariant under the action of some symmetry group @xmath86 which permutes the parties .",
    "the reason to consider this approach that imposes extra constraints is twofold : firstly , even if @xmath95 is simpler than the whole polytope , its number of vertices is still exponential and its dimension goes like @xmath96 , which can still grow fast with @xmath2 . adding the permutation symmetry produces a simpler polytope . secondly , as we will see below , imposing permutation symmetry allows for deriving bell inequalities that can be measured with techniques readily accessible in experiments .",
    "let us consider a group @xmath86 , which is a subgroup of the group of permutations of @xmath2 elements , denoted @xmath97 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath98 the set of all @xmath88-body conditional probabilities : @xmath99 @xmath86 acts on @xmath98 by permuting the indices of the parties @xmath100 .",
    "formally , we have defined an action @xmath101 by : @xmath102 every action of a group on a set induces a partition of the set into orbits .",
    "given a probability @xmath103 , we denote its orbit by @xmath104=\\{g(\\sigma , p),\\ \\sigma \\in g\\}$ ] and the set of orbits by @xmath105 .",
    "note that a given probability @xmath106 can only belong to one orbit .",
    "thus , we can express @xmath98 as the disjoint union of all its orbits .",
    "@xmath107\\in { \\cal p}_k / g}[p].\\ ] ] the sum of all elements in @xmath104 $ ] is , by construction , invariant under the action of any element @xmath108 .",
    "let us then define _ @xmath86-invariant probabilities _ as sums of probabilities that are invariant under the action of @xmath86 , that is , @xmath109}\\propto \\sum_{p\\in [ p]}p\\ ] ] for all @xmath104\\in { \\cal p}_k / g$ ] ( there are clearly as many @xmath86-invariant probabilities as elements in @xmath105 ) . accordingly",
    ", we define the symmetric polytope of @xmath88-body probabilities , denoted @xmath110 , as the image of @xmath111 under the projection ( [ eq : g - invariant - correlator ] ) .",
    "its dimension is the number of @xmath86-invariant probabilities obtained from @xmath105 .",
    "note that in ( [ eq : g - invariant - correlator ] ) we have defined the @xmath86-invariant probabilities up to a proportionality constant .",
    "this , however , does not change the shape of the polytope ( _ i.e. _ its number of vertices and/or facets and their arrangement ) .",
    "note that @xmath110 is indeed a polytope , because eq . ( [ eq : g - invariant - correlator ] ) defines a linear projection .",
    "so , @xmath110 can be completely characterized by listing its vertices .",
    "however , we are interested in finding the vertices of @xmath110 directly , without first constructing the vertices of @xmath112 ( of which there is an exponential amount ) and then projecting each of them by means of ( [ eq : g - invariant - correlator ] ) .    as the projection ( [ eq : g - invariant - correlator ] ) from @xmath112 to @xmath110 is a linear map",
    ", every vertex of @xmath110 has to be the image of a vertex of @xmath112 under this projection .",
    "the converse is not true in general , because a vertex of @xmath112 can be mapped by ( [ eq : g - invariant - correlator ] ) to the interior of @xmath110 .",
    "since every set of deterministic local strategies that give the same value in each ( [ eq : g - invariant - correlator ] ) is a candidate to a vertex , counting the number of them will give us an useful upper bound to the number of vertices in @xmath110 . to this end , we will make use of plya s enumeration theorem @xcite .",
    "every deterministic local strategy assigns to each party a list of the predetermined outcomes for all its measurements .",
    "so , it can be thought of as a function @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the set @xmath115 , which indexes the parties and @xmath116 is the set of @xmath5-tuples @xmath117 with @xmath118 , in which @xmath119 is the outcome assigned to the @xmath12-th measurement .",
    "the set of all @xmath120 s is denoted @xmath121 .",
    "permutation of the parties defines , in a similar fashion as in ( [ eq : partition ] ) , a partition @xmath122 of the set of local deterministic strategies : two deterministic local strategies , @xmath123 and @xmath124 , belong to the same class in @xmath122 if and only if there exists a permutation @xmath108 , such that when applied to the parties in @xmath123 , we obtain @xmath124 .",
    "plya s enumeration theorem states that the number of such classes is given by @xmath125 counts the number of disjoint cycles of the permutation @xmath126 . because every permutation decomposes into a product of disjoint cycles uniquely ( up to permuting the cycles ) , @xmath127 is well defined .",
    "both the dimension and the number of vertices depend on the group @xmath86 considered , and there is clearly a trade - off between the number of elements in @xmath86 , the number of vertices , and the dimension of @xmath110 : the bigger the symmetry group @xmath86 , the smaller the dimension of @xmath128 and the smaller the number of vertices .",
    "+ * example * let us illustrate this result with an example , in which @xmath86 is the group generated by the shift to the right : @xmath129 . in this case , one obtains bell inequalities which are translationally invariant @xcite .",
    "one can show that @xmath130 of @xmath2 , denoted @xmath131 , and @xmath132 is euler s totient function , which counts how many integers @xmath133 with @xmath134 are coprime with @xmath135 , ( _ i.e. _ , their greatest common divisor is @xmath136 ) .",

    "in this paper we have constructed and classified bell inequalities involving 1-body and 2-body correlators of many - body systems .",
    "we studied maximal quantum violations of these inequalities , as well as robustness of these violations and dependence with respect to various parameters involved .",
    "we paid particular attention to bell inequalities that are violated by dicke states that have physical relevance : on one hand they can be prepared in experiments , on the other hand they appear as ground states of physically relevant models , such as the lipkin - meshkov - glick model .",
    "let us conclude by listing several experimental setups in which nonlocality in many body systems may be tested using our inequalities :    * * ultracold trapped atoms .",
    "* dicke states have been recently created in spinor bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) of rubidium @xmath578 atoms , via the parametric process of spin changing collisions , in which two @xmath579 collide to produce a @xmath580 pair @xcite .",
    "these recent experiments demonstrate the production of many thousands of neutral atoms entangled in their spin degrees of freedom .",
    "dicke - like states can be produced in this way , with at least 28-particle genuine multiparty entanglement and a generalized squeezing parameter of @xmath581 db .",
    "similarly , rubidium atoms of pseudo - spin 1/2 in bec may be employed to generate scalable squeezed states ( for the early theory proposal see @xcite , for experiments see @xcite ) .",
    "very recently non - squeezed ( non - gaussian ) entangled states of many atoms @xcite were generated in this way .",
    "the number of atoms used in these experiments are of order of thousands and larger .",
    "so far , these numbers and experimental errors and imperfections are too large , while the corresponding fidelities too small to detect many body nonlocality . in principle , however , it is possible to perform these experiments with mesoscopic atom numbers ( say @xmath582 , controlling the atom number to a single atom level ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the resonant fluorescence detection of rb@xmath583 atoms in a mot , and refs .",
    "@xcite for optically trapped spin 1/2 fermions ) . *",
    "* ultracold trapped ions .",
    "* ultracold trapped ions with internal pseudo - spin `` talk '' to each other via phonon excitations , and under some conditions behave as spin chains with long range interaction .",
    "this was originally proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , using inhomogeneous magnetic fields , and in ref .",
    "@xcite , employing appropriately designed laser - ion interactions .",
    "the pioneering experiments were reported in refs . @xcite .",
    "while in the early theory studies @xcite spin interactions decaying with the third power of the distance were considered , it was experimentally demonstrated that management of phonon dispersion allows to achieve powers between 0.1 and 3 in the 2d arrays of traps @xcite .",
    "recent state of art represents the work on experimental realization of a quantum integer - spin chain with controllable interactions @xcite .",
    "we have studied trapped ion systems in relation to long range @xmath584 spin chains and quantum chaos @xcite , and trapped - ion quantum simulation of tunable - range heisenberg chains @xcite . in the latter paper we demonstrated that significant violation of the bell inequalities , discussed in the present paper , is possible even for the ground states of the models with large , but finite interaction range .",
    "* * ultracold atoms in nanostructures .",
    "* yet another possibility concerns systems of ultracold atoms traps in a vicinity of tapered fibers and optical crystals ( band gap materials ) .",
    "the experimental progress in coupling of ultracold atomic gases to nanophotonic waveguides , initiated by refs .",
    "@xcite , is very rapid ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . early theoretical studies concerned remarkable optical properties of these systems ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . ideas and proposals concerning realization of long range spin models",
    "were developed more recently , and mainly in refs .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "* * cold and ultracold atomic ensembles . *",
    "last , but not least , one should consider cold and ultracold ensembles ( for an excellent review see @xcite ) , in which , by employing quantum faraday effect , one can reach unprecendented degeees of squeezing of the total atomic spin ( cf .",
    "@xcite , and unprecendented degrees of precision of quantum magnetometry ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . note that in many concrete realisations the many body bell inequalities derived in this paper require precise measurments of the total spin components , and their quantum fluctuations .",
    "quantum faraday effect , or in other words spin polarization spectroscopy , seems to be a perfect method to achieve this goal ; note that in principle it allows also to reach spatial resolution , and/or to measure spatial fourier components of the total spin @xcite .",
