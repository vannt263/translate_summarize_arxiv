    "although it is one of the most investigated models of statistical mechanics , the still - unsolved ising model in three dimensions has recently again come under the spotlight @xcite .",
    "this is because of ( i ) controversial claims as to the exact values of the critical exponents from analytical means and ( ii ) advances in algorithmic approaches which have allowed for greater numerical precision .    on the analytic side ,",
    "two relatively recent papers claim to have found the exact exponents of the 3d ising model @xcite .",
    "they claim rational values for the critical exponents , including @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "a speculative formula embracing the results for the magnetic exponent @xmath10 was subsequently given in ref.@xcite and the conjectured values for critical parameters in three dimensions were used in ref.@xcite . despite criticism in refs.@xcite , experimental support for these critical exponents has been claimed in ref.@xcite .",
    "further theoretical arguments in favour of these exponents are given in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "refs.@xcite also advocate the existence of a multiplicative logarithmic correction in the critical behaviour of the specific heat in the model .",
    "given the intriguing coincidence of the claimed values of the critical exponents in ref.@xcite and ref.@xcite , and their connection with the rosengren conjecture @xcite , precise measurement of @xmath3 and @xmath2 are of renewed interest .",
    "precision is important here , not least because if any disagreement with rg is found , this will have serious implications for one of the foundation stones of theoretical physics .",
    "this is also why the claims of refs.@xcite caused so much controversy ",
    "they are not in agreement with precise , though non - exact , results from other methods . moreover , while the values of the critical exponents claimed in refs.@xcite obey the standard scaling relations , a logarithmic term in the specific heat would violate the scaling relations for logarithmic corrections unless certain conditions hold for the for the locus of fisher zeros @xcite .",
    "although critical exponents have more commonly been used , amplitude ratios often offer a more discerning way to identify universality classes @xcite . these have again recently received",
    "increased attention in the case of the of the 3d ising model because improved numerical techniques now permit more stringent investigations .",
    "the most recent monte carlo simulations have yielded the estimates @xmath11 @xcite and @xmath12 @xcite and these compare well with previous estimates from a variety of approaches in table  1 .",
    "the first entry in the table is conspicuous in that ( i ) it is significantly different to the other estimates and ( ii ) it comes from measuring the angle of impact of complex - temperature fisher zeros onto the critical point , instead of through the more direct approaches employed by the other references cited .",
    "therefore we considered it worthwhile revisiting this method , making use of the greater computational power available today , in an effort to determine whether the inconsistency is indicative of a deeper problem or whether it is simply down to limited numerics .",
    "for these reasons , our analysis focuses on the scaling and impact angles .",

    "because of recent claims around the values of the critical exponents of the three - dimensional ising model , and in the light of renewed interest in the measurements of amplitude ratios in this model , we decided to investigate this well - studied model from an alternative perspective , namely that of complex - temperature zeros .",
    "in particular , the manner in which such zeros impact onto the real axis dictates the amplitude ratios for the specific heat . only very old ( almost 3 decades old ) measurements of this impact angle exist in the literature , so another motivation was to investigate this using the powerful algorithms and large lattices currently at our disposal .",
    "indeed , we have found that previous measurements of the impact angle were made on lattices which were too small to manifest conformality in the complex temperature plane .    in the absence of a finite - size scaling theory for the impact angle",
    ", we were able to estimate upper and lower bounds for its value .",
    "these lead to an estimate @xmath4 , which in turn leads to an estimate for the amplitude ratio of @xmath13 .",
    "in addition to the amplitude ratios , we investigated the correlation - length critical exponent and determined that @xmath6 .",
    "the corresponding value for the specific - heat critical exponent is @xmath7 , from hyperscaling .",
    "these values are compatible with the most accurate recent measurements , and therefore reinforce confidence in our estimates for the impact angle .",
    "all of our estimates are consistent with the values currently widely accepted and are incompatible with the values recently claimed in refs.@xcite .    * acknowledgements : * rk acknowleges support from eu programme fp7-people-2010-irses ( project no 269139 ) , and the arf scheme of coventry university .",

    "in fss theory , the shift exponent @xmath14 characterizes the scaling of the pseudocritical point towards the critical point as the thermodynamic limit is approached .",
    "the pseudocritical point is given by the location of the specific - heat maximum or by the real part of the first fisher zero and the approach is as @xmath15 .",
    "in most models exhibiting higher - order phase transitions , the shift exponent @xmath14 coincides with the inverse of the correlation - length critical exponent @xmath16 , but this is not a direct conclusion of fss theory and is not always true .    for example , for the ising model in two dimensions , ferdinand and fisher determined that the specific - heat pseudocritical point scales with @xmath17 @xcite . however , ising models defined on other two - dimensional lattices with different topologies have shift exponents which differ from the inverse correlation length critical exponent ( see ref.@xcite for a discussion and references therein ) . this is despite the fact that the critical properties on such lattices are the same as for the torus in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "here we ask the question : is there a criterion for @xmath18 ?",
    "we find that there is such a criterion  the specific - heat amplitude ratio must be @xmath19 .",
    "although a detailed fss theory for the impact angle is lacking , for sufficiently large @xmath20 one may expect that @xmath1 is approximated by the angle subtended by the first zero on the real axis at the critical point , @xmath21}{{\\rm{re } } [ u^{(1)}(l ) ] - u_c }      \\propto \\frac{l^{-1/\\nu}}{l^{-\\lambda } } \\sim c l^{\\lambda - 1/\\nu } + \\dots.\\ ] ] to find the angle @xmath1 , let @xmath22 . if , as in most cases , @xmath23 , then @xmath24 , some constant value . if @xmath25 then @xmath26 .",
    "but this is impossible as @xmath14 can not be less than @xmath16 ( otherwise @xmath2 _ becomes _ @xmath27 ) .",
    "the only possibility to have @xmath18 , then , is for @xmath28 . in this case",
    "@xmath29 diverges as @xmath22 , so that @xmath30 . from ( [ ratio ] ) ,",
    "then , one finds @xmath31 .",
    "this is precisely what happens in the ising and potts models in @xmath32 , where the coincidence of the specific - heat amplitudes is guaranteed by self - duality .",

    "after submission of this work , we became aware of a recent extended scaling approach by campbell and lundow @xcite which yields a universal amplitude ratio @xmath33 .",
    "this value is also compatible with the estimate presented herein ."
