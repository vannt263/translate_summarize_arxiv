    "the technological applications of optical vortices range from optical tweezers and particle manipulation  @xcite to quantum information  @xcite .",
    "moreover , there is a growing interest in using beams with nontrivial phase as building blocks for a new generation of traps for ultracold atoms , where the particles are indeed confined in the dark areas of the beam  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the external control of the propagation of phase singularities linked to the regions of the beam where the intensity vanishes is an essential question .    in 3d ,",
    "the propagation of the phase singularities follow vortex lines or _",
    "dark rays_. a single optical vortex with @xmath0 continuous symmetry presents a phase singularity located at the axis of symmetry , and its topological charge corresponds to its oam .",
    "the corresponding dark ray is simply a straight line coinciding with the axis of symmetry .",
    "a number of stationary vortices are characterized by these dark rays , which can form knots or braids , whose study is of central interest due to their potential technological applications  @xcite .",
    "these dark rays , considered as the trajectories of vortices propagating through certain medium , can be controlled by means of either non - cylindrically symmetric input wave - fronts or symmetric ones propagating in inhomogeneous or nonlinear media , thus allowing for the inversion of the charge of the initial vortex  @xcite .",
    "a different approach considers the controllable transformation of a single optical vortex with @xmath0 continuous symmetry in a vortex featuring different on - axis charge by means of a system showing discrete rotational symmetry .",
    "this phenomenon , known as _ vortex transmutation _",
    "@xcite , was experimentally demonstrated in optically induced photonic lattices  @xcite and recently , for the first time , in _ free space _ using _ linear _ polygonal lenses  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the unveiling of the oam by diffracting a vortex with a triangular aperture  @xcite can be understood in the light of this phenomenon .",
    "the process of vortex transmutation , governed by the simple symmetry rule established in  @xcite , was proven to be a consequence of the generation of a number of optical vortices on - axis which propagate off - axis  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we experimentally demonstrate the generation and control of these off - axis singularities ( oas ) by means of a _ thin _ discrete symmetry diffractive element ( dsde ) in free space , and show that the corresponding dark rays are straight lines .",
    "these results confirm the theory developed in ref .",
    "the generation of oas is closely related to the phenomenon of vortex transmutation @xcite , which occurs when a highly - charged vortex owning @xmath0 continuous symmetry illuminates a medium with discrete rotational symmetry of @xmath1th order ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the breaking of @xmath0 into @xmath2 produces four major effects : ( i ) oam is no longer conserved , and vortex solutions are not eigenfunctions of @xmath3 with eigenvalue @xmath4 @xcite ; ( ii ) a quantity @xmath5 called angular pseudo - momentum is conserved instead of @xmath4 @xcite ; ( iii ) an upper cutoff applies to the topological charge @xmath6 of a single phase singularity : @xmath7 @xcite ; and ( iv ) , a disintegration of a single phase singularity located at the symmetry axis occurs when @xmath8 verifying the following transmutation rule @xmath9    where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the charges of the central singularity before and after the breaking , respectively @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations show that transmutation is accompanied by the appearance of @xmath12 oas moving outward from the symmetry axis  @xcite .",
    "although this result was obtained by assuming illumination of a _ thick _ @xmath13-invariant discrete _ nonlinear _ medium , the @xmath14 breaking mechanism is a linear phenomenon .",
    "experimental observation of the transmutation of the central charge has been recently reported  @xcite .",
    "the theory of oas in free - space vortex transmutation has been recently developed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this reference , trajectories of the oas",
    "have been analytically calculated in the case of a _ thin _",
    "dsde illuminated by a laguerre - gaussian ( lg ) beam with charge @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the main results of this theory are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : theory_dsde ] for the case @xmath15 .",
    "the dark ray associated to the central singularity does not experience any deviation after the action of the dsde .",
    "however , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) singularities with @xmath18 follow trajectories bifurcating from the central ray at the dsde position .",
    "they verify the transmutation rule : @xmath19 ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) , conserving charge .",
    "asymptotically , these @xmath16 dark rays follow straight lines .",
    "the polar @xmath22 and axial @xmath23 angles of the dark rays are completely determined by the parameters of the dsde and the input lg beam .",
    "in particular , the polar angle of the @xmath24th dark ray is given by @xmath25 with @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the axial angle is given by @xmath27 $ ] ( @xmath28 ) , where @xmath29 is the width of the input lg beam , @xmath30 is its wavelength and @xmath31 is a dimensionless parameter measuring the strength of the @xmath32 breaking . remarkably , the dark rays divergence @xmath33 is proportional to the waist @xmath29 , unlike the beam divergence ( bright region ) which is proportional to @xmath34 ( see ref .",

    "in the insets of fig . [ exp_setup ] , we display the transverse intensity distribution recorded by the ccd at a distance @xmath44 cm from the beam splitter bs2 .",
    "the output pattern is composed by five regions where intensity vanishes ( see fig .",
    "[ exp_setup]a ) , which , in addition , turn out to be the locations of the arising phase singularities . because the dsde employed in our experiments is an amplitude object , the obtained far - field diffraction patterns are strongly distorted , and so additional diagnostics are needed in order to ensure the resulting phase distribution .",
    "notice that a clear analysis of the latter is crucial to have a detailed insight of the vortex transmutation process .",
    "thus , we have adopted two complementary strategies to unambiguously discriminate the phase singularities from other low - intensity regions in the observation plane .",
    "first , as singularities are zeros of the optical field , we can identify them clearly by increasing the beam intensity , thus improving the background contrast accordingly ( see fig .",
    "[ exp_setup]b ) .",
    "second , we were able to observe directly both positions and charges of the phase singularities using the interferometric setup displayed in fig .",
    "[ exp_setup ] .",
    "hence , the vortices are identified via the fork - like patterns they produce as a result of their interference with a tilted light beam without nested singularities , coming from the second arm of the interferometer . as predicted by theory",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : theory_dsde ] ) , the central dislocation transmutes its charge from @xmath20 to @xmath21 , and @xmath16 oas with charge @xmath18 each bifurcate from the original vortex @xmath20 at the position of the dsde according to its @xmath39 symmetry ( see fig . 2c ) .",
    "our procedure delivers a fully reliable picture of the whole phase portrait since the interferometric resolution can be tuned at each observation distance by adjusting the relative angle between the beams coming from both interferometer arms .",
    "we have also analyzed the dynamics of the oas by following their evolution over long distances .",
    "the results are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : vortex_diffraction_images ] .",
    "remarkably , the central transmuted singularity does not change the initial trajectory remaining at the origin , while oas do deviate ( see interferogram in fig .",
    "[ fig : vortex_diffraction_images](f ) ) . as experimentally demonstrated in fig .",
    "4 , oas follow straight dark rays preserving @xmath39 symmetry . particularly , they display a different behavior of their divergence with respect to the waist @xmath29 when compared to the diffraction of the bright ring of the beam ( see sec .  [ sec:1 ] ) .",
    "differences in the slopes of the lines represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : off_singularities_position ] can be attributed to distortions caused by the high sensitivity to alignment of the setup .",
    "we must point out that the solely monitoring of the phase singularity placed upon the optical axis is not enough to demonstrate the transmutation process , since the transformations in this singularity are compatible with the decay of the initial highly - charged vortex due to a small perturbation  @xcite .",
    "in fact , we checked that a small misalignment of the setup causes an immediate conversion of the initial charge @xmath20 into three single charges @xmath18 .",
    "such behavior turns out to be very similar to that reported in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the authors observed the decay of a single vortex of charge @xmath45 into @xmath46 single - charged vortices due to astigmatism .",
    "thus , some remnant aberrations of our telescopic system , together with the symmetry breakdown from the misaligned dsde , may explain the decay to @xmath47 single - charged vortices of our initial vortex beam .",
    "then , the vortex transmutation phenomenon discussed in this paper clearly overcomes that astigmatic breaking mechanism when the system is properly aligned and almost free of major optical aberrations . in such case , the observation of oas allows to disentangle both phenomena without any ambiguity .    finally , we observed a slight rotation of the whole pattern ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vortex_diffraction_images ] ) . whilst",
    "such rotation can be compatible with the theoretical description , some distortion due to the optical system can also yield to similar results .    .",
    "the bottom singularities , whose evolution is omitted for simplicity , follow the same linear behavior with slightly different slopes.,width=283 ]",
    "we have experimentally demonstrated the generation of oas in free - space vortex transmutation by means of a dsde .",
    "we have shown that oas follow straight dark rays in the form predicted by recent theory  @xcite .",
    "our study opens the door to the full control over both the generation and evolution of deterministic patterns of phase singularities by means of dsdes .",
    "these results can lead to relevant applications in fields such as particle manipulation , quantum information , and ultracold atom trapping , in which the non - trivial phase pattern of new types of optical beams characterized by multiple phase singularities , as those presented here , can play a key role .",
