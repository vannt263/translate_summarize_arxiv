    "the application of color centers in diamond for quantum information processing and quantum communication enormously profits from coupling to optical cavities @xcite : the effects range from simple enhancement of the collection efficiency , which would be beneficial e.g. for remote entanglement schemes @xcite relying on efficient interference of photons from independent emitters , to cavity - enabled schemes like efficient readout of the spin - state @xcite or architectures for scalable quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "the most prominent color centers in diamond are the nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) and silicon - vacancy ( siv ) centers : nv centers @xcite have been proven to provide all essential requirements for quantum information processing @xcite such as storing , processing and transmitting quantum information .",
    "their success is largely due to the long spin coherence times @xcite and strongly selective spin - dependent fluorescence .",
    "on the other hand , siv centers feature very narrow emission lines even at room temperature @xcite which clearly distinguishes them from the broad - band nv center emission .",
    "in addition , very recently , evidence for an optically accessible electron spin of the siv center has been reported @xcite possibly enabling spin - photon quantum interfaces .",
    "the coupling of single color centers to optical cavities with very small modal volume , i.e. photonic crystal ( phc ) cavities , has been demonstrated for single nv centers @xcite at cryogenic temperatures necessary to reduce the zero - phonon line ( zpl ) broadening . in these experiments",
    "the color centers position within the cavities was completely random and cavity - emitter systems were selected after fabrication for optimum coupling . here ,",
    "on the contrary , we investigate the deterministic coupling of single siv centers to phc cavities by a tailored fabrication process : we fabricate monolithic phc cavities in single crystal diamond around pre - characterized siv centers , enabling deterministic emitter positioning and controlled alignment of its dipole axis with the cavity electric field .",
    "furthermore , we profit from the unique spectral properties of the siv center allowing for a demonstration of cavity quantum electrodynamic effects even at room temperature .",
    "the phc consists of a triangular lattice of air holes with a pitch of @xmath0 and a hole radius of @xmath1 , that is milled in a free - standing single crystal diamond membrane with a thickness of @xmath2 .",
    "a nanocavity is formed by a linear one- or seven - hole defect in the photonic lattice , labeled m1- or m7-cavity , respectively .",
    "the single crystal diamond slab ( orientation of the top face is ( 001 ) ) is grown by chemical vapor deposition on a silicon substrate with iridium / yttria - stabilized zirconia buffer layers @xcite .",
    "the diamond growth parameters are adjusted such that a small amount of silicon is incorporated in the diamond yielding on average 2 single sivs/ in the final membrane . to obtain a free - standing membrane ,",

    "[ fig : position](d , e ) ) , we can estimate the positioning accuracy to be as small as one lattice constant .",
    "whereas in figure [ fig : position](d ) the emitter is displaced from the cavity center but still residing in the photonic lattice , the emitter of figure [ fig : position](e ) is perfectly located in the central cavity region .",
    "the positioning accuracy is mainly limited by the resolution ( ) of the fluorescence scans .    for application of the cavity alignment technique with respect to a pre - characterized emitter , it is crucial , that its spectral position , linewidth and dipole orientation are persistent upon fabrication .",

    "the deviation of the zpl wavelengths from the standard value of @xmath7 is due to strain in the sample blue - shifting the zpl @xcite .",
    "the zpl wavelength shift upon fabrication can be attributed to a local relaxation of the crystal strain due to the air hole patterning .",
