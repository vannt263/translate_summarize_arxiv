    "the performance of an emc site is usually validated either with experimental approaches , like @xcite , and numerical approaches , like @xcite .",
    "both approaches are of great importance and subject of current research ; moreover they are not exclusive but complementary , because each one can confirm the validity of the other . on",
    "the numerical side , simulation of anechoic chambers is a very attractive topic since it can provide useful data about the performance of an emc site in short times and with reduced costs .",
    "however mathematical properties of the underlying problem , combined with the huge physical dimensions of the typical sites , make its numerical solution very challenging .    in this work , we describe a novel approach for the numerical simulation of entire anechoich chambers in the frequency domain . instead of describing the geometry using a mesh with all the geometric details , we use equivalent models for the cone - ferrite assemblies and for radiating elements .",
    "this allows us to considerably reduce the number of mesh elements , and thus the computational resources required for the simulation , without degrading the accuracy of the results .",
    "in particular , our method allowed to simulate 558 different configurations of antenna positions and frequencies in a very short time on a common dual - xeon workstation .    to validate the presented method ,",
    "an experiment was devised : we set up a transmitter attached to a dipole inside a semi - anechoic chamber , with a measuring antenna three meters away .",
    "we then simulated the same setup with our methodology and compared the numerical results with the real field measurements .    in the following sections we first describe the experimental setup and then we set an _ uncertainty budget _ on the measurements .",
    "then the numerical part is presented : a brief introduction to the _ discrete geometric approach ( dga ) _ , the numerical method employed to solve the frequency domain wave propagation problem , is given .",
    "the technique of substituting complex radiating elements with equivalent ones , which we will refer to as _ equivalent radiator method _ ,",
    "is then presented ; theoretical aspects are discussed together with the applicability conditions of the technique . in a subsequent section ,",
    "an equivalent dipole is validated by comparing the simulation with the field computed from the closed - form expression of a dipole .",
    "finally , the modelling of the entire anechoic chamber is presented together with the comparison between the numerical results and the measurements .",
    "our experiment consisted in the measurement of the electric field produced by a rf radiator placed inside an anechoic chamber .",
    "the transmitter consisted in a comb generator connected to a specifically designed dipole . on the receiver side ,",
    "a biconic antenna was attached to an emi receiver ( fig .",
    "[ fig : setup1 ] ) . transmitting and receiving antennae",
    "were placed at prescribed positions .",
    "field measurements were made with transmitting and receiving antennas placed at heights of 1 , 1.5 and 2 meters both in horizontal and vertical polarization , at a distance of three meters .",
    "this gave us a total of @xmath0 different measurement setups .",
    "measurements consisted in sweeps from 90 to 390 mhz at steps of 10 mhz .",
    "the two frequency limits were chosen mostly for practical reasons .",
    "in particular , the antennae employed in the experiments can not perform well outside that range . on the other hand , the chosen range allowed to use the same mesh for all the frequencies .      the measurements involved a number of instruments , in particular :    * comb generator * hewlett - packard 8591em spectrum analyzer * agilent 9038a emi receiver * ad - hoc transmitting dipole * schwarzbeck ubaa9114 biconical antenna * hewlett - packard 8753e vector network analyzer ( vna )    the performance of all instruments was perfectly known , except for the comb generator and the trasmitting dipole , which required careful characterization ( summarized in fig .",

    "the comb generator is a specifically designed , battery - powered instrument capable to generate harmonics from 10 mhz to well above 1 ghz in steps of 10 mhz .",
    "its power spectrum was measured to obtain , for each harmonic , the amount of _ forward power _",
    "@xmath1 supplied to the transmitting dipole . with the aid of a directional coupler",
    ", it was determined that the power spectrum of the comb generator changed by negligible amounts when changing its load . moreover , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : characterization ] , the comb generator shows slightly different power levels for even and odd harmonics .",
    "the characterization of the transmitting antenna was a central topic of the proposed scheme .",
    "the complex impedance @xmath2 of the transmitting dipole was measured with the aid of the vna .",
    "the impedance measurement was made for all the six antenna positions ( three heights and two polarizations ) . from the impedance ,",
    "return loss @xmath3 was computed and used to calculate the _ reverse power _",
    "@xmath4 flowing from the antenna back to the comb generator because of the mismatch . as a cross - check ,",
    "the dipole was simulated with nec2 code , which confirmed the measurements .",
    "the indirect measurement of @xmath4 subsequently allowed to compute the _ net power _",
    "@xmath5 with a good accuracy , despite of the heavy mismatch between the generator and the antenna . finally , using @xmath5 and the antenna impedance the supply current at the feedpoint of the dipole",
