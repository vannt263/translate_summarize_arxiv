    "non - abelian anyons exhibit exotic physics that would make them an ideal basis for topological quantum computation @xcite .",
    "it has recently become apparent that truly scalable quantum computation with non - abelian anyons can only be achieved when invoking active error correction , despite the protection provided by a finite anyon gap @xcite .",
    "the development of practical systems in which non - abelian anyons may be created , manipulated , and detected is therefore highly important .",
    "systems in which non - abelian anyons arise typically suffer from one of two drawbacks : either they are experimentally extremely challenging to realize ( as is the case for quantum double @xcite or string - net models @xcite ) , or it is not clear how they can be made compatible with the active error correction required for fault - tolerance ( as is the case for fqh systems ) .",
    "a particularly attractive approach for building a fault - tolerant quantum computer is to use a system of physical qubits ( spin-@xmath3 particles ) .",
    "a number of technologies allow for precise qubit control , such as superconducting qubits @xcite , trapped atomic ions @xcite , spin qubits @xcite , or cold atoms or polar molecules in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "a qubit lattice with two - body nearest neighbour interactions would therefore be an ideal system to realize non - abelian anyons .",
    "while the model we propose involves three - body interactions , we discuss how these can be obtained from two - body interactions .",
    "non - abelian anyons supported by a qubit system typically are majorana zero modes , also known as ising anyons @xcite .",
    "a variety of proposals for experimental realization of majorana zero modes in solid state systems have also been developed @xcite .",
    "these anyons can be used to perform universal quantum computation when enhanced by non - topological operations @xcite . however , these additional operations are highly resource intensive .",
    "anyon models with a richer set of topological operations would therefore be much more practical for the realization of topological quantum computation .",
    "here we solve this by introducing a model composed of two - qubit hamiltonian interactions that can realize a more complex model of non - abelian anyons , known as @xmath4 parafermions .",
    "the error correction problem for these is studied in detail .",
    "parafermion modes are generalizations of majoranas whose fusion and braiding behavior is more complex and computationally more powerful .",

    "these anyons are majorana zero - modes for @xmath6 and more powerful parafermions for @xmath7 .",
    "unfortunately , the generalized pauli operators appearing in the @xmath5 quantum double models models coincide with the physically relevant spin - operators only for @xmath6 .",
    "otherwise , their structure makes them highly difficult to realize experimentally .",
    "the case @xmath2 , however , allows us to combine the best of both worlds .",
    "the joint hilbert space of two qubits allows the @xmath8-dimensional generalized pauli operators to be expressed in terms of two - qubit operators . using this ,",
    "we show how @xmath4 parafermions can emerge in a lattice of qubits with nearest - neighbor interactions only .",
    "this allows the computational power of @xmath4 parafermions to be harnessed in a qubit system .",
    "the fact that our system is built on top of a system supporting abelian anyons ( the @xmath9 quantum double model ) proves very useful .",
    "the non - abelian parafermion modes can not only be braided with each other , but also with abelian excitations of the quantum double model , allowing us to generate the entire clifford group for @xmath2 by quasi - particle braiding .",
    "this extends beyond the limited set of gates found using the same parafermions in previous work @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we do not have to perform non - abelian error correction ( a still poorly understood problem @xcite ) to guarantee fault - tolerance , but can correct the underlying abelian model .",

    "to consider the creation and braiding of unpaired parafermionic modes , we must first decide on the double plaquettes with which we will work .",

    "relevant examples of the latter type are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : braid ] by red , orange and green lines connecting the corresponding modes .    , the parafermion to the right is labelled @xmath72 , and that to the left is @xmath73 . ]    for the two modes within each double plaquette , the parity operator @xmath75 corresponds to the stabilizer @xmath76 .",
    "the orange and red lines connecting modes @xmath73 to @xmath77 denote the parity operators @xmath78 . for orange lines ,",
    "these correspond to the operator @xmath31 on the vertex through which the line passes . for red lines they correspond to the operator @xmath79 .",
    "consider a state initially within the stabilizer space .",
    "the parity operators for the pairs of parafermion modes within each double plaquette are therefore part of the stabilizer .",
    "the state therefore corresponds to this definite pairing of the modes .",
    "let us now consider the removal of the operator @xmath80 from the set of stabilizer generators ( while @xmath81 remains ) .",
    "the corresponding parafermion modes are now , in some sense , unpaired .",
    "this contributes a factor of four to the ground space degeneracy @xcite .",
    "however , due to the fact that the ` unpaired ' parafermions are not well separated , it is not difficult for local perturbations to lift the degeneracy of this space . to become truly unpaired , and benefit from topological protection , they must be separated .    to do this",
    ", we can add a term @xmath82 to the hamiltonian , which corresponds to the parity operator @xmath83 .",
    "this acts on the vertex through which the orange line connecting these modes passes .    for @xmath84",
    ", this new term will overwhelm the @xmath85 term",
    ". the pairing of @xmath86 and @xmath87 will then be broken , and @xmath86 will become paired with @xmath88 instead .",
    "the unpaired mode originally at @xmath88 is therefore effectively moved to @xmath87 .",
    "if the new term is introduced adiabatically , the degenerate subspace associated with the unpaired parafermion modes will remain in the same state during this process .",
    "similar processes can be used to move the unpaired modes further .",
    "the hamiltonian term @xmath89 corresponding to @xmath90 can then be used to move the parafermion at @xmath87 to @xmath91 , for example .",
    "unpaired parafermion modes can therefore be separated by arbitrary distances , at the endpoints of lines on which single qudit terms are added to the hamiltonian . in terms of qubits , these correspond to two - body interactions between qubits in the same site .    in order to unlock the potential of parafermions for quantum computation",
    ", it must be possible to braid the parafermion modes .",
    "let us consider a specific example of this , using the system of fig .",
    "[ fig : braid ] .",
    "consider an initial state within the stabilizer space of all @xmath76 except @xmath92 and @xmath93 . at these two points",
    ", we have the unpaired parafermion modes @xmath94 , @xmath88 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "let us now consider operations such as those described above to move @xmath94 and @xmath96 away , beyond the bottom of the figure .",
    "all four parafermion modes are then well separated , and so the ground state degeneracy is topological protected .",
    "we will now consider the exchange of @xmath88 with @xmath95 .",
    "we do this by first moving @xmath88 to @xmath97 , then @xmath95 to @xmath88 , and finally @xmath97 to @xmath95 .",
    "the two modes have then swapped places .",
    "an exchange of opposite chirality would correspond to first moving @xmath95 to @xmath98 , and so on .",
    "note that all modes are kept well separated during the exchange , and so topological protection is always maintained .    during the exchange , the movement of the modes",
    "is mostly achieved using hamiltonian terms that correspond to the red and orange pairings in fig .",
    "[ fig : braid ] .",
    "these are all single qudit terms . at the junction ,",
    "however , terms corresponding to the green pairings are used .",
    "we must therefore consider these in detail .",
    "for the pairing show by the light green line , the parity operator is @xmath99 .",
    "this has the effect of creating an @xmath100 , @xmath101 pair on the double plaquettes @xmath102 and @xmath71 .",
    "this requires the two qudit operator @xmath103 . for the dark green pairing",
    ", the @xmath104 parity operator similarly requires the three qudit operator @xmath105 .",
    "these terms correspond to four- and six - body quasi - local interactions on the corresponding qubits , respectively .",
    "they can be realized by standard methods of perturbative gadgets .",
    "however , note that they need only be implemented while an exchange is in progress .",
    "to determine the effects of a single clockwise exchange we consider the smallest possible implementation .",
    "this involves the double plaquettes labelled @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath71 in fig .",
    "[ fig : braid ] , which are shown in more detail in fig .",
    "[ fig : braid2 ] .",
    "we consider a state in which the modes at @xmath72 and @xmath108 are unpaired , and those at @xmath109 and @xmath110 are paired by the hamiltonian term @xmath111 . using this , we determine the effects of exchanging the unpaired modes .",
    "the method used to exchange the two modes is similar to previous methods proposed in order to perform anyon braiding @xcite .",
    "the results of the exchange are most easily understood in terms of the @xmath74 mode formed by this pair .",
    "the parity operator , @xmath112 for this mode is an operator that creates a @xmath113 , @xmath114 pair and places them in double plaquettes @xmath71 and @xmath106 , respectively .",
    "also it must have eigenvalues of the form @xmath115 , and so @xmath116 .",
    "these conditions are satisfied by @xmath117 we similarly require operations that can move parafermions between the relevant plaquettes . these correspond to the green line between @xmath107 and @xmath71 and the red line between @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "these are @xmath118 respectively . in these relations",
    "@xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are all elements of @xmath0 .",
    "we have freedom in choosing the values @xmath119 for these relations .",
    "the corresponding freedom also exists for all operators used to move parafermion modes , as well as the logical operators .",
    "the values used do not simply correspond to differences in a global phase .",
    "instead they determine which eigenspace of these operators has eigenvalue @xmath120 , and so which one corresponds to the vacuum occupancy @xmath121 of the @xmath74 mode .",
    "these phases therefore can not be chosen entirely arbitrarily , since the overall conservation constraint of @xmath74 modes must be maintained . however , since here we do not explicitly consider the operations that placed unpaired parafermion modes at @xmath72 and @xmath108 , we can assume that their phases are chosen in a way that maintains this conservation .",
    "we will therefore consider a free choice of @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .    the first step in exchanging the parafermions is to move the one at @xmath72 to @xmath110 .",
    "this is done by adiabatically changing the hamitonian to one in which the term @xmath122 is present and stronger than @xmath111 .",
    "this causes the modes at @xmath109 and @xmath72 to pair , moving the mode once at @xmath72 to @xmath110 .",
    "the mode at @xmath108 is then moved to that at @xmath72 by adiabatically changing the hamitonian to one in which the @xmath123 term is present and stronger than @xmath111 , and the @xmath122 term is removed , pairing @xmath108 with @xmath109 .",
    "the mode at @xmath110 is then moved to @xmath108 by adiabatically removing the @xmath122 term and so allowing @xmath111 to become dominant and @xmath109 and @xmath110 to pair .",
    "this process then results in the clockwise exchange of the modes .",
    "the first step of this transformation takes a state that is initially in the @xmath124 eigenspace of @xmath111 and projects it to one in the @xmath124 eigenspace of @xmath125 .",
    "the next step projects the state into the @xmath124 eigenspace of @xmath126 .",
    "the final step projects back into the @xmath124 eigenspace of @xmath111 .",
    "the end effect is then @xmath127 here @xmath128 is the projector onto the @xmath124 eigenspace of @xmath111 , etc .",
    "the rightmost @xmath128 simply reflects the fact that the initial state lies within this eigenspace .",
    "the parity operator @xmath112 for the pair of unpaired modes commutes with @xmath111 , and so can be mutually diagonalized with the above operator .",
    "we can therefore interpret its effects in terms of the phase factor assigned to each of the possible @xmath100 eigenspaces of the @xmath74 mode of the pair .",
    "when doing this , different values of @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 will result in different operations .",
    "this may seem to contradict the standard notion of a topological protected operation .",
    "however , these differences can be most easily understood by considering movement of parafermion modes implemented by measurement rather than adiabatic hamiltonian manipulation .",
    "this method forces pairing of parafermion modes by measuring the occupancy of their corresponding @xmath74 mode , and so forcing it to have a definite value .",
    "ideally , this measurement will give the vacuum result @xmath121 .",
    "the effect is then the same as the adiabatic manipulation .",
    "if a different @xmath100 results , it must be removed by fusing it with the unpaired parafermion mode being moved .",
    "the different values used for the phases when moving unpaired modes , such as @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 here , determine how the measurement results are interpreted in terms of @xmath74 anyons , and so determine the net @xmath100 fused with the modes being moved .",
    "as such , differences in the conventions used for an exchange will change the resulting operation only by a factor of @xmath129 , for some value of @xmath130 that depends on @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .    for the standard convention used throughout this paper , with @xmath131 ,",
    "the phase assigned to a @xmath100 occupation by the exchange is @xmath132 .",
    "these are indeed all square roots of @xmath133 , as predicted in the main text",
    ". however , they are not of the elegant form @xmath134 that would be more conducive for the proofs of appendix [ app : clifford ] .    for an exchange operation that does have the required form , consider @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "the phase assigned to @xmath100 is @xmath137 in this case , up to a global phase of @xmath138 .",
    "the required phases @xmath134 would therefore be obtained from an anticlockwise exchange .",
    "the fact that we obtain the phase @xmath137 for a clockwise exchange in this case means we would get @xmath139 for a full clockwise monodromy .",
    "this would seem to contradict the arguments of the main text , which predict a phase of @xmath133 .",
    "however , note that these phases differ only by a factor of @xmath140 , and so are equivalent up to a factor of @xmath141 .",
    "since such factors are to be expected for different choices of @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , this monodromy does not contradict our expectations .",
    "the ambiguity in these phases reflects the fact that the anyon model described by the fusion rules in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fusion_rules ] ) obeys only projective non - abelian statistics .",
    "note that the arguments above do not assume anything about the initial state of the exchanged parafermions . only their initial positions and the operations used to move them are required .",
    "the effect of the braiding is expressed in terms of @xmath112 , the parity operator for their shared @xmath74 mode , which can be defined for any pair of parafermions .",
    "it therefore does not matter what state the fusion space of the parafermions was initially in , and it does not matter whether or not they exist at the end of the same defect line .",
    "the effect of the braiding is the same in all cases .",
    "for a tensor product of @xmath142 @xmath11-level systems @xmath143 , the pauli group @xmath144 is defined as the group generated by the generalized pauli operators @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and the clifford group @xmath145 is defined as the normalizer of @xmath144 in the unitary group on @xmath143 .",
    "that is , elements in @xmath145 map tensor products of @xmath11-level pauli operators to other such tensor products under conjugation .",
    "we start with some general remarks on the action of @xmath146 on @xmath147 for @xmath2 . for @xmath2 , an operator @xmath148 has eigenvalues @xmath149 if @xmath150 , @xmath151 if both @xmath39 and @xmath40 are even and at least one of them is non - zero , @xmath152 if both @xmath39 and @xmath40 are odd , and @xmath153 if @xmath154 is odd . since the number of distinct eigenvalues is preserved under conjugation , this implies that the pauli group @xmath147 decays into distinct orbits when @xmath146 acts on it by conjugation .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the case where @xmath11 is an odd prime , which is studied in ref .",

    "the logical @xmath13 of the logical qubit corresponds exactly to the operator @xmath308 , and @xmath316 corresponds to @xmath317 .",
    "since these are three - body operators , this type of logical error requires action on only three qubit pairs .",
    "the stored qudit is therefore clearly not topologically protected against @xmath13 type errors .      to enlarge @xmath310 ,",
    "consider a neighbouring triangular plaquette @xmath318 .",

    "it will also be an @xmath115 eigenstate of @xmath319 , since the state is a @xmath320 eigenstate of the stabilizer @xmath321 .",
    "consider the adiabatic introduction of the term @xmath322 to the hamiltonian .",
    "this term should be much stronger than the adjacent plaquette operators , and so will effectively force @xmath250 into an eigenstate of @xmath12 and remove it from the code .",
    "since this term does not commute with @xmath308 or @xmath321 , the resulting state will not be an eigenstate of these operators .",

    "it therefore remains the same @xmath115 eigenstate as it was for the initial state .",
    "the qudit state @xmath312 has therefore been effectively transferred from the single plaquette @xmath310 to the combined plaquette @xmath323 .",
    "the operator @xmath319 becomes the logical @xmath13 , and has support on four qubit pairs rather than three .",

    "doing this adiabatically will result in a final state with the @xmath308 term in its ground state , which is its @xmath320 eigenspace . due to conservation of anyon charge",
    ", the @xmath313 anyon that was held in the larger hole must still be held in the smaller hole .",
    "the qudit state therefore remains @xmath312 .    as well as this being true for each basis state @xmath312 , we must also be sure that the process preserves coherent superpositions .",
    "any process that causes decoherence in this basis will correspond to measurement ( by the environment ) in the @xmath13 basis .",
    "any unitary that introduces unwanted relative phases can be expressed as a sum of powers of @xmath13 . as such",
    ", these processes must have support on all sites on which @xmath13 has support , which are all sites around the hole .",
    "since the shrinking ( and expansion ) of holes does not have such support , it can not cause any decoherence .",
    "corresponding processes can also be applied to hexagonal plaquettes . in that case",
    ", a logical qudit can be stored in the @xmath329 occupations of plaquettes .",
    "such qudits can be topologically protected by using lines of @xmath330 terms to combine neighbouring horizontal plaquettes .",
    "using the processes of extending and shrinking holes , it is possible to move them .",
    "gates can then be implemented through braiding .",
    "braiding an @xmath315-type hole of triangular plaquettes in state @xmath312 around an @xmath331-type hole of hexagonal ones in state @xmath332 corresponds to braiding the @xmath313 anyon held by the former around the @xmath333 of the latter , yielding a phase @xmath334 .",

    "the lines form a boundary along which one type of anyon can condense , but the other can not cross .",
    "it is this difference that gives the @xmath74-holes additional properties , namely the localized parafermion modes at their endpoints , that the @xmath315- and @xmath331-holes do not possess .",
    "the topological degeneracy and protection , however , is a property shared by all three .",
    "an @xmath315-type hole and an @xmath331-type hole together correspond to a two - qudit space .",
    "however , let us consider the subspace spanned by states @xmath336 .",
    "these are such that the @xmath315-type hole carries an @xmath313 anyon whenever the @xmath331-type hole carries an @xmath329 .",
    "a single qudit can be stored in this subspace    since @xmath337 , two holes as described above hold a net @xmath100 .",
    "similar fusion can also be applied to holes , as we will now show .",
    "specifically an @xmath315-type and an @xmath331-type hole can be combined into a @xmath74-type hole , and a @xmath74-type hole can be split into an @xmath315-type and @xmath331-type one .",
    "these processes are in fact a simple generalization of the hole extension and shrinking processes described above .",
    "suppose we have a defect line along double plaquettes @xmath71 , @xmath338 , @xmath339 , @xmath157 this stores a qudit whose basis states @xmath312 are @xmath115 eigenstates of @xmath340 let us now extend this line .",
    "however , rather than adding another double plaquette , we instead add a triangular plaquette @xmath310 .",
    "this can be done by adiabatically introducing the strong term @xmath324 to the hamiltonian on a site shared by @xmath310 and the triangular part of @xmath71 .",
    "this term does not commute with either @xmath308 or @xmath341 .",
    "however , it does commute with their product .",

    "these grow the @xmath315- and @xmath331-part of the defect line , respectively .",
    "once both the blue and green defect lines have been added , the red defect line can be removed .",
    "the @xmath100 particle initially stored in the red defect line has then been split into its @xmath313 and @xmath329 components . ]    when both @xmath315-type and @xmath331-type parts have been added , the original @xmath74-type defect line can be removed .",
    "this is done simply by removing the parity operator terms along its length and allowing the @xmath76 terms to again dominate .",
    "the end result is that the @xmath100 originally stored in the defect line now resides in the @xmath315-type hole as an @xmath313 and the @xmath331-type hole as an @xmath329 , corresponding to the state @xmath336 of their individual qudits . as for the shrinking of holes , this process does not have sufficient support to distinguish between different basis states .",
    "the process therefore does not decohere any superpositions of these states , nor does it assign any relative phases .    to recombine the two holes into a single defect line ,",
    "the process is simply reversed",
    ". this will be straightforward if the two holes are in a state of the form @xmath336 , since the state of the defect line will simply become @xmath312 .",
    "however some processes , such as mistakes during error correction , could result in holes whose states are not of this form .",
    "this will introduce frustration that will not allow all of the involved triangular and hexagonal plaquettes to return to their ground state after recombination .",
    "as an example , consider a state of the form @xmath345 .",
    "this corresponds to an @xmath313 and an @xmath346 , and could arise from an initial state @xmath336 if an @xmath347 were added in error to the @xmath331-type hole , or from @xmath348 with an @xmath349 error on the @xmath315-type hole .",
