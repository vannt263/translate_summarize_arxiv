    "in developing the standard model for particles , certain types of interactions and decays are observed to be common and others seem to be forbidden .",
    "the study of interactions has led to a number of conservation laws which govern them @xcite .",
    "these conservation laws are in addition to the classical conservation laws such as conservation of energy , charge , etc . , which still apply in the realm of particle interactions .",
    "specific quantum numbers have been assigned to the different fundamental particles , and other conservation laws are associated with those quantum numbers . from another point of view , it would seem that any localized particle of finite mass should be unstable , since the decay into several smaller particles provides many more ways to distribute the energy , and thus would have higher entropy .",
    "this idea is even stated as a principle called the  \" totalitarian principle  \" which might be stated as  \" every process that is not forbidden must occur  \" . from this point of view ,",
    "any decay process which is expected but not observed must be prevented from occurring by some conservation law .",
    "this approach has been fruitful in helping to determine the rules for particle decay .",
    "conservation laws for parity , isospin , and strangeness have been developed by detailed observation of particle interactions @xcite .",
    "the implications of parity symmetry in atoms were first investigated by wigner @xcite , who demonstrated that the combination of charge conjugation @xmath6 , parity @xmath7 and time reversal @xmath8 is considered to be a fundamental symmetry operation - all physical particles and interactions appear to be invariant under this combination .",
    "called @xmath9 invariance , this symmetry plumbs the depths of our understanding of nature .",
    "many of the researchers already described the behavior of these symmetries in electromagnetic fields @xcite . in a series of papers @xcite",
    ", we have discussed the generalized dirac - maxwell ( gdm ) equations in presence of electric and magnetic sources in an isotropic ( homogeneous ) medium .",
    "we have also analyzed the other quantum equations of dyons in consistent and manifest covariant way @xcite .",
    "this theory has been shown to remain invariant under the duality transformations in isotropic homogeneous medium .",
    "quaternion analysis of time dependent maxwells equations has been developed @xcite in presence of electric and magnetic charges and the solution for the classical problem of moving charge ( electric and magnetic ) are obtained consistently .",
    "the time dependent generalized dirac - maxwells ( gdm ) equations of dyons have also been discussed @xcite in chiral and inhomogeneous media and the solutions for the classical problem are obtained .",
    "the quaternion reformulation of generalized electromagnetic fields of dyons in chiral and inhomogeneous media has also been analyzed @xcite .",
    "we have also discussed @xcite the monochromatic fields of generalized electromagnetic fields of dyons in slowly changing media in a consistent manner . in this paper , we have made an attempt to study the different symmetric properties of generalized maxwell s dirac equations in the homogeneous medium .",
    "it is shown that the generalized maxwell s - dirac ( gdm ) equations are invariant under discrete symmetries like parity @xmath0 , time reversal @xmath1 , charge conjugation @xmath6 , parity - time reversal operation @xmath3 , charge conjugation - parity operation @xmath4 and combined operation @xmath10 .",
    "but when we take the compact form of these equations as complex ones for generalized fields of dyons , we observe that field equation and equation of motion of dyons are no more invariant under @xmath0 symmetry , @xmath1 transformations and combined effects of @xmath4 and @xmath3 . on the other hand ,",
    "these equations and other quantum equations of dyons in homogeneous medium are invariant under the combined operation @xmath10 . as such",
    ", we may conclude that @xmath9 invariance is an exact symmetry for generalized fields of dyons and reproduces the consistent theory of electric charge ( magnetic monopole ) in the absence magnetic monopole ( electric charge ) on dyons .",
    "assuming the existence of magnetic monopoles , dirac @xcite generalized the maxwell s equations in homogeneous isotropic medium written in the following manner in si units @xmath11 i. e.    @xmath12    where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are respectively the electric and magnetic charge densities while @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the corresponding current densities , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are defined respectively as relative permittivity and permeability in electric and magnetic fields in the medium , @xmath19 is electric field , @xmath20 is magnetic field and @xmath21 is the velocity of the electromagnetic wave .",
    "differential equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) are the generalized field equation of dyon in homogeneous medium and the corresponding electric and magnetic fields are called the generalized electromagnetic fields of dyons .",
    "these electromagnetic fields of dyons are expressed in following differential form in homogeneous medium in terms of two four potentials as @xcite ,    @xmath22    where @xmath23=@xmath24 and @xmath25=@xmath26 are the two four - potentials respectively associated with electric and magnetic charges .",
    "let us define the complex vector field @xmath27 in the following form ,    @xmath28    equations ( [ eq:1],[eq:2 ] ) and ( [ eq:3 ] ) , thus give rise to the following relation between generalized field and the components of the generalized four - potential as ;    @xmath29    here @xmath30 is the generalized four - potential of dyons in homogeneous medium and defined as ;    @xmath31    where    @xmath32    and    @xmath33    using equations ( [ eq:3],[eq:4],[eq:5],[eq:6 ] ) , dirac - maxwell field equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) may be written in terms of generalized field @xmath34 as ;    @xmath35    where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are respectively the generalized charge and current source densities of dyons in homogeneous medium @xcite given by ;    @xmath38    with the use of equations ( [ eq:8 ] ) and ( [ eq:9 ] ) , we introduce a new parameter @xmath39 ( i.e. the field current ) as    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the dalembertian operator expressed as    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the speed of electromagnetic wave in homogeneous isotropic medium . in terms of complex potential , the field equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) is written as    @xmath44    hence , we may write the tensorial form of generalized maxwell dirac equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) of dyons in isotropic homogeneous medium as ,    @xmath45    where    @xmath46    defining the generalized field tensor of dyons @xcite as ;    @xmath47    one can directly obtain the following form of generalized field equation of dyon in homogeneous isotropic medium as    @xmath48    where @xmath49 the lorentz four - force equation of motion for dyon in homogeneous isotropic medium is written as ;    @xmath50    where @xmath51 denotes the real part , @xmath52 is the four - acceleration and @xmath53 is the four - velocity of the particle and @xmath54 is the generalized charge of dyon in homogeneous isotropic medium .",
    "parity is the symmetry of interaction which involves a transformation that changes the algebraic sign of the coordinate system @xcite . under the parity transformation @xmath0 ;    @xmath55    the parity transformation changes a right - handed coordinate system into a left - handed one or vice versa . under the parity transformations the physical quantities like time @xmath56 , mass @xmath57 , electric charge density @xmath58 , magnetic current density @xmath59 , electric scalar potential @xmath60 , magnetic vector potential @xmath61 , generalized scalar potential @xmath62 , time derivative @xmath63 , d alembertian @xmath64 and magnetic field @xmath65 , have even parity as they do not change @xcite their sign under spatial inversion ( parity transformation ) showing that they have even parity .",
    "@xmath66    on the other hand , the physical like displacement @xmath67 , velocity @xmath68 , acceleration @xmath69 , magnetic charge density @xmath70 , electric current density @xmath71 , magnetic scalar potential @xmath72 , differential operator @xmath73 , electric vector potential @xmath74 and electric field @xmath75 have odd parity as they change @xcite their sign under spatial inversion ( parity transformation ) i.e.    @xmath76    showing that due to change of sign , these quantity have odd parity . now applying the parity transformations to equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) , we find that the generalized dirac - maxwell s equations ( [ eq:1 ] ) are invariant under parity transformations . on applying the parity transformation to equations ( [ eq:4 ] , [ eq:6 ] , [ eq:7 ] , [ eq:9 ] , [ eq:10 ] ) , we get    @xmath77    as such , the components of generalized complex potential given by equations ( [ eq:12 ] ) are invariant under parity transformations .",
    "the tensorial form of generalized maxwell dirac equation of dyons in isotropic homogeneous medium given by equations ( [ eq:13 ] ) are also invariant under parity transformations . on the other hand , the generalized field equations ( [ eq:16 ] ) and the lorentz four - force equation of motion ( [ eq:18 ] ) for generalized fields of dyon in homogeneous isotropic medium loose their invariance under parity transformations .",
    "in simple classical terms , time reversal just means replacing @xmath78 by @xmath79 , inverting the direction of the flow of time @xcite . reversing time also reverses the time derivatives of spatial quantities .",
    "so , it reverses momentum and angular momentum .",
    "thus the following physical quantities like displacement ( @xmath80 ) , acceleration ( @xmath81 ) , electric charge source density ( @xmath13 ) , magnetic current source density ( @xmath16 ) , electric scalar potential ( @xmath82 ) , magnetic vector potential ( @xmath83 ) , space derivative ( @xmath84 ) and generalized electric field ( @xmath85 ) are unaffected and do not change @xcite their sign under time reversal i.e.@xmath86 on the other hand the physical quantities like time ( @xmath78 ) , particle velocity ( @xmath87),electric current source density ( @xmath15 ) , magnetic scalar potential ( @xmath88 ) , electric vector potential ( @xmath89 ) , time derivative ( @xmath90 ) and generalized magnetic field ( @xmath91 ) are affected and change their sign under time reversal i.e ..    @xmath92    applying the time reversal ( @xmath1 ) symmetry to equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) , we find that the generalized dirac - maxwell equations ( [ eq:1 ] ) in the homogeneous medium are invariant under @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "similarly , on applying @xmath1 symmetry to equations ( [ eq:4],[eq:6],[eq:7 ] , [ eq:8],[eq:10 ] ) , we get    @xmath93    thus , the components of generalized complex potential defined by equation ( [ eq:12 ] ) are invariant under @xmath1 symmetry . as such , the tensorial forms of generalized dirac- maxwell equation of dyons in isotropic homogeneous medium given by equation ( [ eq:13 ] ) remain invariant under the time reversal @xmath8 symmetry while the generalized equations ( [ eq:16 ] ) and ( [ eq:18 ] ) describe respectively the field equation and lorentz force equation of motion for dyons are not invariant under @xmath1 symmetry like parity .",
    "classically , charge conjugation ( charge symmetry ) replaces positive charges by negative charges and vice versa @xcite .",
    "since electric and magnetic fields have their origins in charges , one can reverse these fields on the application of charge conjugation .",
    "charge conjugation also involves reversing all the internal quantum numbers like lepton number , baryon number and strangeness etc .",
    "the physical quantities like displacement ( @xmath80 ) , time ( @xmath78 ) , mass ( @xmath94 ) , particle velocity ( @xmath95 ) , acceleration ( @xmath81 ) , space derivative ( @xmath84 ) and time derivative ( @xmath90 ) are invariant under charge conjugation @xcite while the energy , momentum or spin are unaffected i.e.    @xmath96    on the other hand the physical quantities like electric charge ( @xmath97 ) , magnetic charge ( @xmath98 ) , electric charge source density ( @xmath13 ) , magnetic charge source density ( @xmath14 ) , generalized charge source density ( @xmath36 ) , electric scalar potential @xmath60 , magnetic scalar potential @xmath72 , generalized scalar potential @xmath62,electric current source density ( @xmath15 ) , magnetic current source density ( @xmath16 ) , generalized current source density ( @xmath99 ) , electric vector potential ( @xmath89 ) , magnetic vector potential @xmath61 , generalized vector potential @xmath100 , generalized electric field ( @xmath85 ) and generalized magnetic field ( @xmath91 ) are directly related to the charge and thus their sign is changed under charge symmetry as,@xmath101 if we check the @xmath2 invariance of equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) , we find that the generalized dirac - maxwell s equations ( [ eq:1 ] ) of dyons in the homogeneous medium are invariant under charge symmetry .",
    "similarly if we apply the @xmath2 invariance conditions to equations ( [ eq:4 ] ) and ( [ eq:10 ] ) , we see that the physical quantities like generalized field @xmath102 and generalized field current @xmath103 of dyon in homogeneous medium change their sign as ,    @xmath104    applying the @xmath2 transformation to , the complex potential equations ( [ eq:12 ] ) , the tensorial form of dirac - maxwell equations ( [ eq:13 ] ) , generalized field equation ( [ eq:16 ] ) and lorentz force equation ( [ eq:18 ] ) of dyons in isotropic homogeneous medium , we see that these equations of dyons in homogeneous isotropic medium are invariant under @xmath2 transformations .",
    "the most widely known symmetry are based on group theory is called @xmath3 symmetry . in case of @xmath3 symmetry , the particle velocity , potential and current are invariant under the simultaneous action of the space and time reflection operators @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite i.e.    @xmath106    where the symbols of physical quantities have their usual meaning as discussed above . on the other hand , the following physical variables with their usual symbols @xmath107",
    "get changed their sign under @xmath3 symmetry . simultaneously ,",
    "if we perform the @xmath3 symmetry operation to the equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) , we find that the generalized dirac - maxwell s equations of dyon in the homogeneous medium are invariant under @xmath3 symmetry . applying the @xmath3 symmetry to generalized field @xmath102 and generalized field current @xmath103 of dyons in homogeneous medium respectively given by equations ( [ eq:4 ] ) and ( [ eq:10 ] )",
    ", we see that these quantities change their sign under @xmath3 symmetry i.e.    @xmath108    while the dyon field equations ( [ eq:1 ] , [ eq:8 ] , and [ eq:12 ] ) are invariant under @xmath3 symmetry .",
    "the combined operation of @xmath3 transformation also shows the invariance of the tensorial forms of maxwell s equations ( [ eq:13 ] ) and the generalized field equation ( [ eq:16 ] ) of dyons in homogeneous isotropic medium . on the other hand , the lorentz four - force equation ( [ eq:18 ] ) of motion for dyon in homogeneous isotropic medium looses its invariance under @xmath3 symmetry and thus gets changed its sign under this symmetry",
    "associated with the conservation laws which govern the behavior of physical particles , charge conjugation @xmath6 and parity @xmath7 combine to constitute a fundamental symmetry called @xmath4 invariance @xcite .",
    "the following quantities are invariant under the combined effect of @xmath4 i.e.    @xmath109    on the other hand , we see that the following parameters change their sign under the combined operation @xmath4 of charge conjugation and parity i.e.    @xmath110    applying symmetry operation @xmath4 to equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) , we see that the generalized maxwell s equation in the homogeneous medium ( [ eq:1 ] ) are invariant under @xmath4 symmetry .",

    "examples in nature can be cited for the violation of each of these symmetries individually .",
    "it was thought for a time that @xmath4 ( parity transformation plus charge conjugation ) would always leave a system invariant , but the notable example of the neutral kaons has shown a slight violation of @xmath4 symmetry .",
