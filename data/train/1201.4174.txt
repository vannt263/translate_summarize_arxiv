    "<S> symmetries play an essential role almost everywhere in physics . </S>",
    "<S> a prominent example is landau s theory of phases : different phases are classified by whether the state of the system obeys or breaks the symmetries of the hamiltonian . in turn , this gives rise to local order parameters which can be measured to determine which phase a system is in . </S>",
    "<S> this picture has recently been challenged by the discovery of topologically ordered phases : they are not associated to the breaking of any local symmetry , and therefore there is no local order parameter which can be used to detect topological phases .    </S>",
    "<S> topological order occurs only in two and higher dimensions , since one - dimensional gapped spin systems exhibit only a single phase . </S>",
    "<S> however , the situation in one dimension changes if we impose symmetries  they do not only give rise to landau - type phases which are distinguished by local order parameters , but also to distinct _ symmetry - protected phases _ which can not be distinguished by any local order parameter ( and might thus be called _ topological _ ) , yet which are protected ( i.e. , separated ) by the presence of the symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the most prominent example for a non - trivial symmetry protected phase is the haldane phase , which contains the spin-@xmath1 aklt model and likely the spin-@xmath1 heisenberg model and which is e.g.  protected by @xmath0 symmetry  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , it has been realized that these phases differ by the way in which the symmetry acts _ across _ blocks of the system , i.e. , on the entanglement between blocks . </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood in a particularly natural way in the framework of matrix product states ( mps ) , which provide the appropriate framework for the description of gapped one - dimensional systems , and which allow to directly access the entanglement between blocks  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it has been found that the action of the symmetry on the entanglement between blocks , and thus the different symmetry protected phases , are distinguished by the inequivalent projective representations of the symmetry group , such as integer and half - integer spin representations in the case of the rotation group  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> symmetry protected phases such as the spin-@xmath1 aklt chain do not exhibit long - range order , this is , non - decaying correlations between distant sites , which could otherwise replace local order parameters . </S>",
    "<S> however , they do exhibit what is known as string order  @xcite : measuring a string of identical operators with distinct endpoints gives correlations which do not depend on the length of the string , despite the absence of conventional long - range order . </S>",
    "<S> this might suggest that string order parameters can be used to distinguish different symmetry - protected phases . </S>",
    "<S> however , the presence of string order is rather a signature of the symmetry itself than of the phase of the system under that symmetry , and string order parameters need to be tailored to the system under consideration ; indeed , one can easily find examples of systems in different phases which are susceptible to the same string order parameter , and vice versa  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , string order parameters are not well suited as order parameters for symmetry protected phases .    in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> we propose an order parameter which allows to distinguish symmetry - protected phases by directly measuring the way in which the physical symmetry acts on the entanglement between blocks . </S>",
    "<S> unlike string order parameters , it is independent of the state under consideration and only depends on the symmetry itself . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate our approach for the @xmath0 symmetry by numerically studying the spin@xmath1 bilinear  biquadratic model ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , where we find that the order parameter , though defined for asymptotically large blocks , converges very well for small lengths . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that while the order parameter is designed to work for the gapped phases of the system , namely the trivial and the haldane phase , it in fact also exhibits a distinct signature for the gapless critical and ferromagnetic phase of the model . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss how one could in principle experimentally implement a measurement of this order parameter , in particular with atoms in optical lattices .    </S>",
    "<S> let us start by explaining the structure of one - dimensional gapped phases under symmetries ; for simplicity , we will focus on systems with unique ground states . </S>",
    "<S> as such phases differ by their long - range properties , we first describe the structure of such states on large length scales , and in particular their renormalization group ( rg ) fixed points . due to the absence of topological entanglement in one dimension , at the rg fixed point of 1d systems each site independently shares entanglement with its two adjacent sites . </S>",
    "<S> this is , the overall state is of the form @xmath2 here , @xmath3 is a `` virtual '' entangled state between adjacent sites with schmidt spectrum @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is an isometry mapping the virtual entangled states into the physical system , acting jointly on the halves of two adjacent @xmath6 states , as depicted in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> , i.e. , it satisfies @xmath28 . as @xmath19 is only defined up to its phase ( and up to a similarity transform ) , we have a gauge degree of freedom @xmath29 which induces an equivalence relation @xmath30 of @xmath31-cocycles , and thus equivalence classes of projective representations . </S>",
    "<S> these equivalence classes form a group isomorphic to the second cohomology group @xmath32 , and label the inequivalent projective representations of the symmetry group @xmath11 . for the rotation group @xmath33 , </S>",
    "<S> e.g. , the inequivalent projective representations are the integer and half - integer spin representations , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the equivalence class of the projective representation @xmath19 , which describes the action of the symmetry on the virtual degrees of freedom , is exactly what labels different phases in the presence of symmetries  @xcite .     </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : xzxz ] ) ; note that operators traversed downwards have to be transposed . ]    in order to detect different symmetry protected phases , we therefore need a measurement which allows us to determine the equivalence class of the projective representation with which the symmetry acts on the entanglement between blocks . however , the problem is that while we know @xmath13 , it is impossible to infer sufficient information about @xmath19 from it  to do so we would have to know the transformation @xmath5 , which would require full tomography of the state   @xmath13 contains both the spin-@xmath37 and spin-@xmath1 representation , @xmath38 could act either as @xmath39 or as @xmath40 , depending on @xmath5 . ] . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , we do not need detailed knowledge of @xmath19 , since we only want to know to which equivalence class of projective representations it belongs . </S>",
    "<S> for this purpose , it is sufficient to compute certain gauge invariant quantities which give access to the gauge invariant universal signature of @xmath27 : for instance , for @xmath0 symmetry , one such quantity is @xmath41 , where @xmath42 denote @xmath43 rotations about the @xmath44 and the @xmath45 axis : it is @xmath46 for integer spin representations and @xmath47 for half - integer spin representations of @xmath0 , respectively , and does not depend on the gauge . </S>",
    "<S> ( see appendix a for other groups . ) thus , if we were able to measure such an invariant for a given state , we would be able to determine the symmetry protected phase the system is in . </S>",
    "<S> different from determining @xmath19 itself , this invariant can be determined without any information about @xmath5 , by measuring a suitable operator such as @xmath48 where @xmath49 swaps the first and the third site . </S>",

    "<S> simulations with different @xmath78 give similar results , except that the width of the transition regions between the phases decreases with increasing @xmath78 .    </S>",
    "<S> a closer analysis of the data reveals that inside both phases , @xmath64 converges exponentially with a length scale essentially equal to the correlation length ( deviation below @xmath79 ) . </S>",

    "<S> , we find that the estimator goes to zero algebraically . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite which we have included in our simulations , cf .  fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : estim - data ] . the results for this region should be taken with care , as mps perform considerably worse in describing the ground states of critical systems , and in particular can not exactly reproduce algebraically decaying correlations . analyzing the behavior of the order parameter in the critical regime </S>",
    "<S> , we find a dominating exponential decay due to the fact that @xmath78 is incommensurate with the symmetry , which is superimposed with an oscillation due to the @xmath91 periodicity of the critical phase  @xcite , @xmath92 . the parameters @xmath93 and @xmath94 can be extracted from the mps transfer operator , and we find that after correcting for these effects , @xmath95 ( plotted in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the results on the exponent should be taken with particularly great care , as they depend on the choice of data points fitted , and the algebraic decay observed is in fact a sum of exponentials ; yet , we believe that our results provide substantial evidence for an algebraically vanishing order parameter in the critical phase .    </S>",
    "<S> so far , we have shown that the order parameter @xmath99 can be used as a theoretical tool to determine the phases of 1d spin chains . </S>",
    "<S> now we will show that , at least in principle , it can also be experimentally determined by performing few measurements ( without the need of carrying out a full tomography ) . </S>",
    "<S> the main idea is to use an ancillary particle which controls whether the unitary and swapping operations appearing in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : estimator ] ) are applied or not , and then perform a measurement on that particle . </S>",
    "<S> let us assume that the ancilla is a qubit , initially prepared in the state @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> then , the ancilla interacts successively with particles in region 1 and 2 , 1 and 3 , and then again 1 and 2 , such that if it is in state @xmath101 , the unitary operator appearing in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : estimator ] ) is applied , and otherwise just the identity operator . at the end of the process , </S>",
    "<S> one measures the pauli operator @xmath102 on the ancilla , whose expectation value conincides with @xmath99 .    </S>",
    "<S> the techniques required to carry out the above procedure are very sophisticated , and we do not expect that they can be performed in most of the experimentally relevant situations ( beside atomic physics experiments , where individual addressing and full control over the atomic interactions may be gained in the near future @xcite ) . in any case , here we give an alternative method to detect the phase which may be slightly simpler to implement in the particular setup of atoms in optical lattices . </S>",
    "<S> the main idea is to use two copies of the spin chain , as it is usual in that setup ( for instance , with the help of superlattices @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> then , one would like to determine @xmath103 here , @xmath104 and @xmath105 refer to the first and second copy of the chain , and 1 , 2 , and 3 to three neighboring regions each containing a sufficiently large number of spins . </S>",
    "<S> one can easily convince oneself that @xmath106 contains the same information as @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of this measurement is that the swap only occurs between particles in two chains which are adjacent to each other . in practice , the ancilla could consist of a different atomic species ( see @xcite ) , so that it can be transported independently of the spin chains . </S>",
    "<S> as explained in that reference , one could use this ancilla to apply the conditional unitary operators sequentially to the spin chains . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the swapping operator can be generated by letting the ancilla control the pairwise interaction among the neighboring spins of the first and second chain in regions 1 and 3 , corresponding to a hamiltonian @xmath108 , where @xmath109 , for a time @xmath110 . </S>",
    "<S> we would like to emphasize that this procedure may be very difficult in practice , but it still shows that in principle one can measure the order parameter .    to conclude , in this paper we have introduced an order parameter for symmetry protected phases in one dimension . </S>",
    "<S> we have illustrated our construction for @xmath33 symmetry , where we have verified our predicitions numerically for the spin-@xmath1 bilinear - biquadratic model . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the order parameter allows to faithfully determine which gapped phase the system is in ; moreover , we found that ( somewhat surprisingly ) it also returns a distinct signature for the gapless phases of the model .    </S>",
    "<S> similar order parameters can be constructed for symmetry protected gapped phases with partial symmetry breaking  @xcite , by first using conventional local order parameters to detect which symmetries are broken , and subsequently measuring order parameters such as the one presented to detect the topological phase protected by the remaining unbroken symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting open question is whether our method to identify equivalence classes of @xmath31-cocycles , corresponding to elements in @xmath32 , can be modified to distinguish symmetry protected phases in two dimensions , which are labelled by equivalence classes of @xmath111-cocycles and correspondingly the third cohomology group @xmath112 . finally , as the endpoints of string operators </S>",
    "<S> can be interpreted as quasi - particles , it would be interesting to understand whether our order parameter can be effectively understood as extracting information about the quasi - particle braiding properties .    _ </S>",
