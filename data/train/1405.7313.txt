    "in the past decade , the negatively charged nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) centre in diamond @xcite has emerged as a very versatile solid - state system for studies of quantum information @xcite . the main characteristics that make it unique @xcite are its paramagnetic ground state @xcite , bright luminescence , extremely long spin coherence times @xcite , coupling to nearby nuclear spins @xcite , and the ability to initialize and read out the spin using optical techniques @xcite .",
    "increasingly , nv centres in bulk crystals and nanodiamonds are used for metrological applications at the nanoscale , i.e. , for measuring local magnetic @xcite and electric @xcite fields , temperature @xcite , and pressure @xcite .",
    "the negatively charged nv centre possesses @xmath0 symmetry and consists of a substitutional nitrogen atom adjacent to a nearby carbon vacancy ( figure  [ fig - nv](a ) ) with an additional trapped electron , the total electric charge thus being @xmath1 .",
    "the electronic structure of the ground and the lowest excited states of the centre is mainly determined by four electrons in atomically localized states of @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) symmetries ; the energy level diagram of the many - electron system is shown in figure [ fig - nv](b ) @xcite .",
    "the basics of nv physics is understood in terms of the ground - state triplet @xmath6 state ( configuration @xmath7 ) , the excited state triplet @xmath8 state ( configuration @xmath9 ) , and two singlet `` dark '' states @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( configuration @xmath7 ) .",
    "the singlets play a crucial role in both initialization and read - out of the ground - state spin @xcite .",
    "and @xmath3 states .",
    "( b ) energy - level diagram of the negatively charged nv centre .",
    "the luminescence occurs between triplet states @xmath8 and @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath12 is the energy of the zero - phonon line .",
    "( c ) one - dimensional cc diagram illustrating luminescence .",
    "@xmath13 are relaxation energies in the excited and the ground state . , width=585 ]",
    "nearly all of the applications of nv centres rely on measuring photoluminescence between @xmath8 and @xmath6 electronic states as a function of other experimental parameters @xcite . at low temperatures",
    "the luminescence band @xcite consists of a sharp zero - phonon line ( zpl ) at @xmath14 ev ( 637 nm ) , and @xmath15 increasingly broad phonon replicas with a phonon energy of @xmath16-@xmath17 mev , as schematically shown in figure [ fig - nv](c ) .",
    "a detailed analysis of the experimental phonon sideband was performed by davies @xcite . in particular , he determined the weight of the zpl @xmath18 % and a huang - rhys ( hr ) factor @xcite , in essence the average number of phonons emitted during the optical transition ( see section [ theory ] for a quantitative definition ) , @xmath19 .",
    "the relevance of the nv centre to a variety of applications and the crucial importance of the luminescence band in all these applications raises a question : can the luminescence lineshape , i.e. , the electron - phonon coupling during the optical transition , be calculated using first - principles calculations that require no experimental input ?",
    "such calculations should address an accurate determination of the huang - rhys factor , frequencies of dominant phonon modes , as well as the fine structure of the phonon sideband , including the coupling to long - range acoustic phonons .",
    "previous work @xcite has addressed the vibrational structure of nv centres to some extent ; however , because of finite - size effects the results of these calculations are somewhat ambiguous .",
    "no first - principles calculation of the luminescence lineshape has been performed to date .",
    "such a calculation would provide valuable information about electron - phonon coupling at nv centres , which at present is incompletely understood @xcite .",
    "in addition , if the theory is _ predictive _ , it can be applied to other defects , for example alternative systems that are currently being actively considered for quantum information and metrology applications @xcite , or defects that play an important role in light - emitting diodes @xcite .    in this work we present accurate calculations of the vibronic structure pertaining to the triplet luminescence band of the nv centre in diamond .",
    "we demonstrate that the combination of state - of - the - art first - principles methods , in particular hybrid density functional theory @xcite , and computational techniques to address electron - phonon coupling at large enough length scales to accurately include long - wavelength acoustic phonons , is very successful in describing the luminescence lineshape and all the related parameters .",
    "the experimental luminescence spectrum which serves as a benchmark for the theoretical study has been measured in our laboratory .",
    "the measured luminescence band is of a comparable quality to those of refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ theory ] we outline the general theory to calculate the vibrational structure of luminescence bands and describe our computational approach . in section [ experiment ] the details of acquiring and processing",
    "the experimental spectrum are presented .",
    "the results are presented in section [ results ] and analyzed in section [ analysis ] .",
    "section [ conclusions ] contains our conclusions .",
    "the paper is supplemented with four appendices that discuss specific technical issues in more detail .",
    "the excited state @xmath8 is an orbital doublet that forms an @xmath20 jahn - teller system via coupling to @xmath3 phonon modes @xcite .",
    "the jahn - teller effect is dynamical , since the energy splitting between the vibronic sub - levels is larger than the barrier in the adiabatic potential energy surface @xmath21 mev @xcite .",
    "the presence of this effect is manifest in the broadening of the zpl that follows a @xmath22 rather than the usual @xmath23 dependence at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "however , the effect is weak @xcite , and we will neglect it when calculating the phonon sideband .",
    "one way to judge the validity of this approximation is via an _ a posteriori _",
    "comparison @xcite .",
    "if a linear model of electron - phonon interactions , such as the one employed in this work , accurately describes the lineshape of the optical transition , then the jahn - teller effect can be considered negligible for this particular transition .",
    "as we show below , this turns out to be the case for the triplet luminescence at nv centres .",
    "we also assume that the transition dipole moment @xmath24 between the excited and the ground state depends weakly on lattice parameters ( the franck - condon approximation ) . at @xmath25",
    "k the absolute luminescence intensity @xmath26 ( i.e. , photons per unit time per unit energy ) for a given photon energy @xmath27 and for one emitting centre is given by ( in si units ) @xcite : @xmath28 here @xmath29 is the refractive index of diamond ; @xmath30 and @xmath31 are vibrational levels of the excited and the ground state ; @xmath32 is the energy of the state @xmath31 , being the sum over all vibrational modes @xmath33 , i.e. , @xmath34 ; and @xmath35 is the number of phonons of type @xmath33 in this state .",
    "the absolute angle - averaged value of @xmath36 is @xmath37 debye , as extracted from the radiative lifetime @xmath38 ns of the @xmath39 spin state of the @xmath40 manifold @xcite .",
    "a prefactor @xmath41 in equation ( [ lum - int ] ) arises from the density of states of photons that cause the spontaneous emission ( @xmath42 ) , and the perturbing electric field of those photons ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "this prefactor has to be taken into account when determining parameters pertaining to the luminescence lineshape , and this will be discussed in section [ hr3 ] . since in both the excited and the ground electronic state",
    "the system has @xmath0 symmetry , only fully symmetric @xmath2 phonons contribute to the sum in equation ( [ lum - int ] ) .",
    "the experimental determination of the absolute luminescence intensity given in equation ( [ lum - int ] ) is difficult .",
    "thus , in this work we will consider the normalized luminescence intensity , defined as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the optical spectral function , and @xmath46 is the normalization constant : @xmath47 ) .",
    "@xmath26 is related to @xmath48 via @xmath49 .",
    "the evaluation of the overlap integrals @xmath50 immediately poses a challenge .",
    "vibrational modes that enter into equation  ( [ spectral ] ) are not those of the pristine bulk , but rather those of the solid with a defect .",
    "the use of bulk modes can lead to large discrepancies with experiment , as we will show in section [ results ] .",
    "lattice imperfections induce localized or quasi - localized vibrational modes that depend on the local electronic structure ; in addition , the normal modes in the excited state and the ground state can be in principle quite different @xcite .",
    "this results in highly multidimensional integrals that can in practice be evaluated only for molecules @xcite , small atomic clusters @xcite , or model defect systems @xcite .",
    "some kind of approximation is thus unavoidable . here",
    "we assume that ( i ) the normal modes that contribute to the luminescence lineshape are still those of the solid with a defect , but ( ii ) the modes in the excited electronic state are identical to those in the ground state .",
    "such an assumption is implicit in virtually all studies of defects in solids @xcite .",
    "first - principles calculations @xcite , as well as a comparison of experimental absorption and emission spectra @xcite , indicate that the assumption does not strictly hold for the nv centre .",
    "since the more exact calculation is not feasible , the validity of this approximation has to be checked by comparing the results with the experimental spectrum .",
    "when vibrational modes in the ground and the excited state are identical , the optical spectral function @xmath51 ( equation  ( [ spectral ] ) ) can be calculated using a generating function approach proposed by lax @xcite , as well as kubo and toyozawa @xcite .",
    "the fundamental quantity that has to be calculated is the spectral function ( also called spectral density ) of electron - phonon coupling @xcite @xmath52 where the sum is over all phonon modes @xmath33 with frequencies @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is the ( partial ) huang - rhys factor for the mode @xmath33 .",
    "it is defined as @xcite @xmath55 with @xmath56 @xmath57 labels atoms , @xmath58 , @xmath59 is the mass of atom @xmath57 ( carbon or nitrogen , average atomic masses of naturally occurring isotopes were used ) , @xmath60 is the equilibrium position in the initial ( excited ) and the final ( ground ) excited state , and @xmath61 is a normalized vector that describes the displacement of the atom @xmath57 along the direction @xmath62 in the phonon mode @xmath33 .",
    "one can use an alternative expression for @xmath63 : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the change of the force on the atom @xmath57 along the direction @xmath62 for a fixed position of all atoms when the electronic state of the defect changes from @xmath8 to @xmath6 .",
    "the latter equation directly follows from the relationship @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the hessian matrix , different from the dynamical matrix only because of additional mass prefactors in the latter .",
    "the two formulations are completely equivalent in the harmonic approximation . in [ 1d ] we show that if the dynamical jahn - teller effect is neglected the anharmonicities are indeed minute . while being in principle equivalent",
    ", the use of equation  ( [ qk2 ] ) instead of equation  ( [ qk ] ) offers a huge advantage when dealing with large systems , i.e. , when extrapolating @xmath68 to the dilute limit , and this is discussed in section [ ab - initio ] and [ supercell ] .",
    "once @xmath68 is determined , the spectral function @xmath51 ( equation  ( [ spectral ] ) ) is given as the fourier transform of the generating function @xmath69 @xcite : @xmath70 the generating function @xmath69 itself is defined as @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 is the total hr factor for a given optical transition . in equation  ( [ spectral2 ] )",
    "the parameter @xmath74 represents the broadening of the zpl . in real situations",
    "this broadening has two contributions : the homogeneous broadening due to anharmonic phonon interactions @xcite and the inhomogeneous broadening due to ensemble averaging . since neither of these two effects",
    "is modeled in our approach , @xmath74 is chosen to reproduce the experimental width of the zpl .",
    "the partial hr factor @xmath54 defined in equation  ( [ sk ] ) is the average number of phonons of type @xmath33 emitted during an optical transition @xcite .",
    "the total hr factor , defined in equation  ( [ hr ] ) , is then the number of phonons off all kinds that are emitted during the same transition .",
    "the hr factor is thus an important parameter that characterizes the vibrational structure of the luminescence band .",
    "if ( i ) there was no additional prefactor @xmath75 in the expression for the luminescence intensity in equation  ( [ norm - lum - int ] ) and ( ii ) the vibrational modes in the excited and the ground state were indeed identical , then the weight of the zero - phonon line would be given by @xcite @xmath76 since this line corresponds , by definition , to zero absorbed or emitted phonons , @xmath77 is often called the debye - waller factor , in analogy with x - ray scattering , where it represents the ratio of the elastic to the total scattering cross section . therefore",
    ", we also use this nomenclature to comply with the accepted practice .    the debye - waller factor",
    "@xmath77 is a quantity that is directly measurable in experiment , and its determination is therefore unambiguous . in practical situations",
    "the hr factor is often deduced from the relationship @xmath78 , where we have added a `` tilde '' to distinguish this quantity from the actual hr factor @xmath79 , which is defined by equation  ( [ hr ] ) .",
    "@xmath80 differs from @xmath79 because of the additional assumption ( i ) .    the spectral weight in @xmath48 ( equation  ( [ norm - lum - int ] ) ) moves to slightly higher energies in comparison to @xmath51 due to the prefactor @xmath41 .",
    "this increases the weight of the zpl , @xmath77 , if determined from @xmath48 , and thus decreases the value of @xmath81 with respect to @xmath79 .",
    "this distinction has to be borne in mind when comparing different experimental papers . in this paper",
    "we will consistently use @xmath77 and @xmath79 in their original definitions .      in this work the spectral function of electron - phonon coupling @xmath68 ( equations([e - ph1])-([qk ] ) ) is calculated within density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "the electronic , atomic , and vibrational properties of the nv centre are calculated in the supercell approach @xcite , whereby one defect is embedded in a sufficiently large piece of host material , which is periodically repeated .",
    "we take a conventional cubic cell with 8 carbon atoms as the building block for larger supercells .",
    "the cubic supercell @xmath82@xmath83@xmath82@xmath83@xmath82 , for example , contains @xmath84=@xmath85 atomic sites .    to study the electronic and vibrational structure of defects we use two different exchange - correlation ( xc ) functionals : the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) in the form proposed by perdew , burke , and ernzerhof ( pbe ) @xcite and the screened hybrid functional of heyd , scuseria , and ernzerhof ( hse ) @xcite .",
    "pbe is known to describe structural properties of many materials with high accuracy , but the calculated band gaps of semiconductors and insulators agree poorly with experiment , and this also affects the position of defect levels within the band gap .",
    "the hse functional overcomes this problem by incorporating a fraction @xmath86 of screened fock exchange ( screening parameter @xmath87 @xmath88 ) .",
    "hse calculations yield excellent results for excitation energies for the spin - triplet optical transition in nv centres @xcite .",
    "the properties of the excited state @xmath8 have been calculated using the constrained occupation method of slater @xcite , as first applied to the nv centre by gali _",
    "_ @xcite . in this method",
    "one electron from the @xmath2 orbital is promoted to one of the @xmath3 orbitals .",
    "the electronic and the atomic structure is optimized with a hole in the @xmath2 state . to circumvent the problems with the jahn - teller distortion in the excited state , resulting from the degeneracy of the nominal @xmath89 and @xmath90 configurations , the coordinate dependence of the total energy in the excited state",
    "is studied here by constraining the configuration to @xmath91 .",
    "this is a practical solution to restrict the excited state density to be the average of the two degenerate configurations , retaining a @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "we find that while the integrated parameters , for example the total hr factor @xmath79 ( equation  ( [ hr ] ) ) converge quickly when the size of the defect supercell is increased , the convergence of the spectral function @xmath68 ( equation  ( [ e - ph1 ] ) ) is significantly slower .",
    "this is a particular concern for the spectral function at lower energies , i.e. , coupling to long - range acoustic phonons .",
    "as an example , let us consider a @xmath92@xmath83@xmath92@xmath83@xmath92 simple cubic supercell , containing 64 lattice sites . without a defect",
    ", the lowest energy @xmath93-point vibration of such a supercell corresponds to the bulk transverse acoustic ( ta ) mode at the @xmath94 point with an energy of about @xmath95 mev .",
    "this is even higher than the experimentally determined energy of the dominant phonon mode at the nv centre , being @xmath96=@xmath97-@xmath17 mev .",
    "clearly , supercells of this size are insufficient to determine @xmath68 .    to obtain converged results and determine the nature of vibrational states",
    ", we have performed calculations for a series of supercells : from @xmath92@xmath83@xmath92@xmath83@xmath92 ( 64 sites ) up to @xmath98@xmath83@xmath98@xmath99 ( 10648 sites ) . since",
    "a direct approach for supercells containing more than a few hundred atoms is computationally too demanding , we have developed a special methodology to achieve this goal .",
    "first , in [ 1d ] we show that it is an excellent approximation to calculate vibrational properties at the pbe level , since the relevant vibrational modes are very similar in the pbe as compared to the hse functional .",
    "this presents huge computational savings , since hse calculations are up to two orders of magnitude more expensive .",
    "then in [ supercell ] we present a methodology to calculate vibrational spectra and spectral functions @xmath68 for very large systems . in short ,",
    "the procedure is as follows .",
    "partial huang - rhys factors for large systems are determined from equation ( [ qk2 ] ) .",
    "forces @xmath100 in the large supercell @xmath82@xmath83@xmath82@xmath83@xmath82 ( @xmath101 ) , needed in that approach , are obtained from the calculation of a smaller supercell ( @xmath102@xmath83@xmath102@xmath83@xmath102 ) via a suitable embedding procedure , explained in [ supercell ] .",
    "for these large defect supercells , vibrational modes and frequencies , that also appear in expression ( [ qk2 ] ) , have been determined by diagonalizing the dynamical matrix constructed from dynamical matrices of bulk diamond and nv centre in the @xmath103@xmath83@xmath103@xmath83@xmath103 supercell .",
    "the validity of the procedure relies on the fact that the dynamical matrix of diamond is rather short - ranged .",
    "specific parameters of the procedure are determined from accurate convergence tests , and are discussed in [ supercell ] .",
    "defect calculations have been performed with the vasp code @xcite , and the interaction with ionic cores was described via the projector - augmented wave ( paw ) formalism @xcite .",
    "a kinetic energy cutoff of 400 ev ( 29.4 ry ) has been used for the expansion of electronic wavefunctions . for the @xmath104 supercell",
    "the brillouin zone was sampled using a @xmath105 @xmath33-point mesh , and @xmath93-point sampling was used for larger supercells .    to produce additional insights ,",
    "we have also calculated @xmath68 ( equation  ( [ sk ] ) ) and @xmath48 ( equation  ( [ norm - lum - int ] ) ) with an additional assumption , namely that phonon modes that contribute to the luminescence lineshape are those of the unperturbed host @xcite . for this purpose",
    "we have determined the vibrational modes of bulk diamond using density functional perturbation theory @xcite , reproducing earlier calculations @xcite .",
    "vibrational modes were determined on a very fine @xmath106 @xmath33-point grid close to the brillouin zone centre , and a courser @xmath107 grid elsewhere .",
    "these calculations have been performed using the quantum espresso code @xcite within the local density approximation @xcite ; this xc functional describes phonons modes of _ bulk _ diamond very well @xcite . to evaluate @xmath68 ,",
    "the modes were mapped to the @xmath93-point of the desired supercell .",
    "the contributions from the vacancy site are set to zero in equations  ( [ qk ] ) and equation  ( [ qk2 ] ) , while the mass of the nitrogen atom was set to be equal to that of the carbon atom in this case .",
    "the nv centre photoluminescence ( pl ) spectrum was taken at 8 k on an ensemble of nv centres using a home - built confocal setup .",
    "the diamond sample used was a sumitomo high - pressure , high - temperature grown ib sumicrystal with a specified nitrogen content of @xmath108 parts per million . the sample was irradiated with 2 mev electrons at a dose of @xmath109 electrons/@xmath110 and annealed at 850 @xmath111c for 2 hours to generate a high density of nv centres within the bulk .",
    "the nv centres were photo - excited with 532 nm light with sufficiently low intensity to suppress the luminescence of neutral ( nv@xmath112 ) centres .",
    "subsequent pl was collected into a spectrometer with @xmath1130.3 mev spectral resolution .",
    "the spectrum intensity was calibrated by measuring the nominally - known spectrum of an oceanoptics ls-1-ll tungsten halogen light source placed at the same position of the diamond sample within the optical setup .",
    "the experimentally obtained spectrum was normalized to 1 for comparison with the theoretical calculations . for normalization purposes the low - energy tail of the spectrum",
    "was modeled as an exponential function .",
    "the weight of the zero - phonon line ( debye - waller factor ) was determined to be @xmath114% .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath115 , in very close agreement with ref .",
    "the actual huang - rhys factor can be estimated to be @xmath116 .",
    "for the @xmath102@xmath83@xmath102@xmath83@xmath102 supercell , the largest system for which we have performed actual electronic structure calculations , @xmath12 was calculated to be 1.757 ev using the pbe functional , and 2.035 ev using the hse functional .",
    "the latter is thus much closer to the experimental value of 1.945 ev .",
    "our calculations agree with those of gali _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and weber _ et al .",
    "the hse functional is clearly superior for describing the local electronic structure of the nv centre @xcite .",
    "the difference of about 0.1 ev between the experimental and calculated zpl is within the error bar of the hse calculations , but would complicate direct comparisons between theoretical and experimental lineshapes . to enable a more meaningful comparison , in all subsequent analysis we set @xmath12 to the experimental value .",
    "thus , the broadening of the zpl @xmath74 in equation ( [ spectral2 ] ) and the value @xmath12 are the sole instances where information from experiment has been used in the theoretical results .",
    "we first analyze the convergence of @xmath68 when the size of the supercell is increased .",
    "in addition to providing justification for the computational procedure , such a study provides insights into the origin of vibrational modes that contribute to the phonon sideband .",

    "@xcite ( 59.7 and 77.0 mev ) , who studied local vibrational modes for this size of supercell .",
    "while the energy of the first mode is close to the energy of the most pronounced phonon mode seen in experiment , this agreement is largely fortuitous , since , as mentioned in section [ ab - initio ] , the lowest - energy bulk ta phonon mode in this supercell has a similar energy .",
    "the low - energy tail that represents the coupling to long - range phonons ( @xmath12160 mev ) is completely missing for this supercell , and the total hr factor @xmath122 ( inset of figure [ sw - conv ] ) is 20% smaller than the converged value @xmath123 .    in the case of a larger @xmath124 supercell ,",
    "the most dominant vibration is the 45.9 mev mode .",
    "this result is an artifact resulting from the use of a small cell , since this vibration corresponds to the lowest - energy @xmath93-point bulk ta phonon  it is not an actual defect - derived mode . while the total hr factor increases to @xmath125 , @xmath68 is still far from converged .",
    "this emphasizes possible dangers in drawing conclusions about local vibrational modes from small - size supercells @xcite .",
    "when increasing the size of the supercell further , @xmath68 slowly attains its converged form .",

    "the @xmath17 mev vibration is not a localized phonon mode , but a defect - induced vibrational resonance : it occurs within the spectrum of bulk phonon modes ( 0 - 167 mev ) . in figure [ sw - conv ]",
    "this result is evident from the fact that for larger supercells this mode splits into many closely spaced modes , with a simultaneous decrease of their absolute contributions .",
    "the 65 mev resonance is induced by the nv centre itself , and can not be understood solely by considering bulk phonon spectrum .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure [ sw - all ] and discussed in more detail in section [ comp - lumin ] .",
    "2 .   in agreement with a general theory of vibrational broadening of luminescence lines",
    "@xcite , the spectral function is linear for small energies , i.e. , @xmath129 for @xmath130 . indeed , partial hr factors corresponding to acoustic modes scale like @xmath131 , which , multiplied with the density of states of acoustic modes @xmath42 , yields this linear dependence .",
    "while this general behaviour is known @xcite , we emphasize that the _ prefactor _ to the linear dependence is system dependent , and only accurate atomistic calculations such as the ones presented here can provide the actual value . in our case we obtain @xmath132 mev@xmath133 ev@xmath134 .",
    "interaction via acoustic phonons has been recently proposed as a promising mechanism to couple two nv centres in nanodiamonds @xcite .",
    "the coupling of isolated qubits is essential for any quantum computing protocol .",
    "our calculations provide information about the coupling of nv centers to acoustic phonons in bulk diamond , and can be useful pursuing the ideas proposed in ref.@xcite ideas further .",
    "99% of the lattice distortions due to the optical transition , as quantified by their contribution to @xmath68 , occur within @xmath135 @xmath136 of the nv centre .",

    "vibrational modes and frequencies have been determined by diagonalizing dynamical matrices obtained directly from the supercell calculation .    for larger supercells",

    "first , we performed constrained geometry relaxations for the @xmath102@xmath83@xmath102@xmath83@xmath102 supercell ( 512 lattice sites ) with a defect in the middle of the supercell . in the calculations for the excited state the atoms within 3 @xmath136 of the vacancy were allowed to relax , while the remaining atoms were kept in their ideal lattice positions ( figure [ large](a ) ) .",
    "this procedure yields zero forces @xmath191 within this chosen radius ( white inner circle in figure [ large](a ) ) .",
    "the forces @xmath191 are non - zero for the atoms that were kept in their bulk positions .",

    "the crucial point is that there are no net forces exerted on atoms that are at the boundary of this supercell .",
    "subsequently , we kept the geometry of the defect as optimized according to this procedure , but determined the forces @xmath192 on atoms when the electronic state is changed to that of the ground state ( figure [ large](b ) ) .",
    "the resulting forces are non - zero in the entire region , shown as a yellow circle in figure [ large](b ) , but essentially vanish beyond it .",
    "these two calculations yield the difference @xmath193 needed to determine partial hr factors via equations  ( [ sk ] ) and ( [ qk2 ] ) .",
    "the fact that the forces are essentially zero beyond the yellow circle in figure [ large ] ( a ) and ( b ) does not mean that these atoms stay in their bulk position .",
    "if the constraints were relieved , these atoms would move to find their equilibrium positions during a full geometry optimization , since the movement of their neighbours during this optimization would result in a build - up of forces .",
    "the point is that equation ( [ qk2 ] ) includes this automatically .     for large supercells .",

    "otherwise , if one of the atoms is within 2.5 @xmath136 of the vacancy or the nitrogen atom , the matrix element is taken from the calculation of the @xmath103@xmath83@xmath103@xmath195 supercell .",
    "for other pairs we use bulk diamond values .",
    "the choice or parameters leads to a converged vibrational spectrum of the @xmath102@xmath83@xmath102@xmath83@xmath102 defect supercell .",

    "<S> in this work we present theoretical calculations and analysis of the vibronic structure of the spin - triplet optical transition in diamond nitrogen - vacancy centres . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic structure of the defect is described using accurate first - principles methods based on hybrid functionals . </S>",
    "<S> we devise a computational methodology to determine the coupling between electrons and phonons during an optical transition in the dilute limit . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , our approach yields a smooth spectral function of electron - phonon coupling and includes both quasi - localized and bulk phonons on equal footings . </S>",
    "<S> the luminescence lineshape is determined via the generating function approach . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a highly accurate description of the luminescence band , including all key parameters such as the huang - rhys factor , the debye - waller factor , and the frequency of the dominant phonon mode . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , our work provides insight into the vibrational structure of nitrogen vacancy centres , in particular the role of local modes and vibrational resonances . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find that the pronounced mode at 65 mev is a vibrational resonance , and we quantify localization properties of this mode . these excellent results for the benchmark diamond nitrogen - vacancy centre provide confidence that the procedure can be applied to other defects , including alternative systems that are being considered for applications in quantum information processing . </S>"
