    "a similar no - go theorem is valid for cloning of an _ unknown quantum gate _ from one to two copies @xcite ; that is to say , given a set of distinct states @xmath0 and an unknown unitary channel @xmath1 , it is impossible to prepare @xmath2 by a quantum circuit that uses @xmath1 only once .",
    "this result has implications in cryptographic protocols where the secret is encoded in unitary transformations instead of quantum states , e.g. , an alternative version of bb84 protocol where alice uses two orthogonal bases of unitary transformations instead of states @xcite .",
    "+ the no - cloning of states is about the impossibility of realizing a specific transformation of _ states _ , while the no - cloning of gates is about a transformation of _ unitary channels_. other examples of no - go theorems on transformations of quantum channels are : the impossibility of realizing the _ switch _ circuit defined by @xmath3 , in which a pair of input unitary blackboxes @xmath4 and @xmath5 are connected in two different orders conditioned on the value of an input bit @xcite . by generalizing the conventional quantum circuit model to bypass this no - go result , a computational advantage can be obtained @xcite .",
    "another example is the no - go theorem on controlling a unitary gate given as a blackbox discussed in @xcite , or failure of programming a quantum gate array @xmath6 that deterministically implements the unitary operation @xmath1 determined by the quantum program @xmath7 or strictly speaking @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper , we introduce and investigate a new no - go theorem on _ iterations of an unknown quantum gate_. the iteration of a unitary gate is widely used in quantum algorithms .",
    "quantum search algorithms like grover algorithm @xcite or quantum random walk search algorithm @xcite are based on the repetition of a unitary oracle .",
    "they use iterations of the oracle to amplify the amplitude of a desired state in a superposition of states @xcite . quantum phase estimation @xcite",
    "is another algorithm in which successive iterations of a unitary gate are used to generate states appropriate for an inverse quantum fourier transform .",
    "these algorithms are bases of other quantum computations like order finding @xcite , integer factorization and discrete logarithms @xcite or the collision problem @xcite .",
    "+ the question we try to answer is whether it is possible to avoid iterations of a unitary oracle using a deterministic quantum circuit .",
    "one possible scenario for doing this is that an apparatus called _ gate iterator _ of the @xmath9th order ( @xmath10 ) , denoted by @xmath11 , takes a unitary oracle @xmath1 , an arbitrary state @xmath12 and the state of the rest of the world @xmath13 as inputs , and by calling @xmath1 once , gives @xmath14 as the output .",

    "we first consider the most general circuit for doing the iteration consists of a _ preprocessing _ and a _ postprocessing _ channel .",

    "+ although it is not possible to construct @xmath11 perfectly , it is natural to ask for strategies that realize it in an approximate way .",
    "we propose such schemes and then , by using the notion of _ fidelity _ as a figure of merit , we investigate their performance and how it scales with the number of iterations @xmath9 , and the dimensionality of the state @xmath17 .",
    "we also address the problem of finding the optimal iterator .",
    "we show that the optimal fidelity is the answer of a semidefinite programming .",

    "we show that in all strategies , including the optimal , by increasing the dimension of the system @xmath17 , the fidelity decreases .",
    "intriguingly , the fidelity reaches a constant value by increasing @xmath9 , so when we are allowed to query a unitary oracle only once , there is no difference in quality of high - order imperfect iterations of that .",
    "another interesting observation is that when @xmath19 , a trivial strategy like approximating @xmath20 by @xmath1 or even by the identity channel has the optimal performance , and preprocessing , postprocessing , or using resources like entanglement does not help at all .",
    "these results are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : plot1 ] , [ fig : plot_data_2 ] and [ fig : data_plot_3 ] .",
    "+ an anticipated result of our no - go theorem is that when the oracle is completely unknown , the only way to perform iterations of that , seems to be calling the oracle each time and give the state to that and do this repeatedly . for a large number of iterations ,",
    "this makes the algorithm inefficient .",
    "in fact , one way of comparing the complexity of different algorithms is to count the necessary number of querying within the program @xcite .",

    "we have shown that it is impossible to iterate an unknown quantum gate by using it once , what we called it the no - iteration theorem .",
    "we have also investigated different schemes to approximately bypass this no - go result : ( 1 ) the random guess strategy in which iterations of a randomly chosen gate is performed .",

    "in addition , by using the notion of quantum comb , we have been able to state the problem of finding the optimal iterator as a semidefinite programming , which we have solved numerically for @xmath18 .",
    "+ the iteration problem has some unique features that make it different from similar problems like cloning of unitary channels .",
    "one is that the performance of all discussed methods including the optimal one , remains the same for highly enough orders @xmath9 . in the case of random guess",
    ", we saw the connection of this phase transition to the joint distribution of eigenvalues of a random unitary matrix , which changes from being highly ordered to having no structure for @xmath116 .",
    "the other feature is that the performance of trivial processes like identity or direct channels is comparable to the optimal strategies , and at least for @xmath203 , numerical solutions show they achieve the optimum performance for @xmath204 . +",
    "this no - go theorem is another example of transformations of quantum channels that can not be realized perfectly .",
    "providing these examples helps us to understand the characteristics of quantum operations as _ carriers of information _ , and shows us how laws of quantum mechanics act when evolution of operations is considered instead of states .",
    "+ interesting behaviors of gate iterators discussed in this paper , motivates a more general study of powers of unitary operators in @xmath205 limit .",
    "the iteration problem and the performance of the optimal iterator might also be explored when multiple copies of the oracle is provided .",
    "according to the following lemma , proved as a theorem in @xcite , there exists a lower bound on the performance of quantum search algorithms .",
    "this lower bound is only a few percent smaller than the number of iterations required by grover s algorithm @xcite .",
    "let @xmath206 be any set of @xmath207 strings , and @xmath208 be any oracle quantum machine with bounded error probability .",
    "let @xmath209 be a randomly and uniformly chosen element from @xmath206 .",
    "put @xmath210 to be the oracle where @xmath211 if and only if @xmath212 . then the expected number of times @xmath208 must query @xmath210 in order to determine @xmath213 with probability at least @xmath214 is at least @xmath215 .",
    "now imagine that @xmath11 can be constructed perfectly , then for an appropriate number of strings @xmath207 , the required number of queries can be reduced .",
    "this can be done easily by replacing each @xmath9 successive queries in grover search algorithm with a single use of @xmath11 .",
