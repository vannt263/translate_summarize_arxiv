    "the quantum transport through junctions to unconventional superconductors has attracted much attention in recent years , in particular , in view of various recently discovered compounds belonging probably to this class of systems , such as sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2  @xcite ( sro ) , uge@xmath1  @xcite , zrzn@xmath1  @xcite , urhge  @xcite , cein@xmath7 and cepd@xmath1si@xmath1  @xcite . in such systems zero - energy states",
    "@xcite ( zes ) formed at interfaces affect crucially the transport properties through junctions . in normal - metal / high-@xmath8 superconductor  @xcite junctions , for instance , a large peak due to the zes is observed in the conductance at the zero - bias voltage  @xcite .",
    "the resonant tunneling via the zes enhances the andreev reflection  @xcite , which leads to the low - temperature anomaly in the josephson current , e.g. between two @xmath9-wave superconductors  @xcite .",
    "the low - temperature anomaly in the josephson current is a rather common phenomenon for unconventional superconductors including those with spin - triplet pairing  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of a logarithmic temperature dependence of the critical josephson current was also predicted for junctions between two sro samples  @xcite .",
    "the josephson current - phase relation can be decomposed into a series of contributions of different order @xmath10 where @xmath4 is the phase - difference across junctions .",
    "the coefficients @xmath11 vanish for all @xmath12 as long as time reversal symmetry is conserved , since in this case @xmath13 implies @xmath14 . as we will deal in the following with a superconducting phase which break time reversal symmetry , we will keep these terms . in the most simple approach , the lowest order contribution @xmath15 vanishes , for a junction of the composition spin - singlet superconductor / insulator / spin - triplet superconductor  @xcite , because the wave function of the two superconducting condensates are in orbital and spin part orthogonal to each other . in this case the second order contribution with the josephson current proportional to @xmath5 is leading .",
    "the presence of spin - flip scattering and the breaking of parity at the interface between different materials , would invalidate this simple - minded argumentation .",
    "a magnetically active interface yielding spin - flip contributions occurs in the presence of spin - orbit coupling . obviously , spin - orbit coupling yields new selection rules , because spin and orbital `` angular momentum '' need not to be conserved independently , but rather only the `` total angular momentum '' has to remain unchanged in the tunneling process .",
    "then lowest order coupling , @xmath15 and/or @xmath16 , can be finite  @xcite , so that spin - orbit coupling modifies the current - phase relation of the josephson effect between singlet and triplet superconductors qualitatively .",
    "in this paper we study the effect of spin - orbit coupling on the josephson effect for the example of the chiral @xmath17-wave state which is most likely realized in sro  @xcite.this state breaks time reversal symmetry with an angular momentum along the c - axis and has inplane equal spin pairing  @xcite .",
    "so far the transport properties in junctions consisting of sro and @xmath0-wave superconductors or normal metals have been studied in both theories  @xcite and experiments  @xcite .",
    "the effect of spin - orbit coupling , where it had been taken into account , was introduced in form of effective matrix elements only without the care of a detailed microscopic model for their origin . here",
    "we will consider a model which explicitly introduces spin - orbit coupling as an interface effect and allows us to study the symmetry related issues of the interface by direct variation of coupling parameters .",
    "our model ignores the spin - orbit coupling effects in the bulk of the two superconductors for the reason that details of the ionic lattice and the band structure would play an essential role , both of which are not easy to implement in a simple model of an unconventional superconductor .",
    "furthermore , we aim here also at effects of the zes on the josephson current in connection with the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec  ii , we explain a theoretical model . the josephson current is derived in sec .",
    "the conclusion is given in sec .",
    "we consider here a junction as shown in fig . 1 between an @xmath0-wave superconductor ( left hand side ) and a @xmath17-wave superconductor ( right hand side ) where the later shall be in the chiral @xmath17-wave state    @xmath18    as proposed for sro .",
