    "currently most of the experimental studies as well as modeling of the nucleus - nucleus ( proton - nucleus ) collisions involve using the glauber model .",
    "namely , the number of involved nucleons is calculated probabilistically assuming that each nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) inelastic collision is determined by the value of @xmath1 at the collision energy .    however , the dominance of large longitudinal distances in high energy scattering @xcite changes qualitatively the pattern of multiple interactions .",
    "indeed , in the glauber approximation high energy interactions of the projectile with a target occur via consecutive rescatterings of the projectile off the constituents of the target .",
    "the projectile during the interactions is on mass shell ",
    "one takes the residues in the propagators of the projectile .",
    "this approximation contradicts the qcd based space - time evolution of high energy processes dominated by particles production .",
    "the projectile interacts with the target in frozen configurations since the life time of the configurations becomes much larger than the size of the target .",
    "hence there is no time for a frozen configuration in the projectile to combine back into the projectile during the time of the order @xmath2 , the radius of the target . as a result",
    "the amplitudes described by glauber model diagrams die out at large energies @xmath3 ( a formal proof which is based on the analytic properties of the feynman diagrams was given in @xcite ) .    in the glauber model",
    "the number of interacting nucleons is calculated probabilistically assuming that the probability of individual nn inelastic collisions is determined by the value of @xmath1 at the collision energy .",
    "fluctuations of the number of wounded nucleons at a given impact parameter are generated solely by fluctuations of the positions of nucleons in the nucleus and ( in some models ) due to peripheral collisions of nucleons , where the interaction is gray and hence the chance to interact differs from one or zero .",
    "hard collisions are treated as binary collisions , which is equivalent to taking the diagonal generalized parton densities of nuclei , @xmath4 , proportional to the impact factor @xmath5 : f_a(x , q^2 , b)= f_n(x , q^2)t(b ) , where @xmath5 is normalized as @xmath6 . a nuclear shadowing correction is introduced for @xmath7 .",
    "the high energy theory of soft interactions with nuclei was developed by gribov @xcite who expressed the shadowing contribution to the cross section of hadron - nucleus ( ha ) interactions through the contribution of non - planar diagrams .",
    "the gribov - glauber theory , in difference from the low energy glauber theory , requires taking into account that a particular quark - gluon configuration of the projectile is frozen during the collision and that it may interact with different strength as compared to the average strength .",
    "this leads to fluctuations of the number of collisions which are significantly larger than in the glauber model .",
    "the fluctuations of the strength of the interaction are related to the ratio of inelastic and elastic diffraction in nn scattering at @xmath8 .",
    "relevance of fluctuations of the strength was first pointed out in @xcite but these effects were never analyzed in detail before .",
    "another effect contributing to fluctuations of observables in ha collisions is fluctuations of the gluon density which can originate both from the fluctuations of the nucleon configurations and from the fluctuations of the gluon densities in the individual nucleons",
    ". we will consider this effect elsewhere .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : sec2 ] we summarize the necessary information about fluctuations of the strength of nn interaction . in section [ sec : sec3 ]",
    "we use the gribov - glauber model in the optical approximation to obtain analytic results for the strength of fluctuations of the number of wounded nucleons and relative contributions to these fluctuations of the fluctuations of the strength of the interaction and of geometry of collisions . in section",
    "[ sec : sec4 ] we develop a full monte carlo ( mc ) model in which the geometry of projectile  target nucleon interaction is accounted for , and the strength of the interaction fluctuates on an event - by - event basis .",
    "the results for the change of the distribution over the number of collisions and for the dependence of the average strength of the interaction on impact parameter are presented .",
    "possibilities for observing color fluctuation effects in collisions with hard triggers are outlined .",
    "it was demonstrated by gribov @xcite that the nuclear shadowing contribution to the total cross section of the hadron - deuteron scattering can be expressed through the diffraction cross section at @xmath8 .",
    "operationally this amounts to the replacement in the glauber formul of the elastic hn cross section at @xmath9 by the sum of elastic and diffractive cross section at @xmath8 , leading to an enhancement of the multinucleon interactions . for heavier nuclei",
    "the gribov formul involve the coupling of the projectile to @xmath10 vacuum exchanges which has to be modeled .",
    "the contribution of the double scattering to the total hadron - nucleon ( hn ) cross section is enhanced by a factor @xmath11 , where _ = .. d(h n x n)dt / d(h n h n)dt.|_t = o .",
    "the relation between the double scattering cross section and the total diffraction cross section can be naturally understood in the good and walker formalism @xcite , which provided the effective realization of the feinberg - pomeranchuk picture @xcite of the inelastic diffraction . in this formalism one",
    "introduces eigenstates of the scattering matrix diagonal in @xmath12 ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review .",
    "configurations with different @xmath13 scatter without interference off two target nucleons contributing in the case of scattering of two nucleons with strength @xmath14 to the shadowing of the total cross section .",
    "this is the same quantity as in the expression for the total cross section of hadron - nucleon diffraction at @xmath8 .",
    "this interpretation of the gribov result for the shadowing correction to the total cross section was first given by kopeliovich and lapidus @xcite .",
    "the fluctuations of strength of interaction arise naturally in qcd where the strength of interaction depends on the volume occupied by color . in particular",
    ", the presence of some small configurations leads to fluctuations interacting with a small cross section .",
    "so we will refer to these fluctuations as color fluctuations .    in order to describe the effect of color fluctuations for a variety of processes it is convenient to introduce the notion of distribution over the strength of interaction , @xmath15 - the probability for an incoming hadron to interact with total cross section @xmath16 .",
    "the distribution @xmath15 satisfies two normalization sum rules : [ cond1 ] d_totp_h(_tot)=1 , d_tot_totp_h(_tot)=_tot^hn , and the miettenen - pumplin relation @xcite [ cond3 ] d_tot p_h(_tot)= _ , where @xmath17 is the free cross section .",
    "experimentally , @xmath18 first grows with energy then starts dropping at energies @xmath19 100 gev .",
    "there are no direct measurements at the rhic energy of 200 gev , but an overall analysis indicates that it is of the order 0.25 .",
    "the first lhc data seem to indicate that inelastic diffraction still constitutes a large fraction of the cross section - it is comparable to the elastic cross section , suggesting @xmath20 at those energies .",
    "it is difficult at the moment to ascribe error bars to these numbers .",
    "however , it is expected that the values of @xmath18 corresponding to the lhc energies will be soon measured with a good precision .",
    "it is worth emphasizing here that these seemingly small values of @xmath18 correspond to very large fluctuations of the interaction strength .",
    "for example , if we consider a simple two component model ( equivalent to the quasi - eikonal approximation ) , in which two components are present in the projectile wave function with equal probability and interact with strengths @xmath21 and @xmath22 : ^(1)_tot=^hn_tot(1- ) , ^(2)_tot=^hn_tot(1 + ) . thus for @xmath23 , we have @xmath24 , @xmath25 and hence @xmath26 .",
    "in order to illustrate the effects of the color fluctuations and their interplay with the fluctuations of the local nuclear density we first consider the optical approximation of the glauber model where the radius of the nn interaction is neglected as compared to the distance between the nucleons .    within this model",
    "the total inelastic hadron - nucleus cross section @xmath27 can be written as follows : @xmath28^{a}\\right ) =    \\sum^{a}_{n = 1 } \\frac{(-1)^{n + 1 } a!}{(a - n ) ! \\,n ! }    \\int   d\\vec{b}\\ , x(b)^{n}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath29 and normalization @xmath6",
    ".    note that in eq .",

    "( [ eq7.3 ] ) ) , leading to a very small ( a few % ) change of average @xmath32 , as shown in table [ tabone ] , since the inelastic corrections to @xmath40 are small for a realistic @xmath35 ; see ref . @xcite and references therein .",
    "the physical reason why the corrections are small is that , in a broad range of @xmath41 , the interaction is close to the black limit for all essential values of @xmath34 , so only a small range of ( large ) @xmath41 contributes to inelastic shadowing corrections . at the same time",
    "the color fluctuation effect is large for the variance of the distribution over the number of collisions .",
    "eq.([fl2 ] ) leads to = a(a-1 ) d t^2(b ) , [ avn2 ] and hence the variance is equal to [ varoptical ] _",
    "n -1= d t^2(b ) + 1 -1 .",
    "one can see from eq.([varoptical ] ) that the variance receives contributions both from the fluctuations of the impact parameter and from the fluctuations of @xmath34 . using eqs.([eq7.3]),([avn2 ] ) we obtain for the variance in eq.([varoptical ] ) the value of about 0.46 ( rhic ) and 0.51 ( lhc ) .",
    "numerical values of the different terms in eq.([varoptical ] ) are : 1.26 + 0.20 -1 = 0.46 ( rhic ) and 1.38 + 0.13 -1 = 0.51 ( lhc ) .",

    "( [ varoptical ] ) strongly enhances the effect of color fluctuations .",
    "a more realistic treatment of the color fluctuations taking into account the profile function of the nn interactions and small effect of short - range correlations is possible in the mc model described in the next section .",

    "[ figone ] of having exactly @xmath32 inelastic interactions at a given impact parameter @xmath41 .",

    "( [ psigma ] ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     a comparison of some of the predictions of the optical approximation of the glauber model and the mc calculations , which take into account finite radius of the nn interaction neglected in the optical model , will be given below .",
    "we have seen from the analysis of the optical model that fluctuations in the number of wounded nucleons originate both from color fluctuations and from fluctuations of the number of nucleons along the path of the projectile .",
    "the event - by - event fluctuations of the number of wounded nucleons due to the fluctuations in the number of nucleons at a given impact parameter are present already on the level of the glauber model @xcite . in the case when no fluctuations of @xmath12 are present ,",
    "@xmath44 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq7.3 ] ) . in this case",
    "we can write = ^2 ( 1 + _ ( ^hn_in ) ) , where @xmath45 is the dispersion in the case of no color fluctuations .",
    "we found that @xmath45 drops as a function of @xmath46 , as a consequence of the increasing number of nucleons in the interaction volume . in the calculations we use the event generator @xcite .",
    "this event generator includes short - range correlations between nucleons , however this effect leads to a very small correction for the discussed quantity .",
    "the code also includes a realistic dependence of the probability of the @xmath47 interaction on the relative impact parameter of the projectile @xmath48 , and the target nucleon @xmath49 : @xmath50 .",
    "the probability of the interaction is expressed through the impact factor of the @xmath47 elastic amplitude [ gamma ] ( -_j)=e^-(-_j)^2/2b as follows : p(,_j)=1-^2 .",
    "here we used the exponential fit to the elastic cross section @xmath51 .    in order to perform numerical analyses we follow @xcite , and take the probability distribution for @xmath16 as follows : [ psigma ] p_h(_tot)= exp\\{- } , [ model ] where @xmath52 is a normalization constant and we have @xmath5372.5 mb and @xmath541.01 at lhc energies , while @xmath5332.6 mb and @xmath541.49 at rhic energies .",

    "when converting from the distribution over @xmath16 , @xmath15 , to the distribution over @xmath34 , @xmath35 , we used the geometric scaling observation that the @xmath57-slope of the elastic scattering is proportional to @xmath16 .",
    "so the ratio @xmath58 weakly depends on the projectile and energy .",

    "another quantity which characterizes the effects of spatial and color fluctuations is dispersion of the number of interactions at a given impact parameter , @xmath41 . to illustrate the expected pattern",
    "let us first consider the case of small @xmath41 and large @xmath75 , when the probability of having at least one inelastic interaction is 1 .",
    "in this case @xmath76 , hence the dispersion of the distribution over @xmath32 including both effects can be calculated as follows : [ apprx1 ] = d_in p_h(_in ) ^2 ( _ in)^2(1 + _ ( _ in ) ) .",

    "( [ apprx2 ] ) leads to a dispersion somewhat smaller that @xmath81 .",
    "this is consistent with the pattern we find in the numerical calculation presented in fig .",
    "[ figtwo ] for [ dispersion ] d(b)= , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "one can see that for rhic and lhc energies the dominant effect comes from color fluctuations .",
    "moreover , the two states approximation gives the result which is very close to the calculation with full @xmath15 , so the two states model can be used to simplify modeling of color fluctuation effects .",
    "the large variance of the distribution leads to a much wider distribution over @xmath32 than in the glauber model , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figthree ] .",
    "the figure shows the quantities @xmath84 ; the same quantities are plotted in logarithmic scale in the insets , and one can see that the color fluctuations produce a much stronger large @xmath32 tail . among other things",

    "for @xmath87 we have @xmath88 and this corresponds to @xmath89 fm .",
    "an important implication of the broad distributions over @xmath32 which is mostly due to fluctuations of the strength of the interaction is that selection of large @xmath32 also selects configurations in the projectile nucleon with cross section larger than average . to illustrate this trend within our mc ,",
    "let us consider the average @xmath16 for events with a given number @xmath32 of wounded nucleons . denoting the probability to have exactly @xmath32 wounded nucleons @xmath90 and using eq.([prob04 ] ) , we can write    = 4.3 cm = 4.3 cm    [ prob05 ] = .",
    "the results of the calculation are presented in fig .",
    "[ figfour ] .",

    "average @xmath92 is below @xmath17 , but the effect is relatively small especially for @xmath93 where very peripheral collisions contribute which are not sensitive to the fluctuations . a natural source of large @xmath12 s are configurations of larger than average transverse size .",
    "one can expect that the gluon field is enhanced in these configurations while the distribution in @xmath94  the light - cone fraction carried by partons of the projectile  is softer for large @xmath94 leading to a correlation between the distribution over @xmath32 and distribution over @xmath94 of a hard collision .",
    "= 4.3 cm = 4.3 cm    matching the number of wounded nucleons to the physical observables is certainly a challenging problem in view of fluctuations of the impact parameter in the collisions .",
    "a model independent treatment of this problem would require a study of pa collisions for different nuclei .",
    "still the central multiplicity appears to be a good observable even in the presence of the color fluctuations .",
    "indeed in the soft interaction dynamics the hadron multiplicity for central rapidities , @xmath95 , does not depend on @xmath17 , as it is determined by the density of partons in a single pomeron ladder .",
    "hence the hadron multiplicity for @xmath95 should be about the same for different fluctuations .",
    "also the first studies of the pa collisions at the lhc indicate that to a good approximation the hadron multiplicity for @xmath96 1 gev is proportional to the number of wounded nucleons calculated in the glauber model @xcite .",
    "hence we expect that selecting events with the @xmath97 hadron multiplicities : @xmath98 should select configurations in the projectile significantly larger than average ones ( cf .",
    "[ figfour]b ) with significantly different parton distributions .",
    "correspondingly , a trigger for configurations of smaller than average size would lead to a more narrow distribution in @xmath32 .",
    "one such possibility is to select as a trigger a hard process in which a parton of the proton with @xmath99 is involved .",
    "one may expect that in this case one selects quark - gluon configurations without @xmath100 pairs and significantly screened gluon field , leading to @xmath34 significantly smaller than average and hence a strong suppression of large @xmath32 tail @xcite .",
    "such measurements appear to be feasible using the data collected in the 2013 @xmath0 run at the lhc in which a significant number of events with large @xmath101 should have been collected .",
    "since this kinematics ( for the current lhc detectors ) corresponds to very large @xmath102 s of the jets , one expects that for the inclusive cross section impulse approximation would work very well .",
    "hence it would be possible to avoid issues of the final / initial state interactions and nuclear shadowing in interpreting these data .    a convenient quantity to study these effects",
    "experimentally would be a measurement of the distribution over @xmath101 for different classes of hard collisions at fixed @xmath103 normalized to the distribution in the inclusive @xmath0 scattering .",
    "a large effect is expected for the central collisions where the hard cross section should be suppressed for large @xmath104 and enhanced for @xmath105 .",
    "note that such a measurement among other things would allow to test in an unambiguous way the explanation of the emc effect at large @xmath94 as due to the dominance of the smaller than average size configurations in nucleon at @xmath106 ; for a recent review see ref .",

    "<S> color fluctuations in hadron - hadron collisions are responsible for the presence of inelastic diffraction and lead to distinctive differences between the gribov picture of high energy scattering and the low energy glauber picture . </S>",
    "<S> we find that color fluctuations give a larger contribution to the fluctuations of the number of wounded nucleons than the fluctuations of the number of nucleons at a given impact parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the two contributions for the impact parameter averaged fluctuations are comparable . as a result , standard procedures for selecting peripheral ( central ) collisions lead to selection of configurations in the projectile which interact with smaller ( larger ) than average strength . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that studies of @xmath0 collisions with a hard trigger may allow to observe effects of color fluctuations . </S>"
