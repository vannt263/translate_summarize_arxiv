    "the abc effect is an enhancement of the two - pion invariant mass ( @xmath5 ) spectrum close to threshold that has been observed in certain nuclear reactions .",
    "it manifests itself through a peak at a mass of about 310  mev/@xmath6 with a width @xmath7  mev/@xmath6 .",
    "however , these values change with experimental conditions and there is much evidence to show that the abc is a kinematic effect , associated with the presence of nucleons , rather than being a genuine @xmath8-wave @xmath9 resonance  @xcite .",
    "the effect was first identified by abashian , booth , and crowe ( abc ) in measurements of the inclusive cross sections for @xmath10 at a beam energy of @xmath11  mev  @xcite .",
    "the lack of a similar signal in the @xmath12 case shows that the effect has to be dominantly in the @xmath9 isospin @xmath13 channel .",
    "apart from phase space effects , one would then expect that the @xmath3 component in the production of the abc should be twice as strong as the @xmath2 .",
    "the original abc data covered only production of the @xmath14he in the forward hemisphere with respect to the proton beam direction in the center - of - mass system ( cms )  @xcite . by using a deuteron beam with an energy about twice as high , the acceptance was increased significantly and allowed the abc effect to be observed inclusively in both hemispheres at saclay  @xcite .    in order to discuss data in different kinematic regions , it is convenient to label them in terms of the excess energy @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the total cms energy .",
    "the original inclusive abc data were obtained at @xmath17  mev with respect to the charged pion threshold  @xcite .",
    "exclusive measurements of both the @xmath18 and @xmath19 differential cross sections were carried out at the even higher excess energy of @xmath20  mev by the celsius - wasa collaboration  @xcite and these were complemented by later measurements of @xmath19 at @xmath21  mev by the wasa collaboration at cosy  @xcite .",
    "the data supported the conclusion that at low @xmath9 invariant mass @xmath5 the abc effect was of dominantly isoscalar ( @xmath13 ) nature , though corrections had to be made to account for the pion mass differences .",
    "however , the charged pion data suggested that there could be some @xmath22 contribution at large @xmath5 .",
    "when the kinematics of the full three - body final state were reconstructed , the exclusive experiments also allowed the distributions in the @xmath23he invariant mass to be evaluated .",
    "these seemed to show some reflections of the @xmath24 distribution .",
    "although the systematics were less well controlled , much higher statistics on the @xmath25 reaction at a similar excess energy were obtained by the cosy - anke collaboration by using a deuteron beam incident on a hydrogen target  @xcite .",
    "the difference between the @xmath26he and @xmath27he invariant mass distributions was an indication of some interference between @xmath22 and @xmath13 amplitudes .",
    "it should be noted that , although the set - ups of the celsius - wasa and anke experiments were very different , both sets of measurements were carried out in the forward cm hemisphere between the incident proton and final @xmath14he .",
    "both the wasa and the anke experiment show the importance of the @xmath24 in two - pion production at high excess energies and so it is not unexpected that the results could look rather different at low @xmath28 , _ i.e. _ , below the threshold for @xmath29 production .",
    "nevertheless , there was surprise when the first exclusive @xmath18 results emerged from the cosy - momo collaboration ; these showed that at @xmath30  mev there was no sign of any abc effect  @xcite .",
    "the data were low compared to phase space at small @xmath5 and , indeed , they could be modeled as if there were a @xmath4-wave between the @xmath3 pair .",
    "no comparison of the @xmath31he and @xmath32he invariant mass distributions could be made because , in the absence of a magnetic field in the momo detector , it was not possible to distinguish the sign of the charge on an individual pion .",
    "however , the absence of an abc effect even closer to threshold was confirmed in low - statistics data obtained at @xmath33  mev at celsius  @xcite .",
    "the different behavior between low and high @xmath28 was also noted in the quasi - free production reaction @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a _ spectator _ neutron that was reconstructed from the measurements of the @xmath14he and two neutral pions in the wasa detector  @xcite .",
    "the fermi motion in the deuteron allowed the authors to estimate the cross section for @xmath36 over a range of values of @xmath28 .    in view of the marked differences between the observations for large and small excess energy ,",
    "it was decided to carry out further measurements with the momo detector at excess energies above and below our previous value of @xmath30  mev .",

    "[ setup ] .",
    "one conclusion that is evident from this discussion is that the acceptance for the @xmath37 reaction with a deuteron beam is significantly higher than that with incident protons .",
    "the doubling of the incident momenta leads to generally faster particles that are pushed into smaller angular regions .",
    "the gain by using a deuteron beam is especially important at low excess energy @xmath28 because the cross section falls very rapidly as threshold is approached .",
    "data taken in @xmath38 kinematics are first presented at an excess energy of @xmath39  mev to investigate the anti - abc effect first noted in the momo 70  mev results  @xcite .",
    "estimates of the cross sections for @xmath40 were also made in both these cases by comparing the data sets obtained with and without the @xmath3 detection in momo .",
    "the comparison of charged and neutral pion data indicates that there must be a very significant fraction of @xmath22 production at these energies .",
    "this is consistent with the direct measurements of the @xmath41 and @xmath42 cross sections carried out at celsius at @xmath33  mev  @xcite .",

    "particle tracks were measured in the focal plane by two planes of multi - wire drift chambers ( mwdc ) , six chambers in each plane , followed by two planes of scintillator walls .",
    "these walls allow particle identification via @xmath50 as well as time - of - flight ( tof ) measurements . as is seen from fig .",

    "the numbers denote the different layers and the three boxes at the end of each read  out symbolize the phototubes . ]",
    "the momo detector was placed perpendicular to the beam direction 20  cm downstream of the target , outside a vacuum chamber , the end wall of which was a 5  mm thick aluminum plate .",
    "the detector and its location are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : momo_chamber ] . the central hole , which subtended an angle of 6@xmath56 at the target , allowed the passage of the primary beam and also the @xmath14he that were detected in big karl .",
    "the maximum angle of 45@xmath56 was set by the physical dimensions of momo .",
    "each of the scintillating fibers is 2.5  mm thick but , when operating with a deuteron beam , these were too thin to provide reliable energy information .",
    "the momo wall was therefore complemented by a hodoscope consisting of 16 wedge - shaped 2  cm thick scintillators .",
    "this hodoscope , which is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : momo_chamber ] , was already used in the study of the @xmath57 reaction  @xcite .",
    "the luminosity required to deduce absolute cross sections was measured in two different ways . in the first method , applied in all runs ,",
    "the luminosity was measured with calibrated monitor counters placed in the forward hemisphere , left and right of the target . during the calibration of the monitors ,",
    "the number of scattered particles was compared with the intensity of the direct beam , as measured with scintillators in the beam exit of big karl . to avoid dead - time effects in the hodoscope ,",
    "the beam intensity was reduced by de - bunching the beam between the ion source and the cyclotron injector . for sufficiently small beam intensity",
    "the relation between monitors and hodoscope is linear . in the actual production",
    "runs the counting rates in the monitors was small enough to reduce the dead - time effects to a negligible level . the systematic uncertainty in the beam intensity obtained using this procedure is estimated to be 5% .",
    "combining this with a target thickness uncertainty , that is also about 5% , the total systematic uncertainty in the cross section normalization is conservatively estimated to be below 10% .",
    "the results were controlled by a second method that is independent of the target thickness .",
    "elastic @xmath38 or @xmath43 scattering was studied with two telescopes that measured protons and deuterons in coincidence .",
    "the telescopes , each consisting of two silicon counters , were placed left and right of the target at positions determined by elastic scattering kinematics .",
    "the normalization was then deduced using the cross sections for elastic proton - deuteron scattering taken from the compilation of ref .",
    "the results of the two methods were consistent within error bars .",
    "although , unlike the celsius experiments  @xcite , there was no @xmath58 detector , it was still possible to extract estimates for the @xmath59 cross section by comparing the inclusive @xmath60 cross section deduced from the big karl measurement with that for @xmath61 obtained from the combined big karl and momo data .",
    "however , such a subtraction does depend on precise evaluations of the @xmath3 acceptance in momo .",
    "the acceptance of the overall system for the measurement of the @xmath62 final state is generally much higher for the deuteron than the proton beam .",
    "part of this is due to the tighter forward cone of the @xmath14he detected in big karl but there other important effects of the forward momentum boost , in particular the higher probability that the pions will emerge with angles below 45@xmath56 and thus be detected in momo .",
    "decay losses are also less in inverse kinematics .",

    "@xcite for isoscalar @xmath9 pairs .",
    "the solid ( blue ) curve is for @xmath3 production and the dashed ( red ) curve for @xmath2 . ]",
    "the predictions of the energy dependence of the total cross sections for isoscalar pion pair production in the @xmath18 and @xmath42 reactions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigtot3 ] . given the uncertainty in the model and",
    "the fact that only the @xmath13 contribution is predicted , the estimate of the @xmath105 total cross section is reasonable . the same can not be said for the @xmath42 prediction .",
    "though it is close to the value obtained by the celsius group at 37  mev  @xcite , the curve is over three times too high compared to the momo data at 79 and 101  mev .",
    "the momo values , of course , result from indirect measurements , so that systematic uncertainties may be large .",
    "the only way that a factor of ten between the @xmath3 and @xmath2 production cross sections could arise is if the @xmath22 production were very much stronger than @xmath13 .",
    "if this proves to be the case , the two - step model must have given a gross overestimate of the @xmath13 contribution to @xmath3 production .",
    "new data have been presented on both the @xmath0 and @xmath106 reactions at excess energies @xmath107  mev , where the @xmath14he was measured in a high resolution spectrograph and the charged pions in the momo vertex detector .",
    "though the results obtained are generally consistent , the acceptance of the whole system is much higher with the deuteron beam and these results are much to be preferred . in all cases the differential cross sections seemed suppressed at low @xmath5 invariant masses compared to phase space and there was certainly no sign in the @xmath3 spectrum of the abc enhancement that is so prevalent in higher energy data .",
    "though , as we previously reported  @xcite , the data could be an indication of isovector @xmath3 @xmath4-waves , there are other possible explanations and the behavior could be governed by that present in the @xmath108 amplitudes , where @xmath4-waves are forbidden .",
    "such a model does reproduce features of the observed mass distributions but it would have to be extended to include both @xmath22 contributions and angular distributions before it could be considered a satisfactory theory . of particular importance in this regard is the distribution in the gottfried - jackson angle , where our data clearly prove that there must be contributions from higher partial waves in the @xmath9 system at energies even as low as @xmath33  mev .",
    "the comparison of data taken with and without a charged pion signal in momo allowed estimates to be made for the @xmath109 production rates .",
    "the systematic uncertainties are , of course , larger and direct measurements , such as those achieved with wasa  @xcite , should also be attempted .",
    "the comparison of the current momo @xmath3 and @xmath2 data for @xmath110  mev can only be understood if the pion pairs are overwhelmingly produced with @xmath22 .    for @xmath111  mev",
    "there is a strong abc effect whereas for @xmath112  mev the abc is completely absent .",
    "data are sadly lacking in the intermediate energy interval to show how the abc develops between 100 and 180  mev .",
    "the only quality data that exist in this region were taken in deuteron - deuteron collisions  @xcite and they rely on the spectator model being valid at large fermi momenta . the situation can only be clarified by measurements of free @xmath25 and @xmath113 reactions in this energy range .",
    "we wish to thank the cosy machine crew for providing the high quality proton and deuteron beams necessary for these experiments .",
    "we are also indebted to the big karl technical staff for their tireless efforts .",
    "correspondence with dr perez del rio , who provided the numerical values of the quasi - free data used in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigtot ] , has been most helpful .",
