    "subdwarf b ( sdb ) stars are thought to have masses about 0.5m@xmath0 , with thin ( @xmath1@xmath2m@xmath0 ) hydrogen shells and temperatures from @xmath3 to @xmath4  k ( saffer et al . 1994 ) .",
    "they are horizontal branch stars that have shed nearly all of their h - rich outer envelopes near the tip of the red giant branch and as he - flash survivors , it is hoped that asteroseismology can place constraints on several interesting phenomena .",
    "subdwarf b star pulsations come in two varieties : short period ( 90 to 600 seconds ; ec  14026 stars after that prototype , officially v361  hya stars , or sdbv stars ) with amplitudes typically near 1% , and long period ( 45 minutes to 2 hours ; pg  1716 stars after that prototype or lpsdbv stars ) with amplitudes typically @xmath10.1% . for more on pulsating sdb stars ,",
    "see kilkenny ( 2001 ) and green et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for observational reviews and charpinet , fontaine , & brassard ( 2001 ) for a review of the proposed pulsation mechanism . for this work ,",
    "our interest is the sdbv ( ec  14026 ) class of pulsators .    in order for asteroseismology to discern the internal conditions of variable stars , the pulsation `` mode ''",
    "must be identified from the temporal spectrum ( also called pulsation spectrum or fourier transform ; ft ) .",
    "the mode is represented mathematically by spherical harmonics with quantum numbers @xmath5 ( or @xmath6 ) , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 . for nonradial , multimode pulsators the periods , frequencies , and/or the spacings between them",
    "are most often used to discern the spherical harmonics ( see for example winget 1991 ) .",
    "these known modes are then matched to models that are additionally constrained by non - asteroseismic observations , typically @xmath9 and @xmath10 from spectroscopy .",
    "within such constraints , the model that most closely reproduces the observed pulsation periods ( or period spacing ) for the constrained modes is inferred to be the correct one . occasionally such models can be confirmed by independent measurements ( reed et al .",
    "2004 , reed , kawaler , & obrien 2000 , kawaler 1999 ) , but usually it is impossible to uniquely identify the spherical harmonics and asteroseismology can not be applied to obtain a unique conclusion .",
    "such has been the case for sdbv stars , which seldom show multiplet structure ( i.e. , even frequency spacings ) that may be used to observationally constrain the pulsation modes .",
    "however , relatively few sdbv stars have been observed sufficiently to know the details of their pulsation spectra .",
    "the goal of our work is to fully resolve the pulsation spectrum , search for multiplet structure , and examine the characteristics of the pulsation frequencies over the course of our observations .    in this paper",
    "we report on multi - site follow - up observations of the pulsating sdb stars pg  1618 + 563b ( hereafter pg  1618b ) and pg  0048 + 091 ( hereafter pg  0048 ) obtained during 2005 .",
    "pg  1618b was discovered to be a variable star by silvotti et al .",
    "( 2000 ; hereafter s00 ) who detected frequencies of 6.95 and 7.18 mhz ( @xmath11 and 139 s respectively ) from short data runs ( @xmath12  hrs ) obtained during seven nights , three of which were separated by three months .",
    "pg  1618 is an optical double consisting of a main sequence f - type star ( component @xmath13 ) with an sdb star ( component @xmath14 ) at a separation of 3.7 arcseconds .",
    "the combined brightness is @xmath15 while the sdb component has @xmath16 .",
    "the discovery data used a combination of photoelectric photometry , which did not resolve the double , and ccd data which did .",
    "the combined flux of the double in the former would have reduced the pulsation amplitudes . from spectra",
    "obtained at calar alto , s00 determined that @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "pg  0048 was discovered to be a variable star during 10 observing runs varying in length from 1 to 4 hours obtained in 1997 and 1998 ( koen et al .",
    "2004 ; hereafter k04 ) . as they used a variety of instruments spread over the span of a year ,",
    "k04 were only able to combine two consecutive runs , from which they detected seven frequencies .",
    "however , it is obvious from their temporal spectrum that pulsation amplitudes and possibly frequencies were changing ( their fig .",
    "3 ) . k04 contributed this to unresolved frequencies caused by their short duration data runs .",
    "k04 also obtained an optical spectrum and examined 2mass colors to determine that pg  0048 has a g0v - g2v companion ; though the orbital parameters are unknown and no @xmath9 or @xmath19 estimates were given .    here",
    "we report the results of a new program to resolve the pulsation spectra of these two stars .",
    "section  2 describes the observations , reductions , and analysis for pg  1618b , and  3 the same for pg  0048 .",
    "section 4 compares the results for both stars and discusses the implications for asteroseismology .",
    "pg  1618b was observed from 5 observatories ( baker , mdm , mcdonald , lulin , and suhora ) over a 45 day period during spring 2005 .",
    "data obtained at mdm ( 2.4  m ) and mcdonald ( 2.1  m ) observatories used the same apogee alta u47 + ccd camera . this camera is connected via usb2.0 for high - speed readout , and our binned ( @xmath20 ) images had an average dead - time of one second .",
    "observations at baker ( 0.4  m ) and lulin ( 1.0  m ) observatories were obtained with princeton instruments rs1340 ccd cameras .",
    "data obtained at baker observatory were binned @xmath20 with an average dead - time of one second , while observations from lulin observatory used a @xmath21 subframe at @xmath22 binning with an average dead - time of six seconds .",
    "suhora astronomical observatory ( 0.6  m ) data were obtained with a photomultiplier tube photometer which has microsecond dead - times .",
    "observations obtained at mcdonald , baker , and mdm observatories used a red cut - off ( bg40 ) filter , so the transmission is virtually the same as the blue photoelectric observations from suhora observatory .",
    "observations from lulin observatory used a johnson @xmath14 filter , which slightly reduced the amount of light collected compared to other observations , but does not impose any significant phase and/or amplitude changes compared to other observations ( koen 1998 ; zhou et al .",
    "accurate time was kept using ntp ( baker , mcdonald , and mdm observatories ) or gps receivers ( lulin and suhora observatories ) and corrected to barycentric time during data reductions .",
    "standard procedures of image reduction , including bias subtraction , dark current and flat field correction , were followed using iraf packages .",
    "differential magnitudes were extracted from the calibrated images using momf ( kjeldsen & frandsen 1992 ) or occasionally they were extracted using iraf aperture photometry with extinction and cloud corrections using the normalized intensities of several field stars , depending on conditions .",
    "photoelectric data reductions proceeded using standard whole earth telescope reduction packages ( nather et al .",
    "as sdb stars are substantially hotter , and thus bluer , than typical field stars , differential light curves using an ensemble of comparison stars are not flat due to differential atmospheric and color extinctions .",
    "a low - order polynomial was fit to remove these trends from the data on a night - by - night basis .",
    "finally , the lightcurves are normalized by their average flux and centered around zero so the reported differential intensities are @xmath23 .",
    "amplitudes are given as milli - modulation amplitudes ( mma ) with an amplitude of 10  mma corresponding to an intensity change of 1.0% or 9.2  millimagnitudes .",
    "the companion of pg  1618b adds a complication to the reductions in that data obtained at mcdonald and mdm observatories resolved the optical double , but those from other observatories did not . using our data for which the stars are resolved , we determined that component a contributes 67.3% of the total flux . to correct the unresolved data",
    ", we created a fitting function by smoothing the data over many points ( around 50 points per box ) , multiplying it by 0.673 and subtracting it from the unresolved data .",
    "while this process effectively removes the flux from pg  1618a , it can not correct for the noise of this component , which remains behind . as such , the corrected data are noisier , limiting their usefulness .",
    "multiple - longitude coverage was only obtained during the first week of the campaign .",
    "a total of 73.5 hours of data were collected from three observatories ( mcdonald , lulin , and suhora ) which provided a 47% duty cycle .",
    "subsequent data were obtained only in missouri ( baker observatory ) and arizona ( mdm observatory ) .",
    "these data serve to extend the timebase of observations ( increasing the temporal resolution ) and to decrease the noise in the temporal spectrum .",
    "lightcurves showing the coverage of the first six nights of observations , as well as a portion of a typical mdm run , are provided in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] .",
    "our campaign was quite long ( about 45 days ) with a concentration of data at the beginning , but the best data ( highest s / n and best conditions ) were obtained at the end .",
    "we therefore grouped combinations of nightly runs into the subsets given in table  [ tab02 ] for analysis .",
    "table  [ tab02 ] also provides the temporal resolution ( calculated as 1/@xmath24 where @xmath24 is the length of the observing run ) and the @xmath25 detection limit ( calculated using areas adjacent to the pulsation but outside of their window functions ) .",
    "the temporal spectra and window functions of these subsets are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] .",
    "a window function is a single sine wave of arbitrary , but constant amplitude sampled at the same times as the data .",
    "the central peak of the window is the input frequency , with other peaks indicating the aliasing pattern of the data .",
    "each peak of the data spectrum intrinsic to the star will create such an aliasing pattern . as is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] , the mdm data was significantly better than the rest , so we began our analysis with that subset .",
    "analysis of the mdm data was relatively easy and straightforward . in fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] , the top panel shows the original ft , while the bottom panel shows the residuals after prewhitening by the frequencies indicated by arrows .",
    "the insets show the window function ( top right ) and an expanded view of a 65@xmath26hz region around the close doublet .",
    "frequencies , amplitudes and phases were determined by simultaneously fitting a nonlinear least - squares solution to the data . since during the mdm observations the amplitudes were relatively constant , the solution proceeded as expected and prewhitening effectively removed the peaks and their aliases . the formal solution and errors for the mdm subset",
    "are given in table  [ tab03 ] .",
    "examination of the other data sets indicates that while pg  1618b was well - behaved during the mdm observations , it was not at other times .",
    "this was most noticeable in our examination the data collected during the first week . while the temporal spectrum has the cleanest window function , _ no _ peaks are detected above the @xmath27 detection limit ( 1.53  mma ) even though peaks are detected in individual lulin and mcdonald runs ( see fig .  4 which will be discussed in  2.3 ) .",
    "combining the well - behaved mdm data with any other data set results in a decrease of amplitudes , indicating that outside of the mdm data , the amplitudes , phases , or even frequencies are not constant . if the pulsation properties were consistent throughout the campaign , data collected at smaller telescopes , with low s / n would still have been useful for reducing the overall noise .",
    "unfortunately , such was not the case so all we can really conclude is that the mdm data detected all the pulsations that were occurring ( above the detection limit ) at that time while the pulsations intrinsic to pg  1618b _ must _ have been more complex at other times .",
    "it would be interesting to study the longer - term variability of pg  1618b , but using only 2  m - class telescopes .    outside of the combined data sets ,",
    "there are two frequencies that are detected above the @xmath27 detection limit during individual runs .",
    "the least - squares solutions for these frequencies are provided at the end of table  [ tab03 ] .",
    "the frequency at @xmath28hz was above the noise only in the march 22 mcdonald data , though a peak at the same frequency also appears in the suhora data during march 16 and 21 .",
    "the frequency at @xmath29hz was above the noise only in the april 30 mdm data though corresponding peaks appear in the mcdonald march 18 , lulin march 18 , and suhora march 21 runs .",
    "since they are detected above the @xmath27 detection criteria for those runs , we include them in our discussion that follows .",
    "silvotti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) detected two frequencies in their discovery data while we clearly resolve four frequencies from our mdm dataset , and two more from individual data runs , bringing the total to six independent frequencies .",
    "we calculate the s00 resolution to be 5.5  @xmath26hz and estimate their noise to be about 1  mma though this is misleading in that because of their short data runs , their window function effectively covers all of the remaining pulsations .",
    "however , for a strict comparison , we can say that our mdm data alone are @xmath30 better in resolution and have a detection limit twice as good , though in a practical sense our mdm data are far superior solely based on the duration of our individual data runs . had s00 observed for longer durations ( particularly with their ccd setup ) , their data would likely have been similar to the same number of runs from our mdm set . however , it is clearly safe to say that our mdm data alone are insufficient to describe the complexity of pulsations occurring within pg  1618b .",
    "as such , the remainder of our discussion which is based on the mdm data , can only be a _",
    "minimum _ of what is really occurring .",
    "one of our goals is to observationally identify or constrain the pulsation modes of individual frequencies .",
    "differing @xmath8 components of the same degree @xmath7 have degenerate frequencies unless perturbed , typically by rotation .",
    "if a star is rotating , then each degree will separate into a multiplet of @xmath31 components with spacings nearly that of the rotation frequency of the star .",
    "as such , observations of multiplet structure can constrain the pulsation degree ( for examples , see winget et al .",
    "1991 for pulsating white dwarfs and reed et al .",
    "2004 for sdb stars ) .",
    "for pg  1618b , there are no two frequency spacings that are similar , though there are not many frequencies to work with .",
    "the lack of observable multiplet structure is typical of sdbv stars but is likely limited to four possibilities : i ) rotation is sufficiently slow that all @xmath8 values remain degenerate within the frequency resolution of our data ; ii ) our line of sight is along the pulsation axis , with @xmath32 , leaving only the @xmath33 mode observable because of geometric cancellation ( pesnell 1985 ; reed , brondel , & kawaler 2005 ) ; iii ) rapid internal rotation is such that @xmath8 multiplets are widely spaced and uneven ( kawaler & hostler 2005 ) ; or iv ) at most one pair is part of a multiplet with an unobserved component of the multiplet .",
    "spectroscopy can only rule out large splittings for possibility ( i ) as spectroscopic limits are typically @xmath34  km / s and from fig .  1 of s00",
    ", pg  1618b appears as a `` normal '' sdb devoid of rapid rotation . possibility ( ii )",
    "can only be determined for cases in which the sdb star is part of a close binary such that the rotation and orbital axes can be inferred to be aligned .",
    "since pg  1618 is only an optical double at wide separation , it does not constraint the alignment of the surface spherical harmonics .",
    "similarly , possibility ( iii ) is virtually impossible to decipher unless the star pulsates in many ( tens of ) frequencies , and would still require some interrelation of spacings for modes of the same degree ( kawaler & hostler 2005 ) .",
    "possibility ( iv ) also remains an option , though a difficult one to constrain .",
    "higher resolution ( and perhaps longer duration ) spectroscopy would help to answer this question , and multicolor photometry or time - series spectroscopy might also be able to discern the spherical harmonics ( see koen 1998 and otoole et al .",
    "2002 for examples of each ) .",
    "another quantity that can be used to constrain the pulsation modes is the frequency density . using the assumptions that no two frequencies share the same @xmath5 and @xmath7 values ( except possibly the close pair at @xmath35hz ) , and that high - degree @xmath36 modes are not observationally favored because of geometric cancellation ( charpinet et al .",
    "2005 ; reed , brondel , & kawaler 2005 ) , we can ascertain whether the frequencies are too dense to be accounted for using only @xmath37 modes . from stellar models ,",
    "a general rule of thumb is to allow three frequencies per @xmath38hz .",
    "we will ignore @xmath39 which is too distant in frequency space and count @xmath40 and @xmath41 as a single degree @xmath7 .",
    "this leaves four frequencies within 1235  @xmath26hz ; which can easily be accounted for using only @xmath37 modes . indeed",
    ", even if @xmath40 and @xmath41 do not share their @xmath5 and @xmath7 values , the frequency spectrum can still accommodate all of the detected frequencies without invoking higher degree modes .",
    "of course this does not mean that they are not @xmath36 modes , only that the pulsation spectrum is not sufficiently dense to require their postulation .      if pulsating sdb stars are observed over an extended time period , it is common to detect amplitude variability in many , if not all , of the pulsation frequencies ( eg . otoole et al .",
    "2002 ; reed et al . 2004 ; zhou et al . 2006 ) .",
    "such variability can occasionally be ascribed to beating between pulsations too closely spaced to be resolved in any subset of the data .",
    "however , variations often appear in clearly resolved pulsation spectra where mode beating can not be the cause . for pg  1618b , frequencies @xmath39 and @xmath42",
    "are only detected during a single run each and frequencies @xmath40 and @xmath41 are too closely spaced to be resolved during individual runs , leaving only frequencies @xmath43 and @xmath44 available for analysis of amplitude variations .",
    "figure  [ fig04 ] shows the amplitude and phases of these two frequencies for individual data runs from mcdonald and mdm observatories as well as a single lulin run ( marked by a triangle ) ; these frequencies were not detected elsewhere . during the mdm observations , the amplitudes and phases for both frequencies are nearly constant ( to within the errors ) except for one low amplitude , but they have a significant variation in the mcdonald and lulin data .",
    "of particular interest are the phases and amplitudes of @xmath44 , especially those during day three , in which we have both a mcdonald and lulin run that do not overlap in time . between these two runs ,",
    "the amplitude , which had been decreasing during the previous three days , suddenly increases to begin the same declining pattern again .",
    "the phases also show a bimodal structure early in the campaign with phases near @xmath45 and @xmath46 with the first phase jump occurring coincident with the amplitude increase . except for the lack of sinusoidal amplitude variation ,",
    "this has the appearance of unresolved pulsations .",
    "however , if the two unresolved frequencies had intrinsic amplitude variability , then it _ could _ reproduce the observations .",
    "however the mdm observations , which are not only steady , but have @xmath44 phases intermediate to the mcdonald and lulin data , do not support this .",
    "clearly , during the week of mdm observations , pg  1618b had neither amplitude nor phase variations and since the mdm phases do not coincide with phases from earlier in the campaign , unresolved pulsations are unlikely . since the data obtained at mdm and mcdonald observatories used the same acquisition system and time server ( ntp ) , errors in timing also seem unlikely .",
    "we originally observed pg  0048 as a secondary target during a campaign on kpd  2109 + 4401 ( zhou et al .",
    "those data revealed a complex pulsation spectrum which we could not resolve with such limited sampling and a short time base .",
    "as such , pg  0048 was re - observed as a multisite campaign during fall 2005 .",
    "five observatories participated in the campaign with the specifics of each run provided in table [ tab04 ] . though we were a bit unlucky with weather , over the course of our 16 night campaign we obtained 167.4 hours of data for a duty cycle of 44% .",
    "details of the observing instruments and configurations are the same as for pg  1618b , except for the following : saao ( 1.9  m ) used a frame transfer ccd with millisecond dead - times but only an @xmath47 arcsecond field of view , which resulted in no comparison stars within the ccd field . as such no transparency variations",
    "could be corrected and only photometric nights were used .",
    "tubitak observatory used a fairchild ccd447 detector ; during the first run the images had @xmath22 binning with a dead - time of 102 seconds , while subsequent runs used @xmath20 binning with a dead - time of 29 seconds .",
    "bohyunsan optical astronomy observatory ( boao 1.9  m ) data were obtained with a site-424 ccd windowed to @xmath48 pixels , binned @xmath20 with an average dead time of 14 seconds .",
    "mdm and saao used red cut - off filters , making their responses very similar to blue - sensitive photoelectric observations , while lulin , boao , and tubitak used no filter making their sampling more to the red . as pulsations from sdb stars",
    "have little amplitude dependence in the visual and no phase dependence ( koen 1998 ; zhou et al .",
    "2006 ) , mixing these data is not seen as a problem .",
    "the standard procedures of image reduction , including bias subtraction , dark current and flat field correction , were followed using iraf .",
    "differential magnitudes were extracted from the calibrated images using momf ( kjeldsen & frandsen 1992 ) , except for the saao data for which we used aperture photometry because there were no comparison stars .",
    "as described for pg  1618b , we again used low - order polynomials to remove airmass trends between our blue target star and the redder comparison stars .",
    "the lightcurves are normalized by their average flux and centered around zero , so the reported differential intensities are @xmath49 figure  [ fig05 ] shows the lightcurve of pg  0048 with each panel covering two days .      during the campaign , we completed a `` quick - look '' analysis of data runs as early as possible to ascertain the data quality and the pulsation characteristics of the star .",
    "we noticed early on that the temporal spectra of pg  0048 changed on a nightly basis with pulsation frequencies appearing and then disappearing on subsequent nights .",
    "likewise , we knew that our analysis would be complicated by severe amplitude variations which would limit the usefulness of prewhitening techniques and could create aliasing .",
    "figure  [ fig06 ] shows the effects of amplitude variations .",
    "the full panels are pulsation spectra for three groups of data : all of the data ; data obtained from september 30 through october 3 ; and from october 7 through october 11 .",
    "the right insets are the corresponding window functions plotted on the same horizontal scale . at such large scales ,",
    "the windows appear as single peaks and show that the changes in the fts are not caused by aliasing .",
    "the central insets are individual data runs within the larger set and show the variability between runs .",
    "when sets of data are combined in which the peak amplitudes are not constant , an ft will show the average amplitude .",
    "for the frequencies that appear in only a few runs , the amplitudes are effectively quashed in the combined ft . as pg  0048",
    "is the most pulsation variable sdb star currently known , our immediate goal is to glean as many observables from these data as possible . while we do provide some interpretation , our aim is to provide sufficient information for theorists to test their models .",
    "the complexity of the data meant it was necessary to analyze it using multiple techniques : we performed standard fourier analyses on combined sets of observations to increase temporal resolution and lower the overall ft noise and analyzed individual runs of the best quality data .",
    "the analysis of individual runs represents a time - modified fourier analysis , which is essentially a gabr transform , except that we replace a gaussian time discriminator with the natural beginnings and endings of the individual runs .",
    "as the best individual runs are not continuous with time ( and nearly all are from mdm observatory ) the use of a gaussian - damped traveling temporal wave discriminator ( a standard gabr transform ) would not enhance the results .",
    "the temporal spectra of these runs are shown in fig .",

    "is not a problem and the only constraints are the width of the peaks , which are determined by run length , and the noise of the ft , which is a combination of the signal - to - noise of each point and the number of data points within the run .    frequencies , amplitudes and phases were determined using two different software packages , period04 ( lenz & breger 2004 ) and a custom ( whole earth telescope ) set of non - linear least squares fitting and prewhitening routines .",

    "since 64% of our detections are @xmath62 , our 75 detections is well short of what we should have detected , indicating that the pulsation amplitudes are _ really _ falling below the detection limit .",
    "panel @xmath63 compares the number of actual detections to the maximum pulsation amplitude .",
    "as expected , there is some correlation as the higher the amplitude , the easier it is to detect that frequency .",
    "additionally , the highest amplitude ( and therefore most easily detected ) frequency is the same during 1997 , 1998 , and 2004 ( @xmath64 : @xmath555612.2@xmath26hz ) but is only detected in @xmath65 of our 2005 data runs during which @xmath42 ( @xmath555244.9@xmath26hz ) had the highest amplitudes .",
    "this change in pulsation amplitudes will be further discussed in  3.3.3 .      as in  2.3.1 , one of the best ways to relate pulsation frequencies to pulsation modes is via multiplet structure . with such a rich pulsation spectrum",
    ", it seems likely that some of the frequencies should be related by common frequency splittings .",
    "if not , then the pulsation spectrum is too dense ( discussed below ) for the frequencies to consist of only low - order @xmath66 modes .",
    "there are two different spacings that occur many times with splittings near 972 and 41.1  @xmath26hz .",
    "table  [ tab08 ] lists these frequencies and the deviation from the average spacing between them , while fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] shows them graphically . while the spacings may be important , it is difficult to attach any physical meaning to them .",
    "a spacing of @xmath67hz is far too large to be associated with stellar rotation , as it corresponds to a rotation period of only 17 minutes .",
    "there is currently no high - resolution spectrum of pg  0048 , and the star s main - sequence companion would complicate any attempts to measure its rotation velocity .",
    "however , the typical @xmath68 of sdbs is less than @xmath555kms@xmath69 ( heber , reid , & werner 2000 ) .",
    "if we try to explain this large splitting using asymptotic theory ( consecutive @xmath5 overtones rather than @xmath8 multiplets ) , we would expect successive overtones of the radial index to be roughly evenly spaced for large @xmath5 , with one series for each @xmath7 degree .",
    "but the spacings observed in pg  0048 are irregular , requiring _",
    "eight _ degrees ( one for every line in table  [ tab08 ] ) , and @xmath70 modes have reduced visibility because of geometric cancellation ( charpinet et al . 2005 ; reed , brondel , & kawaler 2005 ) .",
    "theory suggests that sdbv stars should pulsate in low overtone modes and the spacings between successive low overtone modes should differ by several hundreds of @xmath26hz ( charpinet et al .",
    "2002 ) , which again does not match what is observed .",
    "another asymptotic - like relation is the `` kawaler scheme '' which has been recently presented by kawaler et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and vuckovi et al .",
    "though it is not compatible with the low overtone ( @xmath5 ) pulsation theory associated with sdb pulsators , an improved frequency fit can sometimes be obtained using an asymptotic - like formula ; @xmath71 where @xmath72 has integer values , @xmath73 is limited to values of @xmath74 and @xmath75 , @xmath76 is a large frequency spacing and @xmath77 a small one .",
    "however , for the case of pg  0048 , the small spacings are unrelated to the larger spacings and the larger spacings themselves do not interrelate , but rather appear in sets with differing spacings between the sets .",
    "so this scheme is not applicable for pg  0048 .",
    "the smaller , 41.1  @xmath26hz spacings are more akin to what we would expect for rotationally split multiplets , though still large compared to typical measured rotation rates .",
    "if the low - frequency set are all components of a single multiplet , it would require very high degree ( @xmath78 ) pulsations , which are not observationally favored ( charpinet et al . 2005 ; reed , brondel , kawaler 2005 ) .",
    "the same is true for the high - frequency set _ if _ @xmath79 and @xmath80 belong to the same set . since they are separated by @xmath81hz , it is certainly possible that @xmath82-@xmath79 and @xmath80-@xmath83 are just two pairs , but if they are all combined into a single multiplet , it would require @xmath78 again .",
    "yet these could also be just chance superpositions .    since pg  0048 pulsates in so many frequencies , it is important to test the significance of the spacings discussed above .",
    "we did this by producing monte carlo simulations , randomly placing 28 frequencies within 6000 microhz of each other , and counting how often we could detect 14 frequency splittings the same to within about 5% . this criterion would find all but one of the splittings we actually observe .",
    "after analysing over one million simulations , we detected _ at least _",
    "14 splittings in nearly every case .",
    "in other words , the splittings we observe are _ not _ statstically significant .",
    "another tool we can use to place constraints on mode identifications is the mode density . as mentioned in  2.3.1 ,",
    "models predict roughly one overtone ( @xmath5 ) per degree ( @xmath7 ) per 1000  @xmath26hz and though we have detected 28 frequencies , they are spread across nearly 6000  @xmath26hz .",
    "since we do not detect any multiplets that can be unambiguously associated with rotational splitting , it is likely the pulsations are degenerate in @xmath8 .",
    "the average mode density is 4.8 frequencies per 1000  @xmath26hz , which is too high to accommodate only @xmath37 , with degenerate @xmath8 modes and it gets worse as the frequencies are not quite distributed equally , but rather fall into loose groups , enhancing the density locally .",
    "the regions between 5200 and 6200 and 6600 to 7600  @xmath26hz each contains 9 frequencies , and the region from 8800 to 9800  @xmath26hz has 5 frequencies . if all @xmath31 multiplets were filled ( 9 frequencies per 1000  @xmath26hz ) , the frequency density would not require any @xmath84 modes .",
    "however , as we do not detect appropriate multiplets within these frequency regions , the most likely result is that pg  0048 has too high a frequency density to exclude @xmath36 modes using current models .",
    "nearly all sdbv stars show some amount of amplitude variability . however , no other sdbv star has shown variability like that detected in pg  0048 .",
    "an example of this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , where the same 350  @xmath26hz region is shown for the three data sets in fig .",
    "[ fig06 ] .",
    "the bottom two panels are subsets of the top panel , which includes all of the data , and indicate how strikingly the pulsation spectrum changes with time .",
    "we can apply some constraints to the timescale of amplitude variability . since pulsation frequencies can change amplitudes ( even to the point of being undetectable ) between individual runs , and",
    "in particular between runs from different observatories but for the same date , the next step was to divide up our longer data runs into halves .",
    "the fts for six such runs are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] with each half containing about four hours of data . particularly for runs mdm1007 ( which can also be compared to saao1007 ) and mdm1010 , the amplitudes change by factors of two over times as short as four hours .",
    "low amplitude frequencies can easily become undetectable within that time .",
    "figure  [ fig13 ] compares the maximum and average amplitudes detected in individual runs ( the black circles and blue squares , respectively ) to detections in groups of data ( the lines ) from table  [ tab06 ] .",
    "if the amplitudes were simply wandering around between values detected in individual runs , then the amplitude of the combined data would be an average of these values ( the blue squares ) .",
    "however , since the combined amplitudes are significantly lower then the average amplitudes from individual runs , something else must be occurring to reduce the amplitudes .",
    "since changes in phase can impact pulsation amplitudes , we investigated that next .",
    "figure  [ fig14 ] shows phases for eight of the most - often detected frequencies .",
    "@xmath42 is the only frequency detected in every run , and we include the half - night analysis for it . for the other seven frequencies , we only determined phases for those runs in which they were detected above the @xmath27 limit . while fig.[fig14 ] indicates that most phases do not appear constant with time , most are within 20 - 30% of a central value .",
    "to isolate and test the impact phase variation creates on data like ours , we analyzed simulated data with the following properties : the data are represented by a noise - free , single - frequency sine wave sampled corresponding to our 12 best individual runs with frequency @xmath42 .",
    "the amplitudes of each individual run are fixed at the measured values for @xmath42 from table  [ tab06 ] and we assume that _ no _ phase changes occur during an individual run . while the properties of @xmath42 may not be the most representative of the variations detected , it is the only frequency detected every time , and so by using it , we sample the full range of amplitudes .",
    "if we used a different frequency , we could not know the actual pulsation amplitude during those runs without detections , and so would only be sampling the higher amplitude data points .",
    "we created simulations with the following phase properties : no change in phase , a fixed change of @xmath85% from the previous phase , a fixed change of @xmath86% from the previous phase , phases that are randomly set at the beginning of each run , and with the actual phase values for @xmath42 .",
    "the results of the simulations are given in table  [ tab09 ] and the ratios are used in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] where they are compared with our observations .",
    "the last line of table  [ tab09 ] presents results with unique answers .",
    "as expected , there is a correlation between the amplitude and the amount of phase variation in that increasing changes in phase between individual runs decreases the measured amplitude of the data set as a whole .",
    "more useful are the ratios of the average amplitude to the average and maximum of the individual amplitudes ( @xmath87 and @xmath88 ) .",
    "these ratios can be compared with ratios from all frequencies , as has been done in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] .",
    "the shaded regions are the @xmath58 ratios produced from the phase simulations and the circles represent ratios with @xmath89 data and the squares are for ratios using @xmath90 data .",
    "the frequency ordering is the same as for fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] , and like fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] , the results indicate that for all but @xmath42 and possibly @xmath41 , the amplitudes detected in groups of data are too low compared to individual amplitudes . additionally , except for @xmath42 , the phases of fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] ( and their standard deviations given in table  [ tab10 ] ) are in discord with the amplitude ratios in that the amplitudes are too low .",
    "there does not seem to be sufficient phase variation to produce the low amplitudes of the group data .",
    "as such , it seems that more extreme circumstances are required .",
    "however , that leads into a more speculative area which we save for  3.3.4 .",
    "we conclude our observational portion of this paper with a summary provided in table  [ tab10 ] . in this table",
    "we have included all measurables ( not in previous tables ) discussed in this section and some that will be useful for the next section .",
    "columns 2 , 3 , and 4 consider the number of expected detections based on the average significance of the actual detections ; columns 5 through 8 detail amplitudes detected for individual 2005 observing runs ; columns 9 through 12 provide ratios of individual to group amplitudes ; and column 13 lists the @xmath58 deviations of pulsation phases .",
    "can we determine the cause of the erratic behaviour of pg  0048 s frequencies and amplitudes ?",
    "we suggest that , with the possible exception of @xmath42 , the oscillations may be stochastically excited . while this is counter to current theory , supporting observations that we have in hand are 1 ) amplitudes that vary significantly between _ every _ individual run , and in less than @xmath554hrs ; 2 ) the combined amplitudes are significantly lower than the average value indicating",
    "that phases are not coherent on these timescales ; 3 ) the peaks in the fts appear similar to those of known stochastic pulsators ( compare fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] to fig .  1 of bedding et al . ( 2005 ) or fig .  2 of stello et al . ( 2006 ) for stochastic oscillators to those in , for example , reed et al ( 2004 ) for `` normal '' sdb stars ) ; and 4 ) the number of actual frequency detections compared to the expected number based on significance ( the ratio of the two lines in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig09 ] ) .",
    "we note that this is not conclusive evidence , but is suggestive and so we will pursue a stochastic nature for pg  0048 s pulsations in the remainder of this section .",
    "recently , stello et al . ( 2006 ) found that short mode lifetimes in red giants can severely limit the possibility of measuring reliable frequencies .",
    "the difficulty arises because the frequencies can disappear entirely and when they are re - excited ( even if this occurs prior to complete damping ) , they do not maintain the same phase .",
    "the parallel with our analysis of pg  0048 are clear and this kind of variability has been seen before in sdbvs . in a study of kpd2109 + 4401 , zhou et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found substantial variation in the amplitudes of two modes during their 32 night campaign .",
    "a brief analysis found that at least one of these modes , and possibly both of them , satisfied the criterion outlined by christensen - dalsgaard et al .",
    "( 2001 ; hereafter jcd01 ) for stochastically excited pulsations , rather than overstable driving .",
    "the criterion compares the ratio of amplitude scatter to the mean amplitude ; for stochastic pulsations , this ratio should be @xmath91 .",
    "stochastic processes in pulsating sdb stars have also been discussed by pereira & lopes ( 2005 ) in the context of the complex sdb pulsator pg1605 + 072 , which is known to have variable amplitudes ( otoole et al .",
    "2002 ; reed et al .",
    "2007 , in press ) . using the jcd01 criterion ,",
    "pereira & lopes deduced that none of the modes of that star were consistent with stochastic excitation .",
    "however , otoole et al . (",
    "2002 ) noted amplitude changes between years , while pereira & lopes ( 2005 ) only studied 7 nights of data , and as such their analysis was likely affected by the short length of their time series .",
    "a limitation to the jcd01 test is that the damping times of the oscillations should be longer than the timescale used for determining the amplitudes .",
    "our analysis of @xmath92 hour segments of pg  0048 data indicate that amplitude variations are on very short timescales that are shorter than the observing time for individual runs ( see figs .",
    "[ fig07 ] and [ fig12 ] ) .",
    "we provide the jcd01 parameter values @xmath93 in column 7 of table  [ tab10 ] , but we suggest that the jcd01 test is not appropriate for pg  0048 . aside from the jcd01 test , we can attempt to reproduce some of the observational properties using simple simulations with damped and randomly re - excited frequencies .",
    "the complexity of the actual data is such that we can not hope to reproduce it directly , but instead will strive to fit the observations listed at the beginning of this section .",
    "our simulations follow the simple prescription ( equations 2 and 3 ) of chaplin et al .",
    "( 1997 ) summarized as follows : the pulsations themselves are described by sine waves of the form @xmath94 , with the amplitude modified in two ways ; it is damped exponentially as @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the maximum amplitude , @xmath97 is the time since the last excitation and @xmath98 is the damping timescale .",
    "the pulsation is re - excited by setting @xmath99 when time @xmath100 exceeds an excitation timescale ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "the time before the first re - excitation is randomly set to some fraction of the excitation timescale and every time the pulsation is re - excited , the phase is randomly set and the excitation timescale and pulsation amplitude can vary randomly by up to 20% or their original values .",
    "the free parameters of the simulation are the input amplitude , which is the maximum amplitude attainable and the excitation and damping timescales ( @xmath102 and @xmath98 , respectively ) .",
    "the simulation includes frequencies , amplitudes , and phases for up to 100 pulsations with an unlimited number of data runs ( input as run start time , the number of data points , and cycle time ) .",
    "we will concentrate on matching the mdm runs in table  [ tab06 ] .",
    "this is the @xmath90 data set with an average run length of 9.35 hours ( @xmath103 ) , containing @xmath104 data points each , an average detection limit of 0.88  mma , and average ratios @xmath105 and @xmath106 .    to match the observational constraint that the pulsation amplitude can reduce by half in a four hour span",
    ", the damping timescale is necessarily less than 5.8 hours . with this constraint",
    ", we produced a grid of simulations with @xmath107 hours in 1 hour increments and @xmath108 hours in 2 hour increments .",
    "qualitatively , if no re - excitations occur during an individual run , the ft is single - peaked whereas multiple re - excitations create a variety of complex , multi - peaked fts , depending on how similar the randomized phases were ( the less alike the phases for each re - excitation , the lower the overall amplitude and more and similar - amplitude peaks appear in the ft ) . for small @xmath101 ,",
    "the ft becomes increasingly complex with most simulations resulting in many low - amplitude peaks distributed across a couple hundred @xmath26hz .",
    "however , such complex patterns are not consistent with observations and so we discount small values for @xmath101 .",
    "amplitudes in the ft are reduced with large values of @xmath101 and small values of @xmath98 while the scatter increases with increasing values for both .",
    "an increase in amplitude scatter is necessary to produce the low rate of detections .",
    "as we now have all the pieces in place , we can ask how well the simulations reproduce the observational constraints we set at the beginning of this section .",
    "a selection of the results are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig16 ] and [ fig17 ] .",
    "panels a , b , and c of fig .",

    "panels a and d are the results for individual runs and panels b and e are for the combined nine - run data set .",
    "the points represent the average ( @xmath109 ) with @xmath58 deviations while the lines indicate maximum ( @xmath110 ) and minimum amplitudes .",
    "panels c and f show the ratios @xmath111 and @xmath112 ; the average amplitude from the combined data divided by the maximum or average amplitude from the individual runs .",
    "figure  [ fig17 ] shows the expected rate of detections calculated in the following manner : the detection limit was calculated using the observed ratios @xmath113 and @xmath114 for the mdm data with an average detection limit of 0.88  mma and solving for the new detection limit .",
    "the dotted line is the observed detection rate of 26% and it is interesting that none of simulations are that low if using the average detected amplitude . while the overall amplitudes can become quite small , the average follows that , which is used to calculate our detection limit in the top panel . however , most values of @xmath98 matched the observed rate near @xmath115-@xmath116  hours using @xmath110 .",
    "the simulations that best fit the observational constraints are those which have @xmath117  hrs and @xmath118  hrs",
    ". the lower values of @xmath101 better fit the @xmath119 ratios while the larger values are a better match for the detection rate .",
    "these relatively simple simulations are able to fit all of the observed constraints , thus explaining the amplitude variations , their lower detection limits in groups of data , the relatively low detection rate and the appearance of the peaks in the ft .",
    "what they can not explain however , is the relative lack of phase variability in some frequencies ( though relatively few were measurable ) and _ why _ stochastic processes should occur in the first place .",
    "stochastic oscillations are usually presumed to be driven by random excitations caused by convection ( see christensen - dalsgaard 2004 for a review concerning the sun ) .",
    "the he  ii / he  iii convection zone in sdb stars was investigated by charpinet et al . ( 1996 ) , who determined that it could not drive pulsations . however",
    ", it appears that they did not investigate this zone for convective motions but rather as a driver for the @xmath120 mechanism .",
    "so some ambiguity remains here .",
    "there is also convection or semi - convection in the cores of sdb stars , and it is possible that the eigenfunctions could be sampling this region .",
    "whatever the case , the extreme amplitude and phase variability of pg  0048 poses a significant challenge to the iron driving mechanism found by charpinet et al .",
    "( 2001 ) to excite pulsations in sdb stars .",
    "though it is beyond the scope of this paper to ascertain the _ cause _ of the random amplitude variations , we find that the observed properties are consistent with our simplified randomly excited simulations and that the amplitude spectrum resembles those of pulsators that are stochastically driven .",
    "we have carried out multisite campaigns for two sdb pulsators , pg  1618 + 563b and pg  0048 + 091 and in both cases , our observations were superior to the published discovery data , yet questions concerning these two stars still remain .",
    "our mdm observations of pg  1618b ( obtained under good conditions ) show characteristics typical of about half the objects in the sdbv ( v361hya ) class : a small number of stable ( in amplitude ) frequencies with a closely spaced pair .",
    "in contrast , the data obtained at mcdonald observatory  under non - photometric conditions  show pg  1618b to be a complex pulsator with four `` regions '' of power showing amplitude and phase variability . an ensemble analysis of any combinations of data other than the mdm set are hindered by poor least - squares fitting and amplitudes reduced below detectability",
    ". such poor fitting can be caused by unresolved frequencies with intrinsic amplitude variability ( otoole et al . 2002 ) or randomly excited pulsations ( christensen - dalsgaard 2004 ) .",
    "so despite having expended considerable effort to obtain not only multisite , but extended time - base observations , we were only reasonably successful at detecting pulsations from our 2  m telescope data ; and these show the star to be two - faced . with this dichotomy of observational results ,",
    "pg  1618b remains an interesting target for more follow - up observations ; particularly to examine its long - term frequency stability .",
    "pg  0048 is much more complex than pg  1618b , yet it too has shown somewhat stable pulsation amplitudes at one epoch ( the discovery and 2004 data ) and wildly variable amplitudes at another ( 2005 ) .",
    "though an extremely rich pulsator with at least 28 independent frequencies , many modes are only excited to amplitudes above the noise occasionally , often for very short lengths of time",
    ". these behaviors are consistent with stochastic pulsations and we have performed several tests along these lines .",
    "we simulated damped and re - excited pulsations and found that the observations were best matched with damping timescales between 4 and 6 hours and excitation timescales between 13 and 19 hours .",
    "we detected common frequency splittings of 972 and 41  @xmath26hz which may be related to multiplet structure , but could reproduce these using monte carlo splittings of random spacings .",
    "so while they may be intrinsic to the pulsation of pg  0048 , we can not be sure .",
    "we can be sure that pg  0048 s rich pulsation spectrum is too dense to be accounted for using only @xmath37 modes regardless of how many @xmath8 components are present .",
    "the observations presented in this paper provide some very interesting and confusing results .",
    "pulsations that appear stable during some times and variable at others ; attributes that have also been observed in other sdbv stars as well ( kpd  2109 + 2752 , pg  1605 + 072 , and hs  1824 + 5745 , just to name a few ) .",
    "the pulsations in pg  0048 present observables that seem best described by randomly excited oscillations which would be in contrast to the proposed driving mechanism ( charpinet et al .",
    "if validated , it would represent a new direction in sdb pulsations ( and modeling too ! ) .",
    "however , a longer time series may be the only way to clarify the nature of the oscillations in this star .",
