    "according to a widely accepted paradigm , cosmic structures grew from tiny dark matter density fluctuations present in the otherwise homogeneous and rapidly expanding early universe .",
    "the standard version of the model incorporates the assumption that these primordial and gaussian distributed fluctuations are amplified by gravity eventually turning into the rich structure that surrounds us today .",
    "this picture in which gravity , as described by general relativity , is the engine driving cosmic growth is generally referred to as the gravitational instability paradigm ( gip ) .",
    "however plausible it may seem , it is important to test its validity .    in the local universe",
    "the gip paradigm has been shown to make sense of a vast amount of independent observations on different spatial scales , from galaxies to superclusters of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "deep galaxy surveys now allow us to test whether the predictions of this assumption are also valid at earlier epochs @xcite . in particular , they allow us to asses weather gr is the correct theory describing the action of gravity on large cosmological scales ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    indeed ,",
    "modifications to gr have been proposed as alternatives to explain observations showing that the universe is undergoing accelerated expansion @xcite .",
    "non standard gravitational models have also been invoked as an alternative to dark matter @xcite or to its standard physical characterization @xcite .",
    "since these modified gravity theories are specifically tuned to explain the uniform cosmic expansion history , a possible way to test their reliability is to analyze the inhomogeneous section of the universe , i.e. cosmological perturbations of matter @xcite .",
    "it is a non - trivial task , compounded by our poor knowledge of the biasing mechanism , to trace the global matter distribution by its luminous subcomponent .",
    "an operational definition of bias , that is useful for investigating the hierarchical clustering of matter , is conventionally given in terms of continuous density fields , provided that the galaxy distribution is smoothed on scales @xmath1 large enough compared to those where non - gravitational physics operates .",
    "one can thus expand the dimensionless density fluctuations of galaxies @xmath4 at position @xmath5 in taylor series of the underlying mass overdensity @xmath6 at the same point    @xmath7    where @xmath8 are the bias coefficients .",
    "it has been shown that , in this large scale limit , such a local transformation preserves the hierarchical properties of one - point matter statistics @xcite .",
    "the problem of interfacing theory ( mass ) with observations ( light ) stems from the fact that the equations that give access to the value of fundamental gravitational quantities ( such as the @xmath0 of linear matter fluctuations on a given scale @xmath1 @xmath9 or the growth rate of linear perturbations @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the cosmic scale factor ) are also the very same equations that allows us to extract the value of the bias parameters @xmath8 .",
    "since the relevant physical and cosmological quantities are generally degenerate with the bias parameters , it is not immediately obvious how to fix their values .",
    "because of this , the traditional approach consists in assuming that gravitational and cosmological parameters are independently determined to fix the amplitude of the bias coefficients @xmath8 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the viability of the opposite route , that is investigating the coherence of the physical model given an _ a - priori _ knowledge of the bias function , has been systematically explored only recently .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , for example , have proposed to assess the soundness of gr by constructing statistical indicators that are in principle insensitive to the linear biasing parameter , i.e. the lower order term in equation ( [ biasfunction ] ) .",
    "@xcite , on the contrary , tested gr by comparing the observed and predicted growth rate of matter fluctuations using data from deep redshift surveys . to fulfill their goal they adopted the value of the linear biasing parameter provided by independent observations , such as the level of anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background @xcite or the mean number density of galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "both these strategies suffer from the fact that there are now convincing evidences about the non - linear character of the bias function @xcite .",
    "these testing scheme is also far from being economic , requiring data from multiple and independent probes of the large scale structure , redshift surveys , imaging surveys , cmb observations .",
    "an orthogonal , more general approach , aims at extracting from redshift surveys both the value of @xmath2 and the bias parameters @xmath8 .",
    "several authors have shown that , if the initial perturbations are gaussian and if the shape of third order statistics such as the reduced skewness @xmath12 @xcite , the bispectrum @xcite or the 3-point correlation function @xcite is correctly described by results of the weakly non - inear perturbation theory , then one can fix the amplitude of @xmath8 up to order 2 in a way that is independent from the overall amplitude of clustering ( e.g. @xmath3 ) and depends only on the shape of the linear power spectrum .    in this paper",
    "we further explore the potentiality of this approach .",
    "we exploit the information encoded in a different kind of third order statistics , the reduced two - point correlator @xmath13 @xcite . following a suggestion of @xcite we work out the explicit expressions for the bias coefficients up to order 4 as a function of @xmath13 and of the reduced one - point cumulant @xmath14 ( up to order @xmath15 ) . using these results",
    "we construct the central formula of this paper ( cfr .",
    "( [ sigestimz ] ) ) , i.e. an estimator of @xmath2 that is independent from any assumption about the linear power spectrum of matter . as a result , by contrasting the redshift evolution of @xmath2 with predictions of perturbation theory at linear order we can place constraints on the reliability of the gip paradigm and in particular on the viability of general relativity on large cosmological scales .",
    "our formalism relies upon theoretical assumptions and approximations that we have tested using cosmological n - body simulations . in this way we can assess the overall coherence of the method and the impact of potential systematics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  2 , we introduce the relevant definitions and relations that provide the standard framework for understanding the clustering of matter in the weakly non - linear regime .",
    "we work out the relationships between the two - point reduced correlators of galaxies and matter in  3 , and in  4 we show how to use them in order to express the bias coefficients @xmath8 ( up to order 4 ) as a function of observable quantities .",
    "the central achievement of this paper is presented in  5 where we detail the computational scheme that allows to extract both the amplitude and redshift scaling of @xmath2 in real space . in section",
    " 6 we work out the formalism for mapping continuum variables into discrete observables and we show how to implement in practice the proposed testing strategy using simulations .",
    "we also design a strategy to test the coherence of the results .",
    "conclusions and prospects are drawn in  7 .",
    "in this section we give the theoretical background for analyzing the clustering of matter on large cosmic scales as well as the mathematical framework to the model presented in section  3 .",
    "we first introduce our notation and briefly overview the current understanding of the hierarchical clustering of matter in the universe .",

    "cosmological perturbation theory can be successfully applied to determine the evolution of the hierarchy of moments and correlators of the mass fluctuations .",
    "theoretical predictions , however , can not be derived without the prior assumption of a specific , primordial , clustering model .",
    "an interesting , simple and physically motivated case is that in which the initial density fluctuations in the matter component are described by a gaussian probability density functional . in this case , odd moments are zero and all the even moments are completely specified by the moment of order two .",
    "however , even starting with an initial gaussian over - density field , gravitational dynamics induces non - zero higher order correlations already in the mildly non - linear regime .",
    "in particular , by applying weakly non - linear perturbation theory ( wnlpt ) to compute the correlations that first emerges from a gravitationally unstable gaussian field , one finds that , at leading order ( lowest order in @xmath51 ) ,    @xmath52    where @xmath53 are structure constants that do not depend on the scale of the fluctuations , on the initial power spectrum and are almost insensitive to cosmological parameters @xcite .    while extremely useful to characterize the gravitational properties of matter , the one - point reduced moments @xmath53 do not retain information about the spatial configuration of clustering .",

[ biasfunction ] ) into the analysis ,",

    "this imprecision is largely compensated by the fact that our estimator does not depend on any assumption about the nature of the dark matter ( i.e. the specific form of the matter power spectrum ) and it is almost insensitive also to its abundance ( @xmath206 ) .",

    "note that in the lower panel , @xmath342 data are missing on a scales @xmath356mpc .",
    "this is due to the fact that the argument of @xmath340 is negative , i.e. in these extreme cosmological models , the predicted correlation function of the matter density field becomes negative on scales where the corresponding galaxy statistic is still positive .",
    "the horizontal dotted line shows the average of the measurements obtained with our estimators @xmath348 in the _ true _ cosmological model ( i.e. the @xmath213cdm model of the horizon simulation ) and it is reproduced identically in all the panels .",

    "the good news is that the next decade holds even greater prospects for growth of the red - shifts data base .",
    "therefore , we also plan to implement the algorithm to mock catalogs simulating future large 3d surveys such as bigboss and euclid and forecast up to what order and precision the bias coefficients @xmath8 can be estimated , as well as , the figure of merit achievable on @xmath3 and on the gravitational growth index @xmath327 .    from the theoretical side ,",

    "<S> we also design a consistency check to gauge the soundness of the results inferred when the formalism is applied to real ( as opposed to simulated ) data . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that this approach will provide a sensitive probe of the clustering of matter when applied to future large redshift survey such as bigboss and euclid .    </S>",
