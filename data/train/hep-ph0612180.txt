    "the known non - supersymmetric approaches to the higgs fine - tuning problem ( the hierarchy problem ) in the standard model ( sm ) are ultimately based on the higgs degrees of freedom being composite at several tev , either made from strongly - coupled constituents or extended objects such as strings .",
    "this is a theoretically challenging arena where the standard tools of perturbative , renormalizable field theory have limited applicability .",
    "nonetheless , it is important that experiments intelligently stand watch for new tev - scale physics realized in this manner .    in this regard , warped compactifications of higher - dimensional spacetime",
    "provide a particularly attractive setting , for two reasons : ( i ) their geometry can resolve the hierarchy problem non - supersymmetrically  @xcite , ( ii ) when standard model fields are realized in the higher - dimensional `` bulk ''  @xcite , quantities of central phenomenological interest become calculable in warped effective field theory , thereby describing kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations , flavor hierarchies  @xcite , rare flavor - violating processes  @xcite , electroweak precision tests  @xcite , gauge - coupling unification  @xcite , and dark matter  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this scenario incorporates or generalizes key features of other approaches . some of these are extra - dimensional mechanisms , such as tev - scale gravity  @xcite , split fermions  @xcite , and the hosotani mechanism  @xcite .",
    "but there is also a deep equivalence or duality , ads / cft , between this higher - dimensional physics and strongly - coupled , purely four - dimensional physics  @xcite . in this way",
    "warped compactifications connect closely to the ideas of tev - scale strong dynamics , technicolor  @xcite and walking technicolor  @xcite , composite higgs  @xcite , top - condensation  @xcite and topcolor  @xcite , and partial compositeness  @xcite .",
    "calculations in warped effective field theory , while doable , are not easy , and they are certainly very difficult to automate by computer .",
    "the purpose of this paper and its companion , is to provide a simplifying truncation of the kind of warped physics ( with `` bulk '' sm fields ) , or equivalent composite physics , that could solve the hierarchy problem , by describing only the sm particles and the first tev - scale excitations carrying sm charges .",
    "this truncation reproduces the experimentally accessible new physics to good approximation within purely _ four - dimensional _ effective field theory .",
    "calculations are then straightforwardly done using feynman diagrams .",
    "the price of this truncation is that some of the explanatory power of warped compactifications is lost .",
    "enough is retained to show how existing experimental data and bounds are satisfied , and how to identify the least tuned and most promising regions of parameter space .",
    "roughly , the truncation is achieved by `` deconstruction ''  @xcite of the warped theory ( discretization of the warped extra dimension )  @xcite , making it appear as a variation on little higgs theory  @xcite ( for a review see  @xcite ) .",
    "this truncation is very closely related , via the ads / cft equivalence , to the strong interactions approximation known as `` vector meson dominance '' , in particular as expressed in the formalism of `` hidden local symmetries '' @xcite . by this route , our work shares some aspects of the bess approach @xcite to modelling the phenomenology of tev - scale strong dynamics , with however a tighter connection between the new states and the resolution of the hierarchy problem .",
    "similarly , our work also shares some features with the technicolor `` straw man '' models of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the model developed in this paper is the minimal one consistent with the data as well the central organizing principle of _ partial compositeness _",
    "it is closest to the tev - scale physics of the most viable and well - developed minimal warped models  @xcite .",
    "the models of the forthcoming companion paper additionally incorporate a simple and striking mechanism for precision gauge - coupling unification  @xcite , with and without a weak - scale dark matter candidate  @xcite .",
    "our view is that these models reflect grand principles , worthy of the significant challenges they pose to experiments , and that they are a good point of departure for thinking about how to optimize searches .",
    "but even if warped compactifications govern tev physics in nature , it is not guaranteed that any of these models is accurate in every detail .",
    "fortunately , the simplicity of their structure makes them easy to adapt in the face of new experimental facts .",
    "recently , similar deconstructed approaches to tev - scale warped phenomenology have been taken in refs .",
    "the present paper has a similar electroweak structure to that of ref .",
    "@xcite , but differs considerably in other aspects such as flavor structure .    in the next section , we will give a broad overview of the physics , suppressing technical details , concluding with an outline of the remainder of the paper .",
    "let us sketch the central physics and how it is captured by the two physically equivalent descriptions : four - dimensional strong dynamics , and higher - dimensional warped compactification .",
    "we begin with the strong dynamics picture , where the theory is of the form @xmath0 there is a sector consisting of weakly - coupled elementary particles , described by @xmath1 .",
    "there is a second , strongly interacting sector resulting in a host of tightly bound composite states , including the higgs doublet , described by @xmath2 .",
    "the elementary sector couplings are roughly @xmath3 .",
    "the intra - composite forces holding each composite together are very strong , while the residual inter - composite couplings , @xmath4 , are assumed to be weaker ,   but still significantly stronger than the elementary couplings , @xmath5 .",
    "other than the higgs boson , the composites are taken to have typical masses , @xmath6 , of very roughly tev scale .",
    "these two sectors couple to each other via the interactions of @xmath7 , which results primarily in mass - mixing .",
    "consequently , mass eigenstates are non - trivial superpositions of elementary and composite particles .  , @xmath8 , while the orthogonal superposition constitutes the observed light pions .",
    "a pion is predominantly qcd composite , with a tiny admixture of higgs pseudoscalar .",
    "photon-@xmath9 mixing is another example of partial compositeness .",
    "the fermionic example of positron - proton mixing is forbidden in the sm by its accidental baryon - number symmetry , but a small mixing could take place if baryon symmetry is broken by non - sm physics such as grand unification . ]",
    "the lightest mass eigenstates emerging from eq .",
    "( [ l ] ) are identified with the sm fields , @xmath10 where the mixing angles @xmath11 parametrize the degree of `` partial compositeness '' .",
    "the orthogonal admixtures to eq .",
    "( [ sm ] ) constitute the mass eigenstates of the tev - scale new physics .",
    "when the mass - eigenstate particles interact , the composite components interact among themselves with strength @xmath12 , and the elementary components interact among themselves with strength @xmath13 .",
    "this rough rule captures the essence of partially composite phenomenology , which we will further elaborate on .",
    "the warped compactification dual picture of the above physics is that the sm and heavy excitations are interpreted as the kaluza - klein excitations of an extra - dimensional theory , rather than describing them as mixtures of elementary and composite degrees of freedom . in this way the warped picture more naturally works in terms of the mass eigenstates .",
    "it is a deep and at first surprising result that the two apparently very different theoretical descriptions are physically equivalent . under favorable circumstances",
    "the warped picture can give quantitative relations among the most important masses , mixing angles and couplings needed for detailed phenomenology . by comparison , the composite picture gives a clear qualitative understanding of many issues as well , but it is very difficult to pursue phenomenology quantitatively .",
    "the truncation of this paper amounts to retaining just the minimal , lowest - lying set of composite states needed in the sm admixtures .",
    "parameter  @xcite . ]",
    "then , @xmath2 is taken to be a simple effective field theory for these states , while @xmath7 is taken to be the general set of composite - elementary mixing mass terms ( compatible with sm gauge invariance ) .",
    "the mass eigenstates are then the sm states of eq .",
    "( [ sm ] ) and the orthogonal heavy states , @xmath14 this leads to a simple , rough pattern of couplings between the sm and heavy states .",
    "let us consider the coupling strength for any three mass - eigenstate particles to interact , each of which could be a sm particle or a heavy particle .",
    "given the basic rule that three elementary components interact with strength @xmath13 and three composite components interact with strength @xmath12 , one has @xmath15 we now use these results to understand , again roughly , the pattern of mixing angles , @xmath16 , needed in the real world , and the mechanism that has hidden tev compositeness from precision tests to date .",
    "the sm higgs doublet is rather special in that it must be a full composite , with no elementary component , in order to solve the hierarchy problem .",
    "that is : @xmath17 , @xmath18 . from eq .",
    "( [ couplings ] ) it follows that other ( pairs of ) sm particles couple to it with strength @xmath19 , which determines the extent to which they feel electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , and the masses they acquire as a result . from this",
    "we deduce that heavier sm particles are correlated with larger mixing angles .",
    "that is , the heavier sm particles have higher partial compositeness , in the operational sense that they are more strongly coupled to the new tev - scale physics .    in this way",
    "the deep question of the origin of the large observed hierarchies in fermion masses translates in the present scenario into the question of how to obtain large hierarchies among @xmath20 .",
    "it is an attractive feature of the warped compactification scenario that there is a straightforward mechanism for generating exponential hierarchies of just this type .",
    "however , this explanatory power is lost in our truncation , and the mixing angles , and the necessary hierarchies among them , are simply taken as inputs .",
    "this is a trade we make in favor of simplifying collider phenomenology considerations .",
    "the correlation of sm mass and compositeness helps explain why the virtual effects of the new tev physics have not already been seen in low - energy precision tests of the sm , given that electroweak tests are in principle sensitive to heavy physics up to @xmath21 tev and flavor - changing tests are sensitive to heavy physics up to @xmath22 tev .",
    "experimentally , the maximum sensitivity applies to the lightest sm particles , but in the present scenario the lightest particles , such as light quarks and leptons , have highly @xmath16-suppressed couplings to the new composite physics . for flavor physics ,",
    "this safety mechanism generalizes the glashow - iliopoulos - maiani ( gim ) mechanism of the minimal sm . in the appendices of this paper we work out the key electroweak precision corrections due to the composite physics as a function over the model parameter space , so that due consideration can be given to electroweak precision tests .",
    "flavor constraints are a bit less decisive due to the freedom of parameters , but in appendix  [ fcnc ] we illustrate how and to what extent the generalized gim mechanism operates within our model .",
    "( [ couplings ] ) summarizes the challenges as well as the strategy for experimentally searching for the heavy physics .",
    "stronger couplings , @xmath23 , at first seem promising for production of the new physics . but consider the process of fusing light sm partons to produce a heavy resonance , @xmath24    \\propto { g_*}\\varphi_1 \\varphi_2 \\cos \\varphi_{heavy } - { g_{el}}\\sin \\varphi_{heavy } \\ , .\\ ] ] the @xmath4 enhancement is ( more than ) erased by the @xmath25 suppression .",
    "this makes it difficult , but not impossible , to produce the heavy physics .",
    "the challenge will come from seeing these events above background .",
    "once produced , these resonances will mostly decay to the sm states with the largest mixing angles , namely the heaviest sm particles .",
    "the efficiency for identifying heavy sm particles , in particular the top and bottom quarks will be a key determinant of our ability to find the new physics .",
    "but as we will discuss , there are also special opportunities for discovery with their own special features , and these merit further study .",
    "the minimal non - supersymmetric scenario of partial compositeness will be challenging to discover at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , given the regions of parameter space allowed by precision tests .",
    "( the scenario with gauge coupling unification , discussed in the companion paper to this one has more easily accessible physics . )",
    "this is one of the motivations for the present paper : to make the physics as transparent as possible , to motivate hard thinking on overcoming experimental obstacles , and to exploit special opportunities .",
    "it is particularly important to have a practical measure on the parameter space to inform searches of the most motivated regions .",
    "we discuss this next .      in",
    "all known solutions to the hierarchy problem , there remains some tension between the mechanism for solving the higgs fine - tuning problem and the body of direct searches and precision tests , so that in effect one is forced to live with some ( more modest ) residual higgs fine tuning  @xcite .",
    "this fact is often dubbed the `` little hierarchy problem '' . in this paper , we are not interested in tracking the residual fine tuning as a means of passing judgement on our scenario or in order to debate whether or not it is better than others in the literature .",
    "rather , we want to use residual fine tuning to determine which regions of our own parameter space are best motivated , that is , least tuned .",
    "we choose a simple measure of residual fine tuning for this purpose , @xmath26 the smaller the above ratio , the more tuned a model is .",
    "we define @xmath27 to be the largest radiative correction to the _ physical _ higgs mass squared that is sensitive to the elementary sector via @xmath7 .",
    "this has to be cancelled ( tuned ) against the tree - level higgs mass to give the desired @xmath28 .",
    "a useful and elegant feature of our truncated model ( and fuller descriptions ) is that the leading contributions to this tuning are insensitive to the ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff , @xmath29 , and unambiguously calculable at one loop .",
    "mostly , this result follows by simple power - counting .",
    "radiative corrections to the higgs mass squared that are sensitive to the elementary sector must proceed via some virtual fluctuation from a composite to an elementary field and back to composite .",
    "these fluctuations go through the mass - mixing interactions of @xmath7 , which are at most of order of the composite masses , @xmath6 , so that @xmath30 with at most logarithmic sensitivity to @xmath29 . in detail , even this @xmath31 is absent for the dominant corrections in our final model . in section",
    "[ higgs fine - tuning and finiteness ] , the uv - finite fine tuning is simply computed as a function over parameter space .    one may wonder about radiative corrections to the higgs mass entirely originating from the composite dynamics ( that is , not going through @xmath7 ) .",
    "in fact , in our truncated model such contributions are even larger than @xmath27 .",
    "however , we do not count their effect on fine tuning because we expect they would be minimized by extra structure in a fuller description of the composite sector .",
    "the classic example is when the higgs is realized as a composite pseudo - goldstone boson  @xcite , such as the ordinary pion of qcd , or the ads / cft dual description in extra dimensions  @xcite , but there may be other mechanisms as well which deserve further exploration .      the heaviest sm particle , the top quark , requires sizeable mixing angles , @xmath33 . in fact , since the electroweak gauge symmetry implies @xmath34 , and the @xmath35 has already been sensitively tested , we must conclude that this angle is smaller , and , to compensate , @xmath36 is maximal .",
    "( a possible exception is if the composite sector has an enlarged custodial symmetry , a discrete subgroup of which protects the @xmath37 couplings from receiving large corrections  @xcite . in such case @xmath38 can be large and @xmath36 less than maximal . )",
    "maximal @xmath36 not only blurs the physical distinction between elementary and composite states , it also implies that quantum loops involving a virtual @xmath32 result in severe higgs fine tuning . there is a natural way out of this difficulty , namely if the @xmath32 is in fact a fully - fledged member of the composite sector , without any elementary component .",
    "it is then an integral part of the dynamics that produces the light higgs composite , rather than a large outside destabilizing perturbation .",
    "this is reminiscent of top - condensate  @xcite and topcolor  @xcite models , where the higgs is realized as a composite of strong top quark interactions .",
    "this paper gives a truncated model describing the sm and the lowest - lying new excitations , with mass scale @xmath6 , with a parametrically larger uv cutoff scale , @xmath29 .",
    "however , in the full descriptions of warped compactifications or composite models the next - to - lowest excitations typically have masses @xmath39 which are not much bigger .",
    "standard effective field theory power - counting suggests that the truncated description thereby incurs errors of order @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the energy of a process under consideration .",
    "since we want to consider energies large enough to create the first excitations , @xmath42 , we can expect errors of order @xmath43 .",
    "now , it is possible that there is a significant hierarchy between @xmath6 and @xmath39 in warped compactifications , suppressing these errors , if there is suitable structure on the `` infrared boundary '' . in this case",
    "our truncated model could be a rather precise effective field theory where we are simply taking @xmath44 .",
    "however the simplest infrared boundary conditions typically yield @xmath45 , suggesting errors of order @xmath46 .",
    "in fact in these cases there are towers of several resonances with masses @xmath47 , ... , and the combined error from dropping all these higher excitation can be @xmath48 . this rough expectation is borne out by comparison of precision corrections within the truncated model ( as in our appendices ) and warped effective field theory .",
    "this size of error may seem at first sight rather large , but the virtual effects of the @xmath39 and higher states are confined to already small corrections low - energy precision variables or small corrections to non - resonant @xmath6-scale cross - sections .",
    "these corrections are frequently of order the experimental errors or equivalent to shifts in the parameters of the model .",
    "the qualitative agreement , and rough quantitative agreement , between the truncated model and warped compactifications makes the truncated model a very useful `` reconnaissance tool '' for our initial experimental forays into the new physics .",
    "it should be stressed that the truncation procedure we employ for low - lying excitations , essentially discretization or `` deconstruction '' of the warped extra dimension , is part of a systematically improvable procedure where one makes finer and finer discretizations . in practice",
    "this proliferates the number of sectors in the model ( excitation levels ) and rapidly the continuum description becomes more efficient for calculation .",
    "this concludes our non - technical overview of the relevant physics .",
    "the rest of our paper elaborates in a more quantitative way on what has been sketched so far , introducing a minimal model that gives the simplest realization of partial compositeness consistent with present data .",
    "more elaborate models can be built which are even more successful with precision tests ( thus resulting in a lighter spectrum of new particles ) , for example by fully describing the composite higgs as a goldstone boson of the strong dynamics , and assuming a discrete custodial symmetry in the composite sector to relax the @xmath37 constraint  @xcite .",
    "we have however preferred to adopt a minimal realization of partial compositeness , thus favoring slight tunings of parameters over more natural , but more involved , model building solutions .",

    "in this section we define the first building block of our minimal two - site model of partial compositeness : the elementary sector .",
    "its field content corresponds precisely to that of the sm , but with the notable exception of the higgs field .",

    "quite interestingly , the oblique basis of peskin and takeuchi essentially coincides with the elementary / composite basis , apart from highly - suppressed corrections due to the small composite component of the physical light fermions .",
    "this means that the new - physics contributions to these variables can be obtained more readily by using the lagrangian _ before _ mass - diagonalization .",

    "the custodial symmetry of the composite gauge sector is however spoiled at the loop level , since all composite fermions are singlets of @xmath354^{comp}$ ] and their yukawa couplings to the higgs break explicitly the custodial symmetry . the dominant one - loop contribution to the @xmath67 parameter",

    "while our model s defining lagrangian has all explicit couplings and mass parameters with non - negative mass dimensions ( naively a check of renormalizability ) , the model is still non - renormalizable because @xmath370 and the mixing masses explicitly break the composite and elementary gauge symmetries , preserving only the subgroup of sm gauge symmetries .",
    "therefore , the quantum theory becomes strongly coupled in the uv and there is a maximal energy , @xmath29 before losing perturbative control . in this appendix",
    "we estimate this effective uv cutoff on the consistency of our model and show that it is well above the energies we wish to study .",
    "of course , cutoff physics can also appear virtually in precision effects , but these will be suppressed relative to @xmath6-scale contributions by @xmath371 .",
    "the strongest couplings arise from the composite sector , so for the present exercise we focus on this sector exclusively , in particular the breaking of composite gauge invariance due to @xmath370 .",
    "we can always imagine that the composite lagrangian is just the unitary gauge representation of a new higgs mechanism ( distinct from the electroweak higgs mechanism of course ) .",
    "one can `` go back '' to the un - gauge - fixed theory by performing a general gauge transformation , of general form exp@xmath372 , on the composite lagrangian , and interpreting the spacetime - dependent parameters @xmath373 as the eaten goldstone bosons .",

    "latexmath:[\\[\\frac{m_*^2}{2 } \\rho_{\\mu}^2 \\rightarrow \\frac{m_*^2}{g_*^2 }    explicitly non - renormalizable ( gauged ) chiral lagrangian .",
    "the goldstone bosons , @xmath373 , are canonically normalized if we take their `` decay constant '' , @xmath375 , to satisfy @xmath376 we can now use naive dimensional analysis  @xcite to estimate when the non - renormalizable interactions become non - perturbatively strong . the standard result for the non - renormalizable chiral lagrangian is @xmath377 similarly , the un - gauge - fixed composite yukawa coupling is of the general form @xmath378 such a non - renormalizable coupling renormalizes itself ( at two - loop order ) . for the divergent loop corrections to be weaker than the tree coupling , the cutoff must satisfy @xmath379 the implied cutoff , @xmath380 , is subdominant to eq .",
    "( [ uvcutoff ] ) .",
    "we conclude that our model is a weakly coupled non - renormalizable effective field theory up to an energy scale given roughly by eq .",
    "( [ uvcutoff ] ) , which is over @xmath213 tev for the parameter range of interest .",
    "the model we have presented in this paper is the minimal one realizing the partial compositeness of sm fields .",
    "the original randall - sundrum warped compactification model @xcite focussed instead on the presence of observable graviton excitations at the tev scale , needed to realize partial compositeness of the ordinary massless graviton .",
    "we have not included the lightest graviton excitation because the massless graviton is itself too weakly coupled to be relevant at particle colliders and because the more strongly coupled graviton excitation is sm - neutral and less important in the face of so many sm - charged excitations , as in warped compactifications with `` bulk '' sm fields .",
    "the original randall - sundrum model also possessed a light sm - neutral `` radion '' scalar , although its presence is dependent on details of stabilization of the size of the warped compactification , so again we have not included it thus far . moreover , it is not needed to realize partial compositeness of just the sm .",
    "however , both the graviton and radion excitations have interesting properties and may be visible at colliders , and therefore deserve further consideration .",
    "we briefly indicate how they are to be included in the present context .    from the compositeness viewpoint ,",
    "the graviton and radion excitations are pure spin-2 and spin-0 composites respectively .",
    "( there is entirely negligible mixing with the massless elementary graviton . )",
    "they are included in our model by modifying the composite sector and mixing terms , @xmath381 the first line is generally coordinate invariant with respect to a `` metric '' field @xmath382 which houses both the symmetric lorentz - tensor graviton field , @xmath383 , and the radion scalar , @xmath384 .",
    "the @xmath385 terms are minimally coupled to the metric , while the @xmath386 term is the ricci scalar term made from @xmath387 , acting as a kinetic term for the graviton . in this field normalization , the graviton `` planck mass '' parameter of several tev controls the coupling of the graviton to itself and other fields . the second line however breaks the general coordinate invariance , by the graviton `` pauli - fierz '' mass term @xcite , with mass @xmath388 tev , a radion kinetic term ( not coupled to the graviton ) , and a radion potential .",
    "the radion kinetic term appears peculiarly normalized because it also gets a contribution from the @xmath386 term on the first line .",
    "the deconstructed form of the light randall - sundrum graviton excitation was proposed in ref . @xcite . from the compositeness viewpoint it relates @xcite to the strong interactions approach of tensor meson dominance @xcite .",
    "if we turn off all the elementary sector fields as well as @xmath389 , and focus on the composite sector alone , the radion field is coupled consistently with it being the goldstone boson of spontaneous conformal - symmetry breaking in the composite sector .",
    "this is the composite dynamics dual role of the randall - sundrum radion @xcite .",
    "that is , the physical picture is that the composite sector is strongly coupled but conformally - invariant until this conformal - symmetry breaking at a scale @xmath390 , below which the composites are generally massive , but coupled to the massless goldstone boson , @xmath384 .",
    "the radion potential , @xmath391 represents a weak explicit breaking of the goldstone symmetry as exemplified in the randall - sundrum context by the well - known goldberger - wise ( gw ) stabilization mechanism @xcite .",
    "there is a standard subtlety in coupling the ( composite ) fermions to the graviton excitation , in that one can not work in terms of a metric field , but rather must use a vierbein , @xmath392 which is related to the metric field by @xmath393 in standard fashion , both metric and vierbein house the same physical graviton field , plus extra off - shell degrees of freedom , but the ( more cumbersome ) vierbein is useful for covariantizing fermion kinetic terms .    with the above modification of the composite and mixing lagrangians",
    ", the reader can easily derive the couplings of the sm and the sm - charged excitations to the radion and graviton . note that some of the most important couplings of the radion to the sm fields will appear at the loop level .",
    "for example , it is straightforward to check that after mass diagonalization the radion - gluon - gluon coupling vanishes classically , but it is generated via quantum loops of heavy colored excitations .",

    "<S> this is the first of two papers aimed at economically capturing the collider phenomenology of warped extra dimensions with bulk standard model fields , where the hierarchy problem is solved non - supersymmetrically . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario is related via the ads / cft correspondence to that of partial compositeness of the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> we present a purely four - dimensional , two - sector effective field theory describing the standard model fields and just their first kaluza - klein / composite excitations . </S>",
    "<S> this truncation , while losing some of the explanatory power and precision of the full higher - dimensional warped theory , greatly simplifies phenomenological considerations and computations . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the philosophy and explicit construction of our two - sector model , and also derive formulas for residual higgs fine tuning and electroweak and flavor precision variables to help identify the most motivated parts of the parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> we highlight several of the most promising channels for lhc exploration . </S>",
    "<S> the present paper focusses on the most minimal scenario , while the companion paper addresses the even richer phenomenology of the minimal scenario of precision gauge coupling unification . </S>"
