    "stars form from clouds of dust and gas .",
    "as these clouds collapse and conserve angular momentum , matter that is not initially located near the polar axis falls onto a rotationally - supported disk , most of the material that eventually makes up the star falls initially onto the disk , with some matter subsequently losing angular momentum and accreting onto the protostar .",
    "the basic picture of star formation thus involves the free - fall collapse of material from an extended envelope ( or cloud ) onto a disk , and then viscous accretion through the disk and onto a protostar .    at the earliest stages of collapse ,",
    "one would see a roughly spherical cloud with no embedded protostar .",
    "these so - called starless cores have now been identified in a number of star forming regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as collapse proceeds , a protostar and compact disk form , still surrounded by a substantial , roughly spherical envelope .",
    "matter continues to fall onto the disk , while viscosity sources in the disk allow net outward angular momentum transport and inward mass accretion . in time",
    "the envelope completes its collapse , leaving a pre - main - sequence star surrounded by a massive disk .",
    "the disk continues to accrete onto the star , losing mass over time , eventually leaving the central pre - main sequence object surrounded by only tenuous circumstellar matter .",
    "each of these stages of protostellar evolution produces observational diagnostics , and an empirical picture has been developed that links evolutionary phases with properties of the emergent spectral energy distributions @xcite .",

    "the mass of circumstellar disks in each of the evolutionary stages outlined above has crucial implications for star and planet formation .",
    "sufficiently massive disks may become gravitationally unstable , providing high effective viscosities and allowing rapid growth of protostellar mass .",
    "the disk mass at later stages is important to planet formation , since a certain mass is required to build giant planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) from envelopes to disks likely mean that these disks are gravitationally unstable . at the class i stage , envelopes are less massive and the disks may dominate the total system mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . because much of the circumstellar dust around class i objects is expected to be optically thin , the observed millimeter flux is correlated with mass",
    ". however knowledge of the dust opacity and temperature ( as a function of radius ) is needed in order to convert flux to mass . moreover , dense regions ( e.g. , close to the central protostars ) may be optically thick .",
    "radiative transfer modeling of multi - wavelength data is required to disentangle these effects and provide unambiguous circumstellar mass estimates .",
    "historically , constraints on the circumstellar matter in class i sources came from modeling of seds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these models include flattened , disk - like distributions of matter that are a consequence of angular momentum conservation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "imaging data , including scattered light images ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or millimeter images of continuum and line emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have also been used to constrain the circumstellar structure of class i sources .    modeling a single dataset ",
    ", an sed or scattered light image  is subject to ambiguities .",
    "modeling multi - wavelength images and fluxes simultaneously provides tighter constraints on geometry , since emission at different wavelengths arises in different layers of circumstellar material .",
    "scattered light at short wavelength traces low - density surface layers , while longer - wavelength ( e.g. , millimeter ) emission arises in deeper , denser regions .",
    "such modeling has been applied to a number of class i sources , yielding constraints on circumstellar morphology better than afforded by modeling any single dataset @xcite .",
    "previous estimates of disk masses in class i objects cover a broad range .",
    "modeling millimeter images together with seds and scattered light images , disk masses of 0.011 m@xmath3 ( with most masses @xmath10 m@xmath3 ) were determined for a handful of class i objects @xcite .",
    "somewhat lower masses , spanning @xmath1 up to @xmath11 m@xmath3 , were inferred from radiative transfer modeling of sub - millimeter continuum images of 10 class i sources @xcite .",
    "some disk mass estimates are consistent with simulations of protostellar evolution , which find disk masses of @xmath5 m@xmath3 for class i objects @xcite . for many objects , however , estimated disk masses are substantially lower .    for some objects ,",
    "mass estimates place class i disks near the limit of gravitational stability .",
    "this finding would fit naturally into the scenario of burst - mode accretion onto class i protostars @xcite , and explain the discrepant infall rates from the envelope to the disk and from the disk onto the star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in a broader sense ,",
    "the implied gravitational instability provides an easily - explained viscosity source to enable angular momentum transport in protostellar disks .",
    "estimated disk masses in class is appear higher than the disk masses determined for class ii objects .",
    "the median mass of disks in nearby star - forming regions is estimated as @xmath12 m@xmath3 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these disks are about an order of magnitude less massive than the minimum mass solar nebula ( mmsn ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that many stars in the galaxy lack the circumstellar mass needed to form solar systems like ours .",
    "higher inferred masses in class i disks suggest that substantial particle growth ( which depletes the observable population of small dust grains ) has occurred between the class i and ii stages . planet formation may already have advanced significantly during the first million years of disk evolution . given the short lifetimes of particles with sizes of a few centimeters to a few meters",
    "@xcite , this would imply growth of large planetesimals in less than @xmath13 myr .",
    "substantial uncertainties remain in the estimated class i disk masses , placing the conjectures above on somewhat shaky footing .",
    "our aim in this paper is to better constrain the disk masses around a relatively large sample of class i sources .",
    "we will improve upon previous constraints using high angular resolution millimeter imaging from carma .",
    "we model these data together with existing data at other wavelengths , including broadband seds , spitzer irs spectra , and i - band images of scattered light .",
    "our sample consists of class i sources in taurus ( table [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "we selected objects with existing 0.9 @xmath14 scattered light imaging @xcite , spitzer irs spectra @xcite , and well - sampled seds ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "we choose among these the targets whose previously measured fluxes at millimeter wavelengths are @xmath15 mjy @xcite .",
    "we apply this flux cut to facilitate detection and mapping of millimeter emission at high angular resolution (  [ sec : carma ] ) .",
    "however the high fluxes in previous low resolution observations do not guarantee high fluxes in a smaller beam , as extended emission would be resolved out .    while the flux cut applied to the sample may lead to a bias toward higher circumstellar masses",
    ", this bias appears to be small .",
    "the mean 1.3 mm flux density for our sample , as measured by @xcite , is @xmath16 mjy .",

    "the flux distribution of our sources is thus not significantly different than the underlying population of taurus protostars .",
    "iras 04263 + 2426 ( also known as gv tau or haro 6 - 10 ) is a @xmath20 separation binary @xcite , clearly resolved into two sources in our millimeter - wavelength observations .",

    "the binarity complicates the analysis , but also provides an opportunity to study two ( presumably ) coeval sources .",
    "we plan to devote a separate publication to this interesting object .",
    "we obtained images at 1.3 mm wavelengths for our sample using the combined array for research in millimeter - wave astronomy ( carma ) .",
    "carma consists of six 10.4 m and nine 6.1 m antennas . during our observations",
    "the antennas were in the `` c''-configuration , which provides baseline separations between 30 and 350 m. the c array observations thus provide an angular resolution of @xmath21 , with sensitivity to emission on angular scales smaller than @xmath22 .",
    "some of our continuum observations were obtained before the full correlator implementation , and used 2 ghz of continuum bandwidth .",
    "later observations were taken with the full 8 ghz of continuum bandwidth .",
    "a log of observations is given in table [ tab : obs ] .",
    "we used miriad @xcite to calibrate the carma data .",
    "bandpass calibration utilized observations of bright , ( nearly ) spectrally flat sources ( see table [ tab : obs ] ) . to calibrate time - dependent instrumental and atmospheric effects , we observed the blazar 3c 111 every 20 minutes . in between 3c 111 observations",
    ", we obtained data on two or three targets .",
    "because our targets are bright enough to be detected in less than a full `` track '' ( i.e. , the length of time the source is above a reasonable elevation angle ) , we observed multiple targets in each track .",
    "targets in a single track shared calibrators , and comparison of calibrated data for these targets provides a consistency check on the calibration procedure . in a few of the tracks ,",
    "uranus was observed and used to set the instrumental flux scale . for the other tracks we took the flux of the gain calibrator , 3c 111 , directly from the sma submillimeter calibrators page , extrapolating to our observing date when necessary .",
    "baselines with abnormally noisy phases or high system temperatures were deleted . in many cases ,",
    "the deleted baselines included the longest ones , and hence the angular resolution of our observations is somewhat less than the highest resolution possible with carma s c - array .",
    "the longest useable baselines in our data are typically @xmath23 m.    after passband , flux , and gain calibration , we inverted the fourier data and created images .",
    "we also cleaned the images , determined the correct psf for the hybrid ( 6-meter and 10-meter dishes ) carma array , and restored the final images using this psf .",
    "for one of our targets , iras 04181 + 2654 , no emission was detected in the map .",
    "for all other targets , the mapped emission is shown in contour plots in figure [ fig : nirmm ] .",
    "properties of the millimeter images , including peak fluxes , 1@xmath24 noise levels , absolute coordinates , and psf fwhm dimensions , are listed in table [ tab : mmims ] .    while the images are useful for visualization , the visibility data themselves are used in our analysis . because they are the actual data , their uncertainties are better characterized than those of fourier transformed , cleaned images .",
    "we average the visibility data on a two - dimensional grid of @xmath25 and @xmath26 for subsequent comparison with synthetic visibility data from models .",
    "we compute weighted averages in each bin , using the weights output by miriad .",
    "the error in each bin is given by the weighted standard deviation in the mean , scaled by a factor that produces reasonable overall error bars .",
    "we select scale factors so that the error bars are similar in magnitude to the standard deviations in the means of unweighted data . for our data",
    ", we use a scale factor of five for all objects except iras 04287 + 1801 , where we use a scale factor of two .    averaged visibilities for our targets",
    "are shown in figure [ fig : vis ] .",
    "the visibilities computed by averaging over a two - dimensional grid of @xmath25 and @xmath26 are generally quite noisy .",
    "azimuthally averaging these visibilities lowers the noise substantially and allows radial structure to be more easily discerned .",
    "we therefore plot the azimuthally averaged visibility amplitudes as well .",
    "we fit inclined uniform disk models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to the two - dimensional carma visibilities , to provide rough constraints on the geometry of the millimeter emission .",
    "we did not fit a uniform disk model to iras 04263 + 2426 because it is a binary .",
    "the fitted fluxes , sizes , inclinations , and position angles of these disk models are listed in table [ tab : udfits ] .",
    "these fits show that the emission from most of our sample is resolved well in our observations .",
    "however , iras 04166 + 2706 appears to be unresolved , and the data for iras 04169 + 2702 and iras 04361 + 2547 lack the signal - to - noise and @xmath27 coverage needed to constrain the geometry well .      in our modeling",
    "we use keck @xmath28-band imaging of our sample , published previously in @xcite .",
    "we calibrate the astrometry of these images by registering to the 2mass coordinate system . in each of our @xmath28-band images we searched for stars",
    "also seen in 2mass images .",
    "we then computed a plate solution for our @xmath28-band images .",
    "the residuals in these fits are typically smaller than @xmath29 , which is comparable to the error in the 2mass astrometry . for the angular resolution and signal - to - noise of our millimeter observations , we expect positional uncertainties of @xmath30 for the millimeter images .",
    "the registration of @xmath28-band and millimeter images is thus uncertain by @xmath31 .    for",
    "iras 04263 + 2426 we were unable to find enough reference stars to compute a plate solution .",
    "this dearth of reference stars is caused , in part , by the shorter integration time on this bright @xmath28-band object ( 60 seconds , compared to 120300 seconds for the other objects in our sample ) .",
    "for this source we attempted to line up the scattered light structure seen in @xmath32-band 2mass imaging with the structure seen in the @xmath28-band data .",

    "we compiled broadband spectral energy distributions , including spitzer irs spectra @xcite , from the literature @xcite .",
    "we ignore the error bars quoted for these photometric measurements ( when available ) , and instead adopt a uniform uncertainty level .",
    "we adopt 10% errors for all photometric data .",
    "however , this value is somewhat arbitrary . as described in  [ sec : fitting ] , we specify weights for various datasets in our modeling , and these weights effectively overrule the normalization of the internal uncertainties in a given dataset .",
    "following previous work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we consider a model that includes a rotating , collapsing envelope with an embedded , hydrostatic , keplerian disk .",
    "we describe the density distribution of this model in  [ sec : densdist ] .",
    "we use the two - dimensional monte carlo radiative transfer code radmc @xcite to compute the temperature distribution of our models . with the density and temperature distributions computed",
    ", we use radmc to produce 0.9 @xmath0 m images , 1.3 mm images , and seds spanning wavelengths from 0.1 @xmath0 m to 1 cm .",
    "we convert the 1.3 mm images to two - dimensional visibilities over the same grid used to average the carma visibility data (  [ sec : carma ] ) . for ease of plotting , we also azimuthally average these 2d visibilities .    in all of our models",
    "we fix the dust opacities .",
    "we use dust opacities that were computed to fit extinction measurements in dense cores observed as part of the c2d project ( pontoppidan , private communication ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "these opacities are computed for spherical dust grains with a size distribution described by @xcite .",
    "the dust is a mixture of approximately 30% amorphous carbon , with grains between @xmath34 and 7 @xmath0 m , and 70% silicate , with grains between @xmath34 and 0.6 @xmath0 m .",
    "the grains are covered with ice mantles ( 70% h@xmath35o , 30% co@xmath35 ) , with an assumed ice abundance of @xmath36 per h@xmath35 molecule .",
    "changing dust opacities would affect the modeling , but we lack the computational power to vary these in concert with other parameters describing the stellar and circumstellar properties .",
    "we consider three values of source luminosity in our analysis : 1 , 3 , and 10 l@xmath3 .",
    "note that these are rough approximations of the true luminosities of our targets , which may lie between sampled values , but computational resources limit us to a few values .",
    "we take the stellar mass and temperature to be fixed in our modeling : @xmath37=0.5 m@xmath38 and @xmath39=4000 k. these values are compatible with dynamical mass estimates and effective temperature measurements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , we are assuming in our modeling that the only stellar parameter that varies is the radius .",
    "a range of viewing geometries are considered .",
    "we allow models to be inclined between 0 and 90@xmath40 with respect to the plane of the sky , and to have position angles spanning the full range from 0 to 360@xmath40 .",
    "the position angle is defined east - of - north .    in  [ sec : parstudy ] , we present a parameter study that shows how synthetic data are affected by changes in various parameters .",
    "varied parameters include properties of the circumstellar mass distribution (  [ sec : densdist ] ) , protostellar luminosity , and viewing geometry . in ",
    "[ sec : fitting ] , we describe the grid of models we computed , and discuss the procedure by which the best - fit model is found .",
    "our model includes both a collapsing envelope and an embedded disk .",
    "the density distributions of the two components are computed separately and then added together to produce the final model .",
    "we describe each of these components in turn , and demonstrate the effects of changing input parameters on synthetic data .",
    "when a rotating , initially spherical cloud of material collapses , angular momentum conservation leads to a non - spherically symmetric distribution . following @xcite , the density distribution of a rotating , infalling envelope is @xmath41 here @xmath42 is the stellocentric radius , @xmath43 is the mass infall rate , @xmath44 is the stellar mass , @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the angle from the polar axis , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 is the initial angle of infalling material .",
    "the centrifugal radius , @xmath49 , is the location where material becomes rotationally supported against gravity and the density structure becomes less spherically distributed and more flattened : @xmath50 here @xmath51 is the initial radius of the infalling matter , @xmath52 is the angular velocity , and @xmath53 is the envelope mass . in our modeling , we will leave the centrifugal radius as a free parameter .    for each point in the envelope , matter can only have arrived from a specific initial location .",
    "we can therefore solve for @xmath54 .",
    "the particle trajectories obey the relation ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath55 there are three solutions to this equation .",
    "we require that the solution be real and that @xmath56 and @xmath57 have the same sign .",
    "this means that a particle that starts out in one quadrant of the model is required to remain in that quadrant .",
    "the analytic solution is : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is given by @xmath60^{1/3}}{2^{1/3}3r_{c}}.\\ ] ]    we modify this envelope model to include an outflow cavity along the rotation axis .",
    "we specify this cavity as @xmath61 here @xmath62 is the height above the midplane , @xmath42 is the stellocentric radius in the midplane , @xmath63 is the height above the midplane where the cavity begins , and @xmath64 describes the shape and opening angle of the cavity .",
    "for simplicity we fix @xmath65 au in our models , but we explore the effects of @xmath64 and @xmath66 on synthetic data below .    the total envelope mass , @xmath53 , is obtained from the integral of @xmath67 . since @xmath68 ( equation [ eq : rhoenv ] ) , we may use the total envelope mass as a free parameter instead of @xmath43 .",
    "the envelope mass is more relevant for our purposes , since it allows a more direct comparison with the disk mass , @xmath69 .",

    "the scale height above the disk is given by @xmath72 we adopt @xmath73=58/45 , which is expected for a flared disk in hydrostatic equilibrium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this allows us to also fix the exponent of the radial volume density profile to @xmath742.37 based on viscous accretion theory @xcite .",
    "note that this implies that the surface density , @xmath75 .",
    "the value of @xmath76 is similar to assumed values in previous modeling of circumstellar disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and to the inferred value for the protosolar nebula @xcite .",
    "the free parameters for the flared disk are @xmath69 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 .",
    "we assume that @xmath79 .      to produce a disk+envelope model",
    ", we take the envelope model from  [ sec : env ] and the disk model from  [ sec : disk ] and add their density distributions . in our modeling",
    "we vary the disk and envelope masses so that our models encompass both disk - dominated and envelope - dominated morphologies .      here",
    "we vary the input parameters of the disk+envelope model described above , and illustrate the effect these parameters have on synthetic seds , 0.9 @xmath0 m scattered light images , and millimeter wavelength visibilities .",
    "we vary parameters about a baseline model , which has the following parameters : @xmath80 m@xmath3 , @xmath81 au , @xmath82 au , @xmath83 = 0.05 m@xmath3 , @xmath84 au , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 l@xmath3 , @xmath88=45@xmath40 , and pa=@xmath89 .      in our disk+envelope model we have assumed a power - law radial surface density profile declining with radius with an exponent of -1.37 . since the disk surface area grows as the square of radius , the radial mass distribution increases with radius : @xmath90 .",
    "however since the disk outer radius is equal to the envelope centrifugal radius , material in the disk is still compact compared to the envelope mass distribution .",
    "note , too , that the temperature is higher at smaller radii , and the flux from optically thin material can still be centrally concentrated even if the mass distribution is weighted to larger radii .",
    "a higher mass corresponds to an increased mm - wavelength flux .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : mdisk ] , the long - wavelength sed as well as the normalization of the mm - wavelength visibility is increased as the disk mass is increased .",
    "the disk emission is unresolved for our baseline disk model radius ( @xmath91 au ) .",
    "however for @xmath92 au , some disk emission may be resolved on the longest baselines .",
    "the effect of disk mass on the scattered light image is small since most of the scattered light is generated on larger scales where the envelope component dominates .",
    "figure [ fig : mdisk ] shows a slightly less extended scattered light morphology for the highest disk mass considered .",
    "however this may reflect the fact that fewer photons escaped the high optical depth during the radiative transfer calculation .",
    "larger disk scale heights mean that the disk is better at intercepting short - wavelength light and reprocessing it to longer wavelengths .",
    "thus models with higher values of @xmath78 show depressed optical / near - ir fluxes and increased millimeter fluxes ( figure [ fig : hr ] ) .",
    "scattered light images become more compact for larger values of @xmath78 , because photons can be scattered from vertically - extended disk regions at smaller radii .",
    "a larger disk outer radius means more resolved millimeter visibilities ( figure [ fig : rc ] ) .",
    "larger disks also re - distribute mass to larger radii , thus decreasing the optical depth at small radii and allowing more infrared emission to escape . because the disk outer radius is also the envelope centrifugal radius in our model , its effects on the synthetic data are somewhat more complicated .",
    "we discuss how centrifugal radius impacts the synthetic data below .",
    "the disk surface density profile may also influence the observed radial profile of 1 mm emission , since the mostly - optically - thin dust emission correlates with mass .",
    "shallower radial surface density profiles produce more millimeter emission at larger stellocentric radii , and hence more resolved visibilities .",
    "however , in the interest of minimizing the number of free parameters , we consider the surface density to be fixed in our modeling .      increasing the envelope mass increases the extinction toward the central object , thus decreasing the optical and infrared fluxes , and increases the mass of cooler material , thus increasing the millimeter fluxes ( figure [ fig : menv ] ) . unlike the disk mass , envelope mass",
    "is distributed over larger spatial scales , and much of the additional millimeter emission is resolved by the long - baseline carma observations . increasing the envelope mass thus tends to increase the visibility amplitudes more at shorter baselines than at longer baselines .",
    "we see in figure [ fig : menv ] that the effect on the synthetic scattered light images of changing the envelope massis not monotonic . for lower envelope masses , the central object ( protostar+inner disk )",
    "is less obscured and the extended scattered light is difficult to discern against the bright background . as envelope mass increases , the central light is blocked and it is easier to see the extended scattered component .",
    "for still higher envelope masses , scattered light simply can not escape efficiently , and we see the obscured central object at a very low level .    as discussed above , since @xmath93 , a larger value of @xmath49 means that the disk mass is distributed over a larger range of radii .",
    "a larger centrifugal radius also implies that a larger fraction of the total envelope mass is distributed in a flattened distribution .",
    "the millimeter visibilities are thus more resolved for larger values of @xmath49 .",
    "because a larger centrifugal radius means that the more spherical component of the envelope begins at larger stellocentric radii , it also means that i - band emission can escape more easily .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : rc ] , the strength of the scattered light increases with @xmath49 .",
    "we also see changes in the morphology of the scattered light images .",
    "it seems that when the disk size ( defined by @xmath49 ) becomes large enough , scattered light from the disk may dominate the image . for smaller disks , and @xmath49 values , the scattering may come predominantly from the envelope component .",
    "figure [ fig : rout ] shows the effect on synthesized data of varying @xmath94 .",
    "because the envelope mass is held fixed , a larger value of @xmath94 means that the mass is more spread out and the mass on small scales is decreased .",
    "models with larger outer radii are more resolved ( i.e. , display lower visibilities ) .",
    "they also show somewhat lower total millimeter fluxes , since more of the mass is shifted to lower temperature regions .",
    "envelopes with larger outer radii ( and hence less mass on compact scales ) let more short - wavelength flux escape to the observer .",
    "this is reflected clearly in the sed shown in figure [ fig : rout ] . for small @xmath94 values , little light escapes and",
    "the scattered light image shows only highly extincted flux from the central object .",
    "for high values of @xmath94 , flux can escape from the less dense inner regions of the envelope .",
    "for still larger values of @xmath95 , the inner regions of the envelope become sufficiently tenuous that the denser disk component produces most of the scattered light .",
    "the outflow cavity in our models is described by three parameters : @xmath96 , @xmath64 , and @xmath66 ( equation [ eq : cav ] ) .",
    "@xmath96 is not particularly important to the synthetic data and so we fix its value .",
    "@xmath64 and @xmath66 influence both the shape of the cavity and its contrast with respect to the rest of the envelope ( and whether there is a cavity at all ) .    a smaller value of @xmath66",
    ", corresponding to a higher contrast between the densities within and outside the outflow cavity , facilitates the escape of short - wavelength emission .",
    "smaller @xmath97 values lead to more compact scattered light images , since more light from the central disk is visible .",
    "for very large values of @xmath66 , very little scattered light escapes , and we see the central source at a low level ( figure [ fig : fcav ] ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : zeta ] we show the effects of varying @xmath64 on the synthetic data .",
    "while equation [ eq : cav ] describes a curved outflow surface , we can equate opening angles with various values of @xmath64 .",
    "the considered values of @xmath98 , and 1.2 correspond roughly with half - opening - angles of @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 , respectively .",
    "because mass is conserved , larger outflow opening angles ( smaller @xmath64 ) mean more mass is distributed in a flattened density distribution .",
    "this facilitates the escape of short - wavelength emission .",
    "larger values of @xmath64 produce scattered light images with larger offsets from the central object , since the observed line of sight intersects the cavity at larger radii than for smaller values of @xmath64 .",
    "the central luminosity of the model strongly influences the synthetic fluxes .",
    "however , the fluxes do not scale simply with luminosity .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : lum ] , the infrared fluxes increase much more than then mm fluxes as source luminosity rises .",
    "the morphology of the millimeter emission , as well as the scattered light emission , are relatively unaffected by the central luminosity .",
    "viewing geometry dictates whether we see the disk+envelope model through the outflow cavity , through the dense disk midplane , or through some intermediate region . for",
    "more edge - on inclinations , the central regions of the disk and envelope are more heavily obscured .",
    "scattered light is thus more extended and offset from the center ( figure [ fig : inc ] ) . while inclination does not change the size of the millimeter emission",
    ", it does affect the azimuthally averaged visibilities ( since the minor axis becomes less resolved for higher inclinations ) .",
    "the position angle ( pa ) simply rotates the scattered light images .",
    "pa does not alter the azimuthally averaged visibilities , but it does affect the 2d synthetic visibilities actually used in the modeling .",
    "we generate a grid of models and compute the @xmath102 residuals between each model and the combined dataset .",
    "each model takes @xmath103 hour to generate , and so we are limited to a fairly small grid .",
    "we can not afford to vary all of the parameters discussed above simultaneously .",
    "we have chosen to vary @xmath69 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath53 , @xmath94 , @xmath66 , @xmath104 , @xmath88 , and pa . we fix @xmath86 and @xmath105 .",
    "we generated models for : @xmath106,and @xmath107 m@xmath3 ; @xmath108 and 0.15 au ; @xmath109 , and 450 au ; @xmath110 , and 0.1 m@xmath3 ; @xmath111 , and 2000 au ; @xmath112 and 5 ; and @xmath113 , and 10 l@xmath3 .",
    "the inclination and position angle can be varied after the temperature distribution has been computed , and so generating a large range of viewing geometries is relatively inexpensive .",
    "we thus consider all inclinations in steps of @xmath114 and all position angles in steps of @xmath115 in our modeling .    because the weights of different datasets are somewhat arbitrary ( for example",
    ", they depend on number of observed datapoints ) , we adjust the weights to ensure a roughly equal weighting of the different datasets . following @xcite , we divide each dataset by the minimum @xmath102 residual between all models and that dataset : @xmath116 we include additional scaling factors here that we may adjust to ensure roughly equal weights given to each dataset . adjusting these scale factors also enables us to illustrate the constraints arising from individual datasets .",
    "the reduced @xmath102 we adopt is given by @xmath117 where @xmath118 indicates the weighting factor for an individual dataset .",
    "table [ tab : modfits ] lists the best fit model parameters for each object in our sample , and figures [ fig : i04016][fig : i04365 ] show observed and synthetic data for these models . for each object",
    ", we varied the relative weights of different datasets , to highlight the constraints imposed by each set of observations .",
    "changing the relative weights allows us to explore the region around the @xmath102 minimum , and hence to determine how shallow the @xmath102 surface is when projected onto different parameters .",
    "for example , if a parameter is very well constrained then it will remain constant as data weights are varied . in contrast , some parameters may explore large values without significantly affecting fit quality .    in general , several parameters",
    "are well constrained , staying roughly constant as relative weights are varied .",
    "these include @xmath119 , @xmath120 , inclination , and position angle .",
    "this probably reflects the fact that these parameters tend to strongly influence one dataset , and to produce an effect that does not strongly resemble the effects of other model parameters .",
    "the main effect of @xmath69 is on the shape and strength of the millimeter visibilities ( figure [ fig : mdisk ] ) .",
    "while @xmath120 does not directly translate into a flux normalization , its effects are mainly observed in the sed and the normalization of the millimeter visibilities .",
    "since inclination and position angle produce strong , easily discernible effects on the synthetic scattered light images , their values can be constrained well .",
    "in contrast , other parameters explore a wide range of values without significantly changing the overall fit quality .",
    "for example , @xmath95 can vary over the entire range of explored values ( from 500 to 2000 au ) in some cases . to some extent",
    "this reflects degeneracy among different parameters .",
    "as seen in table [ tab : modfits ] , @xmath53 varies in concert with @xmath94 .",
    "this is because larger @xmath94 means that a given envelope mass is divided over a larger range of radii . as described in ",
    "[ sec : parstudy ] , other model parameters may also produce degenerate effects on various synthetic data .",
    "the sparse sampling of our model grid occasionally leads to large apparent differences between models .",
    "in particular we only sample values of 1 , 3 , and 10 @xmath121 for @xmath120 .",
    "fitted values of 3 and 10 @xmath121 for a given source ( e.g. , iras 04016 + 2610 ; table [ tab : modfits ] ) do not necessarily indicate a factor of 3 uncertainty in the source luminosity . rather , this probably reflects that the true source luminosity lies between these values .",
    "this point can be generalized to all parameters in our grid , which are sampled sparsely .",
    "the main goals of our study are to constrain the disk mass , envelope mass , and their ratio . from table [",
    "tab : modfits ] , values for each of these can be extracted .",
    "we compute the average disk mass for each of the four best - fit models .",
    "the median disk mass for all the objects ( using these averages ) is 0.008 m@xmath3 .",
    "the median envelope mass is 0.08 m@xmath3 . for the overall sample ,",
    "the envelope mass is @xmath122 times higher than the disk mass .",
    "another way to describe disk and envelope masses is to estimate the amount of mass on small scales relative to the more extended mass distribution .",
    "this circumvents uncertain interpretations of how much of the mass in our envelope model  which includes some material in a flattened , disk - like distribution within @xmath49should be counted as part to the disk mass .    in figure",
    "[ fig : mprofiles ] we plot the azimuthally - averaged mass distributions for all of the models listed in table [ tab : modfits ] .",
    "it is evident that for most objects in our sample , the majority of the mass is found at larger radii .",
    "this is true even for the disk component , since the assumed surface density profile ( @xmath123 ) implies a radially increasing mass distribution .",
    "moreover , table [ tab : modfits ] shows that envelope masses typically exceed disk masses in best - fit models .",
    "table [ tab : massdist ] lists the total ( disk+envelope ) masses within 100 au for each object and model .",
    "this scale corresponds roughly with the resolution of our @xmath1241.3 mm observations .",
    "constraints on the mass distribution on still more compact scales are uncertain . the mass found in the inner 100 au has a median value of 0.007 m@xmath3 for our sample ( with large variations ) . the fractional contribution of this `` compact '' mass distribution to the total mass varies from 0.03 to 0.44 , with a median value of 0.18 .    even though the mass within 100 au is often a small fraction of the total mass , it produces a relatively large fraction of the millimeter flux ( figure [ fig : fprofile ] ) .",
    "the circumstellar material is considerably hotter at small stellocentric radii . at long wavelengths where emission strength is approximately proportional to temperature and circumstellar mass ,",
    "even a modest temperature gradient can lead to higher millimeter fluxes at smaller radii .",
    "thus our modeling can constrain disk mass and geometry ( as seen in table [ tab : modfits ] ) even if the disk contributes modestly to the total mass .",
    "models of this source generally fit all of the multi - wavelength data well .",
    "however , as seen in figure [ fig : i04016 ] , fitting the positional offset of the millimeter and i - band emission well leads to a somewhat worse fit to the sed data ( third row of figure [ fig : i04016 ] and table [ tab : modfits ] ) .",
    "if we allow our modeled scattered light image to have a smaller offset than seen in the data , we can easily reproduce other aspects of the data .",
    "furthermore , the offset in the model image is affected strongly by the outflow cavity parameter @xmath64 ( figure [ fig : zeta ] ) , and so it seems that tweaking this parameter could improve the overall fits .",
    "our modeling of this source indicates a disk mass of 0.005 m@xmath3 , a disk radius of 250450 au , an envelope mass of 0.050.10 m@xmath3 , a luminosity of @xmath125 @xmath121 , an inclination of @xmath12665@xmath40 , and a pa of @xmath127 .",
    "the disk scale height , outer radius , and envelope outflow cavity properties are less well constrained .    the envelope appears to be relatively massive around this source , with @xmath122 times more mass in the envelope than in the disk .",
    "the ratio of compactly distributed ( within 100 au ) to the total mass is @xmath128 ( table [ tab : massdist ] )",
    ". the large ratio of envelope to disk mass suggests a younger , less evolved object . on the other hand ,",
    "the values of @xmath79 are @xmath129 au , comparable to disk sizes in t tauri stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the disk may be fully formed in this object , despite continuing infall from an extended envelope .",
    "earlier modeling of millimeter wavelength continuum and line data suggested a higher disk mass ( @xmath130 m@xmath3 ) with a more highly inclined ( 6090@xmath40 ) viewing angle @xcite .",
    "however more recent millimeter data has been interpreted in the context of a model including disk and envelope masses close to those derived here @xcite .",
    "analysis of scattered light images also produces geometric parameters consistent with those derived here ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this well - studied object has even been subjected to previous modeling of combined multi - wavelength data @xcite ; again results of this modeling are consistent with those presented here .",

    "our models are able to reproduce well the observed sed and millimeter visibilities . since no scattered light is detected from this source , the model scattered light image morphologies are not terribly important . however",

    "this may reflect the sparse sampling in our model grid to some extent .",

    "less evolved class 0 objects provides a clear path to improving the estimates of the initial mass content of protoplanetary disks .",
    "the range of disk masses observed for our sample indicates that few class i disks are at the limit of gravitational instability .",
    "even iras 04287 + 1801 , which has a disk mass @xmath180 m@xmath3 , may remain stable against gravitational collapse because of the higher stellar mass contained in the multiple central system .",
    "if , however , substantial mass is hidden in larger bodies , gravitational instability may still be possible in these systems .",
    "measured envelope masses can be used to estimate the mass infall rate from the envelope onto the disk , @xmath43 .",
    "estimates of @xmath43 can then be compared to the accretion rate measured from the inner disk onto the star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "such comparisons typically conclude that the infall rate from the envelope is higher than the accretion rate onto the star , suggesting that matter piles up in the disk and periodically accretes quickly in bursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the results presented here are generally compatible with this view .",
    "however the envelope masses estimated here are highly uncertain .",
    "for example , the range of @xmath53 allowed for iras 04016 + 2610 ( table [ tab : modfits ] ) correspond to @xmath43 between @xmath181 and @xmath182 m@xmath3 yr@xmath8 .",
    "much of this uncertainty is due to degeneracies with other parameters ( primarily @xmath94 ; see  [ sec : parstudy ] ) .",
    "additional uncertainties arise because of the limited @xmath27 coverage ( i.e. , range of telescope baseline separations ) in our millimeter observations .",
    "the shortest baselines correspond to linear resolutions of @xmath160 au at the distance to our targets .",
    "more extended emission is largely resolved out .",
    "thus , we are not sensitive to extended emission and , as a result , our total envelope masses are likely underestimated .    despite uncertainties in inferred values of @xmath53 , clear differences in the ratio of @xmath183 are observed across our sample .",
    "the disk - to - envelope mass ratio ranges from @xmath184 for some objects ( iras 04016 + 2610 ) to @xmath185 for others ( iras 04287 + 1801 ) . in most cases ,",
    "the disk - to - envelope mass ratio is around 0.1 .",
    "this suggests our sample is at an earlier evolutionary stage than class ii objects , which are essentially 100% disk .",
    "furthermore , one might be tempted to assign relative ages to sample objects based on @xmath183 values .",
    "another method to constrain relative ages in our sample is to examine the disk / centrifugal radii . for collapsing , rotating envelopes",
    ", the centrifugal radius grows with time because of the inside - out nature of the collapse . for the envelope models used here ,",
    "one expects the centrifugal , and hence disk , radius to grow with time as @xmath186 .",
    "if our sample objects had similar initial specific angular momenta ( which is by no means guaranteed ) , then the inferred centrifugal radii can be used to estimate relative ages .",
    "the disk radii inferred in our modeling have substantial uncertainties , but do reveal trends between objects ( table [ tab : modfits ] ) .",
    "for example , iras 04016 + 2610 seems to have a larger disk / centrifugal radius than iras 04295 + 2251 .",
    "however , iras 04016 + 2610 has a lower disk - to - envelope mass ratio than iras 04295 + 2251 .",
    "while a smaller disk / centrifugal radius suggests a younger source , a larger ratio of disk - to - envelope mass suggests an older object .",
    "we therefore do not place much confidence in our ability to distinguish ages amongst our sample .    to compare our inferred disk masses with expected minimum masses for planet formation theory",
    ", we turn now to the masses listed in table [ tab : massdist ] .",
    "the table lists circumstellar masses enclosed within 100 au , including both disk and inner envelope components . since the inner regions of the envelope have a flattened density distribution ( equation [ eq : rhoenv ] ) , they may appear disk - like , and may contribute to the mass budget for planet formation .",
    "we choose 100 au because this is approximately the smallest scale we can resolve with our millimeter imaging data .",
    "however we would ideally like to probe smaller scales , since planet formation theories usually require a minimum mass within radii or 3050 au ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , even our 100-au - masses ( table [ tab : massdist ] ) may over - estimate the mass available for planet formation .",
    "even so , the masses listed in table [ tab : massdist ] are typically lower than the 0.010.1 m@xmath3 usually required to form planetary systems like ours .",
    "as discussed above , this may reflect growth of small , observable dust grains into larger bodies .",
    "probing younger sources may provide a clearer picture of how much mass is truly available to planet formation .",
    "we described new millimeter imaging observations of a sample of class i protostars , obtained with the carma interferometer .",
    "we presented basic properties of the millimeter emission , and a more detailed analysis of the millimeter data in conjunction with imaging and flux data at other wavelengths .",
    "we constructed models consisting of rotating , infalling envelopes and embedded , compact disks , and generated a grid of synthetic multi - wavelength datasets using the radiative transfer code radmc .",
    "we fitted these models to the multi - wavelength dataset for each target .",
    "our focus in this study is measuring disk and envelope masses .",
    "we found disk masses for our sample ranging from @xmath1 to @xmath2 m@xmath3 .",
    "the compact disks typically only comprise a small percentage of the total mass ( @xmath187 ) , although this percentage is higher in a few objects .",
    "envelope masses  and by extension , the disk - to - envelope mass ratios  are usually poorly constrained by our modeling .",
    "this is due , in large part , to the limited sensitivity of our observations to emission more extended than @xmath188 au .",
    "better @xmath27 coverage , for example combining extended and compact configurations of carma or alma , will alleviate this problem in the future .",
    "the disk masses inferred for our sample are significantly higher than for samples of more evolved class ii objects .",
    "thus , class i disk masses probably provide a more accurate estimate of the initial mass budget for star and planet formation , before particle growth and planetesimal formation lock up mass in hard - to - see larger bodies",
    ". however , such particle agglomeration may already be underway by the class i epoch , and so measured disk masses may still be underestimates . observing class i sources at multiple millimeter and sub - millimeter wavelengths with alma will help to constrain grain properties and how these depend on location in the disk , providing tighter constraints on disk masses and the extent of grain growth .",
    "another obvious extension of this project is to observe larger samples of protostars over a range of evolutionary states . in particular , observations and modeling of class 0 protostars",
    "can reveal if their disk masses are larger than those inferred around class i objects . comparing disk masses for",
    "samples of objects at different ages will constrain how the mass in small dust grains evolves , and give a better estimate of the true initial disk mass distribution .    the angular resolution of our observations",
    "is sufficient to constrain the disk mass distribution within @xmath189 au .",
    "in contrast , planet formation models generally only consider the mass within 3050 au . future work , using more extended array configurations of carma or alma , can reach these scales and provide constraints on disk masses that are directly comparable to critical initial conditions of planet formation theories .",

    "<S> one of the 9 is resolved into two sources , and detailed analysis of this binary protostellar system is deferred to a future paper . for the remaining 8 objects , we use the carma data to determine the basic morphology of the millimeter emission . combining the millimeter data with 0.9 @xmath0 m images of scattered light , spitzer irs spectra , and broadband seds ( all from the literature ) </S>",
    "<S> , we attempt to determine the structure of the circumstellar material . </S>",
    "<S> we consider models including both circumstellar disks and envelopes , and constrain the masses ( and other structural parameters ) of each of these components . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the disk masses in our sample span a range from @xmath1 to @xmath2 m@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the disk masses for our sample are significantly higher than for samples of more evolved class ii objects . </S>",
    "<S> thus , class i disk masses probably provide a more accurate estimate of the initial mass budget for star and planet formation . </S>",
    "<S> however , the disk masses determined here are lower than required by theories of giant planet formation . the masses also appear too low for gravitational instability , which could lead to high mass accretion rates . even in these class </S>",
    "<S> i disks , substantial particle growth may have hidden much of the disk mass in hard - to - see larger bodies . </S>"
