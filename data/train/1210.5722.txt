    "there are many geometrically defined operations in open - closed string topology .",
    "see @xcite , for example .",
    "some of them pass to homology , while others have boundary terms ( or  anomalies \" ) and do not . in @xcite and @xcite , the splitting of closed strings",
    "has an anomaly which is canceled by working modulo constant strings .",
    "we do not apply this to the splitting of open strings because the unit of the combining operation is made of constant strings .",
    "still , we desire to remove this anomaly for several reasons which will be explained in this note and others @xcite .",
    "we treat the anomaly for splitting , which occurs in  traditional \" ( universal ) string topology , by passing to the subset of open strings which are transverse to the submanifold .",
    "we call the resulting theory * transverse string topology * to distinguish it from the well - studied universal string topology .",
    "this is a drastic change in perspective because the algebraic topology of the space of strings changes in a subtle way .",
    "the value of doing this was motivated by the desire to relate this structure on open strings for classical knots to the ng cord algebra defined in @xcite . as noted independently by different people ,",
    "one of the defining relations of the ng cord algebra resembles a relation related to splitting open strings .    indeed , splitting transverse open strings defines a differential coalgebra structure where the differential has two pieces : an internal boundary operator ( without anomaly ) ; and a term which resolves the concatenation of two open strings which do not intersect the submanifold in their interiors .",
    "this term can be recognized via the bar construction for a partially - defined combining operation on such open strings .",
    "our main result in this note , which we restate more precisely as theorem [ maintheorem.thm ] , is the following :    [ thmintro ] the zeroth homology of the cobar construction on the coalgebra of vertically transverse open strings , relative to a cross section of the normal bundle , determines a ring isomorphic to a specialization of ng s cord algebra .",
    "the isomorphism is as algebras over the group ring of an infinite cyclic group .",
    "in @xcite ng shows that the cord algebra is a powerful knot invariant . combining the isomorphism of theorem [ thmintro ] with his results we find the following :    [ ngcomputation.cor ] the operations on ( transverse ) open strings defines a non - trivial knot invariant not determined by any of the following : alexander polynomial , jones polynomial , homfly polynomial , kauffman polynomial , signature , khovanov invariant , and ozsvath - szabo invariant .",
    "this follows from our main result , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 8.4 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 4.3 ) .",
    "one way to understand what is really going on here is based on @xcite .",
    "that thesis defines the partial multiplication alluded to above from a categorical perspective where the ( cobar construction ) of ( bar construction ) is an equivalence .",
    "this allows one to interpret the cobar of the open string coalgebra , in terms of an algebraic construction , as a twisted pontrjagin ring of the based loop space of the complement . in the case of knots",
    "( in @xmath2 ) this can be realized as a version of the ng cord algebra . as an application of the theory developed in the thesis ,",
    "the transverse string topology in @xcite distinguishes two homotopic but non - homeomorphic lens spaces .",
    "this explanation itself was motivated in two ways by @xcite .",
    "first , that thesis made use of a cobar of the coalgebra for a specific set of open strings . secondly , that construction required transversality , which was already known to remove the internal anomaly and to make the partial algebra structure possible .",
    "the thesis goes on to recover the cord algebra , as well as higher degrees of relative contact homology ( for @xmath3-coefficients ) .",
    "the cord algebra is isomorphic to a particular version of relative contact homology defined using pseudo - holomorphic disks @xcite .",
    "when there is no submanifold , a morphism between a similar contact homology and a closed string topology theory was introduced in @xcite . this morphism is natural in that it comes from geometry .",
    "a relative version of this morphism has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "we would like to emphasize that we do not assume that  the information of the complement \" is directly given to us .",
    "rather , we derive what we need from the transverse open strings . with this point of view but from a different perspective",
    ", @xcite via a cyclic hochschild construction proves that transverse string topology of the knot recovers the bracket ( and other information ) on the equivariant loop space of the complement . via @xcite , this information is enough to recover the seifert and hyperbolic graph structure of the jsj - decomposition @xcite of the complement .",
    "hence transverse string topology again provides non - trivial knot invariants .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ transversestringtopology.sec ]",
    "we review our version of transverse string topology and define the string algebra @xmath4 via the homology of its cobar . in section [ ng.sec ]",
