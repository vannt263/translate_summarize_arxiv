    "after that we shall present michel s theories and point out how it could help us finding stationary states @xcite .",
    "the michel s theorem ensures us that there have to exist so - called inert - states .",
    "their name comes from a fact that they remain stationary for every values of hamiltonian s parameters ( such as external magnetic field , density etc . ) .",

    "all inert states for spin @xmath6 condensates and some inert states for higher spins have been presented in the literature @xcite .",

    "we should remember that usually in spinor bose - einstein condensates description by @xmath4 we understand total angular momentum of all electrons and nuclei of atom which we will just call spin .",

    "can be decomposed into kinetic energy , energy of zeeman effects ( linear and quadratic ) and interaction energy .",
    "so we can write : @xmath12 where by @xmath13 we understand part of hamiltonian without interaction between particles .",
    "assuming the direction of external magnetic field @xmath14 along the @xmath15-axis it can be decomposed as follows : @xmath16\\hat{\\psi}_{m_2}(\\vec{r})\\ ; ,   \\label{eq : hamigoly1}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is mass of atoms , @xmath18 factor describes the linear zeeman effect , @xmath19 factor describes the quadratic zeeman effect and @xmath20 is spin matrix ( in the chosen coordinates system it is diagonal @xmath21 ) .    in dilute and ultra - cold atomic gases two - body @xmath3-wave interaction channels",
    "are important only . from wave function s symmetry considerations",
    "we can find out that the only possible channels for identical bosons correspond to even values of total spin @xmath22 of two interacting particles .",
    "so the interaction part of the hamiltonian can be decomposed in the following way @xmath23 we can construct ( using clebsh - gordon coefficients ) operators which annihilate pairs of bosons with total angular momentum @xmath22 and its projection @xmath24 on the @xmath15-axis @xmath25 now we can see that operators @xmath26 can be written as : @xmath27 function @xmath28 describes spatial dependence of interactions between two particles in the channel @xmath22 .",

    "we assume also that the spinor and spatial parts of the wave - function factorize , i.e. @xmath36 . in the absence of an external trapping potential",

    "functions used in ( [ eq : ennaczastke ] ) have the following forms @xmath48    @xmath49    in order to calculate all stationary states of the energy ( [ eq : ennaczastke ] ) one has to derive the corresponding euler - lagrange equations and solve them which usually has to be done numerically .",
    "however , a certain class of stationary states can be found analytically by consideration of symmetries of the system .",
    "these are the so - called inert - states which we present in the following sections .",
    "michel s theorem allows us to find special stationary states .",
    "they are called inert - states because they are stationary for any values of hamiltonian s parameters ( in our case the parameters are : particle density , scattering lengths and external magnetic field ) .",

    "meaning of the part @xmath52 is the same , i.e. it is the global phase changing symmetry , whereas @xmath54 is group of rotations in 3-dimensional space .    for our further considerations we should call symmetry group by @xmath55 and by @xmath56 function defined in a finite - dimensional smooth domain @xmath57 which has this symmetry . by orbit @xmath58 of point @xmath59",
    "we understand set of points being results of action of all group elements on point @xmath59 @xmath60 isotropy group of point @xmath59 is a set of group elements which act on @xmath59 as an identity element @xmath61 we say that any two isotropy groups are conjugate if @xmath62 stratum is union of all orbits of points whose isotropy groups are conjugate @xmath63 we say that an orbit is isolated in its stratum if there exists neighborhood of this orbit @xmath64 so that its intersection with stratum gives that orbit @xmath65 michel proved following theorem .",

    "we know that for our spinor condensate system we are able to find some stationary points @xmath59 just by finding isolated orbits .",
    "the crucial point of the michel s theorem proof is to show that gradient of function @xmath56 is a vector which is tangential to the stratum .",
    "we know from definition of orbit that gradient of function is orthogonal to the orbit . and if any orbit is isolated in its stratum we know that gradient has to be null on it so this orbit has to be extremal ( minimal , maximal or saddle ) point .",

    "@xcite showed how to translate symmetries of spin-@xmath4 states @xmath67 into symmetries of a polyhedron with @xmath2 vertices .",

    "we have to find a set of maximally polarized states , i.e. @xmath68 , which are orthogonal to @xmath69 , @xmath70 the states @xmath71 can be parameterized as @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 denote position of vertices of a polyhedron on the unit sphere . for our considerations",
    "the most important corollary is that maximal number of found vertices is equal to @xmath2 because eq .",
    "( [ eq : deml1 ] ) is actually a polynomial equation of the @xmath2 degree .",
    "therefore when we are looking for inert - states of the system we may consider only these point group whose corresponding regular polyhedron has no more than @xmath2 vortices .",
    "now we should present way of calculating and finding inert - states @xcite . in order to do that we should go through all subgroups of a global symmetry group of a system . for each subgroup we should find states which are invariant under this subgroup . in that case",
    "this subgroup is their isotropy group .",
    "first we will show how to calculate inert - states for subgroups with only one generator . in our case",
    "such generators have form @xmath75 ( i.e. they are rotation operator about @xmath76-axis by an angle @xmath73 ) .",
    "it is worth pointing out that if @xmath77 belongs to the symmetry group of the system so is @xmath78 because in our case the symmetry group of the system is a direct product of a rotation group and the global phase changing symmetry group .",
    "all eigenvalues of @xmath77 can be written as @xmath79 . if we find all eigenvectors of a generator @xmath77 we can identify some of them to be inert - states . through eigensubspaces of @xmath77",
    "we should choose these which are non - degenerate .",
    "that means that for each eigenvalue @xmath79 there exists only one eigenvector @xmath80 .",
    "therefore we know that group generated by @xmath81 is isotropy group of this vector .",
    "moreover we see that there is only one orbit whose isotropy group is this group .",
    "thus , this orbit must be isolated in its stratum because stratum consists of this orbit only .",
    "then , the michel theorem tells us @xmath80 is an inert - state .",
    "if some subgroup has two or more generators , as in the case of point groups , we ought to find vectors which are common eigenvectors for all generators .",
    "if there is only one common eigenvector it is an inert - state of the system .",
    "when on the other hand the common eigenspace is not one - dimensional we still can calculate stationary states which are not inert - states . to this end",
    "we have to find extrema of the energy of the system within the common eigensubspace .",
