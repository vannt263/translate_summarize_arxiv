    "the purpose of this section is to fix notation and our general viewpoint . for simplicity ,",
    "let us start with a classical system on a finite - dimensional affine space @xmath5 with its coordinate space @xmath6 .",
    "in reference to a chosen probability measure @xmath7 on @xmath5 , a polynomial algebra @xmath8 on @xmath6 generates a sequence of function spaces , @xmath9 , similar to the gelfand triplet , where @xmath10 denotes the half measure @xcite corresponding to @xmath7 . the inner product of @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 . by @xmath13 a duality relation @xmath14 holds .",
    "hence we have @xmath15",
    ".    then a self - dual algebra @xmath16 is defined by @xmath17 which has a canonical choice of a state determined by the liouville measure @xmath18 .",
    "because of the above duality , a @xmath19-involution can be defined on @xmath16 , through the action of which @xmath11 and @xmath20 are interchanged .",
    "a linear operator @xmath21 acting on @xmath22 @xmath23 and the corresponding one on @xmath24 @xmath25 through @xmath7 , have ( noether ) charges , @xmath26 conversely , when the algebra @xmath16 is given , the linear spaces @xmath27 are reproduced from it as induced representations from the trivial one on @xmath6 or on @xmath5 ( via @xmath18 ) .    according to the standard procedure",
    ", the classical dynamics on @xmath28 is described with the poisson - lie bracket on @xmath16 which is closely related with the quantization @xmath29 through @xmath30\\approx \\frak{u(}\\hslash eis(v))$ ] . here",
    "@xmath31 denotes the heisenberg - lie algebra equipped with the lie bracket coming from the evaluation map @xmath32 .",
    "then a dynamics @xmath33 on @xmath5 has a hamiltonian @xmath34 as its noether charge such that @xmath35 defined on @xmath16 by @xmath36 implements @xmath37 .",
    "similarly any symmetry of the dynamics @xmath33 constituting a finite - dimensional lie algebra @xmath38 has a noether charge in the poisson - yang algebra @xmath39 which is a generalization of heisenberg - lie algebra .",
    "in addition to the bosonic variables belonging to @xmath40 , there are fermionic ones constituting a @xmath40-module @xmath41 , which are nilpotent @xmath42 for @xmath43",
    ". then the above structure survives in an extended form with the evaluation superbracket on @xmath44 where @xmath41 and @xmath45 are @xmath46-modules graded by @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "again , @xmath49 is induced from the poisson - lie superalgebra @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and a linear operator @xmath52 is implemented by a degree @xmath3 noether charge @xmath53    this simple physical picture can be extended to a general manifold by considering the de rham complex @xmath54 on it , but not for charges .",
    "in fact , its basic algebra @xmath55 consists of differentiable functions , with their commutative pointwise product .",
    "the symmetries are given by the ( infinite - dimensional ) lie algebra @xmath56 and differentiable @xmath3-forms @xmath57 $ ] constitute the space @xmath58 of fermionic generators .",
    "it is a finitely generated projective @xmath59-module ( equivalent to a finite direct sum of @xmath59 ) , @xmath59-dual to the space @xmath60 of the differentiable @xmath3-currents .",
    "namely , a choice of an orientation @xmath61 and a differentiable oriented volume @xmath62 on the orientable double covering of our manifold with dimensionality @xmath63 determines a differentiable @xmath64-current @xmath65 dual to @xmath66 , and also differentiable ( @xmath48)-currents @xmath67 dual to @xmath58 : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the evaluation .",
    "then the space @xmath70 of differentiable ( @xmath48)-currents is identified with @xmath71 . because of @xmath72 and of @xmath73 , @xmath58 is both @xmath66-dual and @xmath74-dual to @xmath70 , respectively , by @xmath75 and by @xmath76 , while @xmath70 is a regular representation of the lie algebra @xmath77 .",
    "then we have the @xmath66-heisenberg algebra @xmath78 , with @xmath66-bilinear evaluation superbracket .",
    "it is a deformation of the poisson superalgebra @xmath79 .",
    "the latter induces the de rham complexes @xmath80 of differentiable currents and forms .    taking @xmath81",
    "as fixed and a @xmath82-form @xmath83 as variable , @xmath84 , we obtain a differentiable exterior @xmath85-current @xmath86 similarly to the above case of @xmath87 .",
    "when we choose a suitable sequence of @xmath88 of differentiable @xmath64-currents tending to a dirac measure @xmath89 at @xmath90 , @xmath91 , the limiting formula is given by @xmath92 .",
    "comparing this with @xmath93 , we can regard @xmath94 as an infinitesimal version _ _  _ _ of ( an integral over ) a cycle @xmath95 at a point @xmath90 , which generalizes a dirac measure @xmath96 to a current @xmath97 .",
    "the point - like nature of a current @xmath98 and the @xmath59-linearity of the form @xmath99 and of @xmath100 can be recovered in this form , @xmath101 for @xmath102 : @xmath103 with @xmath104 .",
    "as the symmetries @xmath105 are not @xmath59-linear but @xmath106-leibniz , they have no noether charge in @xmath107 ( poisson - yang ) . in the case of invariant de rham complex on a lie group @xmath108 with lie algebra @xmath38 ,",
    "the heisenberg algebra becomes @xmath109 and @xmath110 has a noether charge .",
    "in general , this problem will be solved by taylor superexpansions : they provide a heisenberg algebra @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is associated with a lie - algebraic cochain complex @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) ( see definition 3 in sect.2 ) augmented by @xmath115 : @xmath116 with degree shift by @xmath48 , and @xmath117 .",
    "@xmath112 provides a regular representation of @xmath118 .",
    "then a symmetry given by a lie algebra @xmath119 will have a noether charge in @xmath120 .",
    "in the general setting with the implementer @xmath34 of a derivation @xmath121 generating a dynamics , an ordinary symmetry is described by an element @xmath122 whose charge @xmath123 ( of degree @xmath64 ) satisfies @xmath124=0 $ ] .",
    "a supersymmetry is given by an operator of degree @xmath3 acting on @xmath125 or @xmath126 defined by @xmath127 and @xmath128 ( see sect.2 ) whose charge @xmath129 ( of degree @xmath3 ) also satisfies @xmath130=0 $ ] . these ( super)symmetries form a canonical lie superalgebra , either with @xmath131 ( or @xmath4)-grading or @xmath132-grading .",
    "one of our main objective here is to examine the possibility of passing from @xmath133-grading to @xmath131 ( or @xmath4)-grading , by asking when ( super)symmetries can be realized by nilpotent charges of degree @xmath3 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : the essence of algebraic formulation of homotopy is explained in sect.2 , which is extended in sect.3 to the equivariant situation involving a principal bundle .",
    "then , the mutual relation between de rham complexes and homotopy is explained in sect.4 by using the taylor superexpansions , a graded extension of taylor expansions . in sect.5 ,",
    "the relation between the complexes for the total space and for the base space of the bundle is clarified .",
    "the method of algebraic homotopy is generalized in sect.6 to the non 1-connected cases . by using the developed techniques , the obstruction to transform @xmath2-grading to @xmath134 ( or @xmath4)-grading caused by the presence of torsion",
    "is shown to be eliminated by a homotopy covering .",
    "to facilitate the unified treatment of chain and cochain complexes , we note the following simple observation : a chain complex @xmath135 over a ground ring @xmath136 , @xmath137 consisting of graded @xmath136-modules @xmath138 with @xmath136-linear boundaries @xmath139 @xmath140 ( of degree @xmath48 and satisfying @xmath141 ) can be viewed as a _ cochain _ complex @xmath142 of _ negatively graded _ @xmath136-modules , simply by a renaming @xmath143 to reverse the sign of degrees which makes @xmath144 @xmath145 to be coboundaries of degree @xmath3 : @xmath146 in spite of its degree @xmath47 , we keep the name _ boundary _ for @xmath147 @xmath148 , because it appears only in _ negatively graded _ complexes without any confusions .",
    "dual to this is a _ positively graded _",
    "cochain complex , @xmath149 , defined by @xmath150 with @xmath136-linear coboundaries @xmath151 of degree @xmath3 : @xmath152 to formulate the duality between @xmath153 and @xmath126 in a consistent and convenient way , this simple trick plays a crucial role , by which both @xmath125 and @xmath126 can be treated as cochain complexes on the same ground . without this",
    "it is difficult , for instance , to construct a ( universal poisson ) cochain complex @xmath154 for cochain maps @xmath155 between cochains @xmath156 . here",
    "the tensor product @xmath154 of two cochain complexes is a cochain complex equipped with the coboundary @xmath157 and the total @xmath131-grading defined by @xmath158 .",
    "a cochain map @xmath159 of degree @xmath160 is defined by a family @xmath161 of @xmath136-linear maps @xmath162 satisfying the condition @xmath163\\equiv \\partial ^{\\prime } \\circ \\phi -(-)^{k}\\phi \\circ \\partial = 0 ,   \\label{der}\\ ] ] where @xmath129 denotes a universal charge for coboundary . by definition , the element @xmath164 in @xmath165 corresponding to @xmath159",
    "has non - vanishing components only at degree @xmath166 in @xmath167 .",
    "when @xmath159 has an algebraic implementer @xmath168 ( noether charge ) in @xmath169 , the condition ( [ der ] ) on @xmath159 amounts to @xmath170 . actually , the map @xmath171 sending @xmath172 to @xmath173 is a @xmath64-degree cochain map .",
    "the above equation @xmath174 can be interpreted as the invariance of the charge @xmath175 : when @xmath159 describes an ordinary infinitesimal symmetry ( of degree 0 ) @xmath176 on a self dual cochain , the condition @xmath170 is seen to be equivalent to each of @xmath177=0 $ ] and @xmath178=0 $ ] and hence , to @xmath179=0 $ ] where @xmath180 .    to emphasize the importance of integer grading ( in contrast to @xmath2-grading ) we mention the following examples of chain complexes :    \\1 ) the chain complex @xmath181 of a category @xmath182 , based in each degree @xmath183 on the sequences of @xmath160 arrows @xmath184 , with @xmath185 expressing the composition of morphisms , and @xmath186 their associativity .",
    "the @xmath187 lead to an intermediate topological space @xmath188 , the so - called classifying one .",
    "\\2 ) the infinitesimal version of the above ( with half open arrows ) is expressed by de rham differentiable currents .",
    "\\3 ) the corresponding equivariant cases are expressed by the cartan - de rham currents @xmath189 , where @xmath190 is the regular representation space of a lie algebra @xmath38 with degree -1 assigned .",
    "this corresponds to the equivalence between representation space @xmath5 of @xmath191 and lie structure on @xmath192 with @xmath64 bracket on @xmath5 .",
    "there are two different boundaries @xmath193 extending the bracket @xmath194:\\frak{g}_{-1}\\wedge \\frak{g}_{-1}\\rightarrow \\frak{g}_{-1}$ ] , one as derivation for the algebra structure and the other as derivation for the coalgebra structure .",
    "we proceed now to introduce in a new way the notion of algebraic homotopy based upon the general notion of freeness in the categorical formulation .",
    "we recall that , for a given functor @xmath195 from a category @xmath182 to another one @xmath196 , an object @xmath197 in @xmath182 is called @xmath198-_free _ if one can find an object @xmath199 in @xmath200 and a natural isomorphim @xmath201 such an @xmath199 is called a _ basis _ for @xmath197 , and each morphism in @xmath182 [ called `` @xmath182-map '' hereafter for short ] from @xmath197 corresponds exactly to a @xmath202-map from the basis @xmath203 . in standard situations where @xmath182 consists in monoidal objects in a category",
    "@xmath204 underlying @xmath196 , any object @xmath199 serves as basis for a free object @xmath197 constructed formally . in such cases",
    ", we have a functor @xmath205 called a ( left ) adjoint to @xmath206 , @xmath207 creating a free object @xmath208 in @xmath182 from each basis @xmath203 in @xmath202 and a natural isomorphism @xmath209 then , the canonical maps , @xmath210 ( called unit and counit , respectively ) , generate resolutions such that @xmath211 .",
    "so any object @xmath212 has a free presentation @xmath213 @xmath214 with an equivalence relation @xmath215 ( which is , in an abelian category , nothing but the equivalence w.r.t .",
    "@xmath216 ) .",
    "dually , the adjunction defines co - free objects @xmath217 .",
    "adjunction of a category @xmath182 with a point category , consisting of one object with its identity , plays an important role . a corresponding free ( resp .",
    ", cofree ) object is initial ( resp . ,",
    "final ) in @xmath182 .",
    "the arrows linking them to other objects correspond bijectively to these objects . in a simplex category ,",
    "all objects are initial ( resp . , final ) .",
    "groups give examples of such a simplex category , with elements of the group as objects , and arrows @xmath218 .",
    "also hilbert spaces give such example , with objects the lines generated by unit vectors @xmath197 and morphism @xmath219 the orthogonal projection : @xmath220 . by adding the @xmath64 object , partial isometries provide adjoint functors .",
    "the existence of an adjoint functor ( @xmath221 in the above ) to a given one ( @xmath222 in the above ) is the most general form of uniform continuity ( also of inversion of @xmath206 ) , since it necessarily commutes with ( category ) limits .",
    "this is one of the main key in analysis , where it comes not only as integration by parts , but also in spectral theory : it converts the monoid @xmath223 into a @xmath196-function space on the spectrum @xmath199 .",
    "after these generalities worth mentioning , let us examine the case of the forgetting functor @xmath224 @xmath225 from the category @xmath226of cochain complexes @xmath126 ( as above ) to the category @xmath227 of negatively graded modules : the functor @xmath228 simply forgets boundary operators absent in @xmath225 , or equivalently sets them equal to @xmath229 . to attain a unified treatment of the notion of _ contractibility _ for complexes with various kinds of algebraic structures , we need the following    * definition 1 * : a cochain complex @xmath126 ( as above ) is _ contractible _ if and only if it is @xmath225-free or -cofree .",
    "we denote such by @xmath230 : @xmath231 .    the term _ contractible _ is slightly ambiguous because in the usual chain theory it means homotopic to @xmath64 ( cofree ) , while in the space theory it means homotopic to a point ( free and cofree ) , and in the algebraic cochain theory it means homotopic to scalar ( free ) . but these various meanings can be treated in quite a coherent manner as free or cofree object .    before explaining our use of the definition , let us mention useful intermediate cases , like being @xmath232-free in @xmath225 , or forgetting @xmath233 beyond some fixed degree .",
    "the former case associates to each subchain complex @xmath234 a semi - direct decomposition @xmath235 , which is actually isomorphic to a direct one if one factor is @xmath236 ( whose proof is easy ) .",
    "the second case describes acylicity above the chosen degree .",
    "* definition 2 * : two cochain complexes @xmath237 are homotopy equivalent if and only if @xmath238 .    to make more explicit the meaning of this notion , and to see its implication at the chain map level , recall the mapping cylinder @xmath239 of a cochain map @xmath240 of degree @xmath64 .",
    "this chain construction mimics the graph of a map , as embedding into a simplex with vertices in either domain or range , and arrows @xmath241 : @xmath242 the subcomplexes , @xmath243 and @xmath244 , in @xmath239 have their quotients @xmath245 and @xmath246 , respectively : @xmath247    @xmath248    * lemma * : the forgetting functor @xmath249 has a left adjoint functor @xmath250 and a right adjoint functor @xmath251 .",
    "proof : from any given complex @xmath252 of negatively graded modules ( i.e. , @xmath253 for @xmath254 ) , we can construct a cochain complex @xmath255 belonging to @xmath256 by defining @xmath257 together with the boundaries @xmath258 } { \\longrightarrow } m_{-k}\\oplus m_{-k+1}=\\phi ^{l}(m_{-})_{-k+1}$ ] , which terminates with @xmath259 ( not with @xmath260 ! ) at degree @xmath64 . by chasing the commutativity in the diagram ( starting from @xmath261 ) : @xmath262 } } { \\rightarrow } & m_{-k}\\oplus m_{-k+1 } & \\rightarrow \\\\",

    "the cochain @xmath255 is related to the preceeding cone on a cochain by means of the shift functor in @xmath225 : @xmath267 : with the @xmath64 coboundary on @xmath268 , @xmath269 . for the right adjoint , just define @xmath270 . * remark * : taking @xmath271 with@xmath272 and @xmath273 in the above , we see that the counit @xmath274 is given by the projection cochain map @xmath275 . as for the unit @xmath276 ,",
    "it is the cochain inclusion @xmath277 .",
    "the importance of the shift functor @xmath278 is well known in topology to express the topological suspension operator as a quotient of the cylinder @xmath279 $ ] with each basis collapsed into one point ( or , both together with one edge @xmath280 $ ] into the same point ) .",
    "the suspension can also be an open cone , when the half open interval is used instead .",
    "however , its crucial role here will be to express the regular representation of a ( lie ) algebra .",
    "it appears as the second component in the above @xmath281 . to stress the shift from a @xmath64-dimensional object to a @xmath3-dimensional arrow we shall also use the famous bar notation @xmath282 for @xmath283 and @xmath284 for the image category of strictly negatively graded modules",
    "let @xmath285 be the canonical extension of @xmath286 .",
    "then the relation @xmath287 extends to @xmath288 .",

    "now we can see that @xmath303 : the projection @xmath304 has a cochain section by using the freeness of @xmath305 and the module map @xmath306 .",
    "moreover @xmath159 factors canonically through @xmath307 , the last map being a homotopy equivalence as defined before . combined with the other inclusion @xmath308 , it generates homotopy of maps : two cochain maps @xmath309 are homotopic iff they factor through the two canonical inclusions @xmath310 by some chain map @xmath311 .",
    "then it has been shown @xcite that the homotopy equivalence of cochain complexes as defined previously is equivalent to the existence of a pair of opposite chain maps , with both compositions being homotopy equivalent to the identity .    from the above existence of free and cofree objects",
    ", we see that homotopy is a selfdual relation .",
    "then it applies both to negatively graded cochains @xmath312 and to their positively graded dual @xmath125 .",
    "for instance , @xmath313 becomes free , while @xmath314 becomes cofree .",
    "both type of cochains come together in duality ( see sect.4 ) .",

    "the latter hodge duality @xmath322 equips @xmath323 and @xmath324 with both boundary and coboundary @xmath325 .",
    "so they become mixed cochain complexes .",
    "the invariance of the hamiltonian @xmath326 by @xmath327 implies @xmath328 = laplacian .    in the present work",
    ", however , we shall use a taylor superexpansion of a de rham complex ( see sect.4 ) .",
    "contrary to the case of de rham complex , it is of infinite degree but degreewise finite dimensional .",

    "proof : this is due to the following series of adjunctions : @xmath712    since adjoint functors carry a free object to a free one , we also have    * corollary 6 * : both functors @xmath713 and @xmath714 respect @xmath182-cones with @xmath182 being @xmath715 or @xmath716 .",

    "proof : the adjunction @xmath228 of both categories @xmath356 and @xmath719 with @xmath357 seen in sect.2 provides @xmath357-free objects , which are respected by the adjunction @xmath720 .",

    "finally , a chain map inducing a homology isomorphism is a @xmath357-homotopy equivalence , because its cone chain is acyclic , hence @xmath726 @xcite .    now",
    "the lie superalgebra of homology @xmath727 is related to that of homotopy @xmath728 by the hurewicz map @xmath729 , which is just the analytic continuation of the constant function @xmath3 along a map @xmath730 .",
