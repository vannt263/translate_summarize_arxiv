    "the ionization energies and electron affinities of these materials are such that the effective potential - energy profiles for electrons and holes along the direction of growth take the forms of periodic arrays of quantum wells .",
    "the barriers between the wells are thin enough so that their otherwise isolated single - particle levels become resonantly coupled by quantum tunneling .",
    "such coupling mixes these levels , giving rise to so - called energy mini - bands , in an analogous fashion to the appearance of energy bands in a crystal . in this sense",
    ", a superlattice behaves as an artificial crystal with a much larger period ( of the order of @xmath4 nm ) than any real crystal , and , consequently , with a much smaller ( mini-)brillouin zone in reciprocal space .",
    "the mini - bandwidths and , consequently , the carrier mini - effective masses are determined by the thickness of the barriers , whereas the mini - bandgaps are determined by the depths and widths of the wells .",
    "therefore , the mini - band structure of a superlattice can be engineered by controlling these parameters @xcite .",
    "+ crystalline heterostructures such as this can be manufactured from inorganic @xcite and organic @xcite materials , employing sophisticated , and costly , epitaxial crystal - growth methods , like molecular - beam epitaxy and chemical or physical vapor deposition techniques @xcite .",

    "+ this report deals with a different kind of superlattice , which is constituted by a quasi - linear @xmath0-conjugated alternating block copolymer @xcite .",
    "now , the effective potential - energy profiles for carriers assume the forms of periodic arrays of tunnel - coupled quantum dots .",
    "( to conform to the current usage in the semiconductor literature , it is more appropriate to employ the term ` quantum dot ' than ` quantum well ' in this case , since in the former the carriers are confined in the three directions , whereas in the latter they are confined in one direction only . )",
    "hence , this organic heterostructure can be considered as a molecular onedimensional analog of the aforementioned solid - state layered superlattice .",
    "+ molecular organic heterostructures such as this present the following advantages over their solid - state counterparts : first , in principle , it is possible to construct a virtually unlimited variety of them , due , in turn , to the virtually unlimited number of monomers available , whereas the number of parent crystalline materials available is limited @xcite .",
    "second , the `` interface '' between two blocks is a chemical carbon - carbon bond , in contrast to the interface between two crystalline layers where it is required that the materials exhibit similar lattice constants @xcite , which notably limits the variety of heterostructures that can be obtained .",

    "this strategy is complementary to the one presented in the previous contribution to this issue @xcite , where the blocks are so short that the copolymer does not behave like a superlattice but instead like a new polymer , whose bandgap and effective masses can be controlled by the mole fractions of the parent monomers .",

    "in particular , firstly the parent polymers will be characterized by means of quantum - chemical electronic structure and bandstructure methods .",
    "secondly , once the block copolymers are designed and assembled , their mini - bandstructures will be determined employing an envelope crystalline - orbital approximation @xcite , which is conceptually more attractive and computationally more economical for this task than any of the conventional atomistic quantum - chemical methods employed thus far for copolymers @xcite .",
    "this method is a straightforward adaptation for molecules of the envelope - function , or effective - mass , approximation widely employed in solid - state physics @xcite .",
    "the design strategy consists of the following steps : ( 1 ) choice of a pair @xmath5-@xmath6 of parent polymers with an appropriate alignment of their valence - band tops , or highest unoccupied crystal orbitals ( hoco s ) , and conduction - band bottoms , or lowest unoccupied crystal orbitals ( luco s ) .",
