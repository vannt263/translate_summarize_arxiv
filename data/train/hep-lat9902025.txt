    "little is known experimentally of the properties of the @xmath11 spectrum of states , apart from the detection of the pseudoscalar @xmath0 , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) state by the cdf collaboration @xcite . at",
    "the very least these states provide an excellent `` blind '' test for some of the techniques used in measuring non - perturbative properties such as the mass spectrum and decay widths .",
    "the study of non - degenerate heavy quarks provides us with a unique probe of qcd .",
    "the weak decays of @xmath11 states provide a plethora of new methods for calculating the less well determined ckm matrix elements , in particular its semi - leptonic decay mode @xmath13 will provide an accurate measurement of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of states with the ground state mass subtracted , when calculated via potential models @xcite , for example , is in broad agreement with quenched lattice qcd @xcite . despite concerns that potential models would have large relativistic corrections ( as a simple centre - of - mass argument implies @xmath15 for the charm quark is approximately 0.5 ) it appears that it is still a reasonable method for calculating the spectrum .",
    "nonetheless , a non - perturbative measurement of the spectrum is important and is being actively pursued .",
    "the potential model approach unfortunately does not provide , _ a priori _ , a method for determining the ground state mass and hence a number of different phenomenological methods have to be used .",
    "lattice qcd , on the other hand , can provide an _ ab initio _",
    "method for determining its mass .",
    "the use of a non - relativistic hamiltonian to describe the behaviour of a bottom quark in quenched lattice qcd @xcite has been employed very effectively for the spin - independent sector of the @xmath16 spectrum @xcite .",
    "for relatively coarse lattice spacings , this technique is also applicable for @xmath17 states and indeed two calculations @xcite of the @xmath1 spectrum and @xmath18 using non - relativistic @xmath19 and @xmath20 quarks have been carried out .",
    "however , as the @xmath17 spectrum is not reproduced very accurately using this approach @xcite there remains some question as to its accuracy for the @xmath1 sector .",
    "another approach which will work for lattice spacings where @xmath21 is to use a discretised relativistic lagrangian , which , for the lattice spacing used in this letter , reproduces the charmonium spectrum reasonably well @xcite .",
    "here we take the approach of combining these separate methods for treating the @xmath19 and @xmath20 quarks .",
    "in essence this involves computing green s functions from a discretised nrqcd hamiltonian ( nrgf ) with propagators calculated using a improved discretised qcd lagrangian devised originally by sheikholeslami and wohlert @xcite ( swp ) from the same set of quenched ( zero flavour ) qcd gauge configurations and then combining them into two point functions .",
    "the damped exponential behaviour of this correlation function will provide information about the mass of the states we are interested in .",
    "the rest of this letter is organised as follows : in the following section we describe a method for computing @xmath18 directly from zero momentum correlation functions , and demonstrate why this has the smallest systematic error ; after this the computational details of the calculation are outlined , explaining briefly the details of nrqcd hamiltonian used for the bottom quark and the lagrangian used for the charm quark ; we then present the numerical results and in the conclusions we compare the results with other calculations of @xmath18 .",
    "for large euclidean times , the two point function of a meson operator constructed from either nrgf s or swp s will take the following form    @xmath22    where the integral sign can also indicate a sum over discrete lattice points .",
    "( we have also discarded the possible effect of the finite size of the lattice in the time direction for relativistic correlation functions . ) as demonstrated in @xcite and @xcite the variable @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 is the lattice spacing ) , also referred to as `` the pole mass '' , has quite different interpretations depending on whether the operator @xmath25 is constructed from nrgf s or swp s .",
    "the former is the binding energy of the state with the heavy quark mass subtracted ; the latter satisfies the relationship @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the mass of the state , @xmath28 are the systematic errors from the finite lattice spacing and volume and @xmath29 is a lattice artefact due to the breaking of lorentz invariance on the lattice this parameter vanishes for @xmath30 and grows to be a large correction as @xmath31 approaches 1 and beyond . nonetheless , the difference of the pole masses , for either nrgf s or swp s will reproduce the physical mass difference ( assuming other discretisation effects are under control ) .",
    "since this process of changing the zero of the quark mass is additive , one therefore expects @xmath32 where the rhs is the physical mass difference and @xmath33 is computed using correlation functions with the composition used in this letter . as one can easily construct a @xmath34 along the same lines one can also state that @xmath35 it is therefore possible derive an expression for @xmath36 simply from the pole masses without resorting to using other possible mass definitions .",
    "the mass of the @xmath4 has yet to be determined , and has to be estimated from the @xmath37 and a potential model calculation of the hyperfine splitting .",
    "a larger error is that resulting from the quenched approximation .",
    "a first estimate of the effect of quenching is from the variation of the effective lattice spacing between observables having different `` typical '' momentum scales . in this light",
    "we estimate this from the difference between the masses determined from equations [ mass - diff - eqn ] and [ mass - diff - eqn - other ] . a more traditional approach to calculate the mass of the @xmath2 is to determine the `` kinetic '' mass , ( often labelled @xmath38 ) which is derived from the dispersion relationship of pole masses at different finite momenta .",
    "this however has the drawback that it has a much larger statistical error than the pole mass .",
    "in particular , while the kinetic mass is proportional to the inverse of a difference ( i.e. the zero and smallest non - zero momentum pole masses ) , the mass derived from equations ( [ mass - diff - eqn ] ) and ( [ mass - diff - eqn - other ] ) are directly proportional to it .",
    "the calculation was carried out in quenched lattice qcd using the wilson gluon action at @xmath39 on a @xmath40 lattice .",
    "technical details on how these configurations were calculated and the exact form of the gauge action can be found in @xcite . in terms of the string tension resulting from the static quark potential , the lattice spacing is approximately 0.07 fm , resulting in a spatial side length of 1.68 fm .    the non - relativistic hamiltonian used was corrected to @xmath41 .",
    "the coefficients in the hamiltonian were tree - level mean - field estimates .",
    "the mean field improvement coefficient is calculated from the plaquette .",
    "further details on the hamiltonian used are described in @xcite .",
    "the bare mass parameter @xmath42 for the @xmath11 states was chosen to be @xmath43 . from @xcite",
    "this choice of the bare quark mass parameter is consistent , within quenching errors , with the b - quark mass when defined by the kinetic mass of the @xmath37 , and the scale determined from the @xmath44 splitting . as the splitting of equation ( [ mass - diff - eqn ] ) should be most sensitive to a variation in the @xmath19-quark mass , we use this scale to also fix the charm quark mass . in the case of the @xmath34-like states we chose a range of values for @xmath42 from 1.1 to 1.3 .",
    "a linear interpolation is carried out to determine the pole mass for the above bare parameter .",
    "the relativistic lagrangian used was the sheikholeslami - wohlert action @xcite . for the @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath11 states ,",
    "the value of the improvement coefficient , @xmath47 , in this action was determined by the tadpole improvement procedure @xcite . for the @xmath34 states ,",
    "a slightly different choice of @xmath47 was used , determined by imposing pcac for light quark masses @xcite . for this very fine lattice spacing ,",
    "the masses derived from these different prescriptions for @xmath47 are indistinguishable @xcite . for the @xmath34 and @xmath45 ,",
    "a range of light quark masses were used , and then extrapolated to the chiral limit .    in order to determine the charm quark mass we use the kinetic mass of the @xmath48 @xcite ( requoted in table [ kin - mass ] for clarity ) .",
    "this is obtained from correlation functions with one swp with either @xmath49 or @xmath50 and one swp with a @xmath51 corresponding to the strange quark mass .",
    "it can be demonstrated that the kinetic masses of these correlation functions differ from the pole masses by only a few percent , so ambiguities in the definition of the charm quark mass are minimised .",
    "in particular we find that the charm quark mass is close to a bare quark mass equivalent to @xmath52 , so the interpolation is relatively mild .    in the case of the @xmath11-like states ,",
    "coulomb gauge fixed correlation functions were computed using sources optimised to select the ground @xmath0 state and its first radial excitation .",
    "the typical radius for these functions lay in the range of 3 to 5 . for @xmath52",
    "the correlation functions were computed with 201 configurations and for @xmath53 140 configurations were used . as a green s function calculated using the nrqcd hamiltonian only contains upper spin components , at @xmath52 the gauge field was also time reversed so as to obtain correlation functions using the lower spin components of the relativistic propagator and improve the statistics .",
    "correlation functions for other states in the spectrum , that is the @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 were also calculated .",
    "the absolute binding energies of the @xmath55 and @xmath57 were calculated while the @xmath54 and @xmath58 energies were determined from single exponential ratio fits relative to the @xmath0 and @xmath59 respectively .    for the @xmath34-like states ,",
    "gauge invariant correlation functions were computed with 68 configurations .",
    "smeared sources were computed using jacobi smearing @xcite .",
    "the fit criteria for obtaining the pole masses of @xmath11 states were the same as those as used in @xcite , using multi - exponential fits .",
    "the @xmath34-like states were fitted to a single exponential .",
    "the gauge configurations and swp s were calculated on a cray t3d at the edinburgh parallel computing centre ( epcc ) while the coulomb gauge fixing , nrgf s and correlation functions were computed on a cray j90 at the same site .",
    "the pole masses calculated for the various heavy - heavy states are listed in in table [ pole - mass-1 ] , as well the pole masses for charmonia listed in @xcite .",
    "the `` pole mass '' for the @xmath37 obtained from degenerate nrgf s is listed in table [ pole - mass-1 ] @xcite .",
    "the chirally extrapolated results for @xmath45 and @xmath34 are quoted in tables [ pole - mass-2 ] and [ pole - mass-3 ] .    from @xcite",
    "the choice of the bare quark mass parameter of 1.22 is consistent , within quenching errors , with the b - quark mass . on the other hand ,",
    "the choice of @xmath52 for the relativistic quark is not quite consistent with the charm quark mass . by performing a slight linear extrapolation on the mass difference defined in ( [ mass - diff - eqn ] ) using the kinetic mass , we find @xmath60 and @xmath61    as we can see , these two differences vary by a large degree , having a different sign from each other .",
    "when converted into a dimensionful scale , they vary by approximately @xmath62 . in the case of equation ( [ mass - diff - eqn ] )",
    ", the choice of scale is reasonably clear ; in order to be consistent in the determination of the quark masses , one should employ the scale defined via the @xmath63 splitting , which for this choice of action and parameters is @xmath64 @xcite . in the case of equation ( [ mass - diff - eqn - other ] ) , the choice is less clear . for the heavy - light masses one would normally use a different definition of the lattice spacing , for example that defined from the string tension (",
    "ideally one would use the @xmath65 or @xmath66 split for the appropriate heavy - light combination , but the statistical error is too large in this case ) .",
    "nonetheless the above argument for the heavy - heavy difference indicates that the lattice spacing from the @xmath63 splitting should be used here as well .",
    "the resulting estimate for @xmath67 from equation ( [ mass - diff - hl - result ] ) varies by approximately @xmath68 solely by the choice of this ambiguity in the lattice spacing .",
    "the result for the mass from equation ( [ mass - diff - hh - result ] ) lies at the centre of this interval .",
    "we therefore take the mass determined from equation ( [ mass - diff - hh - result ] ) as our best estimate of the central value and take the variation with respect to the scale for equation ( [ mass - diff - hl - result ] ) as a conservative estimate of the systematic error due to quenching and quark mass ambiguities .",
    "we also require an estimate for the hyperfine splitting for @xmath69 as experimental data for @xmath70 is not yet available . quenched lattice studies of the charmonium spectrum",
    "have always underestimated the hyperfine splitting ( as the central charge from the coulombic term is smaller than usual for qcd where @xmath71 ) . in order to estimate the size of this splitting we use the value of the hyperfine splitting determined in @xcite in conjunction with the the potential model results quoted in @xcite . from this",
    "we estimate the @xmath69 splitting to be @xmath72 .",
    "hence we take @xmath73 . using these parameters ,",
    "one finds :    @xmath74    where the first error is statistical , the second is the systematic error due to quenching and the third is the systematic error in the estimation of @xmath75      the absolute or relative binding energies for the higher states of the spectrum are listed in table [ spectrum - table ] . in figure",
    "[ spectrum - plot ] we plot these results along with the final lattice results at @xmath76 quoted in @xcite and the potential model predictions in @xcite , with the scale determined from the spin averaged @xmath66 splitting , which has the smallest statistical errors . in general",
    "these results are in broad agreement with each other , although there does appear to be a significant difference in the hyperfine splitting between the lattice results and the potential model calculation .",
    "in this letter we have presented a calculation of the ground state mass of the @xmath2 and the immediate spectrum of states .",
    "although the calculation has been carried in the quenched approximation , by using two different possible derivations of the ground state mass which use a wide range of different possible quark masses , we believe we have conservatively estimated its effect",
    ". the results for the spectrum are , for the most part , in broad agreement with the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the ground state mass quoted here is consistent with previous lattice calculations @xcite in the quenched approximation calculated using the kinetic mass definition , using nrgf s for both the charm and bottom quarks on coarser lattices .",
    "qcd sum rule calculations which are listed in @xcite predict that @xmath67 lies in the interval of 6.3 - 6.5 @xmath77 .",
    "kwong and rosner @xcite surveyed the phenomenological techniques used in determining @xmath67 and estimated it to lie in the range of 6.194 @xmath77 to 6.292 @xmath77 .",
    "most phenomenological estimates for the mass have been taken to lie in the centre of this interval @xcite although more recently other work by fulcher @xcite has suggested it to be slightly larger at @xmath78 .",
    "nonetheless , the mass we have determined is certainly consistent with the present estimate of the mass from the cdf collaboration @xcite of @xmath79 .    despite the systematic error due to the hyperfine splitting in @xmath80 sector ,",
    "the largest error is the effect of quenching and quark mass ambiguities .",
    "eliminating this approximation by the use of _ dynamical _ configurations , where sea quark effects are included appears to be the most important step in reducing the error on this mass .",
    "likewise , a more complete understanding of how the differences of equations ( [ mass - diff - eqn ] ) and ( [ mass - diff - eqn - other ] ) behave as a function of the heavy quark masses also needs to be carried out . such configurations ( albeit on coarser lattices than used here ) are now available and a measurement of the spin - averaged @xmath2 would be the next course of action . * acknowledgements *    this work was supported by pparc and the jsps research for the future programme .",
    "hps would also like to thank the university of tsukuba for their hospitality while this letter was being written .",
    "the authors are grateful to the staff at the epcc for their technical support and sara collins , arifa ali khan and other members of the ukqcd collaboration for useful discussions .",
    "the authors would also like to thank shoji hashimoto and ruedi burkhalter for helpful comments and andreas kronfeld for pointing out ( twice ) equation ( [ mass - diff - eqn ] ) .",
