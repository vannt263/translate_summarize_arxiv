    "in conclusion we have discussed a band structure based procedure which can be successfully used to describe the electronic structure of disordered alloys and randomly substituted systems .",
    "we have used a simple tight binding based model to describe the physics of the differences between minimum size super cell calculations and large super cells with random distributions of impurity atoms in the cell . in order to visualize the changes we present a simple unfolding procedure which is demonstrated to work very well indeed .",
    "we have shown that with small impurity potentials the band structure is qualitatively described by a rigid shift as in a virtual crystal approximation .",
    "however even here the bands become broadened in both energy and momentum space .",
    "this broadening becomes very large for larger impurity potentials .",
    "we also show that the fermi surfaces are strongly smeared out for medium size impurity potentials and that the peak position of the broadened structure as a function of momentum would yield a fermi surface determined by the crossing at an energy corresponding to the electron count i.e. the `` fermi energy '' which does not agree with the luttenger theorem size of the fermi surface .    in order to quantify the effects of the impurity scattering effects we present the real and imaginary parts of the self energy which clearly demonstrates the various effects impurity scattering and randomness has on the electronic structure .",
    "the smearing effects at the fermi energy can cause a semiconducting density of states in the ordered case turn into a metallic density of states .",
    "this effect is quite spectacular in the comparison of a density functional based _ ab initio _ calculation of the electronic structure of ordered and disordered lih .",
    "the results we show for mg li and li h alloys using density functional methods demonstrate that _ ab initio _ methods can be used which opens the door to the study of a large number of real material systems .",

    "<S> although in some cases such as the extreme dilute limit where the impurity impurity interference effects can be neglected this may be a reasonable approximation to the real problem it is important to develop theoretical methods based on the same approaches and approximations used for pure systems to check for the importance of randomness . for a detailed discussion of development in _ ab - initio _ </S>",
    "<S> theory of alloys we refer to a recent review paper by ruban and abrikosov.@xcite we too use the super cell approximation but allow for randomness in the impurity distribution across the super cell . </S>",
    "<S> we then propose a simple procedure to present the unfolded calculated band structures in a way as seen by angle resolved photo emission spectroscopy ( arpes ) and demonstrate the effect of impurity scattering on the band structure and the self energy .    </S>",
    "<S> we first present the method used to unfold the band - structure in the first brillouin zone of the super cell to the first brillouin zone of the original cell . which is basically based on bloch s theorem and symmetrization of the wave - functions . </S>",
    "<S> the method can be readily applied to all first - principle codes able to calculate partial densities of states and local symmetry or orbital projected band structures . </S>",
    "<S> we then demonstrate the basic concepts of the random impurity calculations using a simple tight binding like model and on site impurity potentials . </S>",
    "<S> in the last section before the conclusion we describe the use of these concepts in the dft calculation of a real alloy system composed of li substituted with either h or mg . </S>"
