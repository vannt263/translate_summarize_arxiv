    "investigations of traffic flows on substrates of various topologies and discussions of their efficiency have been a topic of recent research interest @xcite .",
    "the optimization of network structure and traffic protocols to achieve maximum efficiency is also a problem of practical importance .",
    "congestion effects can occur in real networks like telephone networks , computer networks and the internet .",
    "congestion / decongestion transitions are seen in these systems .",
    "recent studies on the ` ping'-experiment shows @xmath1 fluctuation at the critical point @xcite .    message transport on different network geometries has been studied earlier on a linear chain @xcite , on two - dimensional lattices @xcite and on cayley trees @xcite where messages are routed through shortest paths . here",
    ", we consider a @xmath0 ring lattice of ordinary nodes and hubs similar to that considered in @xcite .",
    "networks based on ring geometries have been studied in the context of atm networks and local area networks ( lan ) .",
    "a realistic ring topology such as fiber distributed data interface ( fddi ) sends messages clockwise or counter - clockwise through the shared link .",
    "similarly , messages are deposited on our model @xmath0 ring lattice at regular intervals .",
    "we show that the network reproduces the experimental findings of the internet traffic flow .",
    "here we discuss an one dimensional version of the communication network of nodes and hubs . the base network is a ring lattice of size @xmath2 with nearest neighbor connections .",
    "hubs are distributed randomly in the lattice where each hub has @xmath3 nearest neighbors .",
    "no two hubs are separated by a less than a minimum distance , @xmath4 . in our simulation",
    "we have taken @xmath5=4 and @xmath4=1 , although fig.[fig_sim1](a ) illustrates only @xmath5=2 connections .",
    "the distance between a source and target is defined by the manhattan distance @xmath6 .",
    "messages are routed along the shortest path between a source @xmath7 and a target @xmath8 in the clockwise direction taking advantage of all links in the direction of the target .",
    "thus , if a message is routed from a source @xmath7 to a target @xmath8 on this lattice through the baseline mechanism , it takes the path @xmath7 - 1 - 2-y-3 - 4 - 5-@xmath8 as in fig.[fig_sim1](a ) .",
    "in our simulation , a given number @xmath9 of source and target pairs start sending @xmath9 messages at every @xmath10 time step for a total run time of @xmath11 for a lattice size @xmath12 , and @xmath13 . the average load per node is given as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the total number of messages flowing on the lattice .",
    "for smaller values of the posting rate , the value of @xmath16 is very small and the system is in the decongested phase . as the posting rate of messages",
    "is increased , the system attains the congested regime .",
    "the autocorrelation function of the average load per node ( @xmath16 ) is defined as @xcite :    @xmath17    the fourier transform of the autocorrelation function @xmath18 is known as the spectral density or power spectrum @xmath19 , and is defined as @xmath20    we plot @xmath19 against @xmath21 for posting rates of @xmath22 .",
    "the plot of @xmath19 against @xmath21 shows a power law : @xmath23 . in this case the spectral exponent @xmath24 thus indicating @xmath1 scaling irrespective of the posting rate ( fig.[fig_sim1](b ) ) .",
    "we also study the inter - arrival time of messages for the most congested hub .",
    "the most congested hub is identified by calculating the coefficient of betweenness centrality ( cbc ) , which is defined as the ratio of the number of messages @xmath25 which pass through a given hub @xmath5 to the total number of messages which run simultaneously i.e. @xmath26 .",
    "hubs with higher cbc value are more prone to congestion .",
    "we calculate the inter arrival time of messages for the hub with highest cbc .",
    "inter - arrival times were studied earlier in the context of dynamics of information access on the web @xcite and also for human dynamics @xcite . for the baseline mechanism ,",
    "the distribution of inter - arrival times is of the stretched exponential form , given by    @xmath27    where @xmath28 for @xmath29 ( fig.[fig_sim3](b ) ) . if the hubs in the lattice are connected by random assortative connections with two connections per hubs as shown in fig.[fig_sim3](a ) , the inter arrival time of messages show power law behavior of the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 for @xmath29 ( fig.[fig_sim3](b ) ) . in the next section , we will discuss a double ring variation of the @xmath0 network , and discuss another statistical characteriser , the travel time distribution .",
    "the @xmath0 ring lattice can be easily modified to the @xmath0 double - ring lattice as shown in fig.[fig_sim2](a ) .",
    "double - ring network topologies have been used earlier to model the head - direction system in animals @xcite as well as for local area networks ( lan ) .",
    "our double - ring lattice consists of two concentric ring lattices ( fig.[fig_sim2](a ) ) of size @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively , where @xmath32 is the size of the inner ring lattice and @xmath33 is the size of the outer ting lattice .",
    "the source - target pairs and the hubs are located in the outer lattice , with each hub having a connection to a node in the inner lattice . as before a message",
    "is routed along the shortest path @xmath7 - 1-x-2 - 3 - 4 - 5-y-6-@xmath8 in the clockwise direction as shown in fig.[fig_sim2](a ) .",
    "we study the travel time distribution of messages which are flowing on the lattice .",
    "the travel time is defined to be the time required for a message to travel from source to target , including the time spent waiting at congested hubs .",
    "a given number @xmath9 of source and target pairs start sending @xmath9 messages continuously at every @xmath34 time steps for a total run time of @xmath35 . in our simulation the travel time is calculated for a source - target separation of @xmath13 on a @xmath36 and @xmath37 double ring lattice , and averaged over @xmath38 hub realizations .",
    "the distribution of travel times of messages shows bimodal behaviour .",
    "the peak at higher travel times shows gaussian behavior whereas the peak at lower travel time shows log - normal behavior . in the case of the @xmath0 ring ,",
    "crossover from gaussian to log - normal behavior was observed during the congestion - decongestion transition in the @xmath0 ring lattice @xcite .",
    "hence we conclude that the gaussian peak at higher travel times for the double ring corresponds to the initial congestion in the system , whereas the log - normal peak at lower travel times corresponds to the later decongested stage .",
    "to summarize , we have studied message transport on model communication network of ordinary nodes and hubs , embedded on a ring lattice .",
    "the properties of message traffic on such a lattice is largely consistent with the real world networks like the internet .",
    "the power spectral analysis of load time series data shows @xmath1 type fluctuations confirming long - ranged correlation in the network load time series , which is also seen in real life networks . for the baseline mechanism the inter arrival time distribution of messages",
    "show a stretched exponential behavior",
    ". the behavior changes to a power law if random assortative connections are introduced in the lattice .",
    "we also studied a variation of the ring lattice , namely the double ring lattice .",
    "the travel time distribution is bimodal , with one gaussian peak and one log - normal peak",
    ". it would be interesting to see if our results have relevance in real life communication networks like telephone networks , biological networks etc .",
    "we thank csir , india for support under their extra - mural scheme .",
    "the authors also thank a. prabhakar for helpful suggestions and comments ."
