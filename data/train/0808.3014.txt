    "the microlensing signal of a planet is a perturbation to the smooth standard light curve of the primary - induced lensing event occurring on a background source star .",
    "the planetary signal lasts for a short period of time : several days for a gas giant planet and several hours for an earth - mass planet .",
    "currently , the observational frequency of lensing surveys is @xmath4 per night and thus it is not enough to detect planetary signals . to achieve the observational frequency required to detect planetary signals , microlensing",
    "planet searches are using a combination of survey and follow - up observations .",
    "survey observations ( e.g. , ogle , http://www.astrouw.edu.pl/@xmath5ogle , @xcite ; moa , http://www.physics.canterbury.ac.nz/moa/ , @xcite ) aim to maximize the event rate by monitoring a large area of the galactic bulge field on a roughly nightly basis .",
    "they issue alerts of ongoing events in the early stage of lensing magnification by analyzing data in real time .",
    "follow - up observations ( e.g. , planet , http://planet.iap.fr , @xcite ; microfun , http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/%7emicrofun/ , @xcite ) are focused on the alerted events in order to detect short - lived planetary signals .    in practice",
    ", however , the number of telescopes available for follow - up observations is far less for intensive followups of all alerted events and thus priority is given to those events which will maximize the planetary detection probability .",
    "currently , the highest priority is given to high - magnification events @xcite .",
    "this is based on the fact that in addition to a major caustic located away from the primary lens ( planetary caustic ) , a planet induces an additional tiny caustic in the region close to the primary lens ( stellar or central caustic ) . due to its location",
    ", the perturbations induced by the stellar caustic always occur near the peak of high - magnification events and this makes follow - up observations right on the period of greatest sensitivity possible .",
    "the strategy focusing on high - magnification events was proposed by @xcite and the adoption of the strategy has led to the discoveries of six planet candidates ( ogle-2005-blg-071 lb , ogle-2005-blg-169 lb , ogle-2006-blg-109lb , c , moa-2007-blg-400b , moa-2007-blg-192 ) among the total eight microlensing planet candidates discovered to date @xcite .    in planetary microlensing ,",
    "a ` lensing zone ' refers to the range of planet - star separations where the probability of detecting a planetary signal is high .",
    "it was first discussed by @xcite , who found that the planet detection probability is maximized when the planet is near the einstein radius of the primary star .",
    "later , the definition of the lensing zone is refined by @xcite and @xcite as the range between approximately 0.6 and 1.6 einstein radii of the primary lens . in defining the lensing zone ,",
    "the location of a caustic is important because perturbations can be covered by follow - up observations when they occur during the progress of the lensing magnification induced by the primary star .",
    "when a planet is located within this range , not only the size of the planet - induced caustic is maximized but also the caustic is located inside the einstein ring of the primary lens . however , this definition of the lensing zone is based only on the location of the planetary caustic .",
    "considering that current lensing observations focus on perturbations induced by stellar caustics and these caustics are always located within the einstein ring regardless of the planet - star separation , a new definition of the lensing zone is needed . in this paper , we determine the range of a lensing zone for microlensing planets detectable through the channel of high - magnification events .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in   2 , we briefly describe the properties of planet - induced caustics . in   3 , we investigate the patterns of lensing magnifications in the central region of planetary lens systems with various planet / star mass ratios and planet - star separations . from the investigation of the magnification pattern , we set the criterion for planet detections and determine the lensing zone based on this criterion .",
    "we discuss about the implication of the determined lensing zone .",
    "we summarize the result and conclude in   4 .",
    "a planetary lensing corresponds to the case of binary lensing with a very low mass companion . one important characteristic of binary lensing is the formation of caustics .",
    "caustics represent the set of source positions at which the magnification of a point source becomes infinite . for a planetary case ,",
    "there exist two sets of disconnected caustics .",
    "one small stellar caustic is located near the primary star and the other planetary caustic is located away from the star .",
    "the position vector to the center of the planetary caustic from the position of the primary lens is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the position vector of the planet from the star normalized by the einstein radius of the primary , @xmath8 .",
    "the einstein radius is related to the physical parameters of the lens system by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the mass of the primary lens and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the distances to the lens and source star , respectively .",
    "then , the planetary caustic is located within the einstein ring for planets located in the range of @xmath13 this range corresponds to the lensing zone defined by @xcite and @xcite",
    ". more details about the characteristics of planetary caustics are found in @xcite .",
    "the stellar caustic is smaller than the planetary caustic .",
    "its size as measured by the width along the planet - star axis is related to the planet / star mass ratio @xmath14 and planet - star separation @xmath15 by @xmath16 the size of the stellar caustic decreases as @xmath17 , while the size of the planetary caustic decreases as @xmath18 .",
    "this implies that the stellar caustic shrinks more rapidly than the planetary caustic as the mass ratio decreases . in the limiting case of a very wide planet ( @xmath19 ) and a close - in planet ( @xmath20 ) ,",
    "the dependency of the size of the stellar caustic on the planet separation is @xmath21 for a given mass ratio , a pair of stellar caustics with separations @xmath15 and @xmath22 are identical to the first order of perturbation approximation .",
    "although the size depends both on @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the shape of the stellar caustic is solely dependent on the planet separation . for more detailed characteristics of stellar caustics ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "since the stellar caustic is always close to the primary lens , its location can no longer be a criterion for the the determination of the lensing zone for planets detectable through the channel of high - magnification events .",
    "for these planets , the most important restriction on planet detection is the size of the caustic . if the caustic is too small , the perturbation produced by the caustic is severely washed out by the finite - source effect and thus can not be detected @xcite . since the stellar caustic is small , perturbations induced by the stellar caustic are especially vulnerable to the finite - source effect .    to see how the finite - source effect affects planetary perturbations , we construct maps of magnification pattern in the central region of planetary systems with various mass ratios and separations .",
    "the constructed maps are presented in figure  [ fig : one ] and figure [ fig : two ] . for comparison , we present two sets of maps where the maps presented in figure  [ fig : one ] are constructed not considering the finite - source effect , while those presented in figure  [ fig : two ] are constructed by considering the effect .",
    "the finite - source effect is parameterized by the ratio of the source radius , @xmath23 , to the einstein radius of the primary lens . for galactic bulge events ,",
    "this ratio is scaled by the physical parameters of the lens system as @xmath24^{-1/2}. \\label{eq6}\\ ] ] we consider the finite - source effect by assuming that the source star has a uniform disk with a radius equivalent to the sun and the physical parameters of the lens system are @xmath25 , @xmath26 kpc , and @xmath27 kpc by adopting the values of a typical galactic bulge event .",
    "this results in @xmath28 .",
    "then , the magnification affected by the finite - source effect becomes @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the displacement vector of the source center with respect to the lens , @xmath31 is the vector to a position on the source star surface with respect to the center of the source star , @xmath32 represents the surface brightness profile of the source star , and @xmath33 is the point - source magnification .",
    "we note that the blank space with missing panels in figure  [ fig : one ] and figure  [ fig : two ] implies that the magnification pattern is difficult to be distinguished from that of a single - lensing case . we also note that maps are presented only for the cases with @xmath34 because the magnification patterns for a pair of planetary systems with @xmath15 and @xmath22 are identical @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : three ] , we present example light curves of high - magnification events .",
    "the source trajectories responsible for the individual events are marked in the corresponding panels of figure  [ fig : two ] . in each panel , there are two light curves .",
    "one is for planetary lensing event ( black curve ) and the other is for a single - lensing event without the planet ( red curve ) .",
    "also presented in figure  [ fig : four ] are the maps of magnification excess , which represents the fractional deviation of the planetary lensing magnification @xmath35 from the single - lensing magnification @xmath36 , i.e. @xmath37 we note that the finite - source effect is taken into consideration for both @xmath35 and @xmath36 . in each excess map",
    ", the region with bluish colors represents the area where the planetary lensing magnification is lower than that of the single lensing , i.e.  @xmath38 , while the region with brownish colors represents the area where the planetary lensing magnification is higher , i.e.  @xmath39 .",
    "the individual colored areas represent the regions with @xmath40 , 3% , 5% , and 10% , respectively , with thickening tones of color .",
    "the pattern of central perturbations depends both on the shape of the stellar caustic and its relative size to that of the source star .",
    "we conduct detailed investigation about the dependencies of perturbation pattern on the caustic shape and size .",
    "the results of this investigation are themselves very important for the understanding of central perturbations and thus we are preparing a separate paper for that . although the detailed results of this work are not presented in this paper , several findings relevant to this work are ( 1 ) the dependency of the finite - source effect on the caustic shape is weak and ( 2 ) perturbations persist even when the caustic is substantially smaller than the source size .",
    "specifically , we find that perturbations with @xmath41 can be detected if the caustic is bigger than roughly one fourth of the source size ( diameter ) , i.e. , @xmath42 .",
    "this result is consistent with the case of a recently reported microlensing planet moa-2007-blg-400b that was discovered through the high - magnification channel @xcite . in this case ,",
    "the caustic width is @xmath43 and the source diameter is @xmath44 and thus the ratio of the caustic width to the source diameter is @xmath45 . by adopting the criterion of planet detection as @xmath46 and with the expression of the caustic size in equation  ( [ eq4 ] ) , the condition for planet detection is @xmath47 or equivalently , @xmath48 solving this relation results in an analytic expression for the lensing zone of central perturbations of @xmath49    ccc @xmath50 & @xmath51 & @xmath52 + @xmath53 & @xmath54 & @xmath55 + @xmath56 & @xmath57 & @xmath58 + @xmath59 & @xmath60 & @xmath61 + @xmath62 & @xmath63 & @xmath64    in figure  [ fig : five ] , we present the determined lensing zone ( shaded area ) in the parameter space of @xmath65 . from the comparison of the lensing zone of central perturbations with that of perturbations produced by planetary caustics",
    ", it is found that the lensing zone of central perturbations varies depending on the mass ratio unlike the fixed range of the classical lensing zone regardless of the mass ratio . , we find that this effect makes the lensing zone increase by @xmath66 assuming that the perturbation region extends 4 times of the caustic size . ]",
    "this is because while the position of the planetary caustic , which is the criterion for the classical lensing zone , does not depend on the mass ratio , the size of the stellar caustic , which is the criterion for the lensing zone of central perturbations , varies depending on the mass ratio .",
    "the dependency is such that a heavier planet has a wider lensing zone .    in table",
    "[ table : one ] , we list lensing zones for several cases of planets .",
    "we find that the lensing zone of central perturbations is equivalent to the classical lensing zone for a planet with a mass ratio @xmath67 . for planets with mass ratios greater than this ,",
    "the lensing zone of central perturbations is wider than the classical lensing zone .",
    "for example , the lensing zone of a planet with @xmath68 , which corresponds to a jupiter - mass planet around a low - mass star with @xmath69 , ranges from @xmath70 . in physical units",
    ", this range corresponds to @xmath71 for a typical galactic bulge event . considering the mass of the primary star ,",
    "this lensing zone is equivalent to the range encompassing mars to uranus in our solar system when the dimension is scaled by the mass ratio of the lens to the sun .",
    "the wider lensing zone of giant planets implies that microlensing method provides an important tool to detect planetary systems composed of multiple ice - giant planets .",
    "this is because all planets located within the lensing zone will produce their own signatures at a common area of the central perturbation @xcite . in this sense , the recent discovery of a planetary system with a jupiter / saturn analog by the microlensing method @xcite is not a fluke and we predict that microlensing will discover more of such multiple planetary systems in the future if they are common .",
    "while the convention of defining the range of planet separation detectable by the microlensing method is based on the location of the planet - induced caustic , the range for planets detectable through the channel of high - magnification events can not be defined by the conventional criterion because the caustic is always located close to the primary lens regardless of the planet separation . instead",
    ", the most important restriction to the detection of central perturbation is given by the finite - source effect .",
    "we investigated the magnification pattern in the central region of various planetary systems and found that perturbations with @xmath1 can be detected if the caustic is bigger than roughly one fourth of the caustic size .",
    "based on this finding , we derived an analytic expression for the range of planetary separations detectable through the central perturbations . from the comparison of classical lensing zone",
    ", we found that the new lensing zone is equivalent to the classical zone for a planet with a planet / star mass ratio @xmath2 and it becomes wider for heavier planets .",
    "the wider lensing zone of the central perturbations for giant planets implies that the microlensing method provides an important tool to detect planetary systems composed of multiple ice - giant planets .",
