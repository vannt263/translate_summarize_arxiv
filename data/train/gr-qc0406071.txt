    "one of the basis components of laser gravitational - wave antennae @xcite are high - reflectivity mirrors with multilayer dielectric coating .",
    "recent researches @xcite have shown that fluctuations of the coating thickness produced by , in particular , brownian and thermoelastic noise in a coating , can introduce substantial part of the total noise budget of the future laser gravitational - wave antennae . for example ,",
    "estimates , done in @xcite show that the thermoelastic noise value can be close to the standard quantum limit ( sql ) @xcite which corresponds to the sensitivity level of the advanced ligo project @xcite or even can exceed it in some frequency range .",
    "for this reason it was proposed in @xcite to replace end mirrors by coatingless corner reflectors .",
    "it was shown in this article that by using these reflectors , it is possible , in principle , to obtain sensitivity much better than the sql .",
    "however , the corner reflectors require substantial redesign of the gravitational - wave antennae core optics and suspension system .    at the same time",
    ", the value of the mirror surface fluctuations depends on the number of dielectric layers which form the coating .",
    "it can be explained in the following way .",
    "the most of the light is reflected from the first couple of the layers . at the same time",
    ", fluctuations of the mirror surface are created by the thickness fluctuations of all underlying layers , and the larger is the layers number , the larger is the surface noise .",
    "therefore , the surface fluctuations are relatively small for the input mirrors ( itm ) of the fabry - perot cavities of the laser gravitational - wave antennae with only a few coating layers and @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the mirror power reflectivity ) , and is considerably larger for the end mirrors ( etm ) with coating layers number @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "[ ct][lb]@xmath4 [ ct][lb]@xmath5 [ cb][lb]itm [ cb][lb]ietm [ cb][lb]eetm        in this paper another , less radical way of reducing the coating noise , exploiting this feature , is proposed .",
    "it is based on the use of an additional short fabry - perot cavity instead of the end mirror ( see fig.[fig : fabry_dbl_mirror ] ) .",
    "it should be tuned in anti - resonance , _",
    "i.e _ its optical length @xmath6 should be close to @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a wavelength .",
    "the back side of the first mirror have to have a few layers of an antireflection coating .",
    "it can be shown that in this case reflectivity of this cavity will be defined by the following equation :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 are the reflectivities of the first ( eetm on fig.[fig : fabry_dbl_mirror ] ) and the second ( ietm ) mirrors .",
    "phase shift in the reflected beam produced by small variations @xmath11 in position of the second mirror reflecting surface relative to the first one will be equal to    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is a wave number .",
    "it is supposed for simplicity that there is no absorption in the first mirror material ; more general formulae are presented below .",
    "it follows from these formulae that the first mirror can have a moderate value of reflectivity and , therefore , a small number of coating layers . in particular , it can be identical to the input mirror of the main fabry - perot cavity ( itm ) . at the same time , influence of the coating noise of the second ( very - high - reflective ) mirror will be suppressed by a factor of @xmath14 , which can be as small as @xmath15 .",
    "[ cb][lb]etm        in principle , another design of the double reflector is possible , which consists of one mirror only , see fig.[fig : single_mirror ] . both surfaces of this mirror have to have reflective coatings : the thin one on the face side and the thick one on the back side . in this case the additional fabry - perot cavity is created _ inside _ this mirror . however , in this case thermoelastic fluctuations of the the back surface coating will bend the mirror and thus will create unacceptable large mechanical fluctuations of the face surface .",
    "estimates show that using this design , it possible to reduce the face surface fluctuations by factor @xmath16 only @xcite .",
    "so the design with two _ mechanically isolated _ reflectors only will be considered here .    in the next section more detail analysis of this system",
    "is presented .",
    "[ rc][lb]@xmath17 [ rc][lb]@xmath18 [ lc][lb]@xmath19 [ lc][lb]@xmath20 [ lc][lb]@xmath21 [ lc][lb]@xmath22 [ rc][lb]@xmath23 [ rc][lb]@xmath24 [ cb][lb]ietm [ cb][lb]eetm        the rightmost part of fig.[fig : fabry_dbl_mirror ] is presented in fig.[fig : dbl_mirror ] , where the following notation is used :    @xmath25 are the amplitudes of the incident and reflected waves for the first mirror , respectively ;    @xmath26 are the amplitudes of the waves traveling in the left and right directions , respectively , just behind the first mirror coating ;    @xmath27 are the same for the waves just behind the first mirror itself ;    @xmath28 are the amplitudes of the incident and reflected waves for the second mirror , respectively .",
    "these amplitudes satisfy the following equations :    [ main_eqs ] @xmath29    where :    @xmath30 are independent zero - point oscillations generated in the first ( @xmath31 ) and the second ( @xmath32 ) mirrors ;    @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the distance between the first mirror back surface and the second mirror ;    @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the amplitude reflectivity and transmittance of the first mirror coating , respectively , @xmath37 ;    @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the amplitude transmittance and absorption of the first mirror bulk , respectively , @xmath40 ;    @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the amplitude reflectivity and absorption of the second mirror , respectively , @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath44 are real values ; @xmath38 is a complex one , its argument corresponds to the phase shift in the first mirror bulk .    here",
    "we do not consider absorption in the first mirror coating for two reasons : ( i ) it is relatively small and ( ii ) it exists both in traditional one - mirror reflectors and in the one considered here , and the main goal of this short article is to emphasize the _ differences _ between these two types of reflectors .",
    "we also suppose that the mirrors move rather slowly :    @xmath45    in the case of the gravitational - wave signal characteristic frequencies @xmath46 and relatively short length @xmath47 this inequality is fulfilled pretty well .",
    "it follows from equations ( [ main_eqs ] ) that the reflected beam amplitude is equal to    @xmath48    this solution can be presented in the following form :    @xmath49    where    @xmath50    is the equivalent complex reflection factor for the scheme considered ,    @xmath51    is its equivalent absorption factor , and    @xmath52    is the sum noise normalized as zero - point fluctuations .    as mentioned above , this system should be tuned in anti - resonance :    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is an integer and @xmath55 . in this case",
    "@xmath56    and    @xmath57    where    @xmath58    and    @xmath59    is the phase shift produced by the deviation @xmath11 in the distance @xmath6 .",
    "suppose that factors @xmath60 are small .",
    "in this case    @xmath61    @xmath62    using power reflection and absorption factors instead of the amplitude ones :    @xmath63    equations ( [ r_amp ] ) , ( [ phi_amp ] ) can be rewritten as follows :    @xmath64    @xmath65",
    "the main goal of this short article is just to claim the idea , so the detailed design of the additional cavity is not presented here .",
    "however , the following important topics have to be discussed in brief .",
    "the first one concerns the optimal value of the ietm mirror reflectivity .",
    "the smaller is @xmath66 , the larger is suppression factor for the eetm mirror surface noises ; at the same time , the larger is the ietm mirror coating noise .",
    "the rigorous optimization requires exact knowledge of the coating noise dependence on the coating layers number .",
    "a crude estimate based in the exponential dependence of the ietm mirror transmittance @xmath67 on the coating layers number gives that the optimal transmittance value is relatively large , @xmath68 . on the other hand , smaller values of the ietm mirror transmittance ,",
    "down to the input ( itm ) mirror transmittance @xmath69 are also acceptable .",
    "therefore , identical itm and ietm mirrors can be used .    in the advanced ligo interferometer",
    ", the input mirrors transmittance will be equal to @xmath70 , and its bulk absorption will be equal to @xmath71 @xcite . using such mirror as an ietm mirror in the scheme proposed in this article , and mirror with commercially available value of @xmath72 as an eetm mirror , it is possible to create a double - mirror reflector with @xmath73 and suppression factor for the eetm surface fluctuations @xmath74 .",
    "the second issue concerns the optical power circulating through the ietm mirror .",
    "it is easy to show using equations ( [ main_eqs ] ) , that it is @xmath75 times smaller that the power circulating in the main cavities . in the advanced ligo topology",
    ", it will be approximately equal to the power circulating through the itm mirrors and the beamsplitter ( about 1kw ) .",
    "it is necessary to note also that @xmath11 in the calculations presented above includes not only coating noise of the eetm mirror but all possible kinds of its surface fluctuations , including ones caused by brownian and thermoelastic fluctuations in this mirror bulk , brownian fluctuation in its suspension , seismic noise as well as the mirror quantum fluctuations .",
    "this feature simplifies greatly the eetm mirror design because the requirements for all these noise sources can be reduced by a factor of @xmath14 .",
    "in particular , the sql value @xmath76 for this mirror ( @xmath77 is its mass and @xmath78 is the observation frequency ) can be larger by a factor of @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , its mass can be , in principle , @xmath80 times smaller than for the main ( itm and ietm ) mirrors .",
    "of course , such a small mirror hardly can be used in the real interferometer .",
    "this estimates shows only that the quantum noise does not impose any practical limitation on the @xmath81 mirror mass .",
