    "among the unusual characteristics of dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies is the apparent lack of any interstellar gas , even in systems such as fornax or carina , where star formation occurred in the last 1 to 3  gyr ( skillman & bender 1995 ; also see reviews by gallagher & wyse 1994 ; mateo 1998 ; grebel 1999 ) .",
    "stetson , hesser , & smecker - hane ( 1998 ) find a sequence of stars in color - magnitude diagram of the fornax dsph that appears to be only a few times @xmath8 yrs old .",
    "the major exception to this trend may be the sculptor dsph , where an hi cloud could be associated with the galaxy ( carignan et al .",
    "1998 ; carignan 1999 ) .",
    "recent sensitive 21  cm hi observations by young ( 1999 , 2000 ) yielded upper limits on any diffuse neutral gas at column densities of @xmath9  @xmath10 , implying that any distributed gas would have low mean volume density and therefore could be ionized .",
    "bowen et al . ( 1997 ) searched for a hot ionized ism in the outskirts of the leo i dsph by seeking interstellar ultraviolet lines with no detection , thereby setting ionized gas column density limits along two sight lines to background qsos similar to those of the hi surveys .",
    "gizis , mould and djorgovsky ( 1993 ) studied the fornax dsph with _",
    "rosat _ and found no extended component that could be associated with very hot gas and set a limit of @xmath11  m@xmath12 .",
    "the limits on interstellar gas column densities from the ultraviolet and hi observations correspond to gas masses of @xmath13  m@xmath12 or @xmath51% of the estimated stellar mass ( see grebel , gallagher , & harbeck 2003 ) . as noted by young ( 2000 ) ,",
    "even if gas were initially removed from a dsph at the time that its star formation ceased , mass loss from stars should have replenished the interstellar medium to detectable levels .",
    "evidently , dsphs either lose essentially all their interstellar gas or their interstellar gas lies in a form that has yet to be detected . for example , their gas could reside in dense , cold clumps or be nearly fully ionized but at a moderate temperature @xmath14  k that can be sustained by photoionization . in either case ,",
    "substantial amounts of gas could escape detection by previous hi , x - ray , and ultraviolet absorption line studies . in this paper",
    "we report results from observations with the highly - sensitive wisconsin h@xmath0  mapper ( wham ) with the goal of detecting h@xmath0  emission from ionized interstellar matter in the draco and ursa minor dsphs .",
    "no emission is found to sensitive limits , and we discuss the implications of these results .",
    "we have used wham to search for the h@xmath0  emission from the draco and ursa minor dsphs .",
    "the wham instrument is a spectrometer located at the kitt peak national observatory and is remotely operated from madison , wisconsin .",
    "wham consists of a 0.6 m siderostat coupled to a 15 cm dual - etalon fabry - perot system ( tufte 1997 ; reynolds et al .",
    "it produces an optical spectrum integrated over its circular , 1@xmath4  diameter field of view within a 200 kms@xmath1  wide spectral window , centered on any wavelength between 4800   and 7400  , with a resolution of 12 kms@xmath1 .",
    "wham was designed to detect very faint emission lines from the diffuse interstellar medium , and is capable of detecting h@xmath0  emission down to an emission measure of @xmath15@xmath16 pc .",
    "it s capabilities are well - matched to surveys for faint diffuse h@xmath0  emission from extended sources , such as the galactic satellite dsph galaxies .",
    "we chose to study the draco and ursa minor dsphs since they are the closest northern examples of these systems .",
    "our wham observations were all taken on the night of 2002 may 6 , and employed an on minus off technique . in order to accurately remove the contamination of the spectra by faint atmospheric lines ( madsen et al . 2001 ; hausen et al . 2002 )",
    ", the observations were alternated between the galaxies ( ons ) , and a couple of directions ( offs ) a few degrees away from the ons .",
    "the off directions were checked to ensure that no potential systematic contaminants , i.e. bright stars or high velocity hi gas , were present within the 200 kms@xmath1  spectral window .",
    "each individual observation was 120 s , and the total integration time toward each on direction was 78 min .",
    "the average of the off spectra was subtracted from the average of the corresponding on spectra to yield spectra of the galaxies which minimized the contamination by atmospheric lines .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show the resultant h@xmath0  spectra toward the draco and ursa minor dsphs , respectively .",
    "the spectra were corrected for atmospheric and internal transmission effects , and their intensities calibrated using synoptic observations of a portion of the north america nebula , which has an intensity @xmath17photons  @xmath10  sec@xmath1  sr @xmath1 ] ( scherb 1981 ) .",
    "the velocity scales were calibrated using a bright atmospheric oh line near -420 kms@xmath1with respect to h@xmath0 .",
    "the x - axis of each plot is heliocentric velocity , and the y - axis is milli - rayleighs per kms@xmath1 .",
    "the spectra in figures 1 and 2 show no statistically significant emission lines , providing only upper limits to the h@xmath0  emission from these galaxies . to estimate these upper limits , we assume an emission line exists at the heliocentric velocities of each of the dsph systems , -293 kms@xmath1  for draco and -248 kms@xmath1  for ursa minor ( armandroff , olszewski , & pryor 1995 ) . in order to set a limit on the expected width of an h@xmath0  line , we assume that the gas would have a velocity dispersion close to that of the stars , which have line - of - sight dispersions of about 10 kms@xmath1(e.g . , olszewski , aaronson , & hill 1995 ; armandroff , olszewski , & pryor 1995 ; hargreaves et al 1996 ; kleyna et al .",
    "however , it is likely that the velocity dispersion of the ionized gas would be larger than that of the stars , as the gas receives additional energy input from the host stars as they evolve . furthermore , if we impose the condition that a significant amount of ionized gas is actually present in these galaxies , we can not use a dispersion that is larger than is allowed in order to keep the gas bound in the system ( @xmath19 15  kms@xmath1 ) .",
    "we therefore adopt a dispersion of 15 kms@xmath1  for the h@xmath0  emission line that we attribute to ionized gas bound to the draco and ursa minor dsph galaxies .    adopting the above heliocentric velocities and 15 kms@xmath1  dispersion , we use the observed spectra to constrain the maximum area ( intensity ) of an undetected h@xmath0  line with these parameters .",
    "in particular , we increase the area of the imposed spectra line until the average value of the observed spectra within the fwhm of the line is more than 3@xmath20 below the peak of the imposed line ( see figures 1 and 2 ) . in this sense , we consider the limits to the strengths of the imposed emission lines to be 3@xmath20 upper limits .",
    "we find upper limits of @xmath2r and @xmath21r for the draco and ursa minor dsphs , respectively , averaged over the 1@xmath4  circular wham beam .",
    "these limits are factors of 20 - 50 below the h@xmath0  intensity limits obtained for external galaxies from deep , conventional narrow band filter imaging or spectroscopy ( e.g. , ferguson et al .",
    "1996 ; hoopes , walterbos , & rand 1999 ) , albeit at the price of the low angular resolution required to increase our sensitivity , but with the advantage of precision radial velocity information .",
    "we note that these results were derived using uncertainties arising only from the random errors ( i.e. photon statistics ) , whereas the systematic uncertainties from the incomplete subtraction of atmospheric lines may also contribute to the overall error measurements , particularly with the location of the continuum .",
    "however , we have little understanding of the origin and variability of these lines .",
    "given that these random errors account for point - to - point variation in the data , and that a straight line fit to the spectra , i.e. a spectrum with no features , yields a @xmath22 , we conclude that the contribution of systematic errors to our upper limits is minimal .",
    "however , it is not clear if significantly deeper observations can be obtained with wham , as systematic errors are likely to become important for longer observations .",
    "an additional consideration regarding these upper limits is extinction of the h@xmath0  emission by interstellar dust in the galaxy .",
    "however , according to the nasa extragalactic database , the predicted galactic extinction at h@xmath0  toward the draco ( @xmath23 ) and ursa minor ( @xmath24 ) dsphs is less than 10% .",
    "furthermore , the variation in galactic extinction across the projected angular extent of the draco dsph is negligible ( odenkirchen et al .",
    "2001 ) we do not make any correction for galactic extinction .    another possible systematic error could be photospheric h@xmath0  absorption by the stars in the host galaxies themselves .",
    "this dip in the background stellar continuum would tend to reduce the measured intensity of any h@xmath0  emission feature from the ionized gas . to estimate the magnitude of this effect",
    ", we consider a completely saturated h@xmath0  absorption line at the velocity of the host galaxy .",
    "the strength of such a saturated line , as observed by wham , is at most equal to the surface brightness , or continuum level , of the galaxy .",
    "the apparent total @xmath25 magnitudes of the draco and ursa minor dsphs , @xmath26 , are 10.1 and 10.3 , respectively ( grebel et al 2003 ) . in the limit where this light uniformly fills the wham 1@xmath4  beam",
    ", we derive surface brightnesses of 0.7 @xmath27  at h@xmath28 and 0.5 @xmath27 . using a line width of 50 kms@xmath1  ( 1  )",
    ", we find conservative upper limits of 0.003 and 0.002 r for the strength of an h@xmath0  absorption line .",
    "given that such a line is not likely to be completely saturated in these systems , and that the line width at the core may be overestimated , it is likely that any absorption line would be even weaker than these limits .",
    "we therefore have not taken into account any correction for an internal stellar h@xmath0  absorption feature .      with these upper limits of @xmath29 in hand",
    ", we estimate the total mass of ionized gas in these galaxies . at a temperature of @xmath30",
    "k , 1  r of h@xmath0  emission corresponds to an emission measure of @xmath31 .",
    "if we assume that the gas uniformly fills a fraction @xmath32 of a cylinder of length @xmath33 along the line of sight , we use the definition of emission measure @xmath34 : @xmath35 where the beam efficiency @xmath36 is given by the ratio of the circular 1@xmath4  diameter wham field to the solid angle subtended by the source .",
    "the electron density is @xmath37 if we further assume that the gas only fills a sphere of radius @xmath38 within this cylinder , then the geometric filling factor is @xmath39 , so that with an internal gas filling factor on small spatial scales of @xmath40 , then the total filling factor is @xmath41 .",
    "the mass of ionized gas @xmath42 within a volume @xmath25 is given by @xmath43 with the mass of the hydrogen atom @xmath44 , and the correction factor to include helium @xmath45 .",
    "placing the emission within a sphere with @xmath39 and combining the above relations then yields @xmath46 @xmath47 where the radius @xmath48 is measured in parsecs .    to compute conservative limits",
    "we assume that the ionized gas , if present , has a spherical distribution with radius equal to the tidal radius and an internal volume filling factor of @xmath49 by analogy to conditions in the galactic diffuse ionized gas ( reynolds 1977 ) .",
    "this model is based on the assumption that any gas beyond the tidal radius would be lost ( see blitz & robishaw 2000 ) .",
    "we adopt a tidal radius of @xmath50  arcmin and a distance @xmath51  kpc for ursa minor ( kleyna et al .",
    "1998 ; see also carrera et al .",
    "2002 ) , and @xmath52  arcmin with @xmath53  kpc for draco ( odenkirchen et al . 2001 ) .",
    "we then have @xmath54 1 for both galaxies and @xmath55  pc and 930  pc , respectively for the ursa minor and draco dsphs . since we do not detect any emission , we do not correct for the elliptical shapes of these two galaxies , which could reduce @xmath36 and increase in the upper mass limits by 20 - 25% , if the gas had the same projected distribution as the stars but with uniform intensity .",
    "incorporating these data into eq.(4 ) result in 3-@xmath20 upper limits to the ionized gas mass in ursa minor of @xmath56 and in draco of @xmath57 .",
    "if we instead assumed that the ionized gas is confined to the galaxies core regions , these values would be reduced by about a factor of 5 .",
    "if h@xmath0  emission is present at its upper limit , we can assume ionization equilibrium to estimate the flux of ionizing photons required to produce this amount of h@xmath0  emission .",
    "for a given @xmath29 in rayleighs , the corresponding flux of lyman continuum photons @xmath58 incident on the surface of the galaxies is given by @xmath59}\\ ] ] where the factor of 2.05 comes from the number of lyman continuum photons need to produce one h@xmath0  photon via photoionization ( osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "the upper limit on @xmath29 derived for these two dsph galaxies would thus correspond to @xmath60  photons @xmath61  s@xmath1 .",
    "the total rate of lyman continuum photons q incident upon a galaxy having a projected area a is then @xmath62.}\\ ] ] for the projected areas ( @xmath63 ) of these galaxies , we thus find lyman continuum photon rates of @xmath64  photons  s@xmath1 and @xmath65  photons  s@xmath1 for the draco and ursa minor dsphs , respectively .",
    "the hot stellar populations in the draco and ursa minor dsphs , unfortunately , are poorly known .",
    "given their dominant old stellar populations , hot stars arise from evolved low mass stars .",
    "for example , ursa minor has a predominantly blue horizontal branch ( e.g. , kleyna et al .",
    "1998 ; bellazzini et al . 2002 ) while that in draco the red horizontal branch is much stronger ( odenkirchen et al .",
    "2001 ; aparicio , a. , carrera , & martinez - delgado 2001 ) , and both galaxies should be producing white dwarfs .",
    "it is also possible that the milky way could ionize gas in these nearby dsphs .",
    "however , at the 70 - 80  kpc distances of these galaxies , it is unclear what the milky way s ionizing flux is .",
    "detections of h@xmath0  emission from hi clouds at distances of 10 - 50  kpc within the galactic halo suggest an escaping flux @xmath66  photons @xmath61  s@xmath1 ( tufte et al .",
    "1998 ; bland - hawthorne and maloney 1999 ) .",
    "even the cosmic background may be sufficient to maintain ionization near our observed limit .",
    "from wham h@xmath0  observations of the outer hi disk of m31 madsen et al .",
    "( 2001 ) set an upper limit of @xmath67  photons @xmath61  s@xmath1 for the cosmic background in the local group .",
    "note that assuming the galaxies are spheres , then @xmath58 as defined in our paper is four times larger than the @xmath68 definition adopted by madsen et al .",
    "therefore , the cosmic background radiation field is sufficient to maintain an ionized ism of substantial mass in the draco and ursa minor dsphs even in the absence of stellar photoionization from the galaxies themselves or from the milky way .",
    "table 1 lists the estimated stellar masses and limits on gas masses for the draco and ursa minor dsphs .",
    "these results show that the hi limits now are at the level of @xmath691% of the stellar mass , while our new hii results place limits of order @xmath5 10% of the stellar mass .",
    "furthermore , we find that current estimates of the background ionization rate would allow gas masses near our limits to be maintained in an ionized state even without additional energy inputs from the dsph stellar populations , which are unlikely to be completely negligible ( e.g. , burkert & ruiz - lapuente 1997 )",
    ".    therefore , the old and extremely dim ursa minor and draco dsphs could harbor considerable amounts of ionized interstellar matter .",
    "it is interesting to compare our limits with theoretical expectations .",
    "unfortunately , it is unclear how much gas should be left over after early epochs of star formation in a small dwarf galaxy .",
    "several possibilities exist for the evolution of interstellar matter in dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , skillman & bender 1995 ) .",
    "currently available theoretical models suggest that populations of cool gas in clouds can survive star formation and associated supernovae over cosmic time spans in dwarf galaxies , where galaxies with more dark matter should be better able to retain their gas ( e.g. hirashita 1999 ; andersen & burkert 2000 ; ferrara & tolstoy 2000 ) ) .",
    "these models suggest that @xmath7010% of the baryonic mass remaining in low mass dwarfs that evolve over @xmath610  gyr in isolation could be in the form of interstellar gas ( lia , carraro , & salucci 2000 ; carraro et al .",
    "2001 ) . in this regard",
    "it is interesting to note that ursa minor and draco may have different dark matter properties .",
    "odenkirchen et al .",
    "( 2001 ) find the outer regions of the draco dsph has a regular structure , suggesting that perturbations induced by the milky way s tidal force are small leading to the conclusion that draco is dominated by its dark matter halo .",
    "the ursa minor dsph , on the other hand , shows evidence for tidal disturbances ( martnez - delgado et al .",
    "2001 ) and may have less dark matter , but also appears to be free of interstellar matter .",
    "a second option is that gas is removed via external processes .",
    "this may happen early on if reionization of the universe cuts off gas supplies to small galaxies , as suggested by some ( barkana & loeb 1999 ; bullock , kravtsov , & weinberg 2000 ; see also review by loeb & barkana 2001 ) but not all models ( e.g. , ricotti , gnedin & shull 2002 ) .",
    "evolution near giant galaxies provides additional opportunities for gas to be removed from dwarfs through ram pressure stripping or tidal effects ( e.g. , sofue 1994 ; grebel , gallagher , & harbeck 2003 ) . since the ursa minor and draco dsphs are near the milky way , they probably experienced gas stripping .",
    "our observations in combination with the hi data appear to rule out the possibility of a massive residual interstellar medium in either the ursa minor or draco dsphs .",
    "we therefore consider how much gas might collect in these systems under the less strict assumption that they were cleaned of gas when their star formation ceased .",
    "evolving stars are the most likely sources of interstellar gas for dsphs orbiting near the milky way . in an old stellar population",
    "the mass loss rate from stars is @xmath71  ( e.g. , schulz , fritze - v .",
    "alvensleben , & 2002 ) . over an @xmath78  gyr span appropriate to the time since star formation stopped in these two dwarfs ( carrera et al .",
    "2002 ; ikuta & arimoto 2002 ) , we expect about 5% of the stellar mass to return to the interstellar medium .",
    "a significant fraction of the gas returned by stars therefore can not be in the form of hi , but even with our new limits , this material could remain hidden in a diffuse ionized interstellar medium .    of course , not all of the gas ejected by stars into the very empty interstellar space of a dwarf spheroidal system necessarily will remain in the galaxy",
    ". ram pressure stripping can be highly effective if the orbits of dsphs take them within @xmath69 50  kpc of the milky way ( sofue 1994 ; grebel , gallagher , & harbeck 2003 ) .",
    "thus the possibility remains that dsphs close to giants , like ursa minor and draco , are nearly gas - free systems ; our new observations do not disprove this option .    in summary",
    ", we obtained 1@xmath4  angular resolution wham observations of the integrated h@xmath0   line fluxes from the draco and ursa minor dsph companions of the milky way at their optical radial velocities .",
    "our limits of @xmath72r for draco and @xmath73r for ursa minor are the most sensitive h@xmath0  emission line measurements for dsph galaxies to date .",
    "however , they still allow for the presence of a diffuse ionized interstellar medium with mass approaching 10% of that of the stars , or @xmath610 times that set by the hi 21-cm line limits .",
    "it is possible that even dsphs with dominant old stellar populations , like draco and ursa minor , could contain the bulk of material lost by stars after star - formation activity halted , or they may be periodically cleaned of gas during close encounters with the milky way .",
    "searches for diffuse ionized gas in denser dsphs and dwarf galaxies further from the milky way will help to illuminate solutions to this long - standing mystery . to this end we recently obtained wham observations of the fornax",
