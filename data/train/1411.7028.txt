    "the discovery of a confirmed extrasolar moon remains an outstanding challenge to modern astronomy . despite nearly 2000",
    "exoplanets having now been discovered ( www.exoplanet.eu ; @xcite ) , with some smaller than mercury @xcite , the confirmed existence of a satellite to any of these planets eludes us .",
    "both gravitational microlensing and transit photometry are predicted to be sensitive to `` large '' exomoons ( masses @xmath0@xmath1 ) and yet even a plausible candidate system remains elusive . as an example of the sensitivity from microlensing , @xcite recently identified a system ( moa-2011-blg-262 lb ) which is either composed of a neptune orbiting a late m - dwarf or a terrestrial moon ( @xmath2@xmath1 ) orbiting a super - jupiter , with the moon scenario statistically disfavored . using transits , our project",
    "( the `` hunt for exomoons with kepler '' ; hek ) has published exomoon constraints for 17 transiting planets with six yielding sub - earth mass constraints @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite announced the discovery of the first example of a seven - planet transiting system , kepler-90 ( koi-351 ) .",
    "notably , @xcite discuss the possibility of the 210.6d period planet , kepler-90 g , hosting a large exomoon , largely driven by a moon - like transit signal neighboring the third transit of this gas giant . although @xcite remained cautious and did not claim to have found the first exomoon candidate , the visually apparent moon - like signal remains a mystery and arguably the most plausible evidence for a transiting exomoon in the published literature .",
    "for this reason , as part of the on - going hek project , we here present an investigation of the possible exomoon of kepler-90 g , dubbed kepler-90g.01 in what follows .",
    "we begin our investigation by exploring whether the full set of photometric observations of kepler-90 g can be explained by a planet - moon configuration , which was not attempted by @xcite .",
    "there are two reasons why one might suspect this is not possible .",
    "firstly , there is apparently only one high - significance piece of evidence for kepler-90g.01 , namely the companion transit to kepler-90 g in q6 ( quarter 6 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lightcurve ] .",
    "this raises the question as to whether it is dynamically possible for kepler-90g.01 to avoid imparting a second transit elsewhere for the other five transits of kepler-90 g .",
    "secondly , the transit of kepler-90g.01 is @xmath3hours later than that of kepler-90 g , implying a large planet - moon separation . indeed",
    ", this is the principal reason why @xcite do not consider the moon hypothesis likely , arguing the moon would be on the edge of hill stability .",
    "the seven - planet system , kepler-90 , was observed continuously by the _",
    "kepler_spacecraft from q1 to q17 , except for q8 , q12 and q16 where the target fell off the ccds .",
    "we use all of the available data for this target , including the short - cadence observations where available ( from q9 onwards ) .",
    "the pre - search data conditioning ( pdc ) time series @xcite was downloaded and detrended after first excluding all transits , outliers and manually removing discontinuities ( e.g. ramps ) , in the same way described in our previous papers ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "long - term detrending for the transit photometry of kepler-90 g was handled by the cofiam  algorithm @xcite , protecting timescales less than or equal to the full duration of kepler-90 g ( 12.593hours ; table 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "kepler-90 g exhibits a @xmath41day transit timing variation ( ttv ) for its sixth and final transit , which is far too large to be due to an exomoon alone @xcite . for this reason",
    ", we model the six transits of kepler-90 g using the photodynamical planet - moon code luna  @xcite plus six freely fitted transit times , which are likely due to planet - planet interactions . by fitting the transit times freely ,",
    "any ttvs due to an exomoon are absorbed by these parameters and thus would be degenerate with the moon s mass .",
    "this is particularly salient since ttvs due to an exomoon should dominate a mass determination over transit duration variations ( tdvs ; @xcite ) , due to the visually obvious large separation between the transits of kepler-90 g and kepler-90g.01 , implying a large planet - moon separation . for these reasons ,",
    "the mass of the exomoon is simply set to zero in the photodynamical model ( but the moon radius is still freely fitted ) . as with our previous works ,",
    "we regress our model to the detrended photometry using the multinest  package @xcite , with our priors following those of @xcite .      using the bayesian evidence computed by multinest",
    ", we find a planet+moon+ttvs model is favored over a planet+ttvs model with a formal significance of @xmath5@xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "furthermore , we find that the six transits of kepler-90 g are well - explained by this model , with kepler-90g.01 imparting two dominant signals on the light curve , the originally identified signal during q6 and a second event preceding the first transit of kepler-90 g ( q1 ) , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : lightcurve ] .",
    "the q6 transit of kepler-90g.01 is supported by a change in @xmath8 of @xmath9 over 26 data points .",
    "the q1 transit is far less convincing , imposing a modest improvement of @xmath10 over 15 data points , during a period of increased light curve scatter .",
    "we also note a very minor exomoon feature during the q10 transit of negligible significance .",
    "we therefore conclude that the case for kepler-90g.01 rests solely on the reality of the q6 moon - like transit .",
    "the parameters for the planet - moon system , assuming @xmath11@xmath12 @xcite , indicate a @xmath13@xmath14 planet orbited by @xmath15@xmath14 exomoon at semi - major axis of @xmath16 planetary radii .",
    "we find short - period moons ( @xmath17days ) are prohibited , but otherwise the moon s period posterior distribution is broad , leading to a wide range of possible planet - densities via the technique described in @xcite of @xmath18g@xmath19 to 95% confidence . in the case of kepler-90 g , a more useful constraint on the planet s density comes from demanding the moon orbit within the hill sphere , which requires    @xmath20    where the bracketed terms on the right - hand side are all observables from our light curve model . using our posterior distributions , this constraint imposes @xmath21 .",
    "dynamically speaking , we estimate the seven - planet system is stable if kepler-90 g has a mass @xmath22 , implying the hill sphere can plausibly extend to encompass this moon signal .    since @xmath23 ,",
    "then our limit may be expressed as @xmath24g@xmath19 , where we have used @xmath25g@xmath19 , based on averaging the light curve derived stellar densities from the seven planets in the system .",
    "densities greater than this sub - saturn mean density are certainly plausible for an @xmath26@xmath14 planet .",
    "additionally , for a retrograde moon , @xcite argue moons are stable up to nearly the edge of the hill sphere ( @xmath27% ) .      based on our light curve analysis , we draw the following conclusions .",
    "firstly , the light curve can be well - explained by kepler-90 g hosting a single large exomoon .",
    "although the formal significance is @xmath5@xmath6 , we find that the significance is dominated by the single moon - like transit in q6 , which indicates the need for a careful inspection of this event .",
    "secondly , we find that kepler-90g.01 can be within the hill sphere of the kepler-90 g , if kepler-90 g has a mean density in the range of @xmath28g@xmath19 ( upper limit based on seven - planet stability ) , which is certainly plausible given the radius of @xmath26@xmath14 .",
    "we have now established that the case for an exomoon around kepler-90 g now rests solely on the reality of the q6 moon - like transit .",
    "the usual detection criteria used by the hek project @xcite are less useful for this system , since for example we can not conduct double - likelihood tests by omitting some of the transits , given that there is just one moon - like signal .",
    "low amplitude transit - like events are sometimes imparted into the _ kepler _  time series due to various sources of false positives , ranging from astrophysical to instrumental @xcite .",
    "we confirmed that this signal is coherent in both the pdc and simple aperture photometry ( sap ) data products , using both cofiam  and polynomial detrendings of each .",
    "the moon - like signal is therefore not an artifact of the pdc pipeline , which can occur in rare instances @xcite . using the pixel response function ( prf ; see @xcite ) , precise centroids of each _ kepler _  target are made available as a standard data product .",
    "these may be used to identify certain types of false positive scenarios , such as a background eclipsing binary , and this has become a standard component of the data validation ( dv ) process by the _ kepler _",
    "team @xcite .",
    "during a transit , a large centroid shift indicates that the true eclipsing object is offset from the total flux centroid .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : classiccentroids ] , we show the time series of the @xmath29 ( column ) and @xmath30 ( row ) centroids for kepler-90 during q6 , after detrending with cofiam .",
    "the highlighted areas depict the times when kepler-90 g and kepler-90g.01 are transiting .",
    "both signals appear reasonably consistent with the out - of - transit centroids at a level @xmath31@xmath6 ( the typical threshold in dv reports ) .",
    "we find no compelling reason to reject the possible moon kepler-90g.01 based on this information .",
    "we wished to understand where on the ccd the transits occur and how localized the transit signals were relative to the point spread function . in order to investigate this",
    ", we considered a new type of centroid we dub the `` transit centroid '' . whereas a conventional centroid calculates the mean pixel position weighted by the flux of each pixel , the transit centroid instead weights by the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of the transit depth on each pixel .",
    "since the flux drops away from the flux centroid , causing greater photon noise , the snr should be located at the same position as the flux centroid . if high snr transits are found far away from the flux centroid , this is an indication that the transit is not localized at the expected flux centroid position .",
    "we define the transit centroid position as :    @xmath32    where \\{@xmath33,@xmath34 } is the cartesian location of the center of the @xmath35 pixel , @xmath36 is the transit depth recorded on that pixel and @xmath37 is the associated uncertainty on that transit depth .",
    "for the depth calculation , we simply compute the mean flux within the durations found by our earlier photodynamical fits and use the standard error as the uncertainty .",
    "+     +    the snr of each pixel for the transits of kepler-90 g and kepler-90g.01 during q6 are color coded on fig  [ fig : plancentroid_q6 ] & [ fig : mooncentroid_q6 ] respectively , which may be compared to the total flux centroid shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : totalcentroid_q6 ] .",
    "centroid positions are provided at the top of each panel in fig  [ fig : centroids_q6 ] , with uncertainties estimated using a bootstrap of each pixel s light curve residuals .",
    "although the kepler-90g.01 transit centroid is not significantly offset ( @xmath38@xmath6 ) from the planetary transit , the snr pattern for kepler-90g.01 is quite distinct .",
    "specifically , it is clear that the moon - like signal is not localized at the center of the postage stamp , unlike kepler-90 g , with even pixels on the edges showing high snr levels .",
    "we considered the possibility that the fact kepler-90g.01 is such a low amplitude transit is responsible for the transit centroid s delocalization , i.e. the data are not good enough to pin down the location . to test this",
    ", we created a fake q6 time series by taking the pixel - level light curves of kepler-90 g s transit , reducing the depth to equal that of kepler-90g.01 , and injecting it in place of the original kepler-90g.01 transit for each pixel .",
    "since the durations of the events are similar ( @xmath39hours for g and @xmath40hours for g.01 ) , this process should produce a realistic estimate of the transit centroid pattern produced if kepler-90g.01 were a genuine exomoon .",
    "recalculating the transit centroids ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : centroids_q6f ] ) , we find that of the fake moon to be highly localized , as visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : mooncentroid_q6f ] , and the transit centroid is now within 1@xmath6 of both kepler-90 g and the total flux .",
    "this test indicates that the delocalized structure seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : mooncentroid_q6 ] is strong evidence that the kepler-90g.01 transit is spurious .    on this basis",
    ", we identify kepler-90g.01 as a false positive exomoon .",
    "the underlying origin for the anomalous transit centroid is unclear , but may be due to a cosmic ray hit causing sudden pixel sensitivity dropout ( spsd ) at this time ( see @xcite ) . as a further check",
    ", we tried detrending the q6 photometry using the trend filtering algorithm ( tfa ) described in @xcite , which searches for common mode behaviors on the same ccd module .",
    "we find that the moon - like transit persists in the tfa light curve , indicating that the other stars on this module do not exhibit the event .",
    "for the purposes of this short letter it is unimportant what the actual origin is ; the key conclusion is that the signal is unlikely to be that of an exomoon .",
    "in this work , we have demonstrated that the exomoon - like transit signal identified near one of the transits of the 8@xmath14 exoplanet kepler-90 g by @xcite is likely a false positive .",
    "this determination is far from obvious , having required us to introduce a new tool to examine _ kepler _   pixel - level data .",
    "@xcite originally suggested the signal may be spurious based on the large temporal separation between the transit of kepler-90 g and the moon - like transit .",
    "however , in this work , we find that the separation corresponds to a moon within the hill sphere , provided kepler-90 g has a mean density exceeding 0.39g@xmath19 .",
    "further , a retrograde exomoon would be stable up to nearly the edge of the hill sphere , following @xcite . based on dynamical stability simulations , the seven - planet system in which kepler-90 g resides is stable",
    "provided g has a density below 0.93g@xmath19 .",
    "finally , we find that the fact that only one of the six observed transits of kepler-90 g shows a high signal - to - noise exomoon transit is easily explained with a photodyanmical model . based on a purely photometric analysis then",
    ", one would conclude that this is a plausible exomoon candidate .",
    "analysis of the prf centroids shows no significant deviations during the times of kepler-90 g s transit , nor that of the moon - like signal . inspecting the pixel - level data however , we suspected that the moon - like transits were occurring on nearly all pixels rather than being centered on the flux centroid . to test this",
    ", we considered a new test , dubbed the `` transit centroid '' , which computes a centroid position weighted by the signal - to - noise of the transit , as seen by each pixel .",
    "this test confirms that the moon - like transit is not localized at the expected position , a result which we demonstrate is not due to the low amplitude nature of the moon - like signal either .",
    "we conclude that the moon - like transit is likely an instrumental artifact , perhaps due to a cosmic ray causing a sudden pixel sensitivity dropout @xcite .",
    "this work establishes that the moon - like signal near kepler-90 g is likely spurious and does not consititute compelling evidence for a transiting exomoon .",
    "the fact that the candidate passes all of the conventional tests , such as photodynamical modeling , imposing dynamical stability and centroid analysis , highlights the extreme difficulty facing exomoon hunters , due to the non - periodic and low - amplitude nature of the signals being sought .",
    "nevertheless , the sensitivity to sub - earth mass exomoons using _ kepler _  is firmly established and despite the mine - field of false positives , a confirmed detection is surely inevitable .",
