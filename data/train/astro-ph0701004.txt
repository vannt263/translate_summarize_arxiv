    "compact neutron star binaries are among the most promising sources of gravitational waves . at low frequencies ,",
    "the continuous inspiral signal may be detectable by the space antenna lisa , while ground based interferometers such as virgo @xcite , ligo @xcite , geo @xcite or tama @xcite , are expected to detect the last few minutes prior coalescence , at frequencies up to 1.4 - 1.6 khz .    in a first paper @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) ,",
    "we have investigated the high frequency signal and its detection with the first generations of ground based detectors . using new estimates of the mean merging rate in the local universe , that account for the galactic star formation history derived directly from observations and",
    "include the contribution of elliptical galaxies , we predict a detection every 148 and 125 years in the volume probed by initial virgo and ligo , and up to 6 detections per year in their advanced configuration .    in a second paper @xcite ( hereafter paper ii ) , we used numerical simulations to estimate the gravitational wave emission produced by the superposition of unresolved extra - galactic sources .",
    "as in paper i , we were interested in the few sixteen minutes before the last stable orbit is reached , when more than 96% of the gravitational wave energy is released and when the frequency evolves in the range 10 - 1500 hz , covered by ground based interferometers .",
    "we find that above the critical redshift @xmath4 , the sources produce a truly continuous background , with a maximal gravitational density parameter of @xmath5 around 670 hz .",
    "the signal is below the sensitivity of the first generation of ground based detectors but could be detectable by the next generation .",
    "correlating two coincident advanced - ligo detectors or two third generation ego interferometers , we derived a s / n ratio of 0.5 and 10 respectively .    in this article , we extend our previous simulations to investigate the stochastic background from the early low frequency inspiral phase",
    ". estimates of the emission from the various population of compact binaries ( see for instance @xcite for the galactic contribution and @xcite for the extra - galactic contribution ) or from captures by supermassive black holes ( @xcite ) , which represent the main source of confusion noise for lisa , are of crucial interest for the development of data analysis strategies . the paper will be organized as follow . in ii . , we describe the simulations of the dns population , in iii . the contribution of inspiralling dns to the stochastic background is calculated and compared to the lisa instrumental noise and to the wd - wd galactic foreground . finally , in iv .",
    "the main conclusions are summarized .",
    "to generate a population of dnss ( each one characterized by its redshift of formation and coalescence timescale ) we follow the same procedure as in paper ii , to which the reader is referred for a more detailed description .",
    "the redshift of formation is randomly selected from the probability distribution @xcite : @xmath6 constructed by normalizing the differential dns formation rate , @xmath7 the normalization factor in the denominator corresponds to the rate at which massive binaries are formed in the considered redshift interval , e.g. , @xmath8 which numerically gives @xmath9 s@xmath10 in the two cosmic star formation rate adopted in this paper .    the formation rate of massive binaries per redshift interval eq .",

    "= @xmath23 @xcite is assumed .",
    "recent measurements of galaxy luminosity function in the uv ( sdss , galex , combo17 ) and fir wavelengths ( spitzer space telescope ) , after dust corrections and normalization , allowed to refine the previous models of star formation history , up to redshift @xmath24 , with tight constraints at redshifts @xmath25 . in our computations",
    ", we consider the recent parametric fits of the form of @xcite , provided by @xcite , constrained by the super kamiokande limit on the electron antineutrino flux from past core - collapse supernovas .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the final results are not significantly different if we adopt , as in paper ii , the sfr given in @xcite .    throughout this paper , we assume that the parameter @xmath26 does not change significantly with the redshift and can be considered as a constant .",
    "in fact , this term is the product of three other parameters , namely , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the fraction of binaries which remains bounded after the second supernova event , @xmath29 is the fraction of massive binaries formed among all stars and @xmath30 is the mass fraction of neutron star progenitors . from paper",
    "i we take @xmath28 = 0.024 and @xmath29 = 0.136 .",
    "@xcite investigated the effect of the initial mass function ( imf ) assumption on the normalization of the sfr .",
    "they showed that top heavy imfs are preferred to the traditional salpeter imf @xcite and their fits are optimized for imfs of the form : @xmath31 with a turnover below @xmath32 m@xmath13 , and normalized within the mass interval 0.1 - 100 m@xmath13 such as @xmath33 = 1 .    in this paper , we assume @xmath34 ( a modified salpeter ) , but taking @xmath35 ( @xcite ) would not change the final results significantly . to be consistent with the adopted models of the sfr",
    ", we follow @xcite and assume a minimal initial mass of 8 m@xmath13 for ns progenitors , the upper mass being 40 m@xmath13 .",
    "it results finally , @xmath36 m@xmath37 .    the next step consists to estimate the redshift @xmath38 at which the progenitors have already evolved and the system is now constituted by two neutron stars .",
    "this moment fixes also the beginning of the inspiral phase .",
    "if @xmath39 ( @xmath40 yr ) is the mean lifetime of the progenitors ( average weighted by the imf in the interval 8 - 40 m@xmath13 ) then    @xmath41    once the beginning of the inspiral phase is established , the redshift at which the coalescence occurs should now be estimated .",
    "the duration of the inspiral depends on the orbital parameters and the neutron star masses .",
    "the probability for a given dns system to coalesce in a timescale @xmath42 was initially derived by @xcite and confirmed by subsequent simulations @xcite and is given by    @xmath43    simulations indicate a minimum coalescence timescale @xmath44 yr and a considerable number of systems having coalescence timescales higher than the hubble time . the normalized probability in the range @xmath45 yr up to 20 gyr implies @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , the redshift @xmath47 at which the coalescence occurs is derived by solving the equation @xmath48 where @xmath49",
    "compared with the previous study , slight complications arise when calculating the spectral properties of the signal . in paper ii , we were interested in the signal emitted between 10 - 1500 hz , which duration in the source frame is short enough , less than 1000 s , to be considered as a burst located at the redshift of coalescence .",
    "now , as we are looking at inspiral phase in the lisa frequency window ( @xmath50 hz ) , the evolution of the redshift of emission with frequency must be taken into account .",
    "for the same reason , the critical redshift at which the population of dnss constitute a truly continuous background ca nt be determined by simply solving the condition @xmath51 , where d is the duty cycle defined as the ratio of the typical duration of a single burst @xmath52 to the average time interval between successive events ( see paper ii ) .",
    "instead , we remove the brightest sources , lying in the close universe , where the distribution of galaxies is expected to be highly anisotropic , in particular due to the strong concentration of galaxies in the direction of the virgo cluster and the great attractor ( see paper i ) , and where the density is well below the average value derived from the sfr ( @xcite ) . in a second step",
    ", we verify that the resulting background is continuous , by using both jaque bera and lilliefors gaussianity tests with significant level @xmath53 over a set of 100 realizations .    for each realization",
    ", the number of simulated dnss corresponds to the expected number of extragalactic dnss observed today and is derived as , @xmath54 the dnss present at redshift z were formed at @xmath55 , with a coalescence time larger than the cosmic time between @xmath56 and z. thus , @xmath57 where @xmath58 with @xmath59= 20 gyr and @xmath60=max(@xmath45 yr;@xmath61 ) , which gives @xmath62 .    we obtain that after @xmath0 , corresponding to the distance beyond the virgo cluster ( @xmath63 mpc ) , when the relative density fluctuations are @xmath64 ( @xcite ) , the background is continuous in the range @xmath50 hz .",
    "we consider also a more conservative threshold of @xmath65 , corresponding to the distance beyond the great attractor ( @xmath66 mpc ) , when the relative density fluctuations are @xmath67 and when the universe is expected to become homogeneous(@xcite ) .",
    "the gravitational flux in the observer frame produced by a given dns is : @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the redshift of emission , @xmath70 the distance luminosity , @xmath71 the proper distance , which depends on the adopted cosmology , @xmath72 the gravitational spectral energy and @xmath73 the frequency of emission in the source frame .    in the quadripolar approximation and for a binary system with masses @xmath74 and @xmath75 in a circular orbit : @xmath76 where the fact that the gravitational wave frequency is twice the orbital frequency was taken into account .",
    "then @xmath77 taking @xmath78 m@xmath13 , one obtains @xmath79 erg hz@xmath80 .",
    "the redshift of emission is derived by solving the relation @xcite : @xmath81 where @xmath82 ( or numerically @xmath83 yr@xmath10 ) , and where the time spent between redshifts @xmath69 and @xmath38 is given by : @xmath84      the spectral properties of the stochastic background are characterized by the dimensionless parameter @xcite :    @xmath85    where @xmath86 is the wave frequency in the observer frame and @xmath87 the critical mass density needed to close the universe , related to the hubble parameter @xmath88 by ,    @xmath89    @xmath90 is the gravitational wave flux at the observer frequency ( given here in erg @xmath91hz@xmath10s@xmath10 ) @xmath92 , integrated over all sources above the critical redshift @xmath93 , namely @xmath94    in our simulations , the integrated gravitational flux is calculated by summing individual fluences ( eq .",

    "the continuous line corresponds to sources located beyond the critical redshift to have a continuous background , @xmath0 ( or @xmath97 mpc ) , while the dashed line corresponds to the more conservative estimate , with a cutoff at @xmath98 ( or @xmath99 mpc ) .",
    "after a fast increase below @xmath100 hz , @xmath96 increases as @xmath101 to reach @xmath102 at 0.1 hz for @xmath0 ( @xmath103 for @xmath98 ) .",
    "this is one order of magnitude larger than the previous predictions by @xcite .",
    ", corresponding to ns - ns inspirals occurring beyond @xmath104 mpc ( continuous curve ) and @xmath99 mpc ( dashed curve ) .",

    "the contribution from dnss may dominate the lisa instrumental noise between @xmath107 - @xmath108 hz for @xmath0 ( @xmath109 - @xmath110 hz for @xmath98 ) and the galactic wd - wd confusion noise after @xmath111 .",
    "however , the resulting reduction in the sensitivity should be less than a factor 4 and thus should nt affect significantly signal detection .    , corresponding to ns - ns inspirals occurring beyond @xmath104 mpc ( continuous curve ) and @xmath99 mpc ( dashed curve ) , along with the lisa instrumental noise ( black ) and the galactic wd - wd foreground ( light gray ) .",
