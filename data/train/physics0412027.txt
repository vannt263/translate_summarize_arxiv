    "when a beam is stored in a storage ring , the beam is affected by a wake force that is generated by an electromagnetic interaction between the beam and the components of the ring .",
    "the wake force disturbs the distribution of particles in the beam .",
    "various approaches to investigate the particle distribution have been performed .",
    "it was usually assumed that the wake force was averaged over one turn and was distributed uniformly in the ring .",
    "in fact , however , the wake sources may be localized .",
    "therefore , such assumptions of an averaged and uniform wake force may cause different dynamical behaviors of the system from real ones in many cases . to see the effects due to such position - dependent wake forces , hirata  @xcite investigated the particle distribution in a beam , assuming a constant localized wake . hirata @xmath0 @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite then showed that the equilibrium bunch length in electron storage rings could exhibit a cusp - catastrophe behavior .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite found that several multi - periodic states in particle distributions of a beam could also exist for a constant wake .",
    "the aim of the present work is at investigating dynamic behaviors of the longitudinal beam distribution in the presence of the wake that has two components localized at one position of the ring . here , we consider the linear wake as well as the constant one as sources of the localized wakes .",
    "it is also of great interest to see how the longitudinal beam distribution behaves dynamically under the composite constant and linear wakes in a ring .",
    "the dynamical behaviors of the beam distribution will be examined with the damping time , the strength of the wake force , and the synchrotron tune considered .",
    "it will be shown that the dynamic system under two localized wake sources may present quite different dynamic behavior from that with an individual wake source taken into account .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we briefly describe the model which is used in order to investigate the equilibrium logitudinal distribution of the beam particles in a gaussian approximation . in section 3 ,",
    "we study the dynamical states of the distribution of particles in a beam . to check the validity of the results from the present model , we also compare them with those from the multi - particle tracking in section 4 .",
    "finally , section 5 is devoted to discussion and conclusion .",
    "we assume that there are two localized wake sources at one position of the ring . to describe dynamics of the particle distribution in longitudinal phase space ,",
    "we introduce the following normalized longitudinal variables : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the natural bunch length and @xmath4 stands for the natural energy spread . the center of the bunch is located at @xmath5=0 such that @xmath6 corresponds to the rear part of the bunch .",
    "the motion of a particle in a ring can then be modeled as follows : + 1 ) radiation    @xmath7    \\2 ) wake    @xmath8    \\3 ) synchrotron oscillation    @xmath9    where @xmath10 in the above equations , @xmath11 , @xmath12 being the synchrotron damping time divided by the revolution time , @xmath13 the synchrotron tune and @xmath14 a gaussian random variable with zero mean and unit standard deviation .    after one turn in the ring ,",
    "the motion of a particle is described by @xmath15 the wake force is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the longitudinal charge density normalized to unity , and @xmath18 stands for the longitudinal wake function multiplied by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the electron charge and @xmath21 the total charge in a bunch .    in the present work ,",
    "we consider the constant as well as the linear wake functions : @xmath22 ( @xmath23 being the unit step function ) and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote the strengths of the wake .",
    "we assume the wake to disappear at a short distance behind the particles producing it so that one can neglect multi - turn effects of the wake . generally , leading particles in a bunch lose energy due to wake fields . in order to meet this condition",
    ", we note that the signs of @xmath25 and @xmath26 in the wake functions should be positive .    since it is not realistic to observe individual particles , we are more interested in statistical quantities such as @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 are either @xmath30 or @xmath31 , which are the moments of the phase - space distribution @xmath32 . in reality , we require all of higher order moments to reproduce @xmath32 .",
    "we always approximate @xmath32 as @xmath33.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for simplicity , however , we assume here that the distribution function in phase space always remains gaussian even under the influence of the wake force .",
    "we thus need to consider only the first- and second - order moments .    with the same treatment as in ref .",
    "@xcite used , each mapping in eqs .",
    "( 1)-(3 ) can be given as : + 1 ) radiation @xmath34 2 ) wake @xmath35 further calculations lead us to obtain for the constant wake  @xcite @xmath36    as for the linear wake , we derived the following relations from eqs . ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) @xmath37 3 ) synchrotron oscillation @xmath38 note that the mappings for @xmath39 and @xmath40 are related to each other for the constant wake function .",
    "however , those for @xmath39 depend on @xmath41 for the linear wake function due to the fact that we have utilized the approximation of the gaussian distribution .",
    "if @xmath42 is the mapping described by eq .  ( 14 ) or eq .  ( 16 ) , then a period - one fixed point @xmath43 is defined by @xmath44 while the period - two fixed point is defined by @xmath45\\ ] ] with @xmath46 and @xmath47 occurring in alternating pairs at successive turns as @xmath48 one can easily extend the definition to period - n states .",
    "first , let us consider the dynamical behavior of the system for the constant wake function .",
    "in a previous work  @xcite , one of the authors studied the dynamic states in the parameter space set : @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 . the results are summarized in table  i , which shows four different behaviors , depending on the synchrotron tune . those numbers in table  i denote existing period states , i.e. 1 stands for the period - one state , 2 does the period - two state , and 1 - 2 denotes the period - one and period - two states existing simultaneously .",
    "the parameter space shows that several types of equilibrium states such as period - one , period - two , period - three , period - four can exist stably depending on the parameter space ( @xmath12 and @xmath25 ) .    in the case of the linear wake function",
    ", it is shown that the period - one state only exists as an equilibrium state .",
    "the tracking of the mapping for the period - one state is drawn in fig .  1 , where the features of the trajectories are indicated near the period - one fixed point .",
    "in the left panel of fig .  1 the fixed point is depicted at @xmath52 ( @xmath53 , @xmath53 ) , whereas in the right panel the fixed point is drawn at @xmath54 ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) .    when it comes to the composite wake of the constant and linear ones @xmath57 , fig .",
