    "the two - dimensional time - dependent ginzburg - landau equation ( tgle ) describing the behavior of the film is written , in dimensionless variables as : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the complex , dimensionless superconducting order parameter normalized with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "we consider the static case where the external fields are absent , thus the electro - magnetic potentials can be absorbed into the order parameter .",
    "we include a small sixth order term in the gl free energy to ensure a numerical stability .",
    "the coefficient @xmath56 is a functional of the order parameter and includes the effects of long - range elastic potentials , temperature @xmath57 , and disorder : @xmath58+\\int d\\mathbf{r }       ^{\\prime } u(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime } ) |\\psi ( \\mathbf{r}^{\\prime } , t)|^{2}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath59 describes quenched fluctuations ( @xmath60 $ ] ) of @xmath0 and @xmath61 is the non - local kernel generated by elasticity interactions .",
    "the temperature @xmath57 is measured in units of superconducting transition temperature @xmath0 , and the unit of the length is the superconducting , zero temperature coherence length @xmath62 .",
    "to couple elasticity and superconductivity we utilize the pressure dependence of @xmath63 which is taken in a linearized form as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the change in the internal pressure induced by elastic forces .",
    "the latter is derived from the condition of the continuity of the deformation fields @xmath66 and the stress balance at the film - substrate interface ( the @xmath67 plane ) , @xmath68and @xmath69 and at the film - vacuum ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 is the thickness of the film ) interface : @xmath72 the superscripts @xmath73 and @xmath74 refer to the film and to the substrate respectively .",
    "these nine coupled equations are solved using a plain - wave ansatz , yielding the exact expressions for the deformation fields which , in their turn , are used for calculating the internal pressure of the film .",

    "both materials are described by the three dimensional displacement fields @xmath98/@xmath99 .",

    "this lattice mismatch leads to a compression of the film - lattice at the interface , such that the lattice spacings match there .",
    "we note , that this description not only applies to crystalline structures but also for amorphous materials , where the  lattice  constants are averaged quantities .",
    "the coefficients @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the shear modulus and the modified poisson number of the film [ @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the poisson number ] . in the following we use the fact , that all interface equations are independent of the @xmath117 and @xmath118 coordinate and set @xmath119 .",

    "the two special solutions for @xmath124 in x- and y - direction , @xmath125 , already used in the ansatz for the deformation fields of the film are obtained through solution of the extended stress - strain balance @xmath126 which takes into account that the systems energy is the sum of the superconducting energy and the mechanical deformation energy .",

    "the tgle without long - range potential has only two stable solutions : a homogeneous one and a striped phase .",
    "even if a long - range potential is present , the stability of these two solutions is only destroyed under certain conditions which can be found out by linear stability analysis ( see next section ) .",
    "e.g. , a coulomb potential or even screened coulomb potential can not create this kind of instability .",
    "however , the elastic potential does , if the model parameters are chosen appropriately .",
    "another possible non - local potential which destroys the homogeneous / striped solutions is a box - potential  @xcite @xmath153 .           in order to determine whether the elastic long - range interactions lead to an instability of the homogeneous solution @xmath18 of the gl equation",

    "<S> the pattern formation and , in particular , the spontaneous emergence of electronic nanometer - scale structures , due to the existence of competing states is ubiquitous in nature and is found in a wealth of complex systems and physical phenomena ranging from magnetism , superconductivity and superfluidity to liquid crystals and biological dynamics@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ginzburg - landau equation , one of the most universal models in theoretical physics , offers an adequate quantitative description of the pattern formation . </S>",
    "<S> here we have revealed the instability and emergence of an electronic textures , due to coupling of the superconducting order parameter with elastic stress fields , generating a non - local term in the ginzburg - landau functional . </S>",
    "<S> it is noteworthy that the general form of the nonlocality in the ginzburg - landau equation , induced by the interplay between the local nonlinearity and the nonlocal couplings , is universal and can result from various physical mechanisms . in particular , while the results presented here are stable with respect to weak disorder , we expect that the interplay of strong disorder with coulomb interactions will give an essential contribution to the nonlocal coupling in the ginzburg - landau functional . </S>",
    "<S> note , in this connection the interesting discussion of the effects of disorder leading to a spatially inhomogeneous distribution of the order parameter@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we thus conclude that a consistent consideration of the superconductivity in thin films has to include the effects of the interplay between strong disorder with coulomb interactions and elasticity .    </S>",
    "<S> the observed island texture is an array of granules of a  good \" superconductor immersed into a sea of a  bad \" one with much smaller amplitude of the order parameter and is equivalent to an array of small superconducting droplets connected via weak links , i.e. , a josephson junction array ( jja ) . in our simulations , where thermal and quantum fluctuations are absent , the josephson coupling </S>",
    "<S> , however weak , eventually establishes a global phase coherence and thus global superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuations , dissipation , and disorder can break down this phase uniformity : the intermediate stages of phase distributions of our simulations represent the final states of the``real world '' systems . </S>",
    "<S> thus the possible eventual configuration of the order parameter phase ( see the `` gaudi - mosaic '' phase distribution in the inset of the last phase - frame of the fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) can correspond even the insulating state . </S>",
    "<S> this is in accord with the general result that jjas turn insulators if the josephson coupling between the superconducting islands becomes sufficiently weak@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus our finding that the transition into a superconducting state in two dimensional superconductors elastically tied to a substrate can occur via the formation of nanoscale superconducting island pattern offers a possible scenario for the superconductor - to - insulator transition observed in various thin superconducting films@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this supports the conjecture@xcite that the formation of a regular array of superconducting droplets is an inherent property of the critical region of the superconductor - to - insulator transition .    </S>",
