    "<S> magnetometry and magnetic imaging with nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) defects in diamond rely on the optical detection of electron spin resonance ( esr ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , this technique is inherently limited to magnetic fields that are weak enough to avoid electron spin mixing . </S>",
    "<S> here we focus on the high off - axis magnetic field regime for which spin mixing alters the nv defect spin dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we first study in a quantitative manner the dependence of the nv defect optical properties on the magnetic field vector * b*. magnetic - field - dependent time - resolved photoluminescence ( pl ) measurements are compared to a seven - level model of the nv defect that accounts for field - induced spin mixing . </S>",
    "<S> the model reproduces the decreases in ( i ) esr contrast , ( ii ) pl intensity and ( iii ) excited level lifetime with an increasing off - axis magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we next demonstrate that those effects can be used to perform all - optical imaging of the magnetic field component @xmath0 orthogonal to the nv defect axis . using a scanning nv defect microscope , </S>",
    "<S> we map the stray field of a magnetic hard disk through both pl and fluorescence lifetime imaging . </S>",
