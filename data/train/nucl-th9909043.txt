    "two - pion interferometry has been regarded as an important means of obtaining the space - time structure of dynamics involved in relativistic heavy - ion collisions . over the years",
    ", extensive studies of two - pion interferometry have been carried out theoretically and experimentally to investigate how much information the correlations of two emitted pions can provide .",
    "as experiments become refined , measurements of three - pion correlations should become feasible , hopefully providing new information .",
    "the first result of such measurements has been recently reported from the cern na44 experiment@xcite .    in the last few years",
    ", some theoretical investigations have been made regarding three - pion interferometry@xcite .",
    "though the treatments of three - pion interferometry and the issues involved are similar to those regarding two - pion interferometry , three - pion interferometry is technically far more complicated than the two - pion case due to the involvement of an additional momentum and also to new aspects of the particle correlations .",
    "consequently , theoretical work so far has been on limited aspects of the interferometry , focusing on a few kinematic variables , such as the sum of three relative invariant momenta , over small ranges of their values .    in the coming years ,",
    "especially when rhic becomes in operation , we expect that experiments on three - pion interferometry will become more detailed and will be made over larger ranges of various kinematic variables .",
    "we report here an investigation of three - pion interferometry over a wide range of kinematic variables .",
    "our major objective is to clarify how much new information we can extract from three - pion interferometry , regarding the space - time structure of the pion source created in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "this work is similar to that of heinz and zhang@xcite in its objective , but it differs in scope .",
    "we numerically calculate the two- and three - pion correlations for the same source functions and compare the two types of correlations .",
    "the calculations are carried out with various model source functions that are based on the bjorken hydrodynamical model . throughout this work ,",
    "we assume pion emission from the source to be completely chaotic . we also neglect possible final - state interactions ( including the coulomb interactions ) between the emitted pions and the source .",
    "the new aspect of the correlations that three - pion interferometry can provide is the phase of the source function s fourier transform .",
    "the information content of the phase differs from that of the magnitude of the fourier transform .",
    "since two - pion interferometry can provide only the magnitude , we hope that three - pion interferometry can provide new information . to this end",
    ", we carefully identify the variables that are sensitive to the phase and suitable for observation .",
    "since the phase is expected to be greatly affected by asymmetry of the source function , we also examine that issue .    in sec .",
    "ii , we summarize the formulation of both the two- and the three - pion interferometries , mainly to define the correlation functions used . in sec .",
    "iii , we describe the various source functions that are used in the calculation , based on the bjorken hydrodynamical model .",
    "the choice of optimal variables in the three - pion correlations is given in sec .",
    "iv , and various numerical results are described in sec .",
    "v. discussion and conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "the two- and three - particle correlation functions that we discuss are reasonably well - known , but for clarity we sketch the formalism of , in our case , bosons , and we define the correlation functions and various variables that appear in this work .",
    "the field operator @xmath0 of emitted bosons , such as pions and kaons , obeys the klein - gordon equation , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the mass of the particle , and @xmath3 the source current@xcite .",
    "the incoming and outgoing states of @xmath0 are specified in terms of the creation and annihilation operators @xmath4 and @xmath5 for these states .",
    "they are related to @xmath3 as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is on - shell and @xmath8 .",
    "we define an important quantity in this work , a source function , @xmath9 , in terms of @xmath3 : @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the quantum ensemble average over various incoming states .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath9 is defined as@xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the amplitude and @xmath14 the phase . for a real @xmath9",
    ", we have @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and thus @xmath17 .",
    "boson spectra and correlation functions will be expressed in terms of @xmath18 or @xmath9 , and @xmath14 is written in the small - momentum expansion as@xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 , and @xmath21 . since @xmath14 is written in terms of odd moments of @xmath22 , an asymmetric ( about @xmath22 ) source causes a strong , nonlinear dependence of @xmath14 on @xmath23 . in this work ,",
    "we examine the @xmath9 of simple forms as discussed in sec .",
    "the one - particle spectrum is given by @xmath24 higher - order correlations of @xmath3 are assumed to satisfy gaussian reduction , such as @xmath25 the two - particle spectrum is then written as @xmath26 where for the pair of the @xmath27-th and @xmath28-th momenta , we define their average and relative momenta as @xmath29 respectively . the two - particle correlation function",
    "is then expressed as @xmath30 hereafter , we denote @xmath31 for @xmath32 and @xmath33 for @xmath34 . equation ( [ eq : c2 ] )",
    "shows that the two - particle correlation function is independent of @xmath33 .",
    "similarly , the three - particle spectrum and correlation are given by @xmath35 and @xmath36 where @xmath37 from the preceding discussion of @xmath33 , we have @xmath38 for a real source function . when @xmath39 , eq .",
    "( 6 ) yields @xmath40 \\ ; \\label{mexphi}\\ ] ] @xmath41 is thus expected to vary prominently when the source is asymmetric ( in @xmath22 ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : c3 ] ) shows that the three - particle correlation function depends on @xmath42 , which is absent in the two - particle correlation .",
    "the rest of the three - particle correlation is expressed in terms of @xmath31 s and can thus be determined from the two - particle correlations .    the three - particle correlation is a function of three momenta , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 . for convenience ,",
    "we introduce the average total momentum , @xmath45 since @xmath46 s satisfy the identity , @xmath47 we have three independent momentum variables , which we will take to be @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .    among various choices of three variables ,",
    "another convenient choice is a set of @xmath51 s . for completeness ,",
    "we show the relations between the first set and @xmath51 s : @xmath52 satisfying @xmath53",
    "we apply the bjorken hydrodynamical model to describe the evolution of the hot region created in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "based on the cooper - frye spectrum , one writes the source function as@xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 denote the coordinate variables defined as @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , respectively ; @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the momentum variables defined as @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "note that we specify the momentum variables for a momentum pair , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , by the subscript @xmath66 , such as @xmath67 , and those for three momenta with no subscript such as @xmath60 .",
    "we set the @xmath68-axis to be the beam direction , and the @xmath22-axis parallel to @xmath69 , or perpendicular to the beam axis .",
    "@xmath70 is a four - velocity of flow , and is @xmath71 in the bjorken hydrodynamical model .",
    "the profile function @xmath72 determines the source shape in the @xmath55-@xmath56 space .",
    "the shape along the transverse direction is taken to be of a gaussian form .",
    "@xmath73 is the freeze - out temperature , and @xmath74 is the measure of freeze - out hypersurface .",
    "we assume that freeze - out occurs on the hypersurface where @xmath55 is constant .    in this work , we examine the following five forms of the profile function .",
    "+ simple ( box - type ) profile : @xmath75 gaussian profile : @xmath76 heinz profile : @xmath77 exponential profile : @xmath78 theta profile : @xmath79",
    "the three - particle correlation function depends on three momenta , which have nine components . as noted in sec .",
    "ii , we choose the three momenta to be @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the dependence of the correlation functions on relative momenta of the emitted bosons by fixing the value of @xmath80 .",
    "this leaves the two relative momenta to be the remaining variables .    in order to identify new information in the correlation function",
    ", we should choose the variables that could provide the most rapid variation of @xmath42 .",
    "figure [ fig-3d ] illustrates the variation of @xmath42 as a function of @xmath83 and @xmath84 with all other components of the relative momenta set to be zero . here",
    ", we use the heinz profile with the parameters of @xmath85 fm , @xmath86 fm , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 mev .",
    "figure [ fig-3d ] shows that @xmath42 is unity along the @xmath83- and @xmath84-axes and also along the line of @xmath89 , or the @xmath90-axis ( because of eq .",
    "figure [ fig-3d ] also shows that @xmath42 varies most prominently along the lines of @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 . because of symmetry , however , it is sufficient to examine the variation around one of the lines , such as the line of @xmath91 .",
    "the reason why the line of @xmath91 provides a prominent variation of @xmath42 is seen as follows .",
    "when @xmath94 and @xmath95 , we have @xmath96 where the ( weak ) dependence on @xmath97 in @xmath98 is not explicitly shown . setting @xmath99 and @xmath100",
    ", we find @xmath101 where @xmath102 .",
    "when @xmath103 and @xmath104 , @xmath105 vanishes at @xmath106 , or @xmath107 , yielding the minimum .",
    "it follows then that the optimum choice is @xmath108 .    with this constraint , the variables are now reduced to a single relative momentum .",
    "the source functions under consideration ( as listed in sec .",
    "iii ) are almost symmetric about the beam and transverse axes , but they can be asymmetric about the time - axis .",
    "which component of @xmath109 should we choose so as to describe most effectively the asymmetric property of the source functions ?",
    "@xmath110 is an obvious choice , but we find that @xmath111 or @xmath112 is the most convenient variable . from eq .",
    "( 10 ) , we have @xmath113 , which gives @xmath114 .",
    "thus @xmath42 as a function of @xmath111 or @xmath112 reflects time - axis asymmetry .",
    "furthermore , for finite @xmath115 , our source functions are not simply a function of @xmath116 without symmetry along the longitudinal direction .",
    "because of this , @xmath112 may be the variable more suitable for identifying the time - axis asymmetry of the source function . in the following",
    ", we will examine both @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "@xmath112 is parallel to @xmath117 , while @xmath118 is perpendicular to it .",
    "following the practice in the literature on two - pion interferometry , we will also denote @xmath112 and @xmath118 as @xmath119 and @xmath120 , respectively .",
    "note that when the dependence of @xmath42 on @xmath111 or @xmath112 is examined , the other components of @xmath81 are fixed in our calculation .",
    "figures [ fig - h2zy ] , [ fig - s2zy ] , [ fig - g2zy ] , [ fig - t2zy ] , and [ fig - e2zy ] illustrate the dependence of @xmath121 and @xmath122 on @xmath83 in the heinz , simple , gaussian , theta , and exponential profile functions , respectively . each figure is shown for @xmath123 , and 2 . in the figures , we set @xmath124 , @xmath125 140 mev , @xmath126 140 mev , @xmath87 , and @xmath127 fm for all profile functions , and also @xmath128 fm for the heinz , theta , and exponential profile functions .",
    "these parameter values reasonably satisfy the recent cern - sps experiment on pb + pb at 158 gev / a@xcite .",
    "note that @xmath129 describes the two - particle correlation since @xmath121 is normalized to be unity at @xmath130 , and that @xmath98 is not observed in the experiment .",
    "figures [ fig - h3zy ] , [ fig - s3zy ] , [ fig - g3zy ] , [ fig - t3zy ] , and [ fig - e3zy ] show @xmath42 and ( half of ) its coefficient in the three - particle correlation function , @xmath131 , as functions of @xmath132 ( @xmath133 ) . each figure is shown for @xmath134 and 2 and @xmath135 140 mev with the parameter values of @xmath73 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and @xmath138 as in figs .",
    "[ fig - h2zy ] , [ fig - s2zy ] , [ fig - g2zy ] , [ fig - t2zy ] , and [ fig - e2zy ] .    in figs .",
    "[ fig - h3zy ] , [ fig - s3zy ] , [ fig - g3zy ] , [ fig - t3zy ] , and [ fig - e3zy ] , we see that for all profile functions , @xmath139 at @xmath140 , and @xmath42 becomes more prominent as @xmath61 increases .",
    "@xmath42 tends to be smaller for the asymmetric profile functions ( such as the simple and exponential profile functions ) than for the symmetric ones , though the difference between them is not substantial .",
    "@xmath41 tends to deviate from zero more slowly than the phases of @xmath141 s , @xmath33 s .",
    "for example , we see in figs . 4 and 5 that when @xmath122 reaches @xmath142 around @xmath143 150 mev , we still have @xmath144 .",
    "the reason for this is general because @xmath41 is defined as @xmath145 and is constrained by the identity , @xmath146 .",
    "in fact , the small - momentum expansion of eq .",
    "( [ exphi ] ) applied to @xmath41 yields that the term linear in @xmath23 vanishes , as discussed in sec .",
    "ii . furthermore",
    ", when @xmath41 starts to deviate from zero , its coefficient in the three - particle correlation function , @xmath147 , tends to become small .",
    "in fact , we see in the figures that @xmath147 gets halved for all profile functions before @xmath42 decreases to 0.9 , and even nearly vanishes when @xmath42 decreases further .",
    "we expect that in actual experiments it will be difficult to identify @xmath42 with a value much smaller than unity .",
    "this is the major finding of this work .",
    "we find the same difficulty when we choose @xmath148 as the independent variable .",
    "figure [ fig - h2tm ] shows @xmath121 and @xmath122 as functions of @xmath149 for the heinz profile for @xmath150 140 , 200 , and 300 mev , with @xmath85 fm , @xmath151 , @xmath87 , @xmath152 fm , and @xmath153 fm .",
    "figure [ fig - h3tm ] also shows @xmath42 and @xmath131 as functions of @xmath154 for the three values of @xmath60 with @xmath155 1.5 and the same values of @xmath73 , @xmath136 , @xmath156 , @xmath137 , and @xmath157 .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "[ fig - h3tm ] that when @xmath42 starts to deviate from unity , its coefficient , @xmath158 , becomes small quite rapidly , as in the previous cases of @xmath111 being the independent variable .",
    "note that @xmath131 decreases more quickly as a function of @xmath148 than of @xmath132 , as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig - h3tm ] and [ fig - h3zy ] .",
    "the quick reduction occurs because of the factor @xmath159 , when the transverse momentum , @xmath148 , is used as the variable .",
    "@xmath160 fm is chosen to reproduce experimental results , but we find that even if a much smaller value of @xmath157 is used , @xmath131 becomes quite small when @xmath42 is off unity .",
    "the difficulty also remains at different values of @xmath137 .",
    "figures [ fig - h2zdt ] and [ fig - h3zdt ] show @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath42 , and @xmath131 as functions of @xmath83 for @xmath161 ( 6.5 , 0.65 ) , ( 4,8 , 2.8 ) , and ( 3.2 , 3.2 ) fm , with @xmath162 mev , @xmath163 mev , @xmath164 , and @xmath87 .",
    "these parameter sets yield the recently measured value of the longitudinal size , @xmath165 3.5 fm@xcite . figure [ fig - h3zdt ] shows that @xmath42 depends on @xmath137 rather strongly .",
    "but the variation of @xmath42 takes place where @xmath131 is small , and will be difficult to observe .",
    "we have investigated the three - particle correlation function for chaotic source , using various profile functions of the source in the bjorken hydrodynamical model . in all profile functions",
    "we have examined , the coefficient of @xmath42 in the three - particle correlation function , @xmath158 , decreases quite rapidly , as @xmath42 decreases from unity .",
    "extraction of @xmath42 is thus difficult when @xmath42 decreases from unity .",
    "this result is in agreement with heinz and zhang@xcite , who previously made a similar investigation for small relative momenta .    in order to clarify why @xmath42 is difficult to observe , we first identify the portion of the source function @xmath166 that most strongly influences the phase , @xmath98 .",
    "@xmath98 appears in the fourier transform of @xmath166 as @xmath167 . as noted previously",
    ", @xmath98 is an odd function of @xmath23 , and @xmath168 for a real source function .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath169 , @xmath170 , thus represents the behavior of @xmath98 relevant to the present discussion and is an odd function of @xmath23 .",
    "the portion of @xmath166 that most strongly affects @xmath98 is thus its odd - function part , @xmath171 , in @xmath172 with @xmath173 and @xmath174 .    consider that @xmath175 and @xmath171 vary over distances of typical scale , @xmath176 and @xmath177 , respectively .",
    "here , @xmath176 and @xmath177 correspond to the spread widths of @xmath175 and the distance to maximum of @xmath171 , respectively , as fig .",
    "[ fig - ex ] illustrates .",
    "@xmath178 and @xmath170 also vary over the scales of @xmath179 and @xmath180 , respectively",
    ". as @xmath98 increases , @xmath170 increases .",
    "the region where @xmath170 is appreciable is @xmath181 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath182 becomes small in the region where @xmath23 is larger than @xmath179 .",
    "thus , if @xmath183 , the variation of @xmath98 is not difficult to observe .",
    "this is , however , untenable as long as @xmath166 is positive everywhere .",
    "consider @xmath184 in some region : we then have @xmath185 in that region , and furthermore , @xmath186 .",
    "the last inequality contradicts the desired inequality .    in this discussion",
    ", we have assumed the source function , @xmath9 , to be positive everywhere , as done in common practice .",
    "how realistic is this assumption ?",
    "if @xmath9 is a statistical phase - space distribution , @xmath9 should not be negative everywhere . generally speaking",
    ", however , @xmath9 can be locally negative , provided its integrals over @xmath22 or @xmath80 be positive .",
    "this property is similar to , for example , that of the wigner function .",
    "furthermore , @xmath9 that is locally negative suggests that it would be associated with some dynamics involving quantum correlation .",
    "this aspect of the interferometry is currently under investigation .",
    "measurement of the three - pion correlations from the cern na44 experiment has been recently reported@xcite for the total relative momentum of up to about 300 mev , and the extraction of @xmath42 up to about 60 mev .",
    "this total relative momentum is too small to observe the variation of @xmath42 that is examined in this work . taken as a constant , @xmath42 is found to be about 0.2@xcite and is much smaller than the value of unity for a chaotic source , as discussed in this work .",
    "the reason for the small value is unknown , but it may be because of partial coherence of the source , or even because of a more exotic reason@xcite .    in summary ,",
    "we have investigated three - particle interferometry from chaotic sources using the bjorken hydrodynamical model .",
    "the optimal variables are identified suitable for extracting new information through the phase of the source function s fourier transform .",
    "the three - particle correlations are calculated over a wide range of the kinematic variables .",
    "a variation of the three - pion phase is found to be difficult to observe experimentally because its coefficient , as it appears in the three - particle correlation function , becomes small in that region .",
    "this is the case if the source function is positive everywhere as conventionally assumed , and suggests the interesting possibility of the source function being locally negative .",
