    "phase coherence in solid state conductors is a property of fundamental interest .",
    "the prospect of solid state quantum information has also put the focus on possible applications based on phase coherence . with the progress of mesoscopic physics it has become possible to experimentally explore the properties of quantum phase coherence in solid state conductors in a controllable way.@xcite as a prominent example , the fermionic ( electronic ) analog of the well known bosonic ( optical ) mach - zehnder interferometer(mzi ) was recently realized by ji _ et al _ @xcite and further investigated in refs .",
    "the absence of closed electron orbits makes the mzi the most elementary interferometer and therefore of particular interest .",
    "the mzi experiments@xcite were all implemented in a conductor in the integer quantum hall regime , where the electrons propagate along unidirectional , quantum mechanical edge states and quantum point contacts ( qpcs ) act as beam splitters . in the experiments@xcite the visibility of the conductance oscillations as a function of flux @xmath0 were reduced below the ideal value , a signature of dephasing of the electrons propagating along the edges .",
    "dephasing in the mzi was investigated in several theoretical works .",
    "originally , seelig and bttiker@xcite investigated the effect of dephasing on the conductance oscillations due to nyquist noise . following the experiment in ref .",
    "[ ] , where also the shot noise was measured , a number of works investigated the effect of dephasing on the current and the noise .",
    "the dephasing was introduced via fluctuating classical potentials@xcite and by coupling the mzi to a quantum bath@xcite as well as to a voltage probe.@xcite recently these studies were extended to the full distribution of the transferred charge , both for a fluctuating classical potential@xcite as well as a voltage probe@xcite as a source of dephasing .",
    "taken together , these theoretical investigations have provided a qualitative picture of the effect of dephasing on transport properties in the mzi .",
    "the experimental situation is however not conclusive . in the very recent work by litvin _",
    "et al _ @xcite the observed temperature and voltage dependence of the visibility of the conductance oscillations are in good agreement with the noninteracting theory of ref .",
    "[ ] . in particular , the effect of the interferometer arm asymmetry is clearly manifested .",
    "the overall visibility is however low , a couple of percent .",
    "in contrast , in the recent work by neder _",
    "et al_@xcite the visibility is high , @xmath3 , but the voltage dependence of the conductance visibility was found to be insensitive to arm asymmetry , however showing a clear lobe structure . a possible explanation for the findings of ref .",
    "[ ] was also suggested , invoking interactions between electrons at different edge states.@xcite the experimental situation thus motivates further investigations of the coherent transport properties of the mzi .    in this work",
    "we propose to investigate the properties of the currents in a pump driven mzi .",
    "in contrast to previous work , both experimental and theoretical , all electronic reservoirs are kept at the same potential .",
    "the current is instead created via the quantum pump effect , @xcite by varying periodically the transparencies of the two qpcs .",
    "working in the adiabatic , low pump frequency limit the system is kept close to equilibrium .",
    "this minimizes the effect of inelastic dephasing and hence allows for a more detailed investigation of the coherence properties .",
    "theoretically , a large number of investigations of various aspects of quantum pumping have been carried out , a representative collection can be found in refs .",
    "[ ] . however , only a few experiments aimed at investigating quantum pumping of electrical currents have been performed.@xcite in the mzi the current is a true quantum interference effect .",
    "in addition , the elementary structure of the mzi and the fact that the potential applied at the qpc control both the pump effect and the scattering properties of the qpcs makes the mzi a promising candidate for a quantum pump .",
    "previous studies of pumping in mesoscopic interferometers have concerned aharonov - bohm,@xcite double slit - quantum dot@xcite and two - particle@xcite interferometers , however , to the best of our knowledge , not mzis .",

    "it is found that the pumped current contains both an aharonov bohm flux dependent part @xmath1 , due to interfering paths enclosing the flux , and a flux independent part @xmath2 .",
    "both current parts depend linearly on the pump frequency in the low frequency , adiabatic regime and show oscillations as a function of frequency in the high frequency , non - adiabatic regime .",
    "the oscillations in the non - adiabatic regime occur on two different frequency scales , governed by the interferometer arm length difference and the mean arm length respectively .",
    "for the flux dependent current @xmath1 , the oscillations have a constant amplitude while the amplitude of the @xmath2 oscillations increases linearly with frequency",
    ". the two current parts also display a different dependence on temperature ; the flux independent part is insensitive to temperature while the flux dependent part is monotonically suppressed with increasing temperature .    in the experiments in refs .",
    "[ ] rectification effects made it difficult to distinguish the pumped current .",
    "importantly , in the mzi it is found that in the regime of low amplitude , adiabatic pumping , rectification effects@xcite are absent for semitransparent beam - splitters . in order to investigate the effect of dephasing on the pumped current , we consider one of the interferometer arms connected to a voltage probe .",
    "electrons injected into the probe scatter inelastically and hence lose phase coherence before being emitted out of the probe again . two limiting regimes of the charge relaxation , or rc , time of the voltage probe compared to the pump period",
    "are considered ; the long relaxation time regime , where the potential of the probe is constant during the measurement , and the short relaxation time regime where the potential of the probe adjusts instantaneously in order to keep zero time dependent current at the probe . in the long time",
    "regime the flux dependent current @xmath1 as well as the part of the flux independent @xmath2 flowing in the arm connected to the probe are successively suppressed by increasing the dephasing , i.e. the strength of the coupling to the probe . in the short time regime , only @xmath1 is suppressed by dephasing .",

    "since the particles entering the probe have scattered at the adiabatically pumped qpc a only , there is no dc - current flow into the probe and the potential of the probe @xmath145 stays at the same potential as the four reservoirs of the mzi .",
    "we thus have an extended pumping problem with five instead of four equipotential reservoirs , which can be treated along the same lines as above .",
    "first , the coupling of the mzi to the probe leads to a modification of the scattering amplitudes in eq .",

    "moreover , there are now the amplitudes to scatter to and from the probe , as e.g. from @xmath148 to @xmath62 @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the length along the left edge between the probe and qpc b ( see fig . [ figdep ] ) .",

    "( [ idc ] ) , we arrive at the result that the coherent current is modified as @xmath152 the flux independent current in the arm to which the probe is coupled , @xmath90 , is successively suppressed for increasing coupling @xmath137 to the probe . for perfect coupling , @xmath138 ,",
    "the current @xmath90 is zero .",
    "the pumped current flowing through the arm not connected to the probe is however unaffected by the coupling to the probe .",
    "in contrast , the entire flux independent current @xmath153 is suppressed for increasing coupling to the probe , down to zero for perfect coupling .      in the limit of a response time",
    "much shorter than the pumping period , @xmath154 , the potential of the probe @xmath140 adjusts instantaneously , in order to keep the time dependent current at the probe zero , @xmath155 .",
    "this corresponds to that all frequency components of the current [ see eq .",
    "( [ floqcomp ] ) ] are zero , @xmath156 since the electrons entering the voltage probe are rapidly thermalized , the electrons in the probe can be considered in the same way as electrons in a reservoir with oscillating potential , i.e. in dynamical equilibrium .",
    "the oscillating potential gives rise to a nonequilibrium distribution of the electrons leaving the probe .",
    "formally , assuming a uniform potential of the probe , we follow the scattering approach in ref . [ ] and introduce annihilation operators for the electrons emitted from the probe as @xmath157 here the operators @xmath158 describe equilibrium electrons : @xmath159 the amplitudes @xmath160 are defined as @xmath161 the annihilation operators for particles injected into the probe can then be written as @xmath162 .",

    "( [ a_phi ] ) effectively describe forward , inelastic scattering from the probe out into the mzi .",
    "we can consequently combine the amplitudes @xmath163 for excitation of the electrons in the probe and the amplitudes @xmath164 for scattering in the mzi with zero probe potential into a new , unitary floquet scattering matrix @xmath165 .",
    "this gives @xmath166 for @xmath167 and @xmath168 and similarly for @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",

    "( [ currlongdep ] ) , the current part @xmath89 is unaffected by the dephasing .",
    "importantly , the different dephasing behaviors in the two regimes of probe relaxation time are clearly manifested in the pumped current . in the long time",
    "regime the suppression of the current in the left arm @xmath90 leads to that the measured current only depends on the time for ballistic propagation in the right arm , see eq .",

    "[ fig3 ] ) is suppressed on increasing dephasing . in the short time regime",
    "there is no such suppression .",
    "we have investigated the pumped currents in a mzi implemented in a conductor in the quantum hall regime . the motivation for our investigation was twofold .",
    "first , a mzi is the most elementary interferometer , due to the absence of closed electronic orbits . in our proposal",
    "the pumped current in the mzi is moreover operated solely by modulating the potential at the two qpcs .",
    "this makes pumping in the mzi both fundamentally important and experimentally achievable .",
    "second , recent experiments @xcite on transport in a voltage biased mzi has demonstrated the relevance of dephasing and raised a number of questions on the coherence properties of mzis . working in the adiabatic pumping regime",
    "makes it possible to investigate these coherence properties close to equilibrium , keeping dephasing at a minimum .",
    "the dependence of the current on pumping frequency , pumping strength , temperature and lengths of the arms of the mzi were investigated .",
    "the two parts of the current , the flux dependent and the flux independent ones , were demonstrated to depend in a qualitatively different way on frequency and temperature .",
    "the two current parts also showed a different sensitivity to dephasing , introduced by coupling a voltage probe to one of the interferometer arms .",
    "the flux dependent current was successively suppressed for increasing coupling , while only the part of the flux independent current flowing in the arm connected to the probe was sensitive to dephasing in the limit of long charge relaxation time of the probe .",
    "we also demonstrated that rectification effects , preventing an unambiguous demonstration of quantum pumping of current , are absent in the mzi when working with semitransparent beam splitters in the adiabatic , weak pumping regime .    in a broader perspective , a better understanding and control of coherence properties of edge state transport is important for a successful realization of two - particle hanbury brown twiss interferometers,@xcite entanglement production @xcite and quantum state transfer @xcite in quantum hall systems . in the context of entanglement ,",
    "an unambiguous demonstration of quantum pumping in the mzi also opens up for schemes for entanglement generation based on quantum pump effects.@xcite",
