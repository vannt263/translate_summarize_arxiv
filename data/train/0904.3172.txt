    "in the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interactions , it is the @xmath13 cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix that provides an elegant and consistent description of the observed phenomena of quark flavor mixing and cp violation @xcite .",
    "unitarity is the only but powerful constraint , imposed by the sm itself , on the ckm matrix @xmath0 .",
    "this constraint can be expressed as two sets of orthogonality - plus - normalization conditions : @xmath14 where the greek subscripts run over the up - type quarks @xmath15 and the latin subscripts run over the down - type quarks @xmath16 .",
    "the six orthogonality relations correspond to six triangles in the complex plane , the so - called unitarity triangles . among them , the triangle @xmath17 is most popular because both its three inner angles ( defined as @xmath3 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 in fig . 1 ) and its three sides can well be determined at the @xmath20-meson factories @xcite .",
    "the counterpart of @xmath17 is the unitarity triangle @xmath21 ( as shown in fig .",
    "1 ) , which will be measured and reconstructed at the lhc-@xmath22 @xcite and ( or ) the super-@xmath20 factory @xcite . note that one of the inner angles of @xmath21 is equal to the inner angle @xmath3 of @xmath17 .",
    "current experimental data @xcite tell us that these two triangles are approximately congruent with each other .",
    "for example , the inner angles @xmath23 and @xmath24 of @xmath21 are very close to @xmath18 and @xmath19 of @xmath17 : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the well - known wolfenstein parameters @xcite in an @xmath28-expansion of the ckm matrix @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "a more striking result is @xmath1 obtained by the ckmfitter group @xcite and the utfit collaboration @xcite .",
    "if @xmath7 holds exactly , then both @xmath17 and @xmath21 will be the right triangles .",
    "the possibility of @xmath1 was actually conjectured a long time ago in an attempt to explore the realistic texture of quark mass matrices @xcite , and it has recently been remarked from some different phenomenological points of view @xcite .",
    "here we are interested in the following questions and possible answers to them :    * what is the immediate consequence of @xmath7 on the ckm matrix @xmath0 and its four independent parameters ? * could @xmath1 result from an underlying but more fundamental cp - violating phase @xmath29 in the quark mass matrices or in the ckm matrix ? * is the result @xmath1 or @xmath8 stable against quantum corrections , for instance , from the electroweak scale @xmath5 to a superhigh - energy scale @xmath6 ( such as the scale of grand unified theories or the scale of neutrino seesaw mechanisms ) ? in other words , is @xmath30 at @xmath5 possibly a natural low - energy consequence of @xmath29 at @xmath6 due to the renormalization - group running effect ?",
    "* could the @xmath13 maki - nakagawa - sakata ( mns ) neutrino mixing matrix @xmath10 @xcite contain a similar maximal cp - violating phase @xmath31 ?",
    "we shall point out that @xmath7 simply implies @xmath32 .",
    "given a very suggestive parametrization of @xmath0 advocated in ref .",
    "@xcite , we show that its cp - violating phase @xmath2 is nearly equal to @xmath3 ; i.e. , @xmath33 .",
    "but we find that both @xmath2 and @xmath3 are rather stable in the renormalizaton - group evolution from @xmath5 up to @xmath6 or vice versa , and thus it is impossible to obtain @xmath30 at @xmath5 from @xmath29 at @xmath6 by attributing the tiny difference @xmath33 to radiative corrections .",
    "we shall briefly discuss the approximate quark - lepton complementarity relations both in the standard parametrizations of @xmath0 and @xmath10 and in our particular parametrizations of @xmath0 and @xmath10 , and then make a conjecture of the maximal cp - violating phase @xmath9 for the mns matrix @xmath10 at the end of this paper .",
    "we hope that some of our points , which might be helpful for building phenomenological models , can soon be tested with more accurate experimental data on quark and lepton flavor mixing parameters .",
    "let us define the jarlskog invariant of cp violation @xmath34 for the ckm matrix @xmath0 @xcite : @xmath35 where the greek and latin subscripts run over @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "all six unitarity triangles of @xmath0 have the same area which amounts to @xmath36 .",

    "1 correspond to the orthogonality relations @xmath37 if @xmath7 holds ( i.e. , both @xmath17 and @xmath21 are right triangles ) , then we have @xmath38 as a straightforward consequence ; namely , the rephasing - invariant quartet @xmath39 is purely imaginary .",
    "hence @xmath30 implies a certain correlation between the parameters of @xmath0 in a specific parametrization .",
    "let us illustrate this point by taking two well - known parametrizations of the ckm matrix @xmath0 .    * in the wolfenstein parametrization of @xmath0 @xcite , we have @xmath40 \\ ; .",

    "given @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 for example @xcite , the cp - violating phase turns out to be @xmath51 .",
    "this result is also consistent with the approximate relation @xmath52 and the present experimental measurement of @xmath19 @xcite .    in both cases , however , we see nothing suggestive behind @xmath30",

    "the merits of this particular parametrization in understanding quark mass generation and studying heavy flavor physics are striking @xcite : ( 1 ) it directly follows the chiral expansion of up- and down - type quark mass matrices , and thus it can naturally accommodate the observed hierarchy of quark masses ; ( 2 ) its three mixing angles are simply but exactly related to the precision measurements of @xmath20-meson physics , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 can well be interpreted in a variety of quark mass models ( see ref .",

    "the result @xmath33 is interesting in the sense that current experimental data might imply @xmath29 at a superhigh energy scale @xmath74 and @xmath7 at the electroweak scale @xmath5 , if radiative corrections happen to compensate for the tiny discrepancy between @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "we shall examine whether this point is true or not in the next section .",
    "is @xmath2 more fundamental than @xmath3 in describing the phenomenon of cp violation in the quark sector ?",
    "the answer to this question should be affirmative if the textures of up- and down - type quark mass matrices ( @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) are parallel and originate from the same underlying dynamics @xcite . in this case",
    ", @xmath0 can be decomposed into a product of two unitary matrices : @xmath79 , where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are responsible respectively for the diagonalizations of @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( i.e. , @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) and take the following forms : @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are defined .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath89 and @xmath90 hold .",
    "hence @xmath2 measures the phase difference between up- and down - type quark mass matrices and is the only source of cp violation in the quark sector .",

    "@xmath33 no matter how we adjust the energy scale ( and the value of @xmath128 in the mssm case ) .",
    "compared with the parametrization of the ckm matrix @xmath0 given in eq .",
    "( 7 ) , a similar parametrization of the mns matrix @xmath10 is also convenient for the description of lepton flavor mixing and cp violation : together with a suggestive relationship @xmath129 @xcite , where @xmath130 and @xmath131 are the neutrino masses corresponding to @xmath132 and @xmath133 flavors .",

    "@xmath137 where @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 ; and @xmath142 is a diagonal phase matrix containing two nontrivial cp - violating phases when three neutrinos are majorana particles . although the form of @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( 19 ) is apparently different from that of the standard parametrization of @xmath10 @xcite , their corresponding flavor mixing angles ( @xmath143 ) and ( @xmath144 ) have quite similar meanings in interpreting the experimental data on solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations . in the limit @xmath145",
    ", one can easily arrive at @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "note that the tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing pattern @xcite , which is well consistent with a global fit of current neutrino oscillation data @xcite , _ does _ coincide with this interesting limit ( i.e. , @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 ) .",
    "therefore , three mixing angles of @xmath10 can simply be related to those of solar , atmospheric and reactor neutrino oscillations in the leading - order approximation @xcite ; i.e. , @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 as a natural consequence of very small @xmath154 .",
    "the above comparison between our parametrization and the standard one indicates that both of them might be suitable for describing the approximate quark - lepton complementarity ( qlc ) relations @xcite .",

    "turning to our parametrizations of the ckm and mns matrices in eqs .",
    "( 7 ) and ( 19 ) , we find that similar qlc relations can approximately hold within @xmath159 error bars : @xmath160 this result seems to be somewhat contrary to the expectation that the qlc relations are convention - dependent and may only hold in a single parametrization for @xmath0 and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "we believe that the _ exact _ qlc relations can only be realized ( or assumed ) in a unique parametrization for @xmath0 and @xmath10 , but the approximate ones are possible to show up in different parametrizations .",
    "the reason for the latter point is quite simple : the smallest elements of the ckm and mns matrices are both at their up - right corner ( i.e. , @xmath161 and @xmath162 ) , and thus the flavor mixing between the first and second families is approximately decoupled from that between the second and third families . in other words , it is the smallness of @xmath163 ( or @xmath97 ) and @xmath164 ( or @xmath154 ) that assures the approximate qlc relations in eqs .",
    "( 20 ) and ( 21 ) to hold simultaneously .",
    "note again that the approximate qlc relations , similar to @xmath165 , are extracted from current experimental data at low energies .",
    "one may wonder whether such empirical relations are stable against radiative corrections , or whether they can be exact at a specific energy scale far above @xmath5 . because quark and lepton flavor mixing angles obey different rges in their evolution from @xmath5 to @xmath6 ( or vice versa ) @xcite , we should have @xmath166 and @xmath167 in general @xcite .",
    "this observation is also true for our parametrizations of the ckm and mns matrices ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the explicit rges of @xmath154 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 and @xmath170 ) , no matter whether neutrinos are dirac particles or majorana particles .",
    "finally , let us conjecture that @xmath31 holds in the lepton sector .",
    "this possibility can actually be realized in some specific neutrino mass models ( e.g. , @xmath31 was first obtained in the so - called ",
    "democratic \" neutrino mixing scenario @xcite ) . while @xmath2 is rather stable against quantum corrections from one energy scale to another , as already shown in eq .",
    "( 18 ) , @xmath170 is in general sensitive to the rge effects @xcite .",
    "does @xmath31 imply that a pair of the leptonic unitarity triangles are right or almost right ?",
    "the answer to this question depends on the value of @xmath154 ( or equivalently @xmath164 in the standard parametrization of @xmath10 ) , which has not been fixed by current neutrino oscillation experiments . for illustration",
    ", we consider the leptonic unitarity triangle @xmath171 defined by the orthogonality relation @xmath172 in the complex plane @xcite . denoting the inner angle",
    "@xmath173 $ ] and taking the maximal cp - violating phase @xmath31 , we find @xmath174 where higher - order terms of @xmath175 have been omitted",

    "( 22 ) with the typical inputs @xmath177 , @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "it is easy to see that the value of @xmath180 approaches @xmath31 when @xmath154 approaches zero , but in the limit of @xmath181 there will be no cp violation ( i.e. , @xmath170 becomes trivial and can be rotated away from @xmath10 by rephasing the electron field ) and all the leptonic unitarity triangles of @xmath10 must collapse into lines .",
    "this example illustrates that @xmath31 implies the existence of two nearly right unitarity triangles ( @xmath171 and its counterpart @xmath182 defined by the orthogonality relation @xmath183 ) in the lepton sector , similar to the case in the quark sector .",
    "in view of the experimental indication that two unitarity triangles of the ckm matrix @xmath0 are almost the right triangles with @xmath165 , we have explored its possible implications on the phenomenology of quark flavor mixing and quark - lepton complementarity .",
