    "a full nonet of molecular - like scalar states is generated in the unitarized chiral perturbation theory of ref .",
    "in particular , pelaez @xcite studied the large-@xmath6 dependence of the light scalar resonances finding that they do not scale as quarkonia but in agreement with a molecular or tetraquark composition ( see , however , also the discussions in refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the present paper we concentrate on an important aspect of light scalar resonances , namely the form of their spectral functions , in a simple theoretical context . in this study ,",
    "relevant for both quarkonium or tetraquark assignment of light scalars @xcite , effects arising from loops of pseudoscalar mesons are considered : this leads to parametrizations of spectral functions beyond the ( usually employed ) breit - wigner and flatt distributions and allow to include finite - width effects in the evaluation of decay rates . in particular ,",
    "we consider the following physical scenarios : ( i ) the case of a broad scalar resonance , strongly coupled to one decay channel , such as the @xmath7 in the pion - pion decay mode , for which the spectral function can deviate substantially form the breit - wigner form ; ( ii ) the case of two channels , one of which is sub - threshold for the mass and thus forbidden at tree - level , as the @xmath8 decay mode for the resonances @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the latter case a comparison with the usually employed flatt distribution is performed .    the key - quantity of the discussion is the propagator of scalar resonances dressed by mesonic loops in one or more channels . when the kllen - lehmann representation is satisfied , as verified at one - loop level in the case of light scalar mesons for large ranges of parameters achasovprop , the spectral function ( proportional to the imaginary part of the propagator ) is correctly normalized and is interpreted as a ` mass distribution ' for the scalar state .",
    "a general definition of the decay of a scalar state , involving the obtained mass distribution , is then possible . in this way one takes into account in a consistent fashion finite - width effects for the decay , hence allowing to study deviations form the usually employed tree - level formula for decay rates .",
    "furthermore , the fulfillment of the kllen - lehmann representation offers a criterion to delimit the validity of our one - loop study : as soon as violations appear ( generally for large coupling constants ) the obtained spectral functions are no longer usable .",
    "we regularize the mesonic loops by means of a cutoff function which in turn is equivalent to a nonlocal interaction lagrangian . in a phenomenological perspective",
    "it is reasonable that the mesonic states in the loop can not have indefinitely high virtual momenta which are naturally limited due to the finite range of the meson - meson interaction .",
    "we also show that the dependence on the chosen cutoff function and on the specific value of the cutoff is mild .    in order to render the paper easily understandable and",

    "flatt distribution must be normalized by hand .",
    "the two distributions are quite similar , only for the @xmath207 the values of the mass corresponding to the maximum of the distributions are slightly different .",
    "this is due to the strong coupling of @xmath207 to kaons and , as already argued by achasov @xcite , the meson loop distributions coincide with the flatt ones only in the limit of weak coupling .    in fig .",

    "the outcoming branching ratio @xmath219 is @xmath220-@xmath221 larger than the pdg average @xmath222 , while the obtained ratio @xmath223 is @xmath224-@xmath225 in qualitative agreement with the ( not bold ) results listed in pdg .",
    "notice furthermore that the @xmath207 mesons turns out to have typically a larger width than @xmath206 meson in agreement with ref .",

    "we finally comment on a possible tetraquark unified interpretation of the light scalar mesons as presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . a too small decay constant @xmath215",
    "would also imply a by far too narrow @xmath226 and @xmath12 mesons ( related by clebsh - gordon coefficients @xcite ) , thus against a tetraquark nonet . on the contrary ,",
    "@xmath215 between @xmath217-@xmath218 gev is in agreement with a tetraquark nonet below @xmath3 gev , although problems , such as a too narrow @xmath12 , persist , see discussions in @xcite .",
    "such a strong coupling in the @xmath205-channel implies that virtual cloud of kaon - antikaon pairs plays an important role , in particular for the @xmath207 resonance .",
    "a heuristic indicator of the mesonic cloud can be given by the quantity @xmath227 where @xmath228 $ ] ( with @xmath229 ) refers to the kaonic loop only . as discussed in section ii in the subthreshold case ( which applies to the kaonic channel here ) the quantity @xmath109 varies between @xmath230 and @xmath3 and measures the mesonic cloud dressing of the original bare resonance @xmath231 in the @xmath207 case , by using eq .",

    "@xcite , where the light scalar mesons posses a tetraquark core but are dressed by kaonic clouds .",
    "in this work we studied the spectral functions of scalar mesons in one- and two - channel cases suitable for the description of light scalar mesons below 1 gev .",
    "we have computed , by using lagrangians with non - derivative couplings , the propagators of scalar mesons at one - loop level .",
    "they satisfy for large ranges of parameters the kllen - lehmann representation , therefore implying normalized spectral functions . in this way a correct definition of decay amplitudes , weighted over the spectral function , is formulated : the finite - width effects are automatically taken into account .",
    "the resulting decay rates are smaller than the tree - level ones with increasing mismatch for increasing interaction strength . on the other hand , a sub - threshold tree - level forbidden decay , such as",
    "the @xmath205 mode for @xmath13 and @xmath235 becomes large .",
    "the resulting spectral functions for the @xmath11 and @xmath12 mesons may deviate consistently from the breit - wigner form .",
    "the flatt distribution , although it approximates to a good level of accuracy the @xmath236 and @xmath9 spectral functions , emerges as a small - coupling limit of our more general spectral function .    as stressed by achasov @xcite it is important to use distributions satisfying kllen - lehmann representations in experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "we thus believe that the use of distributions obtained from quantum field theoretical models fulfilling the correct normalization requirements can be helpful to correctly disentangle the nature of the scalar states .",
