    "in recent years a great deal of progress has been made in solving the nuclear many - body problem based on microscopic nuclear interactions . using a stochastic approach @xcite or directly diagonalizing the hamiltonian @xcite , previous investigations have been able to improve the accuracy of the calculations to a level , so that rather small parts of the hamiltonian , like the three - nucleon ( 3n ) forces , can be probed by a comparison of the predicted spectra to the experimental values . for unambiguous conclusions ,",
    "a reliable error bound for the calculations is of highest importance .",
    "currently , error bounds have often been established using benchmark calculations @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we propose a new scheme to extend no - core shell model ( ncsm ) calculations beyond their current limits , and to estimate error bounds for existing calculations .",
    "we establish a correlation between the expectation value of the hamiltonian @xmath2 with respect to the approximate ground state and that of the square of the hamiltonian @xmath3 , following the ideas of mizusaki and imada @xcite .",
    "this will improve the estimate of binding energies and provide more reliable error estimates .",
    "to this aim , we proceed with a brief introduction to the main concepts of ncsm calculations in section  [ sec : ncsm ] .",
    "then we motivate the correlation by the properties of ncsm effective interactions and perturbation theory in section  [ sec : scaling ] .",
    "a comparison between the extrapolated results and the known binding energies for @xmath0h and @xmath1li is given in section  [ sec : extrap ] .",
    "conclusions and outlooks to the applications of this method and a discussion of the relation of this work to previous ones in refs .",
    "@xcite are presented in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "usually shell - model calculations assume an inert nuclear core . taking only the valence nucleons as active particles clearly has the advantage of reducing the number of many - nucleon states .",
    "but , so far , this also means that effective shell model interactions have to be used , which can not simply be related to nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interactions , as they have been developed for few - nucleon systems .",
    "the ncsm approach is different .",
    "all nucleons are taken to be active , and the same interactions are used as they are in traditional few - body methods .",
    "the calculations are performed in a finite antisymmetrized harmonic oscillator ( ho ) basis , using either jacobi @xcite or cartesian coordinates like those in usual shell model investigations . in general , the short range repulsion of nuclear forces can not be easily described in a finite basis .",
    "in particular , the ho basis is not well suited to describe the short range correlations and , on the other hand , the exponential tail of bound - state wave functions .",
    "consequently , effective interactions appropriate to the basis - size truncation must be derived from the underlying nuclear forces in order to achieve convergence with a manageable number of basis states .",
    "these effective interactions can be systematically related to the `` bare '' nn interactions @xcite .",
    "the scheme described in refs .",
    "@xcite is based on unitary transformations of the hamiltonian @xcite , which decouple the model space from the complete hilbert space describing the quantum mechanical system .",
    "the starting point of all ncsm calculations is a non - relativistic @xmath4-body hamiltonian , which includes two - body interactions .",
    "the extension to 3n forces has been introduced in @xcite .",
    "we do not take them into account in this study .",
    "adding the center - of - mass ( cm ) ho potential , which is subtracted at a later stage in the calculation , one can cast the hamiltonian @xcite into the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is the momentum ( position ) of the particle @xmath8 with mass @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the total mass of the @xmath4 particles .",
    "it is possible to establish a unitary transformation of the hamiltonian , which decouples two parts of the hilbert space  a rather small finite model space @xmath11 and the rest of the hilbert space @xmath12 .",
    "the projection operators on the two spaces are also called @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "they fulfill the relations @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the unitary transformation @xcite .",
    "the solution of the @xmath4-body problem is made possible by the observation that , for nuclear problems , a cluster approximation to the full unitary transformation sufficiently speeds up the convergence compared to the bare interactions , so that practical calculations are possible .",
    "instead of solving the full @xmath4-body problem , the procedure is carried out for a much smaller @xmath16-body problem , with @xmath17 or @xmath18 in practice .",
    "for such cases , one starts with the hamiltonian @xmath19 note that the mass of the full @xmath4-body system enters into the strength constant of the relative ho potential .",
    "therefore , for this @xmath16-body hamiltonian , the ho interaction does not cancel in the relative motion , and provides a confining mean field interaction . however , the ho interaction is cancelled in the @xmath4-body calculation .",
    "this procedure improves the convergence of our @xmath4-body results with increasing model space size .    using the unitary transformation satisfying @xmath20",
    ", one determines an effective hamiltonian @xmath21 , which exactly describes the @xmath16-body cluster in the model space .",
    "the truncation @xmath22 from the full @xmath16-body hilbert space is related to @xmath11 by the requirement that the @xmath16-body states included in @xmath11 are also included in @xmath22 .",
    "one then defines the effective interaction to be used for the @xmath4-body calculation as @xmath23 with increasing size of the model space , the effective interaction converges to the `` bare '' interaction , so that the `` bare '' problem is recovered , meaning that the approximation is controllable .    due to the cluster approximation , for @xmath24 we no longer have an exact effective interaction",
    "this shows up , for example , in an @xmath25 dependence of the binding energy .",
    "however , experience shows that shell - model calculations converge much faster , if performed with effective forces , as defined above @xcite .",
    "all calculations in this paper are based on effective interactions obtained from two - body cluster solutions .",
    "the binding energy @xmath28 evaluated in an approximate ground state must approach the exact binding energy @xmath29 as the energy variance @xmath30 vanishes .",
    "one can easily extrapolate the exact binding energy with a series of approximate calculations , once the behavior of @xmath26 as a function of @xmath27 is determined .",
    "it is suggested by mizusaki and imada that @xmath26 can be expanded in terms of @xmath31 for small values of @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "they propose two extrapolation formulae for traditional shell model calculations : @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath16 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 are fitting parameters .",
    "this has motivated us to search for the correlation between @xmath26 and @xmath27 in context of the ncsm , and establish an extrapolation method for the ncsm .      for the following investigation",
    "we need to explicitly define the model spaces . to this aim ,",
    "we truncate the full hilbert space spanned by the antisymmetrized ho basis at a maximum total ho quantum number @xmath36 . this @xmath36 counts the number of oscillator quanta including the lowest oscillator configuration for the nucleus of interest , differs from `` @xmath37 '' of refs .",
    "@xcite by the oscillator quanta of the lowest unperturbed oscillator configuration .",
    "thus @xmath38 for @xmath0h , and @xmath39 for @xmath1li . ] .",
    "this truncation ensures that all states are included up to a given energy , so that spurious cm motion can be projected out .",
    "the goal of the following study is to acquire results for a fixed @xmath36 from calculations for even smaller subspaces @xmath40 of @xmath11 truncated by @xmath41 .",
    "the effective interactions will be obtained for the larger @xmath36 in all cases .",
    "we now switch to matrix notation , because it helps to demonstrate the structure of the effective hamiltonian , @xmath42 , which can be decomposed into @xmath43 = \\mathbf{h}_0 + \\mathbf{h}_1,\\ ] ] where @xmath44 , \\mbox { and }   \\mathbf{h}_1 = \\left [ \\begin{array}{ll } \\mathbf{0 } & \\mathbf{b}\\\\   \\mathbf{b}^\\mathrm{t } & \\mathbf{0 } \\end{array } \\right ] .\\ ] ]    the boundaries of the blocks in @xmath42 are given by the truncation @xmath45 of the subspaces @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath46 acts only in @xmath40 and @xmath47 in the remainder space @xmath48 .",

    "we assume that @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the eigenvectors of @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively , i.e. , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the dimensions of @xmath40 and @xmath57 , respectively",

    "the quantity @xmath64 measures how well @xmath60 approximates the ground state of @xmath42 .",
    "as @xmath49 approaches @xmath36 , @xmath27 will vanish , and @xmath26 will become the true binding energy @xmath29 .    to establish a scaling between @xmath26 and @xmath64",
    ", we try to improve the results of @xmath46 using perturbation theory .",
    "several more approximations will be necessary to motivate the scaling .",
    "these approximations will be tested numerically in model calculations for the @xmath0h binding energy .",
    "we do not intend to improve on the currently available @xmath0h binding energy results @xcite , but restrict ourselves to the @xmath11 space truncated at @xmath65 , which yields realistic , but not fully converged results . here",
    "we will only aim to recover @xmath11-space results with @xmath66 calculations .",
    "note that this is in contrast to the usual ncsm calculations where one investigates the dependence on @xmath36 itself , and the effective interactions are renormalized for each @xmath36 .",
    "this also means that our results will explicitly depend on @xmath25 .",
    "but the small model space sizes used will allow us to extract intermediate results , which will demonstrate the origin of the scaling behavior .",
    "we will also show results for @xmath1li to demonstrate the applicability to more complex systems .      with the block - block decomposition",
    "( [ eq : bb ] ) , second - order perturbation theory gives the eigenenergy of @xmath42 , i.e. , @xmath67 , corresponding to @xmath68 , as @xmath69 the next non - vanishing perturbative term is of the 4th order . despite its simplicity and accuracy ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : aspt ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq : eipt ] ) is not useful in establishing a correlation between @xmath26 and @xmath27 , because it requires the knowledge of all the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath47",

    "for ncsm hamiltonians , this decomposition is appropriate ( see subsection [ sec : scalpert ] ) .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : des ] ) remains unchanged .",

    "up to the third order , we have @xmath77    figure [ fig : aspt ] shows the binding energy of @xmath0h calculated using equations ( [ eq : eipt ] ) , ( [ eq : ei2pt ] ) , and ( [ eq : ei3pt ] ) , and compares them to the results from the diagonalization of @xmath78 .",
    "this is done for two different nuclear interactions , cd - bonn @xcite and av18 @xcite , using a jacobi basis .",
    "this basis is obtained from the eigenstates of the antisymmetrizer ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the antisymmetrized states have a well defined total quantum number @xmath79 . within each group of equal @xmath79 , the states are ordered arbitrarily .",
    "terms acting on the cm do not contribute in this case .",
    "it is seen that the perturbative calculations can greatly improve small @xmath49 results , regardless of the choice of the nuclear interaction .",
    "figure [ fig : aspt ] also indicates that the third - order term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ei3pt ] ) is small for @xmath80 .",
    "this suggests that the non - diagonal matrix elements of @xmath47 , i.e. , @xmath81 , are small relative to their associated energy denominators in second - order perturbation theory .",
    "the expected scaling behavior can be motivated by considering the features and results of equations ( [ eq : ei2pt ] ) and ( [ eq : ei3pt ] ) . to this aim",

    "figure  [ fig : ash ] shows the matrix elements of the effective two - body hamiltonian and the effective two - body kinetic energy for our triton model both in the 3n basis .",
    "the effective kinetic energy is calculated in the same way as is the effective hamiltonian , except that the nn interaction is turned off . in this case , the cd - bonn potential is used with @xmath65 and @xmath83 mev . comparing the kinetic energy with the full hamiltonian , one sees that the kinetic energy dominates over the contributions from the nn interaction , especially for large ho quantum numbers . in the figure ,",
    "the basis states are ordered according to their total ho quantum number @xmath79 .",
    "the ordering within each of these groups is arbitrary .",
    "the potential energy affects mostly the low-@xmath79 states and the cross terms among them and high - lying states .",
    "the diagonal elements of the hamiltonian are dominant over off - diagonal elements , which confirms our expectation .",
    "it is also striking that a large number of the diagonal elements are roughly equal .",
    "the dark blocks next to the diagonals of the hamiltonian and the kinetic energy are due to the fact that the kinetic energy operator changes the quantum number @xmath79 by @xmath84 ( also 0 , which corresponds to the low - amplitude diagonal blocks ) . since everything is renormalized to effectively include the higher - space ( @xmath85 ) influence , @xmath86 terms show up in the hamiltonian and the kinetic energy , and they become progressively weaker towards low @xmath79 .",
    "the above properties persist for other interactions , and other values of @xmath25 or @xmath36 .",
    "they are a common feature of ncsm effective hamiltonians , at least for the 3n system .    the behavior of the diagonal matrix elements is quantified in fig .",
    "[ fig : diags ] .",
    "the upper panel shows individual diagonal elements , and , again , the basis states are ordered according their ho quantum number .",
    "the lower panel plots the averages of the diagonal elements that have equal @xmath79 .",
    "the step structure among the individual diagonal elements reflects the fact that @xmath82 is roughly the same in each group of states with the same ho quantum number .",
    "the reason for the flattening for larger @xmath79 is two - fold .",
    "first , the number of states increases dramatically for larger @xmath79 and , second , the renormalization of the effective matrix elements reduces large @xmath79 diagonal elements .",
    "this is seen by comparing the average effective kinetic energy ( circles ) with the bare kinetic energy ( squares ) , which is the expectation value of the kinetic energy operator with respect to ho basis states . for @xmath87 ,",
    "both follow the linear @xmath88 behavior as expected . for higher @xmath79",
    ", the effective kinetic energy turns flatter .",
    "the figure also compares the averaged diagonal elements of the full hamiltonians ( triangles ) to the ones of the kinetic energy .",
    "this again demonstrates the dominance of the kinetic energy for @xmath89 .",
    "one can expect that the same behavior holds for more complex nuclei .",
    "this structure of the effective hamiltonian guarantees that the denominators of the second - order term in equations ( [ eq : ei2pt ] ) and ( [ eq : ei3pt ] ) are , to a high accuracy , equal over a wide range of @xmath79 .",
    "thus , we have , approximately , @xmath90 where @xmath91 is a positive constant .",
    "since the absolute value of @xmath26 is much smaller than @xmath82 , the constant @xmath91 should be roughly the average value of the diagonal elements with @xmath92 .",
    "this also means that @xmath93 is only weakly dependent on @xmath26 . neglecting higher - order perturbative terms and taking a constant true binding energy @xmath29",
    ", it follows that @xmath94 .",
    "this motivates a linear scaling behavior between @xmath26 and @xmath64 .",
    ".the ground state energies , @xmath26 , of @xmath95 for @xmath0h , their deviation from the correct result @xmath96 , and the computational time necessary for the solution .",

    "the table indicates the computational efforts necessary by giving run times for different calculations .",
    "one sees that a stable extrapolation is possible starting from @xmath98 .",
    "the extrapolation error for larger calculations is comparable to the error of the perturbative estimates , indicating that both can be traced back to higher order terms in the perturbative expansion . in calculations for @xmath99",
    ", we have confirmed that the range of the linear behavior is extended for larger @xmath36 . this",
    "is expected because @xmath100 is driven by the kinetic energy and , therefore , is proportional to @xmath101 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : diags ] ) .",
    "consequently , if @xmath79 is increased by one step ( i.e. 2 units ) , then the change in @xmath100 is of order @xmath102 , which decreases with @xmath79 .",
    "we also note that the constant @xmath103  mev for cd - bonn with @xmath104  mev is comparable to the diagonal elements @xmath82 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diags ] .",
    "the effect of @xmath36 is demonstrated in table [ tab : errnm ] , where we list errors in perturbative estimates of the @xmath0h binding energy using equations ( [ eq : eipt ] ) and ( [ eq : ei2pt ] ) . the two equations are both of the second order , and the errors tend to decrease , though not monotonically , as the model space increases . at the same time ,",
    "table [ tab : errnm ] shows that the extrapolated binding energies converge to the results of equation ( [ eq : ei2pt ] ) .",
    "this is expected , because our extrapolation method , i.e. , equation ( [ eq : linreg ] ) , is based on an approximation of second - order perturbation theory .",
    "the behavior of the perturbative calculations and extrapolations suggests that one can reduce the extrapolation error by increasing @xmath36 .",
    "the run times are also compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : timing ] .",
    "it is clear that perturbation theory based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : eipt ] ) does not improve the timings because of the extra time needed to diagonalize @xmath47 . the extrapolation method for @xmath105 yields sufficiently accurate results , but reduces the cpu - time by a factor of 13 compared to the full calculation . a similarly accurate perturbative calculation based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : ei3pt ] ) is still 8 times slower , which demonstrates the usefulness of the extrapolation to extend the calculations beyond their current limits .",
    "we now apply the extrapolation method to the @xmath1li nucleus .",
    "the numerical results have been obtained using the many - fermion dynamics ( mfd ) code @xcite .",
    "since we work here in a basis of slater determinants , we guarantee a @xmath106 oscillator state of cm motion of our physical states by adding a cm term to equation ( [ eq : bb ] ) , @xmath107 @xcite , with @xmath108 .",
    "this separates excited states of cm motion from low lying physical states .",
    "figure [ fig : extrapli ] shows the results with @xmath109 ( i.e. , @xmath110 above the lowest unperturbed oscillator configuration of @xmath1li @xcite ) .",
    "the basis dimension of the @xmath109 calculations is 9.7 million , which is the largest model space published to date for @xmath1li .",
    "this low value of @xmath36 limits what @xmath49 values one can use in the extrapolation for two reasons .",
    "firstly , the potential energy is not negligible at small quantum numbers , so @xmath49 should be at least greater than 4 ( the ground state of @xmath1li has @xmath111 ) .",
    "secondly , the accuracy of the extrapolation depends on the dominance of the diagonal elements of @xmath42 , which is also weakened at small @xmath79 .",
    "thus , @xmath26 and @xmath64 from @xmath112 calculations are not in line with those from @xmath113 , and 12 .",
    "the extrapolation errors are 290 kev ( cd - bonn ) and 220 kev ( av18 ) .",
    "the cd - bonn potential provides 1.1 mev more binding than the av18 potential .",
    "thus , it is interesting to note that the difference between the two potentials is larger than the extrapolation error .",
    "the range of @xmath49 that is suitable for extrapolation is expected to increase with @xmath36 .",
    "this is confirmed in fig .",
    "[ fig : nm1012 ] , where an additional @xmath114 calculation is made for comparison .",
    "it is seen that the results are much more linear for the case @xmath115 .",
    "figure [ fig : nm1012 ] also demonstrates why a higher value of @xmath36 is likely to produce a smaller extrapolation error .",
    "we can estimate the lower and upper bounds of the constant @xmath91 , @xmath116 , in equation ( [ eq : linreg ] ) using effective kinetic energies and unperturbed ground state energies @xmath26 for @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "the results of @xmath49 calculations are consistent with second - order perturbation theory , because they are roughly bounded by @xmath119 and @xmath120 for each @xmath36 .",
    "the opening angle between the lines of slope @xmath121 and @xmath122 decreases as @xmath36 increases .",
    "hence , we expect to reduce the extrapolation error by increasing @xmath36 .",
    "because of the need for a large basis space to achieve accurate results , even light nuclei require a significant amount of computing resources to be investigated in the ncsm",
    ". we have justified and verified an extrapolation method for ncsm calculations .",
    "it is reliable , and can provide good estimates of large - space results from several small - space calculations .",
    "sometimes , it may be the only means for getting a useful estimate of the ncsm result for otherwise unachievable large model spaces .    the extrapolation formula proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite agrees in leading order with our eq .",
    "( [ eq : linreg ] ) .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the linear scaling between @xmath26 and @xmath64 is based on perturbation theory .",
    "it is not an expansion in terms of @xmath123 , because @xmath64 can be much greater than @xmath124 in the ncsm ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : extrap ] ) .",
    "the reasoning behind our extrapolation method is probably applicable only to ncsm calculations , because we have explicitly made use of the structure of the hamiltonian in our derivation .",
    "the linear scaling between @xmath26 and @xmath64 relies on the flattening of the diagonal elements of the effective hamiltonian ( dominated by the kinetic energy ) as @xmath79 approaches @xmath36 . with this behavior ,",
    "the energy denominator in equation ( [ eq : ei2pt ] ) can be approximated by a constant @xmath91 .",
    "generally speaking , extrapolation methods depend not only on the structure of the hamiltonian but also on the truncation scheme that is used to produce an approximate state .",
    "different truncation schemes may lead to different scaling behavior @xcite .",
    "the traditional phenomenological shell model does not generate the structure of the hamiltonian that is advantageous for our method . specifically , in calculations with a core diagonal dominance is reduced since energies relative to a core are obtained . for realistic mean field potentials , the single particle spectrum does not rise as fast as an oscillator spectrum which itself does not rise as fast as the kinetic spectrum in an oscillator basis .",
    "hence , the diagonal dominance we have in the ncsm is much stronger than the traditional shell model , and our method probably can not be applied to the traditional shell model without modifications . on the other hand , the methods for the traditional shell model do not necessarily apply to the ncsm either .",
    "in fact , it is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : extrapli ] that a quadratic fit @xcite to the @xmath125 , 8 , and 10 results will yield a significantly larger error .    from table [ tab : errnm",
    "] we have learned that for small model spaces there are two competing sources of inaccuracy : one in the perturbation theory result and the other in the extrapolated result .",
    "we have shown that the extrapolated result is converging to the perturbation theory result , equation ( [ eq : ei2pt ] ) . in table",
    "[ tab : errnm ] one sees that the deviation of equation ( [ eq : ei2pt ] ) and the extrapolation is already small even for relatively small values of @xmath36 , e.g. , @xmath126 .",
    "since perturbation theory requires larger @xmath36 , around 16 , to give estimates of similar accuracy , we can conclude that overall our results are probably dominated by errors due to perturbation theory .",
    "this method , like ncsm calculations themselves , is limited by the size of the model - space , because @xmath64 has to be evaluated in the full @xmath11 space .",
    "nevertheless , it has been shown to be a valuable tool .",
    "its power is based on the much smaller dimension of the @xmath76 matrix compared to the full matrix for the hamiltonian operator .",
    "calculations for even larger model spaces will become possible once we make explicit use of the small dimension of the @xmath76 matrix in our codes .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : extrap ] and [ fig : extrapli ] , we observe that the extrapolation error , i.e. , @xmath127 , at @xmath128 is quite small compared with differences in exact results of @xmath29 for various values of @xmath129 or choices of potentials .",
    "therefore , the extrapolation can also serve as a way to estimate the uncertainties of ncsm results arising from @xmath130 dependence and choices of interactions",
