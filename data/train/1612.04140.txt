    "the quintessential @xmath0-radioactivity has been studied by many physicists so far and has opened doors for laying a rigid foundation and development of nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "gamow was the first and foremost to apply quantum mechanics to a nuclear physics problem by providing the first model to explain @xmath0-decay and propounded that the process involves tunneling of an @xmath0-particle through a large barrier @xcite .",
    "a profound knowledge of this quantum mechanical effect enables one to obtain the geiger - nuttall law which relates the decay constant of a radioactive isotope with the energy of the @xmath0 particles emitted .",
    "wkb approximations have been applied to study @xmath0-decay rate of many elements .",
    "lifetimes of several heavy elements with @xmath1 have been estimated by theoretically calculating the quantum mechanical tunneling probability in a wkb framework and also using the @xmath2 effective nuclear interaction whose results have shown good agreement over a wide range of experimental datas @xcite .",
    "our acquaintance with the well known geiger - nuttall ( gn ) law is age old .",
    "in fact , the formulation of the geiger - nuttall ( gn ) law in 1911 was a landmark in itself .",
    "the gn law states that the @xmath0-decay half life @xmath3 is related to the energy of @xmath0-decay process ( @xmath0-decay value ) @xmath4 as @xmath5 , where a(z ) and b(z ) are the coefficients which are determined by fitting experimental data @xcite .",
    "the gn law holds good for a restricted experimental data sets available but is invalid in general .",
    "in retrospect , we can see that although gn law gives a single straight line but if we consider the experimental data of @xmath0-particle emitters including heavy and super heavy nuclei with proton numbers as large as 118 , instead of getting a single linear path we observe several linear segments with different slopes and intercepts .",
    "this problem is overcome when the experimental results in logarithm form are plotted as a function of viola - seaborg ( vs ) parameter , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are constants @xcite .",
    "the striking feature of empirical viola - seaborg ( vs ) rule i.e @xmath10 with @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , is its superiority over gn law as it satisfactorily results in a straight line for a wide range of experimental data . as stated before the vs rule is precise but is an empirical one .",
    "thus we strive for a formula of logarithm of half - lives in terms of well - defined parameters or coefficients so that the empirical nature of vs rule is apparently obscured .",
    "qi et al . have mentioned the validity and generalization of the gn law along with its microscopic basis .",
    "also they have incorporated the tunneling process in the r - matrix theory and put forth an extended form of gn law@xcite .    to fully understand the r - matrix theory for the decay of a cluster or a particle , we look from the perspective of s - matrix theory of resonance scattering or the transition scattering from an isolated quasi - bound state to a scattering state as detailed in @xcite . for completeness , we can highlight the method as follows :    in s - matrix method , resonance is considered as a pole in the complex energy plane . adding to that ,",
    "the real part of the pole signifies the resonance energy or the q - value of decay and the imaginary part represents the width which in turn gives the decay half - life of the system constituting of an @xmath0-cluster and the residual nucleus @xcite .    in the context of transition from quasi - bound state to a scattering state ,",
    "we can write the width in terms of wave function at resonance and coulomb functions in two ways :    i)by matching the normalized regular solution u(r ) of the modified schrdinger equation and the distorted outgoing coulomb function at a distance @xmath15 is @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the regular and irregular coulomb functions .",
    "thus , the decay width @xcite is expressed as @xmath19    ii)we express the general formula of the @xmath0-decay width @xcite as follows : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a bound initial state for the decaying nucleus and @xmath22 is a final scattering state for the @xmath23daughter system .",
    "the hamiltonians @xmath24 and h are associated with @xmath22 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "both the expressions are same in one way or another . precisely in the first expression @xmath25",
    "depends on a radial distance r which is represented crudely .",
    "this results in uncertainty in measuring certain data .",
    "it is interesting at this point to consider the second formula which is more effective in deriving an analytical expression for half - life in terms of the resonant wave function of an exactly solvable potential and the regular coulomb function .",
    "ultimately , by applying approximations on the functions of the expression of half - life , we derive a condensed formula for the logarithm of half - life in terms of the decay energy and mass and charge numbers of the @xmath0-emitter .",
    "it is noteworthy that the found out condensed formula bear close resemblance with the vs rule .",
    "thus we can say that finding half - lives from a derived formula is the paramount of this paper .    in section ii we describe in detail the formulation and derivation of half - lives . in section iii the formula",
    "is being implemented .",
    "section iv includes the conclusion of the sought problem .",
    "we remark that the @xmath0-decay process where the @xmath0-cluster in the decaying nucleus is controlled by an attractive nuclear potential , @xmath26 and the @xmath0-particle outside the nucleus by the point - charge coulomb potential i.e @xmath27 .    in a simple picture",
    "we represent @xmath28 as the difference between the potentials in the two cases viz . the nuclear potential and the point - charge coulomb potential i.e @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the coulomb potential given by @xmath31    in our approach",
    ", we calculate the decay width by taking into account the @xmath0-decay process where there is transition of an @xmath0-cluster from an isolated quasi - bound state to a scattering state .",
    "the initial system is related with the instability with the quasi - bound state of the decaying nucleus . along with",
    "that the final state is the scattering state of the @xmath0-daughter system .",
    "now , we solve the schrdinger equation using the effective potential which is the amalgamation of the nuclear potential and the electrostatic potential to get the radial part of the initial and final state of the wave function .",
    "the radial part of the initial state wave function is @xmath32 additionally , the final state wave function can be written considering the motion of the @xmath0-particle relative to the daughter nucleus as a scattering state wave function corresponding to the @xmath0-particle in point charge coulomb potential @xcite : @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 stands for the center - of - mass energy , @xmath36 is the reduced mass of the system with @xmath37 giving the mass of a nucleon , @xmath38 represent the mass number of @xmath0 particle , @xmath39 represent the mass number of the daughter nucleus and @xmath40 is the regular coulomb wave function for a given partial wave @xmath41 .",
    "the factor @xmath42 is a normalization factor of the scattering wave function .",
    "the mean - field approximation @xcite is applied for the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "moreover , the process of double folding of the @xmath23nucleus potential @xmath26 along with the electrostatic term , we get a parabola at a close radial distance r. again simulation of the effective potential as a function of distance is done and is solved exactly in the schrdinger equation .",
    "consequently the solution of which is the wave function @xmath43 for @xmath44 in the interior region .",
    "based on the gell - mann - goldberger transformation @xcite , the expression for the decay width becomes @xmath45 for the normalization of the interior wave function the factor @xmath46 is used .",
    "the resonant wave function @xmath43 decreases rapidly with distance outside the coulomb barrier radius @xmath47 . for this reason",
    ", we apply the box normalization condition for the wave function @xmath48 for @xmath49 .    also , we are quite familiar with the relation between decay half - life @xmath3 and the width : @xmath50 by using ( 9 ) , we get a new expression of @xmath3 @xmath51 @xmath52 now",
    ", the regular coulomb wave function @xmath53 can be expressed as @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 , sommerfeld parameter @xmath56 , @xmath57 @xmath58 in particular , for @xmath44 , @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 we make a lay out ( figs .",

    "it is visible from the plot that the integrand shows a peak in the region close to the coulomb barrier radius , @xmath70 fm .",
    "the plots indicate that the wave function of the resonance state decreases exponentially in the barrier region .",
    "also the potential difference ie .",
    "@xmath71 becomes zero in the region @xmath72 .",
    "but the coulomb function is very small at small values of r. we also find that , although the integrand j is dependent on distance r = r but it is independent of the distance r in the region @xmath72 .",
    "thus the value of decay time @xmath3 which is dependent on j is rather independent of r in the region @xmath72 .",
    "we use a potential @xcite which is a function of radial variable r and can be represented in the form as follows : @xmath73 & { if\\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; r \\le r_0,}\\\\ v_0s_2\\rho",
