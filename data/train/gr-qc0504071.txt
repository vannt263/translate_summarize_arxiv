    "binary star systems are excellent sources of gravitational waves , and with roughly two - thirds of the @xmath0@xmath1 stars in our galaxy in binary systems , there will be no shortage of targets for the proposed laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) @xcite .",
    "binaries with periods less than a day may potentially dominate the response of the lisa observatory .",
    "indeed , it is likely that the main source of noise for lisa over a portion of its band will be unresolved gravitational wave signals from galactic and extra - galactic binary star systems .",
    "several studies @xcite have sought to model these populations and estimate their contribution to the gravitational wave power spectrum . in some instances these estimates have been combined with data analysis considerations to make predictions of the confusion noise caused by unresolved sources .",
    "although a consensus has not formed on the expected background level , it is generally accepted that a galactic gravitational wave background does exist inside the lisa band .",
    "the difficultly in developing strong limits on the background level originate from the expectation that the background will be dictated by compact binaries , that is , binary systems that contain white dwarfs , neutron stars , and stellar mass black holes . since the electromagnetic luminosity of compact binaries is low , not enough sources",
    "have been observed yet to build reliable models for the populations .",
    "if current estimates of compact binary populations reasonably represent the true nature of the galaxy , then the superposition of gravitational wave signals from these populations will form a confusion limited background in the lisa band .",
    "that is , there will be enough sources that the received signals will interfere with each other to the point where individual binaries can not be resolved  @xcite .",
    "when this occurs the background becomes a source of noise in the detector .",
    "however , around ten thousand systems will be resolvable due to either their isolation in frequency space ( for sources with frequencies above @xmath03  mhz ) or their relative brightness ( for sources below @xmath03  mhz ) .    here",
    "we present a monte carlo model for the galactic gravitational wave background .",
    "our goal is to better understand the role played by the rare , bright sources that dominate the observed signal , and to provide a more realistic level of the confusion background due to unresolved compact binaries .",
    "our investigation of the galactic gravitational wave background is done in two phases .",
    "the first phase is to build a monte carlo simulation of the background by modeling each binary and processing the corresponding gravitational wave signal through a model of lisa . to reasonably represent the individual types of binaries we follow the population models presented in @xcite and @xcite , which from here on will be referred to as hbw and nyz respectively . though less up to date , the hbw model has the advantage of being expressed in terms of explicit distribution functions , which allows us to generate multiple realizations .",
    "the more modern nyz model employs a population synthesis code that has not been made public , so we were not able to generate our own realizations .",
    "gils nelemans was kind enough to send us a realization of the nyz model to work with .",
    "the second phase of our study is to statistically characterize features of the galactic background as they are observed by lisa .    as part of the modeling phase",
    ", the signal from each source is run through a realistic model of the lisa instrument response to produce simulated interferometry data . in doing so , it was necessary to develop a new , fast algorithm for computing the detector response in order to process the @xmath0@xmath2 sources modeled in each realization .",
    "the algorithm is based on the frequency domain approach developed by @xcite , and extended to include the detector transfer functions , arbitrary observation times , and frequency evolution of the sources . for the current study we set the observation time at @xmath3 .",
    "examples of our simulated lisa data streams can be found at the _ _ mock lisa data archive__.    using the simulated detector data we investigate issues that are of importance to the development of future data analysis algorithms . among the quantities we investigate are tests of gaussianity in the distribution of fourier coefficients before and after bright sources are removed , the number and type of bright sources , and the density ( in frequency space ) of bright sources .",
    "our interest in bright systems stems from the idea that they will be identifiable in the data streams , and thus removable",
    ". they will also be instrumental in using the real gravitational wave data to study galactic populations and galaxy evolution .    to model the removal of bright systems we use an iterative procedure using a running median of co - added instrument noise and galactic signals as the effective noise level .",
    "sources were considered bright if they had a signal noise ratio ( snr ) greater than some threshold with respect to the effective noise level .",
    "we considered both optimistic ( @xmath4 ) and conservative ( @xmath5 ) thresholds .",
    "as the bright sources are regressed from the data , the effective noise level drops , allowing more sources to be resolved .",
    "after several iterations we are left with a residual signal that is our estimate of the galactic confusion noise .",
    "previous estimates of the confusion noise were derived by setting a maximum source density , with the reasoning that it would be impossible to resolve individual sources when the number of sources per @xmath6 frequency bin exceeded some threshold .",
    "here we took a different approach that is based primarily on snr thresholds , but we also studied the effect of a source density cut - off .",
    "rather than working with the total source density we based our cut - off on the density of resolved sources . in other words , we considered the possibility that there will be a maximum number of sources that can be resolved per frequency bin .",
    "we studied the effect of a resolved source density cut - off by performing the iterative removals with and without a cut - off on the number of sources that could be resolved per frequency bin ( we set a limit of one source per four bins ) .",
    "for some models the source density cut - off had a significant impact , but for other models the cut - off made very little difference .",
    "our estimate of the confusion level for the hbw model differs from that of @xcite despite the fact that we use the same galactic model .",
    "our estimate of the confusion level for the nyz model agrees fairly well with the @xcite estimate . in both cases ,",
    "our estimate is lower at low frequencies ( below 1 or 2 mhz respectively ) , and higher at high frequencies .",
    "the differences are due to our differing approaches to modeling the signal identification and regression .",
    "we feel that our approach yields more realistic estimates .",
    "all our examples are for one year of observations , so the frequency bins have width @xmath7 hz .",
    "the level of the confusion background will drop for longer observation times as the sidebands get better resolved and the snr increases .",
    "the reduction in the confussion noise over time means that fits to transient sources that occur in the first year of operation , such as a supermassive black hole merger , will continue to get better with time even though the source disappeared years ago !",
    "recently @xcite and @xcite simulated lisa time series for a population of galactic white dwarf binaries . while comparable to our approach , neither simulation was used to study source identification and subtraction .",
    "the statistical analysis of the background given in @xcite focuses on the cyclostationary nature of the signal , whereas our statistical analysis focuses on simulating data analysis in order to better understand the galactic gravitational wave background .    since the study of the galactic gravitational wave background naturally divides itself into two sections , modeling and characterization , the outline of the paper follows suite .",
    "sections  [ sec : model ] and [ sec : detector_background ] are devoted to a description of the monte carlo simulation of the galactic close binary populations .",
    "it is here that we describe how the individual sources are modeled and convolved with a lisa response model .",
    "the next three sections calculate a number of statistical properties associated with the galactic background .",
    "section  [ sec : gauss ] demonstrates that the galactic background is non - gaussian in nature . in section  [ sec : clb ] we present our estimate of the confusion limited background and compare it to prior estimates .",
    "section  [ sec : bright_sources ] describes the characteristics of the systems that are labeled as bright .",
    "the paper concludes in section  [ sec : conclusion ] with a discussion of the various assumptions used in the simulation and how changes in these assumptions may alter our results .",
    "the first step in building a monte carlo realization of the galaxy is to model an individual binary system . in general",
    ", a gravitational wave traveling in the @xmath8 direction can be decomposed into two polarizations states , @xmath9 where @xmath10 are basis tensors used to describe the radiation s orientation .",
    "the scalar coefficients are referred to as the gravitational waveforms . for a circular binary with instantaneous angular orbital frequency @xmath11 , and component mass @xmath12 and @xmath13 the waveforms measured at the barycenter of the solar system are    [ eq : waveforms_background ] @xmath14    where the polarization amplitudes are given by    [ eq : pol_amps ] @xmath15    the angles @xmath16 and @xmath17 describe the orientation of the binary as viewed by an observer in the barycenter frame , while @xmath18 is the initial phase .",
    "gravitational waves carry away energy and angular momentum from the emitting system .",
    "consequently a binary will slowly inspiral over time . for stellar mass galactic sources in the lisa band the period evolution",
    "can be adequately described by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the so - called chirp mass and @xmath21 is the initial orbital period .",
    "equation   does make the assumption , which is used throughout this paper , that no other processes ( e.g. mass transfer ) are evolved in the binary evolution besides gravitational wave emission .",
    "equations  , , and indicate that a circular binary is uniquely determined by a set of nine parameters : the component masses ( @xmath22 ) , initial orbital period ( @xmath21 ) , binary orientation @xmath23 ) , initial phase ( @xmath18 ) , and the distance to the source ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "additionally , two angular variables ( @xmath25 ) are used to locate the source on the celestial sphere . to model an individual binary",
    "requires an accurate representation of these nine parameters .",
    "the list of source parameters are separable into those that are extrinsic and intrinsic to the system .",
    "the extrinsic variables @xmath26 do not influence the evolution of the binary .",
    "instead they depend on the time of observation and on the location of the observer with respect to the binary . the remaining variables",
    "@xmath27 directly effect the binary evolution through the emission of gravitational waves via equation  .",
    "for the set of extrinsic variables there is a further separation into those that locate the source @xmath28 and those that describe the time of observation and orientation as viewed by a particular observer @xmath29 . to derive a unique location for each source we use a cylindrically symmetric disk model of the galaxy with an exponential falloff in both the radial and vertical directions , @xmath30 here",
    "@xmath31 is the space density at the galactic center , @xmath32 is the radial scale length , and @xmath33 is the vertical scale height of the galactic disk .",
    "the values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 vary with the different types of binaries ( i.e. cataclysmic variables , white dwarf binaries , etc . ) , but all types are assumed to obey the above model .",
    "the binary positions are simply described in galactocentric - cylindrical coordinates .",
    "the natural coordinate system for the lisa mission is heliocentric - ecliptic coordinates .",
    "therefore , once the positions for the binaries are selected using the galactic position distributions , they are translated to the lisa coordinate system through a series of standard coordinate transformations .",
    "the observed orientation of a binary system is set by the principal polarization angle @xmath16 and the inclination angle @xmath17 .",
    "the inclination angle is defined as the angle between the line of sight to the binary @xmath34 and the angular momentum vector of the binary @xmath35 . the inner product of @xmath34 and the angular momentum directions @xmath36 is taken to be uniformly distributed between @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the principle polarization angle describes the orientation of the semi - major axis of the projected binary orbit on the celestial sphere and is uniformly distributed between 0 and @xmath39 .",
    "the distribution for @xmath18 , which describes the positions of the binary components at time @xmath40 , is uniformly distributed between 0 and @xmath41 .",
    "the distributions for each intrinsic parameter @xmath42 depends on the binary type under consideration . to model each of these parameters we used the distributions given in hbw . for this reason",
    "our galactic backgrounds include w  uma ( @xmath43 ) , cataclysmic variables ( @xmath44 ) , neutron star - neutron star ( @xmath45 ) , black hole - neutron star ( @xmath46 ) , and close white dwarf ( @xmath47 ) binaries .",
    "the quantities in the parentheses indicates how many systems of that type are included in the simulation .",
    "note that for most of our analyses we use the 10% reduced population of close white dwarf binaries as described in hbw as this allows us to to compare directly with prior results .",
    "we have elected not to include the unevolved binaries .",
    "the reason for this is that they are predominately very low frequency sources ( @xmath48  hz ) . as a result",
    ", their signals will be buried in the instrumental noise and , therefore , will not contribute to the observed galactic background .",
    "many of the prior studies of the galactic background approached the problem by estimating the net gravitational wave luminosity as a function of frequency in the solar system barycenter . from the luminosity",
    "they then derive a gravitational wave strain amplitude using @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the gravitational wave angular frequency and luminosity respectively .    in order to make comparisons between our results and prior studies ,",
    "we must relate the above expression for the strain amplitude to quantities calculated in our monte carlo simulation . to this end",
    ", we first note the relationship between gravitational wave luminosity and flux @xcite , @xmath52 where the angle brackets denote an average over several gravitational wave periods . using this relationship the strain amplitude is rewritten as @xmath53 from the waveforms given in equation",
    "it follows that @xmath54 the polarization amplitudes , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , are functions of the binary masses , distance to the source , orbital period , and inclination angle ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq : pol_amps ] ] ) .",
    "equation   gives the strain amplitude for a single source . to mimic a power spectrum in the solar system barycenter frame we first bin the sources according to their frequencies .",
    "the bin widths are @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the total observation time ( for our simulations @xmath58 is set to one year ) . once the sources are sorted the net strain amplitude per frequency bin is calculated from @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the number of sources in the bin .",
    "note that equation   accounts for constructive and destructive interference in the same way as in standard data analysis uncorrelated , random errors add quadratically with the square root taken after all errors have been included .",
    "similarly for the background , the net strain amplitude is the square root of all individual polarization amplitudes added quadratically .",
    "figure  [ fig : sources_barycenter ] compares our monte carlo results to hbw .",
    "( note that the plots show spectral amplitudes @xmath61 , not strain amplitudes @xmath62 . for monochromatic binaries",

    "for the compact binaries the orbital period distributions have a small , but finite , probability at short periods .",
    "consequently it takes a large number of draws against the period distribution to produce a source with an extremely short period . in the cases of the neutron star - neutron star and close white dwarf binaries",
    "the probability in the period distribution tails becomes small enough that for the number of sources included in our simulated background one would not expected a large number of extremely short period ( high frequency ) sources .",
    "this is why the hbw data extends beyond our simulated backgrounds .",
    "figure  [ fig : barycenter_background ] shows the total galactic background as viewed in the barycenter frame .",
    "hz is due to sudden increase in the number of w  uma binaries .",
    "had we included a realization of the unevolved binaries , the background levels would be roughly constant below @xmath65  hz with a spectral amplitude of @xmath66.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the sharp rise in the background at @xmath67  hz is due to the sudden increase in the number of w  uma binaries .",
    "the signal below @xmath67  hz is due to neutron star - neutron star binaries .",
    "if the unevolved binaries had been included , the galactic background would be approximately constant between 1 and 100  @xmath68hz at a level of @xmath69 .",
    "as @xcite found with their population synthesis models of the galaxy , when the individual sources are modeled the background appears spiky .",
    "the large fluctuations in the background are due to a small number of bright sources .",
    "as we will show later , when these sources are removed from the background the spectrum becomes smooth .",
    "it is generally agreed that a confusion limited background arises when the average number of source per frequency bin is larger than unity .",
    "( additionally the net strain per bin must also be larger than the intrinsic detector noise . )",
    "figure  [ fig : num_per_bin ] shows that the peak number of sources per bin is in excess of @xmath70 near 0.04  mhz .",
    "hz is associated with the neglected unevolved binaries.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the plot also demonstrates that for a large portion of lisa s spectrum the number of sources per bin is greater than ten .",
    "the backgrounds presented in the previous section were not convolved with a model for the instrument response . as with all fields of astronomy",
    ", the act of measuring incident radiation has to be properly understood in order to correctly interpret the signals . in this section",
    "we first summarize the lisa mission and then describe our models for the detector response .",
    "we then present the simulated galactic background as measured by the detector .",
    "lisa is a joint esa / nasa mission planned for launch around 2015 .",
    "the mission consists of three identical spacecraft in separate , slightly eccentric , heliocentric orbits inclined with respect to the ecliptic plane @xcite .",
    "the orbits are carefully chosen such that the spacecraft constellation will form , and approximately maintain , an equilateral triangle with a mean spacecraft separation of @xmath71  km .",
    "the center of the constellation , referred to as the guiding center , will have an orbital radius of 1  au and trail the earth by @xmath72 . during the course of one orbit , the constellation will cartwheel once with a retrograde motion as seen by an observer at the sun .",
    "lisa is sensitivity to gravitational radiation in the range of @xmath73 to 1  hz .",
    "the detector s motion introduces amplitude ( am ) , frequency ( fm ) , and phase modulations ( pm ) into the gravitational wave signals @xcite .",
    "the amplitude modulation originates from the detector s motion sweeping the antenna pattern across the sky .",
    "the phase modulation results from the differing responses to each polarization state .",
    "the frequency ( doppler ) modulation is due to the motion of the detector relative to the source .",
    "since the bulk orbital and cartwheel motions both have a period of one year , the resulting modulations appear as sidebands in the power spectrum separated from the instantaneous carrier frequency by integer values of the modulation frequency , @xmath74 .    for our studies",
    "the detector response is modeled using a combination of the _ extended low frequency approximation _",
    ", which is developed in the appendix , and the _ rigid adiabatic approximation _ as described in @xcite .",
    "as explained in the appendix , to save on computational costs it is advantageous to simulate the detector response directly in the frequency domain where a quasi - monochromatic source will only have a small number of sidebands . at low frequencies , the bandwidth for a slowly evolving circular",
    "binary is @xmath75 where @xmath76  au is the orbital radius of lisa and @xmath77 is the colatitude of the source on the celestial sphere . for sources with gravitational wave frequencies below a few millihertz ,",
    "the bandwidth is less than @xmath78 and we can achieve a considerable saving in computational cost by working in the frequency domain . at higher frequencies the sources have larger bandwidths , more complex modulation patterns , and signals that evolve significantly in frequency , making them harder to model directly in the frequency domain .    in the appendix",
    "it is shown that the _ extended low frequency approximation _ , which is applied in the frequency domain , is only valid for frequencies below 7  mhz .",
    "for the few hundred signals with a carrier frequency above this cutoff , we use the more accurate time domain response model , the _ rigid adiabatic approximation_. to combine the results from each approximation , we first simulate the response for the signals that are above 7  mhz using the more detailed _ rigid adiabatic approximation _ and add them linearly in the time domain .",
    "we then perform a fast fourier transform . for the sources that are simulated directly in the frequency domain",
    ", we coherently add the signals by summing the real and imaginary parts of their respective fourier coefficients at each frequency . by adding the coefficients we maintain the phase information which dictates the constructive and destructive interference of the gravitational waves .",
    "the final detector response is the sum of the fourier coefficients from the extended low frequency and adiabatic results .",
    "it is also at this time that we add in a detector noise realization using the prescription given in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : detector_background ] shows a particular realization for a michelson signal in the frequency domain .",
    "figure  [ fig : detector_background_time ] shows the same signal in the time domain .            in comparing the background as observed in the detector frame ( fig .",
    "[ fig : detector_background ] ) versus in the barycentric frame ( fig .",
    "[ fig : barycenter_background ] ) a striking feature is that it is lower by roughly a full decade across the entire spectrum .",
    "the reduction is due to two effects .",
    "the first effect is the detector efficiency , which relates the total signal power in the detector to the total signal power at the barycenter .",
    "the all - sky and polarization averaged detector efficiency is equal to @xmath79 at low frequencies , and gets progressively worse at high frequencies .",
    "( this is immediately evident by comparing the sensitivity curve in figure  [ fig : barycenter_background ] to the average michelson noise in figure  [ fig : detector_background ] . )",
    "the second effect is due to the orbital motion of the detector . in the barycentric frame ,",
    "most galactic binaries are well approximated as monochromatic .",
    "as lisa moves in its orbit the monochromatic signals are modulated across multiple frequency bins . at high frequencies the spreading effects are evident by spectral power showing up in bins that were previously empty in the barycenter frame . at low frequencies",
    "the expectation is that the spreading from adjacent bins will cancel out due to the numerous sources found in each bin ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : num_per_bin ] ) .",
    "however , as will be shown in the next two sections , the galactic background is dominated by a few bright sources . when the bright sources are modulated there is not a compensating bright source in the adjacent bin . as a result",
    "the galactic background is also reduced at lower frequencies .",
    "of great interest to the lisa mission is to broadly characterize the galactic gravitational background in a statistical sense .",
    "such a characterization is essential to the development and implementation of data analysis algorithms which often make assumptions about the character of the noise .    in the spectral regions of lisa s band where the galactic background dominates the detector response ,",
    "the background becomes a source of noise . by inspection of the spectrum in figure  [ fig : detector_background ] ,",
    "the galaxy is evident by the jaggedness between 0.1 and 10  mhz . outside this region",
    "the galactic binary signals are weaker than the intrinsic detector noise .",
    "this is evident in the plot by the relative smoothness of the spectrum from bin - to - bin .",
    "one way to characterize the background is to statistically study the fourier coefficient distributions in different regions of the spectrum . of specific interest",
    "is finding out if the galactic background is characterized by a gaussian distribution .",
    "tests for gaussianity are done using independent @xmath80 and kolmogorov - smirnov tests .",
    "the gauss tests are performed over a window of 512 bins and done at each frequency .",
    "figure  [ fig : gauss_test ] shows the results of the kolmogorov - smirnov test performed on the real coefficients for the spectrum shown in figure  [ fig : detector_background ] .    .",
    "the presence of the galactic background is apparent by the low @xmath81 values about @xmath82  hz . similar results are found for the imaginary coefficients , for the other data channels , and when using a @xmath80 test.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the @xmath81 values plotted along the ordinate axis are the probabilities that the set of measured deviates are gaussian distributed .",
    "while it is impossible to say with certainty that a set of measured deviates are necessarily distributed with a specific distribution , they can be shown not to agree .",
    "values for @xmath81 above a hundredth are usually accepted as agreeing with the tested distribution function . for @xmath81 values below a hundredth , which are seen in the millihertz region of the detector output ,",
    "indicate that the measured set of data is not gaussian distributed .    comparing the results of the gaussian test ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gauss_test ] ) and the original lisa output ( fig .  [ fig : detector_background ] ) indicates that the detector response is non - gaussian for frequencies in which the background is above the intrinsic detector noise level . outside these regions , where the detector s noise dominates the output , the returned @xmath81 values are consistent with a gaussian distribution , as they should since the simulation of the noise is based on gaussian distributions .",
    "similar results are found for the imaginary coefficients , other channels of data , and when calculated using a @xmath80 test .",
    "a common misconception is that the galactic background should be gaussian distributed .",
    "this assumption is based on the central limit theorem , which states that for a large sample of random deviates , regardless of their parent distribution , the distribution of average values will be approximately gaussian .",
    "however , the central limit theorem is not directly applicable to the galactic background since the net power in a single frequency bin may be dictated by a single bright source .",
    "moreover , in a small region of the spectrum there are very few bright sources .",
    "far less than the large number of data points required for the central limit theorem to apply .",
    "large fluctuations originating from bright sources cause the tails of the expected gaussian distributions to be enlarged .",
    "if the bright sources were removed from the data streams , then the remaining background would be gaussian . to demonstrate this we first identify the bright sources , subtract them , and then retest the remaining background for gaussianity .",
    "identifying all the bright sources in the actual lisa data streams is a difficult problem not yet fully solved .",
    "the modulation effects caused by lisa s orbital motion spread a source s spectral power across multiple frequency bins .",
    "although the bandwidth over which a signal will spread is a known function of the gravitational wave frequency and sky position , if multiple signals are overlapping in a small region of frequency space , the true number of signals in the region may not be clearly identifiable . for our monte carlo models ,",
    "when we generate each binary , the parameter values for each system are known . with this extra information",
    "we can quickly and accurately identify bright sources and remove them from the data streams .",
    "our approach to identifying bright sources is to categorize them according to their signal - to - noise ( snr ) ratio using the standard formula , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the fourier transform of the noiseless response to a single gravitational wave signal , and @xmath85 is the one - sided noise power spectral density .",
    "a source is labeled as `` bright '' if its snr is greater than 5 ( optimistic ) or 10 ( conservative ) .",
    "the proper use of equation   requires a clear interpretation of the noise .",
    "we are interested in removing sources that are bright relative to the local power spectrum level .",
    "therefore , the @xmath85 curve must be a composite of the intrinsic detector noise and the galactic background .",
    "it is an effective noise for the detector , which we will emphasize by denoting it as @xmath86 .    to approximate the effective noise",
    "we calculate the median detector output . while representing the effective noise by the median response ( as opposed to the mean response ) is somewhat stable against bright sources , in regions near an extremely large snr signal or where the density of bright sources is large , the median will still be influenced by these few signals . to account for the influence of the bright sources in calculating the @xmath86 curve , we perform our calculations iteratively .",
    "we start with the median response of the initial output and calculate the number of bright sources with reference to this curve .",
    "we then remove the bright sources exactly using the same detector response approximation that generated them .",
    "the justification for using the exact parameters is a matter of simplicity , since data analysis algorithms are still being developed .",
    "moreover , with a snr threshold of 10 the errors in the recovered parameters will be small .",
    "the result of removing the bright sources is a new background from which we can calculate a new median response . from the new median response",
    "we calculate the number of bright sources with respect to the new @xmath86 curve .",
    "we iterate this procedure until there are no new bright sources being identified . in some examples , such as with the 100% hbw model",
    ", the procedure does not appear to converge , so the subtraction was stopped after 10 iterations .",
    "previous estimates  @xcite of the confusion background ignored the relative brightness of the sources and focused instead on the source density .",
    "these estimates defined the confusion regime in terms of the number of sources per frequency bin .",
    "outside of the confusion regime sources could be resolved and removed , while inside the confusion regime the sources acted as a source of noise .",
    "this notion of source confusion is based on linear algebra : the signal from each galactic binary is described by 7 or 8 parameters  @xcite , and there are 4 data points per frequency bin ( two independent channels , each with a real and imaginary part ) .",
    "thus , one needs at least 2 frequency bins per source to have as many data points as there are unknowns .",
    "while this estimate is very crude , it is unlikely that a data analysis algorithm can be found that beats the 0.5 source per bin saturation point by very much ( methods such as maximum entropy  @xcite introduce priors that can help tame under constrained systems , but they can only do so much ) . in order to study the effect of a source density cut - off we repeat the snr based source subtraction procedure with a maximum resolved source density of 0.25 sources per bin using a 100 bin average",

    "a different collection of models of the extrinsic parameters may return a slightly different set of results as is seen in the nyz backgrounds .",

    "the number of binary sources in the galaxy can impart a noticeable difference in the background levels .",

    "statistically the problem is analogous to a random walk . as a result",

    "electromagnetically visible binaries ( w  uma , unevolved , and cataclysmic binaries ) galactic surveys have placed stringent constraints on the total number of such binaries .",
    "however , for the compact binaries ( neutron star - neutron star , black hole - neutron star , and white dwarf binaries ) equivalent surveys have failed to place strict bounds on the total numbers .",
    "one return of the lisa mission will be to place limits on the populations by measuring the galactic background median levels and the number of bright sources from each population .",
    "while the overall level for the galactic background level is partially influenced by the total number of systems , the background level is also dictated by the component masses via equation  . by comparing our hbw based simulations to the population synthesis approach of @xcite , we have found that relatively small changes in the component masses can lead to significant changes in the background levels .",
    "current uncertainties in the true mass distributions arise form a lack a observational data and a theoretical understanding of mass transferring stages during formation .",
    "the nyz white dwarf binaries are typically composed of two light components , @xmath110 , whereas the hbw white dwarf binaries are typically composed of one light component and one heavy component , @xmath111 .",
    "this results in the hbw systems having mean chirp masses , @xmath112 , almost a factor of two higher than the nyz systems .",
    "since the amplitude of signals scales as @xmath113 , the difference in component masses translates into a factor of @xmath114 increase in the hbw background relative to the nyz background for the same source density .",
    "it is an interesting numerical coincidence that the 10% reduction in source density proposed by hbw yields a @xmath115 reduction in the amplitude of the background , resulting in a background level comparable to the nyz model . despite this fortuitous cancellation ,",
    "the hbw 10% and the nyz models yield different confusion noise estimates due to the reduced number of sources in the hbw 10% model .",
    "the period distributions will also impart a noticeable change in the background . if , for example , there is a mechanism that suppresses low period white dwarfs , the values in table  [ tab : removed_types ] and figure  [ fig : outlier_distances ] would change .",

    "our calculation generalizes the expression derived by @xcite to allow for arbitrary observation times , chirping sources , and the effect of the instrument transfer functions .",
    "the first step in the calculation relies on the fact that the functions @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 owe their time variation to the orbital motion of the detector .",
