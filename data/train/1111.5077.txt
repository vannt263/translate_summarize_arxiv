    "the concept of carnot efficiency is of paramount importance in thermodynamics , since the carnot cycle is the most efficient heat engine cycle allowed by physical laws .",
    "when the thermodynamic second law states that not all the supplied heat is applied to producing work , the carnot efficiency presents the limiting value on the fraction of the heat which can be so used . although the quasistatic carnot cycle has the highest efficiency , it outputs zero power because it takes infinite time to output a finite amount of work .",
    "by contrast , curzon and ahlborn @xcite considered a finite - time carnot cycle under the assumption of endoreversibility that irreversible processes occur only through these heat exchanges , they obtained the efficiency @xmath7 at maximum power output as @xmath8 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the temperatures of the hot and cold heat reservoirs , respectively .",
    "the curzon - ahlborn ( ca ) paper has triggered the development of research into finite time thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "the above @xmath7 is usually called the ca efficiency , describing the efficiency of several engine models @xcite and of actual thermal plants @xcite very well .",
    "the ca efficiency has been found to be a universal result in the case of the low , asymmetric dissipation , by optimizing power output with respect to time allocation when time durations in adiabats and nonadiabatic phenomenon were ignored @xcite .",
    "great efforts have been devoted to the study of quantum heat engines @xcite , beginning with the concept of quantum heat engine introduced by scovil and schulz - dubois @xcite .",
    "quantum heat engines differ from classical counterparts mainly in the following three respects : ( i ) the working substance is composed of quantum matter such as spin systems @xcite , harmonic oscillator systems @xcite , two - level or multilevel systems @xcite , cavity quantum electrodynamics systems @xcite , _",
    "etc_. ( ii ) the state of the system is depicted by a quantum - mechanical operator , and the thermodynamic observables are associated with the expectation of values of operators @xcite .",
    "( iii ) quantum equations of motion are used to describe the time evolution of the observables in quantum heat engines , which can avoid using phenomenological heat transfer laws @xcite .",
    "the previous literature discussed the heat engine models in the sudden limit in which the adiabatic process is a spontaneous switching and thus the time allocation on adiabats is negligible @xcite .",
    "thus it is significant to study more general models in which the  adiabatic \" process ( we take the two corresponding processes as two quantum  adiabats \" throughout the paper ) takes finite time as well become nonadiabatic @xcite . during a quantum adiabatic process",
    ", the variation of the eigenspectrum ( quantum state ) of the system must be so slow that the quantum adiabatic theorem @xcite can apply .",
    "otherwise , nonadiabatic dissipation ( e.g. , inner friction @xcite ) occurs because of rapid change in the energy level structure of the quantum system .",
    "particularly nonadiabatic dissipation has been found to have a profound influence on the performance of quantum heat engines @xcite . including nonadiabatic dissipation is therefore essential for more realistic models of quantum heat engines .    in this paper , we study the efficiency at maximum power output of qces performing finite time cycles , in which the time of any adiabat and nonadiabatic dissipation are considered .",
    "we assume that the external parameter affecting the energy spectrum varies at a small but fixed speed which , however , may not be slow enough and thus to cause nonadiabatic phenomenon .",
    "we derive the cycle period that consists of times spent both on the two quantum isotherms and on the two quantum adiabats .",
    "we show that the efficiency at maximum power output converges to an upper and a lower bound in the limits of extremely asymmetric dissipation .",
    "based on the low - dissipation assumption that the irreversible entropy production in a thermodynamic process is inversely proportional to the time required to complete that process , our approach similar to that of the classical thermodynamics predicts that the ca efficiency turns out to be an exact and universal property for qces operating under the conditions that the dissipation is symmetric and the time allocation between the adiabats and the contact time with the reservoir satisfy a certain relation .",
    "we consider a quantum system whose schrdinger s equation is given by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the hamiltonian of the system , its @xmath13th eigenstate and eigenenergy , respectively .",
    "the internal energy @xmath14 reads @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the mean occupation probability of the @xmath13th eigenstate and obeys the canonical distribution @xmath17 in equilibrium , with the canonical partition function @xmath18 .",
    "derivation of @xmath14 leads to the first quantum thermodynamic law @xmath19 .",
    "analogous to the classical thermodynamic first law , the first law of thermodynamics in quantum - mechanical systems is @xcite @xmath20 , in which @xmath21 and @xmath22 depict the heat exchange and work done , respectively , during a thermodynamic process .",
    "note that @xmath23 is associated with the heat exchange because @xmath24 with the entropy @xmath25 . motivated by the definition of the generalized force @xmath26 for a classical system ,",
    "we define analogously the force for a quantum system as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the external parameter ( generalized coordinate corresponding to the force @xmath26 ) @xcite . here",
    "the force @xmath26 and generalized coordinate @xmath28 are state variables @xcite and quantum versions of the classical pressure @xmath29 and volume @xmath30 , respectively .     and force @xmath31 ( a ) and of the temperature @xmath32 and entropy @xmath33 ( b )",

    "when the carnot cycle is reversible , the system couples to the heat reservoir for a sufficiently long time until the system remains infinitesimally close to equilibrium all along the cycle , and in order for the adiabatic theory to remain valid , the time scale of the change of the quantum state must be much larger than that of the dynamical one , @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "for the reversible cycle where @xmath49 and @xmath50 , we recover the carnot efficiency @xmath3 , which is independent of the properties of the quantum working substance .",
    "we denote by @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) the time durations during which the system is coupled to the hot ( cold ) reservoir along a cycle . in the branch @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) , the working substance is decoupled from the hot ( cold ) reservoir , and the entropy changes from @xmath55 to @xmath56 ( @xmath57 to @xmath58 ) during a period @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) , as shown in fig .",

    "under such a circumstance , the thermodynamic quantities of the system@xmath63 in particular the entropy@xmath63are well defined at these instants . during the processes @xmath53 and @xmath54 , the rapid change ( compared with time scale , @xmath64 ) in the energy level structure of the system results in quantum nonadiabatic phenomenon",
    "we emphasize that in any quantum thermodynamic process in which the low dissipation exists the system relaxation is assumed to be fast compared to the time of the process @xcite . during a quantum isothermal ( adiabatic ) process , the entropy production caused by weak dissipation can be written as @xmath65 or @xmath66 ( @xmath67 or @xmath68 ) , since the reversible regime is approached in the infinite time durations . thus , the real heat exchanges @xmath44 and @xmath45 are @xmath69 and @xmath70 , with @xmath71|-(\\frac{{\\sigma_a}}{t_{23}}+\\frac{{\\sigma_a}}{t_{41}})$ ] .",
    "according to the first law of the thermodynamics , the work @xmath72 per cycle is determined by @xmath73 let @xmath74 and @xmath75 be the speed of the change of @xmath28 and the cycle period , respectively .",
