    "our understanding of the origin of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) has advanced rapidly in recent years since the first x - ray @xcite , optical @xcite and radio @xcite afterglows were discovered .",
    "we now know that a grb represents the quick ( @xmath8s ) release of a large amount of energy  about @xmath9erg , when corrected for jet collimation @xcite .",
    "the prompt @xmath0-ray emission is usually attributed to internal shocks due to variability within the ultra - relativistic outflow ( with a lorentz factor @xmath10 ) , while the afterglow is from a strong relativistic shock that is driven into the external medium as it decelerates the ejecta ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "the afterglow emission is predominantly synchrotron radiation , and its spectral and temporal evolution @xcite are governed by such factors as the structure and dynamical evolution of the relativistic jet ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the environment ( e.g. , constant density versus a wind - like density profile ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which are not well constrained .",
    "grb  030329 , discovered by hete-2 @xcite , and localized rapidly in the optical bands by peterson & price ( 2003 ) represents a unique opportunity for vlbi observations . at a redshift of @xmath11 @xcite",
    "this is the second nearest cosmological burst in the northern sky detected to date ( only grb  060218 is nearer at a redshift @xmath12 , * ? ? ?",
    "observation with the vla show the grb030329  radio afterglow to be the brightest detected to date , with a maximum flux density of 55 mjy at 43 ghz one week after the burst @xcite .",
    "most vlba studies so far have been restricted to rather distant grbs ( @xmath13 ) . while these observations have proved to be invaluable in studying the flux evolution of the afterglow and providing accurate positions ( in one case localizing the grb within 0.3 kpc of the center of its radio host galaxy ;",
    "* ) , in all cases the afterglow faded before it could be resolved by the vlba . in the case of grb",
    "030329 we have an exceptional instance of a radio afterglow near and bright enough that it can be resolved with vlbi .",
    "its exceptional brightness enables the radio afterglow to be studied for much longer times than has been typical .    the vlba campaign on grb",
    "030329 @xcite resolved the afterglow image and showed an increase in its diameter from @xmath14as at @xmath15days after the burst to @xmath16as at @xmath17days .",
    "only slow growth was seen out to @xmath18days when the diameter was measured to be @xmath19as , possibly indicating a transition to non - relativistic expansion . here",
    "we present very late time observations of grb 030329 that were performed at @xmath20days after the burst with the goal of differentiating between afterglow models , and constraining the jet structure and dynamics as well as the environment .",
    "such observations can also test the hypothesis of a double - sided jet , which would imply a significant contribution from the counter - jet as the flow becomes sub - relativistic at late times .    assuming a @xmath21 cosmology with @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the angular - diameter distance of grb030329  at @xmath11 is @xmath25mpc , and 1 milliarcsec corresponds to 2.85 pc .",
    "late time observations require high sensitivity to detect the fading afterglow . to achieve this high sensitivity we employed the largest aperture radio telescopes available , and used a bandwidth of @xmath26mhz in two circular polarizations .",
    "the vlbi observations were taken at @xmath27ghz on 2005 june 12 , @xmath28days after the burst , with a global array including the @xmath29 m green bank telescope ( gbt ) of the nrao , the effelsberg @xmath29 m telescopem telescope at effelsberg is operated by the max - planck - institut fr radioastronomie in bonn . ] , the @xmath30 m arecibo telescope , the westerbork ( wsrt ) tied array , and the @xmath31 m markii telescope of jodrell bank ( replaced from the initially scheduled lovell telescope due to the fast source - switching phase - reference schedule ) . in all , the combined effective collecting area is @xmath32 .",
    "the on - source time on grb  030329 was @xmath33hr for all telescopes except for arecibo ( @xmath34hr ) .",
    "data were recorded at @xmath35 and 2-bit sampling at all stations except for green bank , where data were recorded at @xmath36 and 1-bit sampling .",
    "the correlator saw the green bank data as 2-bit data , with the magnitude bit always set to high .",
    "the post - correlation 2-bit van vleck correction thereafter processed the data as usual .",
    "the observations were correlated at the joint institute for vlbi in europe ( jive ) .",
    "the nearby ( 0.8@xmath37 ) source j1048 + 2115 was used as the phase - reference calibrator , and was observed regularly in a cycle of 2 minutes on the target and 1 minute on the calibrator . since j1048 + 2115 is not tied to the international celestial reference frame ( icrf ) , the icrf source j1051 + 2119 was observed every 30 minutes .",
    "this allowed an accurate determination of the position of the phase - reference source and subsequently the target .",
    "self - calibration solutions for the amplitude were transferred from the stronger j1051 + 2119 calibrator , which corrected for a large amplitude offset affecting all the left hand circular polarization ifs of the markii telescope . in proposing these observations , we aimed for a theoretical noise of around 6 @xmath38jy / beam .",
    "however , a number of factors resulted in a decreased sensitivity in our final map .",
    "these factors includes the replacement of lovell with the smaller markii telescope , and missing or bad data . as a result",
    ", a noise of 15 @xmath38jy / beam is reached in the final image .",
    "multi - frequency vla observations of grb030329  have been presented @xcite between @xmath39day and @xmath39yr after the burst . here",
    "we present vla observations at 5ghz taken from the nrao archive between 380 and 740 days after the burst ( see table 1 for more details ) .",
    "the vla data were reduced in aips following standard procedures @xcite .",
    "the nearby ( 1.6@xmath37 separation ) calibrator j1051 + 213 was used to determine the complex antenna gains .",
    "absolute flux density calibration was tied to short observations of 3c286 .    using this vla data in combination with published wsrt data @xcite , we find that the fall in flux densities from day 59 to day 806 ( fig .  1 ) are well described by a power law , @xmath40 , with a slope @xmath41 . in the end of 2009",
    ", the data recording rate of the vlba is planned to increase to @xmath42 compared to its current limit of @xmath43 .",
    "the inclusion of the vlba at this recording rate , as well as the large antennas used for this experiment , should provide an increase in sensitivity by a factor @xmath44 , or a theoretical rms noise of @xmath45jy . assuming that grb030329  continues to fade in the same way",
    ", then we expect a flux density in the end of 2009 ( 6.6 years after the burst ) of @xmath46jy",
    ". thus it should be quite practical to follow the growth of grb030329  for at least another 3 - 5 years .",
    "we fit a symmetric , two - dimensional circular gaussian to the measured visibilities on grb030329  and find a full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) size of @xmath1mas . as in @xcite the error on the size is estimated from signal - to - noise ratios and from monte - carlo simulations of the data using identical ( @xmath47,@xmath48 ) coverage , similar noise properties , and a gaussian component of known size added .",
    "the standard deviation of the recovered sizes , model - fitted in the same way as we treat the observations , was found to be @xmath49mas . given two similar estimates of the error , we adopt the more conservative limit of 0.09 mas based on signal - to - noise ratios and the resolution of the observations .",
    "we also obtain a position for grb030329  of r.a .",
    "10@xmath5044@xmath5149.95957@xmath52 and dec .",
    "21@xmath373117.4375  with an uncertainty of @xmath53mas in each coordinate .",
    "the entire history of expansion for grb030329  is shown in fig .",
    "[ growth ] .",
    "the first measurement at 15 days comes from a model - dependent estimate of the quenching of the scintillation @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties on this size estimate are large due to the dependence of the measurement on estimated properties of the interstellar medium along this particular line - of - sight .",
    "furthermore , a limb - brightened image has a smaller effective area ( similar to a thin ring ) compared to a uniform image of the same diameter .",
    "this reduces the effective number of regions within the image with independent brightness variations for a given image diameter .",
    "thus , in a limb - brightened image ( as expected here ) , the image diameter might be under - estimated by a factor larger than that for the fit to a circular gaussian that is used in the other epochs ( see discussion below eq .  [ beta_app_av ] ) , thus potentially causing a systematic under - estimate of the source size at @xmath54days , compared to the other epochs that are shown in fig .",
    "[ growth ] .",
    "our directly measured size of @xmath1mas at @xmath28days is a factor of @xmath55 larger than the size of @xmath56mas measured at @xmath57days @xcite , which was quite close to the size of @xmath58mas measured at @xmath59days @xcite .",
    "we consider the possibility of no expansion between days 217 and 806 , which at a first look at fig .",
    "[ growth ] might be a plausibility .",
    "however , the points at 217 and 806 days are separated by @xmath60 , and the edges of the @xmath61 regions just touch each other . at the other extreme",
    ", the size could have changed with a factor 4.6 . in this case",
    ", the slope will be inconsistent with the earlier point at day 84 , unless the source increased its expansion speed or shrank in size .",
    "we find this implausible , and that an expansion equal to ( or slower than ) a factor of @xmath55 is more likely .",
    "adopting measured size increase of a factor of @xmath55 , this implies a continued growth of the image size , and confirms a gradual decrease in its apparent expansion speed , @xmath62 . in fig .",
    "3 we show the decline of @xmath63 with time , calculated from the measured sizes using @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the angular and physical radius of the image , respectively , and @xmath67 is the proper distance to the source .",
    "we note that similar to arguments for no expansion in fig .",
    "2 , it could be argued that the apparent expansion speed ( fig .",
    "3 ) at later times is constant .",
    "this would mean that the source size grows linearly with time ( i.e.  a factor of 3.7 growth between day 217 and 806 ) .",
    "as mentioned above , this type of growth requires a rather strange behavior given the point at day 84 .",
    "thus , a decrease in the apparent expansion speed seems more reasonable .",
    "the values for the apparent size depend somewhat upon the intrinsic surface brightness profile , which for circular gaussian , a uniform disk , and a ring , vary roughly as 1:1.6:1.1 @xcite . in practice ,",
    "the image is limb - brightened @xcite , and perhaps slightly closer to a thin ring than to a uniform disk , suggesting a correction factor of @xmath68 .",
    "this correction factor might change with time , since the surface brightness profile within the afterglow image is expected to change across the non - relativistic transition , and possibly also during the post - jet break relativistic stage .",
    "however , the afterglow image during both of these stages has not been studied yet in sufficient detail to provide a reliable description of the exact temporal evolution of this correction factor . at any rate , this effect is expected to be fairly mild , and smaller than the factor of @xmath55 growth in the image size between @xmath57days and @xmath28days .    taking this correction factor into account , we find @xmath69 after @xmath28days , i.e. that the current expansion velocity ( which is expected to be somewhat smaller than the average value @xmath70 ) is only mildly relativistic , while at earlier times it was considerably higher and more relativistic , as implied by the value of @xmath71 after @xmath31days .",
    "the non - relativistic transition occurs when @xmath72 , i.e. when @xmath73 , the exact value depending on the detailed expansion history @xcite .",
    "this suggests a non - relativistic transition time of about @xmath74yr .",
    "based on a joint temporal and spectral fit to the light curve , @xcite find @xmath75days , and @xcite use simultaneous radio , millimeter and optical observations to derive model - dependent non - relativistic transition times of @xmath76 and @xmath77days .",
    "moreover , multi - frequency radio data presented by @xcite is fitted with a @xmath78days .",
    "all these transition times are condsiderably shorter than our estimate . in principle",
    "their models could be refined using the direct size estimates presented here to better constrain the energetics of the burst and other physical parameters of the models .",
    "radio re - brightening of grb030329  has been predicted by @xcite as the counter jet becomes non - relativistic and its emission is no longer strongly beamed away from us .",
    "@xcite estimated a level of @xmath79mjy at @xmath54ghz , @xmath80yr after the burst , due to this effect . the actual flux density around that time , however , was @xmath81 times lower than their prediction ( @xmath82mjy at @xmath83ghz after @xmath84days , with @xmath85 in the radio , between the two frequencies , implying @xmath86mjy at @xmath54ghz ) .",
    "more importantly , we find that the late time @xmath87ghz light curve , from @xmath88days and up to @xmath28days , is consistent with a single power law decay of @xmath89 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , which implies that up to @xmath90days after grb030329  there is still no significant contribution to the observed flux from the counter jet .",
    "light travel effects might cause the contribution from the counter jet to become significant at a somewhat later time , up to a factor of several after @xmath91 when @xmath72 , i.e. up to several years after the burst ( this effect was taken into account by * ? ? ?",
    "* but they estimated a somewhat lower value for @xmath91 of @xmath92days ) . alternatively ,",
    "if the counter jet encounters a somewhat lower external density than the forward jet , it would become non - relativistic at a later lab frame time , and light travel effects would cause its contribution to the observed flux density to become significant at an even later time ( as well as being intrinsically less luminous than the forward jet at the same radius ) .",
    "if such a re - brightening ( or at least a significantly shallower flux decay ) eventually occurs within the next several years , it may enable measurement of the image size for a longer time .    fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] demonstrates how the measured evolution of the image size for grb030329  compares with the predictions of different theoretical models .",
    "the data constrain the external density profile at radii @xmath93 cm , and favor a uniform density external medium ( @xmath94 with @xmath95 ) over a stellar wind environment ( @xmath96 , as expected for a massive star progenitor ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although it is hard to rule out the latter due to the sizeable errors on the source size , and the theoretical uncertainty in the jet structure and dynamics .",
    "the degree of lateral spreading of the jet is harder to constrain , since its effect on the evolution of the observed image size around the times when it was measured is somewhat smaller than that of the external density profile ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .      solving for proper motion using all the vlbi observations to date",
    ", we derive @xmath97 mas yr@xmath98 and @xmath99 mas yr@xmath98 , or an angular displacement over @xmath28days of @xmath100mas ( fig .  5 ) .",
    "these observations are consistent with those reported by @xcite , and impose an even stronger limit on the proper motion .",
    "the implied limit on the proper motion in the plane of the sky is @xmath101mas ( corresponding to @xmath102pc ) in @xmath103days , or @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "our new upper limits on the proper motion are about a factor of 2 better than previous limits .",
    "the proper motion of the flux centroid is constrained to be less than the current diameter of the image , which is consistent with the expectations for a narrow double sided jet , is expected to be @xmath106 , which is a factor of @xmath107 larger than the expected maximal angular displacement of the flux centroid . ] where the maximal angular displacement of the flux centroid is @xmath108 and is obtained around @xmath91 , where @xmath109 @xcite , since for grb030329the viewing angle is within the jet , @xmath110 .",
    "this consistency is independent of the value of the jet initial half - opening angle , @xmath111 , which is somewhat controversial @xcite .",
    "we present measurements of the @xmath27ghz flux density and size of the radio afterglow from grb030329  over a period of 2.2 years .",
    "these observations clearly demonstrate that the expansion velocity has slowed down over time , with a transition to the non - relativistic regime at @xmath1121 yr .",
    "the evolution of the afterglow image size favors a uniform external density over a wind - like stratified external medium ( at @xmath5 cm ) , although the data still do not enable to conclusively rule out a wind - like density profile ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "we also present a tight upper limit on the apparent motion of the flux centroid ( @xmath104 , a factor of 2 better than previous limits ) , which are consistent with the predictions of standard afterglow theory .",
    "although grb  030329 has faded considerably , it is likely that vlbi observations will continue to be useful for determining expansion size estimates in the future . with",
    "vlbi recording rates expected to increase to @xmath42 over the next few years , thermal noise levels of the vlba at 5ghz should decrease to @xmath113jy , and arrays of larger antennas , such as the one used in this work , will reach theoretical thermal noise levels of @xmath45jy .",
    "this anticipated increase in vlbi capability should keep pace with the flux density of grb  030329 for the next few years .",
    "a rebrightening , or at least a significantly shallower flux decay , is expected within the next several years , as the counter jet begins to significantly contribute to the observed flux .",
    "further vlbi observations should improve constraints on the density profile of the external medium into which the afterglow shock is expanding , and should eventually reveal the shape of the afterglow .",
