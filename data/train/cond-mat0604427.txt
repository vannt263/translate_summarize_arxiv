    "physical quantities computed included the leading contribution to the dynamical magnetic susceptibility at wave numbers near the helical pitch wave number , and the noninteracting single - particle green function in the ordered phase .",
    "results for the helimagnon consistent with i were obtained in ref .  .",
    "in the present paper we use the results of i to determine some of the thermodynamic and transport properties of the helical magnetic state .",
    "in particular we will calculate the effects of the magnetic fluctuations in the ordered phase on the specific heat coefficient and on the electrical resistivity to first order in these fluctuations .",
    "we will see that the magnetic soft modes lead to nonanalytic corrections to the standard fermi - liquid theory results . specifically , we find that the specific heat coefficient @xmath14 has a contribution linear in the temperature @xmath15 , whereas fermi - liquid theory gives a leading correction to the constant pauli value that is proportional to @xmath16 .",
