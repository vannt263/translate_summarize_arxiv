    "in digital communication systems , synchronization is an essential requirement to establish and maintain a connection between a transmitter and a receiver .",
    "analytical approaches to the synchronization acquisition process and methods for the construction of sequences with the best aperiodic autocorrelation properties have been the subject of numerous analyses in the digital transmission .",
    "the historical engineering approach started with the introduction of bifix .",
    "it denotes a subsequence that is both a prefix and suffix of a longer observed sequence .",
    "rather than to the bifix , much attention has been devoted to a bifix - indicator , an indicator function implying the existence of the bifix @xcite .",
    "such indicators were shown to be without equal in performing various statistical analysis , mainly concerning the search process @xcite    however , an analytical study of simultaneous search for a set of sequences urged the invention of cross - bifix indicators @xcite and , accordingly , turned attention to the sets of sequences which avoid cross - bifixes , called cross - bifix - free sets .",
    "in @xcite , the author analyzes some properties of binary words that form a cross - bifix - free set , in particular , a general constructing method called the kernel method is presented .",
    "this approach leads to sets @xmath0 of cross - bifix - free binary words , of fixed length @xmath1 , having cardinality @xmath2 for @xmath3 respectively .",
    "this sequence forms a fibonacci progression and satisfies the recurrence relation @xmath4 with @xmath5 and @xmath6 .    the problem of determining cross - bifix - free sets is also related to several other scientific applications , for instance in multiaccess systems , pattern matching and automata theory .",
    "the aim of this paper is to introduce a method for the generation of sets of cross - bifix - free binary words of fixed length based upon the study of lattice paths on the cartesian plane .",
    "this approach enables us to obtain cross - bifix - free sets having greater cardinality than the ones presented in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give some basic definitions and notation related to the notions of bifix - free word and cross - bifix - free set . in section 3",
    "we propose a method to construct particular sets of cross - bifix - free binary words of fixed length @xmath1 related to the parity of @xmath1 .",
