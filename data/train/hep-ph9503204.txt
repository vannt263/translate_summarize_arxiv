    "in addition to the established three generations of quarks in the standard model ( sm ) , the possible existence of exotic singlet quarks ( whose left and right chiral components are both singlets with respect to the su(2 ) weak isospin gauge group ) has been raised in various contexts .",
    "it was once questioned whether the @xmath10 quark might be such a singlet , with no doublet partner @xmath13@xcite .",
    "one charge @xmath14 singlet quark appears naturally in each 27-plet fermion generation of @xmath12 grand unification theories ( guts ) @xcite .",
    "charge @xmath15 singlet quarks have been variously motivated , as part of a new mass mechanism for top quarks @xcite or as part of a new supersymmetric gauge model with natural baryon - number conservation@xcite .",
    "if they exist , both kinds of singlet quarks can be produced via their strong and electroweak gauge couplings ; mixing with standard quarks then allows the mixed mass eigenstates to decay via charged currents ( cc ) or neutral currents ( nc ) to lighter quarks @xmath16 plus @xmath17 or @xmath18 @xcite , and also via yukawa couplings to @xmath16 plus higgs bosons @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "singlet quark production and decay can therefore give characteristic new signals and modifications of old signals , discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "possible indirect consequences of singlet - quark mixing for flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) , flavor - diagonal neutral currents ( fdnc ) and cp violation have also been considered   @xcite    in the present paper we address some further aspects of singlet quark physics .",
    "we first collect and update the direct and indirect constraints on masses and singlet - doublet mixing from present data , illustrating possible effects on @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays and on cp asymmetries in neutral @xmath20 decays .",
    "we then analyse the impact of @xmath21 and @xmath22 singlet quarks on the renormalization group equations ( rge ) , on the unification and perturbativity of gauge and yukawa couplings , and on the exotic matter multiplets in gut scenarios .",
    "section ii introduces our notation and lists general basic properties of singlet quark couplings and mixings with sm quarks .",
    "section iii addresses the @xmath23 mixing matrix , arising when one singlet mixes with three sm quarks , and extracts the full set of unitarity constraints based on present limits on the ckm submatrix .",
    "section iv discusses the constraints implied by the absence of identifiable signals from singlet - quark production and decay at present @xmath24 and @xmath25 colliders .",
    "section v considers tree and box diagram contributions to neutral meson - antimeson oscillations and the indirect constraints on singlet - quark mixing from present data .",
    "section vi addresses indirect constraints from fcnc and fdnc decays , including a new more stringent measurement of @xmath26 and weak bounds from @xmath27 limits ; the topical cases @xmath0 and @xmath1 are discussed here .",
    "the global fdnc constraints are comprehensive enough to have useful repercussions via unitarity , for @xmath3-type singlet mixing .",
    "section vii discusses cp asymmetries in neutral @xmath20 decays , with new illustrations of how @xmath3-type singlet mixing can give dramatic changes from sm expectations .",
    "section viii , our major new contribution , analyses the possible roles of singlet quarks in gut scenarios .",
    "we show that @xmath3-type singlets are most economically introduced in @xmath28 multiplets of @xmath5 , with up to three generations , preserving gauge coupling unification and perturbativity up to the gut scale ; @xmath6-type singlets can arise in @xmath29 multiplets of @xmath5 with at most one light generation .",
    "the presence of extra matter multiplets makes the gauge couplings bigger and two - loop effects potentially more important .",
    "we give the two - loop evolution equations , including the effects of exotic matter multiplets and a possible additional @xmath30 gauge coupling , and show that two - loop effects can threaten not only unification ( where threshold effects may partly compensate ) but also perturbativity and asymptotic freedom of @xmath9 at large scales . in the yukawa sector ,",
    "top - quark fixed - point behaviour is preserved and singlet - quark couplings have infrared fixed points too , but unification of @xmath10 and @xmath11 couplings is not possible in a three - generation @xmath12 model . finally , section ix summarizes our conclusions while appendices a and b contain some technical details .",
    "we shall generally denote singlet quarks by the symbol @xmath31 , and sm quarks by @xmath16 .",
    "more specifically , @xmath32 denotes a generic charge @xmath14 singlet and @xmath33 implies charge @xmath15 .",
    "the weak isospin @xmath34 and hypercharge @xmath35 of the left and right chiral components , characterizing their su(2 ) and u(1 ) gauge couplings , contrast with sm assignments as follows : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the electric charge .",
    "the vector and axial couplings to @xmath18 are @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the weinberg angle .",
    "both sm and singlet quarks are color triplets and have the same couplings to gluons @xmath40 .",
    "hence singlet quarks have pure vector gauge couplings to @xmath41 ( and zero coupling to @xmath17 ) ; they are sometimes called  vector - like \" or more precisely  vector - singlet \" quarks .",
    "they do not contribute to chiral anomalies .",
    "yukawa interactions with higgs fields generate quark masses and mixings .",
    "mixing with conventional quarks provides natural decay channels and is expected at some level , since new quarks are necessarily unstable@xcite .",
    "suppose first , for simplicity , that mass eigenstates @xmath42 arise from the mixing of just one sm quark field @xmath43 with a singlet quark field @xmath44 of the same ( unspecified ) charge . then the sm higgs field @xmath19 can generate a @xmath45h.c . mixing term as well as the usual @xmath46h.c .",
    "mass term . a pure singlet mass term @xmath47h.c .",
    "requires an isosinglet higgs field @xmath48 with vacuum expectation value @xmath49 and coupling @xmath50h.c . ; this field can also generate a @xmath51 term .",
    "we then have the @xmath52 mass matrix @xmath53 where the rows refer to @xmath54 and the columns refer to @xmath55 .",
    "this is diagonalized by independent rotations of @xmath56 and @xmath57 coordinates , giving quark mass eigenstates @xmath16 and @xmath31 : @xmath58 since no singlets have yet been discovered , it is natural to assume that the mixing angles @xmath59 are small and @xmath31 is much heavier than @xmath16 ( at least for @xmath60 ) , with @xmath61 , @xmath62 . then @xmath16 and @xmath31 are dominated by @xmath43 and @xmath44 components , respectively , with @xmath63 .",
    "note that @xmath64 gauge couplings relate exclusively to @xmath65 and hence are controlled by the left - handed mixing angle @xmath66 only .",
    "the heavy mostly - singlet quark @xmath31 can now decay to @xmath67 and @xmath68 via the couplings @xmath69 where @xmath40 is the su(2 ) gauge coupling , @xmath70 and @xmath71 is the combination of light quarks that couple via @xmath17 to @xmath65 . since @xmath72 by assumption , this gives branching fractions in the ratio @xmath73 up to phase space factors  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , if the sm higgs boson is light enough , @xmath31 can also decay to @xmath74 via the coupling @xmath75 hence the higgs decay mode too is scaled by @xmath76 , and the three decay branching fractions are in the ratios  @xcite @xmath77 up to phase space factors that are close to 1 , if @xmath78 .",
    "these ratios can however be altered greatly if this mass ordering does not hold , or if there is large mixing  @xcite",
    ".    in general singlet quarks can mix with all sm quarks of the same charge , requiring a more extended formalism .",
    "we first consider scenarios with just one new singlet quark .    for the case of one charge @xmath79 singlet field , mixing with the three sm fields of this charge , we denote the mass eigenstate by @xmath80 where the first three are identified with the known quarks ( now carrying hitherto unsuspected singlet components ) and @xmath31 is still undiscovered .",
    "we denote by @xmath81 the three orthonormal linear combinations of left chiral components that are su(2)@xmath82 doublet partners of the known @xmath83 fields @xmath84 ; the remaining orthonormal combination @xmath85 is an su(2)@xmath82 singlet , and we can write @xmath86 here the @xmath87 unitary matrix @xmath88 generalizes the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xmath89 .",
    "the top three rows of @xmath88 control the su(2)@xmath82 gauge couplings of @xmath17 and @xmath18 bosons ; the first 3 rows and columns of @xmath88 are precisely @xmath89 .",
    "the submatrix @xmath89 is generally non - unitary .",
    "the @xmath18 couplings to the su(2)@xmath82 left - handed doublet and singlet weak eigenstates @xmath90 are given by @xmath91 hence the fcnc couplings between the mass eigenstates @xmath92 are @xmath93 using the unitarity of @xmath88 .",
    "thus the fcnc coefficients @xmath94 are measures of non - unitarity in @xmath95 .",
    "the corresponding fdnc couplings are @xmath96q_i \\;. \\label{eq : dfdnc}\\ ] ] thus for the standard @xmath97 quarks , mixing with @xmath31 reduces direct left - handed fdnc by a factor @xmath98 and leaves right - handed fdnc unchanged .",
    "hence for @xmath99 , the tree - level widths for cc and fcnc decays to light quarks are @xmath100 if @xmath31 is heavy enough that all the @xmath101 and @xmath102 channels are open and all the phase space factors are @xmath103 , then we can use unitarity to sum over @xmath104 and @xmath105 and obtain the total cc and fcnc decay widths , @xmath106 hence for small mixing ( @xmath107 ) we obtain @xmath108 a result proved earlier for two - quark mixing , modulo phase space factors .",
    "consider now one @xmath83 singlet field mixing with the sm fields of the same charge and denote the mass eigenstates by @xmath109 , identifying the first three with the known quarks .",
    "let @xmath110 be the three orthonormal linear combinations of left chiral components that form su(2)@xmath82 doublets with the known @xmath111 fields @xmath112 , respectively , while the remaining combination @xmath85 is a singlet .",
    "we can then write @xmath113 the first three rows of the unitary matrix @xmath114 control the su(2)@xmath82 couplings of @xmath17 and @xmath18 ; the first three rows and columns of @xmath114 are precisely @xmath95 ( now generally non - unitary ) .",

    "the corresponding fdnc couplings are @xmath121q_i \\;.\\ ] ] for standard @xmath122 quarks , mixing with @xmath31 again reduces left - handed fdnc and leaves right - handed fdnc unchanged .",
    "the decay - width formulas are obtained from eqs.([eq : gccxd])- ( [ eq : gfcncxd ] ) , by substituting @xmath123 and @xmath124 for @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "we here combine the notations of ( b ) and ( c ) above , and define @xmath127 to be three doublet and one singlet @xmath83 fields , while @xmath128 are the corresponding three doublets ( paired with @xmath129 and remaining singlet @xmath130 fields .",
    "neutral - current couplings of @xmath32 and @xmath33 are as in ( b ) and ( c ) above .",
    "charged - current couplings are defined via the matrix @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is diagonal with elements 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 down the diagonal ; @xmath133 generalizes the ckm matrix , its first three rows and columns being simply @xmath89 . for more general",
    "mixing parametrizations , see refs .",
    "when extra quarks are mixed in , unitarity constraints no longer apply to the @xmath134 ckm submatrix . without these constraints ,",
    "the ckm matrix elements lie in the following ranges  @xcite : @xmath135 however these numbers were obtained before the evidence for the top quark at fermilab  @xcite .",
    "the presence of an apparent top quark signal in @xmath10-tagged events at , or even above , the predicted sm rate @xcite , strongly suggests a dominant @xmath136 decay with @xmath137 . with this extra constraint ,",
    "all the off - diagonal elements of the @xmath87 quark mixing matrix @xmath88 ( or @xmath114 ) are necessarily small .",
    "one can then generalize the wolfenstein parameterization @xmath138 by taking for example ( for the @xmath130 case @xmath88 ) @xmath139 here the new parameters @xmath140 are real and @xmath20 is small ( no hierarchy of these elements is imposed here ) .",
    "often it is more convenient to adopt a parameterization in terms of the sines @xmath141 of small angles @xmath142 , setting @xmath143 and neglecting all @xmath144 terms except @xmath145 ( see also ref.@xcite ) : @xmath146 in this parameterization , the fcnc coefficients ( @xmath147 ) are @xmath148 similarly , if this parameterization is applied to @xmath114 in the case of one @xmath22 singlet quark , we have fcnc coefficients ( @xmath149 ) @xmath150    unitarity constraints on the @xmath151 ckm matrix give linear three - term relations that can be expressed graphically as triangle relations in the complex plane ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : quad ] . with @xmath23 mixing ,",
    "they become four - term relations ; e.g. for one @xmath21 singlet , we have @xmath152 or again , @xmath153 for @xmath154 these are expressible as quadrangle conditions in the complex plane .",
    "the first three terms in each case , however , are precisely the three sides of a triangle if ckm unitarity holds ( the most discussed example is eq.([eq : quad1 ] ) with @xmath155 ) .",
    "thus @xmath23 unitarity replaces the ckm triangle relations by quadrangle relations . in eq.([eq : quad1 ] ) the fourth side of the quadrangle is @xmath156 , the fcnc coefficient@xcite . in eq.([eq : quad2 ] ) the fourth side is @xmath157 , that occurs in certain flavor - changing box diagrams ( see below ) .    in the case of one @xmath21 singlet quark , the squares of the elements in each row and column of the @xmath23 unitary matrix @xmath88 sum to unity .",
    "hence the experimental lower bounds on the ckm submatrix elements@xcite shown in eq.([eq : ckmlim ] ) give constraints : @xmath158 also each quadrangle must close , so the exotic fourth side is bounded by the sum of the upper limits of the three conventional ckm sides , giving @xmath159 finally , when eventually we obtain upper bounds on @xmath160 ( @xmath105 ) from other data , unitarity will imply a lower bound on @xmath161 , and hence an upper bound on @xmath162 ; this latter bound will apply equally to each @xmath163 in the summation ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "see section vi(e ) below .",

    ", if there is an excess of top - type events above the sm rate  @xcite , this could be due to @xmath208 production in addition to @xmath203 production @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) a @xmath130 singlet @xmath209 that mixes mostly with @xmath10 and has @xmath210 would decay dominantly via @xmath211 with the @xmath212 mode suppressed , escaping the usual top searches but offering new @xmath18 and @xmath19 signals . if the latter are suppressed ( e.g. , if @xmath213 ) , early cdf limits on the remaining @xmath18 signals imply a bound @xmath214  gev  @xcite .",
    "this scenario gains fresh interest  @xcite from hints of possible excess tagged @xmath18 plus four jet events at the tevatron  @xcite .    to be quantitative about signal expectations with @xmath10-tagging ,",
    "let us consider @xmath209 and @xmath13 to be degenerate ( @xmath215 ) for simplicity , so that they are produced equally .",
    "if @xmath209 is lighter than this , the singlet signal rates will be correspondingly higher .",
    "for the singlet decay we consider two extreme scenarios : ( a )  @xmath216 , so that @xmath217 and ( b )  @xmath218 with small @xmath10-@xmath209 mixing , so that @xmath219 . for @xmath10-tagging efficiency , we assume @xmath220 to be the probability for tagging a single @xmath10-quark ; then the probability for tagging a @xmath221 event is @xmath222 and the probability for tagging a @xmath223 event is @xmath224 .",
    "our discussion is simplified in that we neglect fake tags , assume @xmath10-tags are uncorrelated , and assume 100% acceptance .",
    "then the probabilites for different final state configurations including @xmath10-tagging are @xmath225 summing over @xmath226 channels .",

    "their masses must generally exceed @xmath553 ; higher limits 85 - 131 gev apply in certain particular scenarios ( see section iv ) .",
    "we have collected the available bounds on singlet quark mixing ; some have been updated ; some , such as the @xmath27 and @xmath554 constraints and the unitarity implications of fdnc bounds , have not appeared explicitly before ( see sections iii - vi ) .",
    "the present limits on the @xmath23 mixing matrix elements connecting one new singlet quark to standard quarks may be summarized as follows .",
    "@xmath555 @xmath556 we have discussed possible effects of singlet quarks on @xmath557 decays , and have illustrated how a @xmath6-type singlet could either increase or decrease the sm rate for @xmath0 ( fig.[fig : bsgam ] ) . we have pointed out that small @xmath558 mixing reduces the branching fraction for @xmath559 decays ; in the interesting case @xmath1 , this would worsen the present discrepancy between sm and experiment .",

    "gauge coupling unification in a desert model can be achieved by assuming that split representations exist . in the context of models with singlet quarks ,",

    "an up - type singlet quark is not contained as elegantly in gut models ; it does not appear in the smallest representations , and its role is less clear . as a minimal prescription , it can be introduced by adding one extra light @xmath450 and one @xmath451 representation of @xmath5 that get their mass from an @xmath5 singlet higgs boson ; this implies extra vector - doublet quarks and a vector - singlet charged lepton too , preserving mssm gauge coupling unification with @xmath452 at one loop ( fig.[fig : oneg1h ] ) .",
    "less minimally , it can also be realized in the @xmath447 group with an extra light @xmath563 ( adjoint ) representation ( which decomposes to @xmath564 in an @xmath5 subgroup ) , but this leads to nonperturbative gauge couplings at the gut scale if the entire @xmath565 is required to be light .",
    "two - loop effects are typically small in most gut models , but if one includes extra representations of matter then the evolution of the strong coupling is diminished and it might even increase ( no asymptotic freedom ) toward the gut scale . in a situation where the strong gauge coupling does not evolve at the one - loop level , we find that the two - loop effects become relatively more important and can make gauge coupling unification problematic , e.g. for three complete generations of @xmath12 @xmath468-plet matter .",
    "however one expects the low - energy threshold corrections to be more significant in this case , and ultimately the success of unification depends on the details of the low - energy spectrum .",
    "two - loop effects also threaten perturbativity and asymptotic freedom of @xmath9 ( figs.[fig : oneg1h]-[fig : threeg ] ) .",
