    "let us begin by stating our basic context .",
    "in the light of the current observations , we assume that the current matter content of the universe is well approximated by a dust of density @xmath3 , ( baryonic plus dark mater ) plus a cosmological constant @xmath0 ( @xmath4 ) . in this @xmath0cdm context",
    ", we additionally assume that the universe is modelled by a space - time manifold @xmath5 with a locally ( spatially ) homogeneous and isotropic metric @xmath6 \\,,\\ ] ] where , depending on the spatial curvature @xmath7 , the geometry of the @xmath8space @xmath9 is either euclidean ( @xmath10 ) , spherical ( @xmath11 ) , or hyperbolic ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the metric  ( [ rwmetric ] ) only expresses the principle of spatial homogeneity and isotropy along with the existence of a cosmic time @xmath13 , it does not specify the underlying space - time manifold @xmath14 nor the spatial section @xmath15 , which are often taken to be the ( simply - connected ) spaces : euclidean @xmath16 , spherical @xmath17 , or hyperbolic space @xmath18 .",
    "this has led to a common misconception that the gaussian curvature @xmath7 of @xmath9 is all one needs to determine the topology of the spatial sections @xmath9 .",
    "however , it is a mathematical result that the great majority of constant curvature @xmath8spaces , @xmath9 , are multiply - connected quotient manifolds of the form @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a fixed - point free group of isometries of the corresponding covering space ( see ref .   for details ) .    in the general relativity ( gr )",
    "framework the friedmann written in the form @xmath23 makes apparent that the chief point in the search for the spatial curvature ( and the associated geometry ) is to constrain the total density @xmath24 from observations",
    ". this amounts to determining regions in the parametric planes @xmath25@xmath26 ( or @xmath25@xmath27 ) , which consistently account for the observations , and from which one expects to deduce the geometry of the universe .",
    "now given that the spatial geometry can be probed but its knowledge does does not determine the topology of the @xmath8space @xmath9 , the question arises as to whether the spatial topology is an observable that can be be used to set constraints on the density parameters . @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "an important observational consequence of a observable nontrivial topology@xcite of @xmath9 is the existence of the circles - in - the - sky,@xcite i.e. , pairs of correlated circles with the same fluctuation of temperature distribution @xmath30 will be imprinted on the cmbr anisotropy sky maps  @xcite .",
    "hence , to observationally probe a putative a nontrivial topology of @xmath9 , one ought to examine the full - sky cmbr maps in order to extract the pairs of correlated circles and determine the spatial topology .    here",
    "we briefly illustrate the constraints that a possible detection of a non - trivial spatial topology may place on the cosmological density parameters in the @xmath0cdm , i.e. , by assuming a poincar dodecahedral ( pds ) topology as a circles - in - the - sky observable spatial topology we reanalyze the type ia supernovae constraints on the density parameter plane @xmath1  ",
    "@xmath31 that arise from _ gold _ set of 157 sne ia , as compiled by riess _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , and show that a circles - in - the - sky detection of the pds topology gives rise to important additional constraints on parameters of this plane .",
    "using the three - year data the wmap team@xcite reports six different values for the total density @xmath32 ranging from a very nearly flat @xmath33 to positively curved @xmath34 depending on the combination of data set used to resolve the geometrical degeneracy .",
    "the poincar dodecahedral space ( pds ) , @xmath35 , fits both this latter density and the suppression of power of the low multipoles observed by the wmap team . , where @xmath36 is the binary octahedral group , also explain these data analysis.@xcite ] attempts to find antipodal or nearly - antipodal",
    "circles - in - the - sky in the wmap data have failed  @xcite . on the other hand , hints of matching circles@xcite in first year",
    "ilc wmap maps have be found , but although a second group has confirmed the circles,@xcite they have also shown that the circle detection lies below the false positive threshold.@xcite .",
    "even if one adopts the result that pairs of antipodal ( or nearly antipodal ) circles of radius @xmath37 are undetectable in the current cmbr maps the question arises as to whether the circles are not there or are simply hidden or destroyed by various sources of contamination or even due to the angular resolution of the current cmbr maps.@xcite the answer to these questions requires great care , among other things , because the level of contamination depends on both the choice of the cosmological models ( parameters ) and on the topology@xcite .",
    "results so far remain non - conclusive , i.e. , one group finds their negative outcome to be robust for globally homogeneous topologies , including the dodecahedral space , in spite of contamination@xcite , while another group finds the contamination strong enough to hide the possible correlated circles in the current cmbr maps.@xcite thus , it is conceivable that the correlated circles may have been overlooked in the cmbr sky maps searches .     a schematic illustration of two antipodal matching circles in the lss.,width=170,height=170 ]    in the poincar dodecahedral space @xmath38 , which we shall assume here , the pairs of matching circles are necessarily antipodal as shown in fig .",
    "[ cinthesky1 ] .",
    "clearly the distance between the centers of each pair of the correlated circles is twice the injectivity radius of the smallest sphere inscribable @xmath38 . a straightforward use of trigonometric relations for the right - angled spherical triangle shown in fig .  [ cinthesky1 ]",

    "equation  ( [ chilss ] ) makes apparent that @xmath45 depends on the cosmological scenario , which we have taken to be @xmath0cdm .",
    "equation  ( [ chilss ] ) give the relation between the angular radius @xmath48 and the parameters of the @xmath0cdm model , and thus can be used to set constraints on these parameters . for a detailed analysis of topological constraints in the context of other models and data sets ,",
    "including braneworld inspired models , we refer the readers to refs .",
    "and refs .  .",
    "to illustrate the role of the cosmic topology in constraining the density parameter in the context of @xmath0cdm model , we consider the @xmath38 spatial topology , and assume the angular radius @xmath49 and uncertainty @xmath50 .",
    "figure  [ lcdm_p0 ] shows the results of our joint sne ia gold sample@xcite plus cosmic topology analysis .",
    "there we display the confidence regions in the parametric plane @xmath51@xmath52 and also the regions from the conventional analysis .",
    "the comparison between these regions makes clear that the effect of the @xmath38 topology is to reduce considerably the area corresponding to the confidence intervals in the parametric plane as well as to break degeneracies arising from the current sne ia measurements .",
