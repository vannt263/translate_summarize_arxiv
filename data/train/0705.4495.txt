    "brane world models and their phenomenology have been widely discussed in the last years .",
    "one of the most interesting brane world models is the randall - sundrum model with two branes ,  the rs1 model @xcite .",
    "this model solves the hierarchy problem due to the warp factor in the metric and predicts an interesting new physics in the @xmath0 range of energies .",
    "most of the brane world models with one compact extra dimension and thin branes with tension demand the existence of at least two branes . at the same time",
    "the matter located on the brane , which is not `` our ''  brane , can strongly affect the world located on `` our''brane . for the case of the rs1 model it was shown in @xcite .",
    "so it would be quite interesting to find out , whether it is possible to construct a model with only one tensionful brane in a compact extra dimension , admitting a solution to the hierarchy problem in the way analogous to that proposed in @xcite .",
    "a characteristic feature of models with single brane is the presence of at least one tachyonic mode in the perturbative linearized theory @xcite . at the same time",
    "the linearized theory , as well as the five - dimensional effective action describing a brane world model , is valid for the energy range of the order of the fundamental energy scale of the theory , defined by the five - dimensional gravity ( we suppose that this scale is of the order of @xmath1 ) .",
    "thus , if the masses of the tachyonic modes are far beyond the energy range of its applicability , their influence on the theory can not be accessed in the linear approximation , and one needs to consider the nonlinear effects .",
    "some solutions with single brane in a compact extra dimension , interesting from the cosmological point of view , were obtained in @xcite .",
    "but the energy - momentum tensors used for obtaining these solution are `` phenomenological '' , i.e. they are added to the action `` by hand '' .    here",
    "we present a model describing the scalar field minimally coupled to gravity in a five - dimensional space - time , admitting the existence of a single brane quite naturally and being of interest from the point of view of the hierarchy problem .",
    "moreover , the size of the extra dimension in this model can be easily stabilized .",
    "thus , the model appears to be devoid of the main flaw of the original randall - sundrum model ",
    "the existence of the massless scalar mode , called the radion , which arises due to the fluctuations of the branes with respect to each other and whose interactions contradict the existing experimental data .",
    "we argue that the stabilization of the size of extra dimension is made in the same way as in @xcite .",
    "this method is free from the main disadvantage of the approach proposed in @xcite , where the backreaction of the scalar field on the background metric is not taken into account .",
    "there is only one tachyonic mode in the model with the mass of the order of the four - dimensional planck mass @xmath2 , thus lying far beyond the applicability range of the theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we present the background solution and the method of its stabilization . in section",
    "3 we obtain gauge conditions and equations of motion for linearized gravity in the model . in section  4",
    "we consider the tensor modes and obtain an expression for the four - dimensional planck mass on the brane in terms of the model parameters . in section  5",
    "we consider the scalar sector of the theory , discuss the stability of the model and obtain the estimates for the mass of the lowest scalar mode and its coupling constant to matter on the brane . and finally , we discuss the obtained results .",
    "let us denote the coordinates in five - dimensional space - time @xmath3 by @xmath4 , @xmath5 , the coordinate @xmath6 parametrizing the fifth dimension with identified points @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the brane is located at the point @xmath9 .",
    "the action of stabilized brane world model can be written as @xmath10 -\\int_{y = l}d^{4}x\\sqrt{-\\tilde g}\\lambda(\\phi),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath11 is a bulk scalar field potential and @xmath12 is the brane scalar field potential , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 denotes the metric induced on the brane .",
    "the signature of the metric @xmath15 is chosen to be @xmath16 .",
    "the standard ansatz for the metric and the scalar field , which preserves the poincar invariance in any four - dimensional subspace @xmath17 , looks like @xmath18 @xmath19 denoting the flat minkowski metric .",
    "if one substitutes this ansatz into the equations corresponding to action ( [ actiondw ] ) , one gets a rather complicated system of nonlinear differential equations for functions @xmath20 : @xmath21 here and below @xmath22 .",
    "an interesting conclusion following from these equations is that the relation @xmath23 holds in the bulk for any potential @xmath11 , and thus @xmath24 in the bulk .",
    "this inequality was also obtained in @xcite from the weaker energy condition .",
    "to find an analytic solution to this system we will use the results of @xcite . let us consider a special class of potentials , which can be represented as @xmath25 let us also suppose that @xmath26 in this case the scalar field potential takes a simple polynomial form @xmath27 and the corresponding continuous background solution can be easily found ( with the help of the procedure described in @xcite ) : @xmath28 the additive constant in the solution for @xmath29 is chosen in such a way that the coordinates @xmath30 are galilean on the brane ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "we will refer all the energy parameters , which appear in the theory , to this galilean coordinate system on the brane .    in order the equations of motion be valid on the brane too , one needs to finetune the brane potential @xmath12 .",
    "we choose @xmath31 in this case the brane appears to be of the bps type .",
    "the size of the extra dimension is not defined by the solution yet .    to stabilize the size of the extra dimension ,",
    "let us add the following term to the scalar field potential on the brane : @xmath32 such an addition will not affect the equations of motion provided @xmath33 which means that @xmath34 thus , we see that the size of the extra dimension is stabilized .",
    "it is necessary to note that the background solution presented above was obtained without imposing @xmath35 orbifold symmetry , which is inherent to the most brane world models , although the solution itself possesses reflection symmetry with respect to the point @xmath36 .",
    "we also suppose that the parameters of the potentials @xmath37 , when made dimensionless by the fundamental five - dimensional energy scale of the theory @xmath38 , should be positive quantities of the order @xmath39 , i.e. there should be no hierarchical difference in the parameters .",
    "we note that action ( [ actiondw ] ) and the corresponding four - dimensional effective theory can be used only at the energy scales @xmath40 measured in galilean coordinates on the brane .",
    "now let us turn to the examination of linearized gravity in the model .",
    "we represent the metric and the scalar field as @xmath41 to simplify the analysis , let us impose @xmath35 orbifold symmetry conditions ( although this symmetry is not necessary for obtaining the background solution ) .",
    "correspondingly , the metric @xmath15 and the scalar field @xmath42 satisfy the orbifold symmetry conditions @xmath43    we realize that imposing @xmath35 orbifold symmetry is a rather artificial procedure . but",
    "a consistent and thorough analysis of linearized gravity without this symmetry , i.e. taking into all the degrees of freedom coming from the metric , is a very complicated problem ( for example , we can not impose the gauge conditions which will be used later ) .",
    "at the same time , a theory with the orbifold symmetry makes sense and was studied , for example , in @xcite .",
    "moreover , we have a developed formalism for studying linearized gravity in brane world models stabilized by the bulk scalar field and with extra dimension forming the orbifold @xmath44 ",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the only difference from this case is that all the fields should have a `` good ''  behavior at the point @xmath36 , i.e. the fields should be smooth at @xmath36 , which corresponds to the absence of the brane as a physical object at this point . for these reasons , in this paper we restrict ourselves to the case with @xmath35 orbifold symmetry conditions .",
    "substituting representation ( [ metricpardw ] ) and ( [ metricpardw1 ] ) into action ( [ actiondw ] ) and keeping the terms of the second order in @xmath45 and @xmath46 , we get the second variation lagrangian of this action @xcite .",
    "this lagrangian is invariant under the gauge transformations @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the covariant derivative with respect to the background metric , provided @xmath49 satisfy the orbifold symmetry conditions @xmath50 these gauge transformations are a generalization of the gauge transformations in the unstabilized rs1 model @xcite .",
    "we will use them to isolate the physical degrees of freedom of the fields @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "we also note that since @xmath51 , the brane appears to be straight ( the disadvantages of bent - brane formalism were discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that with the help of these gauge transformations one can impose the gauge @xmath52 after which there remain the gauge transformations satisfying @xmath53    a substitution @xmath54 allows us to decouple the equations of motion , following from the second variation lagrangian , in gauge ( [ gauge ] ) .",
    "gauge transformations satisfying ( [ restr ] ) allow one to impose the traceless - transverse gauge condition on the field @xmath55",
    "@xcite @xmath56 the residual gauge transformations now being @xmath57 where @xmath58 . transformations",
    "( [ ok1 ] ) act only on the massless mode of the field @xmath55 and provide the correct number of degrees of freedom of the massless graviton @xcite .",
    "finally , we get the equations of motion in the interval @xmath59 with corresponding boundary conditions at the points @xmath36 , @xmath9 for the field @xmath55 @xmath60 @xmath61 and for the field @xmath62",

    "( [ ub ] ) . substituting into this equation @xmath66 we get : @xmath67 the boundary conditions suggest a substitution @xmath68 ( note that @xmath69 ) , which turns this equation into @xmath70 we see that the eigenfunctions @xmath71 are solutions of a sturm - liouville problem with von neumann boundary conditions . in accordance with the general theory",
    "@xcite , the problem at hand has no negative eigenvalues for arbitrary @xmath72 , only one zero eigenvalue , corresponding to @xmath73 .",
    "the eigenfunctions @xmath74 of eigenvalue problem ( [ bmode ] ) build a complete orthonormal set , the eigenfunction of the zero mode being @xmath75 expanding @xmath55 in this system @xmath76 we get four - dimensional tensor fields @xmath77 with definite masses .",
    "a standard technique gives us an expression for the four - dimensional planck mass on the brane @xmath78 and @xmath79 let us suppose that all fundamental parameters of the theory lie in the @xmath0 range . to have the hierarchy problem solved , one should take @xmath80 which means that @xmath81 and @xmath82 although eq .",

    "in order to find the mass spectrum of the scalar particles described by eq .",
    "( [ ug0 ] ) let us substitute @xmath85 into this equation : @xmath86 @xmath87 it is necessary to note that since the field @xmath46 should be smooth at the point @xmath36 , from ( [ gauge ] ) it follows that the value @xmath88 should be continuous at @xmath36 too .",

    "of course , the same conclusion can be made for any @xmath135 such that @xmath136 .",
    "as for the region @xmath137 , we have made a large number of numerical simulations with different values of @xmath138 .",
    "the behavior of the corresponding solutions is such that for @xmath139 : @xmath102 , @xmath102 or @xmath106 , @xmath105 respectively , analogous to the behavior of solutions presented on figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] , [ fig3 ] . a simple qualitative explanation of this fact can be given .",
    "for @xmath137 and @xmath140 the coefficient @xmath141 in ( [ eq_sc1 ] ) grows rapidly , which leads to the growth of the absolute value of function @xmath110 with coordinate @xmath142 for @xmath140 .",
    "nevertheless , for some value of @xmath138 such that @xmath137 there exists a solution , which satisfies condition ( [ gcondt ] ) .",
    "indeed , let us define a function @xmath143 .",
    "for @xmath144 it is positive , whereas for @xmath145 it is negative ( see figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] , [ fig3 ] , [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to suppose that there exists an appropriate value @xmath146 ( @xmath147 ) such that @xmath148 , which corresponds to a tachyonic mode .",
    "it appears to be very difficult to find the exact value of the tachyonic mass numerically . at the same time the physical mass of the tachyon",
    "is such that @xmath149 for the given values of the model parameters ( we suppose that @xmath150 ) .",
    "such energy scale lies outside the range of validity of our effective theory , described by action ( [ actiondw ] ) ( because @xmath151 , see section  2 ) . from the classical point of view",
    "it can be understood as follows : the tachyonic mode should behave as @xmath152 .",
    "the time derivative of the tachyon field @xmath153 , i.e. it is enhanced by the large value of @xmath154 in comparison with the tachyon field itself .",
    "thus , even if the value of the tachyon field is small , its time derivative would lead to breakdown of perturbative approach and corresponding nonlinear effects , coming from the five - dimensional curvature ( through substitution ( [ subst ] ) ) .",
    "another remarkable thing is that the wave function of the tachyon is such that if @xmath155 , then in the leading order @xmath156 .",
    "it means that when the nonlinear effects and ( or ) effects of the underlaying fundamental theory begin to affect the behavior of the theory in the bulk , the theory on the brane remain intact , because the coupling constant of the tachyon to matter on the brane , which is proportional to the value of the wave function on the brane , is negligibly small - much smaller than the coupling constant of the massless tensor graviton .",
    "thus , the runaway of the scalar field can be stopped in the bulk because of the nonlinear effects coming from action ( [ actiondw ] ) or from the underlaying fundamental theory .",
    "of course , we can not argue that it is indeed so , but such situation can be realized .    of course , our examination is not explicit since it is based on the numerical calculations .",
    "but we think that the analysis made testifies in favor of absence of scalar tachyons in the model below the energy scale of our effective theory ( [ actiondw ] ) . as for the ghosts ,",
    "the form of the effective action for the scalar modes ensures the proper signs of the appropriate kinetic terms @xcite .",
    "the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq_sc1 ] ) allows us to estimate the mass of the lowest scalar excitation and its coupling to matter on the brane .",
    "indeed , let us suppose that the lowest mass @xmath157 ( see ( [ eq_sc ] ) ) is such that @xmath158 . in this case we can neglect the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq_sc ] ) in comparison with the last but one term of this equation , and the solution of the resulting equation takes the form @xmath159 where @xmath160 is a normalization constant .",
    "let us suppose that the size of the extra dimension is such that @xmath161 , see ( [ l6 ] ) .",
    "the values @xmath162 and @xmath163 can be easily calculated , which gives us @xmath164 substituting ( [ estim1 ] ) and ( [ estim2 ] ) into ( [ bc11 ] ) we easily get @xmath165 for example , if @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 , the lowest mass @xmath169 .",
    "of course , it can be even smaller depending on the values of the parameters @xmath170 , @xmath171 and @xmath38 .",
    "it is also necessary to note that the analysis carried out with the help of the numerical solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq_sc ] ) for such small @xmath157 reproduces the results obtained using ( [ zero - one - mode ] ) with a very good accuracy ( of the order of @xmath172 ) .",
    "now let us calculate the coupling constant of the first scalar mode to matter on the brane . to this end",
    "we need to calculate the normalization constant @xmath160 .",
    "the normalization condition for the scalar modes takes the form @xcite @xmath173 it is more convenient to pass to the variable @xmath174 : @xmath175 the integral in ( [ int - t ] ) can be evaluated numerically , which gives us @xmath176 now we can calculate the coupling constant of the lightest scalar mode to matter on the brane ( see @xcite ) : @xmath177 one can see that @xmath178 for the given values of the fundamental parameters @xmath171 and @xmath38 .",
    "unfortunately it is impossible to calculate even the lowest mass of the tensor excitations using the method described above .",
    "one should carry out a very precise numerical analysis to get an information about the spectrum of the tensor modes .",
    "in this paper a model describing the scalar field minimally coupled to gravity in the spacetime with one compact extra dimension is proposed .",
    "it admits the existence of a single tensionful brane , contrary to the most brane world models with one compact extra dimension demanding the existence of at least two branes ( of course , except the simplest case of the add model @xcite with tensionless branes ) .",
    "we also showed that the model could be interesting in view of the hierarchy problem .",
    "the linearized gravity in the model was studied under the assumption of the @xmath35 orbifold symmetry .",
    "we obtained the expression for the four - dimensional planck mass on the brane in terms of the fundamental five - dimensional parameters of the theory .",
    "we also made a stability analysis of the model , ",
    "analytical for the tensor modes and numerical for the scalar modes , which resulted in the conclusion that the scalar sector of the model contain one tachyon , which corresponds to the result obtained in @xcite , its `` mass '' being of the order of the four - dimensional planck mass .",
    "thus , the model as it is , at least in the linear approximation , is unstable and its `` lifetime ''  is of the order of the four - dimensional planck time .",
    "nevertheless , the energy scale of the tachyon is such that multidimensional nonlinear fundamental underlaying theory can come to play and `` lift up '' the scalar sector from falling down .",
    "of course it is not necessarily so , but in principle it seems to be possible .    the background solution can also be used to describe the world with two branes . indeed , the second brane can be placed at the point @xmath179 , @xmath180 .",
    "the results of @xcite suggest that such a system is totally devoid of tachyons .",
    "it is very interesting to carry out a numerical calculation of the coupling constants and the masses of the tensor modes and a complete description of the scalar sector of the model , as well as the model without @xmath35 orbifold symmetry ( in the latter case there should appear antisymmetric modes ) .",
    "one can also use the model discussed in this paper ( for example , the stable configuration with two branes ) as a basis for constructing models with universal extra dimensions .",
