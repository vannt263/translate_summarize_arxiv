    "the @xmath2-scheme now becomes the standard renormalization scheme for the definition of the strong coupling constant .",
    "the measured coupling constant @xmath3 in some experiment at relatively high energy is converted to @xmath4 at some representative scale by perturbation theory .",
    "the current world average of such estimates gives @xmath5 .",
    "lattice qcd calculations , on the other hand , have a potential ability to determine the the strong coupling constant from the experimental inputs at low ( hadronic ) energy scale . in order to compare the coupling constant obtained at low energy by the lattice calculations with @xmath4 obtained at high energy ,",
    "the schrdinger functional scheme has been proposed by the alpha collaboration @xcite , and the scheme is shown to be successful . at present , the results on the running coupling constant of two massless flavor qcd are reported @xcite .    in the real world",
    "there are three light quarks .",
    "qcd simulations including three dynamical quark effects are thus required to understand the low energy qcd dynamics .",
    "our ultimate goal is to estimate @xmath4 from @xmath6 qcd simulations .",
    "recently , cp - pacs / jlqcd collaborations have started the @xmath6 qcd simulation employing an exact fermion algorithm developed for odd number of quark flavors @xcite .",
    "in particular , noteworthy results have been obtained in @xcite : there exists strong lattice artifacts associated with the phase transition in the @xmath6 qcd simulation with the combination of the plaquette gauge action and o(@xmath0 ) improved wilson quark action , while such lattice artifacts are absent for the renormalization group ( rg ) improved gauge action .",
    "hence , the collaborations have decided to adopt the combination of the rg improved gauge action and o(@xmath0 ) improved wilson quark action for the @xmath6 qcd simulations to obtain @xmath4 .    as a first step of our program",
    ", we study a schrdinger functional coupling with improved gauge actions in perturbation theory .",
    "in particular we perturbatively calculate the o(@xmath0 ) boundary improvement coefficients at 1-loop level with improved gauge actions for the pure su(3 ) gauge theory . combining this with the 1-loop results for the fermionic sector @xcite , we determine the o(@xmath0 ) boundary improvement coefficients at 1-loop , which can be used for the dynamical quark simulations in the future .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sect 2 , after a brief reminder of the schrdinger functional scheme and its extension to improved gauge actions , we specify an action used for latter calculations , and discuss the o(@xmath0 ) boundary counterterm . in sect 3",
    "the schrdinger functional coupling constant is defined and formula for a determination of the o(@xmath0 ) boundary improvement coefficients are given .",
    "the 1-loop computation is outlined in sect 4 , and the results of the o(@xmath0 ) boundary improvement coefficients are summarized in sect 5 . our conclusion is given in the last section , together with a discussion on the lattice artifact of the step scaling function .",
    "it has been shown by alpha collaboration that the schrdinger functional ( sf ) scheme is a powerful tool to probe energy evolutions of some physical quantities and to compute improvement coefficients as well as renormalization constants . in the sf scheme",

    "an extension of the sf scheme to improved gauge actions was first considered by klassen @xcite .",

    "each boundary consists of two time slices , to achieved the tree - level o(@xmath21 ) improvement .    in this paper",
    ", however , we adopt the formulation proposed by aoki , frezzotti and weisz @xcite , where each boundary consists of only one time slice and the tree - level o(@xmath0 ) improvement is achieved : dynamical variables to be integrated over are independent on the form of the action , plaquette or improved ones , and are given by the spatial link variables @xmath22 with @xmath23 and temporal link variables @xmath24 with @xmath25 on a cylinder with volume @xmath26 .",
    "this formulation is implemented more easily in numerical simulations .    the background field in eq.([eqn : v ] )",
    "gives the local minimum of the theory in both cases @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it has not been theoretically proved , however , that eq.([eqn : v ] ) is the absolute minimum for the improved gauge actions . this is checked only numerically @xcite .",
    "our improved action includes plaquette and rectangle loops , and is given by @xmath27         =         \\frac{1}{g^2_0 }         \\sum_{{\\cal c } \\in { \\cal s}_0 } w_0({\\cal c},g^2_0 ) { 2{\\cal l(c)}}+ \\frac{1}{g^2_0 }         \\sum_{{\\cal c } \\in { \\cal s}_1 } w_1({\\cal c},g^2_0 ) { 2{\\cal l(c ) } } ,       \\label{eqn : impaction}\\ ] ] with @xmath28,\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the ordered product of the link variables along loop @xmath30 contained in the set @xmath31(plaquette ) or @xmath32(rectangular ) . @xmath31 and @xmath32 consist of all loops of the given shape which can be drawn on the cylindrical lattice with volume @xmath26 .",
    "the loops involve only the `` dynamical links '' in the sense specified above , and spatial links on the boundaries at @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "in particular , rectangles protruding from the boundary of the cylinder are not included .",
    "one has to choose appropriate boundary weights to achieve the 1-loop level o(@xmath0 ) improvement for observables involving derivative with respect to the boundary . among various choices to achieve this ,",
    "ours is given as follows .",
    "@xmath35 @xmath36 with @xmath37 where coefficients @xmath38 and @xmath39 of the improved gauge action are normalized such that @xmath40",
    ". we call @xmath41 and @xmath42 o(@xmath0 ) boundary improvement coefficients .",
    "so far , 1-loop coefficients @xmath43 and @xmath44 are independent each other .",
    "weight factors @xmath45 , which include loop corrections , becomes the choice b of @xcite in the weak coupling limit .",
    "the choice b achieves the tree - level o(@xmath0 ) improvement and , at the same time , the lattice background field @xmath46 in eq.([eqn : v ] ) satisfies the equation of motion obtained by the variation of dynamical links .",
    "incidentally , we discuss the o(@xmath0 ) boundary counterterm from a different point of view . here",
    ", it is assumed that the plaquette loops and rectangle loops which lie completely on the cylinder @xmath26 are included in the action , and that each boundary consists of one time slice only . as explained in @xcite , at order @xmath0 in the pure gauge theory ,",
    "there are two possible boundary counterterms , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , each of which are summed over the @xmath33 or @xmath34 hyper plane .",
    "since the latter boundary term vanishes in the case of abelian constant boundary field , in the following , we consider only the former . in this case , we have three candidates for o(@xmath0 ) boundary counterterms which respect lattice symmetries ,    1 .   spatial sum of time - like plaquette loop that just touches one of the boundaries , 2",
    ".   spatial sum of rectangle loop that has exactly 2 links on a boundary , 3 .   spatial sum of rectangle loop that has exactly 1 link on a boundary ,    to satisfy one condition , the o(@xmath0 ) improvement condition .",
    "therefore , for simplicity , we can take a trivial weight for the term 3 , and we still have one degree of freedom for the choice of the boundary terms . at the tree level , however , the background field given in eq.([eqn : v ] ) must satisfy the equation of motion , so that one has to take @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( choice b ) . since no such an extra constraint exists for the 1-loop boundary terms , we can freely set a relation between @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which will be given in the next section .",
