    "the effect of impurities and quenched disorder in condensed matter represents an important problem both because of the ways in which disorder can change fundamental properties of a system and because any real material will inevitably possess imperfections .",
    "studies have shown dramatic consequences of disorder , such as the destruction of ordered phases and the introduction of new exotic ones , deviation from the universal behavior around transition points , and sometimes even the enhancement of useful material properties .",
    "liquid crystals , due to their soft elasticity , sensitivity to surface interactions , and experimental accessibility , provide an excellent opportunity for studying the effects of quenched disorder , which can be introduced experimentally through confinement of the liquid crystal to random porous media . a particular focus in this area",
    "has been the study of smectic liquid crystals in silica gels . in a detailed theoretical treatment of smectics in such random environments , radzihovsky , toner , and",
    "coworkers identified two forms of random - field disorder that the confinement introduces to the smectic ",
    "random orientational fields that couple to the nematic director and random positional fields that couple to the smectic density wave  @xcite .",
    "one conclusion of their study was that the smectic phase is unstable to arbitrarily weak random - field disorder , consistent with expectations for a phase that breaks a continuous symmetry in three dimensions .",
    "experimentally , considerable work has been dedicated toward investigating smectics in two types of silica gels , chemically rigid aerogels  @xcite and colloidal gels formed from aerosil particles  @xcite .",
    "the chemical compositions and structures of the two gels are very similar , but the hydogen - bonded aerosil gels have the potential to access a weaker regime of disorder . utilizing a wide range of probes , experiments on smectics confined to aerogels and aerosil gels have detailed the consequences of the confinement for the nematic and smectic phases , supporting the general picture that the gels impose random - field disorder that destroys the nematic to smectic transition",
    ".    among the predictions for smectics confined to gels is the potential formation of topologically ordered , `` bragg glass '' phases that are distinct from the high - temperature nematic phase by the absence of unbound dislocation loops .",
    "considerable evidence from theory and simulation supports the existence of a topologically ordered state with algebraic decay of correlations in the three - dimensional ( 3d ) random field xy model at low temperature  @xcite .",
    "( however , a recent argument based on the functional renormalization group approach has questioned the existence theoretically of such a phase in 3d xy systems  @xcite . ) since the nematic to smectic - a ( n - sma ) transition breaks 3d xy symmetry , one might hence expect that smectics confined to gels would be good candidates for realizing such an `` xy bragg glass '' phase . considering this possibility theoretically",
    ", radzihovsky and toner have concluded that the orientational random fields coupling to the nematic order and the soft elasticity of the smectic make smectics confined to gels distinct from standard random field xy systems .",
    "instead , they have introduced the possibility that a `` smectic bragg glass '' phase , which has short range correlations and is qualitatively different from the xy bragg glass , might form in smectics confined to gels  @xcite .",
    "however , the theoretical argument for the stability of the smectic bragg glass is inconclusive , and experimental evidence for the phase in smectics confined by silica gels has been contradictory  @xcite .",
    "jacobsen , saunders , _ et al .",
    "_ have further argued that smectics confined to uniaxially strained gels should fall into the universality class of random field xy systems and hence should form an `` xy bragg glass '' for sufficiently weak disorder  @xcite .",
    "the key difference between isotropic gels and strained gels is the effect of the orientational fields .",
    "specifically , if the strain alters the distribution of orientational fields , causing them to suppress nematic fluctuations at large length scales , then the smectic in strained gels should theoretically exhibit an xy bragg glass , provided the positional random fields are sufficiently weak .",
    "recent additional theoretical predictions regarding the smectic - a to smectic - c transition under confinement in strained gels has highlighted the potential for smectics in such an anisotropic environment to display exotic phase behavior  @xcite .    in an effort to understand the separate effects of orientational random fields and positional random fields on the n - sma transition and to test for the presence of an xy bragg glass phase , we have conducted an x - ray scattering study of smectic octylcyanobiphenyl ( 8cb ) confined to _ aligned _ aerosil gels .",
    "the structure of these gels dramatically alters the nature of the orientational fields , converting the random distribution found in isotropic gels into a sharply anisotropic distribution that macroscopically orders the nematic director .",
    "this anisotropy , or `` soft axis '' , makes the gels a faithful experimental realization of uniaxially strained systems considered by jacobsen , saunders , _ et al .",
    "_  in this paper , we report an analysis of the x - ray scattering results that indicates the presence of an xy bragg glass at low temperature for low densities of aligned aerosil .",
    "the signature feature of the xy bragg glass is a power - law divergent smectic scattering peak with a universal exponent .",
    "we note that in a preliminary report on our x - ray studies  @xcite , we concluded that 8cb confined to aligned aerosil gels did not exhibit such characteristics of the xy bragg glass phase . as we explain below , by adopting a physically better - motivated description of the behavior of the thermal critical fluctuations in smectics confined to aerosil gels  @xcite , we find that the previous analysis is not satisfactory in accounting for the smectic correlations at low temperature . instead , when a finite nematic domain size is incorporated into the analysis to reflect the imperfect nematic order in the aligned gels , comparisons between the x - ray scattering results for low densities of aerosil and the predictions for an xy bragg glass show excellent agreement .",
    "a discussion of these findings is given in sec .",
    "iii below .",
    "another important benefit of the macroscopic alignment of the nematic director by the anisotropic gels is the pronounced enhancement in signal - to - background in x - ray measurements relative to measurements on smectics in isotropic gels .",
    "taking advantage of this enhancement , we further provide in sec .  iv a detailed study of the smectic correlations at high temperature , which we analyze in terms of dynamic fluctuations that grow on approaching the critical region of the destroyed n - sma transition .",
    "this analysis shows that the correlations , as characterized by effective critical exponents for the correlation lengths and susceptibility , differ from those of pure 8cb even when the correlation lengths are considerably smaller than the gel pore size , providing evidence that the presence of quenched disorder alters the coupling between nematic and smectic order and its influence over smectic critical behavior .",
    "when combined with similar results from smectics confined to isotropic gels for effective critical exponents for the specific heat and smectic order parameter  @xcite , these findings provide a comprehensive picture of an evolution in the n - sma critical fluctuations toward conventional 3d xy behavior with increasing quenched disorder .",
    "pure 8cb undergoes an isotropic to nematic transition at @xmath0 = 313.98 k and a n - sma transition at @xmath1 = 306.97 k  @xcite .",
    "confinement of the liquid crystal to aligned aerosil gels was accomplished through a procedure described previously  @xcite .",
    "type 300 hydrophilic aerosil ( degussa corp . )  was dried under vacuum at 393 k for 24 hours . the dried powder along with appropriate quantities of 8cb ( frinton laboratories , inc . )",
    "was dissolved in high - purity acetone , and the mixtures were sonicated for at least two hours .",
    "the solutions were then heated to 318 k to evaporate the solvent slowly .",
    "after no visible trace of acetone remained , the samples were heated to 338 k under vacuum .",
    "the resulting composites consisted of 8cb confined to isotropic fractal aerosil gels like those of previous studies  @xcite . to create anisotropic gels",
    ", we placed each sample in a 2 tesla magnetic field and cycled the temperature between 308 k ( nematic phase ) and 318 k ( isotropic phase ) at least 100 times .",
    "due to the magnetic anisotropy of nematic 8cb , the director tends to align parallel to the magnetic field , in competition with the random orientational fields created by the gel . due to the elasticity of the nematic and the compliance of the gel ,",
    "this competition results in restructuring of the gel to accommodate the magnetic anisotropy . as a result ,",
    "the gels acquire a structure in which the orientational fields are no longer random but on average orient parallel to the aligning direction . since the gel continues to have a random structure positionally ,",
    "the positional fields that couple to the smectic density wave remain random .",
    "samples were prepared in this manner with aerosil densities ranging from @xmath2 g sil/@xmath3 8cb , which is just above the gelation threshold , to @xmath4 g sil/@xmath3 8cb , which is the upper limit above which efforts to align the gels were ineffectual .",
    "the smectic correlations that form in this anisotropic random environment were studied through high - resolution x - ray scattering .",
    "the experiments were conducted at the x22a beam line of the national synchrotron light source .",
    "the beam line is equipped with a ge(111 ) monochromator to select a beam of 10 kev x - rays .",
    "the measurements were performed in transmission geometry .",

    "the smectic scattering displays strong azimuthal anisotropy , indicating a narrow distribution of smectic layer - normal orientations .",
    "the alignment is slightly better ( the peak is narrower ) for lower density gels , consistent with the gels increased ability to resist restructuring with increasing density due to greater in mechanical strength  @xcite .",
    "we note these measurements were performed several weeks after removal of the magnetic field used to align the gels ; thus , the observed macroscopic alignment is a consequence of the gel and not the external field . as also shown in fig .",
    "[ mosaic ] , the quality of the nematic alignment displays negligible change in response to temperature excursions into the isotropic phase , demonstrating that the anisotropic gel structure is stable against thermal fluctuations and sufficiently robust to re - align the nematic director on subsequent cooling .",
    "indeed , samples are observed to remain aligned after repeated heating into the isotropic phase and after storage for several months .",
    "thus , the random orientational fields of the isotropic gel have been converted into fields with long - range order that align the nematic director macroscopically .",

    "the intensity displays a pronounced peak corresponding to the smectic scattering , while in the perpendicular direction the intensity shows no evidence of smectic scattering , consistent with the strong anisotropy implied by fig .  1 .",
    "we ascribe the scattering intensity along @xmath10 entirely to the gel structure and note that an essentially identical background intensity contributes to the scattering along @xmath9 . in order to isolate the smectic scattering from this background , we subtract the intensity along @xmath10 from the intensity along @xmath9 .",

    ", this analysis provides a flawed physical picture ; however , this coincidence in the correlation lengths suggests that the smectic correlations that form in the aligned gels and the isotropic gels are similar .",
    "since the xy bragg glass phase is not expected to be relevant to smectics confined to isotropic gels , one might interpret this similarity as evidence against the xy bragg glass phase forming in the aligned gels .",
    "additional experimental work on other smectic liquid crystals confined to aligned gels that test for the presence of the xy bragg glass phase would help in clarifying the stability of this topologically ordered phase within the anisotropic random environment created by the gel .",
    "as described above , the high - temperature scattering intensity of 8cb confined to aligned aerosil gels is characterized by dynamic critical fluctuations .",
    "we interpret these fluctuations as the remnants of the n - sma critical point that is destroyed by the quenched disorder ( and not directly with the transition to the xy bragg glass phase which presumably has a significantly subtler signature in the x - ray scattering than the observed robust peaks illustrated in fig .  3 ) .",
    "although the n - sma critical point is obtained strictly only in the presence of zero quenched disorder , upon cooling in weak disorder the system in some sense comes in close proximity to the critical point and should therefore display critical smectic fluctuations .",
    "further , if the disorder is sufficiently weak , the susceptibility and correlation lengths charactering these fluctuations , while non - singular , should display pseudo - critical behavior over an extended range of reduced temperature .",
    "this premise leads us to define the effective transition temperature t@xmath32 as the temperature at which these quantities would diverge if their growth were not truncated : @xmath66 where @xmath67t@xmath68t@xmath69t@xmath32 is the reduced temperature , and @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 are effective critical exponents for @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath17 , respectively .",

    "the values of @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 for 8cb confined to aligned aerosil gels are distinctly different from those of pure 8cb , indicating that the quenched disorder introduced by the gel not only affects the low - temperature smectic order but also modifies the pre - transitional critical fluctuations . at sufficiently high temperature",
    "the correlation lengths are small compared to the mean pore chord @xmath75 of the gels  @xcite , which is also listed in table  [ ch4_table_result ] .",
    "hence , the disorder caused by the gels should have little direct effect on the smectic fluctuations well above t@xmath32 . in the simplest picture of the n - sma transition , the formation of the smectic density wave breaks 3d xy symmetry , and thus the critical behavior of pure liquid crystals could be expected to match that of the 3d xy model .",
    "however , the observed critical behavior of pure 8cb and other smectic liquid crystals typically deviates from that of the 3d xy model .",
    "these deviations are illustrated by the difference in critical exponent values for pure 8cb and the 3d xy model listed in table  [ ch4_table_result ] .",
    "the precise nature of these deviations , whose source likely involves couplings between the smectic order parameter and the nematic order , has been a long - standing problem .",
    "as described above , when a smectic liquid crystal is confined to an aligned aerosil gel , it experiences not only positional disorder that couples to the smectic density wave but also anisotropic orientational fields that couple to the nematic order , thereby modifying the nematic behavior .",

    "the ratio is one due to the isotropic scaling of correlations .",
    "however , for pure 8cb the scalings are highly anisotropic ( @xmath78 = 1.314 ) , consistent with behavior seen in various other smectic liquid crystals  @xcite .",
    "patton and andereck have advanced a theory that this anisotropic scaling results from coupling between nematic director fluctuations and the smectic order parameter  @xcite .",
    "for 8cb confined to aligned aerosil gels , the ratio @xmath79 shows much weaker scaling anisotropy than in pure 8cb .",
    "one interpretation for this decreased scaling anisotropy is that pinning of the nematic director by the anisotropic orientational fields suppresses long - wavelength nematic fluctuations , thus weakening their influence over the smectic critical behavior .    while the decrease in @xmath79 for 8cb confined to aligned aerosil gels compared with @xmath79 for pure 8cb indicates qualitatively that the quenched disorder weakens nematic - smectic coupling , this observation",
    "would be made stronger with a quantitative measure of this weakening . in pure liquid crystals",

    "we note a very similar linear mapping of aerosil density to effective mcmillan ratio was introduced previously for 8cb and 4o.8 confined to isotropic aerosil gels  @xcite . in these cases , the mapping was shown to collapse successfully effective heat capacity and order parameter exponents , @xmath54 and @xmath83 , for various aerosil densities onto the trends of pure liquid crystals .",
