    "for some time now it is known that transverse momentum spectra of different kinds measured in multiparticle production processes , which change character from exponential at small values of @xmath10 to power - like at large @xmath10 , can be described by a simple two - parameter formula , @xmath11 this was first proposed in @xcite as the simplest formula extrapolating the large @xmath10 power behavior expected from parton collisions to exponential behavior observed for @xmath12 . at present",
    "it is known as the qcd - based _",
    "hagedorn formula _",

    "( [ eq : fittn ] ) , with @xmath13 replaced by @xmath14 , is more widely known as the tsallis formula @xcite . in this case , @xmath7 is known as a nonextensivity parameter . in this form ,",
    "( [ eq : fittn ] ) is usually supposed to represent a nonextensive generalization of the boltzmann - gibbs exponential distribution , @xmath15 , used in a statistical description of multiparticle production processes , with @xmath7 being a new parameter , in addition to previous `` temperature '' @xmath16 .",
    "such an approach is known as nonextensive statistics @xcite in which the parameter @xmath7 summarily describes all features causing a departure from the usual boltzmann - gibbs statistics ( in particular it can be shown that it is directly related to the possible intrinsic , nonstatistical fluctuations of the temperature @xmath16 @xcite ) .",
    "however , the tsallis distribution also emerges from a number of other more dynamical mechanisms , for example see @xcite for more details and references . in all possible scenarios leading to eq .",
    "( [ eq : fittn ] ) , the `` temperature '' , or , in general , scale parameter @xmath16 , is given by the mean value of the transverse momentum , @xmath17 , and we do not discuss here its possible dependence on energy and the nonextensivity parameter . for large values of transverse momenta , @xmath18 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : fittn ] ) becomes scale free ( independent of @xmath16 ) distribution .",
    "the tsallis distribution was successfully used for a description of all kinds of multiparticle production processes in a wide range of incident energy ( from few gev up to few tev ) and in a broad range of transverse momenta ( see , for example , reviews @xcite . in particular , it turned out that it also successfully describes transverse momenta of charged particles measured by lhc experiments , the flux of which changes by over @xmath19 orders of magnitude @xcite dependent prefactor , the presence of which affects the value of the @xmath7 parameter . also , in the low @xmath10 domain , tsallis distribution with @xmath20 seems to do better than the one with @xmath10 .",
    "both choices are possible , depending on the circumstances , cf .",
    "@xcite for details . in our case",
    "both would result in the same conclusions . ] .",
    "the tsallis distribution was recently used in an analysis of the distribution of the longitudinal component of momenta of particles within jets produced in @xmath8 collisions @xcite which , from this point of view , is similar to what was found in @xmath21 collisions @xcite .",
    "recent atlas data @xcite allow us to extend such an analysis to transverse characteristics of jets and charged particles within them .",
    "this is because they provide both the distributions of transverse momenta of jets produced at lhc energies , @xmath0 , and distributions of transverse momenta of particles produced within these jets ( defined relative to the jets ) , @xmath1 .",
    "one can then retrieve and discuss the respective nonextensivity parameters of jets , @xmath3 , and particles produced within them , @xmath4 .",
    "in addition , because @xcite at the same time also provides multiplicity distributions within jets , @xmath22 , it is possible to confront both nonextensivities with that obtained from an analysis of @xmath22 , @xmath6 .",
    "this is the subject of the present work .",
    "in what follows we shall concentrate on atlas data @xcite",
    ". they were taken at energy @xmath23 tev and in rapidity window @xmath24 measured jets observed in very narrow jet cones defined by @xmath25 ( where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are , respectively , the azimuthal angle and the pseudorapidity of the hadrons relative to that of the jet , @xmath28 , with @xmath29 being the polar angle ) , namely @xmath30 .",
    "distributions of transverse momenta , @xmath31 , of jets of charged particles were observed , @xmath32 and also distributions of transverse momenta @xmath33 of all @xmath34 particles ( only charged ) in the jet , @xmath35 in addition , @xcite also provides multiplicity distributions of particles produced within observed jets , @xmath22 .",
    "it should be stressed that the pure power law distribution , @xmath36 , is not experimentally observed for jets .",
    "the observed slope parameter @xmath37 depends on @xmath10 , @xmath38",
    ". however , a tsallis distribution ( [ eq : fittn ] ) emerges if one accounts for this dependence and assumes it in the following two parameter ( @xmath13 and @xmath16 ) form , @xmath39 in this case , the transverse momentum distribution for jets can be fitted by a tsallis formula ( [ eq : fittn ] ) with @xmath40 and @xmath41 gev , cf .",

    "[ fig3 ] differ from those from @xcite and presented in fig .",
    "namely , they were collected for @xmath52 and @xmath53 gev ( to be compared with @xmath54 and @xmath55 gev in the former case ) .",

    "[ fig4 ] this relation is linear , i.e. , the corresponding @xmath22 are indeed of nbd or bd type ( the deviation from linearity occurs only for @xmath58 , for which one encounters experimental difficulties and which , in fact , can be omitted from our analysis ) . from parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 obtained this way we can deduce , using eqs .",

    "notice that their values correspond closely to those obtained from the distributions of @xmath10 in jets presented in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the values of nonextensivity parameters obtained from an analysis of multiplicity distributions and distributions of @xmath10 of jets and in jets can now be compared with the respective nonextensivity parameters obtained in measurements of @xmath10 distributions in other experiments on minimum bias @xmath8 collisions in which the range of @xmath10 and multiplicities were similar and energies of which were similar to energies of the jets investigated .",
    "the corresponding results for the dependence of the resulting nonextensive parameters @xmath7 as a function of the measured mean multiplicity @xmath61 are presented in fig . [ fig5 ] .",
    "the approximate similarity of these results is clearly visible is in order here .",
    "so far we were estimating the parameter @xmath7 from distributions of @xmath10 or @xmath34 and discussing its energy dependence , @xmath65 , as obtained from different experiments @xcite . here",
    "we would like to compare distributions of particles in @xmath66 collisions to those in jets , for which , unfortunately , we do not know the corresponding energy @xmath67 . on the other hand ,",

    "triangles at small @xmath61 are obtained from data @xcite , those for larger @xmath61 from @xcite .",
    "full squares and circles are from data on multiparticle production in @xmath66 collisions and , correspondingly , squares ( inelastic data ) are from compilation for lab energy @xmath68 gev presented in @xcite , whereas circles ( non - single diffractive data ) are from compilation presented in @xcite.,width=321 ]    the results presented here can be summarized in the following way : @xmath69 a tsallis distribution successfully describes inclusive @xmath10 distributions in a wide range of transverse momenta for all energies measured so far @xcite .",
    "@xmath70 this is also true for the distribution of transverse momenta of jets as shown in fig .",
    "the nonextensivity parameter in this case , @xmath71 , is comparable to @xmath72 describing inclusive distributions of transverse momenta of particles at the same energy @xmath23 tev @xcite . @xmath73",
    "the tsallis distribution also describes transverse momenta distributions of particles in jets .",
    "the values of @xmath7 obtained in this case are roughly the same as those obtained from an analyzes of multiplicity distributions in these jets .",
    "it should be noted that , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , values of the nonextensivity parameter @xmath7 for particles in jets correspond rather closely to values of @xmath7 obtained from the inclusive distributions measured in @xmath8 collisions ( for the corresponding energies available for production ) in the similar ranges of transverse momenta distributions discussed recently ( cf . @xcite and references therein ) , apparently being a consequence of gluon saturation at some scale @xmath74 .",
    "it turns out that scaled distributions can be described by a tsallis formula @xcite with the saturation scale being hidden in the parameter @xmath16 ( not @xmath7 ) ; in fact to get scaling one has to allow for @xmath16 being dependent on @xmath10 .",
    "one should , however , be aware of the fact that in the energy domain discussed here scaling seems to be violated @xcite . ] .    to conclude , one observes a kind of similarity ( in what concerns values of the corresponding nonextensivity parameters ) of multiplicity distributions @xmath22 and transverse momentum distributions @xmath75 of particles produced in minimum bias collisions @xmath8 and particles in jets of comparable energies .",
    "this can be interpreted as a demonstration that the mechanisms of particle production in both cases are the same or , at least , are similar and contain some _ common part _ @xcite .",
    "this common part , in turn , can be identified with the self - similarity character of the production process in both cases , resulting in a kind of cascade process , which always results in a tsallis distribution @xcite . actually , this is a very old idea , introduced already by hagedorn in @xcite .",
    "he assumed that the production of hadrons proceeds through formation of _ fireballs which are a statistical equilibrium of an undetermined number of all kinds of fireballs , each of which in turn is considered to be a fireball_. in fact this was used as a justification in the first proposed generalization of the hagedorn model , considered as a statistical model , to @xmath7-statistics , cf . , @xcite .",
    "in the pure dynamical qcd approach to hadronization , one encounters the same idea , as , for example , that presented in @xcite . in it partons fragment into final state hadrons through multiple sub - jet production . as a result one has a _ self - similar behavior of cascade of jets to sub - jets to sub - sub - jets  to final state hadrons_.",
    "using the tsallis nonextensive approach , we have analysed recent data found by the lhc atlas experiment @xcite on transverse momentum distributions of jets , particles within jets and their multiplicity distributions .",
    "the values of the respective nonextensivity parameters obtained this way , when compared with the corresponding values obtained from the inclusive distributions measured in @xmath8 collisions for the corresponding energies available for production and in similar ranges of transverse momenta , were found to be similar .",
    "this can be considered as strong evidence of the existence of some common mechanism behind all these processes which we tentatively identify with a _ self - similarity _ property and cascade type processes based on multiplicative noise @xcite .",
    "they are known to lead to a tsallis distribution ( with @xmath76 given by fluctuations of multiplicative noise @xmath77 @xcite ) of the same type as those describing statistical or thermodynamical systems ( with @xmath78 given by fluctuations of temperature @xmath16 @xcite ) .",
    "it is worth reminding at this point that both tsallis distribution and the negative binomial distribution can be regarded as a consequence of using a gamma distribution for clusters formed before fragmentation .",
    "whereas the former arises from the fluctuations of temperature in a boltzman - gibs distribution , the latter arises from the fluctuations of mean multiplicity in a poissonian distribution .",
    "the common feature is that in both cases fluctuations are given by a gamma distribution which is stable under the size distribution , i.e. , exhibits self - similarity and scaling behavior ( actually , nbd is also a self - similar distribution @xcite ) .",
    "this indicates once more that self - similarity encountered in processes under consideration is the physical ground of the observed similarities discusses here .",
    "results presented here could possibly open discussion about the validity of thermal models @xcite .",
