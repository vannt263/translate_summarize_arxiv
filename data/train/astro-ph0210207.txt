    "it is widely assumed that brittle fractures caused by maxwell or other stresses in neutron star crusts are involved in a number of phenomena , for example , the soft gamma repeaters ( sgr ) , the persistent emission of the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axp ) ( thompson et al 2000 ) , and large pulsar glitches ( ruderman , zhu & chen 1998 ) . in current theories of the axp and sgr sources , brittle fractures , propagating with a velocity of the order of the shear - wave velocity @xmath0 , generate shear waves which in turn couple with magnetospheric alfvn modes . at angular frequencies @xmath1 rad s@xmath2",
    ", the coupling is thought to be an efficient mechanism for energy transfer to the magnetosphere , as shown by blaes et al ( 1989 ) .",
    "statistical comparisons of sgr burst properties with those of terrestrial earthquakes are not inconsistent with the brittle fracture assumption ( hurley et al 1994 , cheng et al 1996 , gogus et al 1999 ) .",
    "however , the purpose of this letter is to note that elementary deductions of the properties of neutron - star fault planes show that brittle fracture is not possible .",
    "the relation between stability and stratification for neutron star matter ( reisenegger & goldreich 1992 ; see also jones 2002 ) constrains the movement of matter , bounded by any fault plane which may be formed , to an almost exactly spherical equipotential surface .",
    "shear strain ( for in - plane shear ) is shown in figure 1 by the displacement of a series of constant surfaces in lagrangian coordinates which intersect a local element of the fault plane @xmath3 . in the neutron star case",
    ", it might be caused by a changing maxwell stress reflecting evolution of the internal magnetic flux density distribution .",
    "the components @xmath4 of the stress tensor act on the surfaces of the volume elements shown on opposite sides of the fault - plane .",
    "( we assume an isotropic elastic medium in which , before fracture , stress propagates perfectly across the plane . ) in the brittle fracture of a terrestrial earthquake , the stress falls at the instant of failure from @xmath5 to a much smaller value ( zero in the ideal case ) .",
    "stress energy is largely converted to kinetic energy so that strain relaxation @xmath6 occurs with an acceleration @xmath7 such that shear waves are generated efficiently ( see kostrov & das 1988 concerning the definition of a tectonic earthquake source ) .",
    "the mechanical properties of terrestrial matter , as a function of depth , have been tabulated , for example , in kaye & laby ( 1986 ) . at a typical earthquake focus depth of 15 km , the pressure @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the shear modulus .",
    "crack propagation is possible because @xmath10 is not so large that it inhibits void formation behind the tip . at greater depths ,",
    "the increases in @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the melting temperature , and in @xmath13 both inhibit the void formation which is necessary for crack propagation .",
    "thus a transition to plastic stress - response occurs at approximately 20 km depth because dislocation glide is not pressure - inhibited ( see scholz 1990 ) .",
    "tectonic earthquake sources are not found in the plastic region .",
    "the deep - focus sources , which occur in subduction zones at depths up to 500 km , are probably intermittently running polymorphic phase transitions , following the original idea of p. w. bridgman ( 1945 ) .",
    "the contrast with neutron - star matter is extreme because the latter is not absolutely stable , being in equilibrium only at finite pressure .",
    "those isotropic components of the stress tensor derived from the electrons and from coulomb interaction ( the coulomb - electron partial pressure @xmath14 which excludes the neutron partial pressure ) are one or two orders of magnitude larger than the shear modulus and this largely determines the structure of defects such as monovacancies ( jones 1999 ) .",
    "the way in which the nearest neighbours to a monovacancy site relax by displacement considerably reduces the monovacancy formation enthalpy , for example , to 13 mev at a matter density of @xmath15 g @xmath16 in the neutron - drip region .",
    "such relaxation is not possible for the nuclei surrounding a void whose linear dimension is of the order of , or greater than , the relativistic electron screening length . in any solid for which the inequality @xmath17 is satisfied ,",
    "it is anticipated that a void , even if formed , would be unstable against dissociation to monovacancies with a lifetime , in neutron - star matter , perhaps of the order of @xmath18 s. thus we can assert that nuclei at a fault plane may have different , probably less , small - distance order than exists elsewhere but almost the same nearest - neighbour separations .",
    "reference to the theory of crack stability ( anderson 1995 , see also landau & lifshitz 1970 ) shows that , in brittle fracture , the important properties of the stress distribution of an unstable crack are the zero on the fault plane and the singularity at its tip ( in the ideal case ) which enable it to propagate into regions of much lower stress .",
    "these do not exist in neutron stars owing to the impossibility of forming a sufficiently long - lived void .",
    "previous formation enthalpy calculations ( jones 2001 ) have shown that an amorphous heterogeneous solid phase is formed in the crust and is likely to persist as the star cools .",
    "the mean square deviation @xmath19 from the average nuclear charge is large compared with unity .",
    "the system is analogous with a multi - component amorphous alloy in having some local order , which vanishes with increasing length scales , but differs in having no absolute stability .",
    "shear stress acting on such a system produces faults in the form of localized shear bands .",
    "these are thin layers of inhomogeneuos plastic flow , formed sequentially , which permit local strain relaxation through through dissipation and the transfer of stress energy to neighbouring regions .",
    "a shear band has structure similar to a viscous layer being deformed adiabatically between parallel plates ( see , for example , xing et al 1999 , who also give a typical stress - strain relation ) .",
    "the process is not analogous with brittle fracture because most of the local stress energy , instead of being converted to kinetic energy , is either dissipated or transferred to neighbouring regions .",
    "the rotation of a circular cylinder of solid crust under maxwell stress , by plastic flow on the cylindrical fault surface delimiting it , is an elementary example satisfying the stratification and stability constraint ( see also thompson et al 2000 ) .",
    "the plastic flow threshold is @xmath20 and the maxwell stress is assumed to be @xmath21 , decreasing with slip distance @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are constants .",
    "suppose that an unspecified stress - transfer incident results in @xmath25 at some instant .",
    "the equation of motion is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the matter density and @xmath28 the cylinder radius .",
    "the velocity at time @xmath29 during slip through a distance @xmath30 , where @xmath31 , is @xmath32 .",
    "the angular velocity @xmath33 is small compared with the values @xmath34",
    "rad s@xmath2 for which there is efficient coupling of shear and alfvn waves .",
    "( it is @xmath35 rad s@xmath2 for the maximum shear stress @xmath36 dyne @xmath37 , @xmath38 g @xmath16 , and @xmath39 cm . ) in principle , adiabatic heating on the fault surface could lead to a localized solid - liquid phase transition , the reduction in viscosity by many orders of magnitude giving slip velocities much larger than @xmath40 .",
    "an order of magnitude estimate of the condition that slip and adiabatic heating should increase the temperature to @xmath12 on the fault surface is given by @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the thermal conductivity and @xmath43 the specific heat . at a typical density of @xmath44 g @xmath16 , @xmath45 k for the lattice parameters given by negele & vautherin ( 1973 ) .",
    "the specific heat is almost entirely that of normal neutrons ; @xmath46 erg @xmath16k@xmath2 for an effective mass of @xmath47 ( see pines & nozieres 1966 ) .",
    "the thermal conductivity @xmath48 erg cm@xmath2s@xmath2k@xmath2 has been estimated from the electron conductivity results given by gnedin et al ( 2001 ) . for @xmath50 dyne @xmath37 , this condition shows that a local slip distance exceeding @xmath51 cm would be required to increase the fault surface temperature to @xmath12 .",
    "thus a slip of this order of magnitude could produce melting and subsequent slip velocities much larger than @xmath40 .",
    "but the assumption of a single shear band in the form of a cylindrical fault surface is unique and does not appear realistic .",
    "the general case is of more complex movements , with considerable deformation , in the form of plastic flow where stress transfer produces many distinct shear bands with small slip distances not satisfying the melting condition . in such flow ,",
    "the velocity @xmath52 and acceleration @xmath53 necessary for efficient shear wave generation at angular velocity @xmath54 are not reached .",
    "our conclusion is that the strain relaxation conditions necessary for the generation of shear waves are not present in neutron stars .",
    "this need not have a great impact on theories of the pulsar glitch phenomena . in the theory of ruderman , zhu & chen ( 1998 ) , the movements caused by maxwell stress and by spin - down of the neutron superfluid in the core can be many orders of magnitude slower than those associated with brittle fracture and yet remain consistent with the observed upper limit on the spin - up time for vela glitches . but the hypothesis that a plastic - brittle transition , on cooling to internal temperature @xmath55 at ages between @xmath56 and @xmath57 yr , is responsible for the absence of large glitches in very young pulsars is not consistent with the properties of neutron - star matter fault - planes deduced here",
    ". these may also be useful in determining the mechanism for energy release in axp and sgr sources ( thompson & duncan 1996 , thompson et al 2000 ) .",
    "these authors assume that a plastic - brittle transition occurs at internal magnetic flux densities near to @xmath58 , and that brittle fractures at @xmath59 are the source of alfvn wave generation ( blaes et al 1989 ) leading to both quiescent and burst emission .",
    "but the mode of fracture is determined by the nature of the solid , and its occurrence depends not on the absolute size of maxwell stress components but on the extent to which they deviate from values that would give an equilibrium in a completely liquid star .",
    "our conclusion , that brittle fracture is not possible at any temperature , indicates that other mechanisms ( see , for example , thompson , lyutikov & kulkarni 2002 ; mereghetti et al 2002 ) need to be considered in more detail .",
