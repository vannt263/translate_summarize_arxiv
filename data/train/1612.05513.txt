    "employing cellulose in biofuel production can make this advancing technology a highly competitive alternative to fossil fuel . as a major component of biomass , cellulose is non - expensive and the most abundant polysaccharide on earth@xcite .",
    "however , the application of cellulose in biofull production requires degradation of it into smaller sugars , which has shown to be a major obstacle , requiring both hydrolytic enzymes and thermal work .",
    "this remarkable stability is caused by the structure of very long glucan chains , which are comprised of glucose monomers , coupled together by @xmath2 - 1,4 glycosidic linkages .",
    "the glucan chains interact with each other by an extensive network of inter- and intra - molecular hydrogen bonds invovling the three hydroxyl groups of each glucose monomer , which limits the accessibility of hydrolytic enzymes to the glycosidic linkages.@xcite    lately , a class of fungal and bacterial enzymes called lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases ( lpmos ) have attracted considerable attention due to their ability to enhance polysaccharide depolymerization , thereby providing a route to efficient conversion of cellulose into fermantable sugars@xcite .",
    "the first industrial applications have already been seen for ethanol production.@xcite    , scaledwidth=75.0% ]    initially , lpmo enzymes@xcite were assumed to be solely hydrolytic and were classified as belonging to the glycoside hydrolase 61 ( gh61 ) and carbohydrate - binding modules 33 ( cbm33 ) families . an initial report questioning whether gh61 indeed were hydrolases occurred in 2008@xcite , but the role of lpmos in polysaccharide degradation was first demonstrated in 2010 , when a lpmo from the gh61 family was shown to be able to disrupt the surface of recalcitrant cellulose by an oxidative mechanism.@xcite .",
    "the same year a similar activity was reported for a bacterial lpmo@xcite belonging to the cbm33 family ( a few earlier reports are also known from the patent literature@xcite ) .",
    "importantly , these studies suggested involvement of a metal , although the nature of this metal was not immediately elucidated .",
    "yet , it was clear that the lpmos employed a common mechanism , different from traditional glycoside hydrolases .",
    "accordingly , the enzymes were reclassified as auxiliary activity enzymes aa9 ( formerly gh61 ) and aa10 ( formerly cbm33).@xcite .",
    "the reports of complete x - ray structures for several aa9 enzymes@xcite solved the initial confusion concerning the metal site@xcite , and it is now known that both aa9 and aa10 enzymes contain a single copper ion@xcite .    the active site of an aa9 enzyme is shown in figure [ lpmo_active_site ] , together with a putative mechanism.@xcite for the resting state , * 1 * , the first coordination sphere is distorted octahedral and comprised of a weakly coordinated tyrosine , two water molecules and an unusual _ histidine brace _ comprised of two histidine residues , coordinating through the imidazole group .",
    "one of these is the n - terminal residue , which also coordinates through the terminal group@xcite , as also seen in the particulate methane monooxygenases.@xcite notably , a peculiar methylation of this n - terminal histidine has been observed in many fungal lpmo structures@xcite , although its role is unclear , as the non - methylated enzyme is also catalytically active@xcite . electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) spectroscopy@xcite have shown that * 1 * contains a cu@xmath0 ion@xcite .",
    "the epr spectra provide an important complement to x - ray structures , because cu is known to be photo - reduced in the x - ray beam .",
    "in fact , it is likely that most lpmo crystal structures have contained a mixture of cu@xmath0 and cu@xmath1@xcite .",
    "the reduction gives rise to a lowering of the coordination number , and many aa10 structures have been reported with an approximate t - shaped coordination environment indicating that the metal site contains a cu@xmath1 ion.@xcite    the mechanism of the lpmos is far from clarified and even the order of reduction , substrate binding and uptake is unknown , as is suggested by figure [ lpmo_active_site ] .",
    "a complicating factor is that there is much sequence variation within the lpmo family@xcite and different lpmos might employ slightly different mechanisms .",
    "for instance , the axial tyrosine ( tyr175 in figure [ lpmo_active_site ] ) is replaced by phenylalanine in most aa10 lpmos .",
    "different mechanism could explain the differing substrate preferences among the lpmos : fungal aa9 enzymes oxidize cellulose@xcite , whereas aa10 enzymes oxidize both cellulose@xcite and chitin@xcite .",
    "fungal lpmos that break down chitin or starch have also been identified and are classified as aa11@xcite and aa13@xcite , respectively .",
    "apart from varying preferences with respect to substrate , lpmos have also different regioselectivity : some oxidize only the c1 atom of the glycoside linkage , others oxidze only the c4 atom , whereas still others can oxidize both c1 and c4 .",
    "this has led to a sub - classification of the aa9 family , in that enzymes belonging to the lpmo type 1 subfamily are c1 specific , those belonging to lpmo type 2 are c4 specific , and those belonging to lpmo type 3 oxidize both c1 and c4@xcite .",
    "bacterial lpmos ( aa10 ) were initially thought to be c1 specific@xcite until a c4 specific counterexample was identified.@xcite    while the insight gained from experimental studies has been paramount , it has often been complemented by computational chemistry .",
    "for instance , the interaction between a fungal lpmo and cellulose has been studied with molecular dynamics ( md ) methods@xcite , whereas the structural change upon cu@xmath0 reduction ( * * 1**@xmath3 * 2 * in figure [ lpmo_active_site ] ) has been studied with x - ray diffraction and x - ray absorption combined with density functional theory ( dft)@xcite . the copper superoxide intermediate ( * 3 * ) has also been the target of multiple combined theoretical and experimental studies and has played a central role in mechanistic suggestions so far .",
    "this intermediate is believed to either directly abstract a hydrogen from the substrate@xcite or function as precursor for a more reactive copper ",
    "oxyl species that is involved in hydrogen abstraction@xcite .",
    "the coordination of to cu in * 3 * may give rise to two isomers , because there are two possible coordination sites for ( although this complication has often been overlooked ) .",
    "one study@xcite suggested that binds in an axial position , trans to tyr175 , replacing w229 ( cf .",
    "figure [ lpmo_active_site ] ) , whereas a combined spectroscopic and computational study suggested that instead binds equatorially@xcite , replacing w230 .",
    "however , each study investigated only one of the two isomers .",
    "further , all previous computation studies on lpmos have been carried out with small models of the active site@xcite , although it has been shown that the protein environment is crucial for accurate structures and energetics in studies on transition - metal enzymes.@xcite    in this study , we investigate the reduction of the lpmo active site from * 1 * to * 2 * , as well as both isomers of * 3*. we include the protein environment with the combined quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics ( qm / mm ) methodology.@xcite with our qm / mm protocol we can show that the small cluster models of the active site employed previously can cause large errors in the obtained structures .",
    "the binding of superoxide , to cu@xmath0 in * 3 * may give rise to either a triplet spin - state or an antiferromagnetically coupled singlet state , and our investigation considers both .",
    "the singlet state was previously found to be only @xmath420 kj / mol above the triplet ground state@xcite and could therefore be involved in catalytic turnover .",
    "the starting coordinates where taken from the 1.5  resolution x - ray structure from _ thermoascus aurantiacus _ , which belongs to the fungal lpmo ( type 3 ) family.@xcite .",
    "this structure contains the protein in its resting state , possibly with a partly reduced active - site cu ion .",
    "the structure is deposited in the protein data bank ( 2yet ) and was also employed in a previous computational study@xcite .",
    "the structure is a dimer that contains 462 amino acids and 625 crystal water molecules , amounting to 4199 atoms in total . here",
    ", we consider only the monomer ( chain a ) and the remainder of this paper refers to chain a , unless explicitly specified .",
    "the crystal structure contains eight amino acids with alternative conformations , namely asp10 , met25 , ser26 , asn27 , leu41 , ser117 , gln167 and lys214 .",
    "we selected the conformation with highest occupation or the first conformation if they had the same occupation numbers .",
    "hydrogen atoms were added using the maestro protein preparation tools.@xcite for the titratable residues ( 2 arginine , 5 lysine , 7 histidine , 14 aspartate and 5 glutamate residues ) the maestro program employs the propka program@xcite to estimate pk@xmath5 values .",
    "the individual residues were additionally visually inspected and their solvent exposure and hydrogen - bond network were assessed . in this study ,",
    "all arg and lys were protonated ( + 1 ) whereas the asp and glu residues were in their carboxylate forms ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the his residues have two possible protonation sites and in the following , we denote histidines as hie ( n@xmath7 protonated ) , hid ( n@xmath8 protonated ) or hip ( both nitrogens protonated ) .",
    "the first ( n - terminal ) histidine is a special case because the imidazole is methylated on the n@xmath7 atom , whereas n@xmath8 coordinates to the cu ion .",
    "for the remaining histidine residues , we employed the protonation states hie57 , hid86 , hip87 , hid158 , hip164 and hip201 .",
    "the n@xmath8 atom of hie57 receives a hydrogen bond from the backbone nh group of arg58 , hid86 coordinates to cu through n@xmath7 , hip87 forms a salt - bridge from h@xmath8 to the carboxylate group of asp132 and a hydrogen bond to a crystal water through h@xmath7 .",
    "hid158 forms a hydrogen bond to the carbonyl oxygen of asn92 through h@xmath8 , whereas the n@xmath7 atom accepts a hydrogen bond from the side - chain indole nh group of trp79 .",
    "hip164 and hip201 are solvent exposed on the surface of the protein . with this charge assignment , the total charge of the protein in the resting state ( * 1 * ) was @xmath9 .",
    "the protein contains four cysteine residues that are cross - linked by disulfide bridges in the pairs cys56cys178 and cys97cys101 .",
    "the carboxy - terminal residue gly228 was missing from the x - ray analysis and it was left out from the calculations . the x - ray structure contained one glycerol and four acetate molecules , which were all removed .",
    "restrained electrostatic potential ( resp ) charges for the metal center and its first coordination sphere were obtained by fitting to the electrostatic potential ( esp ) .",
    "the employed structure was taken from the protein ( see figure [ resp_rest_statehopt_for_equi_cut ] ) and only hydrogen atoms were optimized , employing the tpss functional@xcite together with a def2-sv(p ) basis set@xcite .",
    "all calculations in this section were carried out with a development version of turbomole 7.0@xcite ( modified to write out the esp points ) .",
    "the esp points were sampled with the merz ",
    "kollman scheme@xcite and they were employed by resp program ( a part of the amber@xcite package ) to calculate the resp charges .          the system described in section [ setup ] was equilibrated by simulated annealing with the amber@xcite software .",
    "the protein was immersed in a sphere of tip3p water molecules with a radius of 40  , generated by the tleap program in the amber suite .",
    "heavy atoms in the protein and crystal water molecules were kept fixed at their crystal - structure positions . during the first 200 ps",
    ", the system was heated up to 370 k. this was followed by cooling from 370 k to 0 k over 400 ps .",
    "the temperature was regulated with the berendsen thermostat@xcite using a time constant that varied during the simulation : 0.2 ps during the first 200 ps , 1.0 ps during the next 200 ps , 0.5 ps during the following 100 ps and 0.05 ps during the last 100 ps , leading to a total simulation time of 600 ps .",
    "the simulations used a time step of 0.5 fs .",
    "finally , the system was subjected to a 10000-step minimisation .",
    "the equilibrated system was then employed in qm / mm calculations , employing the comqum program.@xcite this program combines the qm software turbomole 7.0@xcite and the mm program amber 14@xcite . in comqum ,",
    "the simulated system is divided into three subsystems , labeled systems 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "system 1 is described with a qm method ( here dft ) .",
    "systems 2 and 3 are both described with an mm force field .",
    "system 2 is defined as all atoms within 6  of any atom in system 1 . in the following ,",
    "we use the label `` free '' for calculations in which the coordinates of atoms in system 2 are optimized . in calculations labeled",
    "`` fixed '' these are kept fixed .",
    "system 3 contains the remaining protein and solvent atoms and are always kept fixed at the equilibrated structure .",
    "when there is a bond between systems 1 and 2 ( a junction ) , the hydrogen link - atom approach was employed : the qm region was capped with hydrogen atoms ( hydrogen link atoms ) , the positions of which are linearly related to the corresponding carbon atoms ( carbon link atoms ) in the full system.@xcite the total energy of the system is calculated as @xmath10 @xmath11 is the qm energy of system 1 , including hydrogen link atoms and a point - charge model of systems 2 and 3 ( with point charges taken from the amber force field and excluding only the carbon link atoms).@xcite @xmath12 is the total mm energy of the full system ( but with the charges of the qm system zeroed ) and @xmath13 is the mm energy of system 1 ( still with zeroed charges ) .     and * * 3**@xmath14 .",
    "model * 2 * employed the same qm system as * 1 * ( but with a reduced copper ion ) and the same qm system is employed for triplet and singlet variants of * 3*. [ qm_systems ] ]    in our study , we focused on the three states * 1 * , * 2 * and * 3 * in figure [ lpmo_active_site ] . for * 3 * we considered two possible isomers with the superoxide ion binding in either the axial or the equatorial position , denoted * * 3**@xmath15 and * * 3**@xmath14",
    ". both isomers of * 3 * may attain either a triplet state or an antiferromagnetically coupled ( open - shell ) singlet state .",
    "the latter was calculated as a broken - symmetry state@xcite .",
    "the qm region always included the first coordination sphere i.e.  the imidazole ring of his86 and the phenol ring of tyr175 , both capped with a hydrogen atom ( replacing c@xmath16 ) .",
    "the whole terminal histidine residue was included , as well as parts of the next amino - acid ( gly2 ; junction at the carbonyl c atom ) .",
    "the qm regions are shown in figure [ qm_systems ] .    for both isomers of * 3",
    "* , we included two solvent molecules in the qm region , in addition to the water molecule coordinating to cu@xmath0 .",
    "this decision was made based on initial calculations , in which they were absent .",
    "the initial calculations showed that the energy difference between the isomers were dominated by van der waals energy from the mm calculations ( amounting to over 80 kj / mol ) . by decomposing the van der waals contributions into contributions to individual residues",
    ", it was shown that the large change in van der waals energy almost exclusively was caused by two solvent water molecules . to shift this large energy contribution to the more accurate qm part of the energy",
    ", we decided to include these two solvent molecules in the qm system .",
    "as expected , this lowered the energy change associated with the mm part to around 17 kj / mol .    in our initial setup",
    ", we noted that the side chain of gln173 was flipped by the maestro preparation tools .",
    "it is located in the second coordination sphere at hydrogen - bonding distance of both tyr175 and one of the cu - bound water molecules ( 2.72.8   distance between the heavy atoms ) . therefore , we decided to perform an optimization both in the flipped ( * 1a * ) and original ( * 1b * ) conformation .",
    "the latter conformation was employed in the study by kim et al.@xcite which was performed in vacuum , but included parts of the second coordination sphere . in conformation",
    "* 1b * and the crystal structure , the side - chain carbonyl group of gln173 can receive in a hydrogen bond from the tyr175 oh group and another from the cu - bound water molecule . in the other conformation ,",
    "the side - chain group instead donates a hydrogen bond to tyr175 , but it can not donate any hydrogen bond to the water molecule . therefore , * 1b * is favored by about 30 kj / mol , even when calculated on a structure equilibrated for the * 1a * state where the hydrogen bonding networks around the gln173 group are somewhat unfavorable for * 1b*. we will therefore focus on the conformation in * 1b * from this point on . to ensure that the hydrogen network around the gln173 was sufficiently relaxed , the structure was re - equilibrated , and the qm / mm optimization of * 1 * was carried out from this re - equilibrated structure .",
    "starting structures for * 2 * and * 3 * were built from * 1 * , by reducing the charge of the qm region ( * 2 * ) and replacing w229 ( * * 3**@xmath15 ) or w230 ( * * 3**@xmath14 ) with .    the structure optimizations employed the def2-sv(p ) basis set@xcite , and the dispersion - corrected tpss - d3 functional@xcite with becke ",
    "johnson damping@xcite .",
    "all energies reported are obtained from these structures as single - point calculations with the more accurate def2-tzvpp basis set@xcite and including the entire protein ( systems 2 and 3 ) , represented by point charges ( the effect of increasing the basis - set is usually around 1 kj / mol for energy differences ) . in the case of * 3 * , we also tried the b3lyp / def2-tzvpp combination ( with the same structures ) . for states * 1 * , * 2 * and * * 3**@xmath14 we further probed the quality of the tpss - d3/def2-sv(p ) structures by increasing the basis set to def2-tzvpd or replacing the tpss - d3 functional with b3lyp - d3@xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that relaxing system 2 was found to have a significant influence on the obtained structure , also within the first coordination sphere .",
    "consequently , we will in general focus on the results obtained with a relaxed system 2 , although we will shortly discuss the effect of relaxing system 2 for intermediates * 1 * and * 2 * in section [ rest_state ] . results with a fixed system 2 will otherwise be included in the tables for comparison , but not thoroughly discussed .      the use of a point - charge model for the environment can be somewhat inaccurate , and for other metalloenzymes it has been advocated to supplement qm / mm energies with calculations with larger qm systems based on qm / mm optimized structures.@xcite .",
    "following refs .",
    "we have therefore defined a large qm system comprised of residues within 5.0  of the active site shown in figure [ lpmo_active_site ] .",
    "in addition , junctions were moved at least three residues away from the active site and we included the only two buried charged residues in the protein , arg157 and glu159 , which form a salt bridge , rather close to the active site ( note that glu159 was included already with the 5  criterium ) . the total system had a charge of + 3 and was comprised of 628 atoms . around this system",
    "we employed a conductor - like screening model ( cosmo)@xcite with a dielectric constant of @xmath17 .",
    "the calculations employed the tpss method and the def2-sv(p ) basis set . the big - qm energy was enhanced with a dft - d3 dispersion correction , calculated for the same big - qm region with becke  johnson damping , third - order terms and default parameters for the tpss functional .",
    "finally , the energies were extrapolated to the def2-tzvpp basis set using two qm calculations on the normal qm system .",
    "we start this section by discussing wheather our computational protocol can reproduce the observed@xcite decrease in coordination number when cu@xmath0 is reduced to cu@xmath1 ( section [ rest_state ] ) . we then proceed to discuss the bound - states ( section [ cuo2-states ] ) .",

    "further , the effect of reducing cu@xmath0 to cu@xmath1 is an elongation of the cu  o bonds of tyr175 and the equatorial water molecule ( w230 ) to 3.0  .",
    "meanwhile , the cu ",
    "o bond to the other water molecule shortens from 2.8 to 2.3  .",
    "thereby , the cu ion becomes essentially four - coordinated , rather than 56-coordinated ( octahedral ) .",
    "considering these small differences in the bonds lengths upon reduction , it is surprising that the calculated distances reproduce the distances in the starting crystal structure ( 2yet@xcite ) so poorly : those to the side - chain imidazole rings are 0.30.5  too short .",

    "however , for the oxidized state ( * 1 * ) , much larger changes are seen : the bond length to tyr175 decreases from 2.80 to 2.34  , whereas that to the axial water molecule increases by almost the same amount , i.e. from 2.28 to 2.83  .",
    "this indicates that the crystal structure represents a predominantly reduced state ( with a long bond to tyr175 ) and that fixing the junction at the c@xmath35 atoms of tyr175 is too restrictive to model the full flexibility of this residue during the reduction .",
    "as will be discussed in section [ cuo2-states ] , it is also too restrictive to describe the distance in intermediate * 3*. therefore , we generally expect large differences for this bond distance when compared to various vacuum studies where it is customary to fix c@xmath36 to its initial location from the crystal structure , and this is indeed the case ( as will be discussed below ) .",
    "the tyr175 residue has recently been speculated to have implications for the lmpo mechanism@xcite and the cu ",
    "o distances are therefore crucial , but it should also be remembered , that axial bonds in cu complexes are weak and extremely flexible ( i.e. the distance to cu can vary much at a minimal expense in energy).@xcite . this is reflected in the rather large variation of these bond lengths in the structures optimized with different basis sets and dft functionals ( up to 0.5  ) and in the various crystal structures ( up to 0.7  ) as can be seen in table [ opt_rest_state ] .    our structures for * 1 * and * 2",

    "the point charges , representing the environment , give a contribution of 15 kj / mol ( the difference between @xmath57 and @xmath49 ) . the electrostatic contribution from the protein",
    "is thus non - negligible , yet not very large .",
    "the contributions from the mm force field is of a similar magnitude , but of an opposite sign , and accordingly the vacuum result ( @xmath49 ) is close to the qm / mm result ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "we additionally carried out a big - qm calculation that included all residues within 5  of the active site .",
    "this gave an energy difference of 77 kj / mol with the def2-sv(p ) basis set .",
    "an estimate of the effect of increasing the basis set size to def2-tzvpp can be obtained from the difference between def2-sv(p ) and def2-tzvpp for the smaller qm system .",

    "it should be noted that the protein significantly influences the structures . as for the resting states * 1 * and * 2 * , previous computational studies on * 3 * imposed restrictions during the structure optimization ( by freezing selected atoms ) to mimic this protein effect .",
    "we compare both isomers with previous calculated results in table [ opt_cuoo_state ] and in both cases we find that the structures differ significantly . in particular , we find large differences in the distance to tyr175 , although it is long in all structures ( 2.572.94   in our structures , but 3.353.82   in the previous studies , see refs .  ) .    both cu@xmath0 and have one unpaired electron .",
    "these two electrons can either couple ferromagnetically in a triplet state or antiferromagnetically in a singlet state .",
    "we have studied both states and it can be seen from table [ opt_cuoo_state ] , that the structures for the two spin states are almost identical .",
    "the energy differences between the two spin states are reported in the lower part of table [ cu_o2_ax_vs_eq ] . for * * 3**@xmath58 , the triplet is most stable .",
    "the energy difference is 13 kj / mol , both with the tpss and b3lyp functionals , and the big - qm result is only 2 kj / mol lower .",
    "this is in reasonable agreement with 19 kj / mol obtained in a previous study@xcite , which is remarkable considering the large differences in the obtained structures .    for the axial isomer ,",
    "the singlet  triplet energy splitting calculated with the qm region and a point - charge model of the environment ( @xmath57 ) are 5 kj / mol for tpss and 1 kj / mol for b3lyp , which means that the two spin states are essentially degenerate .",
    "in fact , adding the mm energy of @xmath6 kj / mol ( giving @xmath59 ) is enough to make the singlet the ground state at the b3lyp level .",
    "thus it is not possible to settle which of the two spin states is most stable for the axial isomer within the accuracy of current methods .",
    "our spin - splitting energy estimates for @xmath60 are somewhat lower than the 19 kj / mol that was obtained in the study by kim et al.@xcite .",
    "we have presented the first qm / mm calculations on a lpmo enzyme , based on the aa9 enzyme from _",

    ", crystallographic and computational studies have suggested that the reduction of * 1 * to * 2 * is accompanied by a decrease in the coordination number of the cu atom .",
    "this is confirmed in our calculations , but the individual structures for * 1 * and * 2 * are rather different from those obtained in previous computational studies that have neglected the protein environment .",
    "we can confirm a previous suggestion that large basis set are required before a significant bond elongation of the axial water molecule ( w229 ) is obtained .",
    "however , even with large basis sets , we find that this water molecule is still weakly coordinated .",
    "we also find large differences in our structures of * 3 * compared to previous calculations on smaller active site models . here",
    "we highlight that * * 3**@xmath14 is not four - coordinate , as has been suggested@xcite ; instead , our structures indicate that the axial water molecule remains coordinated to the cu ion , although with a rather long distance ( 2.242.46  ) , the length of which is sensitive to the dft method and the basis set ( cf .  table [ opt_cuoo_state ] ) . in most suggestions for the reaction mechanism of lpmos",
    ", the substrate has been hydroxylated at either c1 or c4@xcite , starting with a hydrogen abstraction from the substrate .",
    "the cu  superoxide complex , , is involved either by directly abstracting a hydrogen atom from the substrate@xcite or as precursor for an cu@xmath0oxyl radical , which then abstracts the hydrogen@xcite .",
    "the fact that the superoxide can have both axial and equatorial isomers has not been considered in any quantitative studies , although it was noted by beeson et al.,@xcite who suggested that the axial isomer would be unstable , based on a jahn  teller distortion argument .",
    "our calculations show that the axial isomer _ is _ stable , but they also confirm and quantify that the the axial isomer is significantly less stable than the equatorial one ( the difference is more than 60 kj / mol ) .",
    "there are two sources of stabilization of the equatorial isomer .",
    "one is that the equatorial isomer is stabilized by interactions between the superoxide and the second - coordination - sphere gln173 residue ( 2.24   away ) , showing a possible role for this highly conserved residue ( cf .",
    "figure [ opt_cuoo_state_fig ] ) .",
    "another source is that the equatorial coordination of provides better possibility for @xmath61-interaction with the 3d - orbitals .",
    "the involved orbitals for * * 3**@xmath14 are shown in [ mo_plots ] , and more extensive molecular orbital plots for * * 3**@xmath58 and * * 3**@xmath62 are shown in figures s1 and s2 in the supporting information . from these figures",
    "it can be seen that stabilizing d@xmath63-o@xmath63 interactions are completely absent for * * 3**@xmath15 .",
    "mechanistic insight has so far been hampered by the lack of crystal structures including a bound substrate , which is difficult to obtain owing to the low solubility of cellulose and chitin .",
    "however , very recently lpmos that target smaller ( soluble ) oligosacharides as substrates have been discovered and a crystal structure for a ( c4 specific ) lpmo complexed with cellotriose and cellohexose have been reported.@xcite in the lpmo ",
    "oligosacharide complex , a ion occupies the equatorial binding site and it is suggested that this is the binding site of , in agreement with our results .",
    "note however , that the lpmo reported in ref .   has a rather different protein matrix compared to the protein investigated here , and the inclusion of substrate can therefore not be carried out by simple means ( e.g.   overlaying c@xmath64-atoms ) . in this study , we have rather employed a protein that is either identical or bears close resemblence to those used in previous computational studies , and we can thus more directly compare the computational approaches .",
    "the large differences in the obtained structures compared to previous computations strongly indicate that an inclusion of the protein matrix is pivotal .",
    "although the binding of the substrate may affect the active site , the large energy difference between axial and equatorial isomers found here indicates that the equatorial superoxide adduct is the active species or a precursor .",
    "finally , we should still emphasize that we can not at present state rule out that the active species is a cu  oxyl complex as suggested in ref .  .",
    "in future studies , we will include the lpmo  substrate complexes , with the computational protocol employed here .",
    "this will allow us to investigate the reactivity of both the superoxide intermediate ( * 3 * ) and cu  oxyl complexes .",
    "this investigation has been supported by grants from the swedish research council ( project 2014 - 5540 ) and from cost through action cm1305 ( ecostbio ) .",
