    "during the last few years a great deal of attention has been paid to integrable discretizations of nonlinear evolution equations .",
    "the interest is naturally justified by needs of the computational physics @xcite .",
    "one of the purposes of integrable discretization is the construction of a discrete analogue of a continuum model which preserves main features of the last one .",
    "this point becomes especially important when one deals with inhomogeneous models . in that case",
    "even `` the first step '' of the discretization of a one - dimensional nonlinear evolution equation , i.e. discrtization with respect to the spatial coordinate , may introduce qualitatively new features into the dynamics .",
    "so , for instance , in the case of the inhomogeneous nonlinear schrdinger equation a constant force , which linearly depends on the spatial coordinate , results only in the renormalization of the phase and velocity of the one - soliton solution @xcite while the same force leads to oscillations of solitons of the inhomogeneous ablowitz - ladik ( al ) @xcite model : @xmath0 @xmath1 ( here @xmath2 , @xmath3 is a real constant , which from the physical point of view determines the strength of the linear force , a dot stands for the derivative with respect to time , and a bar stands for the complex conjugation ) @xcite . periodic dependence on time",
    "is a property of any solution of ( [ e1a ] ) , ( [ e1b ] ) and it is caused by the discreteness . in the case of the one - soliton solution which reads @xmath4 } e^{i[\\phi(t)-2n\\chi(t - t_0)]}\\ ] ] where @xmath5\\ ] ] @xmath6\\ ] ] @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are real constants , the soliton dynamics has deep analogy with the well known bloch oscillations of an electron in a lattice potential affected by a constant electric field ( due to this reason such behaviour is referred to as bloch oscillations @xcite ) . as it follows from ( [ solit3 ] ) the period of oscillations is given by @xmath10 .",
    "the phenomenon of bloch oscillations becomes especially interesting if one looks for the possibility of integrable discretization of the inhomogeneous al model with respect to time .",
    "indeed , bloch oscillations are characterised by the additional temporal scale , @xmath11 .",
    "this scale is determined by the strength of the force and must lead to some constrains on the step of discretization .",
    "thus the purpose of the present communication is to introduce integrable discretization of the model ( [ e1a ] ) , ( [ e1b ] ) and to obtain conditions on parameters of the discretization which preserve the effect of bloch oscillations in the discrete scheme .",
    "at @xmath12 system ( [ e1a ] ) , ( [ e1b ] ) transforms to the conventional al model which discretization is well known @xcite . in particular , it can be achieved by using the discrete analogue of the zero - curvature condition @xmath13 in the case @xmath14 the same condition involving @xmath15-matrix as follows @xmath16 and @xmath17-matrix having the elements @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a spectral parameter , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are parameters and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) is a step of the discretization , results in the system @xmath27=\\delta_1q(n-1,t+h)e^{ih\\chi ( n-2)}- \\delta_0q(n , t+h)- \\nonumber \\\\ \\alpha_0q(n , t)+\\alpha_1q(n+1,t)e^{-ih\\chi ( n+1)}- % \\nonumber \\\\ \\delta_1 q(n , t+h)d(n , t)- \\alpha_1q(n , t ) a(n+1,t ) \\nonumber \\\\ \\alpha_2q(n-1,t)[e^{-ih\\chi(n+1)}-q(n , t+h)r(n , t+h)]\\lambda(n , t)+ \\nonumber",

    "@xmath38 which allow existence of `` bright '' solitons . hence it will be assumed that @xmath39 .",
    "respectively we have to require @xmath40 @xmath41 notice that ( [ bounda ] ) , ( [ boundd ] ) transform to the zero boundary conditions in the case of the homogeneous al model ( @xmath12 ) @xcite .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) , ( [ e6 ] ) subject to ( [ bounda ] ) , ( [ boundd ] ) allow one to express @xmath36 and @xmath37 through @xmath35 and @xmath34 : @xmath42 @xmath43 here @xmath44 and @xmath45 stand for the right hand sides of the equations ( [ e5 ] ) and ( [ e6 ] ) , correspondingly .",
    "it is to emphasised that formulae ( [ sola ] ) and ( [ sold ] ) do not give yet explicit solutions for @xmath36 and @xmath37 and after substitution into ( [ e3 ] ) , ( [ e4 ] ) represent a source of nonlocality of the discrete scheme .",
    "as it has been shown in @xcite a convenient approach to treat inhomogeneous discrete models is the use of the gauge transformation which allows one to restrict the study only to the temporal behaviour of the scattering data .",
    "the gauge transformation in the discrete case is given by @xmath46 @xmath47    by choosing @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the pauli matrix one reduces @xmath50 to the form which corresponds to the @xmath15-matrix of the underline homogeneous model ( i.e. to the form which does not have explicit dependence on time and can be obtained from ( [ u ] ) by the replacement @xmath51 ) .",
    "then the dependence of the transfer matrix @xmath52 , associated with @xmath50 , on the discrete time is governed by the equation @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a diagonal matrix , @xmath55diag@xmath56 , with the elements @xmath57 @xmath58    let us now assume that @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( it is straightforward to generalise the results to the case @xmath61 where @xmath8 is an arbitrary real constant playing the role of initial moment of time ) .",
    "then the element @xmath62 of the matrix @xmath52 does not depend on @xmath63 ( or @xmath64 ) while for @xmath65 one obtains @xmath66 where @xmath67    in the case of solitonic solutions ( [ b1 ] ) formally solves the discrete cauchy problem since it defines dependence of the scattering data on time and the solution of the eigenvalue problem for the matrix @xmath68 is well known @xcite . below",
    "we concentrate on some `` physical '' consequences of that result .",
    "as it has been mentioned in the introduction each step of discretization can introduce new features into the dynamics ( even in cases of integrable models ) .",
    "one of such features is the oscillatory behaviour of the solutions of the al model affected by the linear force ( bloch oscillations ) .",
    "now we address to the question whether it is possible to preserve such evolution subject to the discretization with respect to time .    to this end",
    "we take into account that periodic behaviour means that there exists a positive integer @xmath69 such that @xmath70 for any @xmath22 ( which can be considered , say , inside the unit circle on the complex plane ) and any @xmath63 .",
    "the period @xmath71 of oscillations is then given by @xmath72 ( evidently @xmath69 is considered to be the smallest possible integer ) .    the discretzation of the homogeneous al model is a three parametic one ( this , in particular , allows one to represent it in a form of a product of the local maps @xcite ) . in the inhomogeneous case the imposed conditions lead to constrains on the parameters . to find them we first consider the limit @xmath73 ( or @xmath74 ) .",
    "then from ( [ theta1 ] ) , ( [ theta2 ] ) , ( [ b2 ] ) , and ( [ c1 ] ) one finds that there must exist relations @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are real prameters connected to @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and the upper index has been attributed to the `` quantized '' phases .",
    "next , the independence of ( [ c1 ] ) on @xmath63 implies @xmath80 which means that @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a positive integer . in other words",
    "the step of the discretization is not arbitrary ( the subindex @xmath82 is introduced to label different discrete values of @xmath25 ) .",
    "physical sense of the last requirement is quite transparent .",
    "recalling that the period of bloch oscillations in the continuous - time model is given by @xmath10 , one concludes that ( [ c2 ] ) means that the period of the bloch oscillations in the discretized model , @xmath71 , is @xmath82 times bigger than the period @xmath11 : @xmath83 and the number @xmath82 is related to the chosen step of discretization @xmath25 . on the other hand rewriting ( [ chi ] ) as @xmath84 one can interpret it as a condition for the discretization step to be comensurable with the period of oscillations .",
    "as it is evident , for the direct coincidence of the result obtained on the discrete lattice with its continuum counterpart one must let @xmath85 .",
    "below we concentrate on this case .",
    "then @xmath86 takes the form @xmath87 where @xmath88 @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "now we consider the unit circle where @xmath91 ( @xmath92 being real ) .",
    "then one can find two possibilities to satisfy the requirement ( [ c1 ] ) .",
    "one simplest solution corresponds to @xmath69 even and @xmath93 ( @xmath94 is an integer )",
    ". then @xmath95 . by the direct algebra",
    "one ensures that this is the degenerated case , when the limiting transition @xmath96 results in a trivial linear equation instead of the al model .",
    "a nontrivial and physically relevant solution corresponds to the case when @xmath97 ( @xmath98 is an integer ) and @xmath99 ( in that case @xmath100 ) .",
    "then @xmath86 which determins evolution of the one - soliton solution associated with the eigenvalue @xmath101 is given by @xmath102 } { 1 + 2(-1)^pa\\sinh[2w - i(\\gamma_{l , n}+2\\theta)]}\\exp\\left(2\\pi i\\frac{l}{m}\\right)\\ ] ]    let us illustrate the discrete - time dynamics on example of the one - soliton solution .",
    "we assume that ( [ c2 ] ) holds .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we let @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "then the one - soliton solution of ( [ e3 ] ) , ( [ e4 ] ) can be written down in the form ( recall @xmath59 ) @xmath105 where @xmath106 - 2i\\chi nmh\\ ] ] @xmath107\\ ] ] comparing these formulae with ( [ solit2 ] ) , ( [ solit3 ] ) one can see that choosing @xmath108 the last ones are obtained by the limiting transition @xmath96 .    to be more specific",
    "we concentrate on @xmath109 which describes evolution of the centre of the soliton . to this end",
    "we represent @xmath110 ( the so chosen step of the discretization satisfies ( [ chi ] ) when @xmath111 is integer ) .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "1 for three values of the parameter @xmath111 displaying different situations : ( a ) when @xmath112 the discrete model exactly reproduces bloch oscillations of the continuous - time model . ( b ) at @xmath113 the evolution of the discrete model is not periodic ( notice that lines in the figure are used for the sake of convenience of presentation : the truth trajectories are sets of points ) .",
    "however , by considering analytic continuation of the solution the periodicity can be considered between discrete time steps @xcite .",
    "( c ) at @xmath114 the period of soliton oscillations is two times more than the period of bloch oscillation of the al model which is obtained by the limiting transition @xmath96 , @xmath115 with @xmath116 ( it is to be mentioned that the minima of the curve ( c ) about @xmath117 and @xmath118 are not numerical zeros ) .",
    "trajectory of the soliton centre corresponding to different steps of discrete time ( a ) @xmath120 , ( b ) @xmath121 , and ( c ) @xmath122 .",
