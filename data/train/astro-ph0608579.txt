    "in recent years , high angular resolution x - ray telescopes make it possible to detect x - ray sources with only a few counts .",
    "this is very different from the optical photometry .",
    "because of these low counts , the poisson processes in corresponding wavebands can not be approximated to gaussian distribution .",
    "therefore the statistics will be very different in some estimations and calculations than used before . in recent years bayesian method",
    "has gained many applications ( e.g. van dyk et al . 2001 and references therein ) since it has more advantages in low count cases than traditional statistics .",
    "hardness ratios are widely used in high energy astrophysics since faint sources with only limited counts can not give any satisfying spectral modeling . in x - ray detection , hardness ratios",
    "are normally used to show spectral properties roughly ( e.g. tennant et al . , 2001 ;",
    "sivakoff , sarazin & carlin 2004 ) .",
    "hardness ratios are usually defined as the ratio of counts in different wavebands ( @xmath1 ) or the ratio of the difference and sum of counts in two wavebands ( @xmath2 ) , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are counts in two wavebands @xmath5 and @xmath6 . on the other hand , for the spectra of x - ray sources , the photoelectric absorption , quantified with the hydrogen column density @xmath7 , can not be neglected .",
    "hydrogen column density contains many kinds of important information , such as the radial distance and the interstellar circumstance of the sources . for low count sources ,",
    "hydrogen column density is hard to know since no reliable spectral fitting can be made .",
    "however interstellar absorption is energy dependent .",
    "consequently the information of hydrogen column density can be drawn from the hardness ratios . in this paper",
    ", we first give a new definition of hardness ratio and its estimation method , and then we discuss the procedure to estimate the hydrogen column density accordingly .",
    "we begin our discussion with the following problem : suppose that one experiment obtained two counts from two different poisson distributions , we need to : ( 1 ) estimate the ratio of the expectation values of the two poisson distributions , and ( 2 ) construct the confidence interval of the ratio .",
    "the expectation values of the poisson processes are just the @xmath0 parameters of the poisson distribution @xmath8 .",
    "therefore the above problem may be formulated as follows : suppose @xmath3 and @xmath4 are two counts corresponding to two different poisson processes @xmath5 and @xmath6 with their parameters as @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively , @xmath11 and its confidence interval needs to be estimated . to solve this problem we first need to derive the distribution of @xmath0 parameter under certain counts , i.e. , the conditional distribution of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , as follows .",
    "@xmath12    first we assume , as a pragmatic convention , a uniform prior for the @xmath0 parameter .",
    "@xmath13 similarly , @xmath14    this continuous distribution is gamma distribution , as shown in fig . 1 .",
    "in addition , we use jeffreys prior ( @xmath15 ) , which may be more advantageous over the uniform prior commonly used , because the inferences derived from jeffreys prior are parameterization - invariant ( see kass & wasserman 1996 for detail of this prior ) . under this prior",
    ", the conditional distribution of @xmath0 is @xmath16 and @xmath17    to account for the background contamination , suppose that @xmath3 is the count corresponding to a poisson process @xmath5 with the addition of a poisson background process @xmath18 , the expectation value of the process @xmath18 is assumed to be known as @xmath19 . according to the properties of poisson processes , the sum of two poisson processes is also a poisson process with the parameter @xmath20 .",
    "so the probability of the total count @xmath21 is @xmath22 .",
    "apply the bayesian assumption and the uniform prior distribution assumption , we obtain the conditional distribution of @xmath9 , as follows .",
    "@xmath23 when @xmath19 is much smaller than @xmath3 , this result is same as equation(2 ) .",
    "also we can obtain the conditional distribution under the jeffreys prior distribution assumption , @xmath24 and it is same as equation(4 ) when @xmath19 is much smaller than @xmath3 .",
    "there are two different definitions of hardness ratio , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in traditional method , the estimate of @xmath27 and @xmath28 are @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively , and the errors are propagated under the gaussian distribution , i.e. , @xmath31    here we propose a method to estimate the hardness ratio based on the bayesian method . both the uniform prior and the jeffreys prior will be used .",
    "when @xmath19 is much smaller than @xmath3 , we use equation(2 ) ( under the uniform prior ) or equation(4 ) ( under the jeffreys prior ) to estimate @xmath25 and @xmath32 .",
    "first we assume the uniform prior of @xmath0 .",
    "for the conditional distribution function of @xmath11 , @xmath33 for the conditional probability density function of @xmath11 , @xmath34 this distribution is shown in fig .",
    "2 when @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "it is easy to verify that the distribution is normalized , @xmath37    for the hardness ratio @xmath28 , the probability distribution of this hardness ratio is given by , @xmath38 the conditional probability density function is given by , @xmath39 this distribution is shown in fig .",
    "3 when @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "it is easy to verify that the distribution is normalized , @xmath40     when @xmath35 , @xmath36.the solid line represents the distribution derived by our proposed method under the uniform prior , the doted line represents the distribution derived by our proposed method under the jeffreys prior , the dashed line represents the gaussian distribution derived by the traditional method . ]        when @xmath35 , @xmath36.the solid line represents the distribution derived by our proposed method under the uniform prior , the doted line represents the distribution derived by our proposed method under the jeffreys prior , the dashed line represents the gaussian distribution derived by the traditional method . ]",
    "similarly , we obtain the conditional probability density function of @xmath27 and @xmath28 under the jeffreys prior assumption as follows , @xmath41 and @xmath42    using the result of @xmath43 and @xmath44 , we can estimate @xmath27 and @xmath28 .    under the uniform prior assumption , since we have only one observation , we take the most probable value as the estimate of @xmath25 , denoted as @xmath45 .",
    "let @xmath46 we obtain , @xmath47 similarly , we obtain the most probable value as the estimate of hr : @xmath48    similarly , we get the most probable value of @xmath27 and @xmath28 under the jeffreys prior assumption , @xmath49 and @xmath50    the highest posterior density ( hpd ) interval is used to give the error bars .",
    "the hpd interval under the confidence level @xmath51 is the range of values which contain a fraction @xmath51 of the probability , and the probability density within this interval is always higher than that outside the interval .",
    "there are other point estimates and error estimates .",
    "for example , the mean value and the equal tailed interval . since the distributions of @xmath27 and @xmath28 are obtained , these alternative estimates can be easily derived .    when @xmath19 can not be ignored , equation ( 6 ) or equation ( 7 ) can be used to estimate @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in this situation ,",
    "it is difficult to give a simple analytic distribution function like equation ( 10 ) or equation ( 13 ) ; in this case , one can only use numerical integration to obtain the distribution of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and then do the estimate .",
    "we use the monte carlo simulations to investigate the statistical properties of our result , and compare them with the traditional methods .",
    "first we set @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "do poisson sampling for @xmath52 times and each time we get @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively .",
    "each time we estimate @xmath27 and @xmath28 using two kinds of methods .",
    "finally we obtain that , for two methods , the mean square error of the point estimate , the coverage rate ( the percentage of times during which the confidence interval contains the real value ) , and the mean confidence interval .",
    "the simulations contain two cases : low counts and high counts . in case 1 , we first set @xmath53 and @xmath54 , then set @xmath55 and @xmath54 . in case 2 , we first set @xmath56 and @xmath57 , then set @xmath56 and @xmath58 .",
    "the confidence level in the simulations is 90% .",
    "the results of the simulations are shown in table 1 .",
    ".statistical properties of our method and traditional method . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ park : tbl : coverage ]    from the simulation results , we notice that our proposed method is more reliable than the traditional method when the counts are low .",
    "the reason is that the traditional method is based on using the gaussian distribution to approach the poisson distribution , which is not reliable when the counts are low .",
    "here we propose a method to estimate the hydrogen column density using data obtained with the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory .",
    "because of the high angular resolution of _ chandra _ , a positive detection of a point source during a survey observation only requires several counts .",
    "therefore our method will be more reliable when estimating the hardness ratio than the traditional method .",
    "the detail procedure of this application can be found in another paper ( wu et al .",
    "the basic idea is introduced as follows .",
    "the basic procedure consists of the following three steps : ( 1 ) calculate the relationship between the hardness ratios and @xmath7 values under certain spectral model ; ( 2 ) estimate hardness ratios according to observed counts in different wavebands ; and ( 3 ) interpolate the @xmath7 values and error intervals from hardness ratios .    according to the most likely physical nature of the sources",
    ", we can assume a spectral model ( e.g. power law with photon index @xmath59 for typical x - ray binaries ) . then we can use _ pimms _ ( http://cxc.harvard.edu/toolkit/pimms.jsp ) tool to calculate the relationship between hydrogen column density and the hardness ratio . using",
    "pimms _ , one can get the count rate in certain energy band under a given x - ray spectrum and hydrogen column density .",
    "the count rate in the given energy band is just the @xmath0 parameter in this energy band ; this was our original movivation of defining the hardness ratios in terms of the @xmath0 parameter .",
    "the calculated @xmath7 ( hydrogen column density )  @xmath28 relationships are shown in fig . 7 for three different energy bands of @xmath5 ( 1 - 3 kev ) , @xmath6 ( 3 - 5 kev ) and @xmath60 ( 5 - 8 kev ) for a _",
    "acis - i observation ( wu et al .",
    "2006 ) respectively : @xmath61 , @xmath62 . from fig",
    ". 7 , we can see that @xmath63 or @xmath64 is more appropriate for @xmath65 or @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "having the value and error interval of @xmath28 , we can finally do linear interpolation on curves in fig . 7 to obtain the value and error interval of hydrogen column density .",
    "first we give the conditional probability distribution of @xmath0 parameter under certain counts in a poisson process using bayesian statistics . according to this result",
    "we derive the probability density function of two kinds of hardness ratios .",
    "we take the most probable values as the estimate of hardness ratios and the hpd intervals as the error intervals .",
    "then we use monte carlo simulations to investigate the statistical properties of our results , and find that our method is more reliable than the traditional method when the counts are low .",
    "finally we show how to estimate the hydrogen column density using hardness ratios .    our method developed in this paper",
    "provides a way to estimate the hydrogen column density of sources which are too faint to do spectral fitting .",
    "however the spectral shape for these sources must be assumed _ a prior_. this method is especially convenient for a sample of faint sources with similar spectra .",
    "after this paper has been submitted initially on 06 - 03 - 29 , we noticed another submitted paper ( park et al .",
    "2006 ) which discusses the same statistical problem as we have done in this paper . in that paper",
    "the authors also used the bayesian method to estimate the hardness ratio , and showed some applications on quiescent low - mass x - ray binaries , the evolution of a flare , etc , therefore justifying the wide range of applications of such a statistical problem . since the strict analytic solution of the hardness ratio distribution does not exist for general situations , the authors suggested methods by monte carlo and numerical integration to obtain the distribution in that paper . in our paper",
    "we find simple analytic solutions of the probability density functions of hardness ratios for the situations in which the background can be ignored",
    ". this will be useful and convenient for some applications , such as _ chandra _ data in which background can be ignored for hardness ratio estimation of point sources .    finally , we note , under the advise of the referee , that in 1980s some studies have been done on the ratio of poisson means both from a frequentist standpoint ( james & roos 1980 ) and from a bayesian standpoint ( helene 1984 and prosper 1985 ) . in this paper",
    "we used the bayesian method under the uniform prior and the jeffreys prior , made extensive comparisons between this method and traditional method , aiming explicitly at applications in astrophysics .",
    "xie chen read the first draft carefully and gave many helpful suggestions , especially on english writing .",
    "we are particularly grateful to the referee for his pointing out relevant historical literature in other fields and suggesting using jeffreys prior .",
    "this study is supported in part by the special funds for major state basic research projects and by the national natural science foundation of china ( project no.10233030 , 10327301 and 10521001 ) .",
