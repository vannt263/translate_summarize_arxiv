    "stability of the equilibrium is a mathematical field more then two centuries old .",
    "indeed , lagrange stated the celebrated lagrange - dirichlet theorem in the eighteenth century , and some so called converses of that statement are still proved nowadays .",
    "so many mathematicians have been interested in stability that we refrain from mentioning them with the exception of the most important , lyapunov , who defended his doctoral thesis `` the general problem of the stability of motion '' in 1892 .",
    "the applications are also countless in mechanics and in most sciences . to start with the rich literature on this matter ,",
    "see arnold et al .",
    "@xcite , meyer et al .",
    "@xcite , and rouche et al .",

    "important mathematical objects related to the instability of the equilibrium are _",
    "asymptotic motions_. before their formal definition , let us mention that the upper position of a simple pendulum , and zero velocity , constitute an unstable equilibrium and its asymptotic motions are neither rotations ( when the pendulum swings around and around ) nor librations ( when it swings back and forth ) , and they stay between the two behaviors .",
    "let us consider a smooth vector field @xmath0 on an open set @xmath1 with an equilibrium point @xmath2 , so @xmath3 .",
    "we say that @xmath4 is an _ asymptotic motion _ in the past to the equilibrium point @xmath5 , if @xmath6 is a non - constant solution to the o.d.e .",
    "@xmath7 such that @xmath8 as @xmath9 . in the sequel",
    "we briefly write ` asymptotic motion ' instead of ` asymptotic motion in the past ' since we are only concerned with this kind of asymptotic motions .",
    "of course the existence of an asymptotic motion implies the lyapunov instability of the equilibrium point .",
    "the basic sufficient condition for the existence of an asymptotic motion is the presence of an eigenvalue of @xmath10 with strictly positive real part , see for instance hartman  @xcite remark to corollary 6.1 , p.  243 .    in this paper",
    "we focus on _ autonomous hamiltonian systems _ so in the sequel @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and the vector field is @xmath14 for some smooth @xmath15 called the hamiltonian function .",
    "our aim is to clarify the concept of _ lyapunov instability without asymptotic motions _ that we briefly call _ weak instability_. this is done by means of some examples .",
    "section [ linear ] deals with linear systems .",
    "of course there is a trivial situation where weak instability appears : the free particle .",
    "the equilibrium is non - isolated and the eigenvalues vanish , the example can be done in one degree of freedom so in dimension 2 .",
    "a more subtle instability of the equilibrium for a linear system is obtained when the eigenvalues are purely imaginary and some jordan blocks have dimension greater than one , of course this can happen only in dimension at least  4 .",
    "the example we are going to see comes from the planar restricted 3-body problem at one of the relative equilibria , the lagrange equilateral points , also called the trojan points , at the critical routh value of the mass ratio of the primaries .",
    "in section  [ nonlinear ] we move on nonlinear systems .",
    "their equilibria can be unstable even if we have stability for the linearized system as the cherry hamiltonian in dimension  4 shows by means of an asymptotic motion .",
    "cherry s system is the third example of this paper , it was published in 1925 and , in the last 20 years , it became important in plasma physics , see pfirsch  @xcite and the references therein .",
    "our fourth example , also in dimension  4 , comes from  @xcite and shows that _ we can have weak instability of an hamiltonian equilibrium which is linearly stable_. some systems , produced by barone - netto and myself  @xcite and @xcite , preceded  @xcite , they give non - hamiltonian examples of weak instability for linearly stable equilibria .",
    "hopefully , the concept of weak instability will stimulate further researches in stability within mathematical physics , together with other fresh notions like the `` weak asymptotic stability '' introduced by ortega , planas - bielsa and ratiu , see  @xcite and the references therein .",
    "our first example is a particle on a straight line under no forces @xmath16 the hamiltonian vector field is @xmath17 it is a linear field with the double eigenvalue @xmath18 .",
    "the integral curves are @xmath19 each @xmath20 is an equilibrium point and its instability can be shown by means of the sequence @xmath21 as @xmath22 .",
    "there are no asymptotic motions .",
    "our second example is the quadratic part of the hamiltonian function of the planar restricted 3-body problem at one of the relative equilibria , the lagrange libration point @xmath23 at the critical routh value of the mass ratio of the primaries . in the sequel @xmath24 , and",
    "@xmath25 the hamiltonian vector field is @xmath26 see @xmath27 and the o.d.e . at the end of p.  256 , with @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and",
    "also @xmath27 at p.  258 in meyer et al .",

    "it is a linear vector field with the double eigenvalues @xmath32 and jordan blocks @xmath33 .",
    "the origin is now the unique equilibrium point .",
    "the function @xmath34 is a first integral .",
    "suppose the integral curve @xmath35 as @xmath36 , then @xmath37 and this fact further implies that @xmath38 , indeed for @xmath39 we have @xmath40 so the integral curve is constant and we do not have asymptotic motions to the equilibrium point .    the origin is an unstable equilibrium point as we can see with @xmath41 for w @xmath42 as @xmath43 .    incidentally , in connection with the nonlinear 3-body problem which has the hamiltonian vector field defined by   as linearization at @xmath23 , the book @xcite at the end of sec",
    ".  13.6 says that in 1977 two papers claimed to have proved the stability of the equilibrium , however one proof is wrong and the other is unconvincing .",
    "the last sentence is : `` it would be interesting to give a correct proof of stability in this case , because the linearized system is not simple , and so the linearized equations are unstable '' .",
    "next , the famous cherry hamiltonian system shows that the equilibrium can be unstable even if it is stable for the linearized system , briefly even if it is _",
    "linearly stable_. in cherry  @xcite p.  199 , or",
    "in whittaker @xcite p.  412 , we can see the hamiltonian function @xmath44 @xmath45 the hamiltonian vector field , written as a column vector , is @xmath46 the linearized vector field @xmath47 is obtained for @xmath48 .",
    "the origin is stable for the linearized systems which consists of two harmonic oscillators : @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "the eigenvalues are distinct @xmath51 , @xmath52 . however , the origin is lyapunov unstable for the vector field   whenever @xmath53 since it has the following asymptotic motion defined for @xmath54 @xmath55          our final example shows that the origin is an unstable equilibrium point which is linearly stable and has no asymptotic motions for the system defined by @xmath56 it is a particular case of the following hamiltonian function introduced in  @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 on a neighborhood of @xmath18 .",
    "the hamiltonian vector field is @xmath59 the origin is stable for the linearized system which consists of two harmonic oscillators : @xmath60 , @xmath61 . in this case",
    "the eigenvalues are double @xmath62 however the jordan blocks are one - dimensional .    the subsystem of the first and last canonical equations @xmath63 separates .",
    "if we take a solution @xmath64 of this subsystem and plug @xmath65 into the second and third canonical equations , we then get the equations of variation of along the solution @xmath64 . this is why the function in formula is called _ variation - like hamiltonian _ in the title of this subsection .        in spite of this fact ,",
    "the origin is unstable for for most functions @xmath69 as above .",
    "theorem  3.3 in @xcite proves that stability is equivalent to the isochrony of the periodic solutions of the subsystem in a neighborhood of @xmath70 , and this implies the isochronous periodicity of all integral curves of in a neighborhood of @xmath71 .",
    "moreover , corollary  2.3 in @xcite for a smooth @xmath69 provides @xmath72 as the simplest necessary condition for ( local isochrony and then ) stability .",
    "so the choice @xmath73 of the hamiltonian   gives instability for all @xmath53 . in figure",
