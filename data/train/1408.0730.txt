    "_ mesoscopic _ electronic systems , those with physical dimensions comparable to the fermi wavelength @xmath4 , can display a variety of striking effects such as size quantisation , ballistic electron transport and quantum interference .",
    "quantum interference effects such as aharonov - bohm oscillations , weak localisation and universal conductance fluctuations ( ucfs ) are all direct manifestations of phase coherent electron transport .",
    "hence these are dependent on an additional lengthscale , namely the phase coherence length @xmath5 over which the electron loses memory of its phase through inelastic processes .",
    "ucfs are aperiodic but reproducible features in the electrical conductivity @xmath6 as a function of an external parameter such as the magnetic field @xmath7 and are a consequence of the non - self - averaging nature of electron interference over lengthscales comparable to @xmath5 .",
    "the resulting fluctuations are not limited to @xmath6 but will tell on other transport parameters such as the thermopower as well .",
    "the thermopower or seebeck coefficient @xmath0 of a system is defined as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the voltage that develops between its end due to an imposed temperature difference @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath6 are related by the mott formula @xcite :    @xmath11    here @xmath12 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath13 is the temperature , @xmath14 the electronic charge , @xmath15 the energy of the system and @xmath16 the chemical potential . indeed ,",
    "` universal thermopower fluctuations ' have been experimentally demonstrated in quantum wires @xcite , quantum dots @xcite and , more recently , in other mesoscopic structures @xcite .",
    "while mesoscopic fluctuations have been reported most often as a function of @xmath7 , they are expected @xcite and seen @xcite even as a function of @xmath16 .",
    "the relative magnitude of the @xmath0-fluctuations can be much larger than those in @xmath6 by virtue of the derivate relation in equation [ mottformula ] .",
    "lesovik and khmelnitskii ( henceforth lk ) show @xcite that precisely for this reason , the mesoscopic contribution to the thermopower can be exceedingly large and either positive or negative .",
    "consequently , they can potentially swamp the regular , ` bulk ' contribution even causing sign reversals in @xmath0 .",
    "the important difference between such fluctuations and thermopower sign - reversals resulting from coulomb blockade @xcite is that the former occur in the high - conductivity regime @xmath17 , while the latter become significant at @xmath18 .",
    "recently some of us reported @xmath0 measurements in low - density two - dimensional electron gases ( 2degs ) of mesoscopic dimensions @xcite as a function of density @xmath2 and temperature @xmath13 .",
    "specifically , @xmath0 displayed large oscillations and even sign changes as the 2deg density @xmath2 was varied whereas the electrical resistivity @xmath19 was completely monotonic .",
    "however , these measurements focused on the low - conductivity regime of the samples ( 300@xmath20 ) , where many - body effects suppressed the strong localisation ( see also refs  @xcite and @xcite ) and it is not clear whether weak localisation , and therefore , mesoscopic fluctuations are to be expected . in this work",
    "we measure @xmath0 in similar samples while concentrating specifically on the medium-@xmath21 range around the onset of @xmath0-oscillations where , in principle , ucfs are expected .",
    "we perform a statistical analysis of these oscillations and examine whether they are consistent with the mesoscopic fluctuations described by lk .",
    "the remainder of the article is structured as follows : section 2 describes the experimental system and measurement setup , section 3 presents the experimental data and statistical analysis and section 4 presents a discussion and concluding remarks .",
    "our experiments are all performed at @xmath13 = 0.3  k in gaas - based 2degs with an as - grown mobility of 220  m@xmath22/vs at @xmath2 = 2.1@xmath2310@xmath24  m@xmath25 .",
    "we use a wet etch to define a conducting mesa and deposit ohmic contacts to perform electrical and thermoelectric measurements .",
    "the mesoscopic device d ( see figure 1 ) is defined by a metallic gate of lithographical dimensions l@xmath23w",
    "= @xmath26 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows a schematic representation of the device .",
    "in addition to d , there are four gate - defined bar - gates ( bgs ) that serve as a pair of thermometers to measure the local electron temperature @xmath27on either side of d  @xcite .",
    "to measure @xmath0 we heat one end of the device with an ac heating current @xmath28 = 4  @xmath16a at frequency @xmath29 = 11  hz .",
    "@xmath9 is measured using a lock - in amplifier at 2@xmath29 as shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the local electron temperatures on either side of the device @xmath30 and @xmath31 are measured using bar - gate pairs bg@xmath32 and bg@xmath33 , respectively .",
    "details of this measurement procedure can be found in ref .",
    "@xmath0 is then calculated as @xmath34 .",
    "we measure the resistance @xmath1 using a standard four - probe lock - in technique with a constant current @xmath35 = 1  na at a frequency @xmath36 = 7  hz . however , the results are unaffected upon increasing @xmath35 by an order of magnitude to 10  na . in all our measurements @xmath9 and @xmath1 are measured simultaneously .",
    "@xmath10 is 20  mk in all the measurements reported here .",
    "as a function of @xmath2 ( bottom axis ) and @xmath37 ( top axis ) .",
    "the inset shows the same data on a linear scale where the sign - reversals of @xmath0 are clearly visible .",
    "figure 2b shows @xmath1 measured simultaneously with @xmath0 over the same @xmath2 .",
    "blue and red traces correspond to devices with l = 2  @xmath16 m and 3  @xmath16 m , respectively and the arrow marks the density below which thermopower oscillations are present.,width=576 ]    figures [ fig2]a and [ fig2]b show @xmath0 and @xmath1 as functions of @xmath2 for two different samples labelled d1 and d2 . the top horizontal axis in figure [ fig2]a shows the interaction parameter @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the effective bohr radius in gaas @xmath40 11  nm .",
    "d1 has l = 2  @xmath16 m and d2 has l = 3  @xmath16 m .",
    "figure [ fig2]a also shows @xmath3 for @xmath41    @xmath42    here @xmath43 is the inelastic scattering time and @xmath44  1 .",
    "it is seen that @xmath0 , while agreeing closely with @xmath3at high @xmath2 , shows a sudden departure from mott - like behaviour at @xmath45  2.5@xmath2310@xmath46  m@xmath25 with strong oscillations and even sign reversals .",
    "the sign reversals are seen most clearly in the inset to figure [ fig2]a which also serves to distinguish the smooth @xmath0 oscillations from the measurement noise ( @xmath4710  @xmath16v / k which corresponds to a voltage uncertainty @xmath48 of 200  nv ) , the latter being most prominent in the range @xmath49 2@xmath2310@xmath46  m@xmath25 .",
    "it is worth emphasising that the former are large oscillations and completely reproducible between @xmath2 sweeps ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) , while the latter correspond to measurement noise . in the same @xmath2-range",
    ", @xmath1 grows monotonically in both devices except for some broad features accentuated by the log scale which , importantly , bear no obvious correlation to the oscillations in @xmath0 .",
    "hence , this very unusual behaviour can not simply be reconciled with @xmath0 oscillations in a disordered 2deg that arise , say , due to coulomb blockade resulting from the 2deg fragmenting into charge puddles .",
    "traces vertically offset to each other .",
    "the inset shows the corresponding @xmath1 traces .",
    "all data are taken at @xmath13 = 300  mk .",
    "figure 3(b ) shows five @xmath50 traces , again , with a relative vertical offset , at five different @xmath13 and concentrating on high-@xmath2 ( boxed region in the inset to figure 3(a ) ) . the inset shows the scale of fluctuations @xmath51 as a function of @xmath13.,width=576 ]    in figure  [ fig3]a we plot five consecutive @xmath0 traces taken at @xmath13 = 0.3  k vertically offset relative to each other . in the inset we plot the simultaneously measured @xmath50 corresponding to each @xmath52 trace , again , with a relative vertical offset .",
    "these figures firmly establish both the reproducible nature of the @xmath0 oscillations as well as the smooth character of @xmath50 . in figure",
    "[ fig3]b we investigate whether the @xmath1 data at high-@xmath2 contain any signatures of ucfs .",
    "we see that in the five @xmath50 traces at 0.3  k @xmath53 1.5  k , vertically offset relative to each other by 100  @xmath54 , there are no reproducible features but a fluctuation level that has no obvious @xmath13-dependence .",
    "this becomes clearer in the inset where we plot @xmath55 , the magnitude of fluctuations in @xmath1 as a function of @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath55 is defined as the standard deviation in @xmath1 after subtracting a smooth background .",
    "the dependence of @xmath55 on @xmath13 is not consistent with weak localisation and @xmath55 simply represents the experimental noise levels .    .",
    "the grey arrows indicate the minimum in each instance . the inset shows the same data without normalisation.,width=576 ]",
    "we now return to the @xmath0 oscillations and to analyse their statistical nature , we look at the autocorrelation of @xmath0 . in figure  [ fig4 ]",
    "we plot @xmath56 normalised to @xmath57 = 1 . here",
    "the angular brackets represent an average over @xmath2 and @xmath58 is defined as @xmath0 - @xmath3 .",
    "the correlator is defined with @xmath59 in the denominator rather than @xmath60 ) to avoid divergences at the zero - crossings of @xmath52 and also to make a quantitative comparison with the lk theory ( see next section ) .",
    "the inset shows the data without normalising and error bars as estimated from the standard deviation in the data .",
    "we find that @xmath61 in both devices agree quantitatively and are consistent with an initial decay @xmath62 .",
    "furthermore , there is a minimum and subsequent maximum that occur in the vicinity of @xmath63 2.5@xmath2310@xmath64  m@xmath25 .",
    "these features suggest a degree of periodicity in the @xmath0 oscillations which are further reflected in the fourier transforms ( fts ) of the data shown in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "the grey arrows mark the ft peaks which correspond to periodicities of @xmath63  4.2@xmath2310@xmath65  m@xmath25 and 2.7@xmath2310@xmath65  m@xmath25 for d1 and d2 , respectively .",
    "we note that figure  [ fig4 ] shows several features at @xmath66-values larger than 5@xmath2310@xmath67  m@xmath25 which can be correlated to peaks in the ft in figure  [ fig5]a .",
    "however , these must be taken with caution due to the lack of sufficient statistics . in figure",
    "[ fig5]b we plot the ft of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath37 .",
    "interestingly we note that the periodicities correspond to @xmath68 0.4 - 0.5 , reminiscent of conductance oscillations seen in disordered silicon inversion layers  @xcite .",
    "the strong oscillations in @xmath0 without corresponding features in @xmath1 is extremely surprising and signifies a breakdown of the mott formula ( equation [ mottformula ] ) .",
    "while there are instances where this is expected ( see section 5 ) , we first ascertain whether the mesoscopic nature of the 2deg has a role to play in the observed experimental data .",
    "as mentioned earlier , mesoscopic fluctuations are necessarily present in all transport parameters of mesoscopic samples .",
    "however , oscillations in @xmath0 can be significantly amplified compared to those in @xmath1 due to the derivative relation between them .",
    "conversely , therefore , one can expect situations where @xmath0 oscillations are visible but immeasurably small in @xmath1 and such situations would be wrongly perceived as a breakdown of the mott relation .",
    "motivated by this we now investigate whether the observed oscillations are consistent with the lk - type oscillations  @xcite mentioned earlier .",
    "lk calculated the mesoscopic contribution to @xmath0 of a sample of small size as a function of @xmath16 and the magnetic field @xmath7 .",
    "using the mott formula ( equation  [ mottformula ] ) they then showed that this contribution can be positive or negative and even exceed the regular term in magnitude , potentially resulting in sign reversals of @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , they constructed and evaluated the correlation function : @xmath69 . here",
    "@xmath70 is a scaling function , @xmath71 is the time taken for an electron to diffuse across the sample of length @xmath72 and is given by @xmath73 , with @xmath74 being the electron diffusivity and @xmath75 . at @xmath76 = 0 and low @xmath13 this correlation functions is essentially identical to the correlation function evaluated in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "the low-@xmath13 requirement is in order to approximate @xmath16 by the fermi energy @xmath77 and this is met in our experimental results since @xmath78 0.25 in the @xmath2-range being considered .",
    "lk predict a universal form for the autocorrelation function which they numerically show to initially decay and then go through a minimum .",
    "this is in striking agreement with the result in figure  [ fig4 ] in that the data from both devices has the same initial @xmath79 decay and a clear minimum .",
    "additionally , lk consider the cross - correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 : @xmath80 , where @xmath55 are fluctuations about the mean @xmath1 .",
    "lk show @xmath81 to be 0 at @xmath82 = 0 , i.e. , oscillations in @xmath0 and @xmath1 at the same value of chemical potential are uncorrelated , but gradually grow as a function of @xmath82 and ultimately go through a maximum .",
    "while the statement that @xmath0 and @xmath1 oscillations at a given @xmath16 are uncorrelated seems consistent with a visual inspection of the data in figure  [ fig2 ] , a quantitative comparison reveals discrepancies with the lk picture .",
    "first , at the point where @xmath0 oscillations set in , there are absolutely no oscillations in @xmath1 ( see figures  [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] ) , thereby trivially rendering @xmath83 zero . in this region ,",
    "@xmath84 3  k@xmath54 and therefore the expected magnitude of @xmath85 350  @xmath54 .",
    "this is well within the limit of accuracy even if , considering the wide aspect ratio of the sample , we divide the expected @xmath55 by a factor @xmath86  2 . given the above estimate for @xmath55 , it is then reasonable to ask why ucfs are absent in the first place .",
    "while this is unclear at the moment , a possible explanation lies in the nature of the disorder being sampled by the device . the earlier experiments on mesoscopic 2degs  @xcite that motivated the present studies were performed especially to circumvent the long - range disorder due to remote ionised dopants in the host gaas wafer .",
    "the residual short - scale ` white ' disorder would then restore the self - averaging nature of the electron paths , leading to the absence of ucfs .",
    "we hope to verify this argument by examining whether ucfs appear in larger mesoscopic samples .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that preliminary results of @xmath0 and @xmath1 as a function of @xmath7 also indicate the absence of ucfs .",
    "not only is this consistent with with the arguments in the previous paragraph , it is another discrepancy between the experimental data and the lk picture .",
    "the lk analysis predicts similar cross - correlation and autocorrelation functions as @xmath7 is tuned , but we observe no reproducible oscillations in @xmath0 or @xmath1 as functions of @xmath7 , or at least no oscillations ( other than the @xmath87-periodic shubnikov - de haas oscillations ) comparable in magnitude to those observed by tuning @xmath2 .",
    "this data will be presented in a separate report .",
    "to summarise , we find some aspects of the data to be consistent with oscillations due to the mesoscopic nature of the device , but several others that are at odds with it .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath0 oscillations persist to much lower @xmath2 even up to @xmath84  100  @xmath88  @xcite , a regime in which there is no reason to expect lk - type oscillations . while the oscillations may indeed be related to those seen in ref .",
    "@xcite , there have recently been several theoretical reports describing situations where the mott relation ( equation  [ mottformula ] ) breaks down .",
    "these include the vicinity of a quantum critical point  @xcite , proximity to a lifshitz transition  @xcite , and , remarkably , even far away from a critical point  @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have observed intriguing oscillations in the thermopower @xmath0 of mesoscopic 2degs and analysed their statistical nature .",
    "we find that the experimental data from the 2 devices measured suggests several common aspects in the nature of oscillations despite the devices being of dissimilar sizes : 1 .",
    "the decay of the autocorrelation function of @xmath0 is consistent with a @xmath79 dependence ; 2 .",
    "the minima and maxima of the autocorrelation in the two devices occur at approximately similar locations ; and 3 .",
    "the oscillations have a degree of periodicity as revealed by the fourier transform .",
    "we have compared these results to the oscillations predicted by lesovik and khmelnitskii in ref .",
