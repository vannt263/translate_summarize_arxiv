    ", we can eventually express the energy asymmetry in one channel and the top - angle asymmetry in the other channel in terms of forward - backward asymmetries in the @xmath5 rest frame , which are related by parton crossing , @xmath299 these results are visualized in figure  [ fig : a - diff_restframes ] .",
    "the energy asymmetry @xmath128 in the @xmath6 channel ( left , plain ) and the top - angle asymmetry @xmath133 in the @xmath7 channel ( right , plain ) can both be related to the forward - backward asymmetry of the gluon in the @xmath5 rest frame ( bold dotted ) .",
    "the smallness of the top - angle asymmetry in the @xmath7 channel has been mentioned previously for inclusive top - pair production in the literature .",
    "it can now be ascribed to the small energy asymmetry in the @xmath6 channel , since both asymmetries are related by parton crossing .",
    "the different shapes of the jet angular distributions are due to the kinematic configurations : in the @xmath6 channel , @xmath23 is the angle of the gluon - jet with respect to the incident quark , whereas in the @xmath7 channel , it is the angle of the quark - jet . in particular , the energy asymmetry in the @xmath6 channel is antisymmetric and changes its sign at @xmath137 .",
    "this is not the case for the top - angle asymmetry in the @xmath7 channel , where the angle between the incident quark and the gluon is fixed to @xmath105 .",
    "the magnitudes of @xmath300 and @xmath301 differ mainly because of the soft enhancement for @xmath45 in the @xmath6 channel , which is absent in the @xmath7 channel .",
    "the same connection holds true for the energy asymmetry in the @xmath7 channel ( right , dashed ) and the top - angle asymmetry in the @xmath6 channel ( left , dashed ) .",
    "both asymmetries can be traced back to the forward - backward asymmetry of the quark in the @xmath5 rest frame ( fine dotted ) .",
    "thus , the sizeable energy asymmetry in the @xmath7 frame is due to the fact that the top - angle asymmetry in the @xmath6 channel ( which is connected to the incline asymmetry ) provides the dominant contribution to the charge asymmetry .",
    "these findings confirm that the incline asymmetry in the @xmath6 channel and the energy asymmetry in the @xmath7 channel capture most of the differential charge asymmetry in both channels .",
    "one might wonder , why we derived the correspondence between the energy asymmetry and the top - angle asymmetry , rather than the incline asymmetry .",
    "as was mentioned at the end of section  [ subsec : kinematics ] , the incline asymmetry and the energy asymmetry form a `` perfect match '' , in the sense that they probe complementary parts of the charge asymmetry in the @xmath6 channel .",
    "it is not possible to translate this complementarity to the @xmath7 channel .",
    "a lorentz boost into the @xmath302 rest frame , which would mimic a @xmath6 initial state , is kinematically prohibited .",
    "the incline asymmetry can be defined in the @xmath5 rest frame via @xmath303 , where @xmath304 is the inclination angle between the plane spanned by the top quark and the incoming gluon and the plane spanned by the quark - jet and the incoming gluon . due to the asymmetric jet kinematics in the @xmath7 channel ,",
    "the jet distribution of @xmath305 is not flat as in the @xmath6 channel , but peaks in the forward direction .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath305 is similar to the energy asymmetry @xmath128 in the @xmath7 channel .",
    "we consider the energy asymmetry a more suitable observable than the incline asymmetry in the @xmath5 rest frame , because the former does not rely on the collinear region .",
    "furthermore , the energy asymmetry can be easily formulated in the partonic cm frame and does not rely on the direction of the incoming gluon , contrary to the incline asymmetry in the @xmath5 rest frame .",
