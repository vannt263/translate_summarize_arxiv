    "astronomical observations and detailed astrophysical considerations strongly support the existence of black hole candidates having masses in the range from few @xmath9 to few @xmath10 . in order to make sure that they actually are black holes as postulated in general relativity ( gr )",
    ", we should prove that at least in one case the black hole no - hair theorems are satisfied .    according to the black hole",
    "no - hair theorems , an electrically neutral rotating black hole in gr is completely described by its mass @xmath11 and angular momentum @xmath12 ( israel 1967 , 1968 , carter 1970 , hawking 1971 , 1972 , see misner , thorne and wheeler 1973 for discussions ) .",
    "this implies that the multipole moments , required to specify the external metric of a black hole , are fully expressible in terms of @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in the case of a kerr black hole , characterized by the kerr parameter @xmath13 , its dimensionless quadrupole parameter @xmath14 is uniquely defined by @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the quadrupole moment of the black hole ( thorne 1980 ; thorne , price and macdonald 1986 ) .",
    "recently , the first attempt to probe the black hole no - hair theorems was made by valtonen et al .",
    "( 2010 ) using the available optical observations of the bl lacertae object oj287 .",

    ", width=170 ]    a simple model for oj287 involves a secondary black hole orbiting a more massive primary black hole in an eccentric orbit having a periodicity of about 12 years , while the 60 year period arises from the associated periastron precession @xcite .    )",
    "data points are shown .",
    "there is a big `` hump '' lasting about one year and a `` spike '' at 2007 september 13 lasting only a few days .",
    "it is the `` spikes '' of the light curve that are used to determine the times of impact on the accretion disk and then to calculate the orbit of the secondary.[fig2],width=170 ]    in principle , one could imagine many different binary models that would satisfy these requirements .",
    "however , there exists a third requirement which nails down the model .",
    "it is related to the observed double peak structure in the light curve of oj287 , with the two peaks separated by one to two years and the pair occuring approximately in every 12 years .",
    "these observations are interpreted as being due to the double impact of the secondary black hole on the accretion disk of the primary @xcite .",
    "the model was able to predict the 2007 september 13 sharp outburst to the accuracy of one day ( valtonen 2007 , 2008 , valtonen et al .",
    "2008 ) .    in describing the full light curve of oj287",
    ", one must also calculate the indirect effects of the binary action on the accretion flow .",
    "after the orbit is fully determined by the sharp impacts and the related short but bright outbursts , it is straightforward to calculate the more gentle rise and fall of the light curve arising from variations in the accretion flow . thus the rest of the optical light curve was also predicted with fair accuracy ( sundelius et al .",
    "1997 , valtonen et al .",
    "it is a relatively simple matter to separate these two kinds of flux variations by their quite different time scales ( valtonen et al .",
    "2011 , see figure 2 ) .",
    "these investigations give us the confidence to employ the binary black hole model of oj287 to test gr .",
    "the first orbit model of lehto & valtonen ( 1996 ) made use of 5 outbursts , giving 4 independent intervals of time .",
    "they allow a unique solution of 4 orbital parameters , the mass of the primary @xmath19 , the eccentricity of the orbit @xmath20 , the precession rate of the major axis of the orbit @xmath21 , and a constant @xmath22 specifying the oriention of the orbit at some initial moment of time .",
    "after the predicted 2005 outburst was observed , a new solution was calculated using 6 outbursts , allowing the determination of 5 parameters ( valtonen 2007 ) .",
    "the new additional parameter is the thickness of the accretion disk ( scale height @xmath23 au ) , while the precession rate was updated to @xmath24 .",
    "the timing of the 2007 outburst together with some new historical data allowed a solution using 9 outbursts , and solving for 8 parameters ( valtonen et al .",
    "these 9 outbursts all follow the basic light curve shape of figure 3 , with a rapid rise to the maximum and then a slower decay to pre - outburst level .",
    "the time scales of the outbursts follow the dependence on the impact distance established by lehto and valtonen ( 1996 ) .",
    "they form a very well defined sequence .",
    "there are no cases when an outburst in this sequence was expected but was not observed .",
    "all missing members are at times when there were no observations .",
    "neither are there any extra unexplained members of this sequence .",
    "the new parameters are the spin of the primary black hole , with @xmath25 , the mass of the secondary @xmath26 , and @xmath1 which is desribed below .",
    "parallel to the increase in the number of outbursts in the solution , the number of post - newtonian ( pn ) terms was increased in calculating the acceleration between the binary components .",
    "valtonen et al .",
    "( 2010 ) include the dominant order general relativistic and classical spin - orbit coupling , which is required in order to relate the dimensionless quadrupole parameter @xmath14 of the primary to its kerr parameter .",
    "they write @xmath27 and let @xmath1 be among the 8 parameters of the solution .",
    "its value was determined as @xmath3 .",
    "valtonen et al .",
    "( 2010 ) noted that the timing of the next outburst in 2015 should help to improve the accuracy of the @xmath13 estimate to about @xmath28 .",
    "this conclusion along with the fact that the mass of the primary is determined with the accuracy of @xmath29 prompted us to explore the ways of testing the no - hair theorem at the @xmath30 level in _ the current decade _ by measuring @xmath1 more accurately .",
    "allows applications to slower or faster outbursts since the outburst speed is a function of impact distance measured from the primary black hole .",
    "the parameter @xmath31 has the value 3 .",
    "[ fig3],width=288 ]    in the literature , there exits a number of proposals to test the black hole no - hair theorems , plausible in the next decade with the help of electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations .",
    "the scenarios include radio timing of eccentric millisecond binary pulsars having an extreme kerr black hole as a companion ( wex and kopeikin 1999 ) and observing several stars orbiting the massive galactic center black hole at milliarsec distances with infrared telescopes capable of doing astrometry at @xmath32arcseconds level @xcite .",
    "further , lisa observations of gravitational waves from extreme mass ratio inspirals @xcite and quasi - normal ringdown phases associated with massive black hole mergers @xcite will also try to validate black hole no - hair theorems .",
    "it has also been argued that the imaging of accretion flow around sgr a * , if its kerr parameter is not close to one , may allow the testing of the no - hair theorems in the near future @xcite .",
    "the test relies on the argument that a bright emission ring characterizing the flow image will be elliptical and asymmetric if the theorems are violated .",
    "johannsen and psaltis ( 2011 ) further explore the possibility of detecting modes of quasiperiodic variability in accretion disks as test cases for the no - hair theorems .    in what follows ,",
    "we briefly summarize our approach , detailed in valtonen et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and list the improvements desirable for the test .",
    "we then identify by timing experiments those impact outbursts ( historical and future ) that will be crucial to constrain the @xmath1 value .",
    "finally , we discuss observational requirements to achieve it .",
    "[ fig4],width=288 ]    in order to obtain the best timing , we construct a standard outburst light curve ( figure 3 ) .",
    "it is based on the observations of the 2007 outburst which was monitored throughout the outburst both in total optical brightness and polarization ( valtonen et al . 2008 ) .",
    "no such light curve was previously available .",
    "these data allow us to separate the underlying bremsstrahlung emission ( unpolarized ) from the polarized flares .",
    "we model the underlying light curve in three separate sections using analytical functions . from the time zero to time",
    "2.59 days we use a rising power - law form , @xmath33 from day 2.59 to day 3.35 we use a linear rise , @xmath34 and beyond day 3.35 we assume a decaying power - law form @xmath35 the flux is in mjy , and @xmath36 is the time measured from the beginning of the outburst .    even though the standard light curve is adopted from observations , the three sections may be justified as follows : at time zero the optical depth of the radiating bubble equals unity and we start see to the interior of the bubble . the optical depth decreases and larger and larger volumes of the bubble come to view . at day 2.59 approximately half of the volume",
    "is visible , and thereafter also the rest of the volume produces emission as fast as the visibility front advances into the bubble .",
    "this stage happens quickly , in the light travel time of the bubble . at the third stage",
    "the flux from the bubble decreases as the radiating plasma cools adiabatically .",
    "there is a free parameter @xmath37 in the formulae which contracts or stretches the outburst time scale .",
    "this is necessary since the time scale is a function of the impact distance , measured from the primary black hole .",
    "this function is given in eq .",
    "12 and in table 3 of lehto @xmath38 valtonen ( 1996 ) .    to illustrate the procedure ,",
    "let us take the light curve of the 1983 outburst .",
    "figure 4 shows the observed points overlaid by the standard light curve .",
    "the value @xmath37 is six , the best fitting value which is also in agreement with lehto @xmath38 valtonen ( 1996 ) time scale .",
    "the goodness of fit is judged by minimizing the @xmath39 .",
    "the standard light curve is shifted left - to - right in order to indentify the beginning of the outburst , by minimizing the @xmath39 of the difference between observations and the standard curve .",
    "this produces a single value for @xmath40 , the beginning of the outburst . in order to see how uncertain this value is",
    ", we have varied the observed flux values by @xmath41 mjy in random uniform way .",
    "we have also varied the number of points included in the fit , starting from 40 points and adding up to 48 more points to the tail . in this way",
    "we get 48 values of @xmath40 .",
    "their distribution is centered on 1982.964 and it fits reasonably well with a gaussian of @xmath42 yr .    , width=288 ]    the same procedure was applied to other eight outburst light curves .",
    "the results are shown in table 1 .",
    "notice that the error limits are generally a little narrower than in valtonen et al .",
    "( 2010 ) . in that paper only the first section of the standard light curve was used .",
    "thus the use of the full light curve produces some improvement in timing .",
    ".outburst times with estimated uncertainties .",
    "these are starting times of the outbursts[outburst ] . [ cols= \" < , > \" , ]     , width=288 ]",
    "the first outburst which we studied is the 1934 outburst , with the expected starting time 1934.3439 if @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the correlation of the starting time with @xmath1 is so weak that this outburst is of no interest in determining @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , there are no data in the historical light curve yet to verify this outburst .",
    "the 1935 outburst is no better in this respect .",
    "it is expected at 1935.3939 , with little correlation with @xmath1 .",
    "this outburst has not been verified either in the observational record .    ,",
    "width=288 ]    the next interesting outburst should have taken place in 1959 . here",
    "we expect quite a strong correlation between the start of the outburst and @xmath1 ( figure 8) .     and the starting time of the 1971 outburst @xmath40 ( labelled @xmath45 when @xmath43 . the functional form of the correlation is given inside the figure .",
    "there is also a correlation with the @xmath46 such that the line of regression is shifted to the right in the figure by one unit for a decrease of @xmath46 by 0.01 units .",
    "five units in the time axis corresponds to 4.4 hours .",
    "[ fig11],width=288 ]    we see from figure 8 that the difference in the starting time of the outburst by 15 units corresponds to the range of 0.8 in @xmath1 . since 15 units in the figure corresponds to 13 hours , with good timing , say with 5 hour accuracy , it should be possible to determine the @xmath1 value at the level of @xmath47 if a fair number of detections are found in the historical plate collections .",
    "the current observational situation is depicted in figure 9 .",
    "the next outburst of interest is the 1971 outburst and at present there exists only one observing point ( figure 10 ) .",
    "figure 11 shows the expected correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath40 . if enough observations are found , it should be possible to determine the @xmath1 value with the accuracy as high as @xmath48 units .",
    ", width=288 ]    the 1995 outburst was already used in our solution .",
    "there was an intensive monitoring campaign of oj287 ( called oj94 ) during this outburst season , but unfortunately there exists a gap in these observations just at the crucial time ( figure 12 ) .",
    "it may still be possible that there are measurements somewhere which are not recorded in the oj94 campaign light curve , and which would be valuable in narrowing down @xmath1 even from these data .",
    "the line in figure 12 is drawn using the standard light curve of figure 3 as a template to compare with the 1995 observations . in set 11",
    "the value of @xmath40 has been shifted down by 3.5 hours , and in set 12 it is shifted up by the same amount .",
    "the shifts lead to shifting @xmath49 up or down by @xmath50 .",
    "it should be noted that even a few more measurements of 1995 could narrow down the range of @xmath1 .",
    "and the starting time of the 2019 outburst @xmath40 ( labelled @xmath51 when @xmath43 .",
    "the functional form of the correlation is given inside the figure .",
    "there is also a correlation with the @xmath46 such that the line of regression is shifted to the right in the figure by one unit for a decrease of @xmath46 by 0.0125 units .",
    "five units in the time axis corresponds to 4.4 hours .",
    "[ fig13],width=288 ]    let us now turn our attention to the expected future outbursts in our binary black hole model .",
    "we expect three more outbursts during the next two decades occuring in 2015 , 2019 and 2022 .",
    "as we mentioned above , the 2015 outburst should be an easy one to detect , as it is expected in december of that year .",
    "the exact date will in fact give us a good spin value .",
    "the dependence on @xmath1 is secondary , and thus it is of no use by itself for the testing of the no - hair theorems .",
    "the 2019 outburst is sensitive to the @xmath1 and with @xmath52 , it should begin at 2019.53175 if @xmath44 ( figure 13 ) . with good timing the @xmath1 value is determined with the accuracy of @xmath53 ( figure 14 ) . if by good luck we will find the necessary historical data to time both the 1959 and 1971 outbursts in addition to observing the 2019 outburst , we get close to the @xmath54 accuracy in @xmath1 ( see the combined sets 1 + 2 + 5 - 9 in table 3 ) .",
    "improvements in understanding the astrophysical processes in oj287 may then bring the accuracy even below @xmath54 . without the accurate timing in 2019 ,",
    "the @xmath1 value can not be determined better than to @xmath55 even if the @xmath46 determination in 2015 is a success ( figure 6 ) .     in the simulations where the 2019 outbursts has been timed with the accuracy of 5 hr and also the @xmath46 value has been found by the observations of the 2015 outburst .",
    "this gives the practical limit of the method of using oj287 to test general relativity if historical records do not bring additional information at key moments of time .",
    "[ fig14],width=288 ]    however , observing oj287 during the expected 2019 outburst window , namely around 2019 july 21 , is practically impossible from the ground .",
    "this is because the angular distance between the sun and oj287 in the sky is only about 12 degrees at the beginning of this event , and it goes down to 8 degrees by the time of the peak flux .",
    "it may require space observations to carry out the measurement .",
    "the 2022 outburst is scheduled practically at the same time of year as the 2019 outburst .",
    "obviously it would also be of interest to observe this event as it would tie down the parameters of the general model more narrowly .",
    "however , it will not give any further information on @xmath1 .",
    "the 1922 outburst follows an impact on the outer disk , and these impact timings are not sensitive to @xmath1 .",
    "finally , let us comment on the effect of additional features introduced in the present study .",
    "first , the improvement in the timing of the outbursts with respect to valtonen et al .",
    "( 2010a ) does improve the accuracy of the @xmath1 determination . comparing set 4 with sets 1 , 5 and 6",
    "we see that the @xmath4 of the distribution is greater by @xmath56 when the timing intervals are wider .",
    "if the angle between the disk axis and the primary spin axis varies as in valtonen ( 2010a ) , the distribution is not centered on @xmath44 ( set 10 ) , unlike in our standard case .",
    "the solutions in valtonen ( 2010a ) were not numerous enough to detect this effect reliably .",
    "the effect of the @xmath57 on the @xmath1 distribution was calculated in three cases : first with the `` normal '' direction of the secondary spin @xmath57 , then with the opposite spin , and finally with zero spin .",
    "the three distributions are different , showing that the spin - spin interaction has influenced the orbits ( sets 1 , 5 and 6 ) , but the gaussian parameters of the distributions are only marginally different from each other .",
    "the objects at small angular distances from the sun ( the estimated value for oj287 is 8 to 12 degrees ) are difficult to observe due to high background caused by intense sunlight .",
    "the vignetting of the highly luminous solar disk enables a reduction of the background and observion of stars near the sun . recently",
    "two different methods have been used to observe stars at small angular distances from the sun , namely the coronagraph method , and the helioscopic imager method .",
    "the coronagraph has been in use already for a long time both in the ground based as well as in space based observations .",
    "the soho s lasco c3 can serve as an example of a recent coronagraph in space ( morrill et al .",
    "the soho spacecraft has three coronagraphs ( lasco ) onboard , two of which are still working ( c2 and c3 ) .",
    "we have used the publicly available images of these experiments to estimate the expected limiting magnitudes for this method . estimating limiting magnitude for c2 is difficult because most of the lasco c2 image is obscured by the solar corona and only a few stars are visible .",
    "lasco c3 covers an area of 32 diameters of the sun ( i.e. about 16 degrees , hence the oj287 position during the 2019 predicted flare would be covered ) and stars are clearly visible in the images , although a large part of the image is also obscured by the solar corona .",
    "there are several problems which complicate the estimation of the limiting magnitude .",
    "the dominant one is the stray light which can be mistaken as background stars .",
    "there also several problems in determining the position and rotation of the spacecraft .",
    "one has to align the stars on the image from lasco c3 and a star chart for the position ( aavso charts can be used ) . for the elimination of the stay light , the video which is provided on the soho web pages",
    "if there is a point source in five images in a row , we consider it a star .",
    "the rotation also complicates determination of the background stars .",
    "the best method here is to find a noticeably bright star and to align the image with the chart containing this star and its surroundings .",
    "pleiades are possibly the best objects to use , because the star cluster clearly defines the rotation . for our work",
    "we have used an image of pleiades where stars show up to the limiting magnitude of 10 .",
    "it is compared with an the image from lasco c3 ( 14.05.2010 , sun approaching pleiades ) .",
    "the faintest stars of pleiades detectable in the lasco c3 image are of magnitude 8 . hence at best",
    ", we can obtain a limiting magnitude around 8 at the edges of the field where the corona is faint .",
    "also the result strongly depends on the state of corona as during strong coronal mass ejections the limiting magnitude will be lower .    probably a deeper magnitude could be achieved for a space based coronagraph with a larger aperture , but this would require an independent feasibility study as the previous coronagraphs were designed for solar studies , not for photometry of nearby stars .    in an independent study of the c3 limiting magnitude by andrews ( 2000 ) using the same target ( pleiades cluster ) , deeper limits of magnitudes between 10 and 14",
    "were achieved . as we would require a limiting magnitude of 15 or better for our timing measurement in july 2019",
    ", it is clear that a lasco c3 type instrument will not be able to do the job .",
    "another method recently used in a space experiment is the method of heliospheric imager which is part of the secchi experiment ( howard et al .",
    "2008 , eyles et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the secchi experiment is onboard the stereo space mission and consists of five telescopes , which together image the solar corona from the solar disk to beyond 1 au .",
    "these telescopes are : an extreme ultraviolet imager ( euvi : 1 - 1.7 solar radii ) , two traditional lyot coronagraphs ( cor1 : 1.5 - 4 solar radii and cor2 : 2.5 - 15 solar radii ) and two new designs of heliospheric imagers ( hi-1 : 15 - 84 solar radii and hi-2 : 66 - 318 solar radii ) .",
    "all the instruments use @xmath58 pixel ccd arrays in a backside - in mode .",
    "the euvi backside surface has been specially processed for euv sensitivity , while the others have an anti - reflection coating applied .",
    "the hi objectives , like the rest of the secchi suite , make visible light observations of cmes and other structures as they transit from the corona and into the heliosphere .",
    "the hi package consists of two small , wide - angle telescope systems ( hi-1 and hi-2 ) mounted on the side of each stereo spacecraft , which together view the region between the sun and the earth .",
    "hi has no shutter mechanism , other than a one - shot door that protects the instrument from contamination during ground operations and the launch .",
    "thus , an image is collected in a shutterless mode , in which the intensity at each pixel is an accumulation of the static scene and a smearing of the image during readout .",
    "this smearing can be removed on the ground .",
    "the hi instrument concept was derived from the laboratory measurements of buffington et al .",
    "( 1996 ) who determined the scattering rejection as a function of the number of occulters and the angle below the occulting edge .",
    "the concept is not unlike observing the night sky after the sun has gone below the horizon .",
    "while the specific concept used here has not been flown before , two other instruments have flown which have validated the ability to measure the electron scattered component against the strong zodiacal light and stellar background .",
    "the zodiacal light photometer ( pitz et al . 1976 ) on the helios spacecraft , launched in 1974 , and the solar mass ejection imager ( smei ) instrument ( eyles et al .",
    "2003 ) , on the coriolis spacecraft , launched in 2003 have demonstrated that a properly baffled instrument can detect cmes ( tappin et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the hi-1 and hi-2 telescopes are directed to angles of about 13 degrees and 53 degrees from the principal axis of the instrument , which in turn is tilted upwards by 0.33 degrees to ensure that the sun is sufficiently below the baffle horizon .",
    "the novel heliospheric imagers achieve magnitude limits for stars of about 13 to 14 in a 40 minute exposure .",
    "the hi-1 imager covers the region of 7,5 to 24 degrees from sun and is hence well suited to observe the oj287 during the predicted 2019 event ( oj287 is expected to brighten from @xmath59 to @xmath60 in v - magnitude ) . a specific design for a dedicated space experiment to observe oj287 optimizing the performace for stellar fotometry at angular distances around 10 degrees from the sun may lead to a limiting magnitude increase to about 15 .",
    "another possibility involves pointing long range reconnaissance imager ( lorri ) in the ` new horizons ' mission to pluto that consists of a telescope with a 20.8 centimeter aperture at oj287 for one week in july 2019 . in the @xmath61 pixel binning mode the limiting magnitude in v",
    "is expected to be greater than 17 ( cheng et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the oj287 heliospheric imager is expected to provide in addition to the oj287 photometry valuable data for other scientific fields such as monitoring of astrophysical targets near to sun , and optical searches for optical counterparts to grbs occurring at small angular distances from the sun .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to test gr at the second pn order using the binary black hole system in oj287 .",
    "we find that gr can be confirmed with the one sigma accuracy of @xmath62 using the currect observations and theoretical understanding of the system .",
    "one of the theoretical conditions is that the rotation axis of the accretion disk is at a constant angle with respect to the precessing spin axis of the primary black hole .",
    "it may be possible to verify this in future by studying the structure of the radio / x - ray jet in oj287 , and by theoretical studies of how the jet direction is determined when the two axes are not parallel to each other . with this proviso , we argue that it should be possible to test , in principle , the black hole no - hair theorem at the @xmath0 level in the current decade by employing the binary black hole model of oj287 .",
    "we have also shown that the third order pn terms are too small to be detected in the oj287 system .",
    "they depend on the exact value of the primary mass , at the @xmath63 level , as well as on the spin of the secondary , for which it is difficult to find independent measurements at the required level of accuracy .    we demonstrate that the testing at the above precision will require a certain amount of good luck in the sense that there should exist some yet unknown observations in the historical records at certain crucial time windows . also it is highly desirable to have space - based optical observations to monitor the impact outburst of oj287 in 2019 .",
    "one possibility is to use the ` new horizons ' mission to pluto which by 2019 is already past pluto .",
    "employing a suitable solar observing mission to monitor oj287 could be another option .",
    "we have looked at the soho coronagraph images and find that the limiting magnitude there is @xmath64 .",
    "we would need to get to magnitudes @xmath65 in blue or uv , and thus one would need to cover the innermost 5 degrees of the solar image instead of just the solar disk . a better case for the no - hair test would be a continuation or follow - up mission of stereo which would for one week concentrate on oj287 instead of solar flares .    due to the fundamental nature of the test and the fact that the astrophysical systems associated with the other proposed tests are yet to be observed and likely to be plausible only in the next decade , it may not be even be out of question to plan a small space mission to monitor the 2019 outburst and hence to test the black hole no - hair theorems .",

    "<S> we can say that @xmath3 ( one @xmath4 ) , in agreement with general relativity and the no - hair theorems . we demonstrate that this result can be improved if more observational data is found in historical plate archives for the @xmath5 and @xmath6 outbursts . we also show that the predicted @xmath7 and @xmath8 outbursts will be crucial in improving the accuracy of the test . </S>",
    "<S> space - based photometry is required in 2019 july due the proximity of oj287 to the sun at the time of the outburst . </S>",
    "<S> the best situation would be to carry out the photometry far from the earth , from quite a different vantage point , in order to avoid the influence of the nearby sun . </S>",
    "<S> we have considered in particular the stereo space mission which would be ideal if it has a continuation in 2019 or lorri on board the new horizons mission to pluto . </S>"
