    "spin - polarized electrons in gaas interact with lattice nuclei through the hyperfine interaction , leading to dynamic nuclear polarization ( dnp).@xcite typical dnp experiments in gaas exploit the spin - dependent selection rules for optical transitions to generate the necessary population of spin - polarized electrons in the conduction band .",
    "recent experiments have demonstrated the electrical injection of spin - polarized electrons using a metallic ferromagnet as a contact and a band - engineered schottky tunnel barrier.@xcite the question naturally arises whether the electrically injected population of spin - polarized carriers interacts with lattice nuclei in a manner similar to optically injected spin - polarized carriers . in this paper",
    "we present a series of experiments in which a current of spin - polarized electrons electrically injected from an fe contact dynamically polarizes lattice nuclei in a @xmath0/gaas quantum well ( qw ) .",
    "the nuclear polarization and its subsequent effects on electron spin dynamics are well - described by the same model of dnp used to understand optical orientation experiments . however , the magnetic anisotropies of the fe contact allow access to new geometries for observing the interaction between spin - polarized electrons and nuclei that can not be achieved in optical spin - pumping experiments .",
    "in addition , we show that modulation of the spin polarization of the current can be used to control the hyperfine interaction directly , leading to the observation of nuclear magnetic resonance in very low applied fields .",
    "many experiments have utilized the selection rules for optical transitions in gaas to measure the spin polarization of conduction band electrons.@xcite these selection rules allow for a simple mapping between the net luminescence circular polarization @xmath1 where @xmath2 are the intensities of the two helicities of circularly polarized light , and the average electron spin along the sample normal : @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the average electron spin in the quantum well ( qw ) , and @xmath5 for luminescence from qw systems while @xmath6 for bulk systems.@xcite@xmath7@xcite the orientation and magnitude of @xmath4 will in turn depend on the applied magnetic field @xmath8 and the electron spin lifetime @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the rate of electron spin relaxation and @xmath11 is the rate of electron - hole recombination .",
    "the electron spin immediately after injection into the qw is given by the vector @xmath12 .",
    "spin relaxation that occurs before the electrons recombine with holes reduces the total spin in the qw from its initial value @xmath13 to its steady - state value @xmath14 . in addition",
    ", the spin will precess about @xmath8 whenever @xmath15 .",
    "the angle through which the spin precesses is determined by the product @xmath16 of the larmor precession frequency and the electron spin lifetime where @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the effective electron @xmath19-factor , @xmath20 is the bohr magneton and @xmath21 is planck s constant . typically , @xmath22 at 5  kg and @xmath23  ps , giving @xmath24 . combining these processes of injection , precession , relaxation and recombination",
    ", we can define a rate equation that describes the dynamics of the electron spin in the qw:@xcite @xmath25 luminescence is a steady - state measurement , and therefore we can set @xmath26 and solve for @xmath4 .",

    "for the experiments under discussion here , the @xmath31-component @xmath32 is detected by the luminescence circular polarization @xmath33 , and @xmath12 is electrically injected from a ferromagnetic metal contact .    in the case of electrical injection of spin - polarized electrons from a thin fe film , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the direction of the fe contact magnetization",
    ", @xmath36 is the spin polarization of the fe contact , and @xmath37 is the efficiency of spin transport across the interface .",
    "magnetic shape anisotropy in the thin film causes the fe magnetization to lie in - plane at low magnetic fields .",
    "hence , at @xmath38 , @xmath12 will be entirely in - plane and the luminescence along the @xmath31-direction will be unpolarized . in order to achieve @xmath39 in the qw , either the fe magnetization must be rotated out of the plane prior to the injection of spin - polarized electrons , or the injected spin must precess out - of - plane after reaching the qw .",

    "[ fig : s284nmr - nonlinear - waterfall]-[fig : s284-nmr - currentdriven ] demonstrate the presence of perturbations to the zeeman eigenstates of the nuclei .",
    "there are two primary perturbations that can lead to the higher harmonic transitions : nuclear dipole - dipole coupling and electric quadrupole coupling .",
    "the dipole - dipole hamiltonian can be constructed from the interaction between two dipoles : @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and the hamiltonian can be written as@xcite @xmath65 where    [ eq : h - dipole - a - f ] @xmath66    @xmath67 are the raising and lowering operators , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are polar coordinates , and the magnetic field is along @xmath40 .",
    "the dipole - dipole hamiltonian enters as a perturbation to the zeeman hamiltonian ( eq .  [ eq : h - zeeman ] ) for two spins , @xmath70 the different terms @xmath71 in @xmath72 connect the nuclear zeeman sub - levels @xmath73 . in the @xmath74 case ,",
    "the @xmath75 transitions are allowed while the @xmath76 and @xmath77 transitions are forbidden . however , the terms @xmath78 in the dipole hamiltonian are off - diagonal and will produce admixtures of the zero - order zeeman states .",
    "the admixtures have the important effect of making the previously forbidden transitions allowable .",
    "it therefore becomes possible to observe resonances at frequencies two and three times the primary @xmath47 , and at sums of frequencies @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 each correspond to any of the three isotopes in the qw.@xcite    the second perturbation to the zeeman hamiltonian that can result in resonances at harmonics of the principal frequencies is the nuclear quadrupole interaction .",
    "the ga and as nuclei in gaas are spin-@xmath82 and have electric quadrupole moments . in the presence of an electric field gradient ( efg )",
    ", the quadrupole moments can affect the allowed transitions for a single nucleus .",
    "the electric field gradients typically associated with quadrupole effects in nmr are not present in gaas . however , in @xmath83 , the partial replacement of ga atoms with al atoms alters the local as environment and breaks the cubic symmetry , leading to electric field gradients and quadrupole coupling for the @xmath84as nuclei.@xcite smaller , but perhaps still significant electric field gradients that affect all three nuclear species will occur at layer interfaces within the heterostructure .",
    "in general , the quadrupole hamiltonian induces an admixture of zeeman states that makes @xmath76 and @xmath85 transitions allowed for a single nucleus .",
    "however , the efg for @xmath84as is larger than efgs for the other nuclei , and therefore one would expect the @xmath86 and the @xmath87 signals to dominate those from the ga isotope harmonics , which is not the case .",
    "also , significant quadruole coupling should cause splitting in the resonance lines,@xcite which is also not observed . if quadrupole coupling is a cause of the harmonics in figs .",
    "[ fig : s284nmr - nonlinear - waterfall]-[fig : s284-nmr - currentdriven ] , then it appears it is a weak coupling that is simply enough to mix the zeeman eigenstates .",
    "perturbations to the zeeman eigenstates from both dipole - dipole coupling and quadrupole coupling can lead to the resonant transitions at @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the resonant transitions at @xmath79 where @xmath88 in figs .",
    "[ fig : s284-nmr - fielddep ] and [ fig : s284-nmr - currentdriven ] can only be due to @xmath89 . still , there are some inconsistencies between the data and these explanations .",
    "as mentioned above , quadrupole coupling in @xmath83 should lead to @xmath54 resonances with greater weight than the ga resonances , which is not observed .",
    "in addition , one would expect the resonance lines to split.@xcite however , no splittings are observed .",
    "the second major inconsistency concerns the dipole - dipole coupling .",
    "@xmath89 is more likely to couple unlike nuclei than like nuclei due to the @xmath90 dependence of the dipole interaction , and therefore one would expect more instances of transitions at @xmath79 where @xmath88 than are actually observed in coil - driven nmr .",
    "there are very few features in fig .",
    "[ fig : s284-nmr - fielddep ] that correspond to coupling between unlike nuclei and there are none in fig .",
    "[ fig : s284nmr - nonlinear - waterfall ] .",
    "in fact , a key distinction between the coil - driven nmr of figs .  [",
    "fig : s284nmr - simple]-[fig : s284-nmr - fielddep ] and the current - driven nmr of fig .",
    "[ fig : s284-nmr - currentdriven ] is the relative prevalence in the current - driven case of resonances at sum frequencies where @xmath88 .",
    "a speculative explanation that accounts for the distinction between current - driven and coil - driven nmr with respect to dipole - dipole coupling is that the nuclear spin polarization diffuses away from the qw and into the @xmath0 barriers .",
    "nuclear spin diffusion has been ignored in all of the preceding discussion of dnp in this paper.@xcite polarized nuclei in the @xmath0 barriers experience larger electric field gradients due to al substitution and layer interfaces than the nuclei in the gaas qw .",
    "therefore , any polarized nuclei in the qw barriers will be comparatively more likely to be perturbed by quadrupole coupling . in the coil - driven nmr experiment ,",
    "the entire sample is irradiated with the time dependent field @xmath43 .",
    "nuclear spin relaxation in the @xmath0 barriers at frequencies allowed by quadrupole coupling would extend into the qw on the time scale of @xmath91  @xmath92s .",
    "quadrupole coupling in a coil - driven experiment will allow the @xmath44 and @xmath45 resonances that are observed in abundance in figs .",
    "[ fig : s284nmr - nonlinear - waterfall ] and [ fig : s284-nmr - fielddep ] without the expectation for a similar abundance of @xmath79 where @xmath88 .    in the case of current - driven nmr",
    "the modulated device bias combines multiple possible drives for nuclear spin transitions , including hyperfine interactions , carrier concentration,@xcite band bending,@xcite and even biot - savart fields from the current .",
    "the latter three possible sources would affect the entire sample just as @xmath43 does in coil - driven nmr .",
    "but modulation of the hyperfine interaction is confined to the qw .",
    "the local hyperfine field is equivalent to the knight shift , which will be approximately 1  oe in the gaas qw with @xmath93 electron spin polarization.@xcite a knight field of a few tenths of an oe would be enough , in principle , to induce resonant nuclear spin depolarization in the qw , where quadrupole effects should be weakest but dipole - dipole coupling is still present .",
    "the current - driven nmr data of fig .",
    "[ fig : s284-nmr - currentdriven ] shows the strongest evidence for dipole - dipole coupled transitions between unlike nuclei , with resonance amplitudes on a similar scale as the other features .",
    "thus , the difference between coil - driven nmr and current - driven nmr may be the difference between a global drive and a local drive : @xmath43 will interact with all nuclei in the sample while a modulated knight field will only interact with nuclei in the qw .",
    "perhaps the most relevant aspect of the experiment for explaining the resonances at frequencies other than @xmath47 is the amplitude of the depolarizing mechanism .",
    "note that in both nmr experiments , the appearance of the non - linear features is aided by the strong modulation amplitude of the driving depolarization source : @xmath43 in the case of figs .",
    "[ fig : s284nmr - nonlinear - waterfall ] and [ fig : s284-nmr - fielddep ] , and the device bias in fig .",
    "[ fig : s284-nmr - currentdriven ] .",
    "clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig : s284nmr - nonlinear - waterfall ] the @xmath44 and @xmath45 transitions appear only for high @xmath43 amplitudes .",
    "these peak values of @xmath43 that generate the non - linear resonance features exceed the typical nmr saturation condition of @xmath94.@xcite in the current case of @xmath95  khz / oe , @xmath96  seconds and assuming @xmath91  @xmath92s , the saturation condition is satisfied for @xmath97  oe .",
    "all of the points in fig .",
    "[ fig : s284-nmr - fielddep ] are taken at the highest @xmath43 amplitude in fig .",
    "[ fig : s284nmr - nonlinear - waterfall ] . hence the appearance of some non - linear affects",
    "may be expected simply from driving the nuclear spin system far out of equilibrium .",
    "curiously , the primary resonances do not broaden significantly as the saturation condition is exceeded.@xcite    in summary , the nmr data demonstrate saturation of the ordinary magnetic dipole transitions , the existence of dipole - dipole coupling , and that resonant modulation of the spin - polarized current can selectively depolarize the nuclei in the qw .",
    "the presence of a time dependent knight field in the current - driven case may explain some of the differences observed in the two types of resonance experiments .",
    "in this paper we have discussed a series of investigations of electron spin dynamics in the presence of hyperfine effects in fe/@xmath0/gaas spin injection heterostructures .",
    "the typical nuclear polarization at 20  k in these structures is on the order of 510% and strongly depends on electron spin polarization .",
    "the effective magnetic field felt by the electrons in the configurations studied here is on the order of 4  kg .",
    "the presence of nuclear polarization is both intrinsic evidence of successful spin - polarized electron transport and provides an additional mechanism for confirming faraday spin injection measurements .",
    "the electron spin dynamics in the presence of electrically driven nuclear spin polarization are well described by the same set of equations used for dynamics in the presence of optically pumped nuclear spin polarization .",
    "these dynamics can be modeled with four parameters : the steady - state electron spin polarization @xmath14 in the qw , the conservation of angular momentum in the coupling of the electron and nuclear spin systems as characterized by the leakage factor @xmath98 , the precessional field scale @xmath99 , and @xmath100 , the ratio of the relaxation rates for non - hyperfine assisting polarization and depolarization processes .",
    "the upper bound for @xmath14 is set by faraday geometry spin injection measurements , @xmath99 is measured using optical pumping hanle curves , and single parameter fits to the data on large and small field scales determine @xmath98 and @xmath100 .",
    "the self - consistency of the bias dependence of @xmath14 as measured in the faraday geometry , in which the nuclear polarization does not affect @xmath33 , and @xmath101 in the oblique easy axis geometry establishes the accuracy of experimental determinations of electrically injected steady - state spin polarization using the spin - led .",
    "finally , the electrically driven nmr and adiabatic inversion of the nuclear spin demonstrate the ability to electrically create and manipulate polarized nuclei using the hyperfine interaction in a ferromagnet / semiconductor heterostructure .",
    "we acknowledge brian collins for his early contributions to this experiment . this work was supported in part by",
    "the darpa spins program under onr / n00014 - 99 - 1005 and onr / n00014 - 01 - 0830 and also by the nsf mrsec program under dmr 98 - 09364 and dmr 02 - 12032 .",
    "the effective @xmath19-factor is estimated to be @xmath104 for a 100   gaas qw on a [ 100 ] substrate based on ref .  .",
    "the estimate is provided here as a point of reference since @xmath99 as measured by the optical pumping hanle effect already includes the effective @xmath19-factor ."
