    "the rare decay of a @xmath1 meson into a meson containing a strange quark and a photon is very sensitive to new physics which is connected to the fact that in the standard model ( sm ) this process is loop - induced .",
    "thus a precise comparison of theoretical calculations and experimental measurements can lead to important hints on the theory beyond the sm .",
    "conventionally the decay is normalized to the semileptonic @xmath2-meson decay .",
    "the corresponding branching ratio has meanwhile been measured by cleo  @xcite , aleph  @xcite , belle  @xcite and babar  @xcite which is summarized in fig .",

    "[ fig::bsgexp ] the latter is compared to the measurements . in the near future",
    "the experimental error will reduce to approximately 5% which reduces the current error by almost a factor of two .",
    "thus also the reduction of the theoretical uncertainty in eq .",
    "( [ eq::brtheo ] ) is mandatory .    at",
    "next - to - leading order ( nlo ) a detailed analysis of the theoretical error has been performed in ref .",
    "it has been shown that the largest uncertainty comes form the dependence on the charm quark mass which arises for the first time at this order . including all next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) effects one arrives at an uncertainty of approximately 7% which has to be compared with the 8% error quoted in eq .",
    "( [ eq::brtheo ] ) .",
    "thus a complete nnlo calculation can significantly reduce the theoretical uncertainty .",
    "calculations for the process @xmath5 are conveniently performed within the framework of an effective theory where the scales of order @xmath6 and higher are integrated out .",
    "this leads to an effective lagrangian of the form @xmath7 z_{ij }      p_j\\ , , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the fermi constant , @xmath9 stands for the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix , @xmath10 are the operators , @xmath11 are the wilson coefficients and @xmath12 the corresponding renormalization constants .",
    "more details and explicit expressions can be found in  @xcite and references cited therein .    in such an effective - theory framework",
    "the calculation splits into three steps : ( i ) the matching of the full and the effective theory at the high scale , ( ii ) the evaluation of the operator matrix elements at the low scale @xmath13 , and ( iii ) the running from the high to the low scale . at nnlo step ( i )",
    "requires the evaluation of two - loop diagrams in order to obtain the matching coefficients for the four - fermion operators which has been performed in ref .",
    "the three - loop matching coefficients @xmath14 and @xmath15 of the dimension - five dipole operators have been evaluated in ref .",
    "@xcite which will be considered in more detail in section  [ sec::c7c8 ] .",
    "as far as the evaluation of the nnlo operator matrix elements are concerned up to now only the fermionic corrections of @xmath16 to @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are known  @xcite . at nlo",
    "these operators are numerically important which is a strong motivation to consider the numerical effects at nnlo .",
    "furthermore , once the corrections proportional to @xmath21 are available , it is tempting to apply the so - called naive non - abelianization in order to estimate the complete corrections of order @xmath22 .",
    "this is based on the observation that the lowest coefficient of the qcd @xmath23 function , @xmath24 , is quite large and thus it is expected that the replacement of @xmath21 by @xmath25 may lead to a good approximation of the full order @xmath22 corrections . in section  [ sec::ferm ]",
    "we provide more details on this calculation .",
    "finally , section  [ sec::concl ] contains our conclusions .",
    "there are several possibilities to evaluate the matching coefficients . for instance",
    ", it is possible to evaluate the feynman diagrams on - shell .",
    "however , we find it more convenient to follow the procedure outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite where all the necessary diagrams are evaluated off - shell , after expanding them in the external momenta . in intermediate steps",
    "spurious infrared divergences appear which are generated by the expansion and are regulated dimensionally .",
    "they cancel out in the matching equation , i.e. in the difference between the full sm and the effective theory off - shell amplitudes .",
    "the scalar three - loop integrals are evaluated with the help of the package matad @xcite designed for calculating vacuum diagrams .",
    "the fact that matad can deal with a single non - vanishing mass only is not an obstacle against taking into account the actually different masses of the @xmath26 boson and the top quark .",
    "expansions starting from @xmath27 and @xmath28 allow us to accurately determine the three - loop matching conditions for the physical values of @xmath29 and @xmath6 .",
    "three - loop diagrams that contributes to @xmath30.,width=151 ]    the matching coefficients are obtained from the requirement that the one - particle - irreducible green functions in the full and effective theory are equal . in the latter case",
    "only tree - level diagrams contribute as after expansion in the external momenta only scale - less integrals appear which are set to zero in dimensional regularization  @xcite .",
    "however , the counterterm contributions that arise from the effective - theory side have to be taken into account . on the sm side we have to consider of the order of 1000 three - loop diagrams .",
    "one of which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : samplesm ] .",
    "obviously , when the virtual top quark is present in the open fermion line , we have to deal with three - loop vacuum integrals involving two mass scales , @xmath29 and @xmath6 .",
    "also in the charm - quark sector such two - scale integrals are encountered when closed top - quark loops arise on the virtual gluon lines . at present ,",
    "complete three - loop algorithms exist for vacuum integrals involving only a single mass scale .",
    "we have reduced our calculation to such integrals by performing expansions around the point @xmath27 and for @xmath28 . in the latter case ,",
    "the method of asymptotic expansions of feynman integrals has been applied @xcite which has been implemented in the c++ program exp  @xcite . at the physical point",
    "where @xmath31 , both expansions work reasonably well .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : c7 ] where the one- , two- and three - loop results for @xmath14 , defined through @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) , are shown as functions of @xmath34 .",
    "( the plots for @xmath15 show an analog behaviour and can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . )     +     the variable @xmath35 changes from 0 to 1 , i.e. both starting points of our expansions are present in the figures .",
    "note the relatively narrow ranges of the coefficient values on the vertical axes .",
    "the large @xmath29 expansions ( up to @xmath36 ) are depicted by the dot - dashed lines , while the expansions around @xmath37 ( up to @xmath38 ) are given by the dashed ones . in the one- and two - loop cases ,",
    "solid curves show the exact results .",
    "the vertical strips mark the experimental values for @xmath35 .    comparing the three curves in the one- and two - loop cases",
    ", one can conclude that a combination of the two expansions at hand gives a good determination of the studied coefficients in the whole considered range of @xmath35 .",
    "although we do not know the exact curves in the three - loop case , the same pattern seems to repeat .",
    "in fact , the charm - sector expansions perfectly overlap in the physical region . in the top sector",
    ", one can ( conservatively ) conclude that @xmath39 which is perfectly accurate for any phenomenological application .",
    "let us note that a change of @xmath40 from 12 to 13 would affect the @xmath41 decay width by only 0.02% , while a similar variation of @xmath42 would cause even a smaller effect .",
    "more detailed results can be found in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the fermionic nnlo corrections of @xmath16 to @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( cf . ref .",
    "@xcite for their definition ) require the evaluation of two- and three - loop diagrams where a light fermion loop is inserted into the gluon line .",
    "sample diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig::p_i ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the numerical effect of the @xmath16 corrections",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : branching ] .",
    "the corrections are moderate and amount to @xmath43 for @xmath44  gev and to @xmath45 for @xmath46  gev .",
    "[ fig : branching ] illustrates that the @xmath47 dependence of the @xmath16 improved prediction for the branching ratio is somewhat flatter than in the nlo case if we restrict ourselves to @xmath48  gev .",
    "this is a welcome feature of our result , however , in general we can not expect to reduce the @xmath47 dependence as the solid curve only represents a part of the nnlo result .",
    "indeed , we obtain a stronger @xmath47-dependence in the region below @xmath49  gev .",
    "in this contribution we reported on the first nnlo calculations to the branching ratio @xmath0 . in particular , the three - loop matching calculations for @xmath14 and @xmath15 have been described  @xcite .",
    "together with the two - loop calculation for the other relevant operators calculated several years ago  @xcite this completes the first step towards a complete nnlo analysis .    as far as the corrections to the operator matrix elements",
    "are concerned up to now only the fermionic corrections to the numerically most important operators @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) have been evaluated  @xcite . the remaining ( virtual and real ) corrections are not yet available .",
    "the same is true for the evaluation of the anomalous dimension to nnlo where diagrams up to four loops , from which the pole parts are needed , have to be computed .",
    "it should be stressed that only the complete nnlo calculation , outlined after eq .",
    "( [ eq::lag ] ) , leads to a scheme and scale independent result and is thus able to reduce the charm quark mass ambiguity .",
