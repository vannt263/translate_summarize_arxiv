    "for @xmath3 a positive square - free integer , pell s equation is@xmath4 this is perhaps the most important diophantine equation .",
    "its history goes back to the ancient greeks , to archimedes _ cattle problem _ ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , to brahmagupta and bhaskara , to fermat and euler , and it was lagrange who finally established the main fact :    pell s equation has an infinite number of integer solutions .",
    "proofs are found in many books and articles on number theory , see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "arguments based on continued fractions for quadratic irrationals are common .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give a self - contained , simplified proof which only requires basic knowledge of matrix multiplication and _ integer arithmetic_. so you need not know what is meant by an _",
    "irrational number_.    we follow classical ideas of lagrange and gauss , and also insights due to conway @xcite and others .",
    "the use of @xmath5 and @xmath6 matrices is not new , see for example @xcite and @xcite , and the computation of the fundamental automorphism of a binary quadratic form as described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6.12 ) also avoids irrationalities  but our approach is simpler and requires a minimum of background knowledge .",
    "we show how the method works explicitly in a few special cases , including the famous historical example of @xmath7 and mention a palindromic aspect of the solution which also sheds light on the negative pell equation @xmath8 while we generate an infinite number of integer solutions , we do not address the issue of whether or not _ all _ solutions are obtained by this method .    at the end of the paper",
    "we briefly connect our solution to paths in the _ stern - brocot tree _ , and mention the connections with _",
    "universal geometry_.    we need just a few basic definitions .",
    "a * quadratic form * is an expression in variables @xmath9 and @xmath10 of the form@xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are integers .",
    "we write @xmath14 for short .",
    "note that we are following gauss convention in using an even coefficient of @xmath15 for a ( column ) vector @xmath16 define@xmath17 the symmetric matrix @xmath18 is the * matrix * of the quadratic form @xmath19 .",
    "the number @xmath20 is the * determinant * of @xmath21    the quadratic form @xmath19 is * balanced * if @xmath22 and @xmath23 for example , the * *  pell quadratic form * * @xmath24 for @xmath25 is balanced since its matrix is@xmath26",
    "if @xmath19 is a quadratic form with matrix @xmath27 and @xmath28 is an invertible integral @xmath29 matrix whose inverse also has integer entries , then we may define a new quadratic form @xmath30 by @xmath31 with matrix @xmath32 we say that @xmath19 and @xmath30 are * equivalent * forms , and notice that they take on the same values , since if @xmath33 then @xmath34 and conversely if @xmath35 then @xmath36 since the assumptions on @xmath28 imply that @xmath37 we must have @xmath38 so equivalent forms have the same determinant .    for example , the pell quadratic form @xmath39 is equivalent to the quadratic form @xmath40 since @xmath41 the form @xmath42 takes the value @xmath43 at @xmath44 and @xmath30 takes the same value @xmath45 at @xmath46 the relationship between these two solutions is @xmath47 note that while @xmath42 is balanced , @xmath30 is not .    in practice",
    "we will focus on two very simple equivalences , using the following matrices:@xmath48{lllll}% $ l\\equiv% \\begin{pmatrix } 1 & 0\\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix } $ &   & \\textrm{and } &   & $ r\\equiv% \\begin{pmatrix } 1 & 1\\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix } .$% \\end{tabular}\\ ] ]    for a symmetric matrix @xmath18 we compute@xmath49 and@xmath50    going from @xmath27 to @xmath51 we call a * *  left step**. going from @xmath27 to @xmath52 we call a * right step*.",
    "here is our strategy for generating an infinite number of solutions to pell s equation @xmath0 .    1 .",
    "first observe that @xmath53 is a solution .",
    "2 .   perform a _ suitable ( non - empty ) sequence of left and right steps _ , beginning with the pell quadratic form @xmath54 with matrix ( [ matrixa ] ) , and ending also with @xmath55 this yields a matrix equation of the form@xmath56 for some invertible matrix @xmath57 with _ strictly positive entries _ , actually of the form@xmath58 3 .   then observe that @xmath59 the first column of @xmath60 is also a solution , since @xmath61 4 .",
    "iterate to generate an infinite family of solutions , namely @xmath62    let us now explain what the _ suitable sequence of left and right steps is _ , and why we can be sure to return to @xmath63 after a finite number of such steps .",
    "the key is simply to _ ensure that at each stage we obtain a balanced form_.    if at some stage we have a balanced form @xmath64 , we compute the * total * @xmath65 if @xmath66 we _ perform a left step_. if @xmath67 we _ perform a right step_. then ( [ up ] ) and ( [ down ] ) ensure that the new form @xmath68 is also balanced , and it is clearly equivalent to @xmath64 .",
    "the case @xmath69cannot arise if the determinant of @xmath64 is @xmath70 since the identity@xmath71 would then imply that @xmath3 is a square .    to record the step at each stage , we write either@xmath72 or @xmath73",
    "suppose we have taken a step from the balanced quadratic form @xmath74 to the balanced quadratic form @xmath75 can we tell whether this step was left or right ?",
    "in the case of a left step @xmath76 while in the case of a right step @xmath77 .",
    "so the total of the quadratic form @xmath78 determines whether the step was left or right .",
    "if we start with the quadratic form @xmath54 with determinant @xmath79 and arrive after a certain number of steps to the quadratic form @xmath64 then we must have @xmath22 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 since @xmath82 is negative , there are only a finite number of integers @xmath12 and @xmath13 that satisfy this equation .",
    "so we must eventually return to a form that we have encountered before , and since we are capable of finding the inverse of any step , we must return first to the initial form , namely @xmath83    at the beginning with @xmath63 the total is @xmath84 so the first step must be a right step .",
    "further right steps increase the last entry of @xmath85 so before we return to @xmath63 we must have taken at least one left step . so the cumulative matrix @xmath60 which is the product of the matrices @xmath6 and @xmath5 corresponding to the steps we have taken , has strictly positive entries .",
    "this ensures that the sequence of solutions @xmath86 is increasing in each component , and so really does represent an infinite family of solutions .",
    "if@xmath87 then more generally ( [ nequation ] ) gives us the identity @xmath88 which allows us to generate new solutions to @xmath89 from existing ones , for any integer @xmath90 it also allows us to deduce that @xmath57 has the form @xmath58",
    "the simplest example of pell s equation is @xmath92 the ancient greeks knew how to generate solutions .",
    "geometrically we are looking for integer points on a hyperbola , as shown .",
    "pellsequation2.eps + the hyperbola @xmath93[pells2 ]    we begin with the pell quadratic form @xmath94 with a total of @xmath95 so we take a right step to get@xmath96 this corresponds to the matrix equation @xmath97 the total is now @xmath98 so we take a left step to get@xmath99 the total is now @xmath100 so we take another left step@xmath101 the total is now @xmath102 so we take a right step@xmath103 to return to our starting quadratic form @xmath104 this yields the matrix equation@xmath105 so @xmath106 gives the non - trivial solution @xmath107 to pell s equation , and by taking higher powers of @xmath57 we get further solutions @xmath108 @xmath109 @xmath110 and so on .    more generally the form of @xmath57",
    "establishes the identity@xmath111 which allows us to generate an infinite number of solutions to @xmath112 from any initial solution .",
    "the quadratic form @xmath114 gives the stepping sequence@xmath115 this corresponds to the matrix equation@xmath116 the first column of @xmath117 gives the solution @xmath118 and higher powers give also @xmath119 @xmath120 and so on .",
    "furthermore we have the identity@xmath121 which generates further solutions to any solution of @xmath122",
    "the palindromic nature of the sequences occurring for @xmath57 in the above two examples is a general feature , and follows from the fact that the inverse of a left step is@xmath123 while the inverse of a right step is @xmath124 so if we negate the middle @xmath125 components , the sequence reads the same from the end as from the beginning . to determine when we have arrived at the half - way point we look for symmetry :",
    "two adjacent or almost adjacent ( separated by one ) quadratic forms which differ only in the sign of the middle term .",
    "the central symmetry allows us to identify when the _ negative _ pell equation @xmath126 is soluble , and give a positive solution for it , if such exists .",
    "this will happen when the central part of the sequence looks like@xmath127    in that case @xmath57 can be written as @xmath128 with @xmath28 of the form@xmath129 so that its second column gives @xmath130 satisfying @xmath131    for the @xmath91 case , ( [ d2 ] ) shows that @xmath132 giving @xmath133 .",
    "the @xmath113 case does not have this form , and indeed @xmath134 has no solutions , as @xmath135 is not a square mod @xmath136    we will further exploit this palindromic phenomenon in our last example .",
    "the pell s equation @xmath138 was recognized by fermat as being particularly challenging , and he posed it as a problem to his contemporaries , which was subsequently solved by euler . however according to @xcite the eleventh century indian mathematician bhaskara solved this problem .",
    "we shorten the presentation by combining powers of @xmath5 and @xmath6 when convenient .",
    "the required sequence of left and right steps exhibits an additional doubly palindromic aspect , in that each half is itself palindromic in an opposite way , that is with @xmath5 and @xmath6 symbols interchanged:@xmath139 computation of the required matrix @xmath57 is shortened by the doubly palindromic aspect : @xmath140 and its first column gives the smallest non - trivial solution @xmath141 and @xmath142 the occurrence of @xmath143 in the middle of the sequence shows that the negative pell equation has a solution , and indeed the second column of @xmath144 satisfies @xmath145",
    "the previous example suggests that for large @xmath146 it is more efficient to work out how many _ successive _ @xmath6 or @xmath5 steps are needed at each stage . since @xmath147 it is easy to compute that for arbitrary natural numbers @xmath148 and @xmath149@xmath150",
    "so if a right step @xmath6 is needed , namely if @xmath151 then we find the smallest @xmath152 so that @xmath153 and choose @xmath154 if a left step @xmath5 is needed , namely if @xmath155 then we find the smallest @xmath156 so that @xmath157 and choose @xmath158    so for example at the first stage of the @xmath137 case , @xmath159 has a total of @xmath160 and since @xmath161 first when @xmath162 we set @xmath163 , giving@xmath164 now we know the next step must be @xmath165 for some @xmath149 and we compute that @xmath166 first when @xmath167 so that @xmath168 giving @xmath169 and so on .",
    "the stern - brocot tree ( see @xcite for a thorough discussion ) is generated from the two ` fractions ' @xmath170 and @xmath171 by repeatedly performing the mediant operation .",
    "it naturally associates binary sequences in @xmath5 and @xmath172 with strictly positive reduced fractions , as shown for the correspondence @xmath173    sternbrocottree2.eps + the stern brocot tree [ sb ]    the stern - brocot tree is closely related to the euclidean algorithm and the theory of continued fractions , and there is a useful alternate form which contains @xmath29 matrices instead of fractions . the matrix corresponding to a fraction @xmath174 has columns which are the two immediate left and right predecessors of @xmath174 in the original tree , and whose columns sum to give the fraction , regarded as a vector .",
    "a binary sequence of @xmath5 s and @xmath6 s can be directly translated to a matrix by interpreting @xmath5 and @xmath6 to be the two matrices we used earlier , and simply performing the matrix multiplication .",
    "so computing @xmath57 in the pell s equation solution amounts to following a path in the matrix form of the stern - brocot tree .",
    "each step involves adding one of the existing columns to the other , either to the left or to the right .",
    "shown is the case@xmath175 which occurred in the solution of @xmath176    sternbrocottreematrices2.eps + matrix form of the stern - brocot tree [ sb2 ]",
    "we have been able to avoid irrationalities because numbers of the form @xmath177 behave arithmetically exactly as do matrices of the form@xmath178 this will be familiar to most readers in the imaginary case of @xmath179 but it holds more generally , see for example @xcite .",
    "it allows us to consider a quadratic extension of the rationals not only as a subfield of the complex numbers , but also as _ a field of rotation / dilation operators _ on a two - dimensional ( non - euclidean ) geometry _ purely over the rational numbers_.    the usual approach to metrical geometry is to consider distance and angle as the fundamental concepts , but this is neither in the original spirit of the ancient greeks , nor an approach that lends itself easily to generalization .",
    "taking the _ quadrance _ @xmath180 as the fundamental measurement , instead of its square root , together with an algebraic replacement of angle called the",
    "_ spread _ between two lines , allows the development of a euclidean theory of geometry that extends both to general fields , and also to arbitrary quadratic forms .",
    "in particular there is a very rich theory of euclidean geometry over the rational numbers !    this new _ universal geometry _",
    "is described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our discussion of pell s equation thus has a direct _ geometric interpretation _ ( actually this is the context in which it was discovered)_. _",
    "so for example the matrix @xmath181 in the case of @xmath113 amounts to a _ rotation _ in the geometry for which _ _  quadrance _ _ is defined by @xmath182 .",
    "finally we point out that a quadratic irrational number such as @xmath183 manifests itself as a periodic infinite path down the stern - brocot tree .",
    "a more general irrational number can be defined as a more general infinite path down the stern - brocot tree .",
    "this approach to the definition of irrationalities has the significant advantages that it involves no ambiguities related to equivalences , and that the initial paths of an irrational give automatically the best rational approximations to it ."
