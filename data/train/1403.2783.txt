    "galaxy structure is one of the fundamental ways in which galaxy properties are described and by which galaxy evolution is inferred .",
    "there is a long history of the development of this idea , which began with the earliest observations of galaxies , and continues up to the modern day as one of the major ways we study galaxies .",
    "this review gives a detailed description of the progress made up to late-2013 in using galaxy structure to understand galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "it is meant to be used as a primer for obtaining basic information from galaxy structures , including how they are measured and applied through cosmic time .    the introduction to this review first gives an outline of the basic events in the history of galaxy morphology and structure analyses , while the second part of the introduction describes how galaxy structure fits into the general picture of galaxy formation .",
    "i also give a detailed description of the goals of this review at the end of the introduction .",
    "galaxy morphology has a long history , one that even predates the time we knew galaxies were extragalactic .",
    "when objects which today we call galaxies were first observed what clearly distinguished them from stars was their resolved structure .",
    "since this time , structure and morphology has remained one of the most common ways galaxies are described and studied .",
    "initially this involved visual impressions of galaxy forms .",
    "this has now been expanded to include quantitative methods to measure galaxy structures all the way back to the earliest galaxies we can currently see .",
    "the first published descriptions of galaxy structure and morphology predates the telescopic era .",
    "for example , the andromeda nebula was described as a small cloud by the persian astronomer abd al - rahman al - sufi in the 10th century , ( kepple & sanner 1998 ) .",
    "the study of galaxies remained descriptive until the late 20th century , although more and more detail was resolved as technology improved .",
    "as a result , for about 150 years the science of galaxies was necessarily restricted to cataloging and general descriptions of structure , with notable achievements by messier and william and john herschel who located galaxies or ` nebula ' by their resolve structure as seen by eye .",
    "even before photography revolutionized the study of galaxies some observers such as william parsons , the 3rd earl of rosse , noted that the nebulae have a spiral morphology and first used this term to describe galaxies , most notably and famously in the case of m51 .",
    "it was however the advent of photography that astronomers could in earnest begin to study the morphologies and structures of external galaxies .",
    "the most notable early schemes were developed by wolf ( 1908 ) , and lundmark ( 1926 ) , among others .",
    "this ultimately led to what is today called the hubble classification which was published in essentially its modern form in hubble ( 1926 ) , with the final hubble tuning fork established in hubble ( 1936 ) and sandage ( 1961 ) . the basic hubble sequence ( figure  1 )",
    "consists of two main types of galaxies , ellipticals and spirals , with a further division of spirals into those with bars and those without bars .",
    "hubble , and the astronomers who followed him , could classify most nearby bright galaxies in terms of this system .",
    "the development of morphological classification methods continued into the 20th century , with newer methodologies based solely on visual impressions .",
    "for example ,",
    "de vaucouleurs ( 1959 ) developed a revised version of the hubble sequence which included criteria such as as bars , rings and other internal features that were prominent on photographic plates of galaxies .",
    "likewise , van den bergh ( 1960 , 1976 ) , and later elmegreen & elmegreen ( 1987 ) developed a system to classify galaxies based on the form of spiral arms , and the apparent clumpiness of the light in these arms .",
    "while it is important to classify galaxies visually , and all systems have some use , as all features should be explained by physics , it is not obvious which structural features of galaxies are fundamental to their formation history",
    ". ultimately morphology and structure needs to prove to be useful for understanding galaxies , as there is now extensive use of photometric and spectroscopic methods permitting measurements of perhaps more fundamental measures of stellar populations and dust / gas properties in galaxies .",
    "along these lines , at roughly the same time as progressively complicated classification systems were developed , astronomers such as holmberg ( 1958 ) established that physical properties of nearby galaxies correlate with morphology in a broad context .",
    "holmberg ( 1958 ) found that ellipticals are typically massive and red , and show little star formation , while spirals are less massive , bluer and have evidence for ongoing star formation .",
    "this quantitatively expands into other physical parameters as well ( e.g. , roberts 1963 ; roberts & haynes 1994 ; conselice 2006a ; allen et al . 2006 ) .",
    "it is also well known that this segregation of morphology in the local universe provides an important clue for understanding the physics of galaxy formation , especially as local environment is found to strongly correlate with a galaxy s morphology ( e.g. , dressler 1984 ; see  4.7 ) .",
    "a revolution in morphological and structurally studies came about with the advent of photometric photometry , and especially the later use of charged coupled devices ( ccd ) , which made detailed quantitative measurements of light distributions in galaxies possible . the first major contribution from this type of work was by de vaucouleurs ( 1948 ) who used photometry to show that the light profiles of what we would identify today as massive ellipticals all follow roughly the same fundamental light distribution , known as the de vaucouleurs profile .",
    "this was later expanded by others , most notably srsic ( 1963 ) , who demonstrated that a more general form of light distributions matched galaxy light profiles with disks having exponential light profiles , while the light distribution within massive ellipticals generally following the de vaucouleurs profile .",
    "this has led to a huge industry in measuring the light profiles of galaxies in the nearby and distant universe which continues today (  2.2 ) .    during the 1970s and 1980s",
    "the study of galaxy structure expanded to include the decomposition of galaxy light into bulge and disk profiles ( e.g. , kormendy 1977 ) as well as features such as bars , rings and lenses ( e.g. , kormendy 1979 ; de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "the three dimensional structure of disk galaxies was investigated ( e.g. , van der kruit & searle 1982 ) , as well as detailed studies of bulges and disk in spiral systems ( e.g. , de jong 1996 ; peletier & balcells 1996 ) .",
    "we also now know there is a great diversity in elliptical galaxy internal structures ( e.g. , kormendy et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "similar investigations demonstrated that secular evolution within disks can provide an explanation for how bars , rings and lenses can form ( e.g. , kormendy 1979 ; combes & sanders 1981 ) .",
    "these effects , not driven by hierarchical galaxy formation , are also likely responsible for the formation of pseudo - bulges and may drive the formation of central massive black holes ( e.g. , kormendy & kennicutt 2004 ; sellwood 2013 ) .    while there is a large amount of work done on the structures and morphologies of galaxies in the nearby universe ( e.g. , see kormendy et al .",
    "2009 ; buta 2013 ) , it is difficult to investigate more than the very basics of structure and morphology when studying distant galaxies .",
    "this is due to the fact that current technology does not allow us to resolve these distant galaxies in the same detail as we can for closer systems .",
    "as such , this review will concentrate on the features and properties of galaxy structure which we can measure in distant galaxies , and how this reveals how galaxy evolution and formation occurs .",
    "the result of this is that one of the areas where galaxy structure and morphology has made its biggest impact is its ability to measure fundamental properties of distant galaxies that we can compare with nearby galaxies to determine evolution .",
    "there are extensive methods for studying galaxy evolution which galaxy structure analyses are becoming an essential aspect of , and providing unique information on , the history and physics of galaxy assembly , which i detail in this review .      we know that there is significant evolution in galaxies over time as the stellar mass density of galaxies evolves rapidly at @xmath7 , with about half of all stellar mass formed by @xmath8 ( e.g. , bundy et al . 2005 ; mortlock et al . 2011 ) .",
    "we also know that there is a vast diversity of star formation histories for individual galaxies , and that the integrated star formation rate density in the universe s history peaks at @xmath9 , and declines at higher and lower redshifts ( e.g. , shapley 2011 ; madau & dickinson 2014 , this volume ) . however , it is not clear from these observations what are / were the driving forces creating galaxies .",
    "theory offers several approaches for understanding how galaxies form which detailed studies are starting to probe .",
    "we now believe that galaxy formation can happen in a number of ways .",
    "this includes : in - situ star formation in a collapsed galaxy , major and minor mergers , and gas accretion from the intergalactic medium .",
    "galaxy structure and morphology are perhaps the best ways to trace these processes , as i discuss in this review .    another major question",
    "i address in this review is how do the structures and morphologies of galaxies change through cosmic time .",
    "major issues that this topic allows us to address include : the formation history of the hubble sequence ; whether galaxies form in - side - out or out - side - in ? ; how long does a galaxy retain its morphology ? ; is morphology a invariant quantity in a galaxy over a long cosmic time - span ? , and furthermore what relative role does star formation and merging play in galaxy formation ?",
    "galaxy structure and morphology has made a significant impact on these questions largely due to the hubble space telescope ( hst ) and its various deep field campaigns starting in the mid-1990s , finding thousands of galaxies at redshifts @xmath10 within these images .",
    "this is complemented by extensive imaging and spectroscopy for nearby galaxies carried out by surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and the millennium galaxy catalog ( e.g. , shen et al .",
    "2003 ; de propris et al . 2007 ) .",
    "combining these surveys makes it possible to study in detail the structures of distant galaxies , and to compare these with structures at different redshifts .",
    "this has led to a renaissance in the analysis of galaxy structure , including parametric fitting using srsic profiles , and the development of non - parametric measurements of galaxy structure that have allowed us to use galaxy morphology / structure as a tool for deciphering how galaxy assembly occurs over cosmic time .",
    "we are in fact now able to resolve galaxies back to redshifts @xmath11 with imaging from space , and recently as well with adaptive optics from the ground ( e.g. , conselice & arnold 2009 ; carrasco et al .",
    "2010 ; akiyama et al .",
    "this reveals that galaxy structure is significantly different in the early universe from what it is today , and that there is a progression from the highest redshifts , where galaxies are small , peculiar , and undergoing high star formation rates to the relative quiescent galaxies that we find in the nearby universe .",
    "how this change occurs , and what it implies for galaxy evolution , is another focus of this review .",
    "another ultimate goal is to describe the methods for measuring galaxy structure and morphology for nearby galaxies up to the most distant ones we can see .",
    "i also discuss how galaxy structure correlates with physical properties of galaxies , such as their star formation rate , merging and their overall scale .",
    "i then provide a description of the observed structural evolution of galaxies , and a discussion of what this implies for the driving mechanisms behind galaxy formation using the calibrated methods .",
    "the amount of information we have about the structures and properties of galaxies declines as one goes to higher redshift systems , and issues that arise due to observational bias must be dealt with .",
    "i therefore also discuss systematics that can be addressed through imaging simulations to determine the real evolution of the morphologies and structures of galaxies .",
    "i finish this review with a discussion of future uses of galaxy structure / morphology , including the potential with the advent of jwst and euclid .",
    "this review is structured as follows . in ",
    "2 , i describe the analysis methods used for measuring the morphologies and structures of galaxies . in  3",
    "i describe how structures and morphologies reveal fundamental galaxy properties and evolutionary processes , while  4 describes the observed evolution of the structures of galaxies through cosmic time .",
    "i finish this review with a description of how galaxy structure and evolution is becoming an important aspect for understanding the underlying theory of galaxy formation and cosmology in  5 and give a summary and future outlook in  6 .",
    "in this section i describe the various ways in which galaxy structure is measured and quantified for comparisons across all redshifts .",
    "there are a great diversity of nearby galaxy properties that can not be examined at high redshift , and this review only concentrates on that general features that can be measured .",
    "this includes the traditional approach of using visual estimates to classify galaxies into morphological types , as well as quantitative methods .",
    "visual methods has had a resurgence with the advent of citizen science projects such as galaxy zoo which provides online tools for non - scientists to classify over a million galaxies ( lintott et al .",
    "2011 ) as well as large hubble space telescope projects such as candels ( e.g. , kocevski et al . 2011 ; kartaltepe et al .",
    "the bulk of this section however describes the quantitative methods for measuring galaxy structure , and the limitations to this approach .",
    "the interpretation of what these measurements imply are discussed in  3 and  4 .",
    "the classic approach towards understanding the structures of galaxies is through their apparent visual morphology .",
    "the major system of classification in use today has a development through hubble ( 1926 ) , de vaucouleurs ( 1959 ) and sandage ( 1961 , 1975 ) as outlined briefly in the introduction .",
    "modern reviews of galaxy classification by eye into visual types can be found in buta ( 2013 ) .",
    "when studying the morphologies of distant galaxies the visual classifications can only be placed into a few limited and well defined classes : spirals , ellipticals , and irregular / peculiars .",
    "the spirals can be further subdivided into spirals with or without a bar . in this",
    "review peculiars are interpreted as mergers of two preexisting galaxies , while irregulars are lower mass galaxies that contain a semi - random pattern of star formation , such as is seen in magellanic irregulars .",
    "typically these irregulars are too faint to be seen at high redshifts and therefore are not considered in this review in any detail .",
    "visual morphological classifications has been performed on nearly all deep hubble space telescope imaging starting from its earliest days ( e.g. , dressler et al .",
    "1994 ; van den bergh et al . 1996 ) .",
    "this has continued with deeper and deeper hst observations , including those that sample the rest - frame optical in the near - infrared ( e.g. , mortlock et al .",
    "2013 ; lee et al .",
    "there are however some limitations to how these classifications can be used at higher redshifts , as it is not clear how the apparent morphology of a galaxy will change due to redshift effects , rather than real evolution (  2.3.5 ) .",
    "there is also the issue that galaxies which look elliptical or disky do not have the same characteristics as systems with the same morphologies seen nearby (  4.1 ) .",
    "it is clear that the properties of distant galaxies that look elliptical and disky do not have the same physical properties as systems with the corresponding morphology in the nearby universe .",
    "features such as sizes , light profiles , colors and star formation rates differ within the same galaxy morphological type through time ( e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "2011 ; mortlock et al . 2013",
    "; buitrago et al .",
    "therefore , throughout this review a morphological type is only a visual determination of how a galaxy looks , and does not predispose to a certain local galaxy type or template , or to ascribe a certain formation history or scale .",
    "historically one of the first ways in which galaxy structure was quantified was through the use of integrated light profiles .",
    "these profiles are simply measured by taking the average intensity of a galaxy at a given radius , and then determining how this intensity changes as a function of radius .",
    "this was first described in detail by de vaucouleurs ( 1948 ) who used the measurements of light from photometry at different apertures for ellipticals and proposed a fitting form . a similar but",
    "more general form was found to better explain the surface brightness profiles by srsic ( 1963 ) for different types of galaxies ,    @xmath12    where the shape of the profile is described by the srsic index , @xmath13 , and the value of @xmath14 is determined such that @xmath15 is the effective radius , containing half of the light within the galaxy and is a function of the index @xmath13 .",
    "the standard canonical benchmarks are that the de vaucouleurs profile is given by @xmath16 , and exponential disks by @xmath17 . in principle",
    ", the values of @xmath13 and @xmath15 are used as fundamental and first order structural parameters of galaxies .",
    "the use of the srsic profile to describe nearby galaxies is extensive ( e.g. , kormendy et al .",
    "2009 ) , and it has more recently been applied to distant galaxies , as we discuss in  4.2 . for reviews on the use of resolve photometry through surface brightness profiles to study",
    "early type galaxies see e.g. , kormendy & djorgovski ( 1989 ) , allen et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , simard et al .",
    "( 2011 )    recently the fitting of galaxy two dimensional profiles with various forms such as the srsic , exponential and de vaucouleurs profile is done through the galfit code by peng et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , as well as gim2d by simard et al .",
    "these allow a simple and quick method for measuring the light profiles and radii of many galaxies , providing data for understanding the evolution of galaxy structure .",
    "this allows for the measurements of different light components at high - z , although these codes and other similar ones , have limitations such as a constant ellipticity assumption within a given component , but are sufficient for gross measures of galaxy structure .",
    "another more recent measurement technique involves the non - parametric method of measuring galaxy light distributions .",
    "non - parametric methods of measuring galaxy structure began in the photographic era with attempts to quantify the light concentration in galaxies by morgan ( 1962 ) , although extensive quantitative measures were not done until the mid-1990s .",
    "the development of methods to measure the light structures of galaxies began in earnest when the first deep images of distant galaxies were obtained with the hubble space telescope ( shade et al .",
    "1995 ; abraham et al .",
    "1996 ) although their use for low redshift measurements was also noted at about the same time , although in terms of a physical property rather than a descriptive quantity ( e.g. , rix & zaritsky 1995 ; conselice 1997 ; bershady et al .",
    "2000 ; conselice et al .",
    "2000a , b ) .",
    "these early papers show that quantitative galaxy structure correlates with other parameters , such as color and peculiar features indicating mergers or galaxy interactions ( e.g. , rix & zaritsky 1995 ; conselice 1997 ; conselice et al .",
    "2000a ) .",
    "at present , the most common methods for measuring galaxy structure in a non - parametric way is through the cas system ( e.g. , conselice 2003 ;  2.3.1 - 2.3.3 ) and through similar parameters ( takamiya 1999 ; papovich et al .",
    "2003 , 2005 ; abraham et al .",
    "2003 ; lotz et al .",
    "2004 ; law et al . 2007 ;",
    "freeman et al . 2013 ) .",
    "these parameters are designed to capture the major features of the underlying structures of these galaxies , but in a way that does not involve assumptions about the underlying form , as is done with the srsic fitting (  2.2 ) .",
    "these non - parametric parameters are also measurable out to high redshifts , making them ideal for deriving galaxy evolution over many epochs , as we discuss in  4 .",
    "i give a brief description for how these parameters are measured .",
    "typically , as we discuss below , corrections must be applied to account for noise , and to use a reproducible radius ( e.g. , bershady et al .",
    "2000 ; conselice et al .",
    "this radius issue has been addressed in detail by e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "( 2000a ) , bershady et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and graham et al .",
    "the radius typically used in these measures is the petrosian radius , which is defined as the location where the ratio of surface brightness at a radius , @xmath18 , divided by the surface brightness within the radius @xmath19 , reaches some value , which is denoted by @xmath20 ( petrosian 1976 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath21 changes from @xmath22 at the center of a galaxy , down to @xmath23 when the light from the galaxy is zero at its outer edge.    this method of measuring the radius is much less influenced by surface brightness dimming than other methods such as using an isophotal radius , and is therefore useful for measuring the same physical parts of galaxies at different redshifts ( e.g. , petrosian 1976 ; bershady et al . 2000 ;",
    "graham et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the mathematical form for this radius is given by    @xmath24    where most observables in non - parametric morphologies are measured at a radius which corresponds to the location where @xmath25 , or a relatively small multiplicative factor of this radius ( often 1.5 times ) ( e.g. , bershady et al .",
    "2000 ; conselice 2003 ; lotz et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "one of the more commonly used indices is the asymmetry index(@xmath2 ) which is a measure of how asymmetric a galaxy is after rotating along the line of sight center axis of the galaxy by 180 deg ( figure  2 ) .",
    "it can be thought of as an indicator of what fraction of the light in a galaxy is in non - symmetric components .",
    "the basic formula for calculating the asymmetry index ( @xmath2 ) is given by :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 represents is the original galaxy image , @xmath28 is the image after rotating it from its center by 180 .",
    "the measurement of the asymmetry parameter however involves several steps beyond this simple measure .",
    "this includes carefully dealing with the background noise in the same way that the galaxy itself is by using a blank background area ( @xmath29 ) , and finding the location for the center of rotation . the radius is usually defined as the petrosian radius at which @xmath25 , although once out to large radius the measured parameters are remarkably stable .    operationally , the area @xmath29 is a blank part of the sky near the galaxy .",
    "the center of rotation is not defined a priori , but is measured through an iterative process whereby the value of the asymmetry is calculated at the initial central guess ( usually the geometric center or light centroid ) and then the asymmetry is calculated around this central guess using some fraction of a pixel difference .",
    "this is repeated until a global minimum is found ( conselice et al .",
    "2000a ) .",
    "typical asymmetry values for nearby galaxies are discussed in conselice ( 2003 ) with ellipticals having values @xmath30 , while spiral galaxies are found in the range from @xmath31 , while for ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , which are often mergers , the average is @xmath32 , and for merging starbursts @xmath33 ( conselice 2003 ) .",
    "table  1 lists the typical asymmetry and other cas values ( conselice 2003 ) .",
    "quantitative structural values for the same galaxy can also differ significantly between wavelengths .",
    "this is important for measuring these parameters at higher redshifts , where often the rest - frame optical can not be probed , an issue we discuss in more detail in  2.3.5 .",

    "it is a very simple index in this regard , and it is similar to , and correlates strongly with , srsic @xmath13 values , which are also a measure of the light concentration in a galaxy .",
    "there are many ways of measuring the concentration , including taking ratios of radii which contain a certain fraction of light , as well as the ratio of the amount of light at two given radii ( e.g. , bershady et al . 2000 ; graham et al .",
    "these radii are often defined by the total amount of light measured within some petrosian radius , often at the same location as used for the measuring the asymmetry index .",
    "the definition most commonly used is the ratio of two circular radii which contain a inner and outer fraction ( 20% and 80% or 30% and 70% are the most common ) ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) of the total galaxy flux ( figure  2 ) ,    @xmath37    a higher value of @xmath1 indicates that a larger amount of light in a galaxy is contained within a central region .",
    "the concentration index however has to be measured very carefully , as different regions and radii used can produce very different values that systematically do not reproduce well when observed under degraded conditions ( e.g. , graham et al . 2001 ; graham et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the clumpiness ( or smoothness ) ( @xmath3 ) parameter is used to describe the fraction of light in a galaxy which is contained in clumpy distributions .",
    "clumpy galaxies have a relatively large amount of light at high spatial frequencies , whereas smooth systems , such as elliptical galaxies contain light at low spatial frequencies .",
    "galaxies which are undergoing star formation tend to have very clumpy structures , and thus high @xmath3 values .",
    "clumpiness can be measured in a number of ways , the most common method used , as described in conselice ( 2003 ) is ,    @xmath38,\\ ] ]    where , the original image @xmath39 is blurred to produce a secondary image , @xmath40 ( figure  2 ) . this blurred image",
    "is then subtracted from the original image leaving a residual map , containing only high frequency structures in the galaxy ( conselice 2003 ) .",
    "the size of the smoothing kernel @xmath41 is determined by the radius of the galaxy , and the value @xmath42 gives the best signal for nearby systems ( conselice 2003 ) .",
    "note that the centers of galaxies are removed when this procedure is carried out as they often contain unresolved high - spatial frequency light .",
    "figure  3 shows a diagram for how these three cas parameters are measured on a typical nearby spiral galaxy .",
    "furthermore , the cas parameters can be combined together to create a 3-dimension space in which different galaxy types can be classified .",
    "for example , figure  3 shows the concentration vs. asymmetry vs. clumpiness diagram , demonstrating how these parameters can be used to determine morphological types of galaxies in the nearby universe in cas space .",
    "another popular structural measurement system is the gini / m@xmath4 parameters which are used in a similar way to the cas parameters to find galaxies of broad morphological types , especially galaxies undergoing mergers ( e.g. , abraham et al .",
    "2003 ; lotz et al .",
    "both of these parameters measure the relative distribution of light within pixels , and do not involve subtraction , as is used for the asymmetry and clumpiness parameters , and therefore in principle may be less sensitive to high levels of background noise ( e.g. , lotz et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the gini coefficient is a statistical tool originally used in economics to determine the distribution of wealth within a population , with higher values indicating a very unequal distribution ( gini of 1 would mean all wealth / light is in one person / pixel ) , while a lower value indicates it is distributed more evenly amongst the population ( gini of 0 would mean everyone / every pixel has an equal share ) .",
    "the value of g is defined by the lorentz curve of the galaxy s light distribution , which does not take into consideration spatial position .    in the calculation of these parameters ,",
    "each pixel is ordered by its brightness and counted as part of the cumulative distribution ( see lotz et al .",
    "2004 , 2008 ) . a galaxy in this case is considered a system with @xmath13 pixels each with a flux @xmath43 where @xmath44 ranges from 0 to @xmath13 . the gini coefficient is then measured by    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the average pixel flux value .",
    "the second order moment parameter , 20 , is similar to the concentration in that it gives a value that indicates whether light is concentrated within an image .",
    "however a m@xmath4 value denoting a high concentration ( a very negative value ) does not imply a central concentration , as in principle the light could be concentrated in any location in a galaxy .",

    "one of the major issues with non - parametric structural indices is that they will change for more distant galaxies , both due to any evolution but also due to distance effects , creating a smaller and fainter image of the same system .",
    "this must be accounted for when using galaxy structure as a measure of evolution ( e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "2000a ; conselice 2003 ; lisker 2008 ) .",
    "there are several ways to deal with this issue , which is similar to how corrections for point spread functions in parametric fitting or weak lensing analyses are done .",
    "the most common correction method for non - parametric parameters is to use image simulations .",
    "these simulations are such that nearby galaxies are reduced in resolution and surface brightness to match the redshift at which the galaxy is to be simulated at .",
    "these new simulated images are then placed into a background appropriate for the instrument and exposure time in which the simulation takes place ( conselice 2003 ) .",
    "the outline for how to do these simulations is provided in papers such as giavalisco et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and conselice ( 2003 ) amongst others .",
    "to give some idea of the difficultly in reproducing the morphologies and structures of galaxies , figure  4 shows simulated nearby early - type spirals as to how they would appear in wfc3 imaging data from the hubble ultra deep field ( conselice et al .",
    "what can be clearly seen is that it is difficult , and sometimes even impossible , to make out features of these galaxies after they have been simulated .",
    "another issue when examining the structures of distant galaxies is that these systems will often be observed at bluer wavelengths than what is typically observed with in the nearby universe due to the effects of redshift .",
    "for example , pictures of galaxies at @xmath57 taken with wfpc2 and acs are all imaged in the rest - frame ultraviolet .",
    "figure  5 shows what rest - frame wavelength various popular filters probe as a function of redshift .",

    "1995 ; hibbard & vacca 1997 ; windhorst et al . 2002 ; taylor - mager et al .",
    "2007 ) although these morphologies are not significantly different for starbursting galaxies with little dust at both low and high redshift ( dickinson 2000 ; conselice et al .",
    "while it is clear that the cas method works better at distinguishing types at redder wavelengths ( e.g. , lanyon - foster et al .",

    "the process for accounting for the effects of image degradation is to measure the morphological index of interest at @xmath58 , and then to remeasure the same values at higher redshift after simulating . for the morphological k - correction",
    "the approach has been to measure the parameter of interest at different wavelengths , and to determine by interpolation the value at the rest - frame wavelength of interest .",
    "using the asymmetry index as an example , the final measure after correcting for redshift effects is ,    @xmath59    where @xmath60 is the ( usually negative ) morphological k - correction , @xmath61 is the ( positive ) correction for images degradation effects .",
    "other parameters can be measured the same way .",
    "this is a necessary correction to examine the evolution of a selected population at the same effective depth , resolution and rest - frame wavelength .",
    "the ultimate goal in this review is to trace how structure evolves over cosmic time , and using this as a method to decipher galaxy evolution . as such ,",
    "i present in this section work to date which describes how physical information is derived from galaxy structural parameters .",
    "the star formation process within galaxies is critical , as galaxies would not exist without stars in them .",
    "star formation is also one of the major criteria for classification within the hubble sequence .",
    "the effects of star formation has also been used to classify spiral galaxies into various classes ( e.g. , van den bergh 1976 ; elmegreen & elmegreen 1987 ) .",
    "star formation is an enormous topic with a large amount of work published ( e.g. , kennicutt 1998 ; kennicutt & evans 2012 ; madau & dickinson 2014 ) , and we thus limit our discussion to how star formation and galaxy structure are related .",
    "the integrated star formation density evolution of galaxies in the universe has been studied in detail and is now well characterized .",
    "the integrated star formation rate increases from a low initial value at @xmath62 to a peak at @xmath63 , and thereafter declines . at higher redshifts",
    "@xmath6 there is also a well defined relation between star formation rate and stellar mass , such that higher mass galaxies have a higher rate of star formation ( e.g. , noeske et al . 2007 ;",
    "bauer et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "this is important as galaxies undergoing star formation can have very different morphologies and structures from passive galaxies .",
    "examples of this include : clumpy spiral arms , knots of star formation , central bright starbursts , etc .",
    "this can be seen for example when viewing local galaxies , whereby those with star formation appear clumpier and more asymmetric than those without star formation .    furthermore ,",
    "there are also morphological k - correction effects , such that star forming galaxies have a smaller difference in their morphology between ultra - violet through optical and near - infrared light ( e.g. , windhorst et al . 2002 ; taylor - mager et al .",
    "this generally reveals that at shorter wavelengths the morphologies and quantitative structures are tracing the distribution of star formation directly . at optical wavelengths longer than the balmer break , we are sampling a mixture of stars at different ages , with older ages dominating the seds at longer wavelengths .",
    "there are also very dusty galaxies such as sub - mm sources and ulirgs which can have a significant fraction of their optical light absorbed ( e.g. , calzetti et al . 2000 ) .",
    "it is not just apparently morphology which is affected by star formation , but also the quantitative structure .",
    "it is well known that star forming galaxies without significant dust are quite blue , but the effects of star formation can also be seen in their structure .",
    "quantitative measurements of structure strongly correlates with the star formation rate within galaxies as measured by the correlation between the clumpiness index ( @xmath3 ) and the h@xmath64 equivalent width ( conselice 2003 ) .",
    "this is also seen in more asymmetric and clumpy light distributions within h@xmath64 imaging of nearby galaxies , and when examining the light distribution at 24 @xmath65 m imaging using spitzer space telescope imaging ( e.g. , bendo et al .",
    "conselice ( 2003 ) calibrate how the clumpiness index can be used as a measure of star formation , and conselice et al .",
    "( 2000a ) show that asymmetry values correlate strongly with ( b - v ) color for nearby galaxies .",
    "one of the primary physical effects that can be seen in the structures of galaxies is when two galaxies merge or interact with each other .",
    "when these dynamical events occur the structures of these systems often become very peculiar and distorted , especially when the merging galaxies contain a similar amount of mass in a major merger we have learned much about nearby galaxy mergers , such as ulirgs ( e.g. , joseph & wright 1985 ; sanders & mirabel 1996 ) , as well as through numerical simulations ( e.g. , mihos & hernquist ( 1996 ) that have shown convincingly that peculiar galaxies are often mergers ( toomre & toomre 1972 ) .",
    "this demonstrates that there is a strong correlation between structure and this fundamental galaxy formation process .",
    "early measurements of galaxy lopsidedness through fourier decomposition of structure , and by using the asymmetry parameter , measured on nearby galaxies found a correlation with the presence of interacting or merging neighbors ( e.g. , rix & zaritsky 1995 ; conselice 1997 ; reichard et al .",
    "as such , galaxy structure is a powerful method for determining whether a galaxy is undergoing a recent major merger . this has been measured in many ways , from using visual estimates of mergers based on peculiar structures to more quantitative results .",
    "one automatic method for finding mergers is the cas approach ( conselice 2003 ) where merging galaxies are those with a high asymmetry , which is also higher than the value of the clumpiness .",
    "the simple condition :    @xmath66    accounts for a large fraction , but not all , of local galaxies which are mergers ",
    "i.e. , ulirgs and starbursts in mergers ( see figure  3 ) . while the contamination from non - mergers is fairly low at a few percent ,",
    "the fraction of actual mergers which are identified is roughly 50% ( conselice 2003 ) .",
    "this is largely due to the fact that galaxies involved in the merger process are only quantitatively asymmetric for about a third of the life - time of the merger ( see  3.4 ) .",
    "there is also the relationship found by lotz et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for locating major mergers using gini / m@xmath4 parameters is given by ,    @xmath67    a more recent criteria developed by freeman et al .",
    "( 2013 ) uses multi - mode ( @xmath54 ) , intensity ( @xmath55 ) , and deviation ( @xmath56 ) statistics to quantify which galaxies are mergers .",
    "this study shows that a higher fraction of real mergers can be found using these indices compared with cas or gini / m@xmath4 .",
    "one ultimate result of finding these mergers is that it allows us to calculate the merger fraction within a population of galaxies .",
    "the basic merger fraction ( @xmath68 ) is calculated as the number of mergers selected within a given redshift bin and stellar mass limit ( or luminosity cut ) ( @xmath69 ) , divided by the total number of galaxies within the same redshift and stellar mass selection ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "the merger fraction is thus defined as :    @xmath71    this merger fraction is also a function of stellar mass and redshift .",
    "the cas mergers are nearly all major mergers ( conselice 2003 , 2006b ; lotz et al .",
    "2008 ) , whereas gini / m@xmath4 measures all types of mergers , both minor and major .    furthermore for structural samples we are calculating the merger fraction , as opposed to the galaxy merger fraction .",
    "the difference is important when comparing with pair studies where the two progenitors can be resolved .",
    "the difference between these two is subtle , but important .",
    "the merger fraction considers a merger as having already happened , with the two galaxies that have merged now counted as a single system .",
    "the galaxy merger fraction is the fraction calculated when both of these galaxies merging are considered as two separate galaxies , which they were before the final merger .",
    "the galaxy merger fraction ( @xmath72 ) is thus the number of galaxies merging , where a system which has already condensed into a single galaxy is counted as two galaxies , divided by the number of galaxies in the total sample . for small merger fractions",
    "this ratio is about a factor of two larger than the merger fraction which counts only the merger remnants ( conselice 2006b ) .",
    "the equation to derive the galaxy merger fraction with observables through morphology , with the assumption that every merging galaxy has exactly two progenitor galaxies is given by ,    @xmath73    this relation does not hold if a merger occurs with more than two galaxies ( conselice 2006b ) although these are very rare ( de propris et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the morphological measurement of the nearby merger fraction gives values of @xmath68 = 0.01 ( de propris et al .",
    "a discussion of the measurement of this at higher redshifts is included  4.3 .",
    "one of the interesting facts about galaxies is that many of their characteristics can be explained by an underlying property , which is likely its halo or total mass ( caon et al .",
    "1993 ; disney et al .",
    "2008 ) . as an example",
    ", it was noted early on that galaxy light profile shapes of ellipticals correlated strongly with the radius or magnitude of a galaxy ( e.g. , caon et al .",
    "this implies that the scale or mass of an elliptical galaxy has an influence on a galaxy s overall light profile and shape .",
    "this can also be seen in the detailed structures of galaxies .",
    "in general it appears that on average galaxies with a higher degree of central concentration have larger total or stellar masses .",
    "this is also seen in the concentration index , which is another measure of the degree of light concentration , with more massive galaxies having a higher value of concentration ( e.g. , conselice 2003 ) .",
    "this concentration also correlates with the fraction of light in bulge and disk components .",
    "this relation is such that the more concentrated a galaxy is , the less likely it will contain a significant disk ( e.g. , conselice 2003 ) .",
    "in fact , it is likely that it is the fraction of bulge light which drives this correlation , with more massive systems more likely to have significant and concentrated bulges .",
    "concentration also separates galaxies with different star formation histories in the local and high redshift universe . in a study using the sloan digital sky survey",
    "( sdss ) strateva et al .",
    "( 2001 ) showed that non - star forming galaxies are more concentrated than star forming blue systems .",
    "this can also be seen with other overall galaxy properties ( e.g. , allen et al .",
    "2006 ; conselice 2006 ) .",
    "the light concentration for ellipticals also correlates with the mass of the central massive black hole ( e.g. , graham et al .",

    "2013 ) .",
    "simulations of galaxy formation are critical for interpreting and understanding the meaning of structural indices of galaxies . in fact , one of the first computer simulations of galaxy formation by toomre & toomre ( 1972 ) showed that the peculiar morphologies of galaxies seen in e.g. , the arp ( 1966 ) atlas were due to systems undergoing major mergers rather than some other cause .",
    "since then , numerical simulations of galaxies have proven an effective method for interpreting the structures and morphologies of galaxies in both the local universe and at higher redshifts . in many ways",
    "this approach towards understanding galaxy morphology has just begun and promises to be a powerful and effective approach for interpreting the meaning of structure in the future .",
    "mihos & hernquist ( 1996 ) was one of the first papers to demonstrate in detail how the peculiar galaxies seen in deep hst imaging were in fact due to the merger process using the treesph hydrodynamical method from hernquist & katz ( 1989 ) .",
    "interest in comparing simulated merger results with observables was largely in terms of starbursts and spectral energy distributions of galaxies ( e.g. , barnes & hernquist 1991 ) .",
    "however , some attempts were made even very early to use these merger n - body models as a method of interpreting hubble space telescope morphologies of galaxies ( mihos 1995 ) .    applying quantitative structural methods described in  2 to these numerical simulations of structural evolution",
    "was first carried out by conselice ( 2006b ) who used the cas method to calculate the time - scale of the merger process on dark - matter particle simulations , finding a merger time - scale of @xmath74 gyr for galaxies having a high enough asymmetry to be identified as an unambiguous merger (  3.2 ) .",
    "this time - scale is critical for interpreting galaxy merger fractions through cosmic time , as it allows us to convert merger fraction to merger rates , and thus derive how mergers are driving galaxy formation .",
    "using these results conselice ( 2006b ) measure that a typical galaxy undergoes 4.4@xmath75 mergers from @xmath5 to @xmath76 .",
    "conselice ( 2006b ) also show that the time when a merger is asymmetric is distributed throughout the merger process , and is not located at one particular time .",
    "nor would the merging systems always be identifiable as such when studied with the cas parameters .",
    "in addition to giving a robust time - scale , conselice ( 2006b ) also show that only a fraction ( about a 1/3 ) of a merging galaxy s time - sequence would be found through cas as a major merger .",
    "the time - scale derived is also largely independent of the viewing angle of the merger and an asymmetry signal is only present within major mergers with mass ratios of 1:3 or greater .",
    "the simulations used in conselice ( 2006b ) are however simple in that they do not include the effects of star formation or dust , which are well know to produce dramatic changes in morphology ( e.g , taylor - mager et al . 2007 ; ",

    "the above sections describe how we can measure the structures and morphologies of galaxies through various approaches , and the meaning of this structure . in this section",
    "i discuss how these measurements have been applied to galaxies at all redshifts to decipher how evolution is occurring within the galaxy population .",
    "when galaxies were first found in the distant universe , they were not resolved enough to study their structures and morphologies , and the evolution of galaxies was observationally driven by number counting and colors ( e.g. , koo & kron 1992 ) , with the faint blue galaxy excess problem at faint magnitudes dominating the field for twenty years , until redshifts for these systems became available ( e.g. , ellis 1997 ) .    the problem of galaxy evolution and formation is a large one , and this review does not focus on this question .",
    "however , galaxy structure and morphology reveals information that can not be provided by other methods .",
    "i do however give a brief overview here of the important questions in understanding galaxy evolution .",
    "for a general review of galaxy properties at @xmath87 see shapley ( 2011 ) for an observational perspective and silk & mamon ( 2012 ) for a theoretical one . for nearby galaxy",
    "s a few recent relevant reviews are blanton & moustakas ( 2009 ) , van der kruit & freeman ( 2011 ) , and conroy ( 2013 ) .",
    "galaxies are now studied up to redshifts @xmath88 , although at the highest redshifts less information is available .",
    "the most common measures for these distant galaxies are colors , stellar masses , star formation rates , sizes and basic structures . from this we know that the volume integrated star formation rate increases with time from these ultra - high redshifts until around @xmath63 when the star formation rate begins to decline ( see madau & dickinson 2014 , this volume ) .",
    "stellar mass measurements roughly agree with this picture , such that about half of all stellar mass is formed by @xmath89 ( e.g. , mortlock et al .",
    "galaxies are also much bluer in the past ( finkelstein et al .",
    "2012 ) , with some debate and uncertainty concerning the star formation history of individual galaxies and the relevant role and commonality of very old and/or very dusty galaxies at redshifts @xmath6 .",
    "what is largely unavailable from examining stellar masses , stellar populations and star formation histories is how these galaxies assembled .",
    "clearly galaxies are fed gas , or have very large gas reservoirs in them to sustain and produce star formation .",
    "how this gas gets into galaxies is a fundamental question , as is the relative role of mergers vs. star formation in forming galaxies . since the number of massive galaxies at high redshifts is a factor of ten or so less than those today",
    ", clearly much evolution and formation in these systems has occurred .",
    "galaxy structure provides a way to examine this problem , as it permits us to determine which modes of galaxy formation are active within a galaxy .",
    "the first and by far the most common method is to study the merger history through the techniques described in  3.2 .",
    "another method is to simply examine the visual morphologies of galaxies to determine when the hubble sequence is in place , and after combining with color , size and star formation rates , to determine when spirals and ellipticals are roughly in their current form .",
    "in particular the examination of the sizes of galaxies has provided a very puzzling evolution such that galaxies of similar masses are up to a factor of 2 - 5 times smaller than corresponding galaxies seen today ( e.g. , buitrago et al .",
    "2008 ; cassata et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "furthermore , resolved imaging allows us to study the formation history of individual components of galaxies , such as disks , bulges , spiral arms , clumps of star formation , etc which reveals formation information not available when examining the galaxy as a whole .",
    "this section , which is the heart of this review article , provides the current observational evidence for morphological and structural evolution and what it implies for galaxy formation .",
    "the first science result i discuss is how the visual hubble sequence evolves throughout the universe .",
    "this can simply be restated as measuring the number density and relative fractions of galaxy types at a given selection , which are classified as ellipticals , spirals and peculiars . as mentioned earlier",
    ", we do not consider irregulars as these are typically lower mass galaxies that are not detected at high redshift due to their faintness .",
    "it is also largely impossible to use finer classifications , such as sa or sb , on distant galaxies , as the resolution is not good enough , even with hubble space telescope imaging , to resolve this type of detail .",
    "more distant galaxies also appear to be quite different from hubble types , making this type of detailed morphologies unnecessary and undesirable ( e.g. , conselice 2005 ) .",
    "this relates to a fundamental question that has been asked since galaxies were discovered , which is whether or not a galaxy retains its morphology over a long period of cosmic time .",
    "otherwise , if morphological transformations do occur , what processes drive this ( internal or external ) , and how often does a galaxy change its morphology ?",
    "one of the first observations noted when examining the first deep hst images was that many of the fainter galaxies were peculiar ( e.g. , driver et al . 1995 ; abraham et al . 1996",
    "; schade et al .",
    "these early studies were limited to examining galaxy number counts , as no redshifts were known for these faint galaxies .",
    "in addition to a faint blue excess , it was clear that there was also a peculiar excess , and often for the faintest galaxies .",
    "this is where the field remained until redshifts for a significant number of these peculiar galaxies were obtained .",
    "the field of high redshift studies changed dramatically in 1995 - 1997 with the advent of the both the hubble deep fields ( hdf ) ( williams et al .",
    "1996 ; ferguson et al . 2001 ) and the discovery of a significant population of high - redshift galaxies that could be discovered by the lyman - break technique ( steidel et al .",
    "1996 ; shapley 2011 ) now referred to as lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) .",
    "the hdf , and later significant campaigns to obtain very deep hubble imaging , such as the hubble deep field south ( williams et al .",
    "2000 ) , the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) ( giavalisco et al .",
    "2004 ) , the hubble ultra deep field ( udf ) ( beckwith et al .",
    "2006 ) , the cosmos field ( scoville et al .",
    "2007 ) , the extended groth strip survey ( egs ) ( davis et al . 2007 ) , and most recently the candels survey ( grogin et al . 2011 ; koekemoer et al . 2011 ) , have revolutionized the field of galaxy formation studies and in particular the study of morphologies .",
    "the critical nature of these deep fields is not simply that they are deeper than previous deep hst imaging , but that they are the fulcrum of large - scale efforts to obtain photometry at the faintest levels possible at nearly all wavelengths .",
    "this allowed redshifts to be measured for most galaxies using photometry through so - called photometric redshifts ( e.g. , dahlen et al .",

    "the availability of these redshifts allows us to measure evolution over broad redshift ranges which was not possible before as spectroscopic samples were few and far between , even with the use of relatively large multi - slit spectrographs such as lris on keck ( e.g. , cohen et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "early observations using a mixture of spectroscopic and photometric redshifts showed that the hubble sequence was certainly not in place at high redshifts @xmath6 ( van den bergh 1996 ) when examined using wfc2 data .",
    "this was verified in the rest - frame optical after deep near - infrared nicmos observations of the hdf were taken in 1998 ( dickinson 2000 ) .",
    "a deeper analysis of this showed that using the rest - frame optical structures of galaxies , the hubble sequence was nearly completely absent at @xmath87 , and only at @xmath90 did spirals and ellipticals become as common as peculiar galaxies ( conselice et al .",

    "it must be stressed that this figure only shows the visual estimates of galaxy morphology .",
    "the classification of a spiral , elliptical or peculiar does not imply that these galaxies have a certain star formation rate , color , mass or size .",
    "in fact what is often seen is that these visual morphologies do not correlate well with other physical properties ( e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "2011b ; mortlock et al .",

    "2013 ) .",
    "what figures  7 and 8 show is that at @xmath87 the dominant morphological type is peculiar , while disks and ellipticals become more common at lower redshifts ( see also conselice et al .",

    "2013 ) . figures  9 and 10 show images of the most massive galaxies at both @xmath92 and @xmath87 in the hubble ultra deep field , demonstrating the stark differences between the two .",
    "this review later examines in  4.3 what these peculiars are potentially evolving into at lower redshifts .",
    "there is however a general trend such that peculiar systems , and galaxies with internal features such as blobs , have a higher star formation rate than smoother galaxies ( e.g. , lee et al . 2013 ) .",
    "this shows that while the hubble sequence itself is not formed early in the history of the universe , there are trends which suggest it is becoming established .",
    "another interesting aspect to examine is not only the fraction of different galaxy types at various redshifts , but also their number density evolution as a function of galaxy type .",
    "we know from galaxy stellar mass measurements that the most massive systems are largely in place at @xmath89 at the same number density as at @xmath89 ( e.g. , bundy et al .",
    "2005 ; mortlock et al .",
    "it is the lower mass galaxies which typically increase the most in terms of the relative number density from the epoch @xmath93 . in the nearby universe",
    "most of the massive galaxies are ellipticals , thus this implies that most of the evolution in morphology will also be within the lower mass galaxies , which is what is found . in additional to a mass downsizing , we also find a morphological downsizing , such that morphological ellipticals are formed before the other galaxy types , most notably the spirals .",
    "however , whether these galaxies are inherently similar to the ellipticals and disks today is a separate question .",
    "one of the major questions in galaxy evolution we would like to address is when modern spirals and ellipticals form .",
    "this is related to the formation of the hubble sequence , but is a more detailed question , as what appears as an elliptical / spiral may be quite different from systems classified this way in the local universe .",
    "we thus are interested in determining when systems with the same morphology to galaxies we see in the local universe ( i.e. , disks and ellipticals ) achieve a similar physical state as measured through other properties . while morphological fractions are similar at @xmath94 as seen in the nearby universe , physical properties of galaxies with similar types - such as colors , star forming knots , and tidal features , have not reach the same level as locally .",
    "it is only recently at @xmath95 that the galaxy population appears in most ways similar to that of today .",
    "this question can also be further divided into many sub - questions , but for the purposes of this review i will examine the formation history of galaxies identifiable as disks and ellipticals in their gross morphology , as well as the formation of more detailed features such as spiral arms , bulges and bars .",
    "one major issue is the bar fraction of galaxies and how it has evolved with time .",
    "early studies found that the bar fraction evolves significantly ( abraham et al .",
    "1999 ) , while later studies find that bars were already in place up to @xmath89 ( elmegreen , elmegreen & hirst 2004 ; jogee et al .",
    "2004 ) . using the two degree area cosmos hst survey sheth et al .",
    "( 2008 ) find that the bar fraction increases from @xmath96 to @xmath97 , from 20% to @xmath98 60% of all disk galaxies .",
    "sheth et al . (",
    "2008 ) however find that the bar fraction is roughly constant with redshift for the most massive and red disk galaxies .",
    "in fact most of the observed evolution occurs for the lower mass bluer disk galaxies .",
    "the fraction of spiral galaxies with bars tells us when the disks in these galaxies become dynamically mature enough to form these structures .",
    "the fraction of bars also allows us to determine if bars have a role in the evolution of star formation , bulge formation , and the triggering of agn and the formation of supermassive black holes .",
    "the observational studies above all locate bars within disks either through changes in ellipticity and position angle in the surface brightness profiles of galaxies , or through visual inspection .",
    "it remains to be seen how the bar fraction holds when observed with a near - infrared band such as within the candels survey .",
    "a related issue is finding the onset of spiral structure , which has remained a problem for a variety of reasons , especially the difficulty of an unambiguous detection due to resolution / depth issues .",
    "several papers published with the advent of acs on hst showed that there are many examples of disk - like morphological systems at high redshifts .",
    "this includes the disks found by labbe et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the luminous diffuse objects of conselice et al . ( 2004 ) and later systems identified by elmegreen et al .",
    "( 2007 ) as clump - clusters .",
    "more recently , law et al . (",
    "2012 ) discovered a galaxy with a likely bona - fide spiral structure at @xmath99 , which also contained a large internal velocity dispersion based on ifu spectroscopy .",
    "spiral arms however appear very rare at high redshift , and likely only a small number are formed before @xmath89 .",
    "this is a major problem that needs more addressing and could be done with recently available data .",
    "however , there are many galaxies with clumpy features that are potentially spiral arms and disks in formation which we discuss in detail in  4.4 .    another feature of spirals and disks if the formation of bugles . while the traditional scenario is that bulges form in mergers (  4.3 ) , recent results suggest that bulges can form in multiple ways .",
    "psedo - bulges are different from classical bulges in that they are likely formed through secular processes within a disk .",
    "this can be seen in the different correlations between bulge properties and central massive black holes ( e.g. , kormendy & ho 2013 ) .    while morphology itself can often be ambiguous in terms of matching with contemporary hubble types , integral field unit ( ifu ) or long slit spectroscopy",
    "can remove some degeneracies .",
    "in particular the use of integral field spectroscopy on @xmath6 systems reveals important clues about the nature of these high redshift galaxies ( frster schreiber et al .",
    "2009 ; glazebrook et al .",
    "currently the most influential studies have been carried out with the sinfoni ifu on the vlt , as well as some work done with osiris on keck ( law et al .",
    "2012 ) .    these surveys ,",
    "most notably the sins collaboration ( e.g. , frster schreiber et al . 2009 ) find an equal distribution of different kinematic classes which are : rotationally dominated , mergers , and very compact galaxies with a high velocity dispersions ( e.g. , buitrago et al .",
    "2013b for massive galaxies ) .",
    "the true nature of these systems is not yet known , although in general it appears that galaxies at @xmath87 which are clumpy tend to have high velocity dispersions .",
    "this perhaps reveals the formation modes of disk galaxies at high redshift results in a high velocity dispersion .",
    "the future looks promising for combining larger surveys of ifu measurements of distant galaxies with resolved morphologies to decipher evolution .",
    "large surveys with for example kmos on vlt and mosfire on keck will revolutionize this area in the coming years .",
    "one of the most important findings in galaxy evolution studies in the past decade has been the discovery that distant galaxies are more compact than systems of the same mass in the local universe ( e.g. , daddi et al .",
    "2005 ; trujillo et al . 2007 ; buitrago et al . 2008 ; van dokkum et al . 2008 , 2010 ;",
    "weinzirl et al . 2011 ; baro et al .",
    "2013 ; williams et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "this change in sizes with time is now well characterized , and the evolution of galaxy sizes at a constant stellar mass selection of m@xmath100 can be characterized by a power law of the form @xmath101 .",
    "the value of the power - law slope changes with the galaxy surface brightness type , such that the disk - like galaxies with srsic indices @xmath102 evolve with @xmath103 , while spheroid - like galaxies with @xmath104 have @xmath105 ( figure  11 ) .",
    "this demonstrates that there is a faster evolution in measured sizes for spheroid - like galaxies , which therefore have a more effective increase in size over cosmic time than the disk - like objects .",
    "this size evolution is such that the effective radii of massive galaxies increases by up to a factor of five between @xmath106 and today at the same stellar mass ( e.g. , buitrago et al .",
    "2008 ; cassata et al .",
    "the form of this evolution has been investigated to determine whether or not the increase is due to the build up of the entire galaxy or just the inner or outer parts . the data to date show that galaxy growth through sizes is occurring in its outer parts , with the central parts in place at early times ( e.g. , carrasco et al . 2010 ; van dokkum et al . 2010 ) .",
    "this indicates that the build up of massive galaxies is an inside out process , whereby the inner parts of massive galaxies are in place before the outer parts with the same stellar mass density as today ( e.g. , hopkins et al .",
    "2009 ) .    an alternative way to investigate this problem is to examine the number of compact and ultra - compact galaxies at various redshifts .",
    "there is some controversy over whether or not there exist in the local universe compact galaxies with sizes similar to those seen at high redshifts .",
    "however , what is clear is that the number densities of these ultra - compact galaxies declines in relative abundance very steeply at @xmath107 ( cassata et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "the processes responsible for this increase in sizes at lower redshifts is not well understood , and is currently a source of much debate .",
    "the most popular explanation is that this size increase is produced through minor mergers ( e.g. , bluck et al .",
    "2012 ; mclure et al .",
    "2013 ) , although other ideas such as agn performing work on gas is another idea ( e.g. , bluck et al .",
    "2011 ) . however , the outer parts of nearby massive galaxies are too old to have been formed in relatively recent star formation , and the star formation observed at high redshift is not sufficient to produce the observed increase in sizes ( ownsworth et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "the major idea for the physical mechanism producing galaxy size evolution is through dry minor mergers , as major mergers are not able to produce the observation of increasing size without significantly increasing mass ( e.g. , khochfar & silk 2006 ; naab et al .",
    "2009 ; bluck et al . 2012",
    "; oser et al . 2012 ; shankar et al .",
    "there is currently some controversy over whether or not the observed minor merger rate is high enough to provide this increase in sizes , with the most massive galaxies with m@xmath100 appearing to have enough minor mergers ( e.g. , kaviraj et al .",
    "2009 ) to produce this size evolution ( bluck et al . 2012 ) , but this may not be the case for lower mass systems ( e.g. , newman et al . 2012 ) .",
    "it does appear however that minor mergers are a significant mechanism for producing low levels of star formation in early - types at @xmath108 , as well as for adding significant amount of stellar mass to these galaxies ( kaviraj et al .",
    "2009 , 2011 ) .",
    "one of the major issues is determining not only the number of minor dry mergers , but also the time - scale for these mergers (  3.4 ) which more simulations would help understand .    along with the evolution of galaxy sizes , there is also a significant evolution in the underlying structures of galaxies at higher redshifts .",
    "one of the cleanest ways to see this is through the evolution of the srsic parameter , @xmath13 ( figure  7 ) . when examining the evolution of derived values of @xmath13 as a function of redshift for both a stellar mass and at a constant number density selection , it is apparent that galaxies have lower @xmath13 values at higher redshifts for the same selection ( e.g. , buitrago et al .",
    "this has been interpreted by some to imply that these galaxies are more disk - like at high redshifts ( bruce et al .",
    "2012 ) , although the morphologies of these systems by visual inspection , and their internal structures and colors , are not similar to modern disks ( e.g. , conselice et al . 2011 ; mortlock et al .",
    "it appears that these disk - like galaxies , while having light profiles similar to modern disks , are much smaller , have a higher stellar mass , and are often undergoing intense star formation with peculiar morphologies , making them un - disk - like in all other regards .",
    "they indeed are likely a type of galaxy with no local counterpart .",
    "one of the primary , if not the primary use of galaxy structure at high redshift at the time of writing , is using it to measure the merger history of galaxies .",
    "this is a major issue in extragalactic astronomy , as merging is not only a method for galaxies to form , but is also a potential way in which black holes , star formation and other internal features of galaxies are assembled .",
    "merging is also one of the key predictions of the cold dark matter model which is the dominant idea for how galaxy evolution occurs through cosmic time ( e.g. , white & rees 1978 ; blumenthal et al .",
    "1984 ; cole et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the merger history of galaxies was first measured through galaxies in pairs - systems of at least two galaxies near enough to each other to merge in a reasonable amount of time ( typically 20 or 30 kpc ) , and in the case of kinematic pairs with a low velocity difference of around 200 ( e.g. , patton et al .",
    "1997 , 2002 ; le fvre et al . 2000 ; lopez - sanjuan et al .",
    "2011 , 2012 ) .",
    "simulation results show that most pairs of galaxies selected in this way will eventually merge , and within a time - scale comparable to dynamical friction ( e.g. , moreno et al 2013 ) .",
    "using pairs to find galaxies which are merging is still a large industry , and interested readers are referred to the latest papers in this field ( e.g. , lopez - sanjuan et al .",
    "2011 , 2012 ; tasca et al .",
    "pairs of galaxies also provide a check on the methodology we use to find major mergers , as it is an independent measure of this formation mode .",
    "however the merger fraction measured through pairs is more statistical in nature than structure , and does not reveal for certain whether a galaxy is a merger or not .",
    "a detailed cas structural study of starburst , ulirgs , and other merging galaxies shows that another route for measuring the merger history is through the use of the asymmetry index , whereby the most asymmetric galaxies are ones involved in mergers ( conselice 1997 ; conselice et al .",
    "2000a , b ; conselice 2003 ;  3.2 ) .",
    "the merger history is also measured through other parameters , whereby mergers occupy a unique parameter space ( e.g. , lotz et al . 2004 ; 2008 ; freeman et al .",
    "2013 ) .    while there is no perfect 1:1 relation between parameter space definitions of mergers with all mergers identifiable by eye",
    ", we still find that about half of all identifiable mergers fall within specific regions of parameter space , and that there is a low contamination from other galaxy types (  3.2 ) .",
    "thus , galaxy merger fractions are an observation which has to be interpreted carefully with the use of galaxy merger models .",
    "the merger fraction history is the basic observable which reveals how mergers are changing and evolving through cosmic time .",
    "it is measured at high redshift through the criteria described in  3.2 , and the resulting merger fractions are shown in figure  12 ( e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "2008 , 2009 ; bluck et al .",
    "this figure shows that the inferred merger fraction increases with redshift .",
    "this increase is typically fit as a power - law of the form :    @xmath109    where @xmath110 is the merger fraction at @xmath58 and @xmath111 is the power - law index for measuring mergers . in general , the higher the value of @xmath111 the more steeply the merger history increases at higher redshifts .",
    "an alternative parameterization of the merger history is given by a combined power - law exponential ( e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "2008 ) whose form is :    @xmath112.\\ ] ]    the local @xmath113 merger fraction in this formalism is given by @xmath114 , and the merger peak is located at @xmath115 .",
    "this form of the merger fraction evolution appears to fit lower mass galaxy merger fractions better than a single power - law up to @xmath5 , as this allows for a peak at a value of the mergers and a decline at higher redshifts .",
    "in fact , only the highest mass galaxies with m@xmath91 appear to increase up to @xmath5 , while lower mass galaxies have a merger peak around @xmath116 , and declining at higher redshifts ( e.g. , conselice et al . 2008 ) .    while it initially appeared that there were significant differences in merger histories between different studies ( e.g. , lin et al .",
    "2004 ) it is now clear that these are due to several effects .",
    "the first is that the value of the power - law index @xmath111 can vary significantly just due to the value of the anchor redshift at @xmath58 .",
    "secondly , when comparisons are done between galaxies selected in the same way ( stellar mass or absolute magnitude ) , and correct time - scales are used for different techniques (  3.4 ) then merger rates agree within the uncertainties ( e.g. , conselice et al . 2009 ; lotz et al .",

    "2007 ) .",
    "early results using small samples of few dozen galaxies at @xmath89 , abraham et al .",
    "( 1999 ) demonstrated that many morphologically selected ellipticals in their sample show a diversity in their star formation histories , with recent bursts of star formation commonly seen .",
    "abraham et al . ( 1999 ) also showed that bulges in these systems almost always have ages older than their disks .",
    "this was followed up with a study of 79 field spheroids by menanteau et al .",
    "( 2001 ) who find that a third of their morphologically regular systems have recent star formation in their centers , with so - called blue cores. it is possible that some of these systems are forming the pseudo - bulges that we see in the nearby universe .",
    "there are other studies of the bulges of distant galaxies , including hathi et al .",
    "( 2009 ) who find that bulges at @xmath158 have ages of a 1 - 2 gyr , with stellar masses up to 10@xmath159 in the hubble ultra deep field .",
    "they also find that late type bulges are younger than early types , a finding which also exists in the local universe .",
    "however , classical bulges up to @xmath89 with de vaucouleur profiles are found to have old stellar populations similar to giant ellipticals at the same epoch ( koo et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "another potentially powerful approach towards understanding the formation history of galaxies is to examine their light distribution on a pixel by pixel basis .",
    "the idea here is that each pixel or resolution element is independent of others and each has their own sed which can be fit by stellar population analysis methods ( e.g. , bothun 1986 ; abraham et al .",
    "1999 ; lanyon - foster et al .",
    "local galaxies have different pixel color magnitude diagrams , depending on morphological type , with early types having a much narrow locus of points than disk galaxies .",
    "galaxies also often look more symmetrical in stellar mass maps than in light ( lanyon - foster et al .",
    "2012 ; wuyts et al .",
    "2012 figure  14 ) .",
    "star forming galaxies in the candels survey were recently studied in a pixel by pixel approach in wuyts et al .",
    "( 2012 ) who examined 323 systems at @xmath160 and a further 326 higher redshift systems at @xmath161 .",
    "this study uses the optical acs and near infrared wfc3 filters to construct seds for all pixels in these galaxies .",
    "wuyts et al .",
    "( 2012 ) find that the nuclei of star forming galaxies are redder and have older ages than their outer parts .",
    "clumps in these galaxies also generally occupy a smaller fraction of the total mass than the total light , demonstrating that the large clumps seen in distant star forming galaxies are mostly star forming regions .",
    "clumps are also found to be central , off - central , or outer , and these clumps may play a role in forming the bulges of these galaxies through a secular process ( bournaud et al . 2007 ; elmegreen et al .",
    "2008 ; genzel et al .",
    "2008 ) (  5 ) .",
    "this shows that there are methods beyond hierarchical clustering for the formation of structures within galaxies .",
    "one of the major ideas behind how mergers drive galaxy formation is that when galaxies merge , gas clouds collide , triggering star formation . at the same time gas",
    "is driven to the centers of galaxies , producing active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ( e.g. , hopkins et al .",
    "observationally we also know that galaxies which are concentrated , with for example a high srsic profile , are more likely to be quenched ( e.g. , bell et al .",
    "2012 ; fan et al .",
    "there is therefore a strong theoretical reason to expect that structure , as influenced by mergers , should correlate with galaxy formation .",
    "there is also strong evidence that the star formation in galaxies is regulated by structure .",
    "how these relate however is not yet clear .",
    "observational it has proven thus far difficult to correlate the presence of mergers , through either pairs or the presence of a distorted or peculiar structures , with the presence of agn or a star formation excess at high redshift .",
    "recent studies such as cotini et al .",
    "( 2013 ) use cas indices to show that the fraction of nearby galaxies with agn are roughly five times more likely than a control sample to have a distorted structure .",
    "however , studies at higher redshifts generally do not find that more asymmetric or merging galaxies have a higher agn fraction ( e.g. , grogin et al .",
    "2005 ; gabor et al .",
    "2009 ; kocevski et al .",
    "this is also found in the deepest acs hubble imaging , although it does appear that agn are found in more concentrated galaxies at higher redshifts ( grogin et al .",
    "there is also a lack of a higher fraction of peculiar / merging galaxies found in the gems / stages hst survey by bohm et al .",
    "( 2013 ) for agn with luminosities of l@xmath162 erg s@xmath157 .",
    "this may be an indication that type-1 agn are more likely to be found in early - type massive systems .",
    "it remains to be seen if obscured agn , the type-2s , are found in more merging systems and thereby represent an earlier phase of the merger .",
    "another major issue in which morphology and structure play an important role is understanding the origin of dusty star forming galaxies , the so - called ulirgs or sub - mm galaxies .",
    "sub - mm galaxies are those which appear very bright at sub - mm wavelengths , typically at 850 @xmath65 m , and are at high - redshift at @xmath6 .",
    "morphological analyses of these sub - mm galaxies showed early on that they are involved in merger activity , and have peculiar morphologies ( e.g. , chapman et al .",
    "2003 ; conselice et al .",
    "many of these galaxies have structures and morphologies consist with being involved in mergers ( e.g. , ricciardelli et al .",
    "kartaltepe et al .",
    "( 2012 ) find that a sample of ulirgs selected from the candels fields are more likely than a field galaxy sample to be involved in galaxy interactions and mergers ( 72@xmath163% vs. 32@xmath164% ) .",
    "however , swinbank et al .",
    "( 2010 ) argue using a large sample of sub - mm galaxies that their morphologies are not significantly different from other star forming field galaxies at similar redshifts .",
    "swinbank et al .",
    "( 2010 ) also find that their sub - mm galaxies have light profiles more similar to early - types than disks .",
    "although , targett et al . ( 2011 ) find that sub - mm galaxies have disk - like profiles , and conclude that these systems are more like forming disks than spheroids forming in mergers .",
    "this suggests that the morphology of sub - mm galaxies is still open for debate with results that appear to be conflicting .",
    "more detailed work , likely with adaptive optics in the k - band to avoid issues with dust and morphological k - corrections , are needed to make further progress .",
    "furthermore , as mentioned earlier there is a strong observed correlation between galaxies which have steep surface brightness profiles , with @xmath104 , and the quenching of star formation ( e.g. , bell 2012 ) .",
    "this shows that galaxy structure either produces a change in the galaxy history , or more likely is a symptom of the effects which produces this quenching . in general",
    ", there are a few ways to quench the star formation seen in galaxies at high redshift .",
    "some of these are environmental , such as ram - pressure stripping and strangulation ( e.g. , peng et al . 2010 )",
    ". however , these processes will be ineffective for the bulk of field galaxies which we study in this review .",
    "what is more likely driving the quenching of typical field galaxies is merger driven , or driven by the stellar / halo mass in some form of feedback process ( e.g. , peng et al .",
    "2010 ; peng et al . 2012 ; lilly et al .",
    "2013 ; carollo et al .",
    "the most likely candidates are mergers that either heats gas or removes most of it in giant starbursts , preventing further star formation .",
    "the other idea for this feedback is that it is the result of agn .",
    "the idea here is that the ongoing star formation is truncated by the existing gas in a galaxy being heated or removed by an active agn ( e.g. , croton et al .",
    "it is therefore likely that a few critical processes are ongoing to produce the hubble sequence , and specifically the red , passive and concentrated high mass systems .      by far the bulk of what we know of galaxy structural evolution is at @xmath86 .",
    "the reason for this is simply because this is the limit where we can observe the rest - frame optical using observations in the near - infrared from the hubble space telescope , which is only effective at imaging at filters bluer than the h - band ( often h@xmath166 with wfc3 and nicmos ) .",
    "however , there are some observations of galaxy structure at even higher redshifts that provides some information about the formation of these galaxies . to date",
    "most of these observations are done in a red filter using the acs camera on hubble , either the i@xmath167 or z@xmath168 band .",
    "it must be remembered that these systems are being observed in the rest - frame ultraviolet , and thus their morphologies will be dominated by young stars .",
    "there have only been a few major studies that focus on the structures of these ultra - high redshift galaxies .",
    "ferguson et al . ( 2004 ) study the sizes and the axis ratios of lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) galaxies up to @xmath0 in the goods fields , finding that galaxies are smaller and more disk - like in their axis ratios at higher redshifts .",
    "this was also shown in an extensive study of 4700 lbgs by ravindranath et al .",
    "( 2006 ) who find that 40% have exponential light profiles , 30% have de vaucouleurs profiles , and the remaining 30% have multiple cores .",
    "the ellipticity distribution of these lbgs shows that these systems are skewed towards high values with @xmath169 , which can not be explained by viewing disks and spheroids at various angles ( ravindranath et al .",
    "this is either an indication that these systems are mergers , or that star formation is distributed in the outer parts of these galaxies creating these elliptical structures .    for ultra - high redshift galaxies , conselice & arnold ( 2009 )",
    "examine the visual morphologies and pair fractions of lyman - break galaxies in the hubble ultra deep field acs filters from @xmath170 .",
    "these acs data on the udf still provide the highest resolution and deepest imaging of the most distant galaxies .",
    "conselice & arnold ( 2009 ) find that the fraction of @xmath165 lyman - break galaxies which are peculiar in appearance is roughly constant at @xmath171% throughout this redshift range .",
    "conselice & arnold furthermore demonstrate that many of the lbgs at these redshifts have tidal like features ",
    "fans , shells , etc . that resemble merger signatures seen at lower redshifts .",
    "the derived merger fraction from lbg pairs also agrees with the merger fraction based on cas and visual estimates ( conselice & arnold 2009 ; cooke et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "it is perhaps surprisingly easier to identify galaxies in pairs at these redshifts than at lower redshifts , as one can use the drop - out band to remove contamination , and thus ensure that two galaxies close by in the sky are at least at a similar redshift .",
    "this results in a smaller correction needed to calculate merger fractions , and thus the merger fraction in principle can be measured more accurately ( conselice & arnold 2009 ) .",
    "jiang et al . ( 2013 ) similarly examine the rest - frame uv morphologies of 51 lyman@xmath172 galaxies and 16 lyman - break galaxies and find a merger fraction for the brightest galaxies of around 50% , and otherwise a diversity in morphology .",
    "most recently , using wfc3 data from the udf oesch et al .",
    "( 2010 ) show that @xmath173 galaxies are very compact with a typical size of 0.7@xmath174 kpc with little size evolution down to @xmath0 .",
    "there is more development down to @xmath175 with the observation of more extensive wings of light at these lower redshifts , and a corresponding increase in sizes ( e.g. , ferguson et al .",
    "2004 ) following a similar power - law with redshift , as is found for size evolution between @xmath5 and @xmath76 ( buitrago et al . 2008 ; mosleh et al 2012 ) .",
    "galaxy morphology is well known to correlate strongly in the local universe with environment ( e.g. , dressler 1984 ; postman et al . 2005 ) .",
    "it is also clear that there is a strong relationship between morphology and stellar mass , such that the most massive galaxies tend to have elliptical morphologies and lack star formation .",
    "combining this with the morphology - redshift relation shows that the structure of a galaxy depends upon its mass , local environment , as well as time . which of these is the leading cause for producing galaxy evolution is an active area of study .",
    "the problem of galaxy morphology as a function of density is a large area of research and is outside the immediate scope of this article .",
    "however , it is relevant to discuss some of the major findings , and how they relate to the evolution of galaxy structure with time .",
    "the major effect of morphology is that the type of galaxy , either elliptical or spiral , depends to a large degree in the nearby universe on the local density of that particular galaxy s environment .",
    "this relation is such that the higher the density of the local environment , the more likely a galaxy will be early - type and non - star forming ( e.g. , dressler 1984 ; gomez et al .",
    "2003 ; blanton & moustakas 2009 ) .",
    "disk properties are also highly environmentally driven , with few classical bulge or elliptical systems in low density environments ( kormendy et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "it is also the case that more massive galaxies are more likely to be early type .",
    "the question is which relationship is more fundamental , and relates to the old issue of  nature vs. nurture  for galaxy formation .",
    "the structures and morphologies of galaxies can help address this problem , especially by examining the limited number of observations we have of galaxy structure in high redshift overdensities , or ( proto-)clusters .",
    "observations of overdensities at high redshifts are just starting in earnest , but already provide some clues to this .",
    "very massive clusters at high redshifts , up to @xmath133 , contain a similar pattern of morphologies and densities as local galaxies , such that the denser areas contain a higher fraction of systems which are elliptical .",
    "this tends to break down for the limited number of cluster candidates found at higher redshifts , where the galaxy population is irregular and peculiar , as is found for the general high redshift galaxy population ( e.g. , papovich et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "detailed studies are however possible up to @xmath89 both by using field galaxies of various local environments , as well as looking at the morphological and structural distributions of galaxies within rich clusters at various redshifts . for field galaxies ,",
    "tasca et al . (",
    "2009 ) examine the morphology - density relationship for 100,000 galaxies in the cosmos survey .",
    "they find that the morphology - density relation changes slightly with redshift , becoming flatter at higher - z ( e.g. , grtzbauch et al .",
    "2011a , b ) . above a stellar mass of about 10@xmath176",
    "the morphologies of galaxies appear to become more dominated by the stellar mass as the critical factor rather than density ( e.g. , grtzbauch et al",
    ". 2011a ) .",
    "the situation in rich clusters at @xmath89 , and the formation of s0s , is such that the trend with environment is not as steep as is found at @xmath76 .",
    "this suggests that s0s are not entirely formed yet in these distant clusters , however the elliptical population does seem to be in place compared with the population at @xmath76 .",
    "another structural feature that can be investigated is the size evolution and how it varies with environment .",
    "the limited number of investigations of this have found that galaxies at @xmath6 in higher density environments show signs of a more rapid increase of galaxy size with redshift in comparison to the field ( e.g. , cooper et al . 2012 ; lani et al .",
    "this is one indication whereby a dense environment can facilitate a more rapid evolution in galaxies , although it is a slight effect that needs further confirmation .",
    "galaxy morphology and structure allows a new way to compare with cosmologically based galaxy formation models , as well as those which include extensive physics such as star formation , agn feedback and supernova in more detailed hydrodynamical models .",
    "this review only briefly discusses this large topic and how it relates to galaxy structure . for a more detailed recent review on the theory of galaxy formation from a theoretical prospective see silk & mamon ( 2012 ) .",
    "galaxy formation models were first developed to explain the structures of galaxies , namely the bulge / disk / halo trichotomy , and the ages of the stars in these components ( eggen et al .",
    "the default initial assumption in the first galaxy formation models was that galaxies formed like stars in a relatively rapid collapse .",
    "in the 1980s the first computer simulations of structure formation showed that a universe dominated by cold dark matter ( cdm ) matched observations of galaxy clustering on large scales ( davis et al .",
    "1985 ) , and that within this framework galaxy assembly should be hierarchical ( blumenthal et al . 1984 ) , yet this is a fundamental prediction which is just now starting to be tested with only a few papers comparing the observations to the theoretical predictions ( e.g. , bertone & conselice 2009 ; jogee et al .",
    "2009 ; hopkins et al . 2010 ; lotz et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "the situation today is that there are many simulations that are used to predict properties of the galaxy population , and how it evolves through time .",
    "these models are largely successful when predicting basic properties of nearby galaxies , such as their luminosities , masses , colors and star formation rates , as well as scaling relationships of galaxies .",
    "however problems still exist in predicting the abundances of low and high mass galaxies ( e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "2007 ; guo et al .",
    "2011 ) . within galaxy formation models",
    "there are very famous problems such as the satellite and the cdm dark matter profile , but there are also significant issues when examining how the evolution of galaxies occurs , and trying to match this with the theory .",
    "another major problem is that there are several large disk galaxies without significant bulges in the nearby universe that are not predicted in cdm ( e.g. , kormendy et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "one of the ways to further test these models is to investigate how well cdm models can reproduce the formation history of galaxies as seen through the merging process using the so - called semi - analytical method ( e.g. , bower et al . 2006 ; guo et al .",
    "we show this comparison with the measured merger fractions in figure  12 at two different stellar mass ranges of m@xmath91 and m@xmath100 .",
    "plotted as the thin solid black line towards the lower part of each diagram is the prediction for the major merger fraction for galaxies from the millennium simulation ( bertone & conselice 2009 ) .",
    "also shown on these figures as the dotted blue line is the same predictions for major mergers for warm dark matter models ( e.g. , menci et al .",
    "2012 ) , which do a better job than cdm in matching the observed data .",
    "however , cdm better matches if minor mergers are taken into account , although the comparison merger fraction is only for major mergers based on the methodology used ( conselice 2003a ; lotz et al .",
    "2010a ) .",
    "other recent attempts to predict the merger history of observed galaxies include the abundance matching technique ( e.g. , stewart et al .",
    "2008 ) where observed galaxies are matched to halos in models through their comparative abundance levels .",
    "hopkins et al .",
    "( 2010 ) predict based on this abundance matching the merger rate and fraction for galaxies .",
    "the result of this is show in figure  12 for galaxies between m@xmath177 . while the merger fractions from hopkins et al .",
    "( 2010 ) are higher than those from the cdm models , they are still lower than the observations ( see also jogee et al .",
    "2009 and lotz et al .",
    "2011 for further discussions ) .",
    "similar results from stewart et al .",
    "( 2008 ) are also shown in figure  12 , who find results similar to hopkins et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .    finally , as a contract to these maller et al .",
    "( 2006 ) present cosmological hydrodynamical simulation results for similar mass galaxies of a few times 10@xmath159 , and find the highest merger fraction predictions of any simulation result ( figure  12 ) .",
    "this shows that the predictions for merger histories are not correct or consistent with each other , and that more simulation work should be focused on this critical aspect of the galaxy population .",
    "this is an area where future work is certainly needed .",
    "there are several other types of simulations in which galaxy structure and morphology can be directly compared with observations of galaxies through cosmic time .",
    "perhaps the most direct of these is to compare the properties and structural features of distant galaxies to hydrodynamical models of galaxy formation .",
    "some of this work for galaxy mergers is discussed in  3.4 .",
    "early work in this area showed that the components of galaxies - namely bulges and disks were the result of accretion events ( e.g. , steinmetz & navarro 2002 ) and argued from their simulations that the hubble type of a galaxy is not stable for long periods of cosmic time .",
    "governato et al .",
    "( 2007 ) show that disk galaxies can be simulated which have properties that match the morphological properties and kinematics of nearby disks , although this simulation is not in a cosmological context .",
    "overall however it is very difficult to predict the formation of galaxy morphology in simulations , and in a real sense this will be the ultimate test of galaxy formation models in the future .    also , as discussed in  4.6 one of the most commonly seen properties in high redshift star forming galaxies is that they often contain large clumps of star formation within their disks .",
    "a major question is how these clumps form , evolve , and how they may play a role in the formation of other galaxy components such as bulges and agn .",
    "bournaud et al .",
    "( 2013 ) examined this problem computationally to determine how clumps with stellar masses of m@xmath178 evolve in gaseous disks .",
    "the major question is whether these clumps dissipate within 50 myr or so , the dynamical time - scale of the clumps , or if they regenerate and survive .",
    "bournaud et al .",
    "( 2013 ) find that these clumps can last around 300 myr through acquiring new gas from its disk , although some mass is lost through tidal effects .",
    "this is enough time to migrate towards the center of the galaxy which can fuel the agn or merge to form a bulge .",
    "this shows that these clumps may provide a significant route for galaxies to form .",
    "thus , we have evidence for both inside - out and outside - in formation occurring in the galaxy population . what remains to be seen",
    "is whether one of these mechanisms is dominant , and the relative role of both in forming galaxies .",
    "i present here a review of galaxy structure and morphology studies in the galaxy population through cosmic time from @xmath11 until today .",
    "the approach taken in this review is largely observational with a limited amount of interpretation , although i do show where galaxy structure and morphology can test galaxy formation and even cosmological models in a new , largely unexplored way .    as of january 2014",
    ", the major conclusions concerning galaxy structure and its evolution , as discussed in this article , can be summarized as :    i. galaxy structure and morphology is the longest studied observational feature of galaxies . in this review galaxy morphology",
    "is the apparent classification based on visual inspection , while structure is a way to quantify the light distributions in galaxies . in many ways morphology",
    "is still a descriptive science , and visual efforts continue to provide useful information in the form of large - scale projects to classify many galaxies , as in the galaxy zoo effort .",
    "the hubble sequence has and likely will remain the major paradigm in which we consider galaxy morphology , although this system does not work at high redshifts where most galaxies can not be classified into a single hubble type (  4.1 ) .",
    "\\ii . using the hubble scheme the evolution of three broad classes of galaxies",
    "are now classified accurately out to @xmath5  namely ellipticals , spirals and peculiars .",
    "the relative abundance of these galaxies has been measured as a function of redshift out to these early times .",
    "what we find is that the peculiar galaxies dominate the galaxy population at @xmath179 , with a relative fraction of at least 70% .",
    "galaxies which are elliptical and spiral like in appearance ( but not necessarily in physical properties , see  4.1 ) become progressively more common at lower redshifts .",
    "the number densities of these two normal galaxies together equals that of the peculiars by @xmath180 ( mortlock et al .",
    "2013 ) .    \\iii .",
    "since galaxy morphology by visual estimates is limited in its ability to derive the physics behind galaxy formation and by its nature is not quantitative , the use of parametric (  2.2 ) and non - parametric (  2.3 ) methods are essential for deriving in a quantitative way how galaxies are evolving .",
    "these quantitative indices also correlate to some degree with the present and past star formation history and properties of a galaxy .",
    "more work is needed to establish these relations with more certainty , but it appears that the srsic index and concentration correlate with the scale or mass of a galaxy , the clumpiness index with the star formation , and the asymmetry parameter with ongoing merging activity (  3 ) .",
    "the merger history is now know from applying structural analyses to galaxy images in deep hubble space telescope surveys such as the hubble deep field (  4 ) .",
    "the result of this is that the galaxy merger fraction increases with redshift at all stellar mass and luminosity selections .",
    "this increase can be fit well by a power - law @xmath181 up to @xmath5 , although at higher redshifts the structurally derived merger fraction may plateau ( conselice & arnold 2009 ) . using numerical / hydrodynamical simulations",
    "the time - scales for these mergers can be calculated , and thus merger fractions can be converted into merger rates (  4.3.2 ) .",
    "the merger rate allows for the calculation of the number of mergers galaxies at various masses undergo , as well as the amount of stellar mass which is added to galaxies due to the merger process . the result of this is that it appears that up to half of the stellar mass in modern massive galaxies were formed in mergers between @xmath7 , although at @xmath92 dry mergers are likely more responsible for the further formation of these galaxies .",
    "v. the resolved structures of galaxies also allows us to measure the internal features of galaxies and how they are assembling .",
    "there is some controversy over the formation history bulges , disks and bars , although many of these are likely formed by secular processes produced internally by disk dynamical evolution .",
    "this is an area where significant progress could be made in the next few years .",
    "the most up to date results suggest that the bar fraction for spiral galaxies at @xmath92 depends upon the stellar mass of the galaxy .",
    "the most massive galaxies have a similar bar fraction at @xmath108 as they do today , yet lower mass and bluer disk galaxies have a significantly lower bar fraction than similarly low mass nearby disks .",
    "this mirrors the evolution of the hubble sequence itself where more massive galaxies settle into normal ellipticals and disks before lower mass galaxies .",
    "spiral structure is a difficult problem and while some examples exist at high redshift , even at @xmath87 , the general onset of when disks form spirals is almost totally unconstrained by observations .",
    "resolved imaging also permits us to measure the spectral energy distributions and colors , of galaxy components and individual pixels of different galaxies .",
    "this is another area where more work needs to be performed , but it appears that bulges of spirals tend to be older than their disks at high redshift , but there are examples of many ellipticals which have blue cores and central star formation (  4.1.1 ) .",
    "pixel - pixel analyses show that galaxies have a mixed star formation history , and that the inner parts of galaxies are often older than their outer parts .",
    "pixel studies also show that the clumps seen in distant star forming galaxies are composed of young stellar populations , and thus must have recently formed or regenerate themselves .",
    "perhaps the most popular ( at present ) problem in galaxy structural evolution is the apparent compactness in size of galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "the observations show that massive galaxies at @xmath6 have sizes which are a factor of 2 - 5 smaller than similar massive galaxies in today s universe .",
    "this result has been studied in many different ways , and the sizes of a stellar mass selected sample of galaxies increases gradually as a function of redshift with a power - law increase @xmath182 , where @xmath183 varies from @xmath184 to @xmath185 depending upon whether the selected samples are disk - like or elliptical - like (  4.2 ) .",
    "results to date suggest that these galaxies are building up their outer parts over time to become larger systems , rather than adding mass to their centers .",
    "this process is unlikely driven by star formation , and theory suggests that this formation is produced by minor merger events (  4.2 ) .    in summary , we have learned much about galaxy morphology and structure over the past 15 years .",
    "there are however many open questions still remaining on all aspects of using structure to determine evolution .",
    "more work needs to be done in tying galaxy structure to underlying physics , both through empirical work and in simulations .",
    "furthermore , the time - scales for structural features such as mergers and large clump survival are critical to better understand .",
    "broad morphological features will remain important over the next decades as telescopes such as jwst , euclid , lsst , the dark energy survey , amongst others , will all resolve many more galaxies than we can currently study , and at higher redshifts .",
    "this opens up entirely new possibilities , and the with careful thoughtful planning a new revolution in galaxy structure may be upon us soon .",
    "a review such as this is written with help from many people .",
    "in particular i thank alice mortlock , asa bluck , fernando buitrago , jamie ownsworth , and ken duncan for illuminating conversations and collaboration on these topics over the past few years .",
    "i also thank jennifer lotz , fernando buitrago , stijn wuyts , alice mortlock for kindly providing figures .",
    "i personally thank the stfc and the leverhulme trust in the uk , as well as the nsf and nasa in the usa for financial support .",

    "<S> i present a comprehensive review of the evolution of galaxy structure in the universe from the first galaxies we can currently observe at @xmath0 down to galaxies we see in the local universe . </S>",
    "<S> i further address how these changes reveal galaxy formation processes that only galaxy structural analyses can provide . </S>",
    "<S> this review is pedagogical and begins with a detailed discussion of the major methods in which galaxies are studied morphologically and structurally . </S>",
    "<S> this includes the well - established visual method for morphology ; srsic fitting to measure galaxy sizes and surface brightness profile shapes ; non - parametric structural methods including the concentration ( @xmath1 ) , asymmetry ( @xmath2 ) , clumpiness ( @xmath3 ) ( cas ) method , the gini / m@xmath4 parameters , as well as newer structural indices . </S>",
    "<S> included is a discussion of how these structural indices measure fundamental properties of galaxies such as their scale , star formation rate , and ongoing merger activity . </S>",
    "<S> extensive observational results are shown demonstrating how broad galaxy morphologies and structures change with time up to @xmath5 , from small , compact and peculiar systems in the distant universe to the formation of the hubble sequence dominated by spirals and ellipticals we find today . </S>",
    "<S> this review further addresses how structural methods accurately identify galaxies in mergers , and allow measurements of the merger history out to @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the properties and evolution of internal structures of galaxies are depicted , such as bulges , disks , bars , and at @xmath6 large star forming clumps . </S>",
    "<S> the structure and morphologies of host galaxies of active galactic nuclei and starbursts / sub - mm galaxies are described , along with how morphological galaxy quenching occurs . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the role of environment in producing structure in galaxies over cosmic time is treated . alongside the evolution of general structure , </S>",
    "<S> i also delineate how galaxy sizes change with time , with measured sizes up to a factor of 2 - 5 smaller at high redshift at a given stellar mass . </S>",
    "<S> this review concludes with a discussion of how the evolving trends in sizes , structures , and morphologies reveal the formation mechanisms behind galaxies which provides a new and unique way to test theories of galaxy formation .    </S>",
