    "the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) , relic emission of the formation and evolution of the galaxies , peaks in the far - infrared ( fir ) in the 60 - 200  @xmath0 m wavelength range @xcite . in the local universe",
    "only about a third of the extragalactic emission is released in the fir @xcite .",
    "however , the cib fir peak accounts for more than half of the total optical / infrared background , indicating strong evolution of galaxy properties toward high fir output in the past . characterizing the galaxies responsible for most of the cib is therefore an important goal of cosmological surveys . galaxy counts ( or number counts ) provide a powerful tool to investigate the evolution of the galaxies and their contribution to the cib .    the cryogenic infrared space missions _ iras _ ( infrared astronomical satellite ) and _ iso _ ( infrared space observatory ) (",

    "* for reviews ) provided important data on source counts at 60  @xmath0 m @xcite and at 100  @xmath0 m @xcite , and more recently at 90  @xmath0 m @xcite and 170  @xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "mid - infrared ( mir ) observation with isocam at 15@xmath0 m @xcite are also of great interest since they are believed to resolve a significant fraction of the cib into sources @xcite .",
    "the _ spitzer space telescope _ @xcite provides the ability for much deeper and wider - area surveys from 3.6 to 160  @xmath0 m .",

    "spitzer_. a companion paper addresses the mir source counts at 24  @xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "the three - band source counts are the basis of new phenomenological models by @xcite .",
    "observations were carried out with the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ @xcite in the _ chandra _ deep field south ( cdfs ) and the botes field corresponding to the noao deep wide field survey ndwfs @xcite ; we also used an engineering mips observation of the marano field . the observational mode ( scan map )",
    "provides multiple sightings of each source , typically 10 and 60 at 70@xmath0 m in the botes and cdfs , respectively .",
    "however , at 160  @xmath0 m , the number of sightings is only typically 2 in botes and 12 in cdfs .",
    "see table  [ fields ] and @xcite for details .",
    "the data were reduced with the data analysis tool @xcite , from the raw data ( ramps ) to the final coadded mosaics .",
    "the illumination corrections were derived from the data themselves . at 70  @xmath0 m ,",
    "the data have been median - filtered in the time domain before mosaicking .",
    "note that data from ge : ga detectors are always challenging to process ; but with mips , most of the difficulties are overcome with frequent calibrations ( stimulator flashes ) , that track the responsivity variations .",
    "nevertheless , the noise properties at faint fluxes are still being investigated at both 70 and 160  @xmath1 . in this work",

    "to control the sample and the selection function , we accepted source detections only where the redundancy was high ( typically 80% or more of the mean weight ) , avoiding the edges and the noisiest areas of the images .",
    "the resulting positions were fed to daophot @xcite in iraf for psf fitting .",
    "we checked that the residual maps were indeed free of sources .    at 70  @xmath0 m",
    "the photometric calibration is derived from many observation campaigns , and its uncertainty is conservatively estimated at the order of 20% .",
    "we use only detections at 15 mjy and brighter in the cdfs , 25 mjy and brighter in marano , and 80 mjy and brighter in the botes field .",
    "these flux levels are determined using the sharp decrease in the counts due to the incompleteness effect . at 160  @xmath0 m",
    ", the calibration is based on a combination of observations of standard stars , asteroids , and comparisons with measurements with other fir missions ( _ iso _ , _ cobe _ , and modeling including iras measurements ) .",
    "it is also estimated to be accurate to about 20% .",
    "we have included in our counts only objects of 50mjy and brighter in the cdfs , and marano ( levels determined using incompleteness as at 70  @xmath0 m ) . because of the low redundancy level of the 160  @xmath0 m data in the botes field , we postpone using it for a later paper .",
    "catalogs were produced separately at each wavelength ; surveys at each wavelength are thus _ unbiased_. detected fir sources in the cdfs sort as follows . for sources selected at 70  @xmath0 m : 92% have a 24  @xmath0 m",

    "down to 50 mjy , 123 sources were detected in the cdfs , and 89 sources in marano .",
    "the source density corresponds to about 150 beams per source at 70  @xmath0 m and 15 at 160  @xmath0 m , using the definition of @xcite .",

    "have not been merged and have been overplotted .",
    "one should keep in mind that mips source counts will eventually go deeper and will be corrected for incompleteness .",
    "the observed fields nicely complement each other in terms of area and depth .",
    "this allows us to probe a flux range of almost 2 orders of magnitude at 70  @xmath0 m .",
    "one order of magnitude is covered at 160 @xmath0 m .",
    "it is possible to check consistency and the cosmic variance in the common flux density range . at 70  @xmath0 m , in the range 25 to 100 mjy where three fields overlap in flux density , the differential counts are almost consistent within the error bars . at 160  @xmath0 m , in the range 100 to 300 mjy ,",
    "the differential counts are consistent within the error bars . at both wavelengths , number counts in cdfs",
    "appear consistently lower than in marano .",
    "a selection of recent models is shown in figure  [ fig : sourcecounts_int_and_diff_legend_0070 ] , including a non - evolution scenario .",
    "the most striking result is the strong excess of mips 70  @xmath0 m sources compared to the non - evolution model : a factor of 3 at around 20 - 30 mjy .",
    "strong evolution had been reported previously at 60 and 90 @xmath0 m , and these data provide unambiguous confirmation .",
    "two models lie close to the data : @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these models , developed to fit observables mostly from _ iras _ , _ iso _ and scuba surveys as well as the cib spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , are based on a strong evolution of luminous ( and ultra - luminous ) infrared galaxies ( lirg and ulirg ) .",
    "the latter model predicts a peak in the redshift distributions of resolved sources at 70  @xmath0 m near @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : zcontrib_counts]a shows the galaxy contribution to the differential counts , as a function of redshift , from the @xcite model . between @xmath55 and @xmath5100 mjy , sources at @xmath6 contribute the most to the counts . at brighter fluxes ( reached by _ iras _ and _ iso _ ) , contributions from local galaxies are more important .",
    "the source counts integrated at 70  @xmath0 m correspond to a brightness of 0.022 mjy / sr or 0.95 nw / m@xmath7/sr .",
    "the value of the cib at this wavelength is not known accurately owing to contamination by zodiacal light . if we use the cib value from the model of @xcite , the mips counts show that at 70  @xmath0 m about 23% of the 70  @xmath0 m cib is already resolved .      at 160  @xmath0 m ,",
    "the comparison with the _ iso _ firback 170  @xmath0 m survey @xcite shows that the counts are consistent and within the error bars in the whole common range , 180 - 300 mjy .",
    "observations @xcite agree as well .",
    "figure  [ fig : sourcecounts_int_and_diff_legend_0160 ] overplots the same models as at 70  @xmath0 m .",
    "the evolution detected at 170  @xmath0 m is confirmed at 160  @xmath0 m , down to fainter levels . at about 100 mjy , an excess of sources by more than a factor of 2 is observed compared to a non - evolution scenario .",
    "interestingly , as for 70  @xmath0 m , the observed evolution is better fitted by the models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the observed slope also agrees with @xcite .",
    "we have constrained the bright end of galaxy number counts at 170  @xmath0 m by using data from the isophot serendipity survey ( isoss ) .",
    "isoss provides a total sky coverage of 15% and is virtually complete at a flux density level of @xmath8 .",
    "based on all optically identified galaxies detected by isoss @xcite we have derived an integral number density of @xmath9 gal.sr@xmath10 galaxies at high galactic latitudes .",
    "this point is perfectly matched by the model of @xcite .",
    "the most striking result of the models that fit the number counts is the existence of two regimes in flux density . in the _ iso",
    "_ range ( fluxes above 200 mjy ) most of the sources contributing to the counts are local ; this is confirmed by observation @xcite . at fainter fluxes , between @xmath510 and 200 mjy ,",
    "the counts should be dominated by a population located at redshifts between 0.7 and 0.9 .",
    "the source counts integrated at 160  @xmath0 m correspond to a brightness of 0.07 mjy / sr or 1.4 nw / m@xmath7/sr .",
    "the cib value at this wavelength is 1 mjy / sr @xcite ; the mips counts show that at 160  @xmath0 m about 7% of the cib is resolved .",
    "since these counts are preliminary , are not corrected for incompleteness , and are subject to cosmic variance , we anticipate that the actual value might be higher .",
    "the first mips far - infrared source counts , spanning about 2 orders of magnitude in flux density at 70  @xmath0 m ( and one at 160  @xmath0 m ) , are consistent on the bright end with previous observations , and show on the faint end unambiguous evolution .",
    "models predict that most of the sources lie at @xmath4 with a tail up to @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this work and companion papers about source counts at 24  @xmath0 m @xcite , about confusion at 24 , 70 and 160  @xmath0 m @xcite , and about the interpretation of these new data from the _ spitzer _ cosmological surveys @xcite , bring new light on the statistical properties of galaxies in an unexplored regime in flux density , and likely in a critical region of redshift space ( up to redshifts @xmath11 ) in the fir @xcite .",
