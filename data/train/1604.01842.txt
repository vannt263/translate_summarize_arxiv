    "to date , various observational discoveries including the accelerating expansion of the universe , primordial nucleosynthesis , the structure of the cosmic microwave background , and the large - scale clustering of galaxies support the @xmath2 cold dark matter ( @xmath3 ) model as the standard cosmological paradigm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . nevertheless , the nature of dark matter ( dm ) itself is still mysterious .",
    "in particular , analytical calculations and numerical simulations based on the cdm assumption suggest a significant excess in the number of substructures as compared to the observed population of satellite galaxies around the milky way ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . hence , observationally quantifying the abundance and mass function of substructure , especially _",

    "dark substructures within lensing galaxies can induce observationally perceptible signals and therefore be indirectly detected .",
    "in particular , perturbations by dark substructures on the lensing magnification , which is sensitive to the second derivatives of the lensing potential , can occasionally become very strong .",
    "as first discussed by @xcite , such perturbations on the magnification can be used as an explanation of the flux - ratio anomalies , which is the failure of smooth lens models in recovering the observed flux ratios of some lens systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "note that similar effects can also be caused by low - mass structures along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "astrometric perturbations by dark substructures , on the other hand , are usually too small for any substructure inference . if the surface brightness of the source further varies in time , then the time delays between multiple lensed images can be used as an extra test for the presence of substructures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    nevertheless , for extended static sources , the direct observable is the surface - brightness perturbation , a combination of both astrometric and magnification perturbations . by modeling such surface - brightness perturbations as a result of potential perturbations from dark substructures ,",
    "recent studies have found strong evidence for the presence of dark substructures in several lensing systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , a large sample of such detections is needed for a statistical study of dark substructure .    motivated by the success of the sloan lens acs survey ( slacs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) emission line lens survey ( bells , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the slacs for the masses survey ( s4tm , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in uncovering significant new strong - lens samples , we initiated the bells for the galaxy - ly@xmath0 emitter systems survey ( the bells gallery survey hereafter ) for dark - substructure detections in galaxy - scale gravitational lenses with high - redshift ly@xmath0 emitters ( laes ) as the lensed sources .",
    "the lens candidates of the bells gallery survey are spectroscopically selected from the final data release , data release 12 ( dr12 ) , of the boss @xcite of the sloan digital sky survey iii ( sdss - iii , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , using selection techniques similar to those employed in the slacs , bells , and s4tm surveys . a hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ )",
    "follow - up imaging program has been approved and the observations are currently underway ( _ hst _ cycle 23 , go program # 14189 , pi : a. s. bolton ) .",
    "the candidate systems are massive galaxies at redshifts of approximately 0.5 , whose boss spectra show ly@xmath0 emission from more distant laes at redshifts of 23 .",
    "extensive studies have demonstrated that the lower - mass limit of substructures that can produce observable lensing signals is related to the characteristic size of the lensed source , with smaller sources being sensitive to perturbations by smaller mass substructures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is intuitively understandable by noting that smaller lensing masses have smaller associated lensing deflection angles , and lensed sources with smaller - scale structures subtending smaller angles will be correspondingly sensitive to the effects of these smaller lensing masses .",
    "furthermore , as discussed by @xcite , the `` cut - off '' mass can be estimated as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the characteristic length scale of the lensed source .",
    "when observed at optical wavelengths , high - redshift laes will show structure on small scales corresponding to the far - uv emission from intense localized regions of star formation .",
    "lensed laes can hence push the detection limit of dark substructure down by roughly an order of magnitude in terms of its mass when comparing to the currently existing galaxy  galaxy lens samples in which the typical source size is a few times larger .",
    "importantly , this lower - mass detection threshold can also raise the number of expected substructure detections , since lower - mass dark substructures are predicted to be significantly more abundant than higher mass substructures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , the capability of detecting low - mass dark substructures is crucial for constraining the nature of dm because the differences in substructure properties predicted by cdm and other alternatives such as warm and self - interacting dm become significantly larger for lower substructure masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    the sample of lensed laes to be delivered by the bells gallery survey will also be an invaluable resource for the study of high - redshift laes themselves .",
    "laes are believed to be young , low - mass , extremely star - forming galaxies that serve as the progenitors of modern massive galaxies .",
    "they hold clues to the formation and evolution of galaxies at the time when the universe was still young .",
    "they can be used as tracers of the large - scale structure to constrain cosmological parameters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and as a probe of the high - redshift intergalactic medium even across the reionization epoch ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the magnification effect of gravitational lensing in this new sample provides a `` cosmic telescope '' for these objects , allowing us to probe their detailed structure below 100 pc scales , which are otherwise beyond current observational capabilities .",

    "strong - lensing probability is discussed in section 4 .",
    "discussions on the unique studies enabled by this galaxy  lae lens sample are given in section 5 .",
    "the final conclusion is in section 6 .",
    "the selection technique for the bells gallery survey is based on the technique employed in the previous slacs , bells , and the s4tm surveys , but with substantial modifications to specifically select lensed high - redshift laes .",
    "the basic principle of the selection technique is to identify a `` rogue '' emission line in the spectrum of a boss survey target galaxy , which can be an indication of a lensing configuration with two objects along the same line of sight .",
    "a detailed description of the selection technique adopted for the bells gallery survey is presented in this section .",
    "this technique is implemented by code that is released publicly with the publication of this paper .      to ensure an accurate quantification of the detection significance of candidate rogue emission lines ,",
    "the first step is to obtain an accurate estimate of the spectroscopic flux errors across the observed spectra .",
    "the boss spectroscopic pipeline reports noise vectors that are reasonably accurate at most wavelengths , but underestimate the effects of systematic sky - subtraction residuals at wavelengths with strong airglow lines .",
    "therefore , we recalibrate the reported noise vectors empirically using the sky - subtracted data for the @xmath6 blank - sky fibers on every boss spectroscopic plate .",
    "we define the parent sample for our search by selecting all plates with `` good '' quality ( as indicated by the ` platequality ` flag in sdss terminology ) . for each of these plates ,",
    "we select all the sky - model - subtracted blank - sky spectra . we reject from our parent sample any plates that have a root mean square ( rms ) error - scaled residual flux across all sky spectra of 1.4 or greater , taking this as an indication of unusually poor sky subtraction . this rms statistic would in principle",
    "be 1 for all spectra if all noise were gaussian , all errors were correctly estimated , and all sky foregrounds were perfectly subtracted .",
    "we then compute the rms of the error - weighted blank - sky residuals across all retained plates at each wavelength .",
    "the result is a spectrum of empirical values @xmath7 ( the black line in the top panel of figure  [ fig : renorm ] ) indicating the factor by which errors are underestimated as a function of wavelength .",
    "the easiest procedure for applying this spectrum would be to simply inflate all reported errors by this wavelength - dependent factor @xmath8 .",
    "however , in some spectral ranges that are relatively free of sky emission lines , the rms error - weighted residual flux is less than unity as a result of spectral rebinning effects .",
    "since we wish to be conservative in our estimates of detection significance and not _ deflate _ any error estimates , we fit a smooth b - spline model to the baseline trend of @xmath7 , masking the spectral ranges that are significantly affected by airglow lines .",
    "the red line in the top panel of figure  [ fig : renorm ] represents the b - spline fit , and the gray - shaded regions visualize the masked spectral ranges .",
    "we divide @xmath7 by this baseline fit to obtain the factor by which we rescale all our error estimates in subsequent analysis steps .",
    "the bottom panel in figure  [ fig : renorm ] shows the resulting rescaling factor as a function of wavelength .",
    "note that the rescaling factors are forced to be at least unity ."
