    "in the past decades experimental advances in the control of cold atomic ensembles @xcite have paved the way for the study of dynamical properties of quantum many - body systems @xcite . among these rydberg gases , e.g. ensembles of atoms with a valence electron excited to a state with a high principal quantum number ,",
    "have been subject to intense study @xcite .",
    "rydberg atoms feature strong van der waals or dipole - dipole interactions , leading to so - called blockade effects , whereby an excited atom inhibits the laser excitation of other atoms in its vicinity @xcite .",
    "the presence of the blockade effect has been shown to have remarkable impacts both on the statics @xcite and the dynamics @xcite of rydberg ensembles .",
    "when studying quantum many - body systems with cold atoms the aim is typically to conduct experiments in the coherent limit , i.e. in the absence of noise .",
    "however , the experimental exploration of open quantum systems that are subject to noise has lately become very active . in rydberg gases",
    "this dissipative regime features rich equilibrium @xcite and out - of - equilibrium @xcite physics .",
    "moreover , dissipation has been shown to be a resource for the engineering of entangled quantum states @xcite .",
    "recently , a number of theoretical works have focused on studying rydberg gases in the presence of strong dephasing noise @xcite . in this regime",
    "all quantum coherences are suppressed on the relevant time scale , and the time evolution of the system can be described perturbatively by means of a stochastic equation which acts only on the diagonal elements of the density matrix , i.e. classically accessible states .",
    "this case can therefore be thought of as a classical markovian process with configuration - dependent rates @xcite .",
    "this strongly dissipative limit displays a rich dynamics , with features such as glassiness @xcite , aggregation effects associated with the detuning between the laser field and the atomic transition @xcite , and scale invariance in the distribution of excitations @xcite .",
    "some of these phenomena have also been observed experimentally , thus indicating the physical relevance of the effective dynamics @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate to what extent and in what form the results obtained in the strongly dissipative limit survive when quantum superpositions can not be neglected on relevant dynamical time scales , and coherent and dissipative processes compete . for this purpose , we integrate numerically the quantum master equation of the system for different dissipation strengths . for computational reasons , we consider a chain of @xmath0 atoms .",
    "this is far from the large number of particles which can be tackled in the classical limit but nevertheless such system sizes are of relevance for current experimental setups that explore rydberg ensembles in microtrap arrays @xcite .    in order to be able to systematically explore the transition from the classical to the quantum limit we start by introducing a generalised blockade radius",
    "this allows us to ensure that the only relevant length scale in the non - equilibrium dynamics is kept constant as the dissipation strength is varied .",
    "we then explore the growth of the density of rydberg excitations and the dynamics of rydberg - blockade effects as seen in the behaviour of two - point correlations . as a main result we find indications that there is a regime in which the system displays a power - law growth of the density of excitations ( as predicted in @xcite for the classical limit ) even if the dissipation rate is only moderately high , or even weak compared to the driving .",
    "we would like to remark that the interplay between classical and quantum dynamics in rydberg ensembles was also explored in a recent paper by mattioli _",
    "@xcite in a slightly different context . here",
    "a system of three - level atoms that include a short - lived excited state with a lower energy than the rydberg state was investigated .",
    "such system allows for the non - equilibrium dynamics to be tuned from the classical to the quantum regime by varying the strength of the laser driving to the intermediate level . while both papers have some conceptual similarities , our perspective is somewhat different , as we aim to explore the influence of increasing quantum effects starting from a classical setting whose dynamics has been thoroughly investigated in the past .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section 2 we provide details on the numerical methods and discuss the definition of the blockade radius as well as its dependence on the system parameters .",
    "in section 3 we explore the dynamics of the excitation density and the density - density correlation function for different dissipation strengths .",
    "section 4 contains a summary and discussion of the results as well as an outlook .",

    "we see that in the fully coherent case the correlation function oscillates strongly and excitations are anti - correlated for almost all times .",
    "this is expected since the blockade is enforced due to energetic reasons that prevent the simultaneous excitation of nearby atoms .    in the dissipative case , however , we observe that after an initial period of anti - correlation @xmath90 drifts towards positive values .",
    "the reason is that the dissipative system allows transitions which are  energetically forbidden \" in the closed system .",
    "in fact this is necessary to ultimately reach the uncorrelated stationary state in which excited atoms can appear at any distance . as a consequence the blockade is dynamical in the sense that the effective blockade radius is shrinking with time @xcite .",

    "we see that , in agreement with the illustration provided in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , larger dissipation leads to a more classical dynamics , while for weak dissipation the presence of quantum superpositions becomes more evidently manifest . in all cases",
    "the first excitations emerge beyond the blockade radius @xmath37 , regardless of the strength of the dissipations . at later times , however , individual excitations can penetrate into the blockaded domain which is  energetically forbidden \" and thus can only be accessed due to the dissipative dynamics and not by the quantum evolution .",

    "however , they are rarer and on average take longer to occur .",
    "the aim of this paper was to investigate the interplay between quantum driving and dissipation in a rydberg lattice gas .",
    "in particular , we were interested in understanding the dynamics of this system using the strongly dissipative limit as starting point",
    ". here the evolution of the system is governed by effectively classical rate equations which predict interesting features such as an algebraic growth of the excitation density ( with exponent @xmath94 ) and a dynamically shrinking blockade radius .",
    "our results suggest that these features persist until deep into the quantum regime .",
    "this can be qualitatively understood in the following way .",
    "even deep in the quantum regime ( i.e. @xmath95 ) the stationary state is the completely mixed state .",
    "this means that there is a timescale beyond which the density of excitations @xmath96 is sufficiently large so that the interaction of an atom with the `` background '' will shift its coherent excitation out of resonance .",
    "therefore the approach to the steady state must eventually proceed through incoherent jumps in order for the system to reach its dense stationary state .",

    "<S> in the presence of strong dephasing noise the dynamics of rydberg gases becomes effectively classical , due to the rapid decay of quantum superpositions between atomic levels . </S>",
    "<S> recently a great deal of attention has been devoted to the stochastic dynamics that emerges in that limit , revealing several interesting features , including kinetically - constrained glassy behaviour , self - similarity and aggregation effects . however , the non - equilibrium physics of these systems , in particular in the regime where coherent and dissipative processes contribute on equal footing , is yet far from being understood . to explore this we study the dynamics of a small one - dimensional rydberg lattice gas subject to dephasing noise by numerically integrating the quantum master equation . </S>",
    "<S> we interpolate between the coherent and the strongly dephased regime by defining a generalised concept of a blockade length . </S>",
    "<S> we find indications that the main features observed in the strongly dissipative limit persist when the dissipation is not strong enough to annihilate quantum coherences at the dynamically relevant time scales . </S>",
    "<S> these features include the existence of a time - dependent rydberg blockade radius , and a growth of the density of excitations which is compatible with the power - law behaviour expected in the classical limit . </S>"
