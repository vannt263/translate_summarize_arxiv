    "<S> scattering is an important phenomenon which is observed in systems ranging from the micro- to macroscale . in the context of nuclear reaction theory </S>",
    "<S> the heidelberg approach was proposed and later demonstrated to be applicable to many chaotic scattering systems . to model the universal properties , </S>",
    "<S> stochasticity is introduced to the scattering matrix on the level of the hamiltonian by using random matrices . </S>",
    "<S> a long - standing problem was the computation of the distribution of the off - diagonal scattering - matrix elements . </S>",
    "<S> we report here an exact solution to this problem and present analytical results for systems with preserved and with violated time - reversal invariance . </S>",
    "<S> our derivation is based on a new variant of the supersymmetry method . </S>",
    "<S> we also validate our results with scattering data obtained from experiments with microwave billiards .    </S>",
    "<S> a large part of our knowledge about quantum systems comes from scattering experiments . even in classical wave systems </S>",
    "<S> , observables can often be traced back to a scattering process  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> important examples stem from nuclear , atomic and molecular physics , mesoscopic ballistic devices , and even from classical wave systems as , e.g. , microwave and elastomechanical billiards , as well as from wireless communication  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the investigation of scattering phenomena has been a subject of major interest from both theoretical and experimental points of view . </S>",
    "<S> here we focus on the universal features of chaotic scattering systems .    </S>",
    "<S> the quantity of interest is the scattering matrix ( @xmath0 matrix ) which relates the asymptotic initial and final states , and owing to the flux conservation requirement is unitary . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-matrix elements are given in terms of the hamiltonian @xmath1 describing the scattering center  @xcite by @xmath2 where the inverse of the resolvent @xmath3 reads @xmath4 the coupling vectors @xmath5 account for the interaction between the internal states of @xmath1 and the @xmath6 open channel states labeled @xmath7 where the full system resides asymptotically before , respectively , after the scattering event . </S>",
    "<S> this ansatz yields the most general description of any scattering process in which an interaction zone and scattering channels can be identified . </S>",
    "<S> without loss of generality we may restrict ourselves to a diagonal average @xmath0 matrix  @xcite , that is , to orthogonal coupling vectors , viz . </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath8 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the chaoticity of the dynamics in the scattering center is taken into account by assuming that @xmath1 is a random matrix . </S>",
    "<S> this is referred to as the heidelberg approach  @xcite as distinguished from the mexico approach  @xcite where stochasticity is introduced in the @xmath0 matrix itself . in view of the universality conjecture  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the hamiltonian @xmath1 is modeled by the gaussian ensemble of @xmath9 random matrices with the distribution  @xcite , @xmath10 . here , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11 fixes the energy scale and the index @xmath12 characterizes the symmetry class , i.e. , the invariance properties of the hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the cases @xmath13 ( gaussian orthogonal ensemble , goe ) and @xmath14 ( gaussian unitary ensemble , gue ) which apply to systems with , respectively , preserved and violated time - reversal ( @xmath15 ) invariance  @xcite ; the former being rotationally invariant as well </S>",
    "<S> . the universal spectral properties of closed chaotic systems deduced from these ensembles are by now well understood  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> those of the effective hamiltonian associated with a chaotic scattering process , which includes @xmath1 and the coupling to the exterior have been derived , e.g. , in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> its complex eigenvalues can be extracted from the measured resonance spectra  @xcite in general only in the regimes of isolated and weakly overlapping resonances . accordingly </S>",
    "<S> a description of the universal properties of the @xmath0 matrix itself is indispensable .    in their pioneering work  </S>",

    "<S> further progress in this direction was made in  @xcite where three- and four - point @xmath0-matrix correlation functions were evaluated . </S>",
    "<S> while these provide rich information about the scattering process , a full statistical description requires the determination of the distributions of the @xmath0-matrix elements . </S>",
    "<S> their knowledge yields information about all their moments and is highly desirable also from an experimental viewpoint  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the distributions and higher moments have been known hitherto only in the limit of a large number @xmath6 of open channels and a vanishing average @xmath0 matrix , i.e. , in the ericson regime  @xcite or in a high - loss environment  @xcite . there </S>",
    "<S> the real and the imaginary parts of the @xmath0-matrix elements are gaussian distributed . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise the deviations from this behavior are significant due to the unitarity of the @xmath0 matrix  @xcite . the complexity involved in the calculations of the correlation functions  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite indicates that those of the distributions of the @xmath0-matrix elements constitute a challenging task . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath16 , was calculated . </S>",
    "<S> these results have been verified in microwave experiments  @xcite . in the present letter </S>",
    "<S> , we provide analytical results for the distributions of the off - diagonal @xmath0-matrix elements which could not be computed with the well - established methods  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the novelty of our approach lies in that a nonlinear sigma model is constructed based on the _ characteristic function _ associated with the distributions which is the generating function for the moments . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the standard supersymmetry approach starts from the generating function for the @xmath0-matrix correlations .      for @xmath44 </S>",

    "<S> in addition , we symmetrize the vector @xmath53 using @xmath54 along with @xmath55 , thereby doubling its size as well . </S>",

    "<S> the orthogonality of @xmath5 leads to @xmath75 with @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , @xmath71 equals a linear combination of matrix elements of @xmath77 multiplied with @xmath78 , where @xmath79 . in eq .   </S>",
    "<S> the first term is of order @xmath80 while the rest is of order @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in order to perform the limit @xmath82 , we may apply the saddle point approximation . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a separation of @xmath67 into goldstone modes @xmath83 and massive modes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the integrals over the latter , being gaussian ones , can be readily done and yield unity . </S>",
    "<S> we are therefore left with an expression involving only the goldstone modes , and consequently our sigma model reads @xmath84 with sdet denoting the superdeterminant and @xmath67 replaced by @xmath85 in all the ingredients of eq .  </S>",

    "<S> the exponential part in eq .   also involves other variables and is quite complicated for @xmath13 .    for @xmath44 the integrals over the grassmann variables and the angles can be performed and we obtain the same distribution for the real and imaginary parts , @xmath100 where @xmath101 represents the @xmath102th order bessel function of the first kind , and @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> the  1 \" in eq .   is an efetov - wegner contribution  @xcite which is essential for the correct normalization , @xmath104 . </S>",
