    "modern electronic - structure calculations for atoms , molecules , and solids usually rely upon kohn - sham ( ks ) density - functional theory ( dft),@xcite in which only @xmath0 $ ] , the exchange - correlation ( xc ) energy as a functional of electron density , must be approximated .",
    "semi - empirical approximations tend to be limited to systems that resemble those in the fitted data set ( typically small molecules ) , but nonempirical ones are constructed to satisfy universal constraints and so should have a wider range of applicability.@xcite for example , it is expected that a good description of chemical reactions at a solid surface requires a good description of both the molecules and the surface .",
    "jellium is a simple model of a simple metal , in which the valence electrons are neutralized by a uniform positive background that extends up to a sharp planar surface .",
    "the apparent success of the simplest density functional , the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) , for the jellium surface energy@xcite motivated early interest in density functionals and in refinements of the lsda such as the generalized gradient approximation ( gga).@xcite    it was therefore a matter of some concern when wavefunction - based fermi hypernetted - chain ( fhnc)@xcite and fixed - node diffusion monte carlo ( dmc)@xcite calculations for jellium slabs ( and their extrapolation to infinite thickness ) predicted surface energies considerably higher than those obtained in the lsda . indeed , dmc is usually a gold standard of accuracy .",
    "however , it encounters special difficulties for jellium slabs;@xcite furthermore , the large deviations between the available dmc and lsda calculations have been attributed in part to inconsistency between the energy of the inhomogeneous system and that of the corresponding homogeneous electron gas.@xcite recent approaches@xcite have all suggested that the actual jellium surface energies are only a little higher than those obtained in the lsda .",
    "the jellium surface - energy story is presented in full detail in ref .  .",
    "in this paper , we perform a detailed analysis of exchange and correlation in jellium slabs , _ exact _ at the level of the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , to show that the most refined nonempirical density functional , the meta - generalized gradient approximation of tao , perdew , staroverov , and scuseria ( tpss meta - gga),@xcite can account even for the most long - ranged xc effects at a jellium surface .",
    "this is a considerable achievement for a semi - local functional that is inherently more reliable for short - ranged effects than for long - ranged ones .",
    "rpa is known to be correct at long range ; because it has serious deficiencies at short - range and , therefore , can not be compared to standard versions of the semi - local functionals , we use rpa versions of these functionals in this test .    in order to separate long - range and short - range xc effects , we look at the surface contribution to the spherically - averaged real - space xc hole , averaged over the electron density of the system , and its fourier transform ( wavevector analysis ) .",
    "langreth and perdew@xcite showed that the exact xc energy of an arbitrary inhomogeneous system can be obtained from a three - dimensional ( 3d ) fourier transform of the spherical average of the xc hole density , which is a function of a 3d wavevector @xmath1 . in the case of a plane - bounded electron gas , this wavevector - dependent spherical average is dominated at long wavelengths ( @xmath2 ) by the zero - point energy - shift of the newly created surface collective oscillations ( surface plasmons ) and takes a simple analytical form .",
    "this known limit has been used to carry out a wavevector interpolation correction to lsda,@xcite pbe - gga,@xcite and tpss - metagga@xcite xc surface energies .",
    "the wavevector interpolation corrections to these functionals were controlled@xcite by using the exact rpa values reported in ref .  , and led to a consistent set of predicted surface energies.@xcite    in a dft context , the rpa is based upon the time - dependent hartree approximation for the density - response function but replacing the occupied and unoccupied single - particle hartree orbitals and energies by the corresponding eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the ks hamiltonian of dft.@xcite hence , it describes the exchange energy and the long - range part of the correlation energy correctly .",
    "essentially _ exact _ rpa surface energies were evaluated from single - particle lsda orbitals and energies in ref .  .",
    "these calculations provide an accurate standard against which approximate density functionals ( in their rpa versions ) can be tested and normed .",
    "the rpa versions of lsd and gga were reported in refs .   and  , respectively . because rpa is not self - correlation - free ,",
    "the gga for rpa correlation is its own meta - gga .",
    "the rpa version of the nonempirical tpss meta - gga was investigated in ref .  .",
