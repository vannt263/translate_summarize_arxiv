    "the measurement of distances from trigonometric parallaxes is complicated by the existence of the lutz - kelker bias ( lutz & kelker 1973 ) , which generates selection effects when analyzing a given stellar population and also requires the use of correction factors for the distance to a given star derived from its parallax ( smith 2003 ) .",
    "standard lutz - kelker corrections become significant for observed parallaxes with @xmath0 0.05 and diverge for @xmath1 0.175 ( fig .  1 , left panel ) .",
    "ignoring them can introduce gross errors in any derived quantity . for stars observed with gaia",
    ", unobscured g dwarfs are expected to have @xmath2 0.05 at @xmath3 2 kpc ; that value is achieved for unobscured m dwarfs at distances of @xmath4 500 pc .",
    "it is clear that lutz - kelker corrections will have to be applied to gaia parallaxes for those objects , among others .",
    "the problem is even more serious than that : if we assume a constant underlying constant spatial distribution @xmath5 and a gaussian distribution for the parallax uncertainty ( i.e. the standard assumptions for lutz - kelker corrections ) , the real distance @xmath6 probability distributions for individual stars , @xmath7 , will always be ill - behaved for @xmath8 , even for small values of @xmath9 ( fig .  1 , right panel ) .",
    "this characteristic precludes a precise statistical analysis of parallaxes unless cutoffs are specified for the gaussian distribution .",
    "the situation described in the previous paragraph is actually not a realistic representation of the galactic stellar populations that will be sampled by gaia .",
    "@xmath5 is not expected to be constant ; on the contrary , in most cases it is expected to drop significantly beyond a relatively short distance .",
    "this alleviates or eliminates altogether the ill behavior of @xmath7 for @xmath8 but requires the use of new techniques for its precise calculation .",
    "that is the purpose of this work .",
    "the following procedure can be used for a simple conical or biconical volume centered on the position of the sun .",
    "it can also be adapted with some modifications to other simple geometries involving cone or cylinder sections ( see fig .",
    "2 ) .     of the galactic equator . the shaded area represents the galactic disk with the dashed line being the galactic plane and the sun symbol marking the position of our star .",
    "the hatched regions mark the area excluded to estimate the bias induced by extinction . ]",
    "we start by selecting a distance - limited ( not magnitude - limited ) population along a given direction .",
    "it is possible ( and in most cases expected ) for a good fraction of the sample to have large values of @xmath9 .",
    "negative values of @xmath10 for part of the sample are also possible and , again , expected if the sample is severely lutz - kelker - limited ( for example , if we are dealing with gaia data for dim , low - mass stars ) .",
    "we then assume that @xmath5 is not constant for that population and provide a description in terms of a reasonable functional form that goes to zero as @xmath8 .",
    "for example , one can assume a galactic disk with constant surface density and a gaussian profile in the vertical direction and derive the expected @xmath5 along a given direction .",
    "more complex distributions with multiple components can also be used .",
    "for the next step , an educated guess for the free parameters of the functional form is provided .",
    "this can be deduced from pre - existing data .",
    "then , the probability distribution @xmath7 for each star @xmath11 given @xmath12 , and @xmath13 as :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is a normalization factor .",
    "then we sum over all the stars in that particular direction to obtain the total probability distribution @xmath16 and , if different directions are sampled , a 3-d @xmath17 is derived .",
    "the total probability distribution is then used to derive a @xmath5 by @xmath18 fitting of the free parameters in the chosen functional form .",
    "the procedure is then iterated until convergence . at the end",
    ", the residuals of the fit can be analyzed to check whether the selected functional form is capable of producing a reasonable representation of the data .",
    "if that is not the case , a new functional form can be selected and the process is repeated .",
    "the expected quality and magnitude completeness of gaia data will allow the spatial distribution of different stellar populations to be analyzed with this method .",
    "we have used a variation of this method with a somewhat more complex geometry ( fig .",
    "2 ) to determine the vertical structure of the spatial distribution of early - type stars in the solar neighborbood from hipparcos parallaxes .",
    "the full analysis is available in maz - apellniz ( 2001a ) .",
    "here we summarize the most important results :    the sun is located above the plane of the galaxy at a distance of @xmath19 24.7 @xmath20 1.7 ( random ) @xmath20 0.4 ( systematic ) pc .",
    "this value is consistent with most of the ones obtained by other authors using similar or different populations ( chen et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the scale height of the disk early - type stellar poipulation assuming a self - gravitating , isothermal , single - mass disk is @xmath21 34.2 @xmath20 0.8 ( random ) @xmath20 2.5 ( systematic ) pc .",
    "the data does not have a good enough precision to differentiate between that model and one in which the gravitational field is provided by a constant - density background population , since both functional forms yield similar good values in the @xmath18 fit .",
    "the value for @xmath22 is slightly lower that the one obtained by other authors : the likely reason for this effect is the absence of a thick disk / halo component in previous works ( see below ) .",
    "0 is not considered for the fit , as it corresponds to the space between the two semi - infinite cylinders in fig .  2 .",
    "note that the observed distribution shows `` fractional stars '' due to the procedure used to derive the histogram . ]",
    "the local disk surface density for o - b5 stars is @xmath23 ( 1.62 @xmath20 0.04 ( random ) @xmath20 0.14 ( systematic))@xmath24 10@xmath25 stars kpc@xmath26 .",
    "this is in reasonable agreement with previous studies .",
    "a halo / thick disk component is clearly detected at large distances from the plane ( fig .",
    "the dataset is not good enough to provide detailed information on that population except to detect its presence , infer that it contributes with at least 5% of the total o - b5 stellar population in our region of the galaxy , and deduce that it may extend beyond a distance of 500 pc from the galactic plane .",
    "the origin of such a component is still a matter of debate : most of those stars appear to be runaways ( rolleston et al .",
    "1999 , hoogerwerf et al .",
    "2000 ) but some could have been formed in situ ( conlon et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "the volume within @xmath4 100 pc of the sun is deficient in early - type stars .",
    "beyond there , we start to find ob associations , such as scorpius - centaurus , that compensate the local deficiency ( see also de zeeuw et al . 1999 , maz - apellniz 2001b ) .",
    "we have used these results to include distance information derived from hipparcos parallaxes for some of the stars in our galactic o star catalog ( maz - apellniz et al .",
    "two examples are shown in fig .",
    "we would like to point out that the discrepancies between trigonometric and spectroscopic parallaxes for early - type stars claimed by skrzysky et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and patriarchi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) are due to an incorrect treatment of lutz - kelker corrections ; no discrepancies are found for the distances derived from our method ."
