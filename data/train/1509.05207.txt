    "subsequently , the finished stacks were annealed in forming gas flow at 320@xmath51 for several hours .",
    "the hbn / graphene / hbn heterostructure was then patterned into hall bar shape using electron beam lithography ( ebl ) and chf@xmath52/o@xmath0 ( 40 sccm/6 sccm , 60 watt power ) based reactive ion etching ( rie ) @xcite .",
    "cr / au side contacts were defined with ebl and deposited by thermal evaporation and lift - off after brief oxygen plasma cleaning of the contact areas @xcite .",

    "<S> * *    graphene samples can have a very high carrier mobility if influences from the substrate and the environment are minimized . </S>",
    "<S> embedding a graphene sheet into a heterostructure with hexagonal boron nitride ( hbn ) on both sides was shown to be a particularly efficient way of achieving a high bulk mobility @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nanopatterning graphene can add extra damage and drastically reduce sample mobility by edge disorder @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> preparing etched graphene nanostructures on top of an hbn substrate instead of sio@xmath0 is no remedy , as transport characteristics are still dominated by edge roughness @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that etching fully encapsulated graphene on the nanoscale is more gentle and the high mobility can be preserved . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we prepared graphene antidot lattices @xcite where we observe magnetotransport features stemming from ballistic transport . </S>",
    "<S> due to the short lattice period in our samples we can also explore the boundary between the classical and the quantum transport regime .    in single layer graphene </S>",
    "<S> the charge carriers are completely exposed to the environment , which limits their mobility . </S>",
    "<S> placing graphene on hexagonal boron nitride ( hbn ) was shown to improve the carrier mobility @xcite , allowing the observation of ballistic transport or the fractional quantum hall effect in bulk graphene @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , a dry stacking technique was introduced , which allows complete encapsulation of graphene into layers of hbn and excludes any contamination from process chemicals such as electron beam resist @xcite . to obtain graphene nanodevices , chemically prepared graphene nanostructures @xcite are a potential route for certain applications , </S>",
    "<S> however , the high flexibility of a top down patterning approach is extremely desirable . </S>",
    "<S> graphene antidot lattices can help circumventing the problem of the missing band gap in transistor applications @xcite , and were even predicted to serve as the technological basis for spin qubits @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , for advanced graphene nanodevices , not only the bulk mobility has to be improved , but the nanopatterning has to be optimised .    </S>",
    "<S> here we present experiments on graphene antidot lattices @xcite etched into hbn / graphene / hbn heterostructures with lattice periods going down to @xmath1 nm . </S>",
    "<S> magnetotransport on those samples shows commensurability features stemming from ballistic orbits around one or several antidots . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to prove that the high carrier mobility is preserved in the nanopatterning step even though the zero field resistance is dominated by scattering on the artificial nanopattern , giving an apparent reduction of the mobility . </S>",
    "<S> the small feature size of our samples also allows us to approach the region where the classical picture of cyclotron orbits no longer applies . </S>",
    "<S> this classical to quantum crossover is governed by the ratio between the fermi wavelength @xmath2 of the carriers and the dimensions of the nanopattern .    to obtain embedded graphene samples , </S>",
    "<S> hbn / graphene / hbn stacks were prepared using the dry stacking technique , patterned into hall bar shape , and contacted using cr / au @xcite . in hbn / graphene / hbn samples prepared by this method </S>",
    "<S> , we routinely obtained carrier mobilities in excess of @xmath3 @xmath4/vs , showing all integer quantum hall states starting from a few tesla . in one sample without antidots and a mobility of @xmath5 @xmath4/vs we also observed the fractional quantum hall effect at @xmath6 k. this shows that our fabrication procedure is mature and consistently yields high sample qualities . </S>",
    "<S> the samples presented in this study did not show any signs of a moir superlattice @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> afterwards , an antidot lattice was patterned . </S>",
    "<S> ( for fabrication details , see methods section ) . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 shows an optical micrograph of a finished sample and a scanning electron micrograph of a sample after measuring . </S>",
    "<S> a sketch of the antidot lattice , etched into the stack is also shown . </S>",
    "<S> the antidot lattice period @xmath7 was varied between 50 nm and 250 nm . </S>",
    "<S> the antidot diameter @xmath8 was lithographically defined to be about 40 nm , but due to the conical etching profile , the actual diameter in the graphene plane is smaller . using sem inspection , we estimate it to be about @xmath9 nm .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , we show data for a sample with a lattice period of @xmath10 nm . from the gate response of the conductivity at a magnetic field @xmath11 , shown in fig . 2a , we calculate an apparent field effect mobility of @xmath12 @xmath4/vs . at a carrier density @xmath13 @xmath14 </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to an apparent mean free path of about @xmath15 nm . we estimate the intrinsic mean free path to be about 1400 nm @xcite(see supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> magnetotransport traces of this device ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2b ) show pronounced peaks at field values where the cyclotron diameter @xmath16 is commensurate to the square antidot lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the peak belonging to @xmath17 , the fundamental antidot peak , is most pronounced . </S>",
    "<S> additional peaks appearing at lower fields correspond to orbits encircling 2 , and 4 antidots @xcite ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1d ) , confirming a mean free path which spans several lattice periods . </S>",
    "<S> while in a simple picture only the unperturbed orbits encircling the antidots are responsible for the magnetotransport features , a more detailed analysis based on the kubo formula shows that velocity correlations in the chaotic trajectories , which occupy the largest part of the phase space , result in the magnetoresistance peaks @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most of the orbits therefore hit the antidot edges several times within a mean free path . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the visibility of the antidot peaks not only proves a high bulk mobility , but also shows that scattering at the edges does not cut off the trajectories and we can conclude that the high carrier mobility also survives after nanopatterning .    at higher fields </S>",
    "<S> , the cyclotron diameter @xmath18 is reduced below the neck width @xmath19 in between the antidots . </S>",
    "<S> we can observe shubnikov - de haas oscillations , eventually resulting in a well - defined quantum hall effect . at @xmath20 t </S>",
    "<S> we clearly observe the @xmath21 plateau , which again shows the high sample quality ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2c ) . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluated the carrier density dependence of the magnetoresistance peaks corresponding to orbits around 1 , 2 and 4 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2d ) and found that the peaks were always well described by a square root dependence of the cyclotron diameter on the carrier density down to @xmath22 @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> quantitatively , we confirmed the formula for the cyclotron diameter for graphene given above , which contains spin and valley degeneracy .    </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3a shows the magnetoresistance of a sample with @xmath23 nm at @xmath24 @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the apparent hall mobility at this density is about @xmath25 @xmath4/vs . again , scattering at the antidot potential limits the apparent mobility @xcite , but the intrinsic mobility is higher as we clearly observe magnetoresistance peaks for @xmath26 antidots , and a fourth peak at lower fields is weakly visible . ishizaka and ando studied how the visibility of the higher order antidot peaks depends on the mobility @xcite . from their data , we estimate that the intrinsic mean free path must be at least 400 nm , well in excess of the apparent mean free path of 160 nm ( see supplementary information ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the good visibility of the @xmath27 peak confirms the small aspect ratio @xmath28 @xcite , in agreement with our sem analysis and also with the onset of the well - defined shubnikov - de haas oscillations in our magnetotransport data . </S>",
    "<S> all these approaches give an antidot diameter of @xmath29 nm .    in experiments in gaas </S>",
    "<S> based antidot lattices it was found that due to depletion at the antidot boundaries , the potential can be very soft and small lattice periods are hard to realize . in our case </S>",
    "<S> the data compares well to hard - wall potential lattices in gaas , which could be realized in gaas only at much larger lattice periods @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also compared data for similar carrier densities in the electron and hole regime in fig . 3b and found the graphs to be virtually identical . </S>",
    "<S> this proves that there is no edge doping at the antidot boundaries , which would have led to different potential shapes in the electron and hole regime due to fermi level pinning at the edges .    </S>",
    "<S> now let us discuss the transition between the quantum and the classical transport regime . </S>",
    "<S> in gaas - based heterostructures , the smallest lattice period realised so far was @xmath30 nm , and required critical tuning of the etch depth @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , due to the lack of a depletion region in graphene the fabrication of samples with a very small lattice period is less critical , and the carrier density is widely tunable . </S>",
    "<S> also , due to valley degeneracy , the fermi wavelength in graphene , @xmath31 is a factor of @xmath32 larger than in gaas based 2degs at the same carrier density . </S>",
    "<S> thus we can explore the transition from the semi - classical to the quantum regime @xcite , where a description in terms of classical orbits is no longer justified . in the samples with </S>",
    "<S> @xmath33 nm we are able to study this transition . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4a shows the disappearance of the main antidot peak in a sample with @xmath34 nm as the carrier density is lowered , making @xmath2 longer . </S>",
    "<S> we find that this peak is only visible at densities above @xmath35 @xmath14 , corresponding to @xmath36 nm . </S>",
    "<S> also , in two samples with @xmath23 nm , we observe that the main antidot peak becomes visible for densities larger than @xmath37 @xmath14 , which corresponds to @xmath38 nm . </S>",
    "<S> in a sample with @xmath39 nm , we observed a weak antidot peak only at @xmath40 @xmath14(@xmath41 nm ) . to be in the classical limit of a quantum system , </S>",
    "<S> the fermi wavelength must satisfy a condition @xmath42 @xcite , where @xmath43 is a typical dimension of the system . in our case </S>",
    "<S> , the neck width @xmath19 of the constriction between the antidots is the shortest length scale in the problem , and we find that when @xmath44 the classical regime sets in and the antidot peak becomes visible .    </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the antidot peaks disappear at low densities can be either due to a limited mean free path or the breakdown of the classical picture . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2d ( lattice period @xmath10 </S>",
    "<S> nm ) all the antidot peaks disappear at roughly the same magnetic field , @xmath45 t </S>",
    "<S> ( where @xmath46 exceeds some constant ) , but different carrier density . </S>",
    "<S> this behaviour is clearly governed by a limited mean free path . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in the sample of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4a ( @xmath23 nm ) , we find that the classical features at both @xmath47 t and @xmath48 t disappear at the same carrier densities , making a @xmath2-driven scenario more realistic .    finally , at low densities , we can observe a weak localization ( wl ) feature at low temperatures : a peak in the magnetoresistance at @xmath11 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4b ) . using a standard analysis for wl in graphene @xcite that we employed in earlier work on graphene antidot lattices on sio@xmath0 @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we extracted the phase coherence length @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> for the sample with @xmath23 nm ( same as in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3a ) we found it to be between 120 nm and 300 nm ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4c ) . </S>",
    "<S> it clearly exceeds the lattice period , unlike in graphene antidot samples on sio@xmath0 where @xmath49 was significantly below @xmath7 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore again conclude that nanopatterning of embedded graphene leads to greatly reduced scattering at the sample edges .    </S>",
    "<S> in summary , we prepared antidot lattices in stacks of hbn / graphene / hbn and observed well - developed commensurability features in samples with lattice periods from @xmath1 nm to @xmath50 nm . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that the etching procedure preserves the high sample quality . in the short - period graphene samples </S>",
    "<S> , we could observe the disappearance of classical features when the fermi wavelength @xmath2 exceeds @xmath19 , marking a classical to quantum transition . </S>",
    "<S> our experiments therefore pave the way for well - controlled graphene based nanodevices . </S>"
