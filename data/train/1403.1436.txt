    "nowadays , the study of the geometry of the space of all immersions of a certain type  including plane curves , space curves and surfaces  is an active area of research with applications in computational anatomy , shape comparison and image analysis , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "this space , denoted by @xmath1 , consists of smooth immersions from a compact @xmath8-dimensional manifold @xmath2 into a @xmath9-dimensional riemannian manifold @xmath3 of bounded geometry .",
    "the important special case of planar curves corresponds to @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "we will always assume that @xmath12 , in which case @xmath1 is a smooth frchet manifold @xcite ; otherwise it is empty .",
    "the notion of shape space in this article is that of unparametrized immersions .",
    "this space can be identified with the quotient space @xmath13 here , @xmath14 denotes the lie group of all smooth diffeomorphisms on @xmath2 , which acts smoothly on @xmath1 via composition from the right : @xmath15 the quotient space @xmath16 is not a manifold , but only an orbifold with isolated singularities ( see @xcite for more information ) .    given a reparametrization invariant metric @xmath0 on @xmath1 , we can ( under certain conditions )",
    "induce a unique riemannian metric on the quotient space @xmath16 such that the projection @xmath17 is a riemannian submersion . a detailed description of this construction is provided in ( * ?",
    "* section  4 ) . for many metrics",
    ", @xmath18 induces a splitting of the tangent bundle @xmath19 into a vertical bundle , which is defined as the kernel of @xmath18 , and a horizontal bundle , defined as the @xmath0-orthogonal complement of the vertical bundle : @xmath20 if one can lift any curve in @xmath16 to a horizontal curve in @xmath1 , then there is a one - to - one correspondence between geodesics on shape space @xmath16 and horizontal geodesics on @xmath1 ( * ? ? ? * section  4.8 ) .",
    "this constitutes an effective way to compute geodesics on shape space provided that the horizontal bundle is not too complicated .",
    "a particularly favorable case is when the splitting in equation coincides with the natural splitting into components that are tangential and normal to the immersed surface with respect to the metric @xmath6 : @xmath21 if @xmath22 denotes the projection of a tangent vector onto its foot point , the above bundles are given by @xmath23    one specific example of a metric for which the splittings in equations and coincide is the @xmath24 metric , which is also the simplest and in a way most natural metric on @xmath1 .",
    "it is defined as @xmath25 here , @xmath26 are tangent vectors at @xmath27 , @xmath28 denotes the pullback of the metric @xmath6 along the immersion @xmath5 and @xmath29 denotes the associated volume form on @xmath2 .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath24-metric is unsuited for many applications because the induced geodesic distance on @xmath16 and @xmath1 vanishes .",
    "indeed , any two immersions @xmath30 can be connected by paths of arbitrarily short @xmath31-length @xcite .",
    "the discovery of the degeneracy of the @xmath24-metric started a quest for stronger and more meaningful metrics .",
    "one particular class of metrics that has been introduced are almost local metrics @xcite , which are defined as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a smooth , reparametrization invariant function .",
    "almost local metrics enjoy the same simple splitting into horizontal and vertical subbundles as the @xmath24-metric , but overcome its degeneracy to some extent . on the positive side ,",
    "they induce non - vanishing geodesic distance on @xmath16",
    ". however , on the negative side , the geodesic distance vanishes along @xmath14-fibers .",
    "moreover , well - posedness of the geodesic equation , existence of conjugated points and boundedness of the curvature tensor remain unknown for these metrics .",
    "another approach to strengthen the @xmath24-metric are sobolev metrics , which have been studied in a variety of different articles , including @xcite .",
    "they are defined as @xmath34 where for each @xmath35 , the operator @xmath36 is an elliptic pseudo - differential operator of order @xmath37 , which is symmetric and positive with respect to the @xmath24-metric .",
    "almost local metrics are included in this definition .",
    "the standard sobolev metric of order @xmath9 is @xmath38 where the laplacian depends on the immersion @xmath5 via the pullback metric @xmath39 .    under certain assumptions on @xmath40 , well - posedness of the corresponding geodesic equation",
    "has been shown @xcite . from a computational point of view @xcite , metrics involving a pseudo - differential operator have the severe disadvantage that the splitting into horizontal and vertical parts is rather complicated : a tangent vector @xmath41 is horizontal if and only if @xmath42 is @xmath6-normal to the surface @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , calculating the horizontal component of @xmath41 involves inverting the operator @xmath36 ( or , to be precise , the restriction and projection of the operator @xmath36 to the space @xmath43 , cf .",
    "lemma [ lem : splitting ] ) .",
    "if , on the other hand , the splittings and coincide , then projecting @xmath41 onto its horizontal part is easy : one simple takes the normal component of @xmath41 .",
    "an immediate application is that one can solve the boundary value problem for geodesics on shape space efficiently by minimizing the horizontal energy of paths in the space of immersions .",
    "this approach has been used in @xcite to calculate geodesics on the spaces @xmath44 and @xmath45 under various almost local metrics . however",
    ", this approach must be expected to work well for any metric where it is easy to calculate horizontal projections , e.g. , for the class of metrics presented here .",
    "our main result is the classification of all sobolev metrics such that the splitting into horizontal and vertical components coincides with the natural splitting into tangential and normal components .",
    "this classification is established for immersions of general manifolds @xmath2 and @xmath46 .",
    "the special case of planar curves ( @xmath10 and @xmath47 ) is investigated in more detail .",
    "there , it is shown that the class of metrics where horizontality equals normality is rich enough to include metrics which dominate any given standard sobolev metric . using a result of @xcite",
    ", it is shown that this makes it possible to control the regularity of curves in the metric completion of shape space .",
    "this is important for applications ( e.g. , stochastics on shape space ) where going to the metric completion is indispensable .    finally , we present some numerical solutions of the boundary value problem for geodesics on shape space for selected metrics satisfying the assumptions of our main theorem .",
    "our numerical scheme strongly builds on the simplicity of the horizontal bundle asserted by this theorem .",
    "we are thankful to martins bruveris for helpful remarks .",
    "following @xcite , we now rigorously define the class of metrics that we study in this article .",
    "we assume that @xmath40 is a smooth bundle automorphism of @xmath19 such that at every @xmath27 , the operator @xmath48 is a pseudo differential operator of order @xmath37 , which is symmetric and positive with respect to the @xmath24-metric on @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , we assume that @xmath40 is invariant under the action of the reparametrization group @xmath14 acting on @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath49 these assumptions will remain in place throughout this work .",
    "their immediate use is as follows : being symmetric and positive , @xmath40 induces a sobolev type metric on the manifold of immersions through equation .",
    "the @xmath14-invariance of @xmath40 implies the @xmath14-invariance of the metric @xmath50 . assuming that the decomposition in horizontal and vertical bundles exists , there is a unique metric on @xmath16 , such that the projection is a riemannian submersion , see ( *",
    ". then the resulting geometry of shape space is mirrored by the `` horizontal geometry '' on the manifold of immersions .",
    "it follows from the definitions that the horizontal and vertical bundles are given by @xmath51 by the positivity of the metric @xmath50 , the sum @xmath52 is always direct , but it might not span the entire tangent space @xmath4 . in other words , in our infinite dimensional setting , a complement to the vertical bundle might only exist in some completion of the space . in this section , we present sufficient conditions for the existence of a splitting of the tangent space into horizontal and vertical subbundles .",
    "in contrast to above , the splitting into tangential and normal parts given in equation always exists .",
    "let @xmath53 be the components of a tangent vector @xmath41 corresponding to this splitting and let @xmath54 be projections and restrictions of @xmath40 to the corresponding subbundles .",
    "these operators allow us to formulate a sufficient condition for the existence of a horizontal / vertical splitting .",
    "[ lem : splitting ] if the operator @xmath55 is invertible , then a splitting into horizontal and vertical parts exists and the corresponding projections are @xmath56    it is straight - forward to check that @xmath57 and that these vectors add up to @xmath41 , c.f . @xcite .",
    "the condition of lemma  [ lem : splitting ] is satisfied in many cases , as the following lemma shows .",
    "[ lem : elliptic ] if the operator @xmath36 is elliptic , then all of the operators @xmath58 are elliptic and invertible .",
    "we show the statement for the operator @xmath55 .",
    "let @xmath59 and @xmath60 be the principal symbols of @xmath36 and @xmath61 .",
    "then , for any @xmath62 and @xmath63 , one has @xmath64 for any @xmath65 the mapping @xmath66 is symmetric and positive definite with respect to @xmath6 because @xmath36 is elliptic .",
    "the relation @xmath67 shows that @xmath68 is also symmetric and positive definite .",
    "therefore , @xmath55 is elliptic .",
    "moreover , it inherits symmetry and positivity with respect to the scalar product @xmath69 from @xmath36 : @xmath70 for any @xmath71 , let @xmath72 be the @xmath73-th order sobolev completion of @xmath74 . since @xmath55 is elliptic and symmetric , it is self - adjoint on @xmath72 and its index as an operator @xmath75 vanishes .",
    "it is injective ( since positive ) with vanishing index ( since self - adjoint elliptic , by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 26.2 ) ) , hence it is bijective and thus invertible by the open mapping theorem .",
    "the inverse @xmath76 restricts to a continuous linear mapping on the frchet space @xmath74 .",
    "ellipticity , symmetry , positivity and invertibility of @xmath77 and @xmath36 are shown in a similar way .",
    "the vertical and tangential bundles are always the same by definition ( c.f . lemma [ lem : splitting ] ) .",
    "therefore , horizontality equals normality if and only if the horizontal / vertical splitting coincides with the normal / tangential splitting , which is the property we are interested in .    [ thm : decomposition ] the following two statements are equivalent :    * the splitting exists and coincides with . *",
    "the operator @xmath40 has a decomposition @xmath78 into operators @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "assume ( a ) , i.e. , that the horizontal and normal bundles coincide .",
    "then , by definition , @xmath40 maps normal into normal vectors . to see that it also maps tangential into tangential vectors ,",
    "take a tangential vector @xmath41 and test @xmath81 against arbitrary normal vectors @xmath82 : @xmath83 for all normal vectors @xmath82 , because @xmath40 is symmetric and @xmath84 is normal .",
    "this shows that @xmath81 is tangential . to summarize",
    ", we have shown that the normal and tangential bundle are invariant subspaces of @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , ( b ) holds .",
    "conversely , assume ( b ) .",
    "then , by definition , every normal vector is horizontal . to see that every horizontal vector is normal ,",
    "take a horizontal vector @xmath41 and split it into its normal and tangential components @xmath85 . by the horizontality of @xmath41 ,",
    "@xmath81 is normal , which means that @xmath86 .",
    "then also @xmath87 which implies @xmath88 by the non - degeneracy of the metric .",
    "therefore , @xmath41 is normal .",
    "if @xmath78 decomposes as in theorem  [ thm : decomposition ] , then the metric induced by @xmath50 on shape space depends on @xmath89 , but not on @xmath90 . consequently , the geodesic equation on shape space and the horizontal geodesic equation on @xmath1 should also have this property .",

    "@xmath95 , this was done in ( * ? ? ? * section 8) .",
    "[ lem : horizontal_geodesic ] let @xmath78 as in theorem [ thm : decomposition ] .",
    "then the horizontal geodesic equation does not depend on @xmath90 .",
    "note that in equation , @xmath96 can be replaced by @xmath97 .",
    "thus , it is sufficient to show that the expression @xmath98 on the right hand side of the geodesic equation vanishes , if @xmath40 is of the form @xmath99 , which we assume now .",
    "let @xmath100 be vector fields on @xmath1 taking values in the normal bundle .",
    "then @xmath101 which shows that @xmath102 since these expressions are tensorial in @xmath100 and @xmath103 is normal , one obtains @xmath104 since also @xmath105 , all terms in vanish .",
    "the above lemma shows that the horizontal geodesic equation is well - defined under the following conditions on @xmath89 : the operator @xmath77 is invertible and @xmath106 restricted to and projected onto the normal bundle has a normal bundle valued adjoint .",
    "note that it is not necessary to impose any conditions on @xmath90 , here .",
    "in the previous section , we characterized all metrics such that the horizontal and normal bundles coincide . in practice , there are many additional properties that a metric should satisfy to be useful . for example , the induced geodesic distance should not vanish , one would like to be able to control the regularity of immersions in the metric completion , and the space should be geodesically complete .",
    "we show in this section that it is indeed possible to meet at least some of these objectives simultaneously .",
    "we do this in the important special case of planar curves , but we believe that similar results can be obtained for arbitrary immersions . however , as of now , metric and geodesic completeness remain unknown in the more general situation , even for standard sobolev metrics .    in the case of planar curves ,",
    "the decomposition of tangent vectors @xmath107 into tangential and normal components takes the particularly simple form @xmath108 here , @xmath109 and @xmath110 denote the euclidean scalar product and norm on @xmath111 and @xmath112 denotes the counter - clockwise rotation by the angle @xmath113 .",
    "this allows us to derive a very simple sufficient condition for the equality of the horizontal and normal bundle .",
    "[ lem : sufficient ] any metric of the form @xmath114 with coefficients @xmath115 has the property that the horizontal and normal bundles coincide .    using integration by parts , the metric in can be rewritten in the form involving an operator @xmath40 , which is given by @xmath116 clearly , @xmath117 and @xmath118 are invariant subspaces of @xmath119 .",
    "the result follows from theorem  [ thm : decomposition ] .    using lemma  [ lem : sufficient ]",
    ", we can easily construct a metric which is stronger than the sobolev metric of order one and where horizontality equals normality .",
    "[ lem : stronger_than_h1 ] the metric @xmath120 dominates the standard sobolev @xmath121 metric @xmath122 and has the property that the horizontal and normal bundles coincide .",
    "the metric in satisfies the condition of lemma [ lem : sufficient ] , which implies that the horizontal and normal bundles coincide .",
    "it remains to show that the metric dominates the @xmath121-metric .",
    "to this aim , let @xmath123 with @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "then @xmath126 therefore , @xmath127 by the arithmetic - geometric inequality , the estimates @xmath128 hold .",
    "regrouping terms , one obtains that @xmath129    the metric @xmath0 from lemma [ lem : stronger_than_h1 ] induces non - vanishing geodesic distance on both @xmath130 and @xmath1 , i.e. , the infimum of the @xmath0-lengths of paths connecting two non - identical planar curves is strictly greater than zero .",
    "furthermore , all curves in the metric completion of the space @xmath131 are lipschitz continous .",
    "these results follow directly from the corresponding results for the @xmath121 or @xmath132 metric .",

    "@xmath133 the problem is that the expression on the right hand side contains third derivatives of @xmath134 while @xmath40 is only of second order in @xmath41 .",
    "similar problems arise with higher order metrics and metrics on spaces of higher dimensional immersions .",
    "[ strongerthensob ] for any @xmath135 , there is a metric which dominates the sobolev @xmath136 metric @xmath137 and which has the property that the horizontal and normal bundles coincide .",
    "the statement for @xmath138 is trivial . for @xmath139",
    ", it has been shown in lemma [ lem : stronger_than_h1 ] .",
    "for @xmath140 , it remains to bound the highest order term .",
    "an application of jensen s inequality yields the estimate @xmath141 letting @xmath123 and taking in account also the zero and first order terms , c.f .",
    "lemma [ lem : stronger_than_h1 ] , one obtains @xmath142 the expression on the right - hand side defines a metric , which is of the form required in lemma [ lem : sufficient ] .",
    "therefore , the horizontal bundle equals the normal bundle for this metric . by construction",
    ", it dominates the @xmath143 metric . for higher order metrics ,",
    "the proof is similar .    since we have shown that it is possible to construct arbitrarily strong metrics for which horizontality equals normality , we are able to control the regularity of curves in the metric completion .",
    "let @xmath0 be a metric which is stronger than the @xmath136 metric .",
    "then the metric completion of the space @xmath144 is contained in the set @xmath145 of all @xmath136 immersions .",
    "every cauchy sequence with respect to the metric @xmath0 is also a cauchy sequence with respect to the weaker metric @xmath136 . by theorem [ thm :",
    "completeness ] , the sequence has a limit in the space @xmath146 .",
    "therefore , the completion of @xmath144 can be seen as a subset of @xmath146 .",
    "see also @xcite for the metric completion of a length - weighted sobolev @xmath143-metric .",
    "in this section , we demonstrate that the boundary value problem for geodesics on shape space can be solved efficiently for metrics satisfying the assumptions of theorem [ thm : decomposition ] . in particular , we are able to treat higher order metrics without much effort .",
    "we present several examples of ( discrete ) solutions of the boundary value problem for geodesics of planar curves , i.e. , we are searching for a geodesic @xmath147 connecting two given boundary curves @xmath148 .",
    "we tackle this problem by minimizing the horizontal path energy @xmath149 over the set of paths in @xmath150 with fixed endpoints . here , @xmath151 denotes the time derivative @xmath152 of the path .",
    "the horizontal component @xmath153 is easy to calculate whenever the metric satisfies the conditions of theorem [ thm : decomposition ] .",
    "note that the energy functional does not depend on the parametrization of the curve at each instant of time .",
    "so we are free to choose a suitable parametrization .",
    "we do this by adding to the energy functional a term penalizing irregular parametrizations .",
    "so instead of minimizing the horizontal path energy , we minimize the sum of horizontal path energy and a penalty term , which measures the deviation from constant speed parametrization .",
    "in our numerical experiments , we consider four different metrics of order zero , one and two , to be described below .",
    "all of them satisfy the conditions of theorem [ thm : decomposition ] . for horizontal tangent vectors",
    "@xmath154 they are given by :    * metric 1 ( @xmath132-metric with @xmath155 ) : @xmath156 * metric 2 ( @xmath121-type metric ) : @xmath157 * metric 3 : @xmath158 * metric 4 ( @xmath143-type metric ) : @xmath159    the motivation for metrics 2 and 4 lies in theorem [ strongerthensob ] : metric 2 dominates the @xmath121-metric and metric 4 dominates the @xmath143-metric .",
    "metric 1 ( the @xmath132-metric ) has been introduced by michor and mumford @xcite to overcome the degeneracy of the @xmath24-metric .",
    "this metric involves all terms of the @xmath121-metric which do not differentiate the tangent vector , but only the foot point , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "metric 3 has a similar property : it consists of all terms of the @xmath143-metric which do not differentiate the tangent vector .      to obtain approximate solutions of the infinite dimensional problem ,",
    "we discretize the space of curves and the energy functional .",
    "we follow the same maxims as @xcite .",
    "curves are replaced by polygons with a fixed number of vertices . according to the principles of discrete differential geometry ,",
    "geometric quantities are defined on their natural domain ( edges , vertices , triangles , etc . ) and are assigned weights corresponding to their domain .",
    "when necessary , domains are split into sub - domains and the weights are adjusted accordingly .",
    "this ensures that the integrals in the definition of the horizontal energy functional are evaluated properly .",
    "for example , the discrete curvature @xmath160 is defined via the turning angle between two adjacent edges .",
    "its domain consists of the two adjacent half - edges and the corresponding weight is the total length of the half - edges . as a further example , the normal vector is defined on the edges of the curve , whereas @xmath151 is defined on vertices .",
    "thus , to define the function @xmath161 , the domains have to be split : the function @xmath162 is defined on triangles spanned by a vector @xmath151 ( obtained by either forward or backward differences ) and a neighboring edge of the curve ( again obtained by either forward or backward differences ) .",
    "note that around each vertex , there are four such triangles . to calculate spatial derivatives of @xmath162",
    ", one needs to define the `` distance '' between adjacent triangles .",
    "if the triangles share a common edge , then the distance is defined as half of the edge length .",
    "if they share a common vertex , it is defined as half of the weight assigned to the vertex .",
    "now one can define discrete versions of @xmath163 and @xmath164 by taking first and second order finite differences , respectively .    to avoid artifacts during the optimization procedure , the energy functional",
    "is written as sums of squares instead of squares of sums , whenever possible .",
    "this can be achieved by splitting domains into sub - domains as explained above .",
    "the details of our implementation can be seen from the ampl source code listed in appendix b.      as in @xcite , we use the nonlinear solver ipopt ( interior point optimizer @xcite ) in combination with ampl ( a modeling language for mathematical programming @xcite ) .",
    "ipopt applies a filter based line search method to compute the minimum of the discretized horizontal energy functional . in this process",
    ", it needs the gradient and the hessian of the energy , which is automatically and symbolically calculated by ampl .",
    "the full ampl - code needed to reproduce our results is printed in appendix [ ampl ] .",
    "numerics for first order metrics on the shape space of planar curves ( and , in particular , the elastic metric ) are well developed @xcite .",
    "a recurrent issue with these metrics is that singularities can form along geodesics .",
    "this leads to severe problems , including a - symmetry of the numerically calculated geodesic distance function @xcite .",
    "it is a natural question if these problems can be alleviated by using higher order metrics .",
    "this is indeed the case in our numerical experiments , where we compare a first order metric ( metric 2 ) to a second order one ( metric 4 ) .",
    "an example is presented in figure [ fig : cat2cow ] showing a geodesic connecting the silhouettes of a cat and a cow .",
    "for the first order metric , one can clearly observe the appearance of singularities ( kinks ) along the geodesic path .",
    "such singularities did not occur for the higher order metric ( metric 4 ) . in the case of simpler deformations ,",
    "both metrics perform well ( cf . figure [ fig : circle2star ] ) .",
    "high - frequency variations of shapes are felt more strongly by higher order metrics .",
    "thus , one might guess that these metrics do a better job at preserving the fine structure of a shape along a deformation affecting predominantly its coarse structure .",
    "such an effect can be observed in figure [ fig : move ] showing geodesics between two distinct shapes under all four metrics .",
    "another observation is that geodesics between shapes lying far apart in the plane tend to pass through one and the same shape , which ( depending on the metric ) might resemble an ellipse or a cigar .",
    "this phenomenon , which might be connected to regions of negative curvature in shape space , has first been observed for the @xmath132-metric in @xcite and for almost local metrics in @xcite .",
    "here , we show that the same effect also occurs for second order metrics , albeit only at higher distances of the shapes ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : move_long ] ) .",
    "we characterized all metrics on spaces of immersions such that the horizontal / vertical splitting coincides with the normal / tangential one ( theorem [ thm : decomposition ] ) .",
    "the first splitting can be easily calculated numerically , while the second splitting is important both theoretically and in applications because it mirrors the geometry of shape space and geodesics thereon .    to show that the condition that horizontality equals normality is not too stringent",
    ", we studied the special case of planar curves in more detail .",
    "we proved in this case that , for any sobolev metric of given order , there is a stronger metric with the property that horizontality equals normality . by a result of @xcite",
    ", this implies that the regularity of curves in the metric completion can be controlled .",
    "therefore , our class of metrics is rich enough for applications ( e.g. , stochastics on shape space ) where working with the metric completion is indispensable",
    ".    finally , we demonstrated in numerical examples that the boundary value problem for geodesics on shape space can be solved efficiently for these metrics .",
    "on the manifold of planar curves , one can define a reparametrization invariant sobolev metric by @xmath165 recently , it has been shown in @xcite that the @xmath136 metric is geodesically complete for @xmath166 .",
    "since the hopf - rinow theorem does not hold in infinite dimensions @xcite , this does not automatically imply metric completeness .",
    "instead , we have the following result :    [ thm : completeness ] for @xmath166 , the metric completion of the space of smooth immersed curves endowed with the @xmath136 metric is the space of all @xmath136 immersions @xmath167    note that @xmath168 is a strong riemannian metric on the hilbert manifold @xmath145 .",
    "thus , the topology on @xmath145 induced by the geodesic distance of the metric @xmath168 is equal to the standard topology on @xmath169 .",

    "<S> the tangent space @xmath4 at each immersion @xmath5 has two natural splittings : one into components that are tangential / normal to the surface @xmath5 ( with respect to @xmath6 ) and another one into vertical / horizontal components ( with respect to the projection onto the shape space @xmath7 of unparametrized immersions and with respect to the metric @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the first splitting can be easily calculated numerically , while the second splitting is important because it mirrors the geometry of shape space and geodesics thereon . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by facilitating the numerical calculation of geodesics on shape space , we characterize all metrics @xmath0 such that the two splittings coincide . in the special case of planar curves , we show that the regularity of curves in the metric completion can be controlled by choosing a strong enough metric within this class . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate in several examples that our approach allows us to efficiently calculate numerical solutions of the boundary value problem for geodesics on shape space . </S>"
