    "the orbits of more than 70,000 main - belt asteroids , 1000 near - earth objects ( neos ) , 670 trans - neptunian objects ( tnos ) , and 1000 comets are known .",
    "most of the small bodies are located in the main asteroid and trans - neptunian ( edgeworth - kuiper ) belts and in the oort cloud .",
    "these belts and the cloud are considered to be the main sources of the objects that could collide with the earth .",
    "about 0.4% of the encounters within 0.2 au of the earth are from periodic comets ( http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/lists/closeapp.html ) , and 6 out of 20 recent approaches of comets with the earth within 0.102 au were due to periodic comets ( http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/lists/closestcomets.html ) .",
    "so the fraction of close encounters with the earth due to active comets is @xmath01% .",
    "reviews of the asteroid and comet hazard were given in [ 1]-[3 ] .",
    "many scientists [ 3]-[5 ] believe that asteroids are the main source of neos ( i.e. objects with perihelion distance @xmath4@xmath21.3 au ) .",
    "bottke et al .",
    "[ 3 ] considered that there are 200@xmath5140 km - sized jupiter - family comets at @xmath4@xmath21.3 au , with @xmath080% of them being extinct comets .",
    "duncan et al .",
    "[ 6 ] and kuchner [ 7 ] investigated the migration of tnos to neptune s orbit , and levison and duncan [ 8 ] studied the migration from neptune s orbit to jupiter s orbit .",
    "ipatov and hahn [ 9 ] considered the migration of 48 jupiter - crossing objects ( jcos ) with initial orbits close to the orbit of comet p/1996 r2 and found that on average such objects spend @xmath0 5000 yr in orbits which cross both the orbits of jupiter and earth .",
    "using these results and additional orbit integrations , and assuming that there are @xmath6 1-km tnos with 30@xmath2@xmath1@xmath250 au [ 10 ] , ipatov [ 1],[2],[11 ] found that about @xmath7 1-km former tnos are",
    "jupiter - crossers now and 10 - 20% or more 1-km earth - crossers could have come from the edgeworth - kuiper belt into jupiter - crossing orbits .",
    "note that previous estimates of the number of bodies with diameter @xmath8@xmath9@xmath10 km and 30@xmath11@xmath12@xmath1350 au were larger : @xmath14 [ 12 ] and @xmath15 [ 13 ] in the present paper we use the estimates from [ 2 ] , but now include a much larger number of jcos .",
    "preliminary results were presented by ipatov [ 14]-[16 ] , who also discussed the formation of tnos and asteroids , and in [ 17 ] .",

    "as the actual collisions of migrating objects with terrestrial planets are rare , we use an approximation of random phases and orientations to estimate probabilities of collision for families of objects with similar orbital elements .",
    "we suppose that their semi - major axes @xmath1 , eccentricities @xmath26 and inclinations @xmath27 are fixed , but the orientations of the orbits can vary .",
    "when a minor body collides with a planet at a distance @xmath28 from the sun , the characteristic time to collide , @xmath29 , is a factor of @xmath30 times that computed with an approximation of constant velocity , where @xmath31 is the velocity at the point where the orbit of the body crosses the orbit of the planet , and @xmath32 is the velocity for the same semi - major axis and a circular orbit .",
    "this coefficient @xmath33 modifies the formulas obtained by ipatov [ 1],[18 ] for characteristic collision and close encounter times of two objects moving around the sun in crossing orbits .",
    "these formulas also depend on the synodic period and improve on pik s formulas when the semi - major axes of the objects are close to each other . as an example , at @xmath26=0.7 and @xmath1=3.06 au , we have @xmath33=2.26 .    based on these formulas , we calculated probabilities ( 1/@xmath29 ) for @xmath0 1300 neos , including 343 venus - crossers , 756 earth - crossers and 1197 mars - crossers .",
    "the values of @xmath29 ( in myr ) , @xmath33 , and the number @xmath34 of objects considered are presented in table 1 .",
    "we considered separately the atens , apollos , amors , and several jupiter - family comets ( jfcs ) .",
    "the relatively small values of @xmath29 for atens and for all neos colliding with the earth are due to several atens with small inclinations discovered during the last three years .",
    "if we increase the inclination of the aten object 2000 sg344 from @xmath27=@xmath35 to @xmath27=@xmath36 , then for collisions with the earth we find @xmath37=28 myr and @xmath33=0.84 for atens and @xmath37=97 myr and @xmath33=1.09 for neos .",
    "these times are much longer , and illustrate the importance of rare objects .",
    ".semi - major axes ( in au ) , eccentricities and inclinations of considered comets [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as the migration of tnos to jupiter s orbit was investigated by several authors , we have made a series of simulations of the orbital evolution of jcos under the gravitational influence of planets .",
    "we omitted the influence of mercury ( except for comet 2p ) and pluto .",
    "the orbital evolution of about 9352 and 10301 jcos with initial periods @xmath38@xmath220 yr was integrated with the use of the bulirsh - stoer ( bulsto code [ 19 ] ) and symplectic ( rmvs3 code ) methods , respectively .",
    "we used the integration package of levison and duncan [ 20 ] . in the first series of runs ( denoted as @xmath39 ) we calculated the evolution of 3100 jcos moving in initial orbits close to those of 20 real comets with period @xmath40@xmath2@xmath38@xmath29 yr , and in the second series of runs ( denoted as @xmath41 ) we considered 7250 jcos moving in initial orbits close to those of 10 real comets ( with numbers 77 , 81 , 82 , 88 , 90 , 94 , 96 , 97 , 110 , 113 ) with period 5@xmath2@xmath38@xmath215 yr . in other series of runs , initial orbits were close to those of a single comet ( 2p , 9p , 10p , 22p , 28p , 39p , and 44p ) . in order to compare the orbital evolution of comets and asteroids",
    ", we also investigated the orbital evolution of asteroids initially moving in the 3:1 and 5:2 resonances with jupiter .",
    "the number of objects in one run usually was @xmath11250 .    in most jco cases",
    "the time @xmath42 when perihelion was passed was varied with a step @xmath43@xmath111 day ( i.e. , @xmath44 was varied with a step @xmath2@xmath45 ) . near the @xmath42",
    "estimated from observations , we used smaller steps . in",
    "most jco cases the range of initial values of @xmath42 was less than several tens of days . for asteroids , we varied initial values of @xmath44 and the longitude of the ascending node from 0 to 360@xmath46 .",
    "the approximate values of initial orbital elements ( @xmath1 in au , @xmath27 in deg ) are presented in table 2 .",
    "we initially integrated the orbits for @xmath47@xmath910 myr .",
    "after 10 myr we tested whether some of remaining objects could reach inside jupiter s orbit ; if so , the calculations were usually continued .",
    "therefore the results for orbits crossing or inside jupiter s orbit were the same as if the integrations had been carried to the entire lifetimes of the objects . for comet 2p and resonant asteroids , we integrated until all objects were ejected into hyperbolic orbits or collided with the sun . in some previous publications",
    "we have used smaller @xmath47 , so these new data are more accurate .    in our runs , planets were considered as material points so literal collisions did not occur . however , using the formulas of the previous section , and the orbital elements sampled with a 500 yr step , we calculated the mean probability @xmath48 of collisions .",
    "we define @xmath48 as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the probability for all @xmath51 objects of a collision of an object with a planet during its lifetime , the mean time @xmath37=@xmath52 during which perihelion distance @xmath4 of an object was less than the semi - major axis @xmath53 of the planet , the mean time @xmath54 ( in kyr ) spent in orbits with @xmath3@xmath24.2 au , and the mean time @xmath55 during which an object moved in jupiter - crossing orbits .",

    "this is a little more than @xmath180 for our @xmath39 runs , but less than for @xmath41 runs . for our former resonant asteroids , @xmath55 is relatively large ( @xmath1320.2 myr ) , and such asteroids can reach cometary orbits .",
    "comets are estimated to be active for @xmath181@xmath0@xmath182@xmath7 yr .",
    "@xmath181 is smaller for closer encounters with the sun [ 5 ] , so for comet 2p it is smaller than for other jfcs .",
    "some former comets can move for tens or even hundreds of myr in neo orbits , so the number of extinct comets can exceed the number of active comets by several orders of magnitude .",
    "the mean time spent by encke - type objects in earth - crossing orbits is @xmath90.4 myr ( even for @xmath149 ) .",
    "this time corresponds to @xmath940 - 400 extinct comets of this type .",
    "note that the diameter of comet 2p is about 5 - 10 km , so the number of smaller extinct comets can be much larger .",
    "the above estimates of the number of neos are approximate .",
    "for example , it is possible that the number of 1-km tnos is several times smaller than @xmath6 , while some scientists estimated that this number can be up to @xmath15 [ 13 ] .",
    "also , the fraction of tnos that have migrated towards the earth might be smaller .",
    "on the other hand , the above number of tnos was estimated for @xmath1 @xmath2 50 au , and tnos from more distant regions can also migrate inward .",
    "probably , the oort cloud could also supply jupiter - family comets . according to asher et al .",
    "[ 26 ] , the rate of a cometary object decoupling from the jupiter vicinity and transferring to an neo - like orbit is increased by a factor of 4 or 5 due to nongravitational effects ( see also [ 27 ] ) .",
    "this would result in larger values of @xmath56 and @xmath37 than those shown in table 3 .",
    "our estimates show that , in principle , the trans - neptunian belt can provide a significant portion of the earth - crossing objects , although many neos clearly came from the main asteroid belt .",
    "many former jupiter - family comets can have orbits typical of asteroids , and collide with the earth from typical neo orbits .",
    "it may be possible to explore former tnos near the earth s orbit without sending spacecraft to the trans - neptunian region .",
    "based on the estimated collision probability @xmath183 we find that 1-km former tnos now collide with the earth once in 3 myr .",
    "this value of @xmath48 is smaller than that for our @xmath39 , and especially than for @xmath41 , 10p and 2p runs . assuming the total mass of planetesimals that ever crossed jupiter s orbit is @xmath0@xmath184 , where @xmath185 is the mass of the earth [ 1],[28 ] , we conclude that the total mass of bodies that impacted the earth is @xmath186 .",
    "if ices comprised only half of this mass , then the total mass of ices @xmath187 that were delivered to the earth from the feeding zone of the giant planets is about the mass of the terrestrial oceans ( @xmath188 ) .",
    "the calculated probabilities of collisions of objects with planets show that the fraction of the mass of the planet delivered by short - period comets can be greater for mars and venus than for the earth ( table 3 ) .",
    "this larger mass fraction would result in relatively large ancient oceans on mars and venus . on the other hand , there is the deuterium / hydrogen paradox of earth s oceans , as the d / h ratio is different for oceans and comets .",
    "pavlov et al . [ 29 ] suggested that solar wind - implanted hydrogen on interplanetary dust particles could provide the necessary low - d / h component of earth s water inventory , and delsemme [ 30 ] considered that most of the seawater was brought by the comets that originated in jupiter s zone , where steam from the inner solar system condensed onto icy interstellar grains before they accreted into larger bodies .",
    "our estimate of the migration of water to the early earth is in accordance with [ 31 ] , but is greater than those of morbidelli et al .",
    "[ 32 ] and levison et al .",
    "the latter obtained smaller values of @xmath187 , and we suspect that this is because they did not take into account the migration of bodies into orbits with @xmath3@xmath24.5 au .",
    "perhaps this was because they modeled a relatively small number of objects , and levison et al .",
    "[ 33 ] did not take into account the influence of the terrestrial planets . in",
    "our runs the probability of a collision of a single object with a terrestrial planet could be much greater than the total probability of thousands of other objects , so the statistics are dominated by rare occurrences that might not appear in smaller simulations .",
    "the mean probabilities of collisions can differ by orders of magnitude for different jcos .",
    "other scientists considered other initial objects and smaller numbers of jupiter - crossing objects , and did not find decoupling from jupiter , which is a rare event .",
    "we believe there is no contradiction between our present results and the smaller migration of former jcos to the near - earth space that was obtained in earlier work , including our own papers ( e.g. [ 9 ] ) , where we used the same integration package .    from measured albedos , fernandez et al .",
    "[ 34 ] concluded that the fraction of extinct comets among neos and unusual asteroids is significant ( at least 9% are candidates ) .",
    "the idea that there may be many extinct comets among neos was considered by several scientists .",
    "rickman et al . [ 35 ] believed that comets played an important and perhaps even dominant role among all km - size earth impactors . in their opinion , dark spectral classes that might include the ex - comets are severely underrepresented",
    "( see also [ 10 ] ) .",
    "our runs showed that if one observes former comets in neo orbits , then it is probable that they have already moved in such orbits for millions ( or at least hundreds of thousands ) years , and only a few of them have been in such orbits for short times ( a few thousand years ) .",
    "some former comets that have moved in typical neo orbits for millions or even hundreds of millions of years , and might have had multiple close encounters with the sun ( some of these encounters can be very close to the sun , e.g. in the case of comet 2p at @xmath133@xmath590.05 myr ) , could have lost their mantles , which causes their low albedo , and so change their albedo ( for most observed neos , the albedo is greater than that for comets [ 34 ] ) and would look like typical asteroids or some of them could disintegrate into mini - comets .",
    "typical comets have larger rotation periods than typical neos [ 36]-[37 ] , but , while losing considerable portions of their masses , extinct comets can decrease these periods . for better estimates of the portion of extinct comets among neos we will need orbit integrations for many more tnos and jcos , and wider analysis of observations and craters .",
    "some jupiter - family comets can reach typical neo orbits and remain there for millions of years . while the probability of such events is small ( about @xmath00.1% ) , nevertheless the majority of collisions of former jcos with the terrestrial planets are due to such objects .",
    "most former tnos that have typical neo orbits moved in such orbits for millions of years ( if they did not disintegrate into mini - comets ) , so during most of this time there were extinct comets .",
    "from the dynamical point of view there could be many extinct comets among the neos .",
    "the amount of water delivered to the earth during planet formation could be about the mass of the earth oceans .",
