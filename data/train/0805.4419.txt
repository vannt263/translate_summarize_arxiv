    "for decades , it has been known that the star formation rate ( sfr ) in galaxies is intimately related to the gas reservoir from which stars are formed @xcite .",

    "recent studies have focused on dense molecular gas tracers ( e.g. , hcn  ( 1 - 0 ) , co  ( 3 - 2 ) ) and have found a tight , linear correlation between the sfr , traced by infrared ( ir ) luminosity ( @xmath11 ) , and the mass of dense gas , traced by molecular line luminosity ,  @xcite . the surface density relation and the sfr-  relation ( for dense gas tracers )",
    "appear to predict different behaviors for the underlying star formation law in galaxies .",
    "the linear relationship between  and hcn  ( 1 - 0 ) luminosity over three decades in  found by @xcite in local star forming galaxies has been interpreted as a constant star formation efficiency ( sfr / m@xmath12 ) traced by dense molecular gas .",
    "@xcite extended the observed linear relationship between  and hcn  ( 1 - 0 ) luminosity to galactic clumps , positing that if hcn  ( 1 - 0 ) emission faithfully traces dense molecular core mass ( above a cutoff luminosity of @xmath13 ) , then constant sfr per unit mass is a result of a dense molecular clump comprising a `` fundamental unit '' of star formation .",
    "the observed extragalactic linear correlation is a natural extension of the constant sfr per unit mass observed toward dense molecular clumps in the milky way @xcite . in this picture ,",
    "ultraluminous ir galaxies such as arp  220 which lie on the linear sfr - hcn  ( 1 - 0 ) relation simply contain more cluster forming units , and a higher fraction of dense molecular gas .",
    "the interpretation outlined in @xcite predicts a linear relation between sfr and tracers of even higher critical ( @xmath14 ) density than hcn  ( 1 - 0 ) .",
    "however , recent theoretical models from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter n07 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter kt07 ) predict that the power - law index between the sfr and higher critical density tracers such as hcn  ( 3 - 2 ) should in fact be below unity .",
    "the physical explanation for this behavior is that in systems with predominantly low density gas , emission from high critical density lines originates in the extreme tails of the density distribution resulting in a l@xmath15-@xmath16@xmath17@xmath18 relation with a slope greater than unity .",

    "for the sources marked in green triangles , we use the average  value of the two surveys ( measurements of the overlapping objects were in agreement to within 20% ) , but the  value as given in gc07 , since they use a more accurate prescription for computing the total ir luminosity .",
    "we note that a similar sample of nearby galaxies has been observed by @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , a direct comparison between their sample and ours is problematic because they employed a dual sideband receiver system and did not measure the sideband gain ratio , which can vary by a factor of two .",
    "we examined the integrated intensities of the seven galaxies appearing in both samples and found the values to be consistent within this factor of two .",
    "hcn  ( 3 - 2 ) luminosities have been published for the nuclear region of a set of nearby galaxies by @xcite .",
    "however , these observations were conducted with the iram 30 m telescope ( with a beam - size a factor of 3 smaller than the smt ) and therefore provide only lower limits to the full  emission . for the purposes of this paper ,",

    "using idl s svdfit , we find a slope of 0.79 using the full combined dataset .",
    "one of the objects in our sample ( ngc2146 ) lies significantly off the best fit relation , in the sense of either a lower  value or a greater @xmath11 . to explore the extent to which this affects the resultant best fit slope",
    ", we remove this object from the sample and re - compute the slope , finding a larger slope with a smaller dispersion : 0.84@xmath320.07 .",

    "one underlying assumption is that the hcn  ( 3 - 2 ) molecular line luminosity is linearly tracing the dense gas mass .",
    "this may not be valid when observing unresolved galaxies that include large quantities of sub - thermally excited gas .",
    "recent theoretical models from n07 and kt07 suggest that the index between the sfr and higher critical density tracers such as hcn  ( 3 - 2 ) should in fact be below unity .",
    "n07 used hydrodynamical simulations of isolated galaxies and equal - mass galaxy mergers coupled with a 3d non - local thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer code to probe the relationship of the dense molecular gas phase in galaxies with hcn and co emission across a variety of rotational transitions . meanwhile ,",
    "kt07 use escape probability radiative transfer simulations coupled with models of turbulence - regulated giant molecular clouds . while their work did not specifically explore the potential relations between sfr and higher critical density lines such as hcn  ( 3 - 2 ) , fundamentally their conclusion behind the physical driver of the @xmath11-  relation is similar to that of n07 , and thus similar results for higher lying transitions are expected .    according to n07 and kt07 ,",
    "the sfr - hcn  ( @xmath38-@xmath39 ) index is parameterized in terms of how the molecular line luminosity ,  is related to the mean molecular gas density , @xmath16@xmath17@xmath18 , of a given galaxy .",
    "if  grows as @xmath16@xmath17@xmath18 , the sfr-  relation will have an index of @xmath231.5 ( e.g. the observed @xmath11-@xmath40 index ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a -@xmath16@xmath17@xmath18 power - law index equal to the ks index produces a linear sfr - relationship . in this picture",
    ", the fundamental relationship is the volumetric version of the ks relation , and the observed linear sfr - hcn  ( 1 - 0 ) relationship in galaxies results from the hcn  ( 1 - 0 ) luminosity on average being related to the mean molecular gas density by an index similar to the ks index ( i.e. l@xmath23@xmath16@xmath17@xmath18@xmath41 ) .",
    "since  rises linearly with @xmath11 , hcn  ( 1 - 0 ) emission is a useful proxy for the total sfr , once the effects of agn have been properly taken into account .    alternatively , if the -@xmath16@xmath17@xmath18 power - law index is greater than the ks index , the sfr-  index will be below unity .",
    "physically , this can be understood as resulting from high critical density lines originating in extreme tails of the density distribution and causing a steepening of the @xmath42-@xmath16@xmath17@xmath18 power law index compared to lower critical density lines .",

    "figure  [ figure : slopes ] is a reproduction of figure  8 in n07 , but with new constraints our data  as well as the data from gc07place on the sfr - hcn power law index .",
    "the scatter in the predicted slope is represented by the horizontal grey lines and is computed by randomly drawing a sample of 19 galaxies ( which is the size of our combined dataset ) out of a set of 100 model galaxies 1000 times .",
    "the yellow shaded region shows the range of expected results from kt07 utilizing their publically available code with parameters appropriate for `` normal '' , `` intermediate '' , and `` starburst '' galaxies . in the kt model ,",
    "the sfr - hcn  ( 3 - 2 ) relation is predicted to have a slope below unity in the range 0.77 - 0.93 .",
