    "the existence of dark solitons ( ds ) is among the most spectacular manifestations of the role played by _ weak _",
    "inter - particle interactions in 1d cold atomic gases @xcite .",
    "such solitons are _ macroscopically _ large areas of partially , or even completely depleted gas , which propagate coherently without any dispersion .",
    "it is natural to interpret these objects as localized solutions of the _ semi - classical _ gross  pitaevskii equation @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , the means to create ds , employed so far , required a macroscopic classical perturbation applied to the atomic cloud .",
    "an example of the latter is the phase imprinting technique @xcite , where a finite fraction of the 1d atomic cloud is subject to an external potential for a certain time .",
    "once the potential is switched off and the gas is allowed to evolve , the ds is formed around the place with the maximal gradient of the potential .",
    "drawing an analogy with the electronic field - emission from a metal : a pulse of a strong external electric field may lead to creation of free electrons outside of the metal surface .",
    "it is well - known , however , from the time of von lenard and einstein @xcite that this is not the only way to excite electrons .",
    "indeed , a weak ac field results in a photoelectric current , as long as the energy of its quanta exceeds the threshold given by the work function of the metal .",
    "the difference between the field - emission and the photoelectric effects is that the latter essentially utilizes the quantum nature of the electromagnetic radiation .",
    "is there an analog of the photoelectric effect for excitation of ds ?",
    "namely can the ds be created by a weak ac radiation with the frequency exceeding a certain threshold ?    in the framework of the gross - pitaevskii equation",
    "the answer on these questions is negative .",
    "indeed , a weak external field may lead to excitation of the linear waves , if its wavenumber and frequency satisfy bogoliubov dispersion relation , but not to creation of ds .",
    "however , treating the bose liquid beyond the semiclassical gross - pitaevskii approximation reveals that creation of ds in response on an absorption of a single quanta with an above - the - threshold energy is actually possible . in analogy with the photoelectric effect we call this phenomenon the _ photo - solitonic effect_. the threshold energy is given by the energy of ds @xmath5 with the momentum @xmath6 , where @xmath3 is the photon wavenumber .",
    "creation of ds requires an ac field with frequency @xmath7 .",

    "@xmath9 ever appears in the gross - pitaevskii treatment .",
    "consider 1d bose liquid subject to an external ac potential with the wavenumber @xmath3 and frequency @xmath8 .",
    "such a radiation may be created using bragg scattering technique  @xcite . in these experiments",
    "the ac potential has been created by the interference pattern of two non - collinear optical beams with the differential frequency @xmath8 and the @xmath10-component of the differential wavevector @xmath3 , [ ] . at zero temperature , according to the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , the probability to absorb the radiation is given by the dynamic structure factor ( dsf ) , defined as the density - density correlation function @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the density operator .",

    "this observation offers a way to interpret absorption in a vicinity of the lieb i mode , @xmath27 , in terms of weakly interacting bogoliubov quasiparticles .",

    "e.g. _ , a photon with some wave vector @xmath3 and energy @xmath0 slightly below the value @xmath28 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath29 , see point a in fig .",
    "[ fig : continuum](a ) .",
    "the energy and momentum conservation laws allow for such photon to create two bogoliubov quasiparticles , @xmath30 . in the limit @xmath31 ,",
    "one of the two particles has small momentum and may be viewed as a `` soft '' phonon . for smaller initial photon energies ,",
    "the resulting two quasiparticles split the photon momentum more evenly , until the photon energy reaches the limiting value @xmath32 .",
    "if the photon energy is decreased below this threshold , a creation of more than two quasiparticles is needed to satisfy the conservation laws . upon further lowering @xmath0 ,",

    "correspondingly the photon absorption in the energy window ( [ window ] ) necessarily involves excitation of ds along with bogoliubov quasiparticles and/or phonons .",

    "indeed , ds with the momentum @xmath45 accompanied by a phonon , propagating in the direction of the external momentum @xmath2 , obviously satisfies the energy and momentum conservation .",
    "similarly , ds with the momentum @xmath46 must be accompanied by the counter - propagating phonon .",
    "any other soliton from the momentum window ( [ momentum - window ] ) requires excitation of a certain superposition of the forward and backward propagating phonons .    in this paper",
    "we evaluate probability @xmath47 to excite ds with the momentum @xmath48 in the range ( [ momentum - window ] ) upon absorption of a photon with the wavenumber @xmath3 and frequency @xmath49 .",
    "we show that such a probability is heavily shifted towards the lower boundary of the interval @xmath50 , i.e. ds is preferentially excited along with the _ forward _ moving phonon . at larger photon energies , while still in the interval ( [ window ] ) , ds is excited with highest probability along with the forward moving bogoliubov quasiparticle .",
    "its energy and momentum may be found geometrically by plotting the replica of the bogoliubov dispersion curve which starts at some point along the lieb ii mode , @xmath19 , and passes through the point @xmath51 representing external photon .",
    "we also show that the total probability to excite any ds scales as a power of the blue detuning from the energy threshold , @xmath52 . the exponent @xmath53 is a function of photon wavenumber and the strength of interactions between the bosons .",
    "in the relevant limit of the weakly interacting gas , the exponent is large @xmath54 , signifying the relative smallness of the photo - solitonic effect .",

    "an important question is what are the corresponding rates for a larger energy of the photon : @xmath203 .",
    "according to the arguments given in the introduction , absorption of such a photon should necessarily lead to ds formation . yet",

    "this is because bogoliubov quasiparticles with momenta above @xmath205 that take the excess energy can not be well approximated by phonons .",

    "physically the origin of this smallness is in the orthogonality phenomenon : the state of the system immediately after absorption of the photon is almost orthogonal to the state with the soliton causing a re - distribution of density and phase of the condensate in the one - dimensional system .",
    "the corresponding matrix element is exponentially small in the parameter @xmath112 .",
    "this fact dictates a rather stringent limitations on the experimental observability of the photo - solitonic effect . increasing interactions ( i.e. decreasing @xmath164 ) makes the exponential factor in the photo - solitonic rate less severe , on the other hand it simultaneously decreases @xmath112 , making it more difficult to observe the excited solitons . assuming @xmath212 , ref .",
