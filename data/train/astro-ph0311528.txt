    "the study of high - redshift galaxies in the early universe has seen substantial progress in recent times , with the discovery of objects out to @xmath14 ( hu et al .",
    "2002 , kodaira et al . 2003 ) and with the rapidly increasing number of galaxies discovered at redshifts @xmath15 ( @xcite ; hu , cowie , & mcmahon 1998 ; @xcite ; hu , mcmahon , & cowie 1999 ; @xcite ) .",
    "active galaxies associated with radio galaxies @xcite and agn discovered in deep x - ray exposures with chandra @xcite have been seen out to @xmath16 , and at optical wavelengths quasars have been found with the sloan survey out to @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "however , because of the relatively sparse distribution of detectable @xmath18 galaxies it has hitherto been difficult to confirm more than a few at a time , and thus to develop the large samples needed to understand the robustness of candidate selection criteria and the spatial structure of objects on the sky .",
    "consequently there are large uncertainties in the inferred luminosity function and universal star formation rates .",
    "the availability of mosaic ccds allows wide - field coverage of the sky on scales of half a degree to a degree at a time ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this gives us the opportunity to generate large samples of objects to examine their statistical properties and construct more precise luminosity functions .",
    "this paper is the first in a series which will describe searches for ly@xmath1 emission - line galaxies at @xmath19 and @xmath14 in a number of such wide fields .",
    "it represents a continuation of our narrowband filter survey @xcite , which probed for ly@xmath1 emission from @xmath20 using smaller area surveys .",
    "we use the wide - field capabilities of suprimecam @xcite on the subaru 8.3-m telescope to obtain samples of narrowband selected ly@xmath1 emitters .",
    "following @xcite we use narrowband filters corresponding to @xmath21 and @xmath22 ly@xmath1 emission lines which lie in dark spectral portions of the night sky .",
    "we combine these with extremely deep continuum observations to select the high-@xmath23 emission - line galaxies in a statistically uniform fashion .",
    "we then use the new wide - field deimos spectrograph on the keck ii 10-m telescope to obtain a nearly complete spectroscopic followup .    in the present paper",
    "we describe our survey of @xmath21 lyman alpha emitters in a 700 square arcminute area around the ssa22 field @xcite",
    ". the existence of extremely deep multi - color @xmath24 continuum images for this field allows a detailed examination of the effectiveness of color selection criteria in identifying ly@xmath1 candidates at @xmath0 , similar to our studies at @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "in particular , we can examine the robustness of color thresholds for the selection of ly@xmath1 emitters as contrasted with [ o ]  and [ o ]  emission - line galaxies .",
    "discriminating ly@xmath1 emitters from lower @xmath23 emission - line objects can be difficult at lower redshifts @xcite , but at higher redshifts the continuum break signature becomes so extreme that there is little likelihood of a misidentification provided we have sufficiently deep continuum images .",
    "songaila and cowie @xcite have used spectra of the bright quasars to measure the average transmission of the ly@xmath1 forest region as a function of redshift over the @xmath26 range .",
    "their results translate to a magnitude break across the ly@xmath1 emission line of @xmath27 for @xmath19 systems this corresponds to a 3.4 magnitude break , and color measurements alone can be used to provide a substantial selection of high-@xmath23 galaxy candidates ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , because the continuum magnitudes are extremely faint only the deepest observations currently feasible can find such objects , while the emission - line objects are much easier to find .",
    "furthermore , continuum selected objects can be extremely hard to confirm spectroscopically , while the narrowband selected objects are generally easy to identify .",
    "thus the narrowband filter samples provide an invaluable tool for identifying large homogeneous samples of high - redshift galaxies .    with high - resolution spectroscopic followups of the candidates it is possible to both confirm that the emission is due to red - shifted ly@xmath1 and to estimate the statistics of interlopers . for",
    "ssa22 our narrowband and color selections yield an initial sample of 26 candidate @xmath21 emitters in the field . the powerful new wide - field spectroscopic capabilities of the deimos spectrograph @xcite used on the keck 10-m telescope , with an approximate field of @xmath28 and good red sensitivity , allow us to follow up these candidates in an extremely efficient manner .",
    "we have now observed 23 of the 26 objects with either this instrument or with the lris spectrograph @xcite on keck .",
    "this results in the confirmation of 19 new redshift @xmath0 galaxies .",
    "the 18 candidates observed with deimos unambiguously show asymmetric profiles with the high resolution observing mode possible with this red - optimized spectrograph .    in section  [ secdata ]",
    "we summarize the narrowband and continuum imaging together with the spectroscopic observations .",
    "section  [ secanal ] describes the color selection and color - color plots for our selection criteria .",
    "the spectroscopic identifications and colors of candidates are tabulated and labeled in these diagrams . in section  [ secclass ] we discuss the spectroscopic identifications of ly@xmath1 emitters , and the incidence and properties of foreground emitters . in section  [ secdisc ] we discuss the spatial structure of the objects in the fields and show that they are highly correlated .",
    "we compare the shapes and equivalent widths of the lines with those of lower redshift samples and discuss their interpretation .",
    "finally , the ly@xmath1 and uv continuum luminosity functions of the identified @xmath0 candidates are constructed and compared with lower redshift samples .",
    "we argue that the star formation rates at @xmath0 are probably at least comparable to those at lower redshifts , but postpone a more detailed discussion until we can use an ensemble average of a number of wide fields .",

    "this is much wider than would be expected from the velocity dispersions of the parent galaxies at this redshift and almost certainly represents velocity broadening of the ly@xmath1 during the escape from the galaxy .",
    "given the complexity of this process there is probably relatively little useful information in the widths .",
    "the truncation also results in the measured redshifts , which were set to the peak of the line , being about a 100 km  s@xmath11 redward of the true redshift ,      since the narrow band lies almost precisely in the center of the @xmath30 band the truncation effect reduces the @xmath30 band flux and the narrow band flux in very similar amounts and we shall assume that the equivalent widths ( ews ) of the lines do not need to be corrected for this effect .",
    "( this approximation does depend on the igm scattering not extending substantially redward of the line center which could be incorrect . )",

    "[ fig17:ew - dist ] .",
    "in contrast to the results of @xcite most of the rest frame equivalent widths have values less than 240   , which can be understood in terms of galaxies with salpeter initial mass functions .",
    "( see malhotra and rhoads for an extensive discussion of this issue . ) as discussed in the previous paragraph , the equivalent width determination is very sensitive to the depth of the continuum band exposures , and the difference between the present results and those of @xcite may arise from the deeper continuum exposures used here .",
    "only four of the objects have poorly defined rest frame equivalent widths and are shown at nominal values of 240    in the figure but even these objects could well lie at lower values based on the uncertainties in the determination .",

    "<S> we report the results of a wide - field narrowband survey for redshift @xmath0 ly@xmath1 emitters carried out with the @xmath2 field - of - view suprimecam mosaic ccd camera on the subaru 8.3-m telescope . </S>",
    "<S> deep narrowband imaging of the ssa22 field through a 120  bandpass filter centered at a nominal wavelength of 8150   was combined with deep multicolor @xmath3 broadband imaging with suprimecam , then supplemented with @xmath4 imaging taken with the @xmath5 field - of - view cfh12k camera on the canada - france - hawaii 3.6-m telescope to select high - redshift galaxy candidates . </S>",
    "<S> spectroscopic observations were made using the new wide - field multi - object deimos spectrograph on the 10-m keckii telescope for 22 of the 26 candidate objects . </S>",
    "<S> eighteen of these objects were identified as @xmath0 lyman alpha emitters , and a further nineteenth object from the candidate list was identified based on an lris spectrum . at the 3.3   resolution of the deimos observations the asymmetric profile for ly@xmath1 emission with its steep blue fall - off can be clearly seen in the spectra of the identified galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this is by far the largest spectroscopic sample of galaxies at these redshifts , and we use it to describe the distribution of equivalent widths and continuum color break properties for identified ly@xmath1 galaxies compared with the foreground population . </S>",
    "<S> the large majority ( at least 75% ) of the lines have rest frame ly@xmath1 equivalent widths substantially less than 240    and can be understood in terms of young star forming galaxies with a salpeter initial mass function for the stars . with the narrowband selection criteria of ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( ab mags ) we find a surface density of ly@xmath1 emitters of 0.03 per square arcminute in the filter bandpass ( @xmath8 ) down to a limiting flux of just under @xmath9 erg @xmath10 s@xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity function of the ly@xmath1 emitters is similar to that at lower redshifts to the lowest measurable luminosity of @xmath12 erg s@xmath11 as is the universal star formation rate based on their continuum properties . </S>",
    "<S> however , we note that the objects are highly structured in both their spatial and spectral properties on the angular scale of the fields ( @xmath13 mpc ) , and that multiple fields will have to be averaged to accurately measure their ensemble properties . </S>"
