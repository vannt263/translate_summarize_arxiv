    "an outstanding problem in qcd is the extrapolation of limited perturbation - theory information so as to make contact with experiment .",
    "an important example is given by the running coupling constant , in which low - order calculations are summed by the renormalization group . it has been known since the early 1950 s that this is really not self - consistent , because of the appearance of an unphysical spacelike singularity , the `` ghost - pole . ''",
    "however , as it has been argued in refs .",
    "@xcite , a possible way to resolve the ghost - pole problem for the qcd running coupling constant can be found by imposing klln ",
    "lehmann analyticity .",
    "this method , which was elaborated early in the development of qed @xcite leads to the definition of the analytic running coupling constant in the complex @xmath1-plane with a cut along the negative part of the real axis .",
    "( in this paper we use a metric with signature @xmath2 , so that @xmath3 corresponds to a spacelike momentum transfer . ) according to refs .",
    "@xcite the connection between the analytic coupling @xmath4 and the spectral density @xmath5 is given by the following spectral representation ( the overbar signifies the analytically improved quantity ) @xmath6 ( the questions about the validity of the spectral representation , which is rather obvious in qed , are resolved in @xcite for the general case . ) for instance , in the one - loop approximation to the spectral function , @xmath7 ^ 2 + a^2\\beta_0 ^ 2\\pi^2 } , \\label{specfn}\\ ] ] the corresponding analytic running coupling constant has the form @xmath8,\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the first coefficient of the @xmath0-function with @xmath10 active flavors , and @xmath11 is the qcd scale . the analytically - improved coupling constant ( [ a1 ] ) has no ghost pole at @xmath12 , and its correct analytic properties are provided by the nonperturbative contribution , the second term in ( [ a1 ] ) , which has appeared automatically through use of the spectral representation ( [ spectral ] ) .",
    "the analytic running coupling constant obtained in such a way turns out to be remarkable stable in the infrared region with respect to higher loop corrections and has the universal infrared limit at @xmath13 : @xmath14 , which does not depend on the value of @xmath11 , being a universal constant .",
    "the method described above defines the running coupling constant in the euclidean ( spacelike ) range of momentum , @xmath3 , where @xmath15 is real . in this paper",
    "we wish to parametrize processes with timelike momentum transfer , for example , the process of @xmath16 annihilation into hadrons .",
    "to do so , we must make use of some nontrivial analytic continuation procedure from the spacelike to the timelike region . to",
    "this end one usually applies the dispersion relation for the adler @xmath17-function , defined in terms of the correlation function for the quark vector current , @xmath18 , as follows @xmath19 this `` vacuum polarization '' satisfies an unsubtracted dispersion relation , @xmath20 with the @xmath16 annihilation ratio is given by @xmath21.\\ ] ] consequently , the dispersion relation for the adler function is @xmath22    the @xmath17-function is an analytic function in the complex @xmath1 plane with a cut along the negative real axis .",
    "taking into account these analytic properties we can write down the inverse relation for @xmath23 , @xmath24 where the contour goes from the point @xmath25 to the point @xmath26 and lies in the region of analyticity of the function @xmath27 .",
    "let us define effective coupling constants @xmath28 in the spacelike region and @xmath29 in the timelike region based on the following expressions for @xmath30 and @xmath23 @xmath31,\\ ] ] @xmath32,\\ ] ] where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the first coefficients of perturbative expansions .",
    "( the superscript @xmath35 refers to the summation of all the remaining terms in the perturbative expansion of these quantities . ) in fact , @xmath36 .",
    "the subscript @xmath37 in ( [ rqeff ] ) means  @xmath37-channel \" ( the timelike region ) . from ( [ dq2 ] ) and ( [ rs ] ) ,",
    "one finds the connections between these effective coupling constants in the spacelike and timelike regions : @xmath38 and @xmath39    these equations serve to define the effective coupling @xmath40 which parametrizes the @xmath23 ratio and plays the role of the running coupling in the timelike region .",
    "one usually applies the standard perturbative approximation for @xmath41 to derive the effective coupling in the @xmath37-channel from ( [ aseff ] ) .",
    "this way leads to the so - called @xmath42-terms which play an important role in the phenomenological analysis of various processes @xcite .",
    "however , the perturbative approximation of @xmath41 breaks the analytic properties mentioned above .",
    "for example , in the one - loop approximation the function @xmath41 has the form @xmath43 $ ] with a ghost pole at @xmath44 , which contradicts the assumption that @xmath41 is an analytic function in the cut @xmath45-plane .",
    "a consequence of this problem is the fact that if @xmath46 , obtained in such a way , is substituted into ( [ aeff ] ) , the original one - loop formula in the spacelike region is not reproduced .",
    "this difficulty can be avoided in the framework of what we call analytic perturbation theory , in which the running coupling constant is forced to have the correct analytic properties .- function can also be maintained in the framework of the so - called variational perturbation theory @xcite which is based on a new small expansion parameter @xcite .",
    "] we define @xmath47 in terms of the spectral density according to ( [ spectral ] ) , that is , the effective coupling in the spacelike region is given by @xmath48 as a result , from ( [ aseff ] ) and ( [ aeffdisp ] ) , the effective coupling in the timelike region is given by the following elegant expression : @xmath49    it is clear that both coupling constants @xmath50 and @xmath40 have the same universal limit at @xmath51 and @xmath52 and a similar tails as @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "however , in the intermediate region the effect of analytic continuation becomes important .",
    "as we will see in perturbation theory , below , the distinction between the different effective coupling constants is several percent , which may be important for extracting the qcd coupling constant from various experimental data .",
    "let us consider this problem at the one - loop level .",
    "the perturbative contribution of the leading logarithms to the effective coupling in the spacelike region can be written as follows : @xmath55 in any finite order this function has the correct analytic properties .",
    "the ghost pole appears due to the naive sum of the infinite geometrical series in ( [ aeff2 ] ) .",
    "however , we should consider the series in ( [ aeff2 ] ) as an asymptotic series and try to find its sum in such a way to maintain the required analytic properties , taking into account the fact that the sum of an asymptotic series is not unique . to this end , let us consider the correlation function for which , from ( [ dq2p ] ) and ( [ dqeff ] ) , the contribution of the leading logarithms has the following form : @xmath56 carrying out the sum and taking the imaginary part , we immediately find from ( [ rsp ] ) @xmath57 where @xmath58 . by introducing the qcd parameter @xmath59",
    ", we obtain for the running coupling constant in the @xmath37-channel @xmath60 the same result for the running coupling constant in the timelike region can be obtained by substituting the one - loop spectral density ( [ specfn ] ) into ( [ schan ] ) . moreover",
    ", the substitution of ( [ aeffs2 ] ) into ( [ aeff ] ) reproduces the one - loop analytic running coupling ( [ a1 ] ) which parametrizes the @xmath17-function and has the asymptotic expansion ( [ aeff2 ] ) .",
    "thus , the summation of the leading logarithms for the physical quantity @xmath23 leads to a @xmath17-function with the correct analytic properties .",
    "let us compare the two one - loop couplings @xmath61 , given by ( [ aeffs2 ] ) , and @xmath62 , given by ( [ a1 ] ) .",
    "as noted above , they have a universal value at 0 , @xmath63 and in fact are exactly the same at @xmath64 , @xmath12 .",
    "asymptotically , for large spacelike and timelike momenta , respectively , @xmath65 exhibiting the fact that the @xmath66- and @xmath37-channel couplings differ in three - loop order . in general",
    ", these two couplings , in their respective regimes , agree numerically quite closely , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , with the relative difference being no more than 9% , as shown in fig .",
    "similar features hold in two - loop order , the discrepancy between the couplings in the intermediate region dropping to about 5% .",
    "more than two decades ago , schwinger proposed @xcite that the gell - mann  low function , or the @xmath0-function , in qed could be represented by a spectral function for the photon propagator , which has direct physical meaning . the precise connection , of course , depends on the definition of the running coupling constant @xcite .",
    "remarkably , we find that this idea is realized in our proposal for the timelike coupling constant in qcd . for the @xmath0-function which corresponds to the coupling defined in the euclidean region this statement is true through the two - loop approximation , but breaks down if one takes into account three - loop contributions .",
    "( the analogous thing happens in qed for the conventional charge definitions @xcite .",
    ") however , schwinger s identification is certainly correct if we construct the @xmath0-function for the coupling ( [ schan ] ) defined in the timelike region : indeed , @xmath67 as noted above , in perturbation theory , the difference between the couplings in the spacelike and timelike regions is given by three - loop diagrams and , therefore , @xmath68 .",
    "we have considered the procedure of constructing the qcd running coupling constant by using analytic perturbation theory .",
    "the fundamental quantity here is the spectral density @xmath69 , in terms of which the running coupling in the euclidean region is expressed through the spectral representation ( [ aeffdisp ] ) , while the running coupling in the timelike region is expressed by ( [ schan ] ) .",
    "both these couplings have the same universal infrared limit @xmath70 which turns out to be remarkably stable with respect to higher loop corrections @xcite .",
    "further , both coupling constants have the same leading asymptotic behavior .",
    "thus , in comparison with standard perturbation theory , the strong requirement of analyticity modifies the theory in the infrared and intermediate domains significantly , which is particularly relevant for a physical description of the timelike regime .",
    "finally , we have shown that schwinger s proposed connection between the renormalization group @xmath0-function and the spectral density is valid for the coupling defined in the timelike region .",
