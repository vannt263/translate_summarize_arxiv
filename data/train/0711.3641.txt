    "the now widely accepted accelerated expansion of the universe in its recent history is yet to be fully explained . several possibilities to reproduce this effect have been advanced , ranging from `` conservative '' to very unusual ones requiring new physics .",

    "some effort has been made to remove the big rip singularity , but it is still premature to rule out or support definitely any scenario .",
    "we work within a general phantom energy scenario in this paper .",
    "it has already been acknowledged that , being such an exotic physical species , the phantom energy may also change the accretion regime of black holes @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we investigate the influence of phantom energy accretion onto primordial black holes ( hereafter pbhs ) together with the radiation and matter accretion / evaporation formerly addressed .",
    "the pbh interaction with different types of energy in the universe is the continuous subject of several sudies , as well as their interaction with cosmological boundary condidiotns @xcite .",
    "several numerical results also work as test fields for alternate gravitational theories , and the questions regarding their very formation at extreme cosmological scenarios are beginning to yield several interesting results @xcite .    we shall focus on the new features specifically introduced by the phantom era @xcite , and generally refer to the full evolution of the pbhs across the mass - time plane .",
    "previous attempts to address this problem have been limited to the consideration of the black holes plus phantom fluid only , although there is a more subtle interplay among components when radiation and matter are also included ( as will be shown below ) .",
    "it is also of interest to revisit the issue of the black hole behavior in the radiation - dominated and matter - dominated eras ( that is , well before the phantom component can be important ) for a complete assessment of the fate of pbhs , especially their behavior in the matter - dominated era where dark matter may fuel their growth .",
    "our starting point will be the evolution equation for pbhs in the radiation - dominated era addressed by several authors ( see custdio and horvath @xcite and references therein ) , which takes into account the accretion of radiation and the hawking evaporation at a semiclassical level . ignoring the ( potentially relevant ) `` grey factors '' in the absorption of radiation , the resulting differential equation for the black hole mass @xmath4 reads quite generally    @xmath5    with @xmath6 being the cosmological time , @xmath7 , with @xmath8 called the _ running constant _",

    "we call such an epoch the _ phantom time _ , or @xmath20 .",
    "it must be noted that this instant is distinct from the one when the lines of figure [ evolucao ] cross each other .",
    "the phantom time represents the cosmological instant when the phantom energy accretion term dominates the radiation term , changing drastically the black hole evolution dynamics .",
    "we can calculate the value of this time as a function of the initial radiation and phantom energy densities .",

    "we can express this transition time in terms of the redshift , using eq .",
    ", with the initial conditions @xmath31 and @xmath32 appropriate for the obtained conditions , finally coming to @xmath33 .",
    "it is reasonable to suppose the transition between radiation and phantom accretion to be instantaneous due to the very steep radiation / phantom density ratio , which can be easily seen by rewriting eq .   for an arbitrary epoch .",
    "@xmath34    the radiation density quickly becomes negligible compared to the phantom energy .",
    "the higher the @xmath35 , the quicker the transition becomes .",
    "up to this point we have neglected completely the possible effects of ( cold ) dark matter on the pbhs , which is a popular and reasonable explanation for the structure formation problem . within the cdm scenario , right after the decoupling of dark matter its accretion onto black holes will depend on the black hole cross - section for point - like particles .",
    "therefore , the time dependence of the mass would be given by    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the dark matter particle density , computed after the decoupling    @xmath38    well before the phantom energy becomes important , the pbh mass equation , including now the dark matter contribution , is just    @xmath39    we must remark that we are always referring to a _ diffuse _",
    "cdm component , an appropriate assumption prior to any structure formation .",
    "because we are interested in the fate of a wide range of black hole masses , we should integrate equation   numerically for several initial conditions and cosmological parameters .    to solve this equation , we first rewrite it in explicitly time - dependent terms    @xmath40    letting @xmath41 and @xmath42 , @xmath43 yields    @xmath44    setting @xmath45 and @xmath46 ,",
    "equation   reads    @xmath47    which can be solved introducing new variables @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , yielding an equation of the form    @xmath51    with @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .    the dark matter accretion should be taken into account for @xmath55 .",
    "we may also introduce an instant @xmath56 similar to the phantom time , in which the dark matter and radiation accretion have the same value .",
    "an estimate for @xmath57 and @xmath56 is given by    @xmath58    table [ xis ] summarizes a few numerical estimates for @xmath57 and @xmath56 , covering most of the important pbh masses .",
    ".numerical values for @xmath57 and @xmath59 for some initial values for the black hole mass , along with calculations for the times of evaporation with ( @xmath60 ) and without ( @xmath61 ) dark matter .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     an inspection of table [ xis ] shows that only black holes with masses greater than 10@xmath62  g should be influenced by the dark matter accretion at early times . however , this effect of the dark matter term happens to be small , because it is rapidly overcome by the accretion of radiation .",
    "this can be expected on physical grounds because the geometrical dilution of the dark matter component  starves \" the pbhs by quickly diminishing the flux of particles coming into them .",
    "note that this particular evolution does _ not _ refer to much later epochs where dark matter halos had formed , possibly then contributing to the growth of pbhs as seeds for the ultimate supermassive galactic residents .",
    "the numerical results for the evolution through time are depicted in figure [ thegraph ] for the highest initial condition , as an example .",
    "the resulting bump in the mass ( fig .",
    "[ thegraph ] ) has been exaggerated for the sake of clarity .",
    "with expression eq .   for the time , we can calculate the value of the critical mass @xmath63 in the instant @xmath20 . from custdio and horvath @xcite , the expression for the critical mass",
    "is    @xmath64    during the late phantom energy accretion dominance era , a critical mass function would be meaningless , since there is no longer a relevant mass increase mechanism .",
    "thus , the largest value reachable by the critical mass in a universe filled only by radiation and phantom energy is    @xmath65    after this time , the hawking evaporation is no longer a relevant mechanism for black hole mass decrease , until its mass reaches the transition value discussed in section [ transitiontime ] .",
    "it is also convenient to calculate the initial mass of the black hole which disappears at @xmath20 .",
    "for that purpose , it is enough to consider only the hawking term in eq .  , which yields the well - known solution    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the evaporation timescale .",
    "restoring the cgs units @xmath67 reads    @xmath68    combining eq .   and eq .  , we find a third degree equation in @xmath63 , whose solution is the critical mass of the black hole that will evaporate _ completely _ at @xmath69    @xmath70    we use the numerical values of @xmath71 @xcite and @xmath72 , as well as the numerical values of @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath1 and @xmath27 necessary to compute @xmath20 .",
    "the instant when the critical mass assumes this value is found by inverting eq .  .",
    "since the mass gain due to radiation accretion is not substantial @xcite , all black holes with @xmath75 , which reach critical mass at @xmath76 , will disappear before @xmath20 and will never reach the phantom era .",
    "we have emphasized before that , since after @xmath20 there is no efficient mechanism that could increase the mass of the black holes , there is no longer a critical mass function .",
    "however , due to the presence of a phantom field , there are now _ two _ distinct regimes of mass decrease , whose relative importance depends on the mass of a given pbh entering the phantom era .",
    "taking eq .   and",
    "neglecting the radiation term , we can describe the evolution of black hole masses during the phantom era .",
    "let us define a ratio between the two remaining terms ,    @xmath77    or , in terms of a _ transition mass _",
    "@xmath78    with    @xmath79^{\\nicefrac{1}{4}}\\ ] ]    substituting numerical values for the constants , we obtain an expression for @xmath80 in terms of the phantom field density    @xmath81^{-\\nicefrac{1}{4}}~\\mathrm{g}\\ ] ]    with @xmath73 given in g / cm@xmath10 .",
    "since both regimes are of mass _ decrease _ , the black hole mass will diminish mostly due to phantom accretion until it reaches @xmath80 . after this , the predominant effect will be hawking evaporation , since eq .",
    "shows that the change in regimes is sufficiently sudden for us to make this approximation .    to find the time dependence of the transition mass ,",
    "we must first know the evolution of the phantom density . according to the friedmann equations for the phantom fluid",
    ", we finally obtain @xcite    @xmath83    with @xmath84 being the initial density of the phantom field . inserting this result on equation eq .",
    "the time dependence of @xmath80 is obtained    @xmath85^{\\frac{1}{2}}~\\mathrm{g}\\ ] ]    the initial value of the transition mass depends on both the initial value of the phantom density and on @xmath1 .",
    "it is worth remarking that this transition mass is meaningless in the radiation - accretion regime .",
    "the differences between the three regimes is depicted in figure [ thegraph ] .",
    "it is important to stress that the hawking evaporation does not become negligible after @xmath20 if taken into account as an independent process .",
    "however , the masses for which it becomes important ( @xmath86 ) drop by a factor of @xmath87 after the transition .",
    "this suddenly drives many black holes , but not all , into the new regime .",
    "when , however , the black holes reach the planck mass , a full quantum gravity analysis becomes necessary to properly determine its fate , since it has been shown that the hawking evaporation no longer behaves as expected on such scales @xcite .",
    "we have studied in the present work the evolution of pbh for various regimes of accretion / evaporation in the very early and contemporary universe . in particular , we have extended and clarified the evolution in the radiation - dominated and matter - dominated eras , including the features of diffuse cdm accretion producing only a small bump in the mass of the pbhs at early times .",
    "we have generally confirmed previously known features of the semiclassical pictures of pbh evolution from a general point of view .",
    "novel features are introduced in this scenario when a phantom energy component is introduced , as suggested by babichev , dokuchaev and eroshenko @xcite .",
    "broadly speaking , a phantom field introduces another evaporation regime that competes with the celebrated hawking evaporation .",
    "we have found that the joint consideration of the relevant terms quenches the asymptotic approach to a common mass resulting from the phantom term only .",
    "this conclusion should , however , not be considered as definitive .",
    "its validity rests on the assumption of the entropy for the phantom fluid being negligible , which is not the most general possibility .",
    "in fact , the enforcement of the generalized second law ( gsl ) of thermodynamics would _ forbid _ the evaporation of the pbhs by phantom accretion @xcite in addition , it is not clear whether the gsl should be valid in presence of the phantom fluid not respecting the dominant energy condition , as pointed out by izquierdo and pavn @xcite , and models may be constructed in which the gsl must be modified .",
    "there is a rich variety of behaviors @xcite within phantom energy models that remains to be explored in connection with the pbh evolution problem .",
    "in particular , late evaporation may conflict with the generalized second law of thermodynamics @xcite .",
