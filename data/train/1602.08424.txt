    "controlling the coupling between the atoms and the light beams creating the optical lattice allows to realize simple models  @xcite that were first formulated in different fields of physics from condensed matter to particle physics and biological systems .",
    "these models would be useful for quantum simulation purposes  @xcite and quantum information processing ( qip ) applications .",
    "specifically , one can realize effective hamiltonians which contain short - range physical processes such as tunneling between neighbor lattice sites and on - site interactions .",
    "the implementation of long - range interactions that extends over many lattice sites is an extremely challenging task since it requires the use of more complex systems such as polar molecules  @xcite or rydberg atoms  @xcite .",
    "moreover , spatial structure of the interaction itself is fixed by the physical system used ( e.g. dipole - dipole interaction for molecules and van der waals interaction for rydberg atoms ) and can not be changed .",
    "in contrast to these examples , we show that by loading an optical lattice inside a cavity allows to engineer synthetic many - body interactions with an arbitrary spatial profile .",
    "these interactions are mediated by the light field and do not depend on fundamental processes , making them extremely tunable and suitable for realizing quantum simulations of many - body long - range hamiltonians .",
    "in contrast to other proposals based on light - mediated interactions  @xcite , we suggest a novel approach , where the shortening of the a priori infinitely long - range ( global ) light - induced interaction does not degrade the collective light - matter interaction , but rather benefits from it .",
    "in particular , in contrast to other proposals , where shortening of the interaction length requires increasing number of light modes , in our case , rather short - range interactions can be simulated with small number of light modes .",
    "moreover , even a single mode cavity is enough to simulate some finite - range interactions . as a result , the quantum phase of matter posses properties of systems with both short - range and global collective interactions .",
    "the effective hamiltonians can be an acceptable representation of an otherwise experimentally hard to achieve quantum degenerate system with finite range interaction .    in this article",
    "we present how different arrangements involving multiple probes and/or multiple light modes for detecting the scattered light , lead to these synthetic interactions .",
    "the setups we propose are an extension of recent experimental breakthroughs where optical lattices in a single mode cavity have been achieved  @xcite . under these conditions , light and matter",
    "are both in the full quantum regime , thus we have a quantum optical lattice .",
    "this behaviour follows from the dynamical properties of the light  @xcite and the structural dicke phase transition that occurs and forms a state with supersolid features  @xcite .",
    "currently , the study of the full quantum regime of the system has been limited to few atoms  @xcite . as the light matter coupling",
    "is strongly enhanced in a high finesse optical cavity in a preferred wavelength , the atoms reemit light with the backaction comparable with that of the lasers used in the trapping process . as a consequence , an effective long - range ( nonlocal ) interaction emerges driven by the cavity field .",

    "the light inside the cavity can be used to control the formation of many - body phases of matter even in a single cavity mode  @xcite .",
    "this leads to several effects yet to be observed due to the dynamical properties of light  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that multimode atomic density patterns can emerge , even their coherences can become structured and light - matter quantum correlations can control the formation of correlated phases . our goal is to explore the landscape of emergent quantum many - body phases the system is able to support by means of these light induced interactions .",

    "thus , a plethora of novel quantum phases due to the imprinting of structure by design in the effective light - induced interaction occurs  @xcite .",
    "in addition quantum many - body phases can be measured via light - scattering measurements  @xcite , or by matter wave scattering  @xcite , and dynamical structure factors can be obtained via homodyne detection  @xcite and leaking of photons from the cavity  @xcite .",

    "additionally , multimode cavities extend the possibilities for quantum phases even further  @xcite . thus making our synthetic interactions feasible in the near future .",
    "we will explore how by carefully tuning system parameters and the spatial structure of light , one can design with plenty of freedom the quantum many - body phases that emerge and one can even simulate finite range many - body interactions using the mode structure imprinted by the light . the quantum nature of the potential seen by the atoms will change the landscape of correlated quantum many - body phases beyond classical optical lattice setups .    our work will foster the design of multicomponent states and their possible application towards quantum multimode systems in optomechanics  @xcite . moreover , our approach can aid in the simulation by means of networks  @xcite . toward quantum state engineering",

    "these effective interactions will be useful for the purpose of quantum simulation of finite range interactions among other possible applications .",
    "then we show , how one can construct and effective general representation of the mode hamiltonians , and solve relevant cases for current and future experiments depending on the geometry of light .",

    "this external potential is insensitive to the quantum state of atoms .",
    "the light scattered into the cavity constitutes a quantum perturbation of the strong classical potential .",
    "this perturbation strongly depends on the many - body atomic state .",
    "furthermore , the classical optical lattice and light in the cavity can be detuned from each other .    moreover , it is useful to exploit the spatial structure of light as a natural basis to define atomic modes , as the coupling coefficients @xmath38 can periodically repeat in space  @xcite , and as we will show arbitrarily designed .",
    "all atoms equally coupled to light belong to the same mode , while the ones coupled differently belong to different modes @xmath39 .",

    "these encompass the different sets of values taken by the wannier overlap integrals @xmath47  @xcite for each mode of the cavity system , either a single mode cavity with one pump and one cavity or a multi - mode cavity , and even multiple cavities and multiple pumps .",
    "the hamiltonian as it is has a light and matter sector that has a complicated structure .",
    "however , in the good cavity limit @xmath48 while @xmath49 and @xmath50 we have that the light field can be adiabatically eliminated . in general , the problem of reconstruction of the effective matter hamiltonian is hard , and there are several alternatives for this reconstruction as shown in  @xcite .",
    "thus , the light field becomes enslaved by the matter and vice versa , we refer to this as cavity back - action .",
    "this leads to the effective hamiltonian : @xmath51 with the effective coupling strengths , @xmath52 the sum over  @xmath53 \" goes over the cavity modes ( for a multi - mode cavity / several cavities ) and  @xmath54 \" and  @xmath55 \" go over the number of pumps .",

    "carefully analysis shows  @xcite , that beyond the adiabatic limit , additional terms modify the effective hamiltonian due to the non - commuting nature between light induced processes with the original matter hamiltonian and higher order photon processes . in what follows we will always consider the adiabatic limit .",

    ", we will discuss some simple examples of how the above hamiltonian can be used to generate synthetic interactions for quantum simulation , i.e. the couplings between the atoms is not a consequence of fundamental physical processes but are mediated by the light field and depend on the geometrical arrangement of the probe beam and the optical cavity .",

    "this is in contrast to the usual solid state physics scenarios where interactions do not depend on the specific position of two particles but only on their distance .",
    "this interaction is akin to multicomponent interactions due to different spin projections in a bec . here",

    "specifically , one has @xmath113 only if @xmath111 is a pure phase ( which can be obtained with one probe and one cavity ) .     in the above paragraph",
    ", we assumed the light mode functions to be traveling waves which allowed us to give a simple description of the synthetic interactions in terms of dft .",
    "importantly , the definition of the spatial modes does not rely on this assumption but only on the fact that the coefficients @xmath114 can have the same value on different lattice sites so that atoms in these positions scatter light with the same phase and intensity . for example , it is possible to realize the case @xmath87 by considering standing waves ( @xmath115 ) crossed at such angles to the lattice that @xmath116 is equal to @xmath117 and shifted such that all even sites are positioned at the nodes , so @xmath118 for @xmath27 odd while @xmath119 for @xmath27 even or the @xmath120 case by imposing @xmath121 so that the coefficients @xmath122 are @xmath123 $ ] .",

    "it is interesting to note that the half - filled case will aways be in the ss state for large interaction as this state will be in the tip of the dw lobe , and it will shift to have a large ( 2/3 ) or small ( 1/3 ) dw while increasing @xmath419",
    ". there will be an intermediate region where the state will be better described as a mixed state of both configurations , all this consistent with the @xmath458 limit and exact diagonalization simulations  @xcite .",
    "the density pattern that emerges in the system has a period of 3 in units of the lattice spacing . in the case of other angles",
    "such that @xmath459 the behaviour would be similar , but now instead dw insulating states and ss states would have period @xmath78 and the particular hierarchy of components and details in the competition between phases will be more complex as already foreseen in  @xcite .",
    "quantum light induces in its steady state an effective structured long range interaction .",
    "this steady - state effective many - body interaction changes the energetic landscape at the quantum level because atoms see a different energy landscape that depends on the cavity - pump detunings and the chosen spatial arrangement of the cavities and light pumped into the system .",
    "the atoms see a different energy landscape because the local energy at the sites is different in the illuminated regions .",
    "thus atoms will tend to occupy or avoid those regions in space depending on the detunings .",
    "the cavity pump detunings determine the mechanism that will drive the symmetry breaking .",
    "moreover , depending on the choice of the pattern of the light with respect to the classical optical lattice the tunneling between the sites can be maximized or suppressed depending on the wannier functions spatial overlap with the modes enhanced in the cavity .",
    "the interplay between the spatial distribution of the atoms given by the classical optical lattice and its characteristic wannier functions with the spatial structure of the light modes pumped into the cavity determines the structure of the site energies .",
    "thus scattering is maximized or minimized , changing the local energies enhancing different atomic processes . in turn",
    "the change in the light scattering from the atoms modifies the local energies and vice - versa , leading to a self - healing mechanism . the change in the local energies which couple to the density and coherence derived terms that couple to the tunneling amplitudes",
    "compete . depending on the light structure and this competition",
    "the overall energy landscape seen by the matter is set .",
    "when light is scattered minimally by the atoms the formation of a quantum optical lattice occurs and quantum fluctuations induced by light determine the modification or emergence of new phases in the system .",
    "if on the contrary , light scatters maximally a dynamical optical lattice will form where the self - organization mechanism will be precursor of new phases .",
    "this gives the opportunity via the structure of the light to modify by design the quantum many - body steady state of the matter which now has additional dependency via the quantum light .",
    "we have shown that the competition of additional processes due to the quantum light induced interaction with the regular processes ( tunneling ) and on - site repulsion in the bose - hubbard hamiltonian opens the possibility for the atoms to condense to new phases that are energetically favorable . among these new phases ,",
    "we have found : states with limited quantum fluctuations , density waves , supersolids , bosonic dimer states , multi - component density waves and multicomponent supersolids .",
    "thus , the system can support all these additional spatially structured many - body quantum phases besides from the superfluid and mott insulator homogeneous phases .",
    "the competition between global and local processes is the reason of the change in the phase diagram of the system .",
    "therefore , previously energetically unfavorable configurations , thus with a small probability of occurring , become stable possible configurations .",
    "this however , constraints the energetics to be on a certain region of the hilbert space . in turn",
    ", the quantum nature of the atoms can give massively degenerate sets of states that are equally likely , depending on how many symmetries in the system are broken .",
    "as symmetries are broken , the degeneracy gets suppressed and the number of equivalent configurations becomes smaller .",
    "thus , the emergence of structured quantum many - body phases occurs either via self - organization for dol or modification of quantum fluctuations for qol .",
    "moreover , we have shown that the structure imprinted by light onto the matter by design can be exploited to simulate long - range interaction by light induced mode interactions .",
    "certainly , this opens an additional venue of exploration towards quantum simulations .",
    "the effective mode hamiltonians can be an acceptable representation of an otherwise experimentally hard to achieve quantum degenerate system with finite range interaction .",
    "our developments can be applied to other systems where light - matter coupling can be enhanced and the structure of it designed by cavities and external probes , as the scheme relies on off - resonant scattering .",
    "these results can be used in multi - mode optomechanical systems  @xcite , and other arrays of naturally occurring or synthetic quantum degenerate systems such as , spins , fermions , molecules ( including biological ones )  @xcite , ions  @xcite , atoms in multiple cavities  @xcite , semiconductor  @xcite or superconducting qubits  @xcite .",
