    "considerable progress in the theoretical understanding of market phenomena has been achieved by the study of the minority game .",
    "this prototypical model describes a system of agents interacting through a market mechanism @xcite .",
    "the game is based on the idea that the behavior of the agents is determined by the economic rule of supply and demand . according to this rule ,",
    "given the available options ( such as buy / sell ) , an agent wins if he chooses the minority action .",
    "the research of this game has been focused on cases in which each agent can choose between two options using its most efficient strategy , where the strategies remain unchanged throughout the game @xcite . however , in the real world , many situations of interest involve more than two decision options as well as agents with dynamic strategies . making decisions like where to spend the summer vacation or which server to choose while surfing the web ( or more generally , how to distribute data traffic in computer networks @xcite ) are only two among many common problems with more than two options .",
    "therefore , it is tempting to investigate cases with more than two possible choices provided to agents with dynamic strategies . in a recent study of an extension in which each agent is equipped with a neural network for making his decision @xcite it was shown that a certain updating rule of the strategies of the agents improves the efficiency of the market , which is measured by the global profit of the agents . in this paper",
    "we generalize the aforementioned work to a multi - choice minority game , namely a game with general @xmath0 decision states .",
    "the multi - choice minority game consists of @xmath1 players ( agents ) and @xmath0 possible decisions . in each step , each one of the players chooses one of the @xmath0 states , aiming to choose the state with the smallest number of agents .",
    "for example , a situation may arise , in which there are several possible roads which lead from place a to place b , and each driver who wants to get from a to b chooses one of the available roads . because drivers want to avoid traffic jams , they try to choose the least traveled roads , assuming that all the roads are of the same length .",
    "similarly , one usually prefers to go to the bar with the smallest number of people in it . occurring over and over again ,",
    "the minority decisions in these and other similar situations generate time series whose term at time @xmath2 , @xmath3 , has an integer value between @xmath4 and @xmath0 according to the minority decision . in the original game , the information provided to each player is the history vector of size @xmath5 , whose components are the last @xmath5 minority states .    the paper is organized as follows : in section [ secmodel ] a multi - layer neural network and the dynamic evolution of its weights are introduced .",
    "for the clarity of the rest of the paper which is somewhat technical we briefly discuss the main findings and results . in section [ secrandom ]",
    "the reference case of players with random strategies is solved analytically . in section [ secoptimal ] the global profit of the players for the network with optimal strategies ( weights )",
    "is solved analytically in the thermodynamic limit , and shown to be superior to a random decision .",
    "the analytical results are compared with simulations on finite systems . in section [ secdynamics ] ,",
    "the suggested updating rules for the weights are examined analytically and are found to saturate asymptotically the optimal global profit . finally , section [ secsummary ] is devoted to a short summary and an outlook .",
    "while many strategies for the multi - choices minority game are conceivable , we study the following model which uses neural networks : each one of the @xmath1 players is represented by a perceptron of a size @xmath5 .",
    "the weights belonging to the @xmath6th player are @xmath7 where @xmath8 .",
    "all @xmath1 perceptrons have a common input which consists of @xmath5 components @xmath9 , where each one of the components can take one of the @xmath0 integers , @xmath10 , with equal probability .",
    "the dynamics are defined by the following steps . in the first step , each one of the perceptrons calculates the @xmath0 induced local fields .",
    "for instance , the field @xmath11 induced by the @xmath12th state on player @xmath6 is defined as the summation over all weights belonging to the @xmath6th perceptron with input equal to @xmath12 : @xmath13 in the second step , each player chooses its state , @xmath14 , following the maximal induced field : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the output ( chosen state ) of @xmath6th perceptron . in the third step ,",
    "the occupancy of each state is calculated : @xmath17 where it is clear that @xmath18 .",
    "the output @xmath19 of the network is the minority decision @xmath20    the game can also be represented by a feedforward network @xmath21 ( @xmath5 input units , @xmath1 hidden units and @xmath4 output ) . all units ( input , hidden , output ) are represented by @xmath0-states potts - spins .",
    "the weights @xmath7 are from the input units to the hidden units , and the weights from the hidden units to the output are all equal to @xmath22 .",
    "the dynamics of hidden and output units are similar to zero temperature dynamics of potts - spin systems @xcite , following the maximal induced field .",
    "the free parameters in our game are the @xmath23 weights , @xmath7 , from the input to the hidden units .",
    "their values will be determined by the strategy adopted by each one of the players .",
    "our local dynamic rules are based on the generalization of the on - line hebbian learning rule for @xmath24 @xcite to general @xmath0-states potts model with the following updating rule ; @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the learning rate and the sign @xmath27 indicates the next time step . note that all agents use the same rule for updating their strategy .",
    "the score of the game is determined similarly to the ising case .",
    "players belonging to the minority ( @xmath28 players ) gain @xmath29 , while the other @xmath30 players gain @xmath31 , where @xmath32 .",
    "note that in most previous works @xmath29 was chosen to be @xmath4 and @xmath31 was chosen to be either @xmath33 or @xmath22 .",
    "the global profit in such cases is @xmath34 it is clear that the maximization of the global profit @xmath35 is equivalent to the maximization of @xmath28 , which is bounded from above by @xmath36 .",
    "note that in the ising case each player belongs either to the minority or to the majority , where in the potts case the situation is more complex .",
    "the score may depend on the exact values of @xmath37 ( the score decreases with @xmath38 ) , hence the total profit @xmath39 .",
    "in such a case the maximization of the total profit may differ from the maximization of @xmath28 , and will be discussed briefly in the end of this paper .",
    "before we turn to discuss the guideline of the derivation of the results , which are more involved than for the ising case , let us present the main results : ( a ) the score and the dynamics are formulated analytically for general @xmath0 , the number of possible decisions .",
    "exact results are obtained for @xmath40 and asymptotically for @xmath41 .",
    "results for intermediate values of @xmath0 are obtained from simulations .",
    "( b ) a relaxation to the optimal score is achieved for small learning rates . ( c ) regarding the optimal case , the deviation of minority group size from @xmath36 is found to be non - monotonic with @xmath0 .",
    "( d ) the total score is independent of the size of the history ( @xmath5 , the size of the input ) available for the agents . ( e )",
    "all agents are using the same type of dynamic strategy and gain on average ( over time ) the same profit .",
    "our system does not undergo a phase transition to a state where the symmetry among the agents is broken into losers and winners @xcite . throughout the investigation of the game",
    "we assume that the memory size @xmath5 is larger than the number of players @xmath1 ( otherwise the completely symmetric potts configuration is geometrically impossible ) .",
    "albeit , simulations of the same dynamic for systems with @xmath42 show even better results for the global profit .",
    "in case where the maximization of the global profit @xmath35 is identical to the maximization of @xmath28 , the quantity of interest is @xmath43 where the symbol @xmath44 indicates an average over input patterns , and @xmath36 is the average number of players in each state .",
    "note that in our calculations the input vector presented to the players at each step of the game consists of random components@xcite , instead of the true history .",
    "nevertheless , simulations indicate that the system behavior is only slightly affected by the randomness of the inputs and the game properties remain similar .    for random players ,",
    "each weight ( among the @xmath23 weights @xmath7 ) is chosen from a given unbiased distribution and a variance @xmath45 .",
    "hence , the distribution of the overlap @xmath46 between weights belonging to any two players @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xmath49 is a gaussian with zero mean and variance @xmath45 . in the thermodynamic limit and for @xmath50",
    ", one can show that in the leading order the overlap between each pair is an independent random variable .",
    "for random players and @xmath24 one finds @xmath51 ; however , for general @xmath0 even the derivation of a similar quantity is non - trivial .",
    "the two cornerstones of the calculations below are the probability of a microscopic configuration @xmath52 , and the degeneracy @xmath53 of a macroscopic configuration @xmath54 , which is given by the multinomial coefficient : @xmath55 in the large @xmath1 limit , the typical deviation of the size of each group from @xmath36 is expected to scale with @xmath56 .",
    "hence we define : @xmath57 where it is clear that @xmath58 and without the loss of generality we assume @xmath59 . applying the stirling approximation to eq .",
    "( [ deg1 ] ) yields the degeneracy as a function of @xmath60 : @xmath61 if the average over @xmath62 , which we denote by @xmath46 , is @xmath33 , the agents make their choice independently and randomly , so each microscopic configuration has the same probability @xmath63 .",
    "now the average over @xmath64 can be evaluated : @xmath65 the quantity @xmath66 was calculated numerically for @xmath67 and found to be equal to @xmath68 , respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "results obtained from simulations with @xmath69 and @xmath70 are in an excellent agreement with eq .",
    "( [ epsmin ] ) . for @xmath71 the reported results in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] were derived only from simulations and are in an excellent agreement with the asymptotic behavior of eq .",
    "( [ epsmin ] ) , @xmath72 .",
    "another quantity of interest is the average deviation of the average number of players in each state from @xmath36 , @xmath73 .",
    "similarly to eq .",
    "( [ epsmin ] ) , this quantity can be derived analytically and gives @xmath74",
    "so far we have compared @xmath75 and @xmath76 for random players , where the average overlap is zero . without breaking the symmetry among the players ,",
    "the weights can be represented by @xmath1 weight vectors which are symmetrically spread around their center of mass .",
    "more precisely , we denote the weight vector of the @xmath6th perceptron as @xmath77 , and assume that it can be expressed as @xmath78 where the center of mass @xmath79 , and @xmath80 are @xmath1 unit vectors of rank @xmath5 obeying the symmetry @xmath81 hence , the total profit and @xmath28 are functions of only one parameter , @xmath82 .",
    "it is clear that the maximization of the total profit or @xmath28 ( as for the case @xmath24 ) is obtained when @xmath83 , which is the maximal achievable homogeneous repulsion among @xmath1 vectors of rank @xmath84 .",
    "the repulsion is the natural tendency of each player in the minority game , since the goal is to act differently than other players . without a cooperation which breaks the players into sub - groups ,",
    "the maximal homogeneous repulsion is @xmath85 .",
    "the two questions of interest are the following : ( a ) what is @xmath86 and @xmath75 as a function of @xmath0 for the optimal solution , @xmath83 and @xmath85 ?",
    "( b ) is the optimal solution achievable by local dynamic rules for each one of the players ?",
    "we first examine the former question regarding the optimal solution , and then we turn to study the dynamic behavior of the players .",
    "the average deviation of the number of players in each state from @xmath36 at @xmath83 and for @xmath87 can be calculated analytically .",
    "the main idea is that this quantity can be calculated similarly to eq .",
    "( [ epsmin ] ) , or via @xmath88 .",
    "the simplification of the later expression is such that an average over only a pair of players has to be done .",
    "the result as a function of @xmath0 gives @xmath89 where @xmath90 ^ 2 $ ] and @xmath91 .",
    "regarding the optimal score , the quantity of a particular interest is @xmath92 .",
    "this quantity has to be compared with @xmath93 in order to estimate the improvement in the average global gain relative to the random case .",
    "note that the calculation of eq .",
    "( [ epsmin ] ) for @xmath94 is nontrivial since @xmath95 is no longer independent of the configuration @xmath96 .",
    "however , we can overcome this difficulty in the following way . for @xmath87",
    "one can show that in the leading order @xmath97 has the same form as @xmath98 : @xmath99 where the exact value of @xmath100 is unknown .",
    "the observation that both @xmath97 and @xmath98 have the same dependence on @xmath101 ( eqs .",
    "( [ deg2 ] ) and ( [ pkeps ] ) ) indicates that the ratio @xmath102 is independent of @xmath46 if @xmath87 , and in particular : @xmath103 this property can be easily derived by rescaling @xmath104 in the integral representation ( eq .",
    "( [ epsmin ] ) ) of each one of the four terms in eq .",
    "( [ ratio ] ) .",
    "the same prefactor appears both in the denominator and in the numerator , and the dependence of @xmath105 on @xmath46 via @xmath100 is cancelled out .",
    "( [ ratio ] ) , @xmath106 can be obtained indirectly from the knowledge of the other three terms , which are given by eqs .",
    "( [ epsmin ] ) , ( [ epssqr ] ) , and ( [ epssqrr ] ) .",
    "results for @xmath106 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in order to confirm our analytical results we performed simulations for the optimal case , eqs .",
    "( [ epssqrr ] ) and ( [ ratio ] ) , with @xmath83 .",
    "the simulations were done in two stages . in the first stage , @xmath1 normalized vectors of rank @xmath5 , obeying the constraints that the overlap among each pair is equal to @xmath107 , are generated using a recursive process .",
    "the details of the algorithm will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "in the second stage , @xmath75 and @xmath76 were averaged over about @xmath108 randomly chosen inputs for a system with @xmath109 and @xmath110 . an excellent agreement between simulations and analytical results",
    "was obtained ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the improvement in the global gain can be measured by the ratio @xmath111 .",
    "this ratio decreases monotonically with @xmath0 such that its maximal value @xmath112 and for @xmath113 @xmath114 ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "so far we derived the properties of the optimal solution for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "now we are turning to the second question : is the optimal solution achievable by local dynamic rules ( eq .",
    "( [ update ] ) ) ?",
    "after averaging eq .",
    "( [ update ] ) over @xmath115 and in the limit where the number of examples , @xmath116 , scales with the number of input units @xmath5 , one can find the following equation of motion for the center of mass @xmath117 where @xmath44 denotes an average over the random examples . for large @xmath5 , in the leading order",
    "each input vector divides each weight vector into @xmath0 equal groups of size @xmath118 .",
    "the minority state is the one whose group of weights gives the minimal sum . using eq .",

    "these @xmath118 quantities are random variables with zero mean and variance @xmath122 ( @xmath123 and @xmath124 ) .",
    "one can find that @xmath125 is equal to @xmath126^{k-2}dy .",
    "\\label{cavg}\\ ] ]    hence , for a given @xmath0 , eqs .",
    "( [ cfix ] ) and ( [ cavg ] ) indicate a linear relation between the fixed point value of @xmath82 and the learning rate @xmath26 with corrections of @xmath127 .",
    "as @xmath128 , @xmath129 and the system approaches the optimal configuration .",
    "the interplay between @xmath82 and @xmath26 was confirmed by simulations , where finite size effects decay as the size of the system becomes larger .",
    "this effect is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for @xmath130 .",
    "the explicit dependence of @xmath131 on @xmath82 can be found for @xmath132 via the relation @xmath133 results of simulations for @xmath134 as a function of @xmath82 for @xmath135 and @xmath136 are presented in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . an excellent agreement between the analytical prediction and simulations",
    "was obtained in the regime of @xmath137 ( corresponding to @xmath132 ) .",
    "note that although the global gain @xmath35 which corresponds to the boolean case is monotonic with @xmath0 , the non - monotonic behavior of @xmath138 implies that for non - boolean cases non - monotonic behavior of @xmath35 may be obtained .",
    "in this paper we introduced a generalization of the minority game to the case of multi - choice .",
    "the problem was applied to a multilayer network with updating rules for the weights ( strategies ) .",
    "static and dynamic properties of the strategies were solved analytically for various @xmath0 s and were found to be in a good agreement with simulations on finite systems .",
    "this modification of the minority game to the case of multi - choice open a manifold of new questions , which certainly deserve future research .",
    "we have chosen two of those questions to briefly discuss here .",
    "firstly , as we have pointed out before , the function according to which the profit is awarded is not necessarily boolean as in eq .",
    "( [ profit ] ) .",
    "in fact , the model is more realistic when the profit of a player is related to the size of his group , as well as to the size of the other groups @xcite .",
    "our analysis can be applied to these cases if the maximization of the global gain is equivalent to the maximization of the minority group . however",
    ", other scores may not fulfill this required condition . in these cases",
    ", it has to be determined whether the optimal symmetric configuration remains the maximal repulsion .",
    "secondly , the other strategies for the minority game that have been studied can be generalized to multi - choice situations in a straightforward manner : in the original game @xcite where each player has several decision tables , each table entry is now a value between @xmath4 and @xmath0 . in johnson s stochastic strategy @xcite",
    ", each player has a probability of choosing the outcome that was successful the last time , or to pick one of the others with equal probability . in the strategy of reents @xcite",
    ", players who were not in the minority could switch to some other action with a small probability in the next time step .",
    "similarly , other conceivable strategies can also be generalized .",
    "preliminary checks imply that all these modified strategies show similar behavior compared to that of the binary - choice game , even though their theoretical treatment probably becomes more involved . while outcomes of these games certainly have to be measured against the reference",
    "values given in eqs .",
    "( 12 ) and ( 13 ) , it is not clear under what circumstances relations like eq . ( 18 ) hold for other strategies .",
