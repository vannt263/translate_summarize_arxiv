    "over the last twenty five years or so , entangled quantum states shared between distant parties have been proved to be essential for several quantum protocols @xcite .",
    "however , unavoidable destruction of quantum coherence due to noisy quantum channels diminishes the quality of the shared quantum state , thereby posing a challenge to the implementation of such protocols .",
    "invention of distillation protocols @xcite to purify highly entangled states from collection of states with relatively low entanglement has been proven crucial in order to overcome such difficulties in device independent quantum cryptography @xcite , quantum dense coding @xcite , and quantum teleportation @xcite - the three pillars of quantum communication .",
    "entanglement distillation is also indispensable in quantum repeater models @xcite , used to overcome the exponential scaling of the error probabilities with the length of the noisy quantum channel connecting distant parties sharing the quantum state .",
    "existence of bound entangled ( be ) states @xcite - entangled states from which no pure entangled state can be obtained using local operations and classical communications ( locc ) - further highlights the importance of identifying distillable states .",
    "entanglement distillation protocols have also been used in problems related to topological quantum memory @xcite .",
    "laboratory realization of single copy distillation has been performed and possible experimental proposal of multicopy distillation has been given @xcite .",
    "there is a close correspondence between entanglement and energy @xcite .",
    "moreover , consideration of statistical ensembles of quantum states of a system in terms of various constraints on its energy and number of particles is crucial in several areas of physics , including in quantum communication .",
    "an important example is the classical capacity of a noiseless quantum channel @xcite for transmitting classical information using quantum states .",
    "the classical capacity is quantified by the von neumann entropy of the maximally mixed quantum state that can be sent through the noiseless quantum channel .",
    "the holevo bound@xcite dictates that at most @xmath0 bits of classical information can be transmitted using @xmath0 distinguishable qubits , thereby predicting an infinite capacity for infinite dimensional systems , such as the bosonic channels @xcite .",
    "since the energy required to achieve infinite capacity is also infinite , such non - physicality can be taken care of by calculating the capacity under appropriate energy constraints .",
    "constraints on available energy can also be active in other quantum information protocols including infinite- as well as finite - dimensional systems and in particular may give rise to a novel understanding of the interplay between entanglement and energy .",
    "for example , to implement ideas like quantum repeaters for long - distance quantum state distribution , an energy - constrained protocol for the distillation of entanglement may be necessary . evidently , in that case , the energy of the states involved in the distillation process must follow constraints according to the physical situation in hand .",
    "the logical choice of such constraints may include bounds on average energy , or maximum available energy of the quantum states .",
    "in this paper , we consider the process of distillation of highly entangled quantum states of shared systems from weakly entangled ones within the realm of limited resources .",
    "specifically , we propose that a distillation protocol have to be carried out under an energy constraint , and refer to it as canonicaldistillation .",
    "we prove that non - interacting hamiltonians lead to situations where canonically distillable states form a set of measure zero .",
    "the situation , however , drastically changes with the inclusion of interaction terms .",
    "we consider several paradigmatic interacting hamiltonians of spin-@xmath1 systems , viz .",
    "the transverse - field @xmath2 model @xcite , the longitudinal - field @xmath2 model , and the @xmath3 model in an applied field @xcite , and the concept of canonical distillation is probed in each case .",
    "the interrelation between canonical distillability and the temperature in thermal states is also investigated .",
    "the findings are generic in the sense that they hold also in higher dimensions and for higher number of parties . the energy constraint in these cases",
    "is introduced by respectively considering a bilinear - biquadratic hamiltonian @xcite of two spin-@xmath4 particles and a multisite transverse @xmath2 model .",

    "such dissipative channels can be incorporated into the definition , but leads to further intractability in the analysis .",
    "also , the average energy constraint can be replaced by a maximal available energy constraint , wherein we expect the broad qualitative features , of the case where the average energy is considered , to be retained .",

    "one must note that for the two - qubit systems , @xmath28 just like @xmath29 , determination of @xmath25 under the canonical energy constraint is a difficult problem .",

    "<S> distilling highly entangled quantum states from weaker ones is a process that is crucial for efficient and long - distance quantum communication , and has implications for several other quantum information protocols . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the notion of distillation under limited resources , and specifically focus on the energy constraint . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding protocol , which we call the canonical distillation of entanglement , naturally leads to the set of canonically distillable states . </S>",
    "<S> we show that for non - interacting hamiltonians , almost no states are canonically distillable , while the situation can be drastically different for interacting ones . </S>",
    "<S> several paradigmatic hamiltonians are considered for bipartite as well as multipartite canonical distillability . </S>",
    "<S> the results have potential applications for practical quantum communication devices . </S>"
