    "the present observations from wmap seven - year cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation measurements @xcite , large - scale structure surveys @xcite , and updated type ia supernovae ( snia ) @xcite have confirmed at a high confidence level the first implication from snia in 1998 @xcite that our universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion .",
    "it has been an important issue of modern cosmology to unveil the mysterious face of the driving force of current accelerated expansion .",
    "one of the theoretical viewpoints is that dark energy with negative pressure drives current expansion .",
    "a flood of dark energy models have been proposed , such as a natural cosmological constant ( @xmath0cdm model ) , dynamical dark energy models with scalar fields @xcite or with exotic equation of state @xcite , and so on .",
    "please see @xcite for an up - to - date review on dark energy .",
    "although the cosmological constant model keeps a good fit to the current observations , it suffers from the fine - tuning problem and the cosmic coincidence problem . in the final analysis ,",
    "both are related to the energy density of vacuum energy .",
    "therefore , the cosmological constant problem is in essence an issue of quantum gravity . before the complete theory of quantum gravity",
    "is established , the dark energy model on the basis of the holographic principle of quantum gravity theory was built in ref .",
    "@xcite by applying the energy bound proposed by cohen , kaplan , and nelson @xcite to cosmology .",
    "namely , for a system with size @xmath1 and uv cutoff @xmath0 without decaying into a black hole , it is required that the total energy in a region of size @xmath1 should not exceed the mass of a black hole of the same size ; thus @xmath2 .",
    "it reveals a duality between the uv cutoff and ir cutoff . in cosmology , the uv cutoff is related to the dark energy density , and the ir cutoff is related to the large scale of the universe .",
    "the holographic dark energy models with different ir cutoffs have been studied and the detailed discussions can be seen in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , gao , chen , and shen first proposed that dark energy density is in direct proportion to the ricci scalar curvature , @xmath3 , and referred to this as the ricci dark energy ( rde ) model .",
    "the distinct characteristic of the rde model is that the cosmic coincidence problem and causality problem can be naturally solved .",
    "however , the physical motivation for such a model was vague in ref .",
    "subsequently , cai , hu , and zhang @xcite were inspired by the motivation of the causal entropy bound in the framework of holography , found the causal connection scale , @xmath4 , and put forward an appropriate physical mechanism for this model . in @xcite , it was pointed out that the scale on which the black hole can be formed must be within @xmath4 , which is set by the `` jeans '' length of the perturbations to @xmath5 , while one assumes a black hole in the universe is formed by gravitational collapse of perturbations of cosmological spacetime .",
    "only if one takes the causal connection scale with @xmath6 as the ir cutoff , can the dark energy model be consistent with current observations @xcite .",
    "it is found that @xmath7 @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the rde is stressed to be the holographic dark energy with the ir cutoff of the causal connection scale .",
    "the rde density reads @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the reduced planck mass @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the dimensionless parameter and has been constrained by using the distance measurements from different joint observations @xcite . in particular , in these studies , the compressed cmb information is used , including the `` shift parameter , '' the `` acoustic scale , '' and the photon decoupling epoch , the values of which are obtained on the basis of a given model in advance @xcite .",
    "that is to say , before these distance parameters are used to constrain a model , one should renew to get their values basing on the constrained model . in this paper",
    ", we revisit the cosmological parameters in the rde model by using the full cmb power spectrum data from wmap7 and additional distance measurements from baryon acoustic oscillations ( baos ) and union2 snia including 557 data points .",
    "compared with the previous works , we not only focus on the constraint of background evolution , but also take dark energy perturbations into account . for there will be dark energy perturbations according to the perturbed conservation equations when the dark energy is not a cosmological constant .",
    "what is more , the perturbations of dark energy play an important role when the dark energy model is confronted with the current observations @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of dark energy perturbations leaves an imprint on the cmb power spectrum @xcite and leads to the changes of parameters spaces in the complete fitting to observational data @xcite .",
    "in particular , there are the significant changes on the large - scale cmb power spectra by the late integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect @xcite , which arises from a time - dependent gravitational potential when dark energy dominates in the universe at late time for a flat dark energy model .",
    "the magnitude of the isw - power spectrum is dependent on dark energy models and dark energy perturbations @xcite .",
    "therefore , a complete constraint on the rde model with perturbations is performed by employing the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we review the background equations for the rde model and the perturbation equations in the conformal newtonian gauge . in sec .",
    "iii , we perform a global fitting to observational data by using the mcmc method and discuss the constraint results . the last section is the conclusion .",
    "first of all , we give a brief review on the background evolution of the rde model in the framework of the unperturbed and spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker metric .",
    "the einstein field equation is written as @xmath12 where the energy density of rde , @xmath13 , is rewritten with the variable @xmath14 as @xmath15    after using the dimensionless definitions @xmath16 and @xmath17 we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : fried ] ) as    @xmath18    the solution of this first order differential equation with the initial condition @xmath19 is obtained : @xmath20 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rhor],[eq : e2 ] ) , we can get the dimensionless energy density of rde @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the present value of the dimensionless energy density of rde .",
    "then the corresponding equation of state ( eos ) of rde is obtained by the conservation equation @xmath23    when the eos of dark energy is not constantly equal to -1 , it is necessary to consider dark energy perturbations .",
    "we work in the conformal newtonian gauge , the perturbed metric being @xmath24 the perturbed conservation equations of dark energy perturbations @xcite read @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the energy density perturbation , and @xmath27 is the velocity divergence perturbation and is related to the velocity by @xmath28@xcite . where the primes denote the derivatives with respect to conformal time @xmath29",
    ", @xmath30 is the conformal hubble function and @xmath31 is the general sound speed , being defined as @xmath32 from the intrinsic entropy perturbation @xmath33 @xcite , @xmath34 where the adiabatic speed of sound , @xmath35 , is purely determined by the eos , @xmath36 it is found that only in the rest frame where @xmath26 keeps gauge invariant can the general sound speed be a gauge invariant quantity since @xmath33 and @xmath35 are gauge and scale independent .",
    "the following transformation gives the useful relation between the gauge invariant , rest frame density perturbation , @xmath37 , the density and velocity divergence perturbations in a general frame , @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xcite : @xmath38 thus we can express the pressure perturbation in a general frame , @xmath39 , in terms of the general sound speed in the rest frame , @xmath40 , by using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gamma],[eq : delta ] ) @xmath41 using the above equation and eq .",
    "( [ eq : ca ] ) , we have @xmath42",
    "in the process of performing the observational constraints on cosmological parameters , we adopt the mcmc method by working with the publicly available * cosmomc * package @xcite , including the * camb * @xcite code of calculating the theoretical cmb power spectrum .",
    "we modified the code for the rde model with dark energy perturbations .",
    "in the first instance , work including perturbations of dark energy with eos on either side of the cosmological constant boundary , i.e. , @xmath43 or @xmath44 , was studied @xcite . in this case",
    ", the perturbed equations of dark energy can be solved well . however , when one encounters the perturbations of dark energy with eos crossing the cosmological constant boundary -1 , there inevitably exists a divergent problem due to the term @xmath45 in the denominator in eq.([eq : theta ] ) .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , rde behaves like a `` quintom '' when @xmath46 . here",
    ", we use the method proposed in @xcite , dividing the whole range of @xmath47 into three regions with a small positive parameter @xmath48 : ( 1 ) @xmath49 ; ( 2 ) @xmath50 ; and ( 3 ) @xmath51 . equations ( [ eq : delta2],[eq",
    ": theta ] ) are well satisfied in regions ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "the divergence happens in region ( 2 ) . in order to deal with the divergence and",
    "keep dark energy perturbations continuous , the perturbations in region ( 2 ) are set as follows @xcite : @xmath52 while in the process of running the program , we set @xmath53 , which is within the limited range , @xmath54@xcite . by using the method , refs .",
    "@xcite gave the global fittings on the quintomlike dark energy with parametrized eos when the dark energy perturbations were included .",
    "we adopt the following seven - dimensional cosmological spaces : @xmath55)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the physical baryon and cold dark matter densities , @xmath58 is the ratio ( multiplied by 100 ) of the sound horizon and angular diameter distance , @xmath59 is the optical depth , @xmath11 is the newly added ricci parameter , @xmath60 is the scalar spectral index , and @xmath61 is defined as the amplitude of the initial power spectrum .",
    "the pivot scale of the initial scalar power spectrum we have used is @xmath62 .",
    "the corresponding priors are taken as follows : @xmath63 $ ] , @xmath64 $ ] , @xmath65 $ ] , @xmath66 $ ] , @xmath67 $ ] , @xmath68 $ ] , and @xmath69\\in[2.7,4]$ ] .",
    "in addition , we use a top - hat prior of the cosmic age , i.e. , @xmath70 , impose a weak gaussian prior on the physical baryon density @xmath71 from big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite , and use the new value of the hubble constant @xmath72 @xcite by a gaussian likelihood function .    in our calculations",
    ", we have taken the total likelihood @xmath73 to be the products of the separate likelihoods of cmb , baos , and snia .",
    "thus we have @xmath74 the full cmb data are used , including the new temperature and polarization power spectra from wmap seven - year data @xcite .",
    "we combine the additional distance measurements from baos and snia . for bao information",
    ", we use the values of @xmath75 $ ] and their inverse covariance matrix @xcite . for snia",
    ", we use the 557 union2 snia data with systematic errors @xcite . in order to assess the goodness of fit between the rde model and @xmath0cdm model on the basis of the same observational data",
    ", we also perform the best fitting to the wmap+bao+snia data sets in the @xmath0cdm model .      in this section ,",
    "we first present the constraint results from observational data . then using the fitting results",
    ", we investigate the imprints on cmb temperature anisotropy , background evolution , and evolutions of perturbations for the rde model with perturbations .",
    "the constraint results of full basic parameters and derived parameters are showed in table [ tab : results ] , where we list the mean values with @xmath76 regions and best - fit values from wmap alone in the rde model , wmap+bao+snia in the rde model , and wmap+bao+snia in the @xmath0cdm model , respectively .",
    "it is seen that the inclusion of distance information from baos and snia leads to a significant change for best - fit value of parameter @xmath11 .",
    "both the best - fit values of the scalar spectral index , @xmath60 , in the rde model are greater than 1 .",
    "that is to say , the scalar spectrum is `` blue '' tilted .",
    "this result is different from that in the @xmath0cdm model , where within @xmath77 regions the initial power spectrum with a blue tilt is not favored .",
    "for the combined constraint , the total best - fit @xmath78 of the rde model is 8056.1 , while @xmath79 for the best - fit @xmath0cdm model .",

    "it is found that there are significant discrepancies of cmb temperature power spectra in the two models on large angular scales , where the contribution to the secondary cmb temperature power spectrum is mainly from the late isw effect .",

    "we consider that this effect can be viewed as coming from the different effective matter densities based on the same expansion rate , i.e. , @xmath84 .",
    "so there is a lower effective matter density with the increase in @xmath11 .",
    "the lower effective matter density causes the delay of the epoch of matter - radiation equality , i.e. , the smaller @xmath85 .",
