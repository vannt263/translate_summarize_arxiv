    "of coupled dynamical systems have been widely studied over the past decades @xcite-@xcite , which can be characterized by that all oscillators approach to a uniform dynamical behavior and generally assured by the couplings among nodes and/or external distributed and cooperative control .    in most existing works on linearly coupled dynamical systems , each node needs to gather its own state and neighbors states and update them spontaneously or in a fixed sampling rate , which may cost much . in order to reduce the sampling rate of the coupling between nodes , specific",
    "discretization is necessary .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , event - based sampling was proved to possess better performance than sampling periodically in time .",
    "hence , @xcite-@xcite suggested that the event - based control algorithms to reduce communication and computation load in networked coupled systems .",
    "and @xcite-@xcite showed that the event - based control maintains the control performance .",
    "event - based control seems to be suitable for coupled dynamical systems with limited resources and many works addressed the event - triggered algorithms .",

    "@xcite-@xcite studied the stochastic event - driven strategies . @xcite introduced event - based control strategies for both networks of single - integrators with time - delay in communication links and networks of double - integrators . by using scattering transformation , @xcite investigated the output synchronization problem of multi - agent systems with event - driven communication in the presence of constant communication delays . in some cases , event - driven strategies for multi - agent systems can be regarded as linearization and discretization process . for example , as mentioned in @xcite , the following algorithm @xmath0 can be a variant of the event triggering ( distributed , self triggered ) model for consensus problem . in centralized control ,",
    "the bound for @xmath1 to reach synchronization was given in the paper @xcite when the coupling graph is indirected and in @xcite for the directed coupling graph .",
    "motivated by these works ,",
    "we apply the idea of event - triggered sampling scheme to the coupling configurations to realize synchronization of linearly coupled dynamical systems . here , for each node , the coupling term is set up from the information of its local neighborhood at the last event time and the event is triggered by some criteria derived from the information of its local neighborhood .",
    "that is , once the triggering rule of node is satisfied , the coupling term of this node is updated .",
    "thus , the coupling terms are piece - wise constant between two neighboring event times .",
    "we consider two scenarios : continuous monitoring and discrete monitoring .",
    "continuous monitoring means that each node can observe its neighborhood s instantaneous information , but discrete monitoring means that each node can only obtain the its neighborhood s information at this event triggered time . as a payoff for small cost of discrete monitoring",
    ", the triggering events happen more frequently than continuous - time monitoring .",
    "for each scenario , it is shown that the proposed event - triggered strategies guarantee the performances of the nominal systems .",
