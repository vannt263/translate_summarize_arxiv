    "bell s theorem has revealed that local variable theories can not reproduce all statistical predictions of quantum theory , and highlights the statistical incompatibility between classical local variable theories and quantum theory @xcite .",
    "when the bell - type inequalities are violated , non - locality appears .",
    "however , even if the observations on a given system of particle pairs exhibit non - locality , it does not necessarily imply that all individual pairs in the system behave non - locally . it may be possible that some fraction of the pairs behave non - locally , while the other pairs behave locally .",
    "this issue has been investigated carefully first by elitzur , popescu , and rohrlich ( to be referred to as epr2 ) @xcite in terms of the local contents in a given non - local correlation . since then , several authors generalized and further discussed the idea @xcite .",
    "for example , epr2 approach has been related to another noticeable question , the simulation of quantum correlations with other resource , which has been proved useful in the task of simulating entanglement @xcite .",
    "@xcite gave an upper bound of the weight of local component in @xmath2 system .",

    "_ @xcite extended this lower bound to the mixed two - qubit states . in @xcite ,",
    "a new epr2 decomposition has been given , which can make their local content reach the upper bound in a wide range of two - qubit pure states .",

    "we first examine general requirements for optimization of the weight of the local part in a convex decomposition of a given quantum distribution into local and non - local part .",
    "guided by the requirements , we suggest local probability distributions for @xmath0-qubit ghz states , which gives the lower bound of the local contents of such states , in section  [ paper::sec:3 ] .",
    "our result for @xmath1 reproduces the lower bound in @xcite .",
    "it is also noted that the lower bound on the local content decreases rapidly with @xmath0 . in section  [ paper::sec:6 ] , we briefly discuss the upper bound based on bell - type inequalities .",

    "the form of the distribution in leads to a set of constraints on the joint distributions ( bell - type inequalities ) for any fixed number of measurements on each party .",
    "if there exist joint probability distributions that violates the inequalities , they would not be written as , and are thus non - local .",
