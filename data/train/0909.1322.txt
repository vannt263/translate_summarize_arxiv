    "it is now generally accepted that neutrinos have small masses , and a phenomenology of neutrino oscillations within the framework of massive neutrino mixings is by now well developed .",
    "however , the nature of the neutrino  whether it is a dirac or majorana particle  and thus the origin of neutrino masses remains unknown .",
    "much of the vast literature on the origin of neutrino masses invokes the see - saw mechanism , and so focuses on models of majorana neutrinos .",
    "since left - handed ( lh ) leptons in the sm are charged under @xmath1 , only singlet right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos can take on tree level majorana masses . to forbid such mass terms",
    ", rh neutrinos are required to carry internal charges , and these are usually assumed to arise from a @xmath2 symmetry  be it global or gauged  that is commonly identify as the lepton number . a massive dirac neutrino can then arise if lh leptons carry the appropriate charges that allow yukawa couplings to rh neutrinos and the higgs boson .",
    "note that the internal symmetry need not be a @xmath2 symmetry , although it is usually implicitly assumed .",
    "indeed , it has long been known that discrete symmetries can lead to dirac neutrinos .",
    "these models are typically constructed within the context of supersymmetric models , where the low - scale discrete symmetries come as remnants of some broken high - scale gauge symmetry , and are to be understood as gauged discrete symmetries  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the viability of dirac neutrinos in the context of warped randall - sundrum ( rs ) extra - dimensional scenario  @xcite .",
    "this is a departure from previous studies , which aim at incorporating the see - saw mechanism in the rs scenario  .",
    "recent studies have shown that the rs scenario provides a novel and powerful framework to understand flavour physics ( see e.g.  @xcite and references within ) .",
    "the crucial point is that the observed sm charged fermion mass hierarchy can be naturally produced from their `` geography '' in the five - dimensional ( 5d ) @xmath3 bulk  @xcite , which also solves the electroweak hierarchy problem  @xcite .",
    "the fermion mass hierarchy now arises from the overlap of fermion wavefunctions in the bulk , whose form is determined by the @xmath3 geometry , and whose location given by the fermion bulk mass ( or localization ) parameters . neither these nor the yukawa couplings need be fine - tuned , and yukawa couplings can be naturally of order one with a completely random pattern , i.e. `` anarchic ''  @xcite .",
    "indeed , from this approach , the observed quark mass and mixing patterns can be accurately reproduced  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to expect that dirac neutrinos can have naturally small masses without fine - tuning from the appropriate localization of neutrinos in the bulk , which we find is indeed the case .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the usual 4d dirac neutrino models where excessive fine - tuning is often required .    for the framework of our study",
    ", we choose the minimal custodial rs ( mcrs ) model first given in  @xcite .",
    "the mcrs model has @xmath4 as its bulk gauge group , which encodes a custodial @xmath5 symmetry that protects the @xmath6 parameter from excessive corrections due to kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations of the bulk fields .",
    "matter fields reside in the bulk , and the sm chiral fermions are idendified as the zero - modes of bulk fermion fields .",
    "this set - up is fully realistic and satisfies all constraints from precision electroweak precision tests ( ewpts ) . to have dirac type active neutrinos , we forbid majorana mass terms for the rh neutrino zero - modes by a discrete @xmath7 symmetry obtained via the krauss - wilczek ( kw ) mechanism  @xcite from a gauged @xmath2 symmetry in the bulk . in this paper",
    ", we will focus on the simplest case where we augment the mcrs bulk gauge group by an additional @xmath8   can also be used to suppress proton decay . a mechanism for doing",
    "so is discussed in  @xcite . ] .",
    "the kw mechanism can then be implemented straightforwardly with the help of uv localized boundary higgs .    as small neutrino masses",
    "can be obtained naturally through neutrino geography , the challenge then is to accommodate the large neutrino mixings , which is very different from quark mixings .",
    "one would also like to achieve all these at a scale relevant for the lhc .",
    "for the mcrs model , ewpts set the scale of kk resonances at around 3  tev  @xcite .",
    "however , flavour changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes resulting from the anarchic 5d flavour structure generally push the kk scale up beyond the reach of the lhc , particularly in the quark sector where fcnc constraints are severe  @xcite . to bring the kk scale down to a few tev order ,",
    "additional flavour symmetries have been proposed ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . in the lepton sector , which we concentrate on in this paper , the flavour constraints on the kk scale is less severe . with some tuning in the yukawa couplings",
    ", we find that for the normal hierarchy , the observed neutrino mass spectrum and mixing pattern can be reproduced very well within the mcrs set - up with the kk scale at the 3  tev level ; fitting for the case of inverted hierarchy or degenerate neutrinos requires either excessive fine - tuning or a much higher kk scale , or both .",
    "alternative approaches include imposing an additional lepton flavour symmetry ( see e.g.  @xcite ) or lepton minimal flavour violation ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "an interesting fact from our set - up is that there are generically rh kk neutrinos with mass in the range of @xmath9  gev .",
    "this follows from the localization of charged leptons necessary to reproduce charged lepton masses",

    "this gives the mass matrices for the sm fermions in the 4d effective theory @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",

    "the mass matrices are diagonalized by a bi - unitary transformation @xmath57 where @xmath58 are the mass eigenvalues , and the mass eigenbasis is defined by @xmath59 .",
    "then for quarks , the ckm matrix is given by @xmath60 , while for leptons , the pmns matrix is given by @xmath61 .      in order to have dirac neutrinos , majorana mass terms from @xmath62 have to be forbidden .",
    "a simple way to do this is to have an additional @xmath2 symmetry . because quantum gravity effects do not respect global symmetries  @xcite , this @xmath2 has to be gauged .",
    "but gauged symmetry has to be broken , as otherwise new massless gauge boson would appear .",
    "nevertheless , through kw mechanism a gauged discrete @xmath7 symmetry can remain after breaking the @xmath2 gauge symmetry on the uv brane ( see below ) , and so majorana neutrino mass terms stay forbidden .    to implement the kw mechanism , we extend the mcrs bulk gauge group by an additional @xmath8 .",
    "this is then broken spontaneously on the uv brane via a uv brane - localized scalar , @xmath63 .",
    "the covariant derivative of @xmath63 is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the @xmath8 gauge field , and @xmath66 the gauge coupling constant .",
    "after spontaneous symmetry breaking @xmath63 acquires a vev , @xmath67 , and it can be parametrized as @xmath68 .",
    "the goldstone field , @xmath69 , can be removed by a gauge transformation accompanied by a concomitant redefinition of the fermion field : @xmath70 the @xmath7 symmetry then emerges from the @xmath8 symmetry if @xmath71 , the fermion charge under the @xmath8 , is rational but nonintegral .",
    "as is reviewed in appendix  [ app:4ddn ] , the usual results for dirac neutrinos in 4d  where a @xmath7 is put in by hand  can be carried over , and the smallest group is @xmath72 .",
    "we assume that ir localized higgs fields , @xmath73 , are singlets under the @xmath7 , so the gauged discrete symmetry is exact in the 4d effective theory .",
    "interestingly , the discrete charge also forbids neutrinoless double beta , @xmath74 , decays in nuclei .",
    "the reason is that if the sm fermions carry any charges , @xmath75 , other than the sm gauge charges , @xmath74 decays must satisfy the following condition : @xmath76 where @xmath77 labels the fermion chirality .",
    "this is trivially satisifed in models of majorana neutrinos . in our case of dirac neutrinos from a discrete symmetry",
    ", we have @xmath78 independent of the chiralities of the quarks , and also @xmath79 ( see eq .  ) .",
    ".   is not satified , and @xmath74 decays are forbidden .",
    "note that assigning a lepton number for both lh and rh electrons using a @xmath2 symmetry , as is commonly done , will also _ not _ satify eq .  .",
    "as a consequence , @xmath74 decays in nuclei can not be used to determine whether dirac neutrinos arise from a continuous symmetry , such as a @xmath80 lepton number , or a discrete @xmath7 symmetry as in our model .",
    "we reiterate and emphasize here that eq .",
    "is a model - independent sum rule for any hidden charges that the sm fermions may carry , and so provides a more model independent way of looking at the @xmath74 experiments .",
    "in the lepton sector , it is a particular challenge for scenarios with dirac neutrinos to naturally explain the bi - large mixing pattern observed in neutrinos , the lepton masses , and simultaneously suppress lepton flavour violations ( lfvs ) with a scale that is not high ( of a few tev order ) .",

    "searching for the lepton localization parameters needs more guidelines .",
    "electroweak constraints from the @xmath87 branching ratios require @xmath88 and @xmath89  @xcite .",
    "next , since we assume anarchic yukawa couplings , mixing angles essentially depend on the ratio of lepton wavefunctions .",
    "the bi - large mixing pattern then indicates that lh charged leptons have similar wavefunctions , and thus similar @xmath81 s .",
    "once the @xmath81 s are given , the range of the rh lepton localizations are then set by the lepton masses .    for charged leptons , in order to reproduce the mass pattern we require the eigenvalues of the charged lepton mass matrices to be within @xmath90 error of the values given in  @xcite at the 1  tev scale .",
    "constraints from lfvs also need to taken into account , and we require the our configurations be such that @xmath91 and @xmath92 hold  -@xmath93 conversion do not place further constraints on the viable mass matrices once that from @xmath94 are satisfied .",

    "we review here how dirac neutrinos are commonly implemented in 4d gauge theories with a @xmath7 extension to the sm gauge group . for simplicity , we consider here the case of just one generation of fermions species : @xmath203 , @xmath204 , @xmath205 , @xmath206 , @xmath207 , and a rh neutrino @xmath208 .",
    "generalization to three generations is straightforward , and does not alter the physics .    under the @xmath7 symmetry ,",
    "fermion fields transform as @xmath209 where @xmath210 is the discrete charge of @xmath211 . for @xmath7 to remain unbroken , the sm higgs is required to be a singlet under the @xmath7 , i.e. @xmath212 .",
    "to have quark and charged lepton masses , we have the following constraints : @xmath213 to have a massive dirac neutrino , we further require @xmath214 this constraint forbids a majorana mass term in the neutrino mass matrix and immediately rules out @xmath215 as a viable discrete symmetry .",
    "we see that the dimension five operator , @xmath216 , is automatically forbidden .",
    "there are many solutions that satisfy all the constraints above .",
    "one such solution is @xmath217 in this case , the discrete group is @xmath72 , which is also the smallest . interestingly ,",
    "gauge invariant dimension six operators @xmath218 are all forbidden .",
    "the superscript above denotes charge conjugation , and for simplicity we have dropped the fermion chirality label . on the other hand , dimension nine operators which cause neutron anti - neutron oscillations are allowed by the @xmath72 .",
    "however , this can be suppressed by have a @xmath219 symmetry instead .",
    "in this appendix , we give the mass matrices for the charged leptons and the neutrinos , @xmath220 and @xmath221 , of the five viable configurations presented in table  [ tb : nup ] .",
    "all mass matrices are given in units of gev .",
