    "in recent years there has been considerable interest in generating steady - state currents in a plasma with rf waves . in particular , it was predicted @xcite that these currents could be efficiently generated by waves whose phase velocities are several times the electron thermal speed .",
    "this prediction has been confirmed by numerous experiments in which the current was driven by lower - hybrid waves .",
    "these results allow us to contemplate a steady - state tokamak reactor in which the toroidal current is driven by lower - hybrid waves .",
    "this is an attractive proposition not only because of the advantages inherent in steady - state operation ( less thermal stress , higher duty cycle , etc . ) , but also because it opens up the possibility that the ohmic winding of the tokamak can be eliminated entirely , leading to a cheaper and more compact reactor .",
    "this latter possibility can be realized if rf waves are successful not only in sustaining the plasma current `` steady - state current drive , '' but also in increasing the plasma current `` rf current ramp - up . '' in fact , experiments have demonstrated that this too is possible . from a theoretical point of view , the important additional ingredient in these experiments is the dc electric field which opposes the increase of the plasma current .",
    "the electric field is also present in schemes where the rf is used to recharge the transformer at constant current .",
    "recently , we presented a theory for rf current drive in the presence of an electric field @xcite .",
    "this theory predicted that rf energy could be efficiently converted to poloidal field energy if the wave phase velocity were approximately equal to the electron runaway velocity .",
    "this theory has been compared @xcite with data from the plt experiment @xcite , and excellent agreement is found . in ,",
    "the linearized boltzmann equation was approximately solved by integrating the corresponding langevin equations using a monte - carlo method . in this paper",
    ", we use a more elegant theory to calculate the efficiency of the current ramp - up based on an adjoint formulation for the boltzmann equation @xcite .",
    "although the limits of validity of this theory are the same as for , this theory is more amenable to accurate evaluation on a computer , and it is more easily extended to include effects which are omitted here .",
    "let us begin by reiterating the physical picture given in .",
    "consider an electron travelling in the positive direction at several times the thermal speed and which has just absorbed an incremental amount of rf energy .",
    "suppose there is an electric field tending to decelerate this electron .",
    "the question is : where does this incremental energy end up ?",
    "if the electron is slow compared to the runaway velocity , the electron slows down primarily due to collisions and so the rf energy goes to bulk heating . on the other hand ,",
    "if the electron is fast , the electron is slowed down by the electric field . in this case , the rf energy is coupled to the plasma circuit and appears as poloidal field energy .",
    "unfortunately , fast electrons have a high probability of pitch - angle scattering into the reverse direction and running away .",
    "a runaway electron drains energy out of the electric field , leading to a degradation of the ramp - up efficiency",
    ". however , there is a window around the runaway velocity where the electrons are slowed down principally by the electric field and yet where the probability of running away is very small .",
    "this is the favorable regime in which rf energy can be efficiently converted to poloidal field energy .    from the foregoing discussion",
    ", we see that two ingredients are needed for an accurate theoretical treatment of this problem .",
    "first , the electric field must be treated as large . in the efficient regime",
    ", the force on the electron due to the electric field must be comparable to that due to collisions .",
    "second , a two - dimensional treatment is required .",
    "analyses based on a one - dimensional fokker ",
    "planck equation do not predict the important physical phenomenon of rf - generated reverse runaways .",
    "we briefly review the history of theoretical studies of current drive in the presence of an electric field .",
    "the earliest theoretical studies @xcite of lower - hybrid current drive assumed that there was no electric field in the plasma .",
    "this is the appropriate limit for a steady - state reactor .",
    "however , some of the early experiments conducted to verify the predictions of the theory were conducted in regimes where the ohmic electric field was still present .",
    "this prompted a series of papers @xcite dealing with rf current drive in the presence of an assisting electric field ( i.e. , the electric field and the rf both accelerate the electrons in the same direction ) .",
    "the principal focus of these papers was the calculation of an enhanced runaway rate when the phase velocity of the waves is in the neighborhood of the runaway velocity .",
    "an opposing electric field was treated by borrass and nocentini @xcite within the framework of a one - dimensional fokker ",
    "planck analysis .",
    "a similar model has been employed more recently by liu _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "as noted above , such an analysis can not include rf - generated reverse runaways . also due to the crudity of the one - dimensional equation , the results are only accurate to within a factor of order unity even when no runaways are generated .",
    "a two - dimensional treatment of the problem in the small electric field limit has been given by start @xcite for the case of current drive by electron - cyclotron waves .",
    "this work neglected electron - electron collisions .",
    "this defect was removed and the results generalized to arbitrary current - drive methods by fisch @xcite employing an adjoint formulation .",
    "this work yields accurate results when the electric field is small .",
    "however , the results are inapplicable in the regime of efficient ramp - up where the phase velocity is comparable to the runaway velocity .",
    "our earlier paper @xcite was the first to combine a two - dimensional treatment with a large electric field .",
    "this paper allowed an accurate calculation of the ramp - up efficiency in cases of practical interest , and identified the regime in which high efficiencies can be expected .",
    "the present work is a continuation and expansion of that earlier paper . besides using the more sophisticated method @xcite for solving the boltzmann equation",
    ", we endeavor to give the results in a form that allows both easy comparison with experiments and easy implementation within the framework of ray - tracing or transport codes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we begin with the linearized boltzmann equation for the perturbed electron distribution in the presence of an electric field and an rf source ( sec .  [ basic ] ) .",
    "some approximations and normalizations are made to reduce this equation to a more manageable form .",
    "the use of the adjoint method @xcite for solving the resulting equation is described ( sec .",
    "[ formulation ] ) .",
    "next ( sec .",
    "[ results ] ) the adjoint equation is solved numerically to give the runaway probability and the green s function for the current .",
    "the latter quantity is reduced to a simple form which involves just two functions of velocity .",
    "an expression for the total current density is given ( sec .",
    "[ circuit ] ) and this is put into a form which is easy to calculate . how the rf - driven current interacts with the electric field to produce poloidal field energy is considered ( sec .",
    "[ applications ] ) , and the results are applied to experiments .",
    "consider a uniform electron - ion plasma , initially at equilibrium . for @xmath0 ,",
    "it is subject to an electric field @xmath1 and a wave - induced flux @xmath2 .",
    "we will take the ions to be infinitely massive , so that they form a stationary background off which the electrons collide .",
    "if the electric field and the wave - induced flux are weak enough , the electron distribution remains close to a maxwellian for @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the energy of an electron @xmath5 .",
    "substituting @xmath6 into the boltzmann equation for the electron distribution @xmath7 and linearizing then gives @xmath8f_m , \\eqlab{lin}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the linearized collision operator .",
    "here @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are the electron charge , mass , number density , and temperature .",
    "note that @xmath11 carries the sign of the electron charge ( i.e. , @xmath15 ) .",
    "this equation is to be solved with initial condition @xmath16 .",
    "we demand that the subsequent evolution of @xmath17 be such that it be orthogonal to @xmath18 and @xmath19 , i.e. , that it have zero density and energy .",
    "the zero - density condition is satisfied with @xmath20 since all the terms in are particle conserving .",
    "the zero - energy condition gives an equation for the time evolution of @xmath14 @xmath21 the two terms on the right - hand side represent the heating due to the waves and due to @xmath22 .",
    "we now make three simplifying assumptions : we assume that @xmath17 is azimuthally symmetric about the ambient magnetic field ; we take the electric field to be constant and in the direction parallel to the magnetic field @xmath23 ; and we restrict our attention to those cases where @xmath24 is only finite where @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the thermal velocity .",
    "we may then solve using the high - velocity form for @xmath27 : @xmath28,\\ ] ] where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the dielectric constant of free space , @xmath32 is the coulomb logarithm , and @xmath33 is the effective ion charge state .",
    "we have included pitch - angle scattering and frictional slowing down , but ignored energy diffusion . in the problem of steady - state current drive @xcite , the energy diffusion term introduces corrections of order @xmath34 .",
    "another term neglected in this approximate collision operator is the effect of the maxwellian colliding off the perturbed distribution , @xmath35 .",
    "the corrections due to this term @xcite are of order @xmath36 . with these approximations ,",
    "the collision operator does not depend on the electron temperature @xmath14 .",
    "formally , we may derive the form for @xmath27 by taking @xmath37 . in this limit",
    ", we have @xmath38 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce some normalizations .",
    "the runaway velocity @xmath39 is that velocity at which collisional frictional force equals the acceleration due to the electric field @xmath40 notice that the sign of @xmath39 is opposite to the direction in which electrons run away .",
    "the dreicer velocity @xcite is given by @xmath41 .",
    "similarly , we define a runaway collision frequency @xmath42 the normalized time and velocity are given by @xmath43 and @xmath44 the components of @xmath45 have to be normalized with care : @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "this implies that @xmath49 so that the conversion of the pitch - angle variable @xmath50 in @xmath45 space to that in @xmath51 space involves multiplication by @xmath52 .",
    "other quantities are normalized in a similar way ; however , we shall use the same symbols as for the unnormalized quantities .",
    "thus , the distribution functions @xmath17 and @xmath53 are normalized to @xmath54 , the rf - induced flux @xmath24 to @xmath55 , etc . under this normalization",
    ", then becomes @xmath56 with @xmath57 and with the operator @xmath58 defined by @xmath59 equation ( [ linb ] ) is singular at the origin .",
    "however , because @xmath17 in describes a physical particle distribution , it obeys a particle conservation law near the origin .",
    "we therefore require that , close to @xmath60 , @xmath61 with @xmath62 and @xmath63 equation ( [ linb ] ) depends only on a single parameter @xmath33 .",
    "the dependence on the electric field @xmath64 can be normalized away , since the electric field defines the only natural velocity scale in the problem , @xmath39 .",
    "is amenable to various methods of solution , and it is instructive to review these before describing the method used here . the most straightforward approach is to integrate directly on a computer .",
    "this method allows @xmath24 to be determined directly in terms of the electron distribution @xmath7 .",
    "however , a thorough understanding of the problem requires that many different forms of @xmath24 be used .",
    "therefore , this procedure is costly because the several parameters used to specify @xmath24 must be scanned .",
    "this is essentially the method adopted in the early numerical studies of steady - state current drive by lower - hybrid waves @xcite .",
    "the situation is improved to some extent by noting that is a linear equation for @xmath17 .",
    "it may be solved in terms of a green s function @xmath65 given by the equation @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",
    "the electron distribution is then given by the convolution @xmath68 this approach reduces the problem to the determination of a single function @xmath65 of two vector arguments ( @xmath51 and @xmath69 ) and a one scalar argument ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "however this is still a daunting computational task .",
    "a closely related technique is to formulate the problem as a set of langevin equations @xcite , @xmath71 where the pitch - angle scattering is represented by the stochastic term @xmath72 . assuming that @xmath73 and @xmath74 are given ( i.e. , non - stochastic )",
    ", then @xmath72 satisfies @xmath75 where the angle brackets denote averaging over the ensemble defined by all the realizations of @xmath76 .",
    "consider following a particular electron using eqs .",
    "( [ monte ] ) .",
    "suppose that the electron is observed to travel with velocity @xmath69 at @xmath77 .",
    "then @xmath78 is the probability that the velocity of the electron at time @xmath70 is in the volume element @xmath79 located at @xmath80 . in appendix  [ fokker ] , it is shown that this conditional probability @xmath65 satisfies .",
    "thus the solution to can be found by determining the distribution of a large number of electrons obeying eqs .",
    "( [ monte ] ) with initial conditions with @xmath81 .",
    "consequently , moments of @xmath65 can be determined by ensemble averages of the langevin variables .",
    "for example , the current given by may be found by @xmath82    equations  ( [ monte ] ) may be integrated numerically by noting that @xmath83 should be picked from an ensemble with mean @xmath84 and variance @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath50 are the values of those variables at time @xmath70 .",
    "as long as @xmath87 is sufficiently small , further details about the distribution of @xmath76 are unimportant",
    ".    now eqs .",
    "( [ monte ] ) are the equations solved in our earlier paper @xcite .",
    "this shows the exact equivalence between the approach adopted there and that employed in the present work .",
    "because the langevin equations describe the electron behavior in a slightly more physical manner , they often help in the interpretation of the solutions to the boltzmann equation .",
    "this is especially true when some electrons run away .",
    "the langevin equations are also very easy to solve numerically by a monte - carlo method ( as was done in ) , although their solution tends to be much more costly than just solving directly .    equations ( [ monte ] ) however may be easily solved analytically in the limit @xmath88 ( this is equivalent to taking the limit @xmath89 ) .",
    "taking an ensemble average of the equations , we obtain @xmath90 note that @xmath86 is not a stochastic variable in this limit .",
    "consequently , the hierarchy of moment equations may be closed at this point .",
    "these are the slowing - down equations solved by fisch and boozer @xcite to give the current moment of electron distribution @xmath91 .",
    "this shows that the approach used in that paper is equivalent to solving the boltzmann equation .",
    "the methods for solving the boltzmann equation described in the previous section all entail a large amount of computation .",
    "( an exception is the limit @xmath92 , when the ensemble - averaged langevin equations can be solved analytically @xcite . )",
    "the problem with these methods is that they are all capable of giving the electron distribution function @xmath17 .",
    "since , in many cases , we are only interested in specific moments of @xmath17 , we may hope to reduce the computational requirements substantially by using a method that gives only those specific moments .",
    "suppose we wish to determine a particular moment of @xmath17 , namely @xmath93 ( for instance , the current density would be given by @xmath94 . )",
    "let us define the corresponding moment of the green s function @xmath95 the moment @xmath96 is then given in terms of @xmath97 by @xmath98    what is needed is some method of calculating @xmath97 which does nt involve having to find @xmath65 .",
    "this is provided by the adjoint formulation of fisch @xcite .",
    "he shows that @xmath99 satisfies @xmath100 with @xmath101 and with the operator @xmath102 defined by @xmath103 the singularity at the origin is handled by the boundary condition @xmath104 . the operators @xmath58 and @xmath102 are adjoint operators , so that @xmath105 for all @xmath106 and @xmath107 satisifying @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "similar techniques were introduced earlier by antonsen and chu @xcite and by taguchi @xcite for the study of steady - state current drive .",
    "the significant improvements afforded by are the ability to determine arbitrary moments of @xmath17 and the inclusion of the time - dependence of @xmath17 . both of these are important in the problem of current ramp - up .    from the relation between the two green s functions @xmath97 and @xmath65",
    ", we see that @xmath97 has a simple interpretation .",
    "equations  ( [ green ] ) and ( [ monte ] ) describe the evolution of a group of electrons released at @xmath77 at velocity @xmath69 .",
    "let us suppose that we are interested in the current density so that @xmath110",
    ". then @xmath111 gives the mean current carried by those electrons a time @xmath70 later .",
    "how works is easily seen by taking @xmath112 so that the electron only experiences the electric field . in the boltzmann equation ,",
    "the electrons have slowed down to @xmath113 at time @xmath70 .",
    "correspondingly in the adjoint equation , the initial condition @xmath114 is transported in the reverse direction so that @xmath115 .",
    "thus at time @xmath70 , we are provided with information about the electrons in their current location .    solving the boltzmann equation by means of the adjoint formulation results in a great simplification of the problem . the adjoint equation ( [ adjointb ] ) is an equation of equal complexity to the original boltzmann equation ( [ linb ] ) .",
    "however , by solving for a particular initial condition , we can find the corresponding moment of @xmath17 using for _ any _ driving term @xmath24 .",
    "the proof that @xmath97 is given by is most easily carried out by assuming that holds and then by proving that @xmath97 is related to the general green s function @xmath65 by .",
    "consider the equation for @xmath116 , @xmath117 we multiply this equation by @xmath118 , integrate over all velocity space , and use the adjoint relation between @xmath58 and @xmath102 to give @xmath119 substituting from and integrating in @xmath120 from @xmath121 to @xmath70 , gives @xmath122 if we evaluate this expression using the initial conditions for @xmath65 and @xmath97 , we obtain .",
    "up until now , we have assumed that all the equations are solved in an infinite velocity domain .",
    "this is not a convenient formulation for numerical implementation where , necessarily , we wish to solve equations in a finite domain .",
    "here we shall only solve in a spherical domain @xmath123 such that @xmath124 .",
    "we will choose @xmath125 to be sufficiently large that the interesting physics where the electric field competes with the collisions happens inside @xmath123 .",
    "outside @xmath123 collisions may be ignored and the electrons are merely freely accelerated by the electric field .",
    "we must impose boundary conditions on @xmath126 , the boundary of @xmath123 .",
    "again we follow the treatment given in ref .  .",
    "we begin by noting that both and are hyperbolic in the @xmath86 direction .",
    "the boundary therefore divides into two pieces depending on whether the characteristics enter or leave the domain .",
    "we define @xmath127 ( resp .",
    "@xmath128 ) as that portion of @xmath126 on which @xmath129 ( resp .  @xmath130 ) .",
    "the characteristics of enter @xmath123 on @xmath127 and leave on @xmath128 , while those of enter @xmath123 on @xmath128 and leave on @xmath127 .",
    "boundary conditions must be specified where the characteristics enter the domain @xmath123 . for @xmath125",
    "sufficiently large , the solution beyond @xmath126 may be determined by ignoring collisions .",
    "thus @xmath131 for @xmath51 on @xmath127 and @xmath132 for @xmath51 on @xmath128 .",
    "( if energy scattering had been included in the collision operator , the equations would revert to parabolic , and boundary conditions would have to be specified over the whole of @xmath126 .",
    "however , there would be a boundary layer where the characteristics of the approximate equations are outgoing , and the boundary conditions here would only weakly affect the solution in the interior of @xmath123 . )",
    "although was derived under the simplifying assumptions that the electric field was constant and the high - velocity form of collision operator is valid , the adjoint method as described in applies equally well without such restrictive assumptions .",
    "thus , the equation adjoint to reads @xcite @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the operator adjoint to @xmath27 .",

    "this equation will enable us to incorporate the effects of a slowly varying electric field into our analysis .",
    "it also makes explicit the additive nature of those effects due to the electric field alone ( i.e. , with @xmath142 ) and those effects due to the rf combined with the electric field ( i.e. , with @xmath143 ) . of course , the effects due to the electric field alone are well studied and give rise to phenomena such as the spitzer ",
    "hrm conductivity @xcite and runaways @xcite .",
    "moments of the electron distribution @xmath17 can now be calculated by solving with the corresponding initial and boundary conditions . in practice",
    ", this procedure still offers us too much information . both for a deeper understanding of the underlying physics and for easy implementation in numerical codes , the trick is to discover the few important functions by which the major effects can be described . in this section ,",
    "we determine those functions needed for an accurate treatment of rf current ramp - up .",
    "let us suppose that rf flux is present only for some finite time .",
    "electrons obeying then eventually suffer one of two fates .",
    "either they run away under the influence of the electric field @xmath144 , or else they collapse into the electron bulk @xmath145 .",

    "the overall picture of the flow of power in an experiment is as follows : rf power @xmath278 is injected into the machine . of this a fraction @xmath281 is absorbed by the resonant electrons ; the rest may be absorbed by the ions or by the vacuum vessel .",
    "a fraction @xmath282 of this power is then converted into electromagnetic energy .",
    "@xmath283 acts as another source of poloidal field energy , while the ohmic dissipation @xmath284 acts as a drain . from this discussion",
    ", we see that @xmath282 describes the `` ideal '' efficiency of rf current ramp - up .",
    "the practical efficiency is expressible in terms of this efficiency , @xmath281 , and @xmath284 .",
    "the determination of @xmath282 from is complicated by the presence of runaways .",
    "runaways are deleterious to the ramp - up efficiency since their current is in the same direction as @xmath64 and so they subtract from @xmath285 . for efficient current ramp - up",
    "we must either avoid creating runaways by making sure @xmath24 is localized in that region of velocity space where the runaway probability @xmath157 is small ( see figs .  [ run - fig ] and [ run - figa ] ) , or else take steps to lose the runaways .",
    "we can approximately treat these cases by taking @xmath286 in to give @xmath287 since this involves the ratio of two integrals over @xmath51 , the result is insensitive to the detailed form of @xmath24 . in cases of practical interest",
    ", we may assume that @xmath24 is localized in @xmath51 .",
    "then , we have @xmath288 where @xmath289 is the normalized velocity of the resonant electrons .    for lower - hybrid waves we have @xmath290 and",
    "the waves interact with particles through the landau resonance @xmath291 , where @xmath292 and @xmath293 are the wave frequency and parallel wave number .",
    "furthermore , the typical perpendicular velocity of the resonant electrons equals the electron thermal velocity , so that @xmath294 . thus is to be evaluated with @xmath295 and @xmath169 .",

    "we evaluate at @xmath301 and @xmath169 to give @xmath302 which is plotted in ( b ) .    using eqs .",
    "( [ effa ] ) , it is possible to identify regions of high conversion efficiency of wave energy to electric energy , given the restriction of @xmath157 small . additionally , if the ohmic losses , @xmath284 , are small , then by , we see that the conversion of wave energy to poloidal field energy can be of high efficiency .",
    "this , in fact , is what has been achieved on the plt experiment , where conversion efficiencies of over @xmath303 have been reported @xcite .",
    "an important practical consequence of the circuit equations derived here is that fast ramp - up rates , i.e. , large @xmath304 , are possible at high density .",
    "in fact , these fast ramp - up rates are _ necessary _ for high energy conversion efficiencies at high density .",
    "this can be seen as follows : the efficiency , @xmath282 , is a function of the dimensionless parameter @xmath216 , depending , in addition , only weakly on @xmath33 .",
    "for a given machine and a given wave phase velocity , the parameter @xmath216 depends only on the ratio , @xmath305 ; and the ramp - up rate , @xmath304 , depends only on the dc electric field , @xmath64 .",
    "thus , the efficiency depends only on the ratio of @xmath304 to @xmath13 .",
    "it has been observed experimentally on the plt experiment that high efficiency of converting rf energy to magnetic field energy is possible at a low plasma density .",
    "thus , we can predict that a similar high efficiency is possible in the event that the density and the ramp - up rate are scaled up together .",
    "in fact , for large ramp - up rates , high density can actually be desirable in that it impedes the production of runaways .",
    "note that this window of desired density for a given ramp - up rate is counter to our intuition derived from steady - state considerations , where the larger the density the less the current - drive efficiency .",
    "there are several optimizations that one might wish to achieve in the ramp - up problem .",
    "one is to maximize the energy conversion efficiency , @xmath282 .",
    "a second is to minimize the ramp - up time , @xmath306 .",
    "the minimization of capital costs for the rf system , however , may demand that we minimize @xmath278 , the rf power required to ramp - up a given current .",
    "we can express this more precisely with some convenient formulas . in the absence of the external source @xmath270",
    ", the ramp - up rate may be written using faraday s law as @xmath307 where a tokamak inductance @xmath308 was assumed , and where @xmath64 is the dc electric field in units of @xmath309 .",
    "note that the ramp - up rate depends linearly on @xmath64 and is almost independent of geometry ( @xmath310 ) .",
    "the amount of dissipated rf power required can than be written as @xmath311 if we neglect both ohmic losses ( @xmath284 ) and the external source @xmath283 .",
    "thus , in extrapolating results to larger tokamaks ( higher @xmath312 ) , we can maintain linear ( in the required stored energy ) power requirements , with the same ramp - up time and the same efficiencies , if the density scales linearly with @xmath313 and hence with @xmath272 . here",
    ", the wave phase velocities also remain the same , and in the event of the same temperatures , the physics of the damping may be expected to be very similar , so that the percentage of incident rf power that is absorbed , @xmath281 , remains constant too .",
    "for example , using ( a ) , we see that in plt with @xmath314 , @xmath315 , @xmath316 , we find reported ramp - up rates of @xmath317 , or @xmath318 . here",
    "@xmath319 and ideal efficiencies of about @xmath320 at @xmath167 may be expected with little runaway production , consistent with experimental data .",
    "also , consistent with the data would be somewhat higher @xmath33 , but then only if the confinement of runaways were not perfect .    for reactor - grade tokamaks ,",
    "say @xmath321 and @xmath322 , a ramp - up time which is longer than that in plt is desirable in order to minimize @xmath278 and the capital cost of the rf system . for a @xmath323 ramp - up time , a density of @xmath324 renders the ratio @xmath325 as in the plt experiment .",
    "employing a similar spectrum of waves ( @xmath326 ) in a plasma of temperature also similar to the plt experiment ( @xmath327 ) implies a similar @xmath281 ( about 0.7 ) .",
    "thus , using , we see that @xmath328 would be required .    to summarize the tradeoffs here",
    ", we note that while @xmath329 is minimized by considering only the ratio @xmath325 , the minimization of @xmath278 requires the @xmath330 be large .",
    "thus , although very quick ramp - up rates are indeed achievable at high density , the capital costs for such a system are proportionately larger too . balancing the desires for a quick ramp - up against those for low capital costs ( low @xmath278 )",
    "points to a parameter range of moderate density .",
    "efficient ramp - up is only achieved when , in addition to the above restrictions , the temperature is moderate , since at high temperatures , @xmath284 losses , neglected in , begin to dominate .",
    "the regime where these ohmic losses dominate may be identified by writing @xmath331 these losses represent only small corrections when @xmath332 , or , using , when @xmath333 for the reactor - grade example , @xmath334 , @xmath335 , the above inequality requires that the ramp - up time be longer than about @xmath336 of the @xmath337 time .",
    "this restricts the temperature to somewhat less than @xmath338 .",
    "restricting the temperature during a period of intense rf injection ( perhaps @xmath339 ) requires a small heat confinement time during the start - up operation . in the above example",
    ", this may be as small as @xmath340 .",
    "poor confinement during the start - up phase may be helpful from the standpoint of runaway buildup too .",
    "even a small percentage @xmath341 of reverse runaways @xcite can seriously impede ramp - up if the runaways are well confined .",
    "if the runaways are poorly confined , then higher percentages may be tolerated , allowing higher ramp - up rates and , consequently , higher energy conversion efficiencies for a given density .",
    "we are led thus to the following typical picture of rf ramp - up for pulsed tokamak operation .",
    "start - up can proceed in a low density plasma @xcite where the rf power is also used to initiate the plasma . density and rf power , and the ramp - up rate ,",
    "are increased concomitantly as the plasma is brought to interesting densities @xmath342@xmath343 . during this phase ,",
    "the temperature is purposefully kept low , possibly through a deliberate degradation of the confinement of both runaway and thermal electrons .",
    "hence the current is programmed to reach a large value prior to the density , and both reach large values prior to the temperature .",
    "the final step , in which the reactor is brought to reactor - grade temperature , occurs after the current is ramped up and as a result of ceasing the deliberate degradation of confinement .",
    "in this paper we have written down a set of circuit equations that describe the dynamics of an rf - driven plasma . in arriving at these circuit equations",
    ", we systematically introduced approximations with a goal of characterizing the driven plasma by a small number of functions of few variables that retain the essential physics .",
    "greater accuracy , possible at the price of more complex circuit equations , may be obtained as a natural extension of the development here . the identification and calculation here of a minimal set of transport functions , however , provided a suitable and manageable description for a large class of important problems .",
    "the calculations of the runaway function @xmath157 and of the energy conversion function @xmath344 together pinpoint the preferred region for tokamak ramp - up operation .",
    "these functions depend only on the dimensionless parameter @xmath51 .",
    "the separate contributions of runaway and stopped currents may be described using these functions of a single variable .",
    "the constitutive relations thus obtained are given by eqs .",
    "( [ jrf - a ] ) .",
    "these equations are in a form both suitable for implementation in a transport code and amenable to obvious modification in the event that more complex runaway models are desired .",
    "there are several caveats to bear in mind in using these formulas .",
    "first , the time scale for variation of the dc electric fields has been assumed long compared to other scales of interest , such as the particle deceleration times .",
    "a violation of this scale separation would affect the normalizations through @xmath39 .",
    "second , knowledge of the rf spectrum is unlikely to be complete .",
    "this knowledge is necessary to give @xmath345 , the rf - induced flux . even if the incident rf energy is followed by ray - tracing codes , it remains possible that other waves may be present .",
    "these other waves might arise either due to asymmetries in the particle distribution functions or due to nonlinear effects associated with the incident spectrum .",
    "third , particle transport across field lines was neglected in comparison to the effects along field lines .",
    "the neglect of these effects is possible for stopped electrons if they are stopped before they reach a flux surface with significantly different conditions ( @xmath39 different ) . for runaway electrons ,",
    "these effects are always important in that they provide a model for the runaway loss . as discussed after eqs .",
    "( [ jrf - a ] ) , such model may be included through a natural modification of eq .",
    "( [ jrf - a]c ) . in the absence of one particularly compelling model , at present ,",
    "for runaway loss we have left the modification of eq .",
    "( [ jrf - a]c ) as an open issue .",
    "finally , we should note that some of the most powerful conclusions of this paper occur in certain special cases .",
    "it is often the case that the rf spectrum is not only known , but also localized , which enables a particularly simple evaluation of the conversion efficiency , as in eqs .",
    "( [ effa ] ) . in the event of moderate electric fields , or spectra localized at moderate phase velocities",
    ", it may be that @xmath286 ( no runaway production ) , and an accurate runaway loss model would not be needed . in the event that runaways are confined well",
