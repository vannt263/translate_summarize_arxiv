    "after approximately 10 years of operation , an upgrade of the lhc to a tenfold luminosity of 10@xmath5  @xmath3s@xmath6 ( super - lhc or slhc ) is under discussion .",
    "this will lead to very high radiation levels , especially in the innermost tracking region where a 1  mev neutron equivalent fluence of @xmath7 is expected @xcite .",
    "thus silicon detectors as used today will suffer from severe damage caused by radiation - induced defects .",
    "a strong degradation of the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) will occur due to an increasing depletion voltage ( @xmath8 ) at high fluences , higher leakage currents ( @xmath9 ) and trapping of charge carriers .",
    "trapping reduces the charge collection efficiency ( cce ) significantly and is considered to be the most limiting factor at slhc fluences .",
    "the degradation of cce at moderate voltages ( e.g. around 150  v ) with increasing fluence is clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ cce - intro ] . however , recently we reported on cce values larger than 1 in highly proton - irradiated thin epitaxial ( epi ) diodes at high voltages ( see fig .",
    "[ cce - intro ] ) , which indicates that trapping is overcompensated by charge multiplication ( cm ) @xcite",
    ". apparently , the electric fields in thin , highly - irradiated sensors operated at high voltages are sufficiently high for impact ionisation .",
    "evidence of cm has been also found in cce measurements of highly - irradiated planar @xcite and 3d @xcite strip detectors .",
    "obviously , it would be desirable to use cm effects to overcome trapping in highly - damaged position - sensitive detectors at the slhc .",
    "therefore , a detailed understanding of the formation and the properties of such a radiation - induced cm region is of significant interest .",
    "consequently , the following issues related to cm are studied in this work : the location of the cm region with respect to the detector depth , the dependence of cm on thickness , material , annealing and temperature , the proportionality between measured and deposited charge , the spatial uniformity of cm over the detector area , the long - term stability of detector operation in the cm regime and effects of cm on the charge spectrum and noise .",

    "could be applied either by a chiller with a temperature precision of around 0.3@xmath23c or by a chiller in combination with a peltier element , which improved the precision to better than 0.1@xmath23c .",
    "if not stated otherwise , the measurements were done at -10@xmath23c in a nitrogen atmosphere in order to reduce the high leakage current and operate the diode under lhc conditions .",
    "furthermore , if not stated otherwise , 512 current pulses were averaged .",
    "due to high capacitances and small charge collection times in the order of 1  ns in thin diodes the time structure of the signal was not well - resolved except for small 150  @xmath1 m thick sensors so that only the collected charge will be dealt with in the following .    a problem during the measurements at high voltages of both irradiated and unirradiated diodes were micro discharges , i.e. randomly occurring current peaks probably due to sudden discharges in high - field regions at the edge of the diode or implants .",
    "the occurrence and frequency were not reproducible .",

    "the cce of 670  nm laser light and @xmath4-particles with 24  @xmath1 m absorber is highest , followed by @xmath4-particles with 12  @xmath1 m absorber and without absorber and by 830  nm laser light .",
    "the lowest cce , but still exceeding 1 , was measured for 1060  nm laser light .",
    "to conclude , the cm depends on the position where the e - h pairs have been initially deposited : the closer the charge carriers have been produced to the front surface the stronger the cm .",
    "the following simplified considerations on the formation of the radiation - induced cm region show that this is what one would expect because the high - field region in non - type - inverted p@xmath0n diodes is located at the front surface . for a first rough estimation a linear field dependence with a depletion voltage of 750  v due to uniform radiation - induced space charge",
    "is assumed .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath8 could not be directly measured for this sample due to high leakage currents , but needed to be extrapolated from measurements of the donor introduction rate in lower irradiated diodes after 8  min annealing at 80@xmath11c @xcite .",
    "also the assumption of a linear electric field dependence is only a rough approximation in highly - irradiated diodes as the high level of reverse current modifies the electric field distribution by changing the space charge and leading to a voltage drop over the neutral bulk region , which becomes highly - resistive after irradiation @xcite .",
    "e.g. double peak electric field structures have been observed in 150  @xmath1 m thick epi diodes irradiated with fluences around @xmath43  @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "[ cm_simulation]a shows the assumed field at 900  v compared to the one of an unirradiated diode with @xmath44  v. the maximum of @xmath29 at the front side is higher for 75 - 1e16 than for the unirradiated case .",
    "as the ionisation coefficient @xmath45 is a strong function of the electric field , such a difference in @xmath29 leads to considerable values of @xmath46 for electrons in 75 - 1e16 in a 30  @xmath1 m thick layer ( fig .",
    "[ cm_simulation]b ) .",

    "it can be seen that considerable values of @xmath51 are present in a thin , approximately 10  @xmath1 m thick layer at the front side . if @xmath49 is convoluted with the respective distributions of deposited charge from fig .",

    "this can be explained by the components of the @xmath4-beam with effectively shallower penetration due to its divergence or low - energy component ( cf .",
    "section  [ sec : methods ] ) because they undergo stronger multiplication .",

    "[ different_material]b ) .",
    "this can be explained by a higher donor introduction rate for do material compared to st material as observed in n - type epi diodes @xcite , which leads to higher space charge densities and therefore higher maximum field values at the p - n junction .",
    "probably also the different distributions of oxygen concentration affect the space charge and consequently the field distribution .",
    "the cce of thinner diodes is found to be higher than the cce of thicker samples for the same si material ( see figs .  [ different_material]a , c ) .",

    "below full depletion the electric field distribution @xmath58 in the linear model does not depend on the thickness , but only on the space charge density and none of the extrapolated depletion voltages of the diodes studied here is below 600  v. but modifications to the linear field like double peak and voltage drop over the neutral bulk region are expected to lead to non - zero field values over the entire diode thickness far below the nominal depletion voltage .",
    "moreover , in the case of 75  @xmath1 m another reason for higher maximum fields could be the higher donor introduction rate @xmath59 than in thicker materials , which is probably due to the larger average oxygen concentration .",

    "as 512 externally triggered pulses have been averaged , this becomes manifest only as moderate , but clearly visible fluctuations of the cce curve .",
    "however , in the case of self - triggering or high - frequency readout like at the ( s)lhc it would be impossible to detect the signal of an impinging particle reliably and it poses potential dangers for the readout electronics .",
    "for operation at such high voltages , micro discharges would have to be avoided .",
    "so far only the signal averaged over 512 pulses was discussed . however , in a real experiment a detector signal needs to be separated from noise event - by - event .",
    "therefore , 301 single tct pulses were taken and their baseline noise and charge spectrum investigated with special emphasis on the cm regime .",
    "a ) b )    a ) b )    the shot noise @xmath63 related to fluctuations in the bulk leakage current is expected to increase in the cm regime because also the bulk leakage current is multiplied ( with a factor @xmath64 which can be different from @xmath51 for the signal ) .",
    "already a constant multiplication would increase the shot noise by @xmath64 , which might be further enhanced by fluctuations due to the statistical nature of cm , which are described by the excess noise factor  @xmath65 @xcite :    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the shot noise without cm . according to @xcite @xmath65 is increasing with @xmath68 and @xmath60 . for @xmath69 , which is valid for low fields just above the cm threshold",
    ", @xmath65 goes asymptotically to 2 for large @xmath68 .",
    "however , @xmath60 is a strong function of @xmath29 so that also @xmath65 is increasing with increasing field .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio is given by    @xmath70    where @xmath71 is the mean collected charge , @xmath72 the mean collected charge without cm and @xmath73 noise contributions that are not affected by cm .",
    "thus , it depends on the relation of the parameter values whether cm can improve the snr . for @xmath74",
    "the snr improves as long as @xmath75 .",
    "if @xmath76 the snr can only improve if @xmath77 .    with a tct setup",
    "the transient current pulse is recorded directly .",
    "thus , the enc was determined in a similar way as the charge signal by integrating over the tct baseline before the pulse in a time window of @xmath1210  ns .",
    "[ noise]a shows the rms noise as a function of bias voltage for measurements with 670 and 1060  nm laser light .",
    "the difference is probably due to random fluctuations .",
    "the noise of an unirradiated diode , which should be mostly dominated by other noise contributions @xmath73 than shot noise since leakage current is low , was found to be within 20 - 26  ke .",
    "this shows that the noise of a tct setup is significantly higher than in the case of a charge - sensitive readout with optimised shaper . up to 650",
    "v the noise of 75 - 1e16 is similar to the one of the unirradiated diode before increasing to @xmath1245  ke at 900  v. this behaviour can be explained by the high value of @xmath73 of the tct setup , which is exceeded by an increasing shot noise only above 650  v.    from this , the snr was calculated , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ noise]b as a function of the mean collected charge @xmath71 .",
    "as for both 670 and 1060  nm laser light similar values of @xmath78  e - h pairs were deposited , the snr for the unirradiated diodes are also similar ( 70 - 85 ) .",
    "even for 75 - 1e16 similar snr values were found at the same collected charge of @xmath35 because at the voltages needed for cce values of 1 ( 480  v for 670  nm and 650  v for 1060  nm ) the noise has not increased . for higher voltages respectively mean collected charge the snr is still improving , but slower than before because also the noise is increasing .",
    "for the same collected charge , the snr of 670  nm is seen to be higher than the snr of 1060  nm because in the case of 670  nm lower voltages are needed for the same cce ( cf .",
    "[ cce_different_pen ] ) , which implies lower noise .",
    "but it should be emphasised that also in the case of 1060  nm laser light , which has similar penetration as mips , in highly - irradiated sensors at high voltages higher snr values are obtained than before irradiation due to cm .",
    "however , for the tct setup with laser both the noise and the signal were much higher than in a realistic slhc detector so that further studies with mips and a low - noise charge readout will be carried out",
    ".      cm does not only affect the electronic noise of the baseline , but also the charge spectrum of the signal .",
    "the width of the spectrum is expected to increase due to multiplication and associated statistical fluctuations in a similar way as the shot noise ( but note the different @xmath51 and @xmath79 ) : @xmath80 .",
    "furthermore , when performing a measurement the charge spectrum is convoluted with the baseline noise so that the measured width is given by @xmath81 .",
    "[ spectra]a shows the charge spectra measured with 670  nm laser light for an unirradiated diode at 300  v and for 75 - 1e16 at different voltages .",
    "the charge spectrum width ( standard deviation ) for the unirradiated diode is 48  ke .",
    "the broadening due to cm is easily visible when comparing the spectra of 75 - 1e16 at low and high voltages . to investigate whether the broadening is enhanced by fluctuations ,",
    "the relative width @xmath82 was calculated ( after correcting for baseline noise ) because both @xmath83 and @xmath71 are proportional to @xmath51 so that @xmath51 cancels . the relative width is shown in fig .  [ spectra]b as a function of mean collected charge for 670 and 1060  nm laser light and @xmath4-particles . for laser light it can be seen that at @xmath78  e ( cce=1 ) the relative width of 75 - 1e16 is not much higher than before irradiation ( 670  nm ) or even slightly lower ( 1060  nm ) . the differences might be due to measurement uncertainties . moreover , the relative width of 75 - 1e16 stays constant even for higher @xmath71 ( i.e. higher voltages and multiplication ) , which shows that in the range considered here cm fluctuations are not dominant , probably due to low values of @xmath51 and @xmath60 at not too high fields .",
    "in contrast , the relative width of the spectrum measured with @xmath4-particles significantly increases in the cm regime .",
    "statistical fluctuations in the cm process were ruled out by the measurements with laser light .",
    "thus , the large broadening is probably caused by fluctuations in the amount of charge deposited in the thin cm region .",
    "these might be caused by the divergence of the beam which leads to varying penetration of the @xmath4-particles ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : methods ] ) .",
    "e.g. the bragg peak depth is reduced from 26  @xmath1 m at perpendicular incidence to 18  @xmath1 m at 45@xmath23 , which makes a significant difference as the cm region is assumed to be in a similar thickness range and becomes increasingly stronger for decreasing depth .",
    "it needs to be studied further how the charge spectrum in the cm regime looks for mips as in this case landau fluctuations might lead to a varying deposition in the cm region as well , especially as the layer is so thin .",
    "moreover , the charge deposited by mips is much lower ( most probable value@xmath1280  e/@xmath1 m ) so that much smaller variations of noise and charge spectrum width than measurable here might play a role .",
    "charge multiplication ( cm ) in thin epitaxial n - type pad diodes irradiated by protons up to @xmath2  @xmath3 equivalent fluence was investigated by cce measurements with different tct setups . using radiation of different penetration like 670 , 830 and 1060  nm laser light and @xmath4-particles with and without absorbers",
    ", the cm region could be localised near the p@xmath0-implant .",
    "cm was observed to be higher for thinner sensors and for do material compared to st material and the annealing curve at 80@xmath23c showed the same behaviour as the one for @xmath8 .",
    "all this confirms the assumption of cm as a combined effect of thin sensors and large radiation - induced space charge densities , leading to high electric fields . for a deeper understanding of the formation of a radiation - induced cm region a better knowledge of the electric field",
    "is required , which takes effects like double peak and voltage drop over the neutral bulk region into account .",
    "conclusive hints could come from the recently developed method of edge - tct @xcite .",
    "the cce in the cm regime measured with 670  nm laser light was found to decrease at lower temperatures .",
    "the collected charge was found to be proportional to the deposited charge . using an x - y scan , the collected charge in the cm regime",
    "was found to be uniform with deviations on the percent level .",
    "long - term measurements showed that the cce remained stable over many days .",
    "the biggest challenge for the operation of detectors in the cm regime were micro discharges which occurred randomly at high voltages .",
    "improvements of the device technology to avoid them would be desirable .",
    "the noise of the tct baseline was found to increase above 650  v , but the snr was seen to improve due to cm up to 900  v for 670 and 1060  nm laser light .",
    "the relative width of charge spectra in the cm regime remained constant in the case of laser light , which shows that statistical fluctuations in the cm process are negligible for injected charge in the order of @xmath39  e. however , in the case of @xmath4-particles the relative width increased , probably due to varying charge deposited in the cm region .    to conclude",
    ", cm emerging in highly - irradiated detectors seems to be a promising option to overcome trapping at slhc fluences .",
    "very good detector performances were demonstrated with laser light .",
    "measurements with @xmath84-particles are in progress in order to study the collected charge in the cm regime for mip - like particles and the noise with a low - noise charge readout",
