    "with the discovery of increasingly high transition temperatures for conventional bcs superconductors , it is of interest to reassess and rederive bounds on the maximum possible @xmath0 .",
    "the goal in this area of research is to provide useful theoretical guidelines for the continued search for higher @xmath0 materials . in the work of cohen and anderson @xcite ,",
    "three different arguments give three different bounds on @xmath0 .",
    "the first of these arguments is simply based on the form of the mcmillan @xmath0 formula @xcite , which gives a maximum @xmath0 proportional to a material s average phonon energy @xmath4 for all values of the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath5 .",
    "however , the mcmillan formula is only valid in the @xmath6 regime and the correct eliashberg @xmath0 formula for large @xmath5 is @xcite @xmath7 which is unbounded in @xmath5 and potentially much larger than @xmath4 .",
    "the second argument of cohen and anderson postulates that stability requires the static dielectric function of a material to be positive , which leads to an upper bound on @xmath0 of approximately @xmath8 k. this bound and stability requirement are subsequently dismissed in the paper because of the neglect of local fields and umklapp processes , and further work @xcite has clarified that stability only requires a positive static dielectric function at long wavelengths . this second argument is refined and it is concluded that strong electron - phonon coupling is limited by an instability leading to insulating , covalently bonded materials .",
    "strong covalent bonds and superconductivity are not mutually exclusive , most notably in the case of mgb@xmath3 @xcite , but engineering their coexistence is a difficult materials problem . the final argument examines the structural instability resulting from phonon softening due to the same electron - phonon coupling that causes superconductivity . within the framework of a simple semiconductor model , it is shown that a phonon can go unstable before @xmath0 reaches a maximum , further reducing the bound from the naive @xmath9 .",
    "expressions relating phonon softening to @xmath5 have since been generalized @xcite and take the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a bare phonon frequency .",
    "these previous studies are revisited here in a more general framework to attempt to obtain more rigorous upper bounds on @xmath0 .",
    "first , the strong coupling limit of eliashberg theory is clarified through the use of upper and lower bounds on @xmath0 .",
    "an approximation for @xmath0 and electron - phonon coupling are directly related to the properties of the constituent atoms and their local environments within a material .",
    "we examine this measure of electron - phonon coupling as a function of electron energy to give insight into how a material might achieve a higher @xmath0 based on modifications of its electronic structure .",
    "we then derive a structural instability bound on @xmath0 through the calculation of the phonon softening caused by the same phonon - mediated pairing interaction that forms cooper pairs near the fermi surface .",
    "these methods are applied to probing the limits of superconductivity in three boron - carbon covalent metals : mgb@xmath3 , li@xmath12bc , and boron - doped diamond .",
    "the primary result of this paper is that there are two fundamental bounds on the transition temperature of a phonon - mediated superconductor , one set by lattice stability and the other by the total strength of available electron - phonon coupling .",
    "the lattice stability @xmath0 bound can be approximately derived just from equations ( [ simple_strong_tc ] ) and ( [ simple_phonon_soft ] ) . through substitution",
    ", the strong coupled @xmath0 formula can be written without @xmath5 as @xmath13 which is maximized as the electron - phonon coupling grows , @xmath14 , softening the phonon frequency towards instability , @xmath15 .",
    "this suggests that eliashberg theory does not have an unbounded @xmath0 as eq .",
    "( [ simple_strong_tc ] ) might lead us to believe , but rather it is proportional to a bare phonon frequency @xmath11 that can be larger than the softened phonon frequencies observed in a superconducting material .",
    "another form that eq .",
    "( [ simple_strong_tc ] ) is sometimes written as is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is an averaged atomic mass and @xmath18 is the mcmillan - hopfield parameter @xcite .",
    "the @xmath18 has units of a spring constant and is related to the strength of the electronic response of electrons at the fermi surface to perturbations of the atoms in the crystal . for a given @xmath17 ,",
    "a @xmath0 bound is set by the maximum @xmath18 possible considering all energies at the fermi level accessible through chemical doping or other physical modifications of the material .",
    "a large @xmath18 is required to approach the @xmath0 bound set by phonon stability in materials with strong covalent bonds and a large @xmath11 .",
    "approaching the phonon stability bound in systems containing strong covalent bonds will require careful material design .",
    "the @xmath0 calculated from the isotropic eliashberg equations has been the subject of both upper and lower bound studies @xcite . in the isotropic case , the @xmath0 of a material",
    "is uniquely determined by the eliashberg spectral function @xmath19 that characterizes the electron - phonon coupling and the coulomb parameter @xmath20 that quantifies the strength of the screened electron - electron coulomb repulsion .",
    "approximate formulas for @xmath0 usually represent the average electron - phonon coupling by @xmath21 and an average phonon frequency defined by a weighting function @xmath22 , @xmath23 at large temperatures , @xmath24 only appears in the eliashberg equations as @xmath25 , which is where the asymptotic @xmath0 formula of eq .",
    "( [ simple_strong_tc ] ) originates @xcite .",
    "if only @xmath26 is specified , @xmath0 can not be precisely determined , but it can be bounded from above and below , @xmath27 both bounds can be attained by an einstein model phonon spectrum , @xmath28 the lower bound corresponding to @xmath29 and the upper bound corresponding to @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the spectra associated with the two bounds are both unphysical pathologies , corresponding to the cases of maximum phonon softening and infinite phonon hardening .",
    "we attempt to tighten the bounds by independently constraining @xmath5 and @xmath31 as well as specifying @xmath20 .",
    "it is already known @xcite that the einstein spectrum maximizes @xmath0 for a given @xmath5 and @xmath31",
    ". however , the lower bound on @xmath0 is still zero even with these additional constraints .",
    "this is due to a pathological spectral function with two peaks , one approaching zero and the other diverging to infinity . in order to obtain a nontrivial lower bound , additional constraints need to be placed on the spectral function , and we choose the added restriction of a maximum phonon frequency @xmath32 that replaces the upper limit of integration in eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) and ( [ moments ] ) .",
    "the spectral function that minimizes @xmath0 at fixed @xmath5 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is numerically determined @xcite to be @xmath33 the phonon at @xmath34 contributes to @xmath5 but not to @xmath0 , making this effectively an einstein spectrum when calculating @xmath0 .",
    "the qualitative result here is that @xmath0 is maximized when the spectral function has no width and it is minimized when all the spectral weight is pushed to the edges of the allowed frequency interval .",
    "the stronger , more complicated @xmath0 bounds take the form @xmath35 the function @xmath36 smoothly interpolates between the @xmath37 weak coupling limit and the @xmath38 strong coupling limit and can be empirically fit to @xmath39 for @xmath40 , otherwise @xmath41 .",
    "this functional form is chosen to balance simplicity and accuracy and to match exact analytic results @xcite for @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the coefficients were chosen based on a least squares fit on the interval @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the average root - mean - squared deviation of @xmath46 is @xmath47 and the max deviation is @xmath48 .",
    "upper and lower bounds ( assuming @xmath49 ) with the mcmillan formula for an einstein spectrum of frequency @xmath4 with a varying electron - phonon coupling strength @xmath5 and @xmath50 . ]",
    "we plot the upper and lower bounds of @xmath0 for a reasonable but arbitrary @xmath49 as well as the mcmillan formula for an einstein spectrum in figure [ fig_bounds ] .",
    "the mcmillan formula deviates perceptibly from the upper bound around @xmath51 , by @xmath52 the deviation is roughly @xmath53 , and after @xmath54 it passes below the lower bound chosen for the figure .",
    "the relative width of the @xmath0 bound , @xmath55 , is largest at weak coupling .",
    "it has been observed that @xmath0 is more accurately proportional to a logarithmically averaged phonon frequency , @xmath56 , rather than @xmath32 or @xmath57 in the weak - coupling regime @xcite . as a result of that analysis , the most widely used formula for calculating @xmath0 is the mcmillan formula modified to include a log - averaged phonon frequency . in the strong coupling regime that is of more interest here , @xmath58 , both upper and lower bounds on @xmath0 are proportional to @xmath59 and converge as @xmath5 grows .    to complete our discussion of @xmath0 bounds , we need to address the effects of anisotropy .",
    "the anisotropy of the eliashberg spectral function causes an increase in @xmath0 from that calculated in the isotropic approximation @xcite .",
    "the reason for this enhancement is an increase in @xmath5 due to anisotropy , most notably essential for describing the superconductivity in mgb@xmath3 @xcite , raising @xmath5 from 0.77 to 1.01 .",
    "the simplest model in which to consider this effect is a multiband superconductor , which introduces a band index to the eliashberg equations @xcite .",
    "there is a separate gap value for each band @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath5 and @xmath62 are separated into phonon processes that couple band @xmath60 to band @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65_{ij } \\equiv 2\\int_0^{\\infty}{\\alpha^2 f_{ij}(\\omega ) \\omega d\\omega}.\\ ] ] as in the isotropic case , for high temperatures the eliashberg equations only contain @xmath24 in terms of the form @xmath66_{ij}/t^2 $ ] . correspondingly , the simple bounds on @xmath0 are the same as eq .",

    "the lower bound of eq .",
    "( [ tc_bound ] ) can not be lowered by anisotropy and still applies in the anisotropic case . for simple calculations of @xmath0 upper bounds ,",

    "( [ einstein_spectrum ] ) , any anisotropic perturbations at fixed @xmath77 and @xmath79 can only redistribute the magnitude of the largest eigenvalues of @xmath67 and @xmath66_{ij}$ ] to smaller eigenvalues and thus only decrease @xmath0 .",
    "another important effect of anisotropy is in reducing the effects of @xmath20 on @xmath0 @xcite , the effective @xmath20 being determined by the distribution of the gap between bands , @xmath80 which in cases of extreme anisotropy can completely nullify the effect of @xmath20 .",
    "the end result is that the upper bound of eq .",
    "( [ tc_bound ] ) still applies to the anisotropic case provided that @xmath77 and @xmath79 replace the isotropic values and @xmath20 is set to zero .",
    "the anisotropic case now provides additional difficulty in the strong coupling limit because @xmath62 and @xmath78 do nt necessarily converge to each other and there is no unique simple measure of @xmath0 that is independent of anisotropic details . rather than resort to a more complicated expression",
    ", we examine the accuracy of @xmath5 and @xmath77 in a common anisotropic scenario .",
    "most conventional bcs superconductors are reasonably isotropic and one of the most anisotropic bcs superconductors known , mgb@xmath3 , fits well into a two band model @xcite . in this model , there is a strongly coupled @xmath81-band fermi sheet and a more weakly coupled @xmath82-band sheet . we take a more extreme version of this two band case , where the second band has no electron - phonon coupling at the fermi surface . in this case , the correct anisotropic result is @xmath66_{11}$ ] , which is also equal to the upper bound @xmath78 .",
    "the isotropic approximation @xmath62 equals @xmath83_{11}$ ] and can substantially underestimate the correct result depending on how much of the density of states at the fermi level lies in the decoupled band . in general , @xmath77 will be correct for single - gap superconductors and the error for multi - gap superconductors will be proportional to the total magnitude of all gaps excluding the largest .",
    "for this reason , we consider @xmath78 to be a better approximation than @xmath62 for calculations of anisotropic superconductivity .    assuming that we are able to enter the strong coupling regime , we are guaranteed to increase @xmath0 uniformly if we focus solely on increasing @xmath78 .",
    "this approach works especially well if we consider classes of materials with similar @xmath11 because eq .",
    "( [ simple_phonon_soft ] ) shows that increasing @xmath78 also increases @xmath77 due to phonon softening .",
    "it can also be detrimental to independently consider @xmath77 and @xmath79 in classes of materials such as is portrayed in eq .",
    "( [ min_spectrum ] ) .",
    "increasing the coupling to the very low frequency modes of a system most efficiently increases @xmath77 but does nt raise @xmath0 .",
    "in such an extreme case , it is more useful to have a metric for superconductivity that is insensitive to low frequency coupling , which is true of @xmath78 .",
    "we make no attempts to model @xmath20 as it is typically between @xmath84 and @xmath85 in metals @xcite and variations of this magnitude can only change @xmath0 by a few percent in the strong coupling regime .",
    "we are left with a single quantity to optimize , @xmath78 , that serves as a simple metric for enhancing @xmath0 .",
    "as was first pointed out by mcmillan @xcite , the quantity @xmath62 is independent of the details of the phonon spectrum .",
    "it can be written as a sum of atomic contributions @xmath86 where @xmath60 is summed over all atoms in the unit cell , @xmath87 are the atomic masses , and @xmath88 are the mcmillan - hopfield parameters of the atoms .",
    "the quantity @xmath78 is also independent of the phonon spectrum and can also be written as a sum of effective mcmillan - hopfield parameters , @xmath89 from the definition of @xmath78 in eq .",

    "@xmath88 is less than or equal to @xmath96 with equality occurring in the isotropic case .",
    "we can generalize the electron - phonon coupling parameter @xmath96 to electrons away from the fermi surface , at an energy @xmath2 , simply by substituting @xmath97 , @xmath98 this expression has the form of a density of states weighted by the sensitivity of the electronic states to atomic displacements . whereas @xmath99 and @xmath100 for all non - metallic materials , @xmath101 will have non - zero values and potentially interesting features for all materials . by looking at this coupling parameter as a function of energy",
    ", we can immediately examine rigid - band doping scenarios and get a better sense of the magnitude of hypothetical electron - phonon couplings .",
    "the effects of anisotropy have been considered in deriving @xmath96 , but so far neglected is phonon anharmonicity , which can be of equal importance in materials such as mgb@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "anharmonicity is important for  soft \" phonon modes where the average displacement of atoms is large enough that it samples the non - harmonic terms of the potential energy surface .",
    "eliashberg theory can be formally reformulated to account for anharmonicity @xcite , where the largest effect is typically an increase in phonon frequencies and other corrections contain multi - phonon processes and debye - waller factors .",
    "the most common approach taken is the inclusion of anharmonic phonon frequencies wherever phonon frequencies appear in eliashberg theory . at this level of correction , @xmath96 and thus the quantity @xmath78",
    "are unchanged as they are independent of the phonon spectrum .",
    "anharmonic corrections can of course shift the average phonon frequency @xmath79 , but @xmath77 will correspondingly change such that their product remains constant . taking into account more anharmonic effects , @xmath96 can also change because @xmath102 in eq .",
    "( [ eta_definition ] ) is dependent on atomic positions and will be affected by large atomic displacements . the anharmonic phonon frequency correction is significant because as a phonon softens the harmonic change in energy with phonon displacement , @xmath103 , gets small and the phonon frequency becomes dominated by anharmonic corrections proportional to @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the magnitude of the average phonon mode displacement .",
    "in contrast , the anharmonic @xmath96 correction typically will not be important because the harmonic value does not get small as phonons soften and as is shown in section [ phonon_soft_section ] , one mechanism of phonon softening is actually related to large @xmath96 values .",
    "the only anharmonic effects we will consider are corrections to @xmath79 and not @xmath96 .    to calculate @xmath101 using a modern electronic structure code , we must find an approximation to @xmath91 in eq .",
    "( [ eta2_definition ] ) . the potential due to the displacement of a single atom in a crystal breaks translational symmetry and is a difficult quantity to compute using codes that rely on periodicity .",
    "a reasonable approximation to this single atom displacement is the displacement of a single atom per unit cell within a sufficiently large supercell of the material of interest .",
    "this displacement is a zone - center perturbation and the matrix elements in eq .",
    "( [ eta2_definition ] ) are simply obtained from first order perturbation theory on the band energies , @xmath106 this calculation is no more difficult than decomposing the force on each atom into its individual band and @xmath107-point contributions and then calculating a density of states .",
    "the @xmath96 obtained from this procedure does not require the rigid - muffin - tin approximation ( rmta ) often made in other more simplified calculations of electron - phonon coupling @xcite . by utilizing a supercell approximation , we assume spatial locality of electron - phonon coupling as in the rmta , but here this assumption can be systematically verified and improved by increasing the size of the supercell . the calculations in this paper",

    "this relation reflects the common wisdom based on the bcs model that a large density of states at @xmath114 and light elements are what lead to a high @xmath0 .",
    "it also helps to give a simple qualitative picture of electron - phonon coupling by allowing us to focus on a single electronic state and atom at a time .",
    "if the electron occupies a single orbital of this atom , its charge distribution will be symmetric about the atomic center and it will contribute no net force to the atom .",
    "this is related to the @xmath115 angular momentum sum rule in the electron - phonon coupling calculations of hopfield @xcite .",

    "we can next examine the effect of bond ionicity on @xmath117 by comparing diamond with boron nitride in a zinc - blende structure in figure [ fig_bn ] .",
    "although their bond lengths are very similar , boron nitride has a more ionic , less covalent bond than diamond and the @xmath119 and @xmath18 values are correspondingly reduced .",
    "all these materials share the diamond ( zinc - blende ) structure and contain similar peaks in @xmath1 above and below the fermi level , due to strong coupling associated with the anti - bonding and bonding states respectively .",
    "besides changes in bond strength and ionicity , we can also change the character of a covalent bond by changing the structure of a system .",
    "carbon in graphite has @xmath120 bonding instead of the @xmath121 bonding of the diamond structure . in this structure",

    "the features of @xmath1 do not directly correspond to density of states features in the diamond - structure examples , and the deviation is even more pronounced in graphite .",
    "in particular , the maximum in the valence density of states of graphite associated with a van hove singularity of graphene is not associated with a maximum in electron - phonon coupling .     for simple cubic tight binding in d=1,2,3 dimensions .",

    "there is a large variation of electron - phonon coupling in the examples studied , a factor of five increase in the maximum of @xmath1 in going from aluminum to silicon and another factor of five increase in carbon over silicon .",
    "these variations of magnitude can be approximately reproduced based on scaling arguments .",
    "the first approximation we make is to assume that @xmath108 in eq .",

    "this allows us to separate out the @xmath129 sum and equate it to the density of states per spin times the variation in the electronic energy , @xmath130 the sensitivity of electronic energy to atomic displacements is approximately related to the hydrostatic deformation potential - the sensitivity of electronic energy to change in the volume of the unit cell times the volume - divided by a length scale , in this case the bond length . in a free electron gas , the standard result @xcite for the hydrostatic deformation potential is @xmath131 .",

    "the possibility of a high @xmath0 becomes more probable with increasing @xmath101 and decreasing @xmath87 for the atoms constituting a material . in going from silicon to carbon in a diamond structure",
    "we see that both these parameters favor the lighter element . the lightest elements that can form strong covalent bonds under ambient conditions are hydrogen , beryllium , boron , carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , and fluorine .",
    "these are the elements that should make up the covalent framework central to the idea of a covalent metal superconductor .",

    "even if it is possible to physically modify a system and effectively shift its fermi level , the modification might also change @xmath1 from its initial value , for better or worse .",
    "an additional problem arises in molecular crystals where weakening intermolecular hopping and narrow bands can cause a divergence in both @xmath122 and @xmath1 and a breakdown of eliashberg theory . in the case of doped c@xmath136 solids ,",
    "it is believed @xcite that non - adiabatic effects and a mott insulator transition are required to fully account for some observed behavior .",
    "these are electronic effects beyond the scope of this paper that potentially bound @xmath0 by electronic energy scales . more relevant to non - molecular crystals with a wider electronic bandwidth ,",
    "we next examine a fundamental instability of the phonon - mediated superconducting state that bounds @xmath0 by a smaller , phonon energy scale .",
    "the phonon softening due to electron - phonon interactions can lead to a structural instability that sets an upper limit to the possible @xmath0 of a material .",
    "phonon softening is defined as a change in phonon frequencies from some well - defined bare frequency to the actual frequencies present in a material .",
    "the early research on phonon softening took the bare phonons to be of purely electrostatic origin , as either coming from a screened ion - ion interaction @xcite or the ions and frozen valence electrons @xcite . a recent study",
    "@xcite has included quantum effects in the definition of the bare phonons , using metallic screening with an insulating electronic susceptibility .",
    "since superconductivity is the result of interactions between phonons and electrons near the fermi surface , we will define the bare phonon frequencies here by isolating and removing all electronic contributions to phonon frequencies coming from the fermi surface .    to calculate the phonon spectrum of a material we must first consider its dynamical matrix , @xmath137 where @xmath138 are the atom indices and @xmath139 are the cartesian coordinate indices .",
    "the first two terms are the classical electrostatic contribution between ions and a fixed electronic charge background , while the third contains contributions coming from the electronic response .",
    "all fermi surface contributions are contained within the third term of the dynamical matrix , and we rewrite it in a more symmetric manner using the chain rule , @xmath140 the middle term , @xmath141 , is the electron susceptibility , usually denoted as @xmath142 , that quantifies the response of the electron density to a change in the background potential .",
    "if the contribution to @xmath142 due to the fermi surface is small , then it can be related to the fermi surface contribution to the irreducible susceptibility @xmath143 through perturbation theory @xcite , @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the inverse dielectric function of the material and @xmath146 is its hermitian conjugate .",

    "the fermi surface does not have an infinitesimal effect on phonon frequencies , but rather it affects an infinitesimal number of phonons . for a phonon of wavevector @xmath159 , we would calculate the softening due to the fermi surface by taking the expectation value of @xmath158 with respect to the phonon displacement vector .",

    "all the electrons in a material can play a role in softening the phonon frequencies from the ionic plasma frequencies , and the fermi surface is not independent of the rest of the electronic structure .",
    "these additional phonon softening effects are not directly related to the fermi surface and must be handled separately for different classes of materials .",
    "for example , in metallic li@xmath12bc @xcite there is an essentially constant softening for phonons from @xmath162 to @xmath163 .",
    "we imagine that for a hypothetical well - engineered superconductor , all material - specific phonon softening is designed so that it does nt lead to any structural instabilities , leaving only @xmath158 as the fundamentally limiting cause of phonon instability .    with several more manipulations ,",
    "the phonon softening due to electron - phonon coupling can be directly related back to a bound on @xmath0 .",
    "we first relate @xmath158 to the softening of an individual phonon mode with displacement vector @xmath164 , @xmath165 summing over all phonon modes at the gamma point , we have a complete basis of gamma point atomic displacements and can relate the phonon softening back to the total electron phonon coupling , @xmath166 assuming @xmath96 has been calculated using eq .",

    "( [ weak_bound ] ) to get @xmath167 this phonon softening @xmath0 bound gets large as more phonons are softened and as the magnitude of the softening increases .",
    "however , the total phonon softening is related to the total electron - phonon coupling strength , which is itself independent of the phonon spectrum .",
    "phonon softening becomes the relevant bound on @xmath0 only when there is enough electron - phonon coupling in a material to drive a phonon mode to instability before the electron - phonon coupling strength is maximized .",
    "the identification of this one  achilles heel \" mode and its subsequent destabilization are required to correctly interpret eq .",
