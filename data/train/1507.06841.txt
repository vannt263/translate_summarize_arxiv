    "in social sciences , people in social organizations ( e.g. , a country or a company ) can be categorized into different rankings of socioeconomic tiers based on factors like wealth , income , social status , occupation , power , etc . in this paper",
    ", we will take `` company '' as an example and the internal hierarchical structure of employees in a company can be outlined with _ company organizational chart _ formally .",
    "most company organizational charts are usually tree - structure diagrams with ceo at the root , executive vice presidents ( evps ) at the second level and so forth .",
    "company organizational chart shows the company internal management structure as well as the relationships and relative ranks of employees with different positions / jobs , which is a common visual depiction of how a company is organized .    nowadays , to facilitate the collaboration and communication among employees , a new type of online social networks named _ enterprise social networks _",
    "( esns ) has been adopted inside the firewalls of many corporations .",
    "a representative example of online esns is yammer .",
    "over 500,000 businesses around the world are now using yammer , including 85% of the fortune 500 .",
    "yammer provides employees with various enterprise social network services to help them deal with daily work issues and contains abundant heterogeneous information generated by employees online social activities .",
    "* problem studied * : company internal organizational chart is usually confidential to the public for the privacy and security reasons . in this paper , we want to infer the organizational chart of a company based on the heterogeneous information in online esns launched in the company , and the problem is formally named as the _ nference of rganization hart _ ( ioc ) problem .    to help illustrate the ioc problem more clearly , we also give an example in figure  [ fig : example ] , where the left plot is about an online esn adopted in a company and the right plot shows the company s organizational chart . in the esn , users can have different types of social activities , e.g. , follow other users , join groups , write / reply / like posts , etc .",
    "meanwhile , in the organizational chart , employees are connected by supervision links from managers to subordinates , who are organized into a rooted tree of depth @xmath1 with ceo `` adam '' at the root . in companies , managers",
    "can usually supervise several subordinates simultaneously , while each subordinate only reports to one single manager .",
    "for instance , in figure  [ fig : example ] , ceo `` adam '' manages `` bob '' and `` candy '' concurrently , while `` david '' only needs to report to `` bob '' .",
    "the ioc problem is an interesting yet important problem . besides inferring company organizational chart ,",
    "it can also be applied in other real - world concrete applications : ( 1 ) identifying the command structures of terrorist organizations @xcite based on the communication / traffic networks of their members .",
    "the command structures of terrorist organizations are usually pyramid diagrams outlining their support systems consisting of the _ leaders _ , _ operational cadre _ , _ active supporters _ and _ passive supporters _ @xcite .",
    "uncovering their internal operational structure and determining roles of members will be helpful for conducting precise strikes against their key leaders and avoid the tragic events , like 9/11 @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) inferring the social hierarchies of animals based on their observed interaction networks @xcite .",
    "many animals ( like , mammals , birds and insect species ) are usually organized into dominance hierarchies .",
    "identifying and understanding the organizational hierarchies of animals will be helpful to design and carry out effective conservation measures to protect them .",
    "albeit its importance , ioc is a novel problem and we are the first to propose to study it based on online esns .",
    "the ioc problem is totally different from existing works : ( 1 ) `` _ _ hierarchy detection in social networks _ _ '' @xcite , which only studies the division of the regular users of the social networks into different hierarchies , who are not actually involved in any organizations ; ( 2 ) `` _ _ organizational intrusion _ _ '' @xcite , which focuses on attacking organizations and attaining company internal information only ; and ( 3 ) `` _ _ inferring offline hierarchy from social networks _ _ '' @xcite , which merely infers fragments of offline hierarchical ties in _ homogeneous _ networks , instead of reconstructing the whole organizational chart .",
    "different from all these works , in this paper , we aim at recovering the complete organizational chart of a company ( including both the hierarchical tiers of employees and the supervision links from managers to subordinates ) based on the _ heterogeneous _ information about the employees in online esns",
    ".        meanwhile , to guarantee the smooth operations of companies , the inferred organizational chart needs to meet certain structural requirements @xcite , including both ( 1 ) macro - level depth requirement , and ( 2 ) micro - level width requirement .",
    "two classical organizational structures adopted by companies are the vertical structure and the horizontal structure @xcite .",
    "vertical organizational structure with well - defined chains of command clearly outlines the responsibilities of each employee but will result in delays in information delivery @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , horizontal organizational structure with flat command system involves everyone in decision making but will lead to difficulties in coordinating the activities of different departments @xcite .",
    "for instance , based on the input social network shown in plot a of figure  [ fig : balance_example ] , we give two extreme cases of the vertical and horizontal organizational charts without depth regulation in plots b and c respectively , both of which will lead to serious management problems for large companies involving tens of thousands employees .",
    "proper regulation of the inferred organizational chart s depth ( i.e. , the macro - level depth requirement ) is generally desired . on the other hand ,",
    "most employees in companies need good supervisors to coach and instruct their daily work , but the number of subordinates each manager can supervise is limited , which can be determined by their management capacities , available time and energy . rationally regulating the allocation of supervision workload among managers ( i.e. , the micro - level width requirement ) can improve the management effectiveness significantly . for instance , in plot d of figure  [ fig : balance_example ] , we show an inferred organizational chart with depth regulation but no subordinate allocation regulation . in the plot ,",
    "users in esn are stratified into @xmath0 tiers ( which is relatively reasonable compared to the extreme cases in plots b and c ) but the employees management workloads at tier @xmath0 are all assigned to one single manager , which may be beyond his / her management ability .    despite its importance and novelty ,",
    "the ioc problem is very hard to solve due to the following challenges :    * _ regulated social stratification _ : _ effective social stratification _ to partition users into different hierarchical arrangements ( i.e. , identifying the relative manager - subordinate roles of employees ) while meeting the macro - level depth requirement is the prerequisite for addressing the ioc problem . * _ supervision link inference _ : supervision link is a new type of link merely existing from managers to their subordinates .",
    "predicting the existence of potential _ supervision links _ with the heterogeneous information in esns is still an open problem . *",
    "_ regulated supervision workload allocation _ : to maximize the management effectiveness and efficiency , the number of subordinates each manager can supervise is limited by the management threshold @xmath2 . in other words , supervision links in organizational chart have an inherent _ k - to - one _ constraint .    to address all the above challenges ,",
    "a new unsupervised organizational chart inference framework named create ( hr covr ) is proposed in this paper .",
    "several new concepts ( e.g. , `` _ _ class transcendence social links _ _ '' , `` _ _ matthew effect based constraint _ _ '' and `` _ _ chart depth regulation constraint _ _ '' ) will be introduced and create resolves the _ regulated social stratification _",
    "challenge by minimizing the existence of class transcendence social links in esns .",
    "create tackles the _ supervision link inference _ challenge by aggregating multiple social meta paths in the esn between to consecutive social hierarchies .",
    "finally , create handles the _ regulated supervision workload allocation _ challenge by applying _ network flow _ to match consecutive social hierarchies to preserve the _ k - to - one _ constraint on _ supervision links_.    the remaining parts of the paper are organized as follows . in section  [ sec : formulation ] , we will define some important terminologies and the ioc problem .",
    "method create will be introduced in section  [ sec : method ] .",
    "extensive experiment results are available in section  [ sec : experiment ] .",
    "finally , we describe the related works in section  [ sec : relatedwork ] and conclude this paper in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we will introduce the formal definitions of `` _ _ heterogeneous social network _ _ '' and `` _ _ organizational chart _ _ '' at first and then define the ioc problem with these two concepts .",
    "* definition 1 * ( heterogeneous social networks ) : a _ heterogeneous social network _ can be represented as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the sets of different types of nodes and complex links among these nodes in the network respectively .    as introduced in section  [ sec : introduction ] , users in online esns ( e.g. , yammer ) have various types of social activities , e.g. , follow other users , join groups , write / reply / like online posts , etc . as a result , yammer can be represented as a _ heterogeneous social network _",

    "based on the definitions of _ heterogeneous social network _ and _ organizational chart _ , we can define the ioc problem formally as follows :    * definition 3 * ( organizational chart inference ( ioc ) ) : given an online esn @xmath3 launched in a company , the ioc problem aims at inferring the most likely organizational chart @xmath9 of the company , where @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is the user set in network @xmath7 ) .",
    "furthermore , considering that the node set as well as the root node in @xmath12 are fixed , the ioc problem actually aims at inferring the @xmath15 most likely _ supervision links _",
    "@xmath11 among employees . the inferred supervision links together with the node set @xmath10 as well as the @xmath16 node can recover the original organizational chart @xmath9 of the company",
    "considering that supervision links exist merely between managers and subordinates , we propose to stratify users in enterprise social networks into different _ social classes _ to identify their relative manager - subordinate roles in subsection  [ subsec : stratification ] .",
    "macro - level depth requirement of the inferred chart is achieved with the _ depth regulation constraint _ in the social stratification objective function .",
    "potential supervision links can be inferred between employees in consecutive classes by aggregating social meta paths among employees in the esn in subsection  [ subsec : metapath ] . to preserve the _ k - to - one _ constraint on supervision links ( i.e. , the micro - level width requirement ) , redundant non - existing supervision links will be pruned in subsection  [ subsec : networkflow ] .",
    "generally , as shown in figure  [ fig : framework ] , framework create has three steps : ( 1 ) regulated social stratification , ( 2 ) supervision link inference , and ( 3 ) regulated social class matching , which will all be introduced in this section .",
    "supervision links merely exist between managers and subordinates .",
    "division of users into hierarchies to identify their relative manager - subordinate roles can shrink the supervision link inference space greatly .",
    "the process of hierarchizing users in online esn is called _ social stratification _ formally .",

    "* definition 5 * ( social class ) : _ social class _ is a term used by social stratification models in social science and the most common ones are the upper , middle , and lower classes @xcite . in this paper , we define _ social class _ of users in online esns as their management level in the company , where ceo belongs to social class 1 , evps belong to class 2 , and so forth .    in social stratification",

    ", subordinates tend to follow their managers , while people in management are reluctant to initiate the friendship with their subordinates @xcite .",

    "when @xmath38 becomes larger ( from @xmath128 to @xmath129 ) , the _ structure regulation constraint _ starts to matter more and the social stratification accuracy goes up steadily and achieve the highest value at @xmath130 , i.e. , the default value of @xmath38 in later experiments .",
    "create performs better as @xmath38 increases shows that the _ structure regulation constraint _ can stretch the organizational structure and stratify users in their correct social classes .",
    "however , as @xmath38 further increases ( i.e. , from @xmath129 to @xmath131 ) , the accuracy achieved by create decreases dramatically .",
    "the reason can be that larger @xmath38 stretches the organizational structure too much and put lots users into the wrong social classes .",
    "for example , it is nearly impossible for users to achieve @xmath131 as the average social class , which is actually the largest social class in the sampled fully aligned organizational chart .",
    "social stratification results of create and asd are given in figures  [ eg_fig9_comp_level]-[eg_fig_comp1 ] , where figure  [ eg_fig9_comp_level ] shows the results achieved by create and asd at each social class ( evaluated by precision and recall respectively ) and figure  [ eg_fig_comp1 ] shows their overall performance ( evaluated by accuracy , mae , mse and @xmath125 ) .",
    "from the microscopic perspective , we observes that create performs better than asd consistently at all social classes .",
    "create achieves both @xmath132 precision and @xmath132 recall at social classes @xmath133 , i.e. , create identifies the top @xmath1 management levels of the company correctly .",
    "the performance of create at other social classes is also very promising .",
    "for instance , the precision scores achieved by create at social classes @xmath134 ( besides @xmath133 ) are either @xmath132 or close to @xmath132 and the recall scores of create at social classes @xmath135 are also very high , which all outperform those of asd with significant advantages .    from a macroscopic perspective , the performance of create in stratifying the whole user set in esn is very excellent and much better than that of asd . the accuracy , mae , mse and @xmath125 scores achieved by create are @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 respectively , which all outperforms those achieved by asd .",
    "for example , the accuracy achieved create is almost the triple of that obtained by asd , while the mae and mse obtained by create are merely the @xmath140 and @xmath141 of those achieved by asd . in addition",
    ", asd gets negative @xmath125 scores in identifying social classes of users in esns , which denotes that the identified users social classes are massively disordered and have no linear correlation with the social class ground truth at all .",
    "create has proved its excellent effectiveness in stratifying users in esns , based on which , we further study its performance in inferring the potential supervision links between pairs of consecutive social classes , whose results are evaluated by auc , precision@100 in table  [ tab : result1 ] as well as by recall , precision and f1 in figure  [ eg_fig_comp2 ] .    in table  [ tab : result1 ] , we compare create ( of different management thresholds @xmath2 ) with all the other baseline methods , where create ( with parameter @xmath142 and @xmath143 ) performs the best .",
    "compared with create - sl ( or create - s ) , create ( or create - sm ) which has the matching step can identify supervision links more effectively .",
    "for instance , create ( with @xmath144 ) outperforms create - sl by over @xmath145 in auc and @xmath146 in precision@100 , and create - sm ( with parameter @xmath144 ) outperforms create - s with remarkable advantages .",
    "it demonstrates that matching step can effectively prune non - existing supervision links and preserve the micro - level width requirement ( i.e. , the _ k - to - one _ constraint ) .",
    "compared with create - sm and create - s , create which infers the potential supervision links based on heterogeneous information in esns instead of merely regarding the social links as supervision link candidates achieves much better results .",
    "for example , in table  [ tab : result1 ] , the auc of create is @xmath147 higher than that of create - sm and create - s , while the precision@100 of create is also roughly @xmath148 higher as well .",
    "in addition , in figures  [ eg_fig_comp2 ] , the recall , precision and f1 obtained by create is almost triple of those achieved by create - sm .",
    "it confirms the argument that heterogeneous information in esns can capture the relationships among colleagues ( especially between managers and subordinates ) .",
    "in addition , we also compare create with traditional unsupervised link prediction methods , including cn , jc and aa , and the advantages of create are very obvious according to table  [ tab : result1 ] : create can outperform all these unsupervised link prediction methods with significant advantages .",
    "in social class matching , the management threshold parameter @xmath2 plays a key role in constraining the number of supervision links connected to each managers .",
    "the sensitivity of parameter @xmath2 will be analyzed in this section , where the results achieved by create ( with different @xmath2s ) evaluated by different metrics are available in figure  [ eg_fig_k ] .",
    "small management threshold @xmath2 ( e.g. , @xmath149 ) limits each manager s subordinate number to @xmath149 and will preserve the supervision links with extremely high likelihood only but may miss many promising ones .",
    "however , as threshold @xmath2 increases , more links with high likelihood will be preserved and the metric scores increase consistently . meanwhile , when the threshold @xmath2 goes to @xmath150 , the performance of create degrades dramatically .",
    "the possible reason can be that , with larger threshold , each manager can have too many supervision links , which may exceed the subordinates they have in the real - world .",
