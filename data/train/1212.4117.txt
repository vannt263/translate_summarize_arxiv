    "graphene , the two dimensional layer of the carbon atoms with honeycomb lattice structure , has attracted a great deal of attention as a new promising material for nanoelectronics , since its experimental realization a few years ago@xcite .",
    "graphene has a zero - gap semiconducting band structure in which the charge carriers behave like 2d massless dirac fermions with a pseudo - relativistic chiral property .",
    "the carrier type , [ electron - like ( @xmath1 ) or hole - like ( @xmath2 ) ] and its density can be tuned by means of electrical gate or doping of underlying substrate . most of the peculiar properties of graphene is the result of its massless dirac spectrum of the low - lying electron - hole excitations , which in addition to the regular spin appear to come endowed with the two quantum degrees of freedom , the so called pseudospin and valley .",
    "the pseudospin represents the sublattice degree of freedom of the graphene s honeycomb structure , and the valley defines the corresponding degree of freedom in the reciprocal lattice@xcite . the effect of these additional quantum numbers has already been proven to be drastically important in several quantum transport phenomena in graphene , including quantum hall effect@xcite , conductance quantization@xcite , klein tunneling@xcite and quantum shot noise@xcite .",
    "interestingly , the pseudospin and the valley degrees of freedom in graphene have been proposed separately to be used for the controlling electronic devices in the same way as the electron spin is used in spintronic and quantum computing .",
    "et al._@xcite demonstrated an electrostatically controlled valley filter effect in graphene nanoribbons with zigzag edge which can be used for realizing valley valve structures in valleytronics ( valley - based electronics ) applications . on the other hand ,",
    "a pseudospin - based version of a spin valve has been proposed in monolayer graphene and bilayer graphene@xcite , which can be used for realizing pseudospintronics in graphene .",
    "also , the possibility of an interaction driven spontaneous breaking of the pseudospin symmetry , which can lead to the realization of pseudomagnetic states in monolayer and bilayer graphene , has been studied recently@xcite .",
    "recent experimental progresses in proximity - inducing superconductivity in graphene by fabrication of transparent contacts between a graphene monolayer and a superconductor , has provided a unique possibility to study relativistic - like superconductivity and proximity effect@xcite .",
    "peculiarity of andreev reflection ( ar)@xcite , conversion of the electron into the hole excitations at a normal metallic - superconducting ( n / s ) interface , has been studied in graphene - based n / s junctions by beenakker , who demonstrated that unlike the retro ar for highly doped graphene or a n metal , the dominant process for undoped",
    "n graphene is the specular ar@xcite . in the case of a graphene ferromagnetic - superconducting ( f / s ) junction ,",
    "the situation is dramatically different from common f / s junctions where the subgap andreev conductance decreases with increasing the exchange energy @xmath3 from its value for n / s junction and vanishes for a half metallic ferromagnet with @xmath4 , where all carriers have the same spin@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that for the exchange energies higher than the chemical potential @xmath5 , a peculiar spin - resolved andreev - klein process at graphene f / s interface can result in an enhancement of the subgap andreev conductance by @xmath3 , up to the point at which the conductance at low voltages @xmath6 is larger than its value for the corresponding n / s structure@xcite . also , the corresponding andreev - klein bound states in graphene s / f / s structure are responsible for the long - range josephson coupling of f graphene@xcite",
    ". moreover , specific nonlocal proximity effect takes place in graphene - based superconducting heterostructures mediating purely by a nonlocal process known as crossed andreev reflection ( car ) which creates a spatially entangled electron - hole pair .",
    "while in ordinary nonrelativistic systems the small value of car conductance is canceled by the conductance of elastic electron cotunneling ( ct ) process , it can be enhanced in ballistic graphene n / s / n and f / s / f structures@xcite .    in this paper , we study the effect of the pseudospin degree of freedom on quantum transport in gapped monolayer graphene , that presents a pseudospin symmetry broken ferromagnet ( pf ) , with a finite pseudospin magnetization oriented vertically to the graphene plane .",
    "the magnitude of the pseudomagnetization ( pm ) depends on the chemical potential and its direction can be switched by changing the type of doping ( electron @xmath1 or hole @xmath2 ) .",
    "based on this observation , we propose a nonmagnetic pseudospin valve structure ( pf",
    "/ n / pf ) with remarkably large pseudomagnetoresistance ( pmr ) in analogy to the giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) in magnetic multilayers@xcite , which can be perfect for chemical potentials close to the energy gap ( @xmath7 ) and appropriate lengths of the n region .",
    "more importantly , we show that the perfect pseudospin valve effect can be reached even in higher chemical potentials @xmath8 by applying an appropriate bias voltage .",
    "we further demonstrate the unusually long - range penetration of the equilibrium and non - equilibrium pseudospin polarization into the n region by proximity to a pf , that is in clear contrast to the induced magnetization in ordinary f / n junctions which decays exponentially within @xmath9@xcite .    moreover , we study the effect of the pseudospin on ar and the associated proximity effect in hybrid structures of pfs and a superconductor in s / pf and pf / s / pf geometries .",
    "we find that in graphene pf , due to the possibility for a small chemical potential @xmath10 , a peculiar ar occurs at s / pf interface which is associated with an inversion of the @xmath0 component of the carriers pseudospin vector , and that this has important consequences for the proximity effect .",
    "for an s / pf junction , we find that the andreev - klein reflection can enhance the pseudospin inverted andreev conductance by the energy gap @xmath11 to reach a limiting maximum value for @xmath12 , which depends on the bias voltage and can be larger than the value for the corresponding junction with no energy gap ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "this is similar to the behavior of andreev conductance with the exchange energy @xmath3 in a graphene f / s junction and approves that the energy gap @xmath11 in the band structure of normal graphene produces an effect similar to the exchange field in f graphene .",
    "we also demonstrate that depending on the energy @xmath14 of the incident electron , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , ar can be of retro or specular types , respectively , without or with the inversion of the @xmath0 component of the pseudospin vector .",
    "furthermore , the spatially - damped oscillatory behavior of the proximity density of states in pseudoferromagnetic side of the s / pf contact and the pseudospin switching effect in superconducting graphene pseudospin valve structure ( pf / s / pf ) confirm the crucial rule of the pseudospin in the gapped normal graphene and its similarity to the rule of spin in an f graphene .",

    "( [ pf wave function ] ) in the above equation , we find the total subgap dos inside the pseudoferromagnetic region for the case of ar with @xmath115 inversion as , @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the dos of a pseudoferromagnetic layer .",
    "( color online ) the behavior of the proximity density of states ( dos ) inside the pseudoferromagnetic region versus @xmath150 for different values of @xmath126 , when @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",

    "we see that there are two phenomena to consider in describing the spatial variations of @xmath154 , when an energy gap is present in the band structure of normal graphene .",
    "the first phenomenon is the short distance decay at the interface with a slope which increases by increasing @xmath126 .",
    "the other important phenomenon is the damped oscillation of @xmath154 , caused by the momentum shift between andreev correlated electron - hole pair with opposite @xmath115 directions .",
    "the period of oscillations is determined by @xmath155 , which is similar to an s / f structure where the period of dos oscillations in the ballistic limit is given @xmath156 @xcite .",
    "this shows the similarity of the effect of an spin - splitting exchange field @xmath3 with the energy gap @xmath11 , which behaves as a pseudospin - splitting field [ see eq .",
    "( [ dirach ] ) ] .",
    "we note that the appropriate method to probe the dos oscillations in s / pf junction is the local scanning of the surface of the pseudoferromagnetic region by scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) .",
    "so the spatially damped oscillatory behavior of the dos inside the pseudoferromagnetic region confirms that the energy gap @xmath11 in the band structure of normal graphene produces an effect similar to the exchange field in f graphene .",
    "finally , we study the nonlocal quantum transport in pf / s / pf junction that constitutes a superconducting pseudospin valve structure . we calculate the normal and andreev reflection amplitudes ( @xmath74 and @xmath157 , respectively ) in the left pf and the transmission amplitudes of the electron ( @xmath158 ) and the hole ( @xmath159 ) into the right pf of both parallel and antiparallel configurations , by matching the wave functions of the two pfs and s region at the two interfaces ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) , @xmath160 here , the left pf , s region , and the right pf are signed by 1,2 , and 3 , respectively , and @xmath161 is the solution of the dirac equation for conduction ( valance)band hole of the @xmath1- ( @xmath2-)doped pf ) . replacing the reflection and transmission amplitudes in btk formula , we obtain the conductance of ar , ct , and car processes for parallel and antiparallel alignments of pms . in car process an electron excitation and a hole excitation at two separate pseudoferromagnetic leads are coupled by means of andreev scattering processes at two spatially distinct interfaces .",
    "we find that for all incoming waves with two bias voltages @xmath162 , ar process is suppressed and the cross - conductance in the right pf depends crucially on the configuration of pms in the two pfs .",
    "we find that the transport is mediated purely by ct in parallel configuration and changes to the pure car in the low energy regime , by reversing the direction of pm in the right pf .",
    "this suggests a pseudospin switching effect between the pure ct and pure car in pf / s / pf structure , which can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ pseudospin_pf / s / pf ] ) , for the right going conduction ( valance)band electron ( hole ) of @xmath1- ( @xmath2-)doped pf , @xmath163    ( color online ) plots of the conductance for ct and car processes , respectively , in parallel ( @xmath164 ) and antiparallel ( @xmath165 ) alignments of pms versus the length of the s region for two values of @xmath166 , when @xmath167 and @xmath168.,width=326 ]    figure [ fig:10 ] shows the behavior of the conductance of ct and car processes , respectively , in parallel and antiparallel alignments of pms versus the length of the s region for two values of @xmath136 , when @xmath169 and @xmath168 .",
    "it is seen that the ct process is favored for short junctions @xmath170 , while the car process is suppressed in this regime .",
    "the ct conductance drops by increasing the length @xmath50 , while the car conductance peaks at @xmath171 .",
    "we see that the conductance of ct and car processes have oscillatory behavior with @xmath172 and increase by increasing @xmath136 from their values for the corresponding graphene",
    "n / s / n structure .",
    "also we can see that in contrast to the graphene n / s / n structure , ct and car processes are present for long lengths of the s region , respectively , in parallel and antiparallel pm configurations .",
    "this effect is similar to graphene f / s / f structure @xcite and shows that the gapped normal graphene behaves like an f graphene .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated the unusual features of the pseudospin polarized quantum transport in graphene - based hybrid structures of normal ( n ) regions , superconductors ( s ) and gapped regions as pseudoferromagnets ( pfs ) .",
    "a gapped graphene is in a sublattice pseudospin symmetry - broken state with a net pseudomagnetization ( pm ) oriented perpendicularly to the plane of graphene .",
    "the magnitude of pm depends on the ratio of the chemical potential to the energy gap @xmath43 and its direction is switched by changing the type of doping between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "based on this observation , we have proposed a perfect pseudospin valve ( pf / n / pf junction ) with pseudomagnetoresistance @xmath67 , for @xmath37 and appropriate contact length @xmath50 , whose magnetization alignments can be controlled by altering the type of their doping .",
    "we have shown that this perfect pseudomagnetic valve effect is preserved even for very large lengths @xmath173 .",
    "also , it can be resumed at large chemical potentials by applying an appropriate bias voltage .",
    "we have explained this strong robustness of the perfect pseudomagnetic switching with respect to increasing of the contact length , in terms of an unusually long - range penetration of an equilibrium and nonequilibrium pseudospin polarization into the normal region by proximity to a pf .",
    "the induced pseudomagnetization vector @xmath35 undergoes a damped spatial precession around the normal to the pf / n junction and tends to be uniform along the normal at the large distances @xmath174 from the junction .",
    "furthermore , we have found that upon a certain condition , andreev reflection ( ar ) of an electron from an s / pf interface is associated with an inversion of the perpendicular component of its pseudospin , and that this has important consequences for the proximity effect in s / pf and pf / s / pf geometries .",
    "for an s / pf junction system , we have found that the andreev - klein reflection can enhance the amplitude of ar and the resulting andreev conductance by @xmath11 . in particular , we have shown that depending on the bias voltage the andreev conductance of weekly doped pf ( @xmath175 ) can be larger than its value for the corresponding graphene s / n junction .",
    "this is similar to the behavior of andreev conductance with the exchange energy @xmath3 in a graphene ferromagnet - superconductor junction .",
    "we have further studied the proximity density of states ( dos ) in pseudoferromagnetic side of the s / pf contact , which exhibit a damped - oscillatory behavior as a function of the distance from the interface .",
    "the period of dos oscillations is found to be inversely proportional to the energy gap @xmath11 .",
    "the proximity dos in ferromagnetic graphene shows similar spatial oscillations with a period determined by @xmath176 . for a superconducting pseudospin valve ( pf / s / pf ) structure , we have found that the transport is mediated purely by elastic electron cotunneling process in parallel alignment of pms and crossed andreev reflection process in antiparallel configuration , that is accompanied by pseudospin switching effect",
    "this is again similar to the behavior of the corresponding superconducting structure with ferromagnetic graphene and confirms that , in this respect , the effect of the sublattice pseudospin degree of freedom in gapped graphene is as important as the spin in a ferromagnetic graphene .",
