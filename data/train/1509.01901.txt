    "clusters of galaxies grow through mergers with other ( sub-)clusters and by accreting material from the surrounding large - scale structure filaments .",
    "major mergers between systems of comparable masses release tremendous amounts of energy into the intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "these events drive shocks and turbulence in the icm , thereby heating the thermal diffuse gas , accelerating particles to relativistic energies , and amplifying the intra - cluster magnetic fields ( see reviews by e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "evidence for these mergers can be readily identified at a variety of wavelengths . in the hot , diffuse icm ,",
    "merger shocks create discontinuities in the temperature , density and pressure profiles that can be measured through x - ray observations .",
    "more recently , shocks have also been detected using the sunyaev zeldovich ( sz ) effect , whose strength is directly proportional to the thermal pressure of the x - ray emitting plasma ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , particles accelerated to relativistic energies during the mergers emit synchrotron radiation in the radio band . depending mainly on their morphology and location with respect to the x - ray peak",
    ", radio features in galaxy clusters are categorised either as radio haloes or relics ( @xcite ) .",
    "radio haloes are relatively symmetric , usually unpolarised , and cover the central parts of galaxy clusters , on scales of typically 1 - 2 mpc .",
    "there are two main hypotheses to explain their origin : ( re)acceleration of electrons up to relativistic energies due to the turbulence induced by cluster mergers ( e.g. @xcite ) , or collisions between thermal ions and relativistic protons in the icm ( @xcite ) .",
    "radio relics are typically elongated in the tangential direction and located near the clusters periphery . their origin is thought to be connected to particle acceleration at shock fronts driven by the merger ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "multi - wavelength studies of the thermal and non - thermal contents of clusters of galaxies using x - ray , sz , and radio data can therefore reveal important information regarding the mechanisms through which particles are accelerated ( and the icm is heated ) during major cluster mergers .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : obssum ]    as one of the nearest , brightest , most massive merging systems , the coma cluster has been the target of a wealth of observations covering a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum . the cluster is known to host both a giant radio halo ( coma c ) and a radio relic towards the south - west ( @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray observations have revealed the presence of a shock front associated with the radio relic ( @xcite ) . the giant radio halo exhibits a relatively sharp edge observed at 352 mhz with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt , @xcite ) .    using sz observations of the coma cluster , @xcite indicated the existence of pressure jumps toward the south - west and south - east of the coma cluster centre , whose positions coincide with the edge of the wsrt giant radio halo .",

    "the value of this constant was estimated from the same suzaku pointings that were used to determine the x - ray background model used for spectral analysis ( these background fields are located beyond the 70 arcmin , the cluster s estimated @xmath6 ) .",
    "we include the effects of suzaku s point spread function ( psf ) by convolving the surface brightness model with a gaussian with a full width at half maximum of 1.9 arcmin .",
    "we first fitted the radial surface brightness profiles centred on the cluster centre , restricting our fit to the radial range between 26 and 45 arcmin .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ sbprof_a ] .",
    "the best fit parameters are @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 arcmin and @xmath96 . accordingly , the corresponding mach number from the rankine - hugoniot condition for the density jump is @xmath97 .    for fitting the surface brightness profiles centred on the `` analysis centre ''",

    "the density discontinuity is stronger and more easily seen , and the computed best fit parameters are @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 arcmin and @xmath101 , resulting in the mach number @xmath102 .",
    "as can be seen in the right - hand panel of figure [ sbprof_a ] , the location of the edge in the x - ray surface brightness profile computed with respect to the `` analysis centre '' corresponds well to the location of the radio halo s edge .",
    "we have also searched for spatial variations of the mach number by calculating surface brightness profiles centred on the `` analysis centre '' in two separate wedges with equal opening angles .",
    "we find no evidence for significant differences in the shock strength , with @xmath103 arcmin and @xmath104 for the northern half and @xmath105 arcmin and @xmath106 for the southern half of the shock covered by suzaku .",
    "we have analysed data from four suzaku pointings located along the western side of the coma cluster .",
    "both the temperature and surface brightness distributions reveal the presence of a shock front likely associated with the edge of the coma radio halo . in this section , we investigate the strength and location of the shock , in comparison with previous results estimated from x - ray , sz , and radio observations , and discuss particle acceleration at x - ray shocks in relation to the origin of the radio emission .",
    "previous x - ray studies have already revealed the presence of temperature structure in the coma cluster .",
    "asca observations ( @xcite ) showed a temperature asymmetry , with the western side of the cluster being hotter than the eastern side .",
    "this trend was later confirmed by xmm - newton and suzaku ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this temperature structure is thought to be associated with a past merger ( @xcite ) .",
    "using sz observations , @xcite report the presence of two shock fronts located about 30 arcmin towards the west and south - east from the cluster centre , with mach numbers @xmath107 and @xmath108 derived from the rankine - hugoniot pressure jump conditions . both of the shocks reported by @xcite align well with the sharp gradients in the 352 mhz wsrt radio brightness distribution , and",
    "are associated with x - ray surface brightness edges and temperature jumps detected in xmm - newton data .",
    "thus , shock heating is likely at least partly responsible for the elevated gas temperatures on the western side of the cluster reported by previous studies .    in this work",
    ", we also report the presence of a shock front along the western side of the coma cluster , although located further north than the western shock reported by @xcite ; the area corresponding to the shock seen by planck is not covered by suzaku observations . for different choices of extraction regions and different assumptions about the underlying temperature profile in the absence of shock heating ,",
    "the temperature profiles measured with suzaku imply mach numbers ranging from @xmath83 to @xmath73 , broadly consistent with the mach number derived from sz observations for what can be assumed to be a different azimuth along the same shock front that traces the entire western edge of the giant radio halo .",
    "shock signatures are seen not only in the temperature but also in the x - ray surface brightness distribution along this azimuth .",
    "when extracting radial profiles in annuli roughly parallel to the steep radio edge , we obtain consistent mach numbers from the inferred temperature and surface brightness jumps , with @xmath83 and @xmath102 , respectively . however , when choosing annuli centred on the peak x - ray emission of the coma cluster , the shock strengths derived from the temperature and surface brightness become inconsistent , with the mach number inferred from the temperature jump , @xmath73 , being larger than that determined from the density jump , @xmath97 . even when accounting for the expected underlying radial temperature gradient between the pre- and post - shock regions in a typical relaxed cluster , the mach number inferred from the temperature jump remains high , at @xmath109 .",
    "it is generally expected that a mis - alignment of the shock front compared to the orientation of the spectral extraction regions would lead to an underestimation of both the true temperature as well as density jumps .",
    "therefore , the observed decrease of the mach number estimated from the surface brightness profile , from @xmath110 to @xmath111 for a less optimised geometry , is easily understood ; however , assuming the shock has a spherically symmetrical shape , it is difficult to explain why the shock strength inferred from the temperature jump does not show a commensurate decrement .    perhaps even more surprisingly , the locations of the discontinuities determined from the x - ray temperature and surface brightness differ .",
    "when considering the profiles centred around the `` analysis centre '' , we obtain @xmath100 arcmin from the surface brightness profile fitting ; this is in good agreement with the location of the radio halo edge ( the `` analysis centre '' was chosen so that a circle of radius 40 arcmin centred on this point traces most closely the western 352 mhz wsrt radio contours ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the temperature jump is seen at a radius of 45 arcmin ; a quick inspection of figure [ kt_b ] reveals that , for a shock located at a radius of 40.5 arcmin , we expect to detect a temperature jump between the second and third annuli ( 3540 and 4045 arcmin ) , rather than between the third and fourth annuli as currently seen .",
    "a similar conclusion is reached for profiles centred around the cluster centre . in this case , the surface brightness jump is seen at @xmath112 arcmin , in good agreement with the location of the radio edge contours spanning 3435 arcmin with respect to this choice of centre , while the temperature jump is seen at 40 arcmin .    thus , the locations of the temperature and density jumps appear to differ by 4.56.6 arcmin ( 125185  kpc ) , with the temperature jump located further out while the surface brightness jump agrees well with the position of the edge of the radio halo .",
    "this difference is significantly larger than the suzaku psf , and is seen regardless of the choice of the centre used to extract the profiles . if the locations of the temperature and density jumps are better aligned for the southwestern half of the region characterised by a steep radio gradient , this would explain why the northwestern shock has not been previously identified either by @xcite ( the pressure jump is smeared because the product of temperature and density now has discontinuities at multiple radii ) , or by @xcite who showed that xmm - newton spectra from smaller extraction regions on either side of the radio edge only suggest a significant temperature jump towards the southwest but not towards the northwest .",
    "a possible explanation for the different shock radii inferred from the temperature and surface brightness profiles is that the shocked gas that covers the largest line of sight depth ( and has contributed to accelerating the most radio - emitting particles ) has been heated by a weaker shock and lies closer to the centre , while the temperature jump is driven by gas affected by a stronger shock at slightly larger radii , but where the shock has a smaller line of sight depth ; while this might still steepen the power - law fitted to the surface brightness distribution , the line - of - sight effect may conceal an actual discontinuity corresponding to the location of the temperature jump .",
    "we note that numerical simulations do indeed suggest both complex shapes as well as complex distributions of the mach number along the shock fronts believed to be responsible for accelerating particles to the relativistic energies required to produce radio emission in radio relics ( @xcite ) , so it is plausible that this may also apply for the coma radio halo .",
    "an alternative , perhaps more exotic scenario , is that in which a fraction of the particles accelerated by the shock may diffuse ahead of the shock and cool out of the radio band by mixing with and heating the thermal icm .",
    "the two main hypotheses typically invoked in the past in order to explain the synchrotron emission in radio haloes are typically ( re)acceleration of electrons up to relativistic energies due to the turbulence induced by cluster mergers ( e.g. @xcite ) , or collisions between thermal ions and relativistic protons in the icm ( @xcite ) .",
    "concomitantly , in a growing body of publications , the edges of radio haloes are found to be coincident with shock fronts ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite , and this work ) .",
    "this suggests that shocks are an additional process contributing to the acceleration of particles in radio haloes .",
    "the clusters where shocks are seen to be associated with the edges of radio haloes therefore present a unique angle to study a superposition of particle acceleration mechanisms acting simultaneously .",
    "the coma cluster is the nearest , brightest , and to date one of the best studied among this type of systems .",
    "one of the main theoretical challenges to be addressed in this case is the exact mechanism through which very weak shocks ( @xmath113 in coma and typically @xmath114 in other clusters cited above ) are in fact able to boost the radio surface brightness . for such low mach numbers , the diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) mechanism alone is thought to be inefficient at accelerating particles .",
    "the preferred interpretation is that , instead of directly accelerating the thermal electrons , the shocks re - accelerate a population of already mildly relativistic electrons present in the cluster ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the morphology of the coma radio halo supports this interpretation ; the observed steepening , or `` edge '' , in the radio surface brightness profiles reported by @xcite , is sharpest along the western side of the cluster , and is not apparent along most other directions .",
    "suzaku demonstrates for the first time that a shock front extends not only along the southern but also along the northern half of this radio brightness edge .",
    "therefore , we can infer that the difference in radio brightness between the western side of the cluster and other azimuths is entirely attributed to reacceleration due to the shock passage .",
    "recent particle - in - cell simulations indicate that a different mechanism termed shock drift acceleration may result in a more efficient acceleration at low - mach number shocks compared to standard dsa ( e.g. @xcite ) , further boosting the radio surface brightness at the western coma shock .",

    "<S> we present the results of new suzaku observations of the coma cluster , the x - ray brightest , nearby , merging system hosting a well studied , typical giant radio halo . </S>",
    "<S> it has been previously shown that , on the western side of the cluster , the radio brightness shows a much steeper gradient compared to other azimuths . </S>",
    "<S> xmm - newton and planck revealed a shock front along the southern half of the region associated with this steep radio gradient , suggesting that the radio emission is enhanced by particle acceleration associated with the shock passage . </S>",
    "<S> suzaku demonstrates for the first time that this shock front extends northwards , tracing the entire length of the western edge of the coma radio halo . </S>",
    "<S> the shock is detected both in the temperature and x - ray surface brightness distributions and has a mach number of around @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the locations of the surface brightness edges align well with the edge of the radio emission , while the obtained temperature profiles seem to suggest shocks located 125185 kpc further out in radius . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the shock strengths derived from the temperature and density jumps are in agreement when using extraction regions parallel to the radio halo edge , but become inconsistent with each other when derived from radial profiles centred on the coma cluster core . </S>",
    "<S> it is likely that , beyond mere projection effects , the geometry of the shock is more complex than a front with a single , uniform mach number and an approximately spherically symmetric shape . </S>"
