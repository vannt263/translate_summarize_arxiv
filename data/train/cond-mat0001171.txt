    "during the past several years low dimensional quantum spin systems such as the spin - peierls , spin - ladder and an antiferromagnetic heisenberg linear chain systems have attracted much attention @xcite .",
    "the vanadate family of av@xmath0o@xmath1 oxides ( a = li , na , cs , mg and ca ) , which have common v@xmath2o@xmath1 square pyramids in the structure , have demonstrated a variety of the low dimensional quantum spin phenomena : charge - ordering transition in nav@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite , spin - gap behavior in ca(mg)v@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite and csv@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite and typical 1-d behavior without spin gap in liv@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility data , fitted in the framework of the bonner - fisher model with the exchange interaction j=308 k @xcite , suggest that the magnetic properties of this system can be described using homogenous heisenberg antiferromagnetic linear chain model . the nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr )",
    "measurements showed the formation of the staggered spin configurations due to the existence of the finite - size effect@xcite .",
    "however , in spite of good understanding of the magnetic properties , the study of the vibrational properties of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 is of a great importance because of the still puzzling interplay between the charge and the magnetic ordering in nav@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "thus , in this work we present the polarized far - infrared ( fir ) reflectivity as well as the raman scattering spectra of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 single crystals .",
    "the 16@xmath3 , 7@xmath4 , 6@xmath5 , 9@xmath6 , and 5@xmath7 symmetry modes are experimentally observed .",
    "the assignment of the vibrational modes is done by comparing the phonons in liv@xmath0o@xmath1 and nav@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , our spectra demonstrate the dominance of the layer symmetry in liv@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the present work was performed on single crystal plates with dimensions typically about @xmath8 mm@xmath9 in the * a * , * b * , and * c * axes , respectively .",
    "the details of sample preparation were published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the infrared measurements were carried out with a bomem da-8 fir spectrometer .",
    "a dtgs pyroelectric detector was used to cover the wave number region from 100 to 700 @xmath10 ; a liquid nitrogen cooled hgcdte detector was used from 500 to 1500 @xmath10 .",
    "spectra were collected with 2 @xmath10 resolution , with 1000 interferometer scans added for each spectrum .",
    "the raman spectra were measured in the backscattering configuration using micro - raman system with dilor triple monochromator including liquid nitrogen cooled ccd - detector .",
    "an ar - ion laser was used as an excitation source .",
    "liv@xmath0o@xmath1 has an orthorhombic unit cell @xcite with parameters a=0.9702 nm , b=0.3607 nm , c= 1.0664 nm , z=4 and space group pnma ( d@xmath11 ) . each vanadium atom is surrounded by five oxygen atoms , forming v@xmath12 pyramids .",
    "these pyramids are mutually connected via common edges to form zigzag chains along the * b*-direction .",
    "such a crystalline structure is characterized by two kinds of vanadium double chains along the * b*-axis .",
    "one is magnetic v@xmath2 ( s=1/2 ) and the other one is nonmagnetic v@xmath13 ( s=0 ) chain .",
    "these chains are linked by corner sharing to form layers in ( 001 ) - plane , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) .",
    "the li atoms are situated between these layers , as shown in fig .",

    "the factor - group - analysis ( fga ) yields @xcite :        summarizing these representations and subtracting the acoustic ( @xmath20 + @xmath7 + @xmath6 ) and silent ( 8@xmath19 ) modes , we obtained the following irreducible representations of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 vibrational modes of pnma space group :      thus , 48 raman and 37 infrared active modes are expected to show up in the liv@xmath0o@xmath1 spectra .",
    "the room temperature polarized far - infrared reflectivity spectra of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 are given in fig .",
    "the open circles are the experimental data and the solid lines represent the spectra computed using a four - parameter model for the dielectric constant @xcite .      where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are longitudinal and transverse frequencies of the j@xmath26 oscillator , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are their corresponding dampings , and @xmath29 is the high - frequency dielectric constant .",
    "the static dielectric constant , given in table i , is obtained using the generalized lyddane - sachs - teller relation @xmath30 .",
    "the best - oscillator - fit parameters are listed in table i. the agreement between observed and calculated reflectivity spectra is rather good . for the * e*@xmath22*a * polarization , nine oscillators with to frequencies at about 202 , 243 , 255 , 340 , 397 , 545 , 724 , 948 ,",

    "we failed to obtain usefull signal for * e*@xmath22*c * spectra because of the very small thickness ( * c*-axis ) of the sample .",
    "the room and the low temperature raman spectra of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 , for parallel and crossed polarizations , are given in fig .",
    "the spectra for parallel polarizations consist of @xmath3 symmetry modes .",

    "@xmath10 are found . in the case of the ( bc ) polarization ,",
    "six @xmath5 symmetry modes were observed with almost the same frequencies as @xmath4 modes .",
    "the raman spectra for ( ac ) polarization is given in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( f ) . for this polarization ( @xmath21 symmetry )",
    "we could not resolve any new mode .",
    "namely , all modes observed for this polarization have been already seen in parallel or in other crossed polarizations , probably because of low - quality of the ( 010 ) surface .",
    "the frequencies of all observed raman active modes are given in table ii .",
    "we will first consider the raman spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . from the 16 @xmath3 , 8@xmath4 , 8@xmath5 and 16@xmath21 modes predicted by fga of liv@xmath0o@xmath1",
    ", we clearly observe 16@xmath3 , 7@xmath4 , and 6@xmath5 modes .",
    "the missing modes seam to be of a very weak intensity .",
    "the ( ac ) polarized spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( f ) ) consist mostly of @xmath3 modes ( and some @xmath4 ) .",
    "the appearance of @xmath4 and @xmath5 symmetry modes at the same frequencies lead us to consider the crystal structure of this oxide once again .",
    "the liv@xmath0o@xmath1 crystal is a layer crystal ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) ) .",
    "the vibrational properties of such crystals demonstrate the dominance of the layer symmetry @xcite .",
    "the unit cell of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 consists of two layers with 16 atoms in all .",
    "the full symbol of space group is p 2@xmath15/n 2@xmath15/m 2@xmath15/a .",
    "the first symbol represents @xmath31-screw axis along * a*-axis followed by diagonal glide plane ( n ) perpendicular to * a*- axis with translation ( b+c)/2 ; the second symbol is the @xmath31 -screw axis parallel to * b*-axis with mirror plane perpendicular to it and third symbol means @xmath31-screw axis parallel to * c*-axis with glide plane perpendicular to * c*-axis with translation of a/2 ( see the lower part of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . if we consider only one layer we break the periodicity in the direction perpendicular to the layer . as a consequence ,",
    "there are no more symmetry operations along the * a*- and * c*-axes .",
    "now we should consider the layer symmetry in terms of diperiodic groups @xcite rather than triperiodic space groups .",
    "we found four operation of layer symmetry , fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] :            the dg15 diperiodic group is the only symmetry operation group of 80 that has these symmetry operations . the full symbol of this diperiodic group is p 1 @xmath31/m 1 .",
    "this group is isomorphic with the c@xmath33 ( p@xmath31/m ) space group ( second setting ) @xcite .",
    "all atoms are in symmetry position ( e ) of this space group ( with c@xmath14 point symmetry ) .",
    "the normal mode distribution for the layer is      the compatibility diagram , relating the layer and the crystal vibration of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 , together with the schematic representation of the layer and the crystal symmetry operations as well as the experimental conditions for the observation of the optical modes , are given in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . according to fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the @xmath3 modes for the layer symmetry appear for parallel and for ( ac ) crossed polarization and the @xmath4 and @xmath5 modes of crystal symmetry merge into @xmath34 modes of the layer symmetry .",
    "these facts are fully in agreement with our raman spectra , fig .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the vibrational properties of crystal are predominantly due to vibrational properties of the layer .",
    "as we already mentioned , the size of samples in ( 010 ) plane and worse quality of this surface do not allow us to check this conclusion also by infrared spectroscopy .    by comparing the liv@xmath0o@xmath1 spectra with the corresponding spectra and the lattice dynamics of nav@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite we analyze the liv@xmath0o@xmath1 phonon properties .",
    "the basic building blocks of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 crystal structure are vo@xmath1 pyramids which are mutually connected by edge to build the chains .",
    "such chains are also present in nav@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the difference between crystal structures of na- and li- vanadate is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . in nav@xmath0o@xmath1",
    "there is only one vanadium site while in liv@xmath0o@xmath1 two nonequivalent vanadium atom positions are present . besides that",
    ", the v@xmath15-o - v@xmath0 angle in liv@xmath0o@xmath1 is smaller ( 120@xmath36 ) than in nav@xmath0o@xmath1 ( 140@xmath36 ) .",
    "distance between atoms in vo@xmath1 pyramids does not differ significantly in li- and na- vanadates .",
    "this produces only a small frequency shift of the corresponding modes in these compounds .",
    "the existence of the two different vo@xmath1 chains with nearly the same inter - atomic distance can produce the appearance of mode doublets .",
    "raman spectra for ( aa ) and ( bb ) polarizations of both compounds are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . as it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , each mode of nav@xmath0o@xmath1 in the bond stretching region ( above 450 @xmath10 ) appears as a doublet in liv@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the highest intensity mode in nav@xmath0o@xmath1 originates from v - o@xmath15 bond stretching vibration . the distance between these atoms in na - vanadate is 1.62 @xmath37 . in li vanadate",
    "there are two such bonds , one longer bond 1.65 @xmath37 ( v@xmath15-o@xmath16 ) and one slightly shorter 1.61 @xmath37 ( v@xmath0-o@xmath0 ) than v - o@xmath15 bond in na - vanadate .",
    "thus , we can expect the appearance of two modes with frequencies higher and lower than the na v - o@xmath15 bond stretching frequency .",
    "in fact , two modes are observed in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] at lower and higher frequency than na v - o@xmath15 mode .",
    "applying the same analysis to the another doublet in bond stretching energy region we conclude that 528/550 @xmath10 modes originate from v@xmath15-o@xmath17 ( v@xmath0-o@xmath1 ) bond stretching vibration .",
    "this doublet corresponds to the mode at 534 @xmath10 of nav@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "similar non - phononic broad structure , observed in na - vanadate for ( aa ) polarization at about 640 @xmath10 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) , is found in liv@xmath0o@xmath1 as a doublet at about 639/725 @xmath10 .",
    "there are several scenarios to explain this structure @xcite .",
    "first , electric dipole transitions between split crystal field levels , second two - magnon scattering , and third possible electron - phonon coupled modes observed in antiferromagnets . in the case of",
    "nav@xmath0o@xmath1 the wide structure shifts to lower energy upon cooling @xcite .",
    "et al._@xcite concluded that such kind of behavior comes from electron - phonon coupling like in antiferromagnetic fecl@xmath38@xcite .",
    "the opposite frequency shift vs. temperature of wide structure maximum in nav@xmath0o@xmath1 then in fecl@xmath0 is connected with the strong spin fluctuations in low dimensions @xcite .",
    "two - magnon excitations lead to broad band structures in raman scattering spectra .",
    "the very recent neutron scattering measurements @xcite of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 show antiferromagnetic periodicity along the b - axis ( chain direction ) .",
    "these results suggests that liv@xmath0o@xmath1 can be regarded as a collection of independent s=1/2 af linear chains with zone boundary energy of @xmath39 mev .",
    "the frequencies of observed modes ( 640/725 @xmath10 ) are comparable with the values of exchange coupling energy j=308 k ( 3j=640 @xmath10 ) and zone boundary energy range ( 2e@xmath40= 628 - 724 @xmath10 ) , respectively .",
    "however , the polarization selection rules allow the appearance of modes for polarization of incident and scattered light parallel to the dominant exchange path ( b - axis direction ) . because we observed broad modes only for ( aa ) and ( cc ) polarization and there is no frequency shift of these modes to higher energies by lowering of the temperature we concluded that two - magnon scenario is not realistic .",
    "finally , we consider the appearance of these modes as crystal field induced @xcite .",
    "these transitions between different crystal field levels should be discrete , and no significant frequency shift vs. temperature can be expected .",
    "this is in accordance with our spectra given in fig.3 .",
    "the appearance of two peaks can be understood due to existence of two structurally different strongly deformed vo@xmath1 pyramids .",
    "the modes at frequencies below 450 @xmath10 originate from bond bending vibrations . in the na - vanadate",
    "the v - o@xmath16-v bending mode appears at 448 @xmath10 .",
    "the corresponding mode in li - vanadate could be the one at 374 @xmath10 .",
    "note that , the frequency of this mode is about 16 % lower than in na - vanadate , as a consequence of the change of the bond - bending force constant .",
    "we make an approximate estimation for the change of the bond - bending force constant by scaling the frequency as the square root of the force constant , and assuming a scaling of the force constants as r@xmath41 ( r is the bond length ) @xcite .",
    "similarly , scaling of the phonon frequency for the bond stretching mode is r@xmath42 . in our case the r ( o - v - o)@xmath43/r(o - v - o)@xmath44 is 0.98 .",
    "this parameter can produce the decrease of the phonon frequency of only 5 % .",
    "the remaining part of frequency decrease probably comes from modification of bond - bending force constant due to redistribution of the electron density @xcite .",
    "namely , according to refs.@xcite the electrons in nav@xmath0o@xmath1 are located in a v - o@xmath16-v molecular orbital .",
    "this is not the case in liv@xmath0o@xmath1 where the electrons are located in v@xmath2 chains .",
    "the highest intensity mode for ( bb ) polarization in li sample is the mode at 328 @xmath10 .",
    "this mode originates from o - v - o bending vibrations as the highest intensity ( bb ) polarized mode in na - sample .",
    "the broad structure at about 398 @xmath10 seems to correspond to li vibration .",
    "if we consider mass effect only , the replacement of heavier na atoms with lighter li produces the shift of corresponding mode towards higher frequency according to ( @xmath45=179 @xmath10 ) x ( m@xmath43/m@xmath44)@xmath46 = 326 @xmath10 , which is not to far from the observed mode . besides , the li - o vibrations are expected @xcite at about 390 @xmath10 .",
    "the pair of modes at 172/209 @xmath10 originates from o - v - o bending vibration , and the pair of lowest frequency modes at 100/123 @xmath10 represents chain rotation modes .",
    "the similar analysis could be conducted for b@xmath47 modes .",
    "namely , the modes at 646 and 737 @xmath10 are v@xmath15-o@xmath17 and v@xmath0-o@xmath1 bond stretching vibrations ; the three modes at 250 , 270 and 333 @xmath10 are bond bending vibrations , and the lowest frequency mode at 168 @xmath10 represents chain rotation mode .",
    "we should mention that similar mode exists in nav@xmath0o@xmath1 for crossed polarization too .      in conclusion",
    ", we have measured the infrared and raman spectra of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the assignment of the phonons is done by comparing the infrared and raman spectra of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 and nav@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the factor - group - analysis of the liv@xmath0o@xmath1 crystal symmetry and of its constituent layers is performed to explain the symmetry properties of the observed modes .",
