    "generation of well - controlled quantum correlations is the main research of many scientists working in the relatively new field of quantum information and quantum processing @xcite .",

    "pairs of semiconductor quantum dots ( sqds ) where each one is characterized by two - level states ( ground state and excitonic excited state ) are ideal experimentally realistic nanostructures . moreover , by introducing a plasmonic nanostructure between the two sqds , the local electromagnetic field can be altered in a somehow desirable way and strong quantum correlations can be obtained @xcite .    in the above area of studies , artuso and",
    "bryant @xcite studied a system composed by two sqds ( modeled as two - level systems ) mediated by a spherical metal nanoparticle ( mnp ) .",
    "they gave emphasis to the interaction of the system with an external electromagnetic field and presented the population dynamics of the two - qubit system for several cases .",
    "previously , he and zhu @xcite had studied the transient population dynamics and the entanglement dynamics of the same system in the absence of an external electronagnetic field . also , quite recently , nerkararyan and bozhevolnyi @xcite have investigated how the relaxation dynamics in a system of two quantum dipole emitters ( modeled as three - level systems ) coupled to a spherical mnp influences the entanglement dynamics .",
    "the externally - driven coupled sqd - spherical mnp - sqd system @xcite is a direct extension of the externally - driven coupled sqd - spherical mnp system , which is a basic system of quantum plasmonics @xcite . in the externally - driven coupled sqd - spherical mnp system ,",
    "the optical properties and the controlled population dynamics has been extensively studied @xcite . in this work",
    ", we return to the externally - driven coupled sqd - spherical mnp - sqd system @xcite and study in detail the entanglement between the two sqds .",
    "we quantify the entanglement with the eof and present results for both transient entanglement dynamics and the steady state value of entanglement for various system parameters .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 , we present the theoretical model for the hybrid nanostructure in the presence of an applied external electromagnetic field and introduce a semi - classical scheme to describe the coupling of the pair of qubits and the applied field . next , in sect .",
    "3 we present the results for the time evolution of eof and steady state results for eof as a function of the various characteristic parameters of the hybrid system . finally , in sect .",
    "4 we summarize our findings .",
    "we consider a hybrid nanomolecule composed of two identical sqds interacting with a spherical mnp by the center - to - center distances @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "the entire system is subject to a continuous wave ( cw ) applied electric field @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the magnitude of the driving field and @xmath4 is its angular frequency .",
    "we model the sqds as effective quantum two - level systems with exciton energies @xmath5 and @xmath6 , transition electric dipole moments @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and dielectric constants @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we treat the mnp as a classical spherical dielectric particle with dielectric function @xmath11 , and imagine the entire system to be embedded in a material of dielectric constant @xmath12 .",
    "each quantum dot has three interactions .",
    "the first is the direct coupling to the applied field .",
    "second , each sqd interacts with the electric field produced by the mnp .",
    "last , the sqds interact with each other @xcite .",
    "similarly the mnp responds to the applied field , as well as to each sqd .",
    "we begin by writing the hamiltonian for the two sqds , @xmath13 , as @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the exciton annihilation and creation operators for sqd1(2 ) and @xmath17 represents the direct coupling between the two quantum dots . also , @xmath18 is the electric field at the center of sqd1 , that consists of the applied , external field @xmath19 and the induced field produced by the polarization of the mnp @xmath20 .",
    "thus , @xmath18 is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the screening factor of sqd1 .",
    "the field on sqd1 from the mnp is @xmath23 where @xmath24 when the applied field is parallel ( perpendicular ) to the major axis of the system .",
    "( @xmath25 is calculated similarly ) . in the dipole limit , the polarization of the mnp is @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the positive and negative frequency parts of the field felt by the mnp .",
    "the total field acting on the mnp , @xmath29 , is just @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "we use of the density matrix @xmath32 to calculate the polarization of the sqds .",
    "we take as our states @xmath33 and @xmath34 , ( where , for example , @xmath35 is the state with sqd1 excited and sqd2 in its ground state ) .",
    "we then have @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "this allows us to write @xmath18 , but we still need an expression for @xmath17 to complete our calculation of @xmath13 .",
    "we treat the field produced by the sqd1 as a classical electric field , produced by a dipole with polarization @xmath38 ( similarly for sqd2 ) .",
    "then , we have @xcite @xmath39 in taking this approach we are assuming that we can replace a quantized field produced by the exciton , with a mean field value computed by the density matrix .",
    "this is a semiclassical approximation .",
    "we model the system using the semiclassical approximation for the sqd - sqd coupling .",
    "the hamiltonian becomes @xcite @xmath40(\\hat{\\alpha}_1^{\\dagger}+\\hat{\\alpha}_1)\\\\ & & -\\hbar[\\omega_2e^{-i \\omega t}+g_2(\\tilde{\\rho}_{31}+\\tilde{\\rho}_{42})e^{-i \\omega t}+f(\\tilde{\\rho}_{21}+\\tilde{\\rho}_{43})e^{-i \\omega t}\\\\ & & \\omega_2^{*}e^{i \\omega t}+g_2^{*}(\\tilde{\\rho}_{13}+\\tilde{\\rho}_{24})e^{i \\omega t}+f^{*}(\\tilde{\\rho}_{12}+\\tilde{\\rho}_{34})e^{i \\omega t}](\\hat{\\alpha}_2+\\hat{\\alpha}_2^{\\dagger})\\\\ & & -dip(\\rho_{13}+\\rho_{31}+\\rho_{24}+\\rho_{42})(\\hat{\\alpha}_1+\\hat{\\alpha}_1^{\\dagger})\\\\ & & -dip(\\rho_{12}+\\rho_{21}+\\rho_{34}+\\rho_{43})(\\hat{\\alpha}_2^{\\dagger}+\\hat{\\alpha}_2 ) \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined , @xmath41 here , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are defined similarly to @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath44 arises when the applied fields polarizes sqd1 , which polarizes the mnp and produces a field to interact back on sqd1 .",
    "thus , this can be thought of as the self - interaction of sqd1 because this coupling to sqd1 depends on the polarization of sqd1 .",
    "the first term in @xmath45 is just the direct coupling to the applied field and the second term is the field from the mnp that is induced by the applied field .",
    "@xmath46 and @xmath47 arise from the interaction of the two dots .",

    "we assume that the same @xmath49 applies if the two dots interact and @xmath32 is no longer separable .",
    "finally , we present the measure of quantum correlations which is used in this work , i.e. the eof . in order to find the eof @xcite we compute the matrix @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the solution of the previous master equation and @xmath64 , with @xmath65 are the pauli matrices of the two sqds respectively . by diagonalising the matrix @xmath66 ,",

    "the eof takes values from 0 ( no entanglement for the system ) to 1 ( maximum entanglement ) .",
    "we take the electric field @xmath19 parallel to the axis of our sqd - mnp - sqd hybrid molecule , i.e , @xmath73 , and take the dielectric constant of the background to be @xmath74 . for the mnp , we take @xmath75 as the bulk dielectric constant of gold as found experimentally @xcite . for a small , spherical , gold mnp",
    ", the response has a broad plasmon peak , near 2.4 ev with a width of approximately 0.25 ev .",
    "we let the radius of the mnp vary between 3 and 8 nm .",
    "for the sqds we take @xmath76 and for the exciton resonance frequency we take it to be 2.5 ev , which is near the broad , plasmon frequency of gold . for the mnp size regime , we consider , the plasmon resonance for a sphere , varies little with particle size .",
    "however , the size , shape , and material of the sqd strongly determine both the exciton energy level and its dipole moment . in this paper",
    ", we consider the simplest model and ignore this size dependence .",
    "while this is an oversimplification , it allows us to identify the range of optical signatures in the strong field limit . for the dipole moments of the sqds , we let them vary between 0.25 and 4.0 e nm @xcite .",
    "also , we take @xmath77 ns and @xmath78 ns .",
    "in order to calculate the quantum correlations , we solve the set of differential equations of the density matrix elements of eq .",

    "our basis is composed of four states , named @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , where @xmath83 and @xmath84 label the ground and the excited states of the @xmath85-qubit , respectively . in the present",
    "study our initial state is the most natural one , @xmath86 , where both qubits are in the ground state . a cw external laser field",
    "is applied to the system .",
    "the intensity of the applied laser field is proportional to the square magnitude of @xmath87 .",
    "significant values of eof ( i.e larger than 0.1 ) are found for intensities larger than 10 w/@xmath88 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : eoftime ] we plot the time evolution of eof for representative values of the geometric parameters of the hybrid system ( @xmath89 nm , @xmath90 e nm and @xmath91 nm ) .",
    "we apply a cw laser with intensity @xmath92 w/@xmath88 , which is an intensity belonging to the strong field regime .",
    "the angular frequency of the cw field equals the excitonic transition eigenfrequency ( resonance condition ) .",
    "we observe that eof reaches a maximum value of approximately 0.355 and a steady state of around the same value .",
    "actually in all cases investigated we have found that ( a ) the time evolution of eof shows a very similar time evolution , showing a maximum value and then a plateau region describing the steady state and ( b ) a value about 0.355 is the maximum value of eof that can be achieved .",
    "then , we systematically investigate the case of cw driving with photon energy different than the exciton energy of each sqd , i.e. a detuned cw laser is driving our hybrid system . in fig .",
    "[ fig : eofw ] we plotted the steady state of eof as a function of detuning .",
    "a strong dependence of the steady state eof on the applied angular frequency is reported as for detunings outside the window [ @xmath930.110,+0.088 ] the steady state quantum entanglement practically vanishes .",
    "moreover , the plot shows a slightly non - symmetric dependence of the steady state eof on the detuning , showing a maximum value for a very small positive detuning .",
    "it is very important to report that an unexpected behavior is reported when the mnp particle is removed . in that case",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : eofw2 ] ) we have found that the hybrid system no longer reaches a steady state with the density matrix elements and hence the eof oscillating within a narrow envelope . in fig .",
    "[ fig : eofw2 ] the response of the system shows an unexpected discontinuity of eof and the density matrix elements ( not shown here ) for detuning near @xmath940.05 mev .",
    "this is definitely not a numerical artifact as we have repeated our numeric runs with gradually increasing accuracy and always found the same behavior .",
    "a convincing picture for the later argument is the inset of fig .",

    "[ fig : eofw2 ] with the one of the fig .",
    "[ fig : eofw ] .",
    "the observed behavior becomes even more difficult to comprehend once we realize that the absence of the nanoparticles becomes the system description much simpler as all the nonlinear terms disappear ( see the equations at the theory section describing @xmath95 , @xmath96 and the polarization of the mnp ) .    in order to better understand our findings",

    "@xcite we have found that when the sqd - sqd symmetry is broken explicitly the frequency range over which the system displays the unexpected oscillatory behavior increases ( not shown ) .    here , we point out that the time evolution in all cases studied in the case of direct coupling of sqds is very complicated and more structured than the usual dynamic picture of fig .

    "the observed unexpected behavior of fig .",
    "[ fig : eofw2 ] can be explained by means of the relaxation matrix by means of which we have treated the sqds relaxation in a non - collective manner ( see ref .",
    "a characteristic consequence of the latest statement appears in the observation that the double excited state ( i.e. both sqds are excited ) relaxes into both symmetric and antisymmetric states with equal probabilities . where the symmetric state is @xmath97 and the antisymmetric state is @xmath98 .",
    "we note that the authors of ref . @xcite",
    "have attributed this unstable oscillatory behavior observed in the strong sqd - sqd coupling regime to the semiclassical approach model for the coupling between the two sqds and to the type of decoherence ( collective or non - collective ) present in the system .",
    "however , it has been stated that when the sqd - sqd interacton is modeled in a more quantum mechanical manner this unstable behavior is absent @xcite .",
    "then , we systematically study the dependence of eof of the hybrid system on the various parameters of the system .",
    "hence , we mainly study steady state eof as a function of the hybrid system geometrical parameters , i.e. size of mnp , dipole moments and the position of the sqds , and the external parameters , i.e. mainly the external field , the dielectric constant of the surrounding environment and the relaxation times of the sqds .",
