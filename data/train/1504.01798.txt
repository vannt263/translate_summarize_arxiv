    "measurements @xcite and standard model ( sm ) calculations @xcite of the primordial abundances of the light elements produced during big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) provide a valuable probe into physics beyond the sm , including axion - like pseudoscalar dark matter ( dm ) @xcite , neutrinos and relativistic non - sm particles in the early universe @xcite , dm reactions during bbn @xcite , variations of the fundamental constants of nature @xcite and supersymmetric models @xcite .",

    "the stringency of the constraints arises due to the high energy density of dm in the early universe compared with that at present , which enhances the effects of any possible variations of the fundamental constants due to the underlying field @xmath1 .    in the present letter ,",
    "we derive constraints on the mass of a scalar dm particle @xmath1 together with its interactions with the photon , light quarks and massive vector bosons via quadratic couplings in @xmath1 , as well as its interactions with massive vector bosons via linear couplings in @xmath1 , by comparing the measured and calculated ( within the sm ) primordial abundance of @xmath0he , which is predominantly determined by the ratio of the neutron - proton mass difference to freeze - out temperature at the time of weak interaction freeze - out prior to bbn .",
    "we also derive a constraint on the quadratic interaction of @xmath1 with the photon from recent atomic dysprosium spectroscopy measurements .",
    "our constraints are found to rule out large regions of previously unconstrained scalar dm parameter space .",
    "in the present work , we consider a scalar dm field @xmath1 , which can couple to the sm fields via the following linear - in-@xmath1 interactions : @xmath2 where the sum runs over all sm fermions @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the standard mass of the fermion , @xmath3 is the fermion dirac field and @xmath5 , @xmath6 where @xmath7 are the components of the electromagnetic field tensor , and @xmath8 where the sum runs over all sm massive vector bosons @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the standard mass of the boson and @xmath11 are the components of the wavefunction of the corresponding massive vector boson .",

    "there are two limiting cases of particular interest to consider :    \\(i ) @xmath1 is an oscillating field and interacts via sm particles via quadratic couplings in @xmath1 .",
    "this occurs when @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the mass of the scalar dm particle and @xmath20 is the hubble parameter as a function of time @xcite .",

    "\\(ii ) @xmath1 is a non - oscillating field and interacts with sm particles via linear or quadratic couplings in @xmath1 .",
    "this occurs when @xmath24 .",
    "the energy density of a non - oscillating scalar dm field is given by @xmath25 and , due to hubble friction , is approximately constant while the field remains non - oscillating : @xmath26 ^ 3   \\frac{\\textrm{gev}}{\\textrm{cm}^3 }   , \\ ] ] where @xmath27 is defined by @xmath28 .",
    "for constraining the parameters of scalar dm from measurements and sm calculations of the primordial abundance of @xmath0he , it suffices to consider only the effects of variation of the fundamental constants due to scalar dm on the ratio of the neutron - proton mass difference to freeze - out temperature at the time of weak interaction freeze - out ( @xmath29 s ) , which determines the abundance of neutrons available for bbn ( the vast majority of these neutrons are ultimately locked up in @xmath0he ) .",
    "the corresponding range of scalar dm particle masses for ( i ) is hence @xmath30 ev , while the corresponding range of scalar dm particle masses for ( ii ) is @xmath31 ev .",
    "the loosest constraints on the parameters of @xmath1 are obtained by assuming that @xmath1 is a non - relativistic cold field at all times , which is produced either non - thermally ( through vacuum decay @xcite ) or thermally ( with a very large mass ) .",
    "an example of a cold scalar dm field is a classical oscillating condensate , @xmath32 , which oscillates with frequency @xmath33 .",
    "we note that bbn and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) measurements do not rule out the existence of a relativistic scalar dm field @xcite , and that a relativistic scalar dm field should provide even more stringent constraints on the underlying parameters than those derived in the present work , since for a relativistic oscillating dm field , the mean dm energy density evolves according to @xmath34 ^ 4 $ ] .",
    "constraints on scalar dm parameters follow from measurements and sm calculations of the abundance of @xmath0he produced during bbn , which depends strongly on the neutron - to - proton ratio at the time of the weak interaction freeze - out ( @xmath35 mev @xcite ) , where @xmath36 is the weak interaction freeze - out temperature , @xmath37 is the weinberg angle , @xmath38 is the electromagnetic fine - structure constant , @xmath39 is the planck mass and @xmath40 is a numerical constant .",
