    "blazars , including bl lac objects and flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) , are the most extreme subclass of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "most of the identified extragalactic @xmath0-ray sources belong to this category .",
    "their emission is believed to be dominated by non - thermal and strongly doppler - boosted radiation from a relativistic jet of magnetized plasma which is aligned along our line of sight . the physical mechanism for the production of their @xmath0-ray emission is still under debate .",
    "the leptonic models attribute the @xmath0-ray emission to the inverse compton scattering of the synchrotron ( synchrotron self - compton , ssc ) or external photons ( external compton , ec ) by the same population of relativistic electrons @xcite , therefore an x - ray/@xmath0-ray correlation is expected .",
    "the lack of strong emission lines in the radiation from bl lac objects is taken as one of the evidences for a minor role of ambient photons ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and hence the ssc model is favored .",
    "the hadronic models attribute the @xmath0-ray emission to proton - initiated cascades and/or proton - synchrotron emission in a magnetic field - dominated jet @xcite .",
    "however , the tight x - ray and very high energy ( vhe ) @xmath0-ray correlation and the very rapid @xmath0-ray variability are taken as the strong challenges to models based on hadronic processes .",
    "recently , a long - term continuous monitoring of mrk 421 has been performed based on the argo - ybj experiment and satellite borne x - ray detectors @xcite . according to this investigation , both the temporal and the spectral results generally favor the ssc model . even in the framework of the ssc model",
    ", the fundamental question referred to the origin of the flux and spectral variability , observed on timescales from minutes to tens of years , is still open .",
    "mrk 501 ( z = 0.034 ) was discovered with vhe emission by the whipple collaboration @xcite .",
    "it is one of the best - studied blazars with extensive studies on various timescales . in 1997 , mrk 501 went into a state with surprisingly high activity and strong variability and became more than a factor 10 brighter ( above 1 tev ) than the crab nebula @xcite .",
    "the fastest @xmath0-ray flux variability on a timescale of minutes was observed in 2005 @xcite .",
    "significant spectral variability was detected with the harder spectrum at the brighter states compared to the low - activity states @xcite . in the middle of 2009 , a multi - frequency observational campaign for 4.5 months on mrk 501 was carried out with excellent energy coverage from radio to vhe @xmath0-ray when it underwent a low activity @xcite . throughout the campaign ,",
    "the source was sampled quite uniformly in all wavelength bands except for the vhe band , because the cherenkov telescopes can not operate during non - optimal weather conditions or bright moonlight periods . in october 2011 , mrk 501 underwent a strong flare detected by the maxi satellite in x - rays @xcite and by the argo - ybj detector in vhe @xmath0-rays @xcite .    to understand the variability of emission and the underlying acceleration and radiation mechanisms in jets , continuous multi - wavelength observations from the x - ray to the vhe @xmath0-ray band are crucial especially over a very long term .",
    "the broad band energy spectra could provide constraints on the parameters of the models .",
    "the cherenkov telescopes can not constantly monitor agns because of their limited duty cycle and narrow field of view ( fov ) .",
    "the wide - fov argo - ybj detector , operated with high duty cycle ( @xmath3 ) , is more suitable for monitoring .",
    "working at energies above 300 gev , argo - ybj extends the multi - wavelength survey carried out by the satellite borne x - ray detector @xmath4 and the gev @xmath0-ray detector @xmath5-lat .",
    "particularly , the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of mrk 501 is covered without any gap from 100 mev to 10 tev .",
    "all the measurements would set strong constrains on the model of the emission of agns .    in this paper",
    ", we report on the multi - wavelength view of the emission from mrk 501 from august 2008 to april 2012 , including the average spectra during quasi - steady and flaring periods .",
    "the argo - ybj experiment , located at the cosmic ray laboratory of yangbajing ( tibet , p.r . china ) at an altitude of 4300 m a.s.l . , is the result of a collaboration among chinese and italian institutions and is designed for vhe @xmath0-ray astronomy and cosmic ray observations .",
    "the detector consists of a single layer of resistive plate chambers ( rpcs ) , which are equipped with charge readout strips ( 6.75 cm @xmath6 61.80 cm each ) .",
    "the logical or of signals from eight neighboring strips constitutes the pixel ( called a `` pad '' ) for triggering and timing purposes .",
    "each rpc is read with ten pixels .",
    "130 clusters ( each composed of 12 rpcs ) are installed to form a carpet of about 5600 m@xmath7 with an active area of @xmath893% .",
    "this central carpet is surrounded by 23 additional clusters ( `` guard ring '' ) .",
    "the total area of the array is 110 m @xmath6 100 m. the argo - ybj detector is operated by requiring the number of fired pads ( @xmath9 ) to be at least 20 within 420 ns on the entire carpet .",
    "the trigger rate is 3.5 khz with a dead time of 4% .",
    "the angular resolution , pointing accuracy and stability of the argo - ybj detector array have been thoroughly tested by measuring the shadow of the moon in cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "the absolute energy scale uncertainty is less than 13% for all measured cosmic ray showers @xcite .",
    "more details about the detector and the rpc performance can be found in @xcite .    for the multi - wavelength investigation together with @xmath5-lat , the data collected by argo - ybj after august 2008 when @xmath5 was launched are used .",
    "the total effective observation time is 1179.6 days . to achieve a good angular resolution , events with zenith angle less than 50@xmath10",
    "are used , and further selection criteria @xcite are applied .",
    "the total number of events after filtering is @xmath1110@xmath12 for this work . no @xmath0/hadron discrimination is applied .",
    "the opening angle @xmath13 , which contains 71.5% of the events from a point - like source , is 1.36@xmath10 for events with @xmath14 . in order to remove the effect of the cosmic - ray anisotropy , the method described in @xcite was applied .",
    "the significance of the excess is estimated using the @xcite method . with this data analysis ,",
    "the significance of the excess observed from the direction of the crab nebula is 17 standard deviations ( @xmath1 ) in 3.5 years , which indicates that the 3.5-year cumulative 5 @xmath1 sensitivity of argo - ybj has reached 0.3 crab unit for point sources @xcite .",
    "the daily flux from mrk 501 at energy 15@xmath1550kev provided by @xmath4/bat / bat team : http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/swift/ results / transients / weak / mrk501/. ] is publicly available and used in this work .",
    "the light curve from august 2008 to april 2012 is shown in panel ( a ) of figure  [ fig1 ] with a bin size of 30 days .",
    "the best fit with a constant value for the light curve is ( 8.9@xmath20.4)@xmath16 counts @xmath17 s@xmath18 with a @xmath19 of 492.9 for 44 degrees of freedom ( ndf ) .",
    "a significant feature is the flare at the end of 2011 with the flux being enhanced by a factor about 4 . without data during the flaring period , the best fit with a constant value for the light curve is ( 6.0@xmath20.4)@xmath16 counts @xmath17 s@xmath18 with a @xmath20 of 69.3/38 .",
    "this result could be an evidence for a small x - ray variability before this flaring period . zooming in the @xmath4/bat light curve at 15@xmath1550 kev shown in figure  [ fig2 ] ,",
    "the large flare started in october 17 , 2011 ( mjd=55851 ) and decreased to a low - activity state around the average level on november 22 ( mjd=55887)(flare 1 hereafter ) .",
    "afterwards , mrk 501 became increasingly active for a longer period up to about april 2012 .",
    "its brightest flaring episode is in november 8 , 2011 , during the flare 1 period .",
    "the @xmath5-lat data were analyzed using the sciencetools .",
    "the light curve is generated using aperture photometry .",
    "the panel ( b ) of figure  [ fig1 ] shows the flux at energies greater than 0.3 gev that is contained within a 2-degree cone centered on mrk 501 , which is the 68% containment angle of the reconstructed incoming photon direction for normal incidence .",
    "a fit with a constant value yields a @xmath20 of 107.7/44 indicating a moderately variable behavior consistent with the x - ray analysis .",
    "the discrete correlation function ( dcf ) , computed as prescribed by @xcite , for the bat / lat data points shown in figure  [ fig1 ] is dcf = 0.63@xmath20.26 for a time lag of zero , which is greater than the previously measured dcf = 0.32@xmath20.22 @xcite . since the significance in both analysis is less than 2.5@xmath1 , only minor correlations are observed . during the x - ray flaring period ,",
    "the gev @xmath0-ray flux increased above the long - term average , but this flux increase is not significant .",
    "therefore , the light curve does not indicate a significant correlation with the x - ray data during the flare .",
    "the light curve in the tev @xmath0-ray range detected by argo - ybj is shown in panel ( c ) of figure  [ fig1 ] . during the x - ray flare",
    ", the flux of tev @xmath0-rays also increases .",
    "a fit with a constant emitting rate yields a @xmath20 of 71.9/44 , while the @xmath20 is reduced to 42.59/38 by simply excluding the data during the x - ray flares .",
    "the tev @xmath0-ray flare 1 was clearly detected as a counterpart of that in the x - ray band , and the count rate increase is by a factor about 6 .",
    "the dcf for the bat / argo - ybj data points shown in figure  [ fig1 ] is 0.85@xmath20.36 for a time lag of zero , while the dcf for the lat / argo - ybj is 0.44@xmath20.31 .      to investigate the evolution of the spectra ,",
    "their time - averages during the long - term quasi - steady state from august 5 , 2008 to october 16 , 2011 and during flare 1 are estimated separately .",
    "the integrated flux from mrk 501 observed by argo - ybj has a statistical significance of 5 @xmath1 ( see panel ( a ) of figure  [ fig3 ] ) . during flare 1 ,",
    "the flux from mrk 501 was detected by argo - ybj with 6.1 @xmath1 significance ( see panel ( b ) of figure  [ fig3 ] ) , corresponding to an increase of the @xmath0-ray flux above 1 tev by a factor of 6.6 from its steady emission .",
    "events with @xmath14 are used for both panels of figure  [ fig3 ] . for comparison ,",
    "all the spectra are shown in figure  [ fig4 ] , where an average spectrum over 4.5 months was adapted from @xcite . without significant activity observed in the last 3 years before flare 1 , the average spectra over 4.5 months could approximately represent the average spectra over 3 years .",
    "all the other spectra presented in figure  [ fig4 ] are estimated as described in the following .",
    "the @xmath4/xrt is a focusing x - ray telescope with energy range from 0.2 to 10 kev . in windowed timing mode during flare 1 , xrt data in four time windows are available from heasarc , and the exposure time is about 1 ks in each window .",
    "the xrt data set was processed with the xrtdas software package ( v.2.6.0 ) following the standard recommendations .",
    "the xrt average spectrum in the 0.5@xmath1510 kev energy band was fitted using the xspec package ( v.12.7.0 ) .",
    "we adopted a power - law model for the photon - flux spectral density , with an absorption hydrogen - equivalent column density fixed to the galactic value in the direction of the source , namely @xmath21 @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "we obtain the spectrum of @xmath23 @xmath24 .",
    "the lat data from a region centered on mrk 501 with radius of @xmath25 was used to estimate the spectrum .",
    "the data analysis was performed following the standard recommendations by using an unbinned maximum - likelihood method to estimate the source sed .",
    "we adopted a power - law model for the energy range from 0.1 to 300 gev . during the long - term period ,",
    "mrk 501 was detected with a test statistic ( ts ) value of 5118.2 ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "we obtain the spectrum @xmath27 @xmath28 .",
    "this is consistent with the result reported by the lat collaboration using the data collected during the first 24 months @xcite .",
    "the spectrum was found to be very stable in the gev band in spite of a moderate variability over a long period . during flare 1 ,",
    "the ts was 329.1 ( @xmath29 ) and the spectrum was @xmath30 @xmath28 . compared with the long - term result ,",
    "the flux increased slightly .",
    "the vhe @xmath0-ray spectrum was estimated using a distribution of the excess in the number of events as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "a widely used procedure , that is described in @xcite , was followed . in this procedure , the spectrum of mrk 501 was assumed to be a power law .",
    "the argo - ybj detector response has been taken into account using g4argo @xcite .",
    "the simulated events are sampled in the energy range from 10 gev to 100 tev .",
    "we define six intervals with @xmath9 of 20@xmath1559 , 60@xmath1599 , 100@xmath15199 , 200@xmath15499 , 500@xmath15999 and @xmath311000 .",
    "the best fit gives a differential flux(@xmath32 ) @xmath33 for the long - term period , corresponding to 0.312@xmath20.076 crab units above 1 tev .",
    "the median energies of the six intervals are 0.45 , 0.89 , 1.4 , 2.8 , 5.6 and 11 tev , respectively .",
    "both the flux and the spectral index are similar to those obtained by veritas and magic during the low - activity state , as presented in @xcite . in particular , the argo - ybj data show a smooth extension of the @xmath5-lat results , as evident in figure  [ fig4 ] . during flare 1 , the differential flux ( @xmath32 ) is @xmath34 corresponding to 2.05@xmath20.48 crab units above 1 tev , that is a factor 6.6@xmath22.2 compared with its long - term steady state .",
    "the median energies of the six intervals are 0.89 , 1.1 , 1.8 , 3.5 , 7.1 and 14 tev , respectively .",
    "only the statistical error is quoted here , and the systematic uncertainty in the flux measurement is estimated to be @xmath3530% @xcite .",
    "during flare 1 , @xmath0-rays with a median energy of 8.4 tev are also observed with a significance greater than 4@xmath1 , as shown in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "@xmath0-rays with such a high energy from mrk 501 have not been detected since the 1997 flare .",
    "the sed at energies above 0.9 tev is harder than those observed during the flares in 1997 @xcite and in june 30 , 2005 flare @xcite , as shown in figure  [ fig4 ] , although the spectral indices are consistent if the statistical error is taken into account .",
    "mrk 501 is a nearby source , so we do not expect a significant absorption of its intrinsic source spectrum due to extragalactic background light ( ebl ) at energies below 1 tev , while the absorption at higher energies is still considerable .",
    "therefore , it is useful to test different ebl models assuming a minimum intrinsic photon spectral index .",
    "a natural minimum spectral index is 1.64 , constrained by the spectrum in the gev band , since that at higher energies should be steeper .",
    "here we use four kinds of models with different flux levels of the ebl , among many models . assuming a single power law for the vhe flux , the indices of the derived unabsorbed spectra using different models are:(1)@xmath36 for the  low - ir \" model proposed by @xcite , which gives a similar result compared with that obtained using the ebl model of @xcite , according to @xcite ; ( 2 ) @xmath37 for the model of @xcite , which is widely used to correct the vhe sed of extragalactic sources ; ( 3,4)@xmath38 and @xmath39 for the baseline and fast evolution models proposed by @xcite , respectively . for comparison ,",
    "all the unabsorbed spectra are shown in figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "the spectral indices obtained using models ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) exceed the minimum spectral index boundary of 1.64 , however they are consistent with this limit if the statistical error is taken into account .",
    "it has to be noted that models ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) have been excluded with higher significance by previous tests carried out around 1 tev @xcite and tens of gev @xcite .",
    "since our data extend to about 10 tev , the corresponding ebl photon energy is substantially lower . the ebl model with the minimum absorption",
    "is used when modeling the sed in the following section .",
    "the long - term averaged sed , especially the continuous measurement of the second component in the energy range 0.1 gev-10 tev obtained in this work , provides us a robust baseline for an insight into the underlying physics in mrk 501 . over the very wide radio - vhe energy range",
    ", we fitted a one - zone ssc model proposed by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to the sed .",
    "there are a few free parameters to be determined in this model , including the doppler factor @xmath40 $ ] , the spherical blob radius r , the magnetic field strength @xmath41 , the electron spectral index @xmath42 , the electron maximum lorentz factor @xmath43 , and the electron injection compactness @xmath44 . in order to determine the doppler factor and the injection compactness ,",
    "further parameters must be determined , i.e. , the lorentz factor @xmath45 , the speed of the blob @xmath46 and the lorentz factor of electrons @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , @xmath47 is the thomson cross section , @xmath48 the angle between the direction of motion of the blob and the observer s line of sight , and @xmath49 the electron spectrum at injection , which is assumed to be a power law cutting off at @xmath43 , with a normalization factor @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "this model is different from other one - zone ssc models which introduce more free parameters using stationary injected electron spectra with a double power - law function @xcite or even triple power - law function @xcite with an exponential cutoff at their high energy end .",
    "a full time - dependent evolution of the electron and photon spectra based on this model was simulated for a given injection spectrum of electrons .",
    "the low - ir model proposed by @xcite is used to take into account the absorption of @xmath0-rays in the ebl when modeling the sed .",
    "the best fit to the long - term sed is shown in figure  [ fig4 ] , with the corresponding parameters given in table 1 .",
    "general agreement between the model and the data is achieved with this simple one - zone ssc model .",
    "the parameters in the model are found in general agreement with those found in the previous analysis on the similar source mrk 421 @xcite .",
    "the best fit for the flare 1 is also shown in figure  [ fig4 ] , with the corresponding parameters given in table 1 .",
    "the highest - energy data points of the sed ( @xmath52 tev ) during flare 1 can not be well reproduced by only modifying the parameters .",
    "it is important to point out that the x - ray spectrum becomes harder during the flare .",
    "the peak energy is shifted to about 10 kev during flare 1 from about 1 kev in the quasi - steady state .",
    "the shift of the x/@xmath0-ray peak to higher energies during flares is a common feature which has been reported many times ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , the detection of @xmath536 tev @xmath0-rays with an energy flux similar to that at 1 tev is unusual . in the framework of the ssc model ,",
    "it is difficult to reproduce such high energy @xmath0-rays as detected by argo - ybj .",
    "since the @xmath0-rays above 1 tev are typically produced in the klein - nishina regime , their rate should be strongly suppressed . the radiation mechanism during flares may be different from that in the quasi - steady state .",
    "different radiation mechanisms , such as more complex ssc models or hadronic processes ( e.g. in @xcite ) , are needed to improve the understanding of the flaring phenomena .",
    "we have presented a continuous long - term monitoring of mrk 501 from august 2008 to april 2012 . both the flux and the spectral index are consistent with those obtained by veritas and magic during a 4.5 month long multifrequency campaign @xcite . combining the observations by the argo - ybj experiment with the space - borne experiments @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the investigation was performed over a wide energy range from 0.5 kev up to 10 tev ( a value higher than the maximum in @xcite ) . using all the data covering various energy bands during the quasi - steady phase of the blazar , its sed is fitted with a simple one - zone ssc model assuming a single power - law with exponential cutoff for the electron spectrum at injection .",
    "the model parameters are found in agreement with those resulting from previous analyses for various agns , indicating that similar radiation mechanisms are in action .",
    "a strong flare of the blazar in the vhe region was observed by argo - ybj in october 2011 , while no cherenkov telescope could observe mrk 501 during this period .",
    "it is well determined to be a counterpart of the x - ray flare in the same time period , giving for the bat / argo - ybj data points a dcf of 0.85@xmath20.36 for a time lag of zero . on the contrary",
    ", there is no significant increase of the flux at energies around 1 gev .",
    "remarkably , @xmath0-rays with energies above 8 tev are detected , which did not happen since the 1997 flare .",
    "the spectral shape obtained with the data in the gev / tev energy region during the flare favors the  low - ir \" ebl model of @xcite , while a simple one - zone ssc model with a single power - law electron spectrum at injection is not able to reproduce the spectral shape at the highest energies ( above 6 tev ) .",

    "<S> as one of the brightest active blazars in both x - ray and very high energy @xmath0-ray bands , mrk 501 is very useful for physics associated with jets from agns . </S>",
    "<S> the argo - ybj experiment is monitoring it for @xmath0-rays above 0.3 tev since november 2007 . starting from october 2011 </S>",
    "<S> the largest flare since 2005 is observed , which lasts to about april 2012 . in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> a detailed analysis is reported . during the brightest @xmath0-rays flaring episodes from october 17 to november 22 , 2011 , </S>",
    "<S> an excess of the event rate over 6 @xmath1 is detected by argo - ybj in the direction of mrk 501 , corresponding to an increase of the @xmath0-ray flux above 1 tev by a factor of 6.6@xmath22.2 from its steady emission . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the @xmath0-ray flux above 8 tev is detected with a significance better than 4 @xmath1 . based on time - dependent synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) processes , </S>",
    "<S> the broad - band energy spectrum is interpreted as the emission from an electron energy distribution parameterized with a single power - law function with an exponential cutoff at its high energy end . the average spectral energy distribution for the steady emission is well described by this simple one - zone ssc model . however , the detection of @xmath0-rays above 8 tev during the flare challenges this model due to the hardness of the spectra . </S>",
    "<S> correlations between x - rays and @xmath0-rays are also investigated . </S>"
