    "the search for free - floating brown dwarfs ( hereafter referred to as bds ) has finally been proved succesful .",
    "after years of continuous efforts to detect intrinsically fainter and less massive objects both in the field and in open star clusters ( see e.g. the reviews by jameson @xcite and reid @xcite ) , the recent photometric survey of a small sky area in the pleiades ( age 70120  myr ) by zapatero osorio , rebolo & martn ( @xcite ) ( hereafter paper  i ) has provided objects that according to all available evolutionary models are beyond the substellar limit ( rebolo , zapatero osorio & martn @xcite ; martn , rebolo & zapatero osorio @xcite ) .",
    "the genuine bd nature of two of them has been confirmed by the detection of high lithium abundances in their atmospheres ( rebolo et al .",
    "the re - appearance of lithium in objects at the bottom of the pleiades main sequence ( ms ) has helped to empirically define the borderline that separates very low - mass stars from bds . at present ,",
    "both sides of the substellar limit are populated with several objects which may allow us to establish qualitative and quantitative differences between them and also with respect to other field objects with similar spectral types .",
    "martn et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have started to approach this issue using intermediate - resolution optical spectroscopy . in this paper",
    ", we examine this problem using near - infrared photometry .",
    "we have obtained @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath8 magnitudes for some pleiades very low - mass stars selected from the literature , as well as for the most interesting objects in the optical survey presented in paper i. we will focus here on the utility of combining both optical and infrared photometry to identify true pleiades bds , disentangle binarity effects and discriminate cluster members from contaminants that appear in optical surveys .",
    "these observations are mainly aimed at characterizing the cluster substellar borderline and studying the infrared sequence that connects pleiades least massive stars with bds .",
    "our sample is presented in table  1 where we have avoided the term `` pleiades '' for those objects taken from paper  i. all objects in the sample have measured spectral types equal or later than m6 , and they could be located around the substellar limit in the pleiades cluster according to their @xmath7 magnitudes and ( @xmath11 ) colours .",
    "ppl  15 ( discovered by stauffer , hamilton & probst @xcite ) is the m6.5-type pleiad that at present defines the borderline which separates very low - mass stars from bds in the cluster .",
    "this is based on the fact that ppl  15 has preserved some of its initial lithium content .",
    "the comparison with theoretical models ( basri , marcy & graham @xcite ; rebolo et al .",
    "@xcite ) yields that the most likely mass of ppl  15 is @xmath20.08  @xmath1 .",
    "hhj  2 ( m6.5 ) , hhj  3 ( m6 ) and hhj  6 ( m6.5 ) are proper motion members taken from hambly , hawkins & jameson ( @xcite ) .",
    "their optical - infrared magnitudes and spectral types ( steele & jameson @xcite ) place these objects close to the substellar limit , but still on the stellar domain .",
    "hhj  3 has depleted its lithium ( marcy , basri & graham @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , none of the hhj objects in our sample shows lithium in their atmospheres ( basri 1996 , private communication ) , implying that all of them have masses larger than 0.08  @xmath1 and therefore , they are among the least massive stars in the cluster",
    ". there are no lithium observations available for ppl  1 ( m6.5 ) ( stauffer et al .",
    "@xcite ) , but it has a photometry very similar to that of hhj  3 , and a radial velocity consistent with membership .",
    "the remaining objects in our sample are taken from the optical survey of paper  i from which two genuine bds have emerged , namely teide  1 ( m8 ) and calar  3 ( m8 ) .",
    "both have successfully passed the lithium test ( rebolo et al .",
    "@xcite ) . according to their radial velocities and spectral types , calar  1 ( m9 ) , calar  2 ( m6 ) , calar  5 ( m6.5 ) and roque  1 ( m7 ) seem to be non - members of the pleiades ( martn et al .",
    "the infrared photometry will shed new light on their membership in the cluster .",
    "the @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath8 observations were performed in 1996 february  9 at the 4.2  m william herschel telescope ( wht , observatorio del roque de los muchachos on the island of la palma , spain ) , using the whircam infrared camera equipped with an insb ( 256@xmath12256 ) detector array .",
    "this detector provided 0.24 pixels and a field of view of @xmath21@xmath13@xmath121@xmath13 .",
    "the standard @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath14 infrared filter set was used .",
    "the total integration time per object and per filter was 50  s , where each final image actually consisted of 5 co - added 10  s exposures .",
    "raw data were processed using standard techniques within the iraf environment .",
    "dark frames were first substracted from the images before combining them in order to obtain good flat - fields for each filter . then",
    ", individual frames were divided by the normalized , mean flat - field .",
    "the photometric analysis was carried out using routines within daophot .",
    "weather conditions during the campaign were always fairly photometric .",
    "instrumental aperture magnitudes were corrected for atmospheric extinction and transformed into the ukirt system using observations at different airmasses of the standards fs  9 and fs  12 ( casali & hawarden @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath14 data were converted to the @xmath8-band magnitudes using the transformation equation given in wainscoat & cowie ( @xcite ) .",
    "we estimate that the accuracy in the final magnitudes is 0.05  mag at each wavelength .",
    "the final @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath8 photometry of the sample is provided in table  1 .",
    "our magnitudes are in good agreement within @xmath00.1  mag with those found in the literature for the objects in common ( hhj and ppl objects ) , except for the @xmath8-band of ppl  15 , where a difference of 0.18  mag is observed with respect to basri et al.s ( @xcite ) data in the sense that our result is brighter .",
    "we have only a @xmath9 measurement for hhj  3 ; for completeness in table  1 , @xmath10 and @xmath8 magnitudes in the ukirt system were taken from steele , jameson & hambly ( @xcite ) .",
    ".infrared photometry [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     all isochrones reproduce qualitatively the general trend of the observational data .",
    "however , within the age range assumed for the pleiades ( 70150  myr ) , the models of burrows et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and dantona & mazzitelli ( @xcite ) predict rather blue ( @xmath15 ) colours and/or faint @xmath8 magnitudes . only for very young ages",
    ", those isochrones would fit the pleiades data , implying that cluster members like the faintest hhj objects should have preserved lithium , clearly in desagreement with the lithium observations of these stars .",
    "this discrepancy for very low - masses was also noted in terms of effective temperature and luminosity in the @xmath16  persei cluster by zapatero osorio et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the 70  myr evolutionary track of burrows et al .",
    "( @xcite ) seems to coincide with that of the ` nextgen ' 120  myr isochrone of chabrier et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . for a given age , burrows et al.s models predict effective temperatures that are hotter by 150100  k than those predicted by chabrier et al . , and luminosities that are slightly brighter by 0.030.015  dex in the mass range in common for both theoretical models . the differences between the two sets of isochrones of baraffe et al .",
    "( ` base ' ) and chabrier et al .",
    "( ` nextgen ' ) are remarkable , e.g. , given an age and a mass the ( @xmath15 ) offset could be as large as 0.5  mag .",
    "the ` base ' model atmospheres have been improved recently by including more accurate molecular line lists , yielding the ` nextgen ' models .",
    "these are claimed to reproduce the observations better than previous sets of computations ( see allard et al .",
    "@xcite ; baraffe & chabrier @xcite ; chabrier et al .",
    "@xcite ) . however , the masses that are inferred from the comparison of our data with the ` nextgen ' models in fig",
    ".  4 are lower by a factor @xmath21.25 than those obtained from the lithium test .",
    "this is basically due to the apparent different age that is derived from the isochrones in fig .",
    "4 ( 70  myr , the canonical age of the cluster ) , and from the combination of lithium and luminosity of objects close to the substellar limit ( 120  myr , basri et al .",
    "@xcite ) . since the input molecular line lists for computing synthetic spectra for cool temperatures",
    "are incomplete , colours and magnitudes measured on these spectra are hampered by uncertainties of @xmath20.5  mag ( chabrier et al .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand , masses obtained from lithium are more reliable because they are based on the simpler physics of the interior of fully - convective objects ( magazz , martn & rebolo @xcite ; bildsten et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in order to bring the masses obtained from the @xmath8 vs @xmath15 diagram into agreement with those inferred from the lithium test for an age of 120  myr",
    ", it would be required to shift the ` nextgen ' isochrone by about 0.4  mag towards redder colour , which is within the theoretical uncertainties estimated by chabrier et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the sequence of very low - mass stars and bds in the pleiades is depicted in fig .",
    "4 . our suggested decomposition for hhj  6 and",
    "ppl  15 is indicated .",
    "the location of the likely companions nicely fits the sequence of single members .",
    "we consider that the primary of ppl  15 defines the transition region between stars and bds , i.e. masses within 0.080.075  @xmath1 , and we propose that its photometry could be adopted as indicative of the location of the substellar limit in the pleiades .",
    "the derived absolute magnitudes are listed in table  3 , where the interval of values corresponds to the above mass range .",
    "we have estimated the star - bd frontier for older clusters like the hyades , as well as for objects of different ages in the field using the isochrones of chabrier et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ( nextgen model atmospheres ) normalized to the primary of ppl  15 .",
    "we consider the theoretical magnitude differences associated to different ages in order to evolve from the pleiades to 600 , 1000 and 5000  myr .",
    "we have also inferred the spectral types of the objects at the substellar limit   shown in the last column of table  3   by comparing our @xmath17 , @xmath15 and @xmath18 colours with those of kirkpatrick & mccarthy ( @xcite ) for field objects .",
    "we obtain fainter magnitudes and cooler spectral types than suggested by the mass - luminosity and mass - spectral type relationships proposed by henry & mccarthy ( @xcite ) and kirkpatrick & mccarthy ( @xcite ) respectively .",
    "our results are in better agreement with those of baraffe & chabrier ( @xcite ) . at the age of the hyades ,",
    "the substellar limit has moved to m9 spectral type ; for example , cluster objects with the mass of the primary of ppl  15 might show a spectrum similar to a field m9 dwarf , whereas those like teide  1 would have become much cooler .",
    "field very late - m dwarfs ( m7m10 ) are likely older than 1000  myr and , therefore , most of them should be very low - mass stars rather than substellar objects .",
    "it is possible that photometric surveys reveal nearby young bds with spectral types earlier than m9m10 in the solar neighbourhood . because of their recent formation",
    "they will be less numerous than stars of similar spectral types in the field , but their relatively higher luminosity will favour detection in all - sky near - infrared surveys like denis and 2mass . the probability of finding these field young bds will depend on the mass function for very low - masses and on the mixture of ages ( see martn , zapatero - osorio & rebolo @xcite )",
    ". the lithium test will be useful in order to establish their substellar nature .",
    "we have presented near - infrared @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath8 photometry for some of the least luminous objects so far known in the pleiades cluster .",
    "they are very low - mass stars approaching the substellar limit , transition objects , and massive bds ( hhj and ppl objects , and calar  3 and teide  1 ) .",
    "in addition , we have also included in our sample four of the bd candidates proposed in paper  i ( calar  1 , 2 , 4 , 5 and roque  1 ) in order to asses their membership on the basis of the infrared data .",
    "we have made use of all the available spectroscopic and photometric knowledge on our final list of objects to characterize the sequence that cluster members around the substellar limit and beyond do follow in the infrared colour - magnitude diagrams .",
    "this sequence is clearly defined by the faintest hhj  objects , ppl  1 , ppl  15 , calar  3 and teide  1 , lying 0.30.4  mag above the field ms for spectral types later than m6 .",
    "objects found in future surveys with similar photometry ( optical and infrared ) should be considered as likely cluster members .",
    "undoubtely , infrared data is highly useful to discriminate those objects that are true pleiades members from those that are not .",
    "optical surveys could be contaminated by background objects that although fitting in the cluster sequence at these wavelengths , may suffer from interestellar reddening .",
    "as extinction affects much less infrared magnitudes , consequently these objects do not match the @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath8 photometry expected for the pleiades ( this is the case of calar  2 and calar  5 ) .",
    "foreground late - type stars are also possible contaminants in photometric surveys , although its contamination is expected to be considerably smaller . however , in the optical survey of paper  i two of these field stars were detected , roque  1 and calar  1 , both having very high radial velocities ( martn et al .",
    "the reddest object in optical wavelengths , calar  1 ( m9 ) , appears to have rather bluer infrared colours than expected for its spectral type .",
    "this together with its high radial velocity suggests membership to an old population .",
    "the large dispersion observed in the infrared photometry of pleiades members is likely attributable to binarity effects .",
    "two objects in our sample , namely hhj  6 and ppl  15 , lie @xmath20.7  mag above the single cluster sequence in infrared diagrams . adopting an age of 120  myr for the cluster and using the photometric data of very low - mass pleiades stars and bds as well as the theoretical tracks of chabrier et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , we have reproduced the photometry of both , finding that the likely masses of the components are 0.085 and 0.085@xmath00.010  @xmath1 for hhj  6 , 0.080 and 0.045@xmath00.010  @xmath1 for ppl  15 .",
    "these results are in fairly good agreement with those obtained from the lithium test .",
    "follow - up infrared spectroscopic observations of ppl  15 should be made to try to detect the effects of the companion on the spectrum , which are expected to be detectable .",
    "since the primary of ppl  15 would be exactly located at the transition region between stars and bds in the pleiades , we have used it to define the empirical location of the substellar limit in infrared diagrams , for which we have corrected the observed magnitudes from the contribution of the secondary .",
    "we have estimated that the star - bd frontier on the single pleiades sequence is located at magnitudes @xmath7  =  17.818.0 , @xmath9  =  15.615.7 , @xmath10  =  14.915.0 and @xmath8  =  14.514.6 and at optical spectral types m6.5m7 .",
    "new pleiades objects that are found fainter along the photometric sequence defined in this paper might be bds indeed . based on this result , we estimate that the hydrogen - burning mass limit occurs at spectral types around m9 in the hyades cluster .",
