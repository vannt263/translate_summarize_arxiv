    "a _ drawing _ @xmath2 of a graph @xmath0 is a representation of the vertices and the edges of @xmath0 by points and by possibly crossing simple jordan arcs connecting the corresponding point pairs , resp .",
    "when it does not lead to confusion , we make no notational or terminological distinction between the vertices ( resp .",
    "edges ) of the underlying abstract graph and the points ( resp .",
    "arcs ) representing them . throughout this paper",
    ", we assume that in a drawing    1 .",
    "no edge passes through any vertex other than its endpoints ; 2 .",
    "any two edges cross only a finite number of times ; 3 .",
    "no three edges cross at the same point ; 4 .",
    "if two edges of a drawing share an interior point @xmath3 then they properly cross at @xmath3 , i.e. , one arc passes from one side of the other arc to the other side ; 5 .",
    "no two vertices have the same @xmath1-coordinate .    a drawing is called _",
    "@xmath1-monotone _ if every vertical line intersects every edge in at most one point .",
    "we call a drawing _ even _ if any two edges cross an even number of times",
    ".    hanani ( chojnacki ) @xcite ( see also @xcite ) proved the remarkable theorem that if a graph @xmath0 permits an even drawing , then it is _ planar _ ,",
    "i.e. , it can be redrawn without any crossing . on the other hand , by fry s theorem @xcite , @xcite",
    ", every planar graph has a straight - line drawing .",
    "we can combine these two facts by saying that every even drawing can be _",
    "`` stretched''_.    the aim of this note is to show that if we restrict our attention to _ @xmath1-monotone _ drawings ,",
    "then every even drawing can be stretched without changing the @xmath1-coordinates of the vertices .",
    "consider an @xmath1-monotone drawing @xmath2 of a graph @xmath0 .",

    "downward ) crosses an edge @xmath5 , then @xmath6 is said to be _ below _",
    "_ above _ ) @xmath7 .",
    "two drawings of the same graph are called _ equivalent _ , if in a small neighborhood of each vertex @xmath4 , the above - below relationships between the edges adjacent to @xmath6 are the same .    in the next two sections we establish the following two results",
    ".    * theorem 1 . * _ for any @xmath1-monotone even drawing of a connected graph , there is an equivalent @xmath1-monotone drawing in which no two edges cross each other and the @xmath1-coordinates of the corresponding vertices are the same . _",
    "* theorem 2 . * _ for any non - crossing @xmath1-monotone drawing of a graph @xmath0 , there is an equivalent non - crossing straight - line drawing , in which the @xmath1-coordinates of the corresponding vertices are the same .",
    "_    two edges are called _ adjacent _ if they share an endpoint .",
    "it is an interesting open problem to decide whether theorem 1 remains true under the weaker assumption that any two _ non - adjacent _ edges cross an even number of times .",
    "hanani s theorem mentioned above is valid in this stronger form .",
    "it was suggested by tutte `` that crossings of adjacent edges are trivial , and easily got rid of . ''",
    "we have been unable to verify this view .",
    "we can assume that @xmath0 is connected .",
    "we follow the approach of cairns and nikolayevsky @xcite .",
    "consider an @xmath1-monotone drawing @xmath8 of a graph on the @xmath9-plane , in which any two edges cross an even number of times .",
    "let @xmath10 and @xmath6 denote the leftmost and rightmost vertex , respectively .",
    "we can assume without loss of generality that @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "introduce two additional vertices , @xmath13 and @xmath14 each connected to @xmath10 and @xmath6 by arcs of length @xmath15 along the unit circle @xmath16 centered at the origin , and suppose that every other edge of the drawing lies in the interior of @xmath16 .",
    "denote by @xmath0 the underlying abstract graph , including the new vertices @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "for each crossing point @xmath3 , attach a _ handle _ ( or bridge ) to the plane in a very small neighborhood @xmath19 of @xmath3 , with radius @xmath20 .",
    "assume that ( 1 ) these neighborhoods are pairwise disjoint , ( 2 ) @xmath19 is disjoint from every other edge that does not pass through @xmath3 , and that ( 3 ) every vertical line intersects every handle only at most once .",
    "for every @xmath3 , take the portion belonging to @xmath19 of one of the edges that participate in the crossing at @xmath3 , and lift it to the handle without changing the @xmath1- and @xmath21-coordinates of its points .",
    "the resulting drawing @xmath22 is a crossing - free embedding of @xmath0 on a surface @xmath23 of possibly higher genus .",
    "let @xmath24 be a very small closed neighborhood of the drawing @xmath22 on the surface @xmath23 , with positive radius @xmath25 .",
    "note that @xmath24 is a compact , connected surface , whose boundary consists of a finite number of closed curves . attaching a disk to each of these closed curves ,",
    "we obtain a surface @xmath26 with no boundary . according to cairns and nikolayevsky @xcite",
    ", @xmath26 must be a @xmath27-dimensional _ sphere_. to verify this claim , consider two closed curves , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , on @xmath26 .",
    "they can be deformed into closed walks , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively , along the edges of @xmath22 .",
    "the projection of these two walks into the @xmath32-plane are closed walks , @xmath33 and @xmath34 in @xmath8 , that must cross each other an even number of times .",
    "every crossing between @xmath33 and @xmath34 occurs either at a vertex of @xmath8 or between two of its edges . by the assumptions , any two edges in @xmath8",
    "cross an even number of times .",
    "( the same assertion is trivially true in @xmath35 , because there no two edges cross . )",
    "using the fact that in @xmath35 the cyclic order of the edges incident to a vertex is the same as the cyclic order of the corresponding edges in @xmath8 , we can conclude that @xmath30 and @xmath31 cross an even number of times , and the same is true for @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "thus , @xmath26 is a surface with no boundary , in which any two closed curves cross an even number of times .",
    "this implies that @xmath26 is a sphere .",
    "consequently , @xmath22 , a crossing - free drawing of @xmath0 on @xmath26 , corresponds to a plane drawing .    for any point @xmath36 ,",
    "let @xmath37 denote the @xmath1-coordinate of @xmath36 .",

    "since @xmath26 is homeomorphic to a sphere , @xmath41 is homeomorphic to a closed disk @xmath42 , whose boundary corresponds to the cycle @xmath38 .",
    "we will define a function @xmath43 on the points @xmath44 such that @xmath45 can be regarded as the  @xmath1-coordinate of @xmath3 . \"",
    "using this function , the drawing @xmath22 can also be regarded as an _",

    "otherwise , by the minimality assumption , we have @xmath61 , @xmath62 . in this case , apply the lemma to the sequence obtained by the deletion of @xmath60 and @xmath59 , and notice that the @xmath63 side of the resulting polygon , whose endpoints have @xmath1-coordinates @xmath64 and @xmath65 , can be replaced by three edges meeting the requirements , running very close to it .",

    ", we have @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 for each @xmath78 , @xmath79 .    in order to justify the claim that @xmath74 can be regarded as the @xmath1-coordinate of @xmath36 in the new drawing , we have to show that for any fixed @xmath1 , @xmath80 , the set @xmath81 is a simple curve connecting two boundary points of @xmath42 .",

    "thus , it is enough to show that no such @xmath89 exists .",
    "if @xmath89 lies in the interior of a disk @xmath72 , then it can not be locally extreme , because in such a region @xmath43 is defined as the @xmath1-coordinate of the points in a planar embedding of @xmath72 . if @xmath89 lies in the interior of an edge , then it can not be locally extreme either , since restricted to edges , @xmath43 is a strictly monotone function .",
    "we are left with the case when @xmath89 is a vertex of @xmath0 .",
    "if there is at least one edge incident to @xmath89 on both sides of @xmath89 , then we can argue in the same way as in the last case .",
    "the only remaining case is when @xmath89 is a vertex and all edges incident to @xmath89 are on one side of @xmath89 . to deal with this case , we need some preparation",

    "therefore , along such a path @xmath43 increases .",
