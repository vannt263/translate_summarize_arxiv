    "first we consider the deterministic dynamics of the system in a single site and we get the time behaviour of @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , by analyzing the stability of the ecosystem with different constant values of the interaction parameter @xmath0 , which correspond to a coexistence regime ( @xmath6 ) or to an exclusion regime ( @xmath7 ) .",
