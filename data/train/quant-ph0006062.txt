    "disturbance caused by an attempt to gain classical information about the quantum state of a physical system is one of the essential features of quantum theory @xcite .",
    "the balance between the information gain and the state disturbance can be quantified in many different ways , depending on a specific physical scenario .",
    "analytical derivations of the exact form of such trade - offs are usually a non - trivial matter , as the optimization needs to be carried out over all possible quantum operations that can be applied to the system . nevertheless , in certain instances , for example the case of estimation and operation fidelities for a single @xmath0-level system in a uniformly distributed pure state , optimization by analytical means has been shown to be possible @xcite .",
    "the derivation of this last result was enabled essentially by the fact that both the operation and the estimation fidelities are quadratic in the operators that constitute the stinespring decomposition of a quantum operation .",
    "the situation becomes considerably more involved when the parameters quantifying the state disturbance or the information gain have a more complicated dependence on the quantum operation .",
    "a good example is the gain of information expressed in terms of the shannon entropy .",
    "this quantity arises naturally in the framework of bayesian inference , when we try to quantify how well the _",
    "a posteriori _ probability distribution `` pins down '' the measured state @xcite . in this paper , we present a derivation of the trade - off between the information gain and state disturbance , when the physical system under consideration consists of a single qubit prepared in a pure state , and both the information gain and the state disturbance are quantified using parameters satisfying certain invariance criteria . as a concrete example , we will consider the trade - off between the shannon entropy as a measure of the information gain combined with the state disturbance quantified in terms of the average operation fidelity .    an intermediate step in this derivation requires demonstrating that it is sufficient to consider the so - called efficient @xcite ( also known as lders - type @xcite or ideal @xcite ) operations , for which obtaining a specific measurement outcome leaves the system in a pure state",
    ". physically speaking , efficient quantum operations should introduce minimum disturbance while inducing a fixed generalized measurement , or equivalently , maximize the amount of classical information for a given stinespring decomposition of a quantum operation . while the latter property is straightforward to prove for the shannon information gain or the average estimation fidelity , the former property in the case of the operation fidelity has been conjectured a while ago by barnum @xcite , and proven by him only recently @xcite using the convexity of certain operator maps involving tensor products @xcite .",
    "we show here that in the case of uniform distributions generating unitarily invariant measures of the state disturbance , the optimality of efficient operations can be analyzed following an alternative route , based on results obtained in the field of convex analysis on operators @xcite .",
    "this connection is valid for arbitrary finite - dimensional systems , and it is an interesting question whether any of these results can be carried over to hilbert spaces of inifinite dimension .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "first we discuss the convexity properties of measures characterizing information gain and state disturbance in sect .  2 and 3 using the examples of the shannon information gain and the operation fidelity . in sect",
    "3 we also link the optimality of efficient quantum operations to the convexity of unitarily invariant functions defined on hermitian operators . in sect .",
    "4 we derive the trade - off between the information gain and the state disturbance for a single qubit .",
    "5 gives two other measures of information gain and state disturbance which fall under the general formalism used in the preceding section .",
    "finally , sect .",
    "6 concludes the paper .",
    "before we pass on to detailed discussion , let us first summarize briefly the elementary facts needed further in this paper .",
    "the subject of our interest is a quantum operation , i.e.  a trace - preserving completely positive map acting on density operators @xmath1 .",
    "the map has the stinespring decomposition of the form @xmath2 with the family of the operators @xmath3 satisfying the condition @xmath4 which guarantees the preservation of the trace of the density operator .",
    "we assume that the index @xmath5 describes the classical outcome of the measurement , while the summation over the index @xmath6 is responsible for additional averaging due to the imperfections of the measuring apparatus , resulting in a decrease of classically available information .",
    "if we are interested only in the classical outcome of the measurement , then it is sufficient to consider a positive operator - valued measure @xmath7 induced by the quantum operation @xmath8 according to @xmath9 the probability of obtaining a specific result @xmath5 is given by @xmath10 , and the outcome @xmath5 is associated with a conditional transformation of the density matrix given by @xmath11 the gain of classical information depends only on the operator - valued measure @xmath7 , whereas the state disturbance is affected by the specific form of the quantum operation .",
    "of course , there are many quantum operations corresponding to a given operator - valued measure @xmath7 . given an operation @xmath12 we can always augment the associated information gain by assuming that both the indices @xmath5 and @xmath6 are available classically .",
    "conversely , we can ask which quantum operation inducing the generalized measurement @xmath7 minimizes the state disturbance . a good candidate for this operation",
    "is @xmath13 , as it retains the purity of the input state for a given measurement outcome , and also preserves the relative phases of the input state in the basis diagonalizing @xmath14 . as it will be discussed in sect .  3",
    ", this intuition turns out to be correct when the measure of the state disturbance can be represented as a sum of contributions given by the values of a certain function on the operators @xmath15 , when this function is unitarily invariant and concave on the subspace of diagonal operators .",
    "as an example of a measure of classical information gained from a quantum operation , we shall consider here the decrease of the shannon entropy between the _ a priori _ and _ a posteriori _ probability distributions defined on the manifold of pure states .",
    "let us denote by @xmath16 the normalized invariant integration measure on the manifold of pure states .",
    "this measure is induced by the haar measure associated with the lie group of unitary transformations on the corresponding hilbert space .",
    "we will assume that the initial _ a priori _ probability distribution is given with respect to this measure by a function @xmath17 .",
    "therefore the initial entropy is given by the expression @xmath18 = -\\int\\text{d}\\psi \\ , p(\\psi ) \\log_{2 } p(\\psi).\\ ] ] obtaining a specific outcome @xmath5 of the measurement yields a conditional _ a posteriori _ probability distribution @xmath19 calculated according to the bayes rule as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the standard quantum mechanical probability of obtaining the outcome @xmath5 for an input state @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the average : @xmath24 the shannon entropy of the conditional _ a posteriori _",
    "distribution @xmath19 is given by the expression @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "as we are interested in the average decrease of the entropy after the quantum operation is carried out , we need to take the difference @xmath26 - h[p(\\psi | r)]$ ] and average it over all possible outcomes of the experiment with the probability distribution @xmath23 .",
    "thus the final expression for the average gain of the shannon information @xmath27 from a measurement described by a positive operator - valued measure @xmath28 is given by : @xmath29 - h[p(\\psi | r)]\\ } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\sum_{r } \\int \\text{d}\\psi \\ , p(r|\\psi)p(\\psi ) \\log_2",

    "\\psi \\rangle}{\\int \\text{d}\\psi \\ , p(\\psi ) \\langle \\psi | \\hat{m}_r | \\psi \\rangle}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the following , it will be convenient to represent the average information gain as a sum @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a function defined for semipositive operators",
    "@xmath32 according to : @xmath33 let us note that @xmath31 is positively homogeneous of degree one .    physically , we anticipate that combining two elements @xmath34 and @xmath35 of the operator measure into one operator @xmath36 should result in the loss of information .",
    "such a loss of information should correspond to the inequality @xmath37 which is equivalent to the convexity of @xmath31 due to the fact that @xmath31 positively homogeneous of degree one .",
    "the above inequality is a general property of mutual information @xcite , and it follows elementarily from the convexity of the function @xmath38 on the interval @xmath39 $ ] : @xmath40 \\log_2 [ t x_1 + ( 1-t ) x_2]\\ ] ] inserting @xmath41 yields the convexity of the integrand in ( [ eq : hhatm ] ) , and integrating it with @xmath42 proves the convexity of @xmath43 . by mathematical induction",
    ", we therefore obtain that for a quantum operation @xmath8 the information gain is maximized by assuming that both the indices @xmath44 are available classically , and by constructing a `` finer '' generalized measurement from the quantum operation as @xmath45 .",
    "an analogous statement holds also for any other measure of information gain which is decomposable to the form ( [ eq : h = sum ] ) with a positively homogeneous convex function @xmath43 .",
    "if the initial state @xmath22 of the system is chosen according to a probability distribution @xmath17 , then the operation fidelity @xmath46 for a quantum operation @xmath8 , defined as the average projection of the final density matrix onto the initial pure state , is given by the expression : @xmath47 for a uniform distribution of input states with @xmath48 the integral @xmath49 can be carried out analytically in a @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space @xcite , yielding the following expression for the mean operation fidelity @xcite : @xmath50.\\ ] ] by applying the singular value decomposition to operators @xmath51 , it can be shown by elementary means that @xmath52 , and consequently the operation fidelity can only increase when replacing @xmath51 with @xmath53 , while the generalized measurement induced by the operation ( and consequently any measure of the information gain ) remain the same .",
    "this implies that it is sufficient to restrict our considerations to quantum operations composed of semipositive definite hermitian operators @xmath51 . in this case",
    ", we can represent the operation fidelity as a sum over @xmath44 of a certain function @xmath54 of the products @xmath15 : @xmath55 the function @xmath56 , given explicitly by : @xmath57 is well defined for all semipositive hermitian operators @xmath32 , which form a convex set .",
    "let us note that similarly to the function @xmath31 introduced in the preceding section it is also positively homogeneous of degree one .",
    "we would like now to find a quantum operation which maximizes the mean operation fidelity under the constraint of inducing a specified operator - valued measure according to ( [ eq : mr= ] ) .",
    "recalling the introductory discussion , we expect that the optimal operation is given by square roots of the operator measure @xmath13 . in order to obtain this result , it is sufficient to show that for any semipositive definite operators @xmath34 and @xmath35 the function @xmath56 satisfies the following inequality : @xmath58 which again is equivalent to its concavity , as @xmath56 is positively homogeneous . assuming that ( [ eq : fconcave ] ) holds , we would immediately obtain that for any two elements @xmath59 and @xmath60 of a quantum operation we have : @xmath61 , and by induction : @xmath62 which would prove our thesis .    in order to demonstrate ( [ eq : fconcave ] ) ,",
    "let us first note that @xmath54 is invariant with respect to unitary transformations of its argument , i.e.@xmath63 for any semipositive @xmath32 and unitary @xmath64 .",
    "therefore @xmath56 can depend only on the eigenvalues of @xmath32 .",
    "let us consider a function @xmath65 defined on @xmath0-dimensional vectors @xmath66 with nonnegative coordinates , given by the value of @xmath54 on a diagonal operator @xmath67 : @xmath68 in the case of @xmath54 given by ( [ eq : fexplicit ] ) , the function @xmath65 reads : @xmath69 and it is symmetric , i.e.  invariant with respect to the permutations of the coordinates @xmath70 of the vector @xmath71 .",
    "it is easy to verify that for any pair @xmath72 the following inequality holds : @xmath73 which analogously as before means that @xmath65 is concave due to its positive homogeneity . indeed , by writing explicitly the left and the right hand sides of the above inequality we have : @xmath74 and it is straightforward to see that the inequality holds separately for every term with fixed @xmath75 and @xmath76 , which proves ( [ eq : phiconcave ] ) .",
    "the inequality ( [ eq : phiconcave ] ) immediately implies the inequality ( [ eq : fconcave ] ) for pairs of operators @xmath34 and @xmath35 which commute and therefore can be diagonalized simultaneously in the same orthonormal basis .    the definition ( [ eq : phidef ] ) introduces a correspondence between a unitarily invariant function @xmath54 and a function @xmath65 which is symmetric , i.e.   invariant with respect to the permutations of the coordinates of its argument .",
    "the crucial step of the reasoning is the application of a theorem proven first by davies @xcite and by friedland @xcite stating that in this setting the convexity ( concavity ) of @xmath54 is equivalent to the convexity ( concavity ) of @xmath65 on their respective domains .",
    "hence ( [ eq : phiconcave ] ) implies the inequality ( [ eq : fconcave ] ) also for non - commuting pairs of operators @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this immediately proves that for a given generalized measurement @xmath77 the quantum operation minimizing the state disturbance quantified with the mean operation fidelity is given by @xmath78 in the case of a uniform distribution on pure input states .",
    "the results described in the preceding sections allow us to restrict the search for the information gain versus state disturbance trade - off to efficient quantum operations generated from positive operator - valued measures @xmath7 by taking the square roots of its elements @xmath79 .",
    "furthermore , we will consider @xmath54 and @xmath43 which are respectively concave and convex unitarily invariant functions with the property of positive homogeneity .",
    "for a single qubit , these assumptions severely restrict the number of parameters characterizing the elements @xmath14 of the operator - valued measure which play a non - trivial role in the derivation .",
    "in fact , as we will see in a moment , the only relevant parameter is the ratio of the eigenvalues of @xmath14 .",
    "let us start by using the positive homogeneity of @xmath54 and @xmath43 to write : @xmath80 and denote @xmath81 .",
    "of course @xmath82 , and taking the trace of @xmath83 yields a summation condition on @xmath84 : @xmath85 next , let us denote the eigenvalues of the renormalized operators @xmath86 as : @xmath87 the positivity of the eigenvalues requires that @xmath88 , and if we further assume with no loss of generality that the eigenvalues are arranged in a non - increasing order , we can restrict our interest to the range @xmath89 . in the new variables we can now write : @xmath90 where the functions @xmath91 \\rightarrow \\mathbbm{r}$ ] are defined as : @xmath92 it is straightforward to show that the concavity of @xmath54 and the convexity of @xmath43 together with their positive homogeneity imply that the functions @xmath93 and @xmath94 are respectively concave and convex . furthermore , the converse is also true .",
    "physically , we expect that @xmath93 is strictly decreasing , whereas @xmath94 is strictly increasing on their domain @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "the reason for this is that the parameter @xmath95 characterizes the imbalance between the eigenvalues of @xmath14 for a fixed trace @xmath96 , and balanced pairs of eigenvalues do not disturb the state , whereas unbalanced pairs of eigenvalues are responsible for the information gain .",
    "if we now assume that the function @xmath93 is strictly monotonic , then the information gain @xmath27 can be expressed as : @xmath97 let us now recall the notion of a concave envelope @xcite of a real function @xmath98 defined on a convex set @xmath99 .",
    "the concave envelope , which we will denote by @xmath100 is defined as a concave function such that @xmath101 for all @xmath102 , and also that for any other concave function @xmath103 satisfying @xmath104 everywhere we have also @xmath105 everywhere on @xmath99 . in the one - dimensional case",
    "the concave envelope is given explicitly by the expression @xmath106 in our derivation , we will take @xmath107 , and @xmath108 in the above formula are any two points from the image of @xmath93 .",
    "the concave envelope @xmath109 can be used to estimate @xmath27 in ( [ eq : h = hof-1 ] ) from above , and furthermore the concavity of @xmath110 allows us to apply jensen s inequality . combining these two steps yields : @xmath111",
    "thus finally @xmath112 where @xmath113 is defined according to ( [ eq : convexenvelope ] ) .",
    "let us note that in general the concavity of @xmath93 and the convexity of @xmath94 along with their monotonicity do not guarantee automatically that the composition @xmath114 is concave itself , hence the need to take its concave envelope .",
    "this can be seen most easily when both @xmath93 and @xmath94 are doubly differentiable on @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "then we have : @xmath115 and the conditions @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath119 do not imply a well - defined sign of the right - hand side of the above formula",
    ".    the inequality ( [ eq : tradeoff ] ) can be easily saturated .",
    "if we take a two - element quantum operation of the form @xmath120 with @xmath121 , we can generate any point of the graph of the function @xmath114 .",
    "furthermore , by taking suitable combinations of two quantum operations that have the above form @xmath122 with @xmath123 we can generate an arbitrary point of the graph of the function @xmath113 , which follows from ( [ eq : convexenvelope ] ) .",
    "let us also note that if the composition @xmath114 is a strictly concave function , then the equality sign in ( [ eq : tradeoff ] ) is reached if and only if the parameters @xmath124 are equal .",
    "this means that for a strictly concave @xmath114 all the elements of an operator valued measure saturating the trade - off need to have the same ratio of their eigenvalues .",
    "let us now specialize the above result to the trade - off expressed in terms of the operation fidelity versus the shannon information gain . in the case of the average operation fidelity ,",
    "the function @xmath93 defined in ( [ eq : fdef ] ) has the following explicit form : @xmath125 furthermore , as sketched in appendix  a , it is straightforward to obtain a closed expression for the shannon information : @xmath126 which is a particular case of the general result obtained by jones @xcite . in the case of @xmath93 and @xmath94 given by ( [ eq : f(x)opfidelity ] ) and ( [ eq : h(x)shannon ] )",
    "the composition @xmath114 is strictly concave on the whole image of @xmath93 , which is also shown in appendix  a. consequently , inverting the function @xmath93 given in ( [ eq : f(x)opfidelity ] ) brings the trade - off inequality : @xmath127 with @xmath94 given by ( [ eq : h(x)shannon ] ) . as the right - hand side is strictly concave over the domain of @xmath46 , jensen s inequality is saturated only for operations for which all @xmath124 are equal .",
    "this means that the ratio of the eigenvalues for all the elements of the operator measure @xmath28 needs to be constant across the index @xmath5 .",
    "in order to illustrate the generality of the derivation presented in the preceding section , let us discuss two other measures of information gain and state disturbance for which the above reasoning leading to the trade - off for a single qubit holds as well .",
    "as an example of another measure of the information gain satisfying all the above properties let us recall the example of the mean estimation fidelity @xcite for which the trade - off against the operation fidelity has been studied in @xcite . using the notation of the present paper we can write the estimation fidelity for a uniform input distribution in @xmath0 dimensions as a sum @xmath128 of terms given by : @xmath129\\ ] ] where @xmath130 stands for the standard euclidean operator norm . the above function",
    "again is positively homogeneous and convex : @xmath131 the latter property following immediately from the lower bound on the second term in ( [ eq : gexplicit ] ) for a sum of two semipositive definite hermitian operators @xmath34 and @xmath35 : @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the eigenvector of @xmath134 corresponding to its largest eigenvalue .",
    "specialized to the qubit system , @xmath135 induces the function @xmath136 : @xmath137    as an alternative measure of the state disturbance we will consider the absolute value of the scalar product between the input and the output state , and its generalization to density matrices @xcite . in this paper we will call it the bures - uhlmann fidelity in order to distinguish it from the fidelity discussed in sect .  3 , which is a square of the former @xcite .",
    "for a distribution on pure input states characterized by a probability distribution @xmath17 , the average bures - uhlmann fidelity is given by @xmath138 the demonstration that quantum operations composed of semipositive definite hermitian operators optimize the bures - uhlmann fidelity turns out to be substantially more complicated than in the case of @xmath46 .",
    "the particular case of a single qubit with @xmath48 is discussed in appendix  b. if we restrict our attention to quantum operations composed of hermitian and semipositive definite operators @xmath139 , we can write @xmath140 as a sum : @xmath141 where the function @xmath142 is defined on hermitian semipositive operators by the equation : @xmath143 the function @xmath142 is positively homogeneous , and it is also concave for commuting operators @xmath34 and @xmath35 . in order to show this , let us introduce an orthonormal basis @xmath144 in which both the operators are diagonal : @xmath145 and @xmath146 , and denote @xmath147 , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 as four independent nonnegative numbers , it is straightforward to show that @xmath150 this inequality , summed over @xmath75 with the weights @xmath151 yields : @xmath152 which integrated over pure states with @xmath153 implies that for any two commuting operators @xmath34 and @xmath35 we have : @xmath154 furthermore , if @xmath48 then @xmath142 is unitarily invariant , and we can again use davies result to show that @xmath142 is concave for all , not necessarily commuting , pairs of semipositive hermitian operators .",
    "the above result means in particular that for a qubit prepared in a uniformly distributed pure state efficient operations composed of hermitian semipositive elements are optimal from the point of view of the trade - off . in this case",
