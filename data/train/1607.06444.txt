    "there is no need to consider their equality gadget as we can simply replace it by two inequalities .",
    "[ fig:3clausegadget ] is a simplified version of mulzer s gadget for a clause with three literals , again with the cycle through the clauses .",
    "we removed some of the variables as we do not aim at a rectilinear drawing of the graph .",
    "additionally , we replaced the equality gadget by two inequalities .",
    "if some of the input variables are negated , we can simply add another variable - vertex and an inequality gadget .",
    "the four clauses in the inequality gadget can obviously be included on the cycle by a short detour .",
    "finally , we have to consider clauses that consist of only two literals .",
    "the corresponding construction of mulzer and rote did not allow us to add a cycle through the clauses .",
    "therefore , we use a new gadget ; see fig .",
    "[ fig:2clausegadget ] .",
    "clearly , we can again add inequality gadgets to negate the input variables .",
    "we show that the clause in this gadget is satisfiable iff @xmath548 holds : if both @xmath107 and @xmath108 are false , @xmath270 and @xmath139 are true and hence more than one variable in the clause is true .",
    "if @xmath107 and @xmath108 are true , @xmath270 and @xmath139 are false and the clause can be fulfilled by setting @xmath269 to true . if @xmath107 and @xmath108 have distinct truth values , @xmath270 and @xmath139 also have distinct truth values and thus the clause can be fulfilled by setting @xmath269 to false .         if a graph containing the intersection line gadget can be embedded on two non - parallel planes , the vertices @xmath292 , @xmath293 , and @xmath294 must be drawn on the intersection line of the two planes while the vertices @xmath287 , @xmath288 , @xmath289 , and @xmath290 can not lie on the intersection line .    for a contradiction , assume that the middle vertex @xmath293 is not drawn on this intersection line , but in another position on plane @xmath159 .",
    "this implies that its whole neighborhood @xmath549 , which consists of all other vertices of the gadget , has to be placed on @xmath159 , too .",
    "but @xmath550 is a supergraph of @xmath551 and thus can not be drawn in one plane .",
    "hence , @xmath293 has to be drawn on the intersection line .",
    "now assume that @xmath292 lies on @xmath159 , but not on the intersection line .",
    "then , again , its neighborhood  including the vertices @xmath287 , @xmath288 , and @xmath289  is also drawn on @xmath159 . at most two of these vertices",
    "can be drawn on the intersection line because they are all neighbors of @xmath293 .",
    "therefore , one of them , say @xmath289 , lies on @xmath159 without the intersection line .",
    "as @xmath294 is a neighbor of @xmath289 , it is also placed on @xmath159 .",
    "again we draw a supergraph of @xmath551 on @xmath159 , a contradiction .    by applying a symmetric argument to  @xmath294",
    ", we can infer that @xmath292 , @xmath293 , and @xmath294 have to be drawn on the intersection line .",
    "since @xmath552 are adjacent to all of the three vertices , they clearly can not lie on the intersection line .",
    "we show np - hardness by reduction from 3-satand use the construction from lemma  [ lem : posplacyconenpc ] to get an equivalent instance @xmath43 of positive planar cycle 1-in-3-sat . by our construction",
    "we also get a cycle @xmath553 through the clause - vertices in @xmath43 and a planar combinatorial embedding of @xmath554 .",
    "this embedding gives us a partition of the vertices that are not part of @xmath250 : @xmath555 are the vertices that are placed inside of @xmath250 , and @xmath556 are the vertices that are placed outside of @xmath250 .",
    "we now draw @xmath557 on a straight line @xmath200 .",
    "we add a vertex @xmath292 above @xmath200 , and @xmath293 below @xmath200 .",
    "using tutte s theorem @xcite , we can draw @xmath555 in the polygon @xmath558 above @xmath200 with straight - line edges , and @xmath556 in the polygon @xmath559 below @xmath200 using straight - line edges . to be able to apply this theorem , we choose an arbitrary inner triangulation of each of the partitions .",
    "this yields the straight - line drawing @xmath144 of @xmath560 .",
    "we build the graph @xmath296 as follows : each clause @xmath139 is represented by a clause gadget that consists of three vertices @xmath297 , @xmath298 , and @xmath299 that are connected by a path .",
    "let @xmath107 be a variable that occurs in the clauses @xmath300 with @xmath301 .",
    "each variable @xmath107 is represented by a tree with the vertices @xmath302 that are connected to the relevant clauses , and the vertices @xmath303 that lie on a path and are connected to these vertices .",
    "to each of the vertices @xmath303 one instance of the intersection line gadget is connected . finally , we add a blocking caterpillar that consists of the vertices @xmath304 and connects the clauses in the cyclic order of @xmath250 .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : rho - np - graph - construction ] for an example for this construction .",
    "first , assume that the formula @xmath43 has a 1-in-3-satassignment , that is , an assignment where exactly one variable is true in each clause .",
    "then we can draw it onto two intersecting planes @xmath561 , @xmath562 in the following way : we place the clause - vertices on the intersection line of the two planes in the order given by the cycle @xmath250 .",
    "this intersection line splits each of the two planes into two half - planes .    on the plane @xmath561",
    "we place the variable - vertices that are set to true and the edges connecting to the clause - vertices ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : rho - np - true ] .",
    "obviously , we can draw the edges without crossings , because our 1-in-3-sat instance is planar and each clause is connected to only one variable .",
    "we remark that the variables are possibly placed on both half - planes of @xmath561 , but we use an embedding where each variable is fixed to only one half - plane . since the true variables cover only one side of each clause gadget , we can attach the corresponding vertex of the blocking caterpillar to the other side .",
    "note that the path connecting the vertices @xmath563 can cross the intersection line between the clause gadgets because all the edges incident to variable - vertices of one variable stay inside one of the half - planes .",
    "on the plane @xmath562 we place the false variables vertices ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : rho - np - false ] .",
    "each clause contains exactly two false variables , which we obviously have to place on different half - planes .",
    "if both variables are on the same side of the cycle @xmath250 in the given planar embedding @xmath144 , we draw one of the vertices @xmath564 onto the other side .",
    "since we have only two variables per clause , we can draw the edge @xmath565 , which connects the two half - planes , directly alongside the clause gadget without destroying planarity .    for the other direction",
    ", we assume that we are given a drawing of @xmath305 onto two planes .",
    "lemma  [ lem : intersectionlinegadget ] shows that the clause - vertices lie on the intersection line of the two planes , while the variable - vertices and the blocking caterpillar can not lie on the intersection line .",
    "the vertices of each variable completely lie on one plane : since they are connected , one of them had to be placed on the intersection line otherwise to prevent edges running outside of the planes . similarly the blocking caterpillar is only on one of the planes ; we call this plane @xmath561 , the other one @xmath562 .    to get a 1-in-3-satassignment for @xmath43 , we now set the variables that are drawn on @xmath561 to true and those on @xmath562 to false .",
    "obviously every clause gadget can have at most one neighbor in each of the four half - planes .",
    "since each clause is adjacent to a vertex of the blocking caterpillar in one of the half - planes of @xmath561 , it is connected to at most one variable in @xmath561 ; that is , each clause contains at most one true variable . on the other hand ,",
    "only two variables of the clause can be drawn on @xmath562 , so there are at most two false variables in each clause .",
    "together this yields that there is exactly one true variable in each clause and thus we constructed a feasible 1-in-3-satassignment for @xmath43 .",
