    "investigations of hard exclusive processes are essential for our understanding of the internal quark - gluon dynamics of hadrons .",
    "theoretically , such studies are based on the assumption of factorization of dynamics at long and short distances .",
    "the short - distance physics is well elaborated by perturbative methods of qcd and depends on particular hard subprocesses .",
    "the long - distance dynamics is essentially nonperturbative and within the factorization formalism becomes parametrized in terms of hadronic _ distribution amplitudes _",
    "these nonperturbative quantities are universal and are defined as vacuum - to - hadron matrix elements of particular nonlocal light - cone quark or quark - gluon operators .",
    "the evolution of das at sufficiently large virtuality @xmath1 is controlled by the renormalization scale dependence of the quark bilinear operators within the qcd perturbation theory . for leading - order das",
    "this dependence is governed by qcd evolution equations .",
    "when the normalization scale goes to infinity the das reach an ultraviolet fixed point and are uniquely determined by perturbative qcd .",
    "however , the derivation of the das themselves at an initial scale @xmath2 from first principles is a nonperturbative problem and remains a serious challenge .",
    "here we present the results @xcite of study of the pion , @xmath3-meson and photon das in the leading and higher twists at a low - momentum renormalization scale in the gauged non - local chiral quark model @xcite based on the instanton picture of qcd vacuum .",
    "the distribution amplitudes of the mesons or the photon are defined via the matrix elements of quark - antiquark bilinear operators taken between the vacuum and the hadronic state @xmath4 of momentum @xmath5 .",
    "it is assumed that the quark and antiquark are separated by the distance @xmath6 and the light - like limit @xmath7 is taken at a fixed scalar product @xmath8 .",

    "the twist-3 and twist-4 das have been found respectively in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the photon das up to twist-4 expansion have been found in @xcite .",
    "recently there have been published some papers @xcite where in nonlocal models similar to considered above the distribution functions for pion and photon were treated inconsistently .",
    "indeed , the typical expression ( [ phda ] ) defining the distribution functions has two parts .",
    "one is coming from soft hadronic vertices ( [ vert1 ] ) and another refers to the operators of definite twist which are responsible for the power corrections in the hard subprocess .",
    "it is well known that , for example , the leading twist operators entering the pion distribution amplitude and distribution function are given by @xmath50 and @xmath51 , correspondingly .",
    "nevertheless , the authors of @xcite included additional terms proportional to @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are incoming and outgoing momenta of a quark .",
    "these additions in @xcite modify the known results of the leading twist calculations .",
    "however , it is evident , see for example @xcite , that these additional terms contribute to twist-4 distributions and do not touch the leading twist-2 distributions . from the other side ,",
    "the full vertex including the local and nonlocal pieces is important in the soft hadronic part and has not to be neglected as it was done in @xcite considering the photon distribution amplitudes .",
    "the instanton model of qcd vacuum is realistic tool to get nonperturbative properties of hadrons in terms of parameters characterizing the vacuum .",
    "all hadron das are suppressed at the bound of kinematical interval due to localized wave function of hadrons , while photon das are not zero there . by applying the qcd evolution",
    "the photon das become immediately zero at the edge points of @xmath19-interval .",
    "nevertheless , the photon das are always wider than asymptotic distribution .",
    "the first experimental results on direct measurements of pion and photon das are discussed in aitala:2000hc , ukleja:2004yt .",
