    "the measurement of the total cross section for electron positron annihilation into hadrons allows for a unique test of pertubative qcd .",
    "the decay rate @xmath4 provides one of the most precise determinations of the strong coupling constant @xmath5 . in the high energy limit",
    "the quark masses can often be neglected . in this approximation",
    "qcd corrections to @xmath6 have been calculated up to order @xmath7 @xcite . for precision measurements the dominant mass corrections",
    "must be included through an expansion in @xmath8 .",
    "terms up to order @xmath9 @xcite and @xmath10 @xcite are available at present , providing an acceptable approximation from the high energy region down to intermediate energy values . for a number of measurements , however , the information on the complete mass dependence is desirable .",
    "this includes charm and bottom meson production above the resonance region , say above @xmath11  gev and @xmath12  gev , respectively , and , of course , top quark production at a future electron positron collider .    to order @xmath5 this calculation",
    "was performed by klln and sabry in the context of qed a long time ago @xcite . with measurements of ever increasing precision , predictions in order @xmath1 are needed for a reliable comparison between theory and experiment .",
    "furthermore , when one tries to apply the @xmath13 result to qcd , with its running coupling constant , the choice of scale becomes important .",
    "in fact , the distinction between the two intrinsically different scales , the relative momentum versus the center of mass energy , is crucial for a stable numerical prediction .",
    "this information can be obtained from a full calculation to order @xmath1 only .",
    "such a calculation then allows to predict the cross section in the complete energy region where perturbative qcd can be applied  from close to threshold up to high energies .    in this",
    "paper results for the cross section are presented in order @xmath1 .",
    "they are obtained from the vacuum polarisation @xmath0 which is calculated up to three loops . the imaginary part of the `` fermionic contribution ''  derived from diagrams with a massless quark loop inserted in the gluon propagator",
    " has been calculated in @xcite .",
    "all integrals could be performed to the end and the result was expressed in terms of polylogarithms . in this paper",
    "the calculation is extended to the full set of diagrams relevant for qcd . instead of trying to perform the integrals analytically",
    ", we use the large @xmath14 behaviour of @xmath0 up to terms of order @xmath15 and calculate its taylor series around @xmath16 up to terms of order @xmath17 .",
    "the leading and next - to - leading singularity is deduced from the known behaviour of the nonrelativistic green function and the two - loop qcd potential .",
    "altogether eight constraints on @xmath0 are thus available , four from @xmath16 , two from @xmath18 and two from the threshold .",
    "the contributions @xmath19 and @xmath20 have to be treated separately since they differ significantly in their singularity structure . for each of the three functions an interpolation",
    "is constructed which incorporates all data and is based on conformal mapping and pad approximation suggested in @xcite .",
    "since the result for @xmath21 is available in closed form the approximation method can be tested and shown to give excellent result for this case .",
    "reliable predictions for @xmath22 to order @xmath1 and arbitrary @xmath8 are thus available .    in this paper only results without renormalization group improvement and resummation of the coulomb singularities from higher orders are presented .",
    "resummation of leading higher order terms , phenomenological applications and a more detailed discussion of our methods will be presented elsewhere .",
    "a large number of ingredients are needed in the calculation of the three - loop vacuum polarisation function : the high energy behaviour of @xmath0 , its taylor series at @xmath16 and its singularities at threshold which are related to the qcd potential .",
    "the decomposition of @xmath23 according to its colour structure and the separation of gluonic and fermionic contributions is crucial to display the striking differences in the threshold region .",
    "the approximation method is based on conformal mapping and pad approximation . in the present approach both",
    "real and imaginary parts of the vacuum polarization @xmath0 are calculated and its analyticity properties are exploited heavily .    the physical observable @xmath24 is related to @xmath0 by @xmath25 it is convenient to define @xmath26 with the @xmath27 coupling @xmath28 defined in the conventional way .    to describe the singularity structure of @xmath23 in the region close to threshold the perturbative qcd potential @xcite @xmath29\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] will become important .",

    "we are only concerned with contributions to @xmath0 and @xmath24 which originate from diagrams where the electromagnetic current couples to the massive quark . in order @xmath5 and",
    "@xmath1 all these amplitudes are proportional to @xmath39 , the square of the charge of the massive quark .",
    "diagrams where the electromagnetic current couples to a massless quark and the massive quark is produced through a virtual gluon have been calculated in @xcite and will not be discussed here .    for the @xmath1 calculation",
    "the following steps have been performed :    * decomposition according to the colour structure *    the contributions from diagrams with @xmath40 light or one massive internal fermion loop will be denoted by @xmath41 and @xmath42 with the group theoretical coefficients factored out .",
    "purely gluonic corrections are proportional to @xmath43 or @xmath30 .",
    "the former are the only contributions in an abelian theory , the latter are characteristic for the nonabelian aspects of qcd",
    ". it will be important in the subsequent discussion to treat these two classes separately , since they exhibit qualitatively different behaviour close to threshold .",
    "the following decomposition of @xmath0 ( and similarly for @xmath24 ) is therefore adopted throughout the paper @xmath44.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] all steps described below have been performed seperately for the first three contributions to @xmath45 . in fact , new information is only obtained for @xmath46 and @xmath47 since @xmath48 is known analytically already .",
    "the amplitude with a massive internal fermion exhibits a two particle cut with threshold at @xmath49 which has been calculated analytically @xcite .",
    "the contribution from a four particle cut with threshold at @xmath50 is given in terms of a two dimensional integral @xcite which can be solved easily numerically .",
    "the @xmath51 term will not be treated in this paper .",
    "* analysis of the high @xmath14 behaviour *    the high energy behaviour of @xmath23 provides important constraints on the complete answer . in the limit of small @xmath15 the constant term and the one proportional to @xmath15 ( modulated by powers of @xmath52 )",
    "have been calculated a long time ago @xcite .",
    "for the imaginary part even the @xmath53 terms are available @xcite .",
    "this provides an important test of the numerical results presented below .",
    "* threshold behaviour *    general arguments based on the influence of coulomb exchange close to threshold , combined with the information on the perturbative qcd potential and the running of @xmath5 dictate the singularities and the structure of the leading cuts close to threshold , that is for small @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath43 term is directly related to the qed result with internal photon lines only .",
    "the leading @xmath55 singularity and the constant term of @xmath56 can be predicted from the nonrelativistic greens function for the coulomb potential and the @xmath57 calculation .",
    "the next - to - leading term is determined by the combination of one loop results again with the coulomb singularities @xcite .",
    "one finds @xmath58    the contributions @xmath59 and @xmath20 can be treated in parallel .",
    "the leading @xmath60 and @xmath21 term in @xmath22 is proportional to @xmath61 and is responsible for the evolution of the coupling constant close to threshold . also the constant term can be predicted by the observation , that the leading term in order @xmath5 is induced by the potential .",
    "the @xmath57 result @xmath62 is employed to predict the logarithmic and constant @xmath63 and @xmath64 terms of @xmath65 by replacing @xmath5 by @xmath66 as given in eq.([alphav ] ) .",
    "this implies the following threshold behaviour : @xmath67    this ansatz can be verified for the @xmath21 term since in this case the result is known in analytical form @xcite .",
    "extending the ansatz from the behaviour of the imaginary part close to the branching point into the complex plane allows to predict the leading term of @xmath0 @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "* behaviour at @xmath16 *    important information is contained in the taylor series of @xmath0 around zero .",
    "the calculation of the first four nontrivial terms is based on the evaluation of three - loop tadpole integrals with the help of the algebraic program matad written in form @xcite which performs the traces , calculates the derivatives with respect to the external momenta .",
    "it reduces the large number of different integrals to one master integral and a few simple ones through an elaborate set of recursion relations based on the integration - by - parts method @xcite .",
    "though this master integral , calculated in @xcite , appears in the result for single diagrams , in the final expession it cancels .",
    "the following results are obtained ( excluding the @xmath51 term ) : @xmath70 the @xmath43 terms in @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are in agreement with @xcite , the remaining ones are new .",
    "( note that the @xmath74 contribution calculated in @xcite were obtained with massive internal fermions . )    * conformal mapping and pad approximation *    the vacuum polarisation function @xmath45 is analytic in the complex plane cut from @xmath75 to @xmath76 .",
    "the taylor series in @xmath14 is thus convergent in the domain @xmath77 only .",
    "the conformal mapping which corresponds to the variable transformation @xmath78 transforms the cut complex @xmath14 plane into the interior of the unit circle .",
    "the special points @xmath79 correspond to @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "the upper ( lower ) part of the cut is mapped onto the upper ( lower ) perimeter of the circle .",
    "the taylor series in @xmath81 thus converges in the interior of the unit circle . to obtain predictions for @xmath0 at the boundary",
    "it has been suggested @xcite to use the pad approximation which converges towards @xmath0 even on the perimeter . to improve the accuracy the singular threshold behaviour and the large @xmath14 behaviour",
    "is incorporated into simple analytical functions which are removed from @xmath45 before the pad approximation is performed .",
    "the quality of this procedure can be tested by comparing the prediction with the known result for @xmath48 .",
    "the logarithmic singularities at threshold and large @xmath14 are removed by subtraction , the @xmath55 singularity , which is present for the @xmath43 terms only , by multiplication with @xmath82 as suggested in @xcite .",
    "the imaginary part of the remainder which is actually approximated by the pad method is thus smooth in the entire circle , numerically small and vanishes at @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "after performing the pad approximation for the smooth remainder with @xmath81 as natural variable , the transformation ( [ omega ] ) is inverted and the full vacuum polarisation function reconstructed by reintroducing the threshold and high energy terms .",
    "this procedure provides real and imaginary parts of @xmath45 .",
    "subsequently only the absorbtive part of @xmath45 ( multiplied by @xmath85 ) will be presented .    in figure [ figfull ]",
    "the complete results are shown for @xmath86 with @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 displayed separately .",
    "the solid curves are based on the @xmath90 $ ] , @xmath91 $ ] and @xmath91 $ ] pad approximants for @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively .",
    "the threshold and high energy behaviour is given by the dashed curves .",
    "the exact analytical result which is known for the @xmath89 contribution only differs from the approximation curve in figure [ figfull ] by less than the thickness of the line .",
    "the quality of the approximation for @xmath87 and @xmath88 is confirmed by the comparison of the high energy behaviour of the approximation with the known asymptotic behaviour ( figure [ fighigh ] ) .",
    "the quadratic approximation ( dash - dotted line ) is incorporated into @xmath95 by construction , the quartic approximation shown ( dashed line ) is known from @xcite , but is evidently very well recovered by the method presented here .",
    "different pad approximations of the same degree ( @xmath90 $ ] or @xmath96 $ ] ) and approximants with a reduced number of parameters give rise to practically indentical predictions , which could hardly be distinguished in figures [ figfull ] and [ fighigh ] .",
    "minor variations are observed close to threshold , _",
    "after _ subtracting the singular and constant parts .",
    "the remainder @xmath97 for three different pad approximants is shown in figure [ figthr ] .",
    "the stability of the different approximations and their smooth behaviour close to the point @xmath98 can be considered as additional confirmation of our ansatz in eqs.([ra],[rna],[rnl ] ) .",
    "the spread of the different curves can be used to estimate the quality of the approximation .",
    "for @xmath89 the approximation can be compared to the exact result ( dotted line ) and the nearly perfect agreement gives additional support to the approach presented in this work .    to summarize : real and imaginary part of the vacuum polarisation function @xmath0 from a massive quark have been calculated up to three loops for qcd and qed .",
    "this result extends the classic calculations of kllen and sabri @xcite to next - to - leading order .",
    "the imaginary part can be used to predict the cross section for production of massive quarks for arbitrary @xmath8 , wherever perturbative qcd can be justified  from above the quarkonium resonance region up to high energies .",
