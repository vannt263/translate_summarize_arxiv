    "our knowledge on how the solar corona is heated and maintained at a million degrees kelvin , when the photosphere below is at 5800 kelvin , is still far from being comprehensive .",
    "active regions ( ars ) are ideal observing targets to probe the underlying heating mechanisms as they are the locations of profound heating processes . in addition , they show a wide distribution of physical parameters .",
    "accurate measurements of such parameters are critical in the formulation and constraint of coronal heating theories . for extended discussions on coronal heating , refer to , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "topologically , ars possess different structures like the core loops primarily seen at @xmath1 3 - 5 mk rooted in moss regions which are seen primarily at around 1 - 2 mk ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , warm loops at @xmath1 1 mk @xcite , the cool fan structures at the edges of the ars at @xmath2 1 mk @xcite .",
    "in addition to the visible loop structures , there is a substantial amount of diffuse emission in and around the active regions @xcite .",
    "diffuse emission regions may be defined as regions with no resolvable structures .",
    "they may , however , appear to be loop - like structures at higher resolution .",
    "in fact , the emissions from confined loops structures are just about 20 - 30% higher than the background / foreground diffuse emission @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated the density and temperature structure of a limb ar .",
    "the authors reported that ar plasmas are multi - thermal and the electron densities fall off as a function of distance from the core , as was also obtained using the white light observations of the corona .",
    "ar heating has often been debated between effectively steady heating ( high frequency nanoflares ) and impulsive heating ( low frequency nanoflares ) . in the former scenario ,",
    "the delay between heating events is smaller than the cooling / draining timescale of the plasma , leading to conditions that are similar to constant heating .",
    "impulsive heating , however , suggests that the delay between heating events is longer than the cooling / draining timescale of the plasma , i.e. the plasma gets some time to cool down before another heating event takes place .",
    "the properties of 1 mk warm loops seem to favor impulsive heating @xcite . however , the heating of core loops is a matter of strong debate @xcite .",
    "recent analysis suggest that active regions during the early part of their evolution seem to show an em distribution ( emd ) that is consistent with impulsive heating , while during the latter part of their evolution , the variability of the core becomes more gentle and the em distribution is more consistent with high - frequency nanoflare heating @xcite .",
    "the study of diffuse emission has not been explored in great detail .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to study and probe the heating mechanism in the diffuse part of active regions .",
    "direct observations of heating processes are not possible yet , as these events happen on scales much smaller than the resolvable limits with the available present day instrumentation @xcite .",
    "emission measure ( em ) diagnostics have been advocated ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to be one of the possible indirect modes of studying the heating mechanisms among others such as doppler shifts @xcite and the recently developed time lag analysis @xcite .    here",
    ", we have employed the technique of em to study the diffuse emission in active regions .",
    "in addition , we estimate the em(t ) distribution of topologically different regions in off limb _ ar 10939 _ and _ ar 10961 _ ,",
    "i.e. , warm and core loop structures and compare with the em(t ) of the diffuse emission regions with the aim to probe the thermal structure in diffuse regions and thereby their heating mechanisms .",
    "@xcite presented a revised radiometric calibration , due to the degradation of detector s response of the eis instrument over time , since the launch date of the hinode mission .",
    "the revised calibration has been accepted by the eis team and has been provided in the solarsoftware package . in the present work ,",
    "we have applied the revised calibration on intensities to obtain the em and compared with that obtained using the unrevised intensities .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows : in section  [ obs ] , we describe the data used in this study and the reduction procedures applied ; in section  [ db ] , we discuss about an instrumental effect , the diffraction bands that are observed in our datasets ; we describe our data analysis method and present our results in section  [ analysis ] followed by a summary and discussion in section  [ conc ] .",

    "the observing study of _ ar 10939 _ was a full spectral observation .",
    "similarly , _ ar 10961 _ was rastered with a 1   slit over an area of 256  @xmath6  256 , with 15  sec exposure at each position and with a step size of 1 .",
    "this observing sequence consisted of 17 spectral windows and out of which 11 spectral lines have been used in the current study .",
    "tables  [ eis_linelist_ar10939_1 ] @xmath7  [ eis_linelist_ar10961_1 ] show the list of the spectral lines used in this study , along with their wavelengths and peak formation temperatures .",
    "the peak formation temperatures were obtained from recent chianti ionization equilibrium calculations ( chianti v7.1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the data are reduced using the standard procedure _ _ eis_prep.pro _ _  and are corrected for eis slit , tilt and satellite orbital variation . using _ _",
    "_ , a single gaussian line fit is applied to the data to derive the intensity maps , except for the  268.99   ,  197.86   ,  188.22   ,  195.12   ,  203.83   ,  193.87   and  201.00    lines . in the latter cases ,",
    "multiple gaussian fitting is applied to subtract the blended line contributions .",
    "the  256    line is one of the eis core lines , with the lowest formation temperature available in the eis spectral range .",
    "however , especially in the case of active regions , the interpretation of this line gets complicated by blends with  256.37   ,  256.41   and  256.42   @xcite .",
    "hence , we do not include the  256    line in this work .",
    "the rest of the available lines are very weak in the off - limb structures and hence could not be used .",
    "the  185.21     ( @xmath8 ) line is blended with the line which peaks in the ar core plasma and de - blending is essential to estimate the plasma parameters . in _ ar 10961 _ data , the respective line could not be de - blended because of the non availability of other line observations . while in the case of _ ar 10939 _ , de - blending is performed by estimating the contribution of to the line through observing the  195.27   line .",
    "disentangling the diffuse emission regions from the rest of the active region is a non - trivial task , which is very crucial for this work .",
    "hence it is essential to track the active region from the center of the sun to the limb , which may give some ideas regarding the evolution of different structures in the active region .",
    "the six images in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] display the intensity images of _ ar 10961 _ obtained in the line from 2007 aug 01 to 2007 aug 08 , tracking the evolution of the active region from disk center to the limb .",
    "the spectral line , whose peak formation temperature at @xmath9 , is the strongest fe line in the eis / hinode spectrum at ar conditions and the core structures that are primarily at few million degrees can be well studied at this temperature regime .",
    "thus by tracking the particular ar core at temperatures , the diffuse regions could be confidently constrained to be well outside the core structures .",
    "the intensity corrections required for the revised radiometric calibration were obtainied using _ eis_ltds.pro _",
    "( available in the ssw libraries ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which provides a factor by which the revised intensities differ with the unrevised ones .",
    "the revised intensities have been obtained by applying these correction factors to the initial intensities obtained from the data . from here",
    "onwards , we will be calling the initial intensities and the respective em distributions as unrevised intensities and unrevised emds .",
    "while the intensities corrected according to the revised radiometric calibration and the corresponding em distributions will be referred as revised intensities and revised emds .",
    "the reduced data of both the above mentioned off - limb active regions show diffraction bands ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) in the quiet regions beside the active regions .",
    "these bands are clearly seen in high temperature lines ( - ) , being most prominent in line ( fig.[fig5 ] ) .",
    "these are probably similar to the cross - shaped diffraction patterns seen in aia onboard sdo and trace during flares ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our cases , the scattered light forms bands rather than the crossed - spikes patterns .",
    "this is probably due to the active region being a broad structure of enhanced brightness at the off - limb when compared to the flaring regions ( young , p. , 2013 : private communication ) .",
    "the bands always trace the edges of the active regions and may arise due to the large intensity contrast produced by the active region over the off - limb background values .    for _ ar 10939 _ , intensity at the successive bands falls off approximately as 5% , 3% , 1% and 0.3% of the brightest part of the ar core ( @xmath10 39000   ergs @xmath11 s@xmath12 sr@xmath12 ) at distances of approximately 10 , 20 , 30 , and 40 .",
    "some of the observed emission at the locations of the bands comes from actual on - disk solar features , so these percentages represent upper limits on the diffracted core component .",
    "we use this information later to estimate the possible contamination in the diffuse emission above the limb .",
    "these factors mentioned above would depend on how big / bright the source is in that particular raster . while the _",
    "ar 10961 _ raster shows only a trace of such bands as the exposure time is much shorter ( 15  sec ) than the exposure time of the _ ar 10939 _ raster ( 26.5  sec ) . _",
    "ar 10961 _ data has another active region in the full field of view and it would be inappropriate to estimate the intensities of such bands as they have contamination from near - by structures .",
    "197@xmath13 , in order to help us in tracking any ar structure through the solar rotation .",
    "though all the ar data have been plotted with the same y - axis scale , the scalings in the x - axis are different .",
    "this is because the apparant heliographic longitude ( the solar x coordinate ) of the ar changes vastly over the solar rotation , unlike the latitude ( the solar y coordinate ) . ]",
    "the motivation behind this work is to probe the heating mechanism for the diffuse emission regions .",
    "off - limb ar data are ideal to spectroscopically study the topologically different areas within the active region , especially the diffuse emission regions , as these regions could be isolated without much contamination from the core of the active regions as well as warm 1 mk loops . a detailed description on the spectroscopic techniques for deriving the physical parameters like electron density and temperature along with the em of the emitting plasma has been given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "emd is a function of temperature and density of the emitting plasma .",
    "the observed intensity can be correlated with the emission measure as follows .",
    "@xmath14    where , @xmath15 is the elemental abundance and @xmath16 is the contribution function containing all the relevant atomic parameters like transition probabilities , ionization fraction etc .",
    "earlier works showed that , for ars , em obeys a power law @xmath17 up to a peak near 3 mk @xcite . while plotting the em with respect to temperature on a log - log scale , @xmath18 is the slope of a best fitted straight line up to the peak emission measure .",
    "the slope @xmath18 represents the temperature distribution of multi - thermal plasma along the line - of - sight .    for both the ars , _",
    "is used to choose a sample of topologically different areas within active regions like hot core loops , comparatively cooler warm loops and the diffuse emission regions , by masking pixels in polygon mode .",
    "it is crucial to make sure that each box contains only one type of feature , i.e. , they should not have any contamination from other regions .",
    "we have used _",
    "eis_mask_spectrum.pro _ to retrieve the spatially averaged spectra over each chosen pixel group ( box ) .",
    "abs(xx1[1:29 ] )        estimation of emission measure from averaged spectra is non trivial .",
    "as the masked regions are selected manually , the box sizes are not the same for all the regions .",
    "it is important to understand the effect of such varying box size in the estimation of em , in order to compare our results with the other similar works .",
    "hence , we choose a set of seven randomly oriented boxes each having a sub - box over _ ar 10961_. thus , in total there are 14 regions as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( left ) for the analysis and their respective em plots are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( right ) .",
    "the em plot clearly shows that choosing different boxes with different sizes , in a particular area in the field of view , does not vastly change the em .    the color scheme ( loadct , 5 ) , which we have chosen for images ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( left ) and fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] & [ fig4 ] ( top right ) ) , is found to be the best in representing the ar .",
    "the transition of color from blue to yellow distinctly represents the topologically different regions in the ar from the diffuse parts on the outskirts of the ar towards the core , respectively .",

    "we have divided these regions into different sets based on their locations .",
    "set 1 is comprised of the first four regions , namely m1 , m2 , m3 & m4 , which are selected in the diffuse emission region well above the ar core .",
    "set 2 is comprised of regions m5 , m6 , & m7 , which are located at the boundary between the core and the diffuse emission region .",

    "in addition , the peaks of the em curves for all the regions in set3 are at larger temperatures than those of set2 regions .",
    "the peak of the emission measure for set3 mostly lies at around @xmath25 .",
    "however , the em distribution for regions m10 and m11 in set3 ( plotted with triangles ) also shows a definite peak at @xmath0 which is characteristic of moss regions @xcite . in comparison , the em distribution of set2 peaks at a lower temperature of @xmath26 .",
    "the revised radiometric calibration broadens the peak of two ( m5 @xmath7 m6 ) out of the three masked regions choosen in this set , with the em decreasing more slowly with temperature in the range @xmath27 . while , the third one ( m7 ) which shows a double peak with the original calibration , namely at @xmath0 and @xmath28 , shows only the second peak at @xmath28 prominently with the revised calibration .",
    "we have studied the slopes of the em and hot to warm ratios for the regions in set2 and set3 .",
    "the ratio of hot to warm emission is determined by taking the ratio between the peak em and the em obtained at and .",
    "the slope , however , is obtained between the temperature corresponding to peak em and the em of at @xmath29 .",
    "the slope of unrevised em for sets  2 & 3 ranges between 2.3 @xmath7 4.2 and the ratios of hot to warm emission varies between 3.8 @xmath7 7.3 when warm emission is considered at @xmath29 .",
    "these ratios increase to the range between 9 @xmath7 28 when considering as warm emission .",
    "the revised calibration makes the slope comparatively shallower in the range of 1.5 @xmath7 3 , with the hot to emission varying between 2.8 @xmath7 5.4 , and the hot to varying between 8 @xmath7 24 .",
    "+   +   +   +    the left panels of row 2 @xmath7 3 in figure  [ fig3 ] show the emission measure distribution of diffuse regions classified as set1 , comprising m1 , m2 , m3 & m4 .",
    "both em distribution curves ( unrevised and revised ) for all four regions are strikingly similar and show a definite peak at @xmath0 , i.e. , at the peak formation temperature of , except that the peak of revised emds is broader at @xmath7 temperatures . for each of these curves ,",
    "the estimated value of emd slopes , @xmath18 , along with the emission measure ratio of the hot plasma to the warm plasma ( and ) are given in the table [ table_slope_emratio ] .",
    "the slopes are computed between @xmath0 and @xmath29 .",
    "the active region spectra for _ ar 10939 _ are full spectral scans , and the obtained emd provide a complete picture of the thermal structure of the regions .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the peak of the em distribution for diffuse regions lies at @xmath30 .",
    "the masked regions choosen in the sets 1 , 2 , and 3 ( m8@xmath7m9 ) are located approximately 50 `` , 25 '' , 10 \" from the brightest part of the core ( where set3 : m10@xmath7m11 fall ) .",
    "using the results of section 3 , we estimate a maximum contamination from diffracted core emission at these locations in to be less than 0.3% , 2% , and 5% respectively .",
    "this is about 117 , 780 and 1950   ergs @xmath11 s@xmath12 sr@xmath12 , which is less than 2% , 7% , and 9% of the actual observed intensity at these locations .",
    "therefore , it is safe to conclude that the contamination from the diffracted emission does not significantly impact our em measurements .    if one assumes that the diffuse emission seen above the core in set1 is equivalent to the diffuse emission present along the line of sight in the studied core regions in set3 , i.e. , equivalent to the foreground / background emission along the line of sight , then it is possible to subtract the diffuse contribution from set3 to obtain the emission from the core plasma itself .",
    "when we do this using an averaged emd from all the masked regions in set1 , the em slopes of the core regions ( set3 ) increase by 0.64 to 0.94 , i.e. , the distributions become steeper . the bottom row ( row 4 ) in figure  [ fig3 ] shows the best linear fits to a sample diffuse region ( left ) , a core region ( middle ) and the same core region after background subtraction ( right ) , with the corresponding slopes . the core observations",
    "may also be contaminated by warm loops in the foreground and background , so this must be considered only a partial correction .",
    "because of their characteristic emd peaking at , slope corrections using diffuse region emd are expected to make the core region distribution steeper .",
    "we caution , however , that the magnitude of the correction is very uncertain .",
    "both the emissivity and the line - of - sight depth of the diffuse plasma could be considerably different at the altitude of set3 than at the altitude of set1 .",
    "ar core emds ( set 3 ) show a clear rollover at about @xmath31 and this is most likely due to the contamination from the underlying moss regions , whose emds are known to peak at @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the emd slopes would get steeper , by about a factor 0.2 ( set 3a ) and 0.8 ( set 3b ) , when estimated with respect to this rollover peak , rather than with respect to the em peak .",
    "since we are interested primarily in the coronal loop top emission and not the emission from footpoint moss regions , the slopes presented here are estimated with respect to the peak em .",
    "@xcite studied _ ar 10961 _ when it was near disk center , when full spectral scan observations were available .",
    "their goal was to measure the em slope of inter - moss regions ( i.e. , of the ar core ) . because of the on - disk observing geometry , lines - of - sight through the inter - moss regions included contributions from higher altitude diffuse emission above the core . to estimate to the magnitude of these contributions , they examined additional lines - of - sight outside the core and made adjustments to account for gravitational stratification .",
    "the diffuse emission was thereby estimated to contribute between 5 and 40@xmath32 of the total em at @xmath33 along the line of sight through the core .",
    "our limb measurements of this same active region give compatible results .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows that , at this temperature , the diffuse emission ( set1 ) is roughly 20@xmath32 of the core emission ( set3 ) .",
    "the boundary region emission ( set2 ) is roughly 30@xmath32 of the core emission .",
    "this suggests that the method used by @xcite to remove the diffuse component from their core measurements is reasonable .",
    "they estimated a potential error in the em slope of less than 0.1 .",
    "we caution that the observing geometries are completely different for these two studies and that a horizontal integration through a point above the limb may be much different from vertical integration through the same point .",
    "in addition , we could not study the effect of gravitational stratification at the height of the ar core , even by assuming the diffuse emission to be unresolved loop structures .",
    "this is because , measuring the loop length is not possible in our case taking the diffuse nature of the region into account .",
    "hence our results may not be comparable with the results of @xcite .",
    "our earlier on - disk study of _ ar 10961 _ @xcite benefited from a full spectral scan , which we do not have for our present limb study of this region .",
    "the lack of spectral lines hotter than @xmath34 prevents us from fully characterizing the core plasma , but we can obtain a rather complete picture of the diffuse and boundary region plasma .",
    "similar to the analysis performed for _ ar 10939 _ , we have chosen different regions ( shown in the top right panel fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) and have grouped them in different sets , namely set1 , set2 and set3 . the unrevised ( row 2 ) and the revised ( row 3 ) emds for set  2 and set  3 are plotted in the middle and right panels , and those for set  1 are plotted in the left panels in fig .",
    "similar to active region ar 10939 , we have plotted the em for m9 and m10 with pluses and regions m11 and m12 with triangles to differentiate between with regions with and without possible moss contribution .",
    "the emds for set2 and set3 appear very similar to those for _",
    "ar 10939 _ , except that we do not find the peak above @xmath34 .",
    "this is because we do not have spectral lines at those temperatures ( above temperature ) in this study .",

    "ar 10939_. however , this region is still useful for studying the diffuse region due to the fact that the em for diffuse region peaks at @xmath0 as established earlier for _ ar 10939 _ using the full spectral scan ( assuming that the active regions are similar ) .",

    "slopes measured with the revised calibration are smaller by about 0.9 , at least for the diffuse regions where we have studied the difference ( table  [ table_slope_emratio ] ) .",

    "the slopes of the emd curves and the hot to warm ratios for diffuse regions obtained in this study is within the range of values obtained for active regions cores .",
