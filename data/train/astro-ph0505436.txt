    "it has recently been shown that black holes could be formed at future colliders if the planck scale is of order a tev , as is the case in some extra - dimension scenarios @xcite .",
    "this idea has driven a considerable amount of interest : see _ e.g. _ @xcite . the same phenomenon could also occur ( and could be detected ) due to ultrahigh energy neutrino interactions in the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "such possibilities open very exciting ways to search for new physics , _",
    "e.g. _ quantum - gravitational effects through a gauss - bonnet term in the action @xcite , higgs production @xcite , evaporation into supersymmetric particles @xcite or a d - dimensional cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "this article aims at clarifying the situation about the possible consequences of an astrophysical and cosmological production of microscopic black holes ( @xmath0bh ) in the universe .",
    "this is especially important as it has been argued that a low planck scale could already be excluded by the available data on galactic cosmic - rays .",
    "the first section summarizes the general framework of tev planck scale models and the basics of cross section computations .",
    "section 2 is devoted to the investigation of black hole production by the interaction of high energy cosmic - rays with the inter - stellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the subsequent decay of those black holes and the propagation of the emitted particles are also studied .",
    "section 3 deals with a few other exotic possibilities , including black hole relics and thermal creation of black holes in the early universe .",
    "finally , we conclude that scenarios lowering the planck scale in the tev era are viable from the astrophysical point of view .",
    "the `` large extra dimensions '' scenario @xcite is a very elegant way to address geometrically the hierarchy problem ( among others ) , allowing only the gravity to propagate in the bulk .",
    "the gauss law relates the planck scale of the effective 4d low - energy theory @xmath1 with the fundamental planck scale @xmath2 through the volume of the compactified dimensions , @xmath3 , via : @xmath4 it is thus possible to set @xmath5  tev without being in contradiction with any currently available experimental data .",
    "this translates into radii values between a fraction of a millimeter and a few fermi for the compactification radius of the extra dimensions ( assumed to be of same size and flat , _",
    "i.e. _ of toroidal shape ) .",
    "furthermore , such a small value for the planck energy is not artificial and could be somehow expected so as to minimize the difference between the electroweak and planck scales , as motivated by the construction of this approach .",
    "in such a scenario , at sub - weak energies , the standard model ( sm ) fields must be localized to a 4-dimensional manifold of weak scale `` thickness '' in the extra dimensions . as shown in @xcite , as an example based on a dynamical assumption with d=6 , it is possible to build such a sm field localization .",
    "this is however the non - trivial task of those models .",
    "+ another important way for realizing tev scale gravity arises from properties of warped extra - dimensional geometries used in randall - sundrum scenarios @xcite .",
    "if the warp factor is small in the vicinity of the standard model brane , particle masses can take tev values , thereby giving rise to a large hierarchy between the tev and conventional planck scales @xcite .",
    "strong gravitational effects are therefore also expected in high energy scattering processes on the brane .",
    "+ in those frameworks , black holes could be formed by any interaction above the planck scale .",
    "two elementary particles with a center - of - mass energy @xmath6 moving in opposite directions with an impact parameter less than the horizon radius @xmath7 should form a black hole of mass @xmath8 with a cross section expected to be of order @xmath9 .",
    "those values are in fact approximations as the black hole mass will be only a fraction of the center - of - mass energy whose exact value depends on the dimensionality of the space - time and on the angular momentum of the produced black hole .",
    "a significant part of the incoming energy is lost to gravitational radiation . in particular , lower limits on the inelasticity ( ratio of the mass of the formed black hole to the incoming parton energy ) where derived in @xcite as a function of the impact parameter .",
    "although those bounds where slightly increased in @xcite , they still can be considered as reasonable estimates of the consequences of the inelasticity and where shown in @xcite to drastically reduce the expected number of produced black holes . to remain conservative ( and except otherwise stated ) the computations performed in this article use a unity inelasticity to maximise the emitted flux and strengthen the conclusions .",
    "+ to compute the real probability to form black holes in a nuclei collision , it is necessary to take into account that only a fraction of the total center - of - mass energy is carried out by each parton and to convolve the previous estimate with the parton luminosity @xcite .",
    "the proton - proton cross section can be written as @xmath10    where @xmath11 are the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) and @xmath12^\\frac{2}{d-3}.\\ ] ] + those pdfs can be inferred from @xcite or rescaled from @xcite at various center - of - mass energies by taking advantage of the fact that they only depend on @xmath13 after an appropriate change of variables . + up to now , the different works related with those phenomena have focused on the production of @xmath0bhs at colliders or through neutrino interactions in the earth atmosphere .",
    "the first approach is extremely promising as it would allow those fascinating objects to be formed and to evaporate within the largest and more sophisticated detectors ever built by human beings .",
    "many new physics effects could be discovered , related with the dimensionality of space - time , with the radii of extra - dimensions , with new particles , with quantum gravity , etc .",
    "the second approach is based on the higher center - of - mass energy available when extremely high energy neutrinos ( allowing for a high signal to noise ratio due do the very small standard model cross sections ) interact with atmospheric nuclei .",
    "+ on the other hand , there are other places in the universe where one should expect @xmath0bhs to be formed if the planck scale lies in the tev range .",
    "namely , the ism where high energy cosmic - ray interactions occur above this threshold and the very early universe where the temperature could have been arbitrarily high .",
    "the specific energy and time scales associated with those particular conditions deserve a dedicated study .",
    "the number of black holes produced by cosmic - rays on the interstellar medium per unit of time , per unit of volume and per unit of mass can be written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the ism proton density and @xmath16 is the cosmic - ray differential spectrum at energy @xmath17 . assuming that the ism is made of 90% of hydrogen and 10% of helium , @xmath15 can be taken at @xmath18  @xmath19 .",
    "as we deal with a diffusion process insensitive to local overdensities or underdensities , this average approximation holds very well . for @xmath20  tev , which is the order of magnitude of the lowest planck scale value compatible with experimental data ( see references in @xcite ) ,",
    "the threshold energy for cosmic - rays is @xmath21  gev , which lies just below the knee .",
    "measurements from the kaskade experiment @xcite where used to evaluate @xmath22 , taking into account the different contributions from hydrogen , helium , carbon , silicon and iron .",
    "the cross sections have been derived , following @xcite , by the method given in section 2 .",
    "table [ tab1 ] gives the resulting differential numbers of @xmath0bhs produced and their initial temperatures as a function of their mass for two different planck scales and two extreme numbers of dimensions ( @xmath23 is not included as a very low planck scale with only one extra dimension is already excluded on the ground of the dynamics of the solar system ) .",
    "+ it can be seen that the production rate is small , due to the low value of the flux in this pev - eev range .",
    "it is also very sensitive to the @xmath0bh mass because the cross section for @xmath24 is a fast decreasing function of @xmath25 .",
    "nevertheless , when the volume of our galaxy @xmath26  m@xmath27 is taken in account this leads to @xmath28 @xmath0bhs created per second within the milky way for @xmath29  tev .",
    "the d - dependence is very weak and not included in the table as uncertainties clearly dominate at this level of accuracy .",
    "+    .production rate and initial temperature of @xmath0bhs for different numbers of dimensions , different planck scales and different masses . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to investigate the experimental consequences of those possibly formed black holes , their evaporation should be taken into account .",
    "as already studied for 4-dimensional primordial black holes @xcite antiprotons are very promising for this purpose as their abundance is both well known and very small when compared to matter cosmic - rays ( @xmath30 ) @xcite . the source term for this process can be written as :    @xmath31 @xmath32    where @xmath33 stands for the number of emitted quanta by a black hole of mass @xmath25 and temperature @xmath34  : @xmath35 .",
    "the relative number of quarks or gluons of type @xmath36 is @xmath37 and the fragmentation function for such a parton of energy @xmath34 into an antiproton of kinetic energy @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 .",
    "this term also depends on @xmath17 as the produced @xmath0bh is lorentz boosted with respect to the galactic frame .",
    "it has been determined using the lund model pythia @xcite monte - carlo generator , between the thresholds @xmath40 and @xmath41 , as shown on the example of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] where the important rle played by the center - of - mass velocity can be easily seen .",
    "once this source term is established , the produced antiprotons should be allowed to propagate within the galaxy . for this purpose , a two zone diffusion model described in @xcite & @xcite",
    "have been used . in this approach ,",
    "the geometry of the milky - way is a cylindrical box embedded in a diffusion halo whose extension is still subject to large uncertainties .",
    "the five parameters used are  : @xmath42 , @xmath43 ( describing the diffusion coefficient @xmath44 ) , the halo half height l , the convective velocity @xmath45 and the alfvn velocity @xmath46 .",
    "they have been varied within a given range determined by an exhaustive and systematic study of cosmic - ray nuclei data @xcite and chosen at their mean value .",
    "the spectrum is affected by energy losses when antiprotons interact with the galactic interstellar matter and by energy gains when reacceleration occurs .",
    "these energy changes are described by an intricate integro  differential equation @xcite where a source term @xmath47 was added , leading to the so - called tertiary component which corresponds to inelastic but non - annihilating reactions of @xmath48 on interstellar matter .",
    "+ figure [ fig2 ] shows the resulting antiproton spectrum around its maximum .",
    "the different curves correspond to different astrophysical parameters and to the interstellar and `` top of atmosphere '' fluxes .",
    "the inelasticity has also been taken into account @xcite as a simple resclaling as those results are extremely weakly dependant upon the details of the shape of the mass spectrum . in any case , they remain extremely far below the background which lies at the level of a few @xmath49  gev@xmath50sr@xmath50s@xmath50 . but it should be pointed out that the spectrum is much harder than the background .",
    "the reasons for this are quite straightforward .",
    "first , although quite high for an exotic process , the cross section for @xmath0bhs production is small when compared to sm processes : it is of the order of a few hundreds picobarns at the threshold whereas the total @xmath51 cross section is not far from 100  mb with an antiproton multiplicity close to one for @xmath52  tev .",
    "this explains the overall normalization around the maximum .",
    "furthermore , the antiproton flux results from the convolution of the primary cosmic - ray spectrum with the fragmentation function . for the secondary component ( antiprotons due du @xmath51 interactions ) , this fragmentation function is not far from a dirac distribution and the spectrum is expected to have roughly the same slope than the primary one . for the @xmath0bh component considered in this article , the fragmentation function",
    "is substantially widened by the boost and becomes the hardest function of the convolution equation .",
    "the resulting spectrum therefore exhibits the same slope and becomes much harder than for the secondary component .",
    "the confinement effects due to the galactic magnetic field induce a softening of the spectra below the knee but the spectral index difference remains the same whatever the energy . due to this important slope difference , the antiproton flux due to @xmath0bhs should dominate over the secondary one around @xmath53  gev .",
    "although this could allow for interesting experimental tests of low planck scale theories in a far future , this remains extremely far above the currently highest energies measured ( @xmath54  gev for antiprotons ) .",
    "+ another potential concern about the @xmath0bhs production compatibility with data is related to the flux of emitted gamma - rays .",
    "they result both from the direct emission and from the decay of neutral pions .",
    "as the number of partonic degrees of freedom dominates over the electromagnetic ones in the standard model , this latter component is clearly dominant .",
    "it is much higher than the antiproton emission ( as pions are much more numerous in the fragmentation process ) but so is the astrophysical background .",
    "the resulting gamma - ray spectrum has been estimated using the pythia generator to compute the pion distribution and there decay .",
    "it has then been lorentz transformed and integrated over the matter distribution of the galaxy .",
    "it has also been checked , as in @xcite , that the extragalactic contribution is much lower than the galactic one . the gamma - ray spectrum due to",
    "@xmath0bhs remains lower than the background up to energies of @xmath55  gev ( this latter being extrapolated with a power law above the currently measured energy range ) .",
    "such energies , far above the gzk cutoff , are meaningless , especially when considering that the primary cosmic - ray component necessary to produce the related @xmath0bhs should have much higher energies .",
    "+ the conclusion of this study is that whatever the considered emitted cosmic - rays , @xmath0bhs that would be currently produced in the universe if the planck scale is around a tev are fully compatible with astrophysical experimental data in spite of a production rate around @xmath56  ghz per galaxy .",
    "it could also be thought that the possible thermal production of @xmath0bhs in the early universe should conflict with observations .",
    "if the temperature of the universe reached values above the d - dimensional planck scale @xmath2 , @xmath0bhs are indeed expected to have formed through the scattering of the thermal radiation .",
    "the production and subsequent evaporation of such small black holes is irrelevant as long as it takes place before the nucleosynthesis  : it just contributes to the thermal bath . on the other hand ,",
    "if black holes mostly decay after the nucleosynthesis , the entropy released could modify the relative abundances of light elements and contradict the observational data ( as it is well known for the gravitino problem in inflationary cosmology ) .",
    "the mass of a d - dimensional @xmath0bh with lifetime @xmath57 is given by  : @xmath58 depending on the number of extra dimensions , the energy required to produce black holes that will survive during @xmath54  s ( _ i.e. _ until the nucleosynthesis ) is of the order of @xmath59  gev , which is above the usual quadri - dimensional planck scale and clearly meaningless",
    ". it can therefore be safely considered that @xmath0bhs thermally created in the early universe are not expected to induce any substantial changes in the sensitive primordial @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 abundances . +",
    "a last point to address is the possible formation of stable relics at the end of the evaporation process .",
    "based on several different arguments ( _ e.g. _ gauss - bonnet solutions in string gravity @xcite or a renormalization group modification of the schwarzschild metric @xcite ) , it has recently been pointed out that , in agreement with the `` cosmic censorship '' hypothesis , black hole relics are expected to survive the hawking evaporation , even in models with extra - dimensions . in the planck region ,",
    "the semi - classical approach can not be safely used anymore and quantum gravitational effects must be taken into account . although no reliable theory is yet established , most attempts trying to deal with the endpoint of the evaporation process lead to the conclusion that stable relics should be formed . depending on the details of the underlying model , their mass",
    "is expected to lie around the planck mass .",
    "the possible contribution of those relics to the cold dark matter budget has been extensively studied in the framework of 4-dimensional black holes - see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite - but it should be investigated whether the d - dimensional black holes produced by cosmic - ray interactions on the ism could lead to a substantial amount of remnants .",
    "the total mass induced by this process in our galaxy can be computed by integrating the formula given at the beginning of section 2  : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the age of the universe , @xmath66 is the galaxy formation epoch , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the milky - way radius and height and @xmath69 is the relics expected mass .",
    "this leads to a tiny value @xmath70  g which means that relics dark - matter is negligible and therefore remains compatible with observations .",
    "this study shows that the concern related with @xmath0bhs created by astrophysical processes ( either in the galaxy or in the primordial universe ) which could conflict with experimental data ( either through the emitted cosmic - rays or through the possible relics ) is irrelevant . from the point of view of black hole formation , the earth atmosphere and colliders",
    "are probably the only places where a tev planck scale should have observational consequences .",
    "theoretical motivations for extra - dimensional models are therefore not currently contradicted by astroparticle physics phenomenology . on the other hand ,",
    "some space is still open for new phenomena due to @xmath0bh evaporation in the galaxy  : as their production cross - section has no suppression factor and as their coupling with any quantum during the evaporation process is purely gravitational , one can expect an abundant production of rare particles .",
    "furthermore , because of the large center - of - mass velocity with respect to the galactic frame , those particles are expected to lie in the high energy range with a hard spectrum .",
    "although this would make a significant difference with the usual background thermal distributions , a clear detection seems quite doubtful and would require a specific investigation ."
