    "particle transport in magnetically confined plasmas devices such as tokamaks and stellarators is commonly studied using the @xmath6 drift approximation of the guiding center motion that neglects finite larmor radius ( flr ) effects @xcite .",

    "one strategy to advance our understanding of this problem without the need of invoking the solution of turbulence models is to use a simplified description for the electrostatic potential .",
    "this approach , which is the one adopted in the present paper , has opened the possibility of studying @xmath6 transport using advanced methods and ideas from dynamical systems ( see for example refs .  @xcite and reference therein ) . in particular , based on a weak - turbulence type assumption , we model the drift - wave electrostatic potential as a superposition of modes that allows to reduce the problem to a discrete hamiltonian map .",
