    "<S> sers probes are postulated to offer bright and stable signals and extensive multiplexing @xcite , while it has been assumed that experimental best practice parallels that of fluorescent probes , i.e. that one should excite at the strongest resonance and use a high concentration . </S>",
    "<S> thusfar , the design of nanoparticle - based sers experiments has focused on maximizing the local electromagnetic field enhancement in or around an individual particle @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this strategy fails to take into account the physics of propagation in the bulk medium where the same processes which give rise to enhancement also lead to increased extinction of both the illumination and the raman scattered light . </S>",
