    "pump - probe experiments with femtosecond time resolution can record various nonequilibrium processes in solids directly in the time domain , including those induced by the coulomb interaction between electrons , or the scattering of electrons on defects and phonons . in these experiments",
    "excitation of the sample and characterization of the excited state are accomplished by two distinct laser pulses ( pump and probe ) which hit the sample with controlled time delay , and either optical or photoemission spectroscopy may be used as probe technique .",
    "the pump - probe setup has been used to investigate the dynamics of molecules,@xcite semiconductors,@xcite and metals@xcite for more than two decades .",
    "more recently , such time - resolved experiments were also performed on several strongly correlated materials close to a phase transition , where many degrees of freedom contribute to the dynamics on very different time scales .",
    "@xcite    in such nonequilibrium solid - state experiments it is a major challenge to distinguish the electronic dynamics from other degrees of freedom .",
    "this is crucial in particular for the mott metal - insulator transition,@xcite which is driven by the coulomb interaction between electrons moving in a crystal lattice .",
    "an entirely new perspective on this phenomenon would open up if one could observe the transition as it happens in real time and , e.g. , monitor the formation of well - defined quasiparticles as the system goes from an insulating to a metallic state .",
    "in fact , in several mott and charge - transfer insulators the transition to a metallic state can be induced by a laser pump pulse.@xcite so far these experiments have focused on the relaxation back to the insulating state , which involves coupling to degrees of freedom other than the valence band electrons , and is much slower than the buildup of the metallic state after the pump pulse . in the simplest case the observed relaxation is described by the two - temperature model,@xcite i.e. , as the cooling of a hot electron gas which is coupled to the colder lattice.@xcite the true dynamics of the electronic system has so far been observed only in simple metals , by looking at the thermalization of pump - excited electron distributions due to electron - electron scattering.@xcite in strongly correlated materials , thermalization is apparently much faster .",
    "sufficient time resolution is now becoming available due to recent advances in femtosecond laser techniques,@xcite which have already allowed to investigate some solid - state systems even on the attosecond time scale.@xcite    in equilibrium , electronic properties of correlated materials can be obtained directly from conventional photoemission spectroscopy with continuous light beams.@xcite by contrast , time - resolved measurements are likely to be restricted by the frequency - time uncertainty of the probe pulse : the energy @xmath0 of occupied states in the solid from which photoelectrons are released is determined from the kinetic energy of the photoelectrons , the work function of the solid , and the photon energy @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 ; when the measurement pulse has finite duration @xmath4 , the latter is determined only up to an uncertainty @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 . in a strongly correlated electron system",
    "we would expect that typical relaxation times are directly related to the energy scales that appear in the spectrum , such as the bandwidth or the mott gap . in this case",
    "all information on the initial energy @xmath0 is lost for pulses which are short enough to resolve the electronic dynamics .",
    "the equilibrium interpretation of conventional photoemission data in terms of the electronic spectrum of the solid thus becomes meaningless in this limit .",
    "a full theory for time - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( trpes ) , which covers both the nonequilibrium effects of the electronic state and also the consequences of the frequency uncertainty of the pulse , was presented recently by freericks _",
    "et al._.@xcite their approach extends existing theories of conventional photoemission spectroscopy to the case where the sample is not in equilibrium and measurement pulses have a finite time duration . the photoemission intensity as a function of the probe pulse delay time is related to electronic one - particle real - time green functions of the sample,@xcite which fully incorporate the nonequilibrium many - body dynamics after the pump pulse",
    "this is in contrast to earlier green function approaches,@xcite which treat pump and probe on the same ( perturbative ) level .",
    "the relation to real - time green functions allows to make direct contact to recent progress in nonequilibrium many - body theory , such as the extension of dynamical mean - field theory@xcite ( dmft ) to nonequilibrium .",
    "@xcite dmft , which is exact in the limit of infinite dimensions,@xcite can provide insights into the real - time evolution of strongly correlated systems in a nonperturbative way .    the new one - particle description of trpes given in ref",
    ".   leads to the question whether real - time green functions can be recovered fully from the time - dependent photoemission intensity , or whether parts of the electronic time evolution are not accessible by trpes at all .",
    "freericks  _ et al .",
    "_ discussed the case when electronic _ equilibrium states _ are probed by pulses of finite time duration.@xcite this analysis covers experiments ( e.g. , those of ref .  ) in which changes of external parameters such as the electronic temperature determine the dynamics of the electronic state , but the probe pulses are not short enough to resolve the thermalization of the electronic system in response to the pump pulse . for this case the electronic state is characterized by its frequency - dependent spectrum , and the photoemission intensity is given by this spectrum , broadened in accordance with the frequency - time uncertainty.@xcite such a broadening can hamper the determination of the electronic spectrum from photoemission data ; for the experiment of ref .",
    ", however , it plays a minor role.@xcite    by contrast , in this paper we investigate trpes with ultrashort pulses that do resolve the thermalization of the electrons after the pump pulse .",
    "we consider systems with a purely hamiltonian time evolution involving only electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "the electronic state is then no longer characterized only by a frequency - dependent spectrum , but rather by real - time green functions depending on two time variables .",
    "we will show from the general theory of ref .   that in this case the full time dependence on both time variables can not be recovered from the time - dependent photoemission intensity , no matter how the pulse length of the probe pulse is chosen . while time - resolved photoemission data can be predicted from calculated nonequilibrium green functions,@xcite",
    "the converse procedure is thus impossible due to the frequency - time uncertainty relation .",
    "we note that an analogous limitation is absent in time - resolved optical spectroscopy , where a two - time optical conductivity @xmath8 can be measured precisely by making the probe pulses sufficiently short . in nonequilibrium dmft , @xmath8 is directly related to momentum - averaged real - time green functions under certain conditions.@xcite    below we employ the falicov - kimball model,@xcite which describes localized and mobile electrons on a lattice interacting via a local hubbard interaction , to study the relation between nonequilibrium green functions and time - resolved photoemission data in detail .",
    "we consider an idealized setup in which the system is suddenly driven out of a metallic or insulating equilibrium state , and subsequently relaxes to a new phase due to the hamiltonian dynamics of the electrons .",
    "this model situation was recently solved with nonequilibrium dmft.@xcite we then study hypothetical time - resolved photoemission experiments during this relaxation process , and find that some aspects of the formation of the metallic state are indeed obscured in the photoemission spectrum due to the frequency - time uncertainty .",
    "on the other hand , the relaxation of an excited mott insulator leads to characteristic collapse - and - revival oscillations,@xcite which result in oscillating mid - gap weight in the time - resolved photoemission spectrum .",
    "the above - mentioned uncertainty limitations notwithstanding , trpes with ultrashort pulses is well - suited to characterize nonequilibrium states of correlated electron systems . however , it will often be necessary to analyze in detail how the time evolution of the green function translates into the photoemission signal .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : trpes ] we briefly outline the microscopic formulation of trpes derived in ref .   and further discuss the role of the frequency - time uncertainty in this theory .",
    "we then introduce the falicov - kimball model ( sec .",
    "[ sec : fkm ] ) and discuss hypothetical time - resolved photoemission measurements on systems that relax to a metallic state ( sec .  [ sec : i2 m ] ) and to an insulating state ( sec .",
    "[ sec : m2i ] ) .",
    "the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] concludes the presentation .",
    "in photoemission experiments with both temporal and angular resolution the sample is probed with a finite pulse of definite wave vector@xcite @xmath9 .",
    "the detector collects the photoelectrons which are emitted in a certain direction @xmath10 , and it is sensitive to their kinetic energy @xmath11",
    "@xmath2 @xmath12 , but not to their arrival time ( @xmath13 @xmath2 @xmath14 is the photoelectron momentum ) .",
    "the time - resolved photoemission signal is thus proportional to the total number of electrons per solid angle @xmath15 and energy interval @xmath16 @xmath17 that are emitted in response to a pulse that hits the sample at time @xmath18.@xcite this definition includes only photoelectrons excited by the probe pulse and omits direct photoemission due to the pump pulse .    in ref .",
    "an expression for the photoemission signal  ( [ arpes - intensity ] ) was derived , using only the so - called sudden approximation,@xcite which neglects the interaction of photoelectrons with the remaining sample .",
    "the photoemission signal is then only related to matrix elements @xmath19 which couple bloch states with quasi - momentum @xmath20 in the solid and one - electron scattering states with asymptotic momentum @xmath13 via absorption of a photon with momentum @xmath9 , and to the real - time one - particle green function @xmath21.\\ ] ] the latter incorporates the full nonequilibrium dynamics of the sample : @xmath22 @xmath2 @xmath23 are annihilation ( creation ) operators for electrons in the solid with momentum @xmath20 , whose propagation in time , with @xmath24 @xmath2 @xmath25 $ ] , includes all external fields except for the probe .",
    "the initial state at some early time @xmath26 is usually given by the thermal ensemble at temperature @xmath27 , @xmath28 @xmath29",
    "@xmath30 $ ] . the presence of the surface and the dependence of photoemission spectra on matrix elements can substantially complicate the comparison of theoretical and experimental data for specific materials . in order to reveal general aspects of trpes",
    "we thus resort to further approximations that are commonly made in this context : ( i ) we assume that photoemission measures the bulk properties of the sample which are contained in the momentum - diagonal green function @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 of the infinite and translationally invariant system , and ( ii ) , we take matrix elements to be constant but satisfying momentum conservation in the plane , @xmath34 @xmath32 @xmath35 . the time - resolved photoemission spectrum  ( [ arpes - intensity ] )",
    "is then given by@xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the ( real ) pulse envelope function ( centered at @xmath38 @xmath2 @xmath39 ) and @xmath40 is the work function of the solid .",
    "note that eqn .",
    "( [ arpes-2d ] ) and ( [ arpes - simple ] ) become exact for perfectly layered ( two - dimensional ) structures , when @xmath20 denotes the two - dimensional momentum of the sample . in the following",
    "we will discuss the momentum- and frequency - dependent expression  ( [ arpes - simple ] ) .",
    "for simplicity we will refer to eq .",
    "( [ arpes - simple ] ) as the photoemission intensity ; observations made for this function presumably persist after summation over some part of the brillouin zone [ eq .",
    "( [ arpes-2d ] ) ] .",
    "( [ arpes - simple ] ) simplifies when the system is in equilibrium . in this case",
    "green functions depend on the time difference only , and the fourier transform is given by@xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the equilibrium spectral function,@xcite and @xmath43 @xmath2 @xmath44 is the fermi function for temperature @xmath27 .",
    "the photoemission intensity then reduces to @xmath45 which is a convolution of the well - known expression @xmath46",
    "@xmath29 @xmath47 for the intrinsic photocurrent in continuous beam experiments@xcite with the fourier transform @xmath48 @xmath2 @xmath49 of the pulse envelope . due to the frequency - time uncertainty of the pulse",
    ", the frequency - dependent spectrum is thus smoothened on a scale @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 when the pulse has a finite length @xmath4 , as discussed in refs .   and .",
    "here we study the case of an electronic system that is not in equilibrium .",
    "the green function @xmath53 then contains important information both in the absolute time @xmath54 and in the time difference @xmath55 between addition and removal of an electron .",
    "however , when the probe pulse extends only over a finite length @xmath56 , the product @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ arpes - simple ] ) vanishes for all @xmath54 @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath51 @xmath56 , and hence @xmath53 enters eq .",
    "( [ arpes - simple ] ) only for @xmath55 @xmath60 @xmath56 .",
    "it is therefore impossible to deduce @xmath53 from spectra that were recorded with pulses of length @xmath56 @xmath60 @xmath55 .",
    "in other words , the time resolution ( in  @xmath54 ) with which @xmath53 can be measured is limited by @xmath55 .",
    "this also becomes clear when attempting to invert the convolution of @xmath61 in eq .",
    "( [ arpes - simple ] ) : starting from the fourier transform @xmath62 and using , e.g. , gaussian pulses , @xmath63 we obtain @xmath64 while the integral in  ( [ its3 ] ) apparently measures @xmath65 with a time resolution of @xmath56 , it is practically impossible to choose @xmath56 @xmath66 @xmath55 because then the result vanishes compared to any noise added to @xmath67 , due to the gaussian prefactor ( whose form is due to ( [ gauss ] ) but the suppression of the signal for @xmath56 @xmath66 @xmath55 is independent of the pulse shape ) .",
    "we conclude that the nonequilibrium two - time green function can not be fully measured by means of trpes , and one must always carefully analyze how the time evolution of the green function translates into the photoemission signal for a given theoretical model .",
    "this will be illustrated for the falicov - kimball model below .",
    "in the remaining part of this paper we concentrate on one specific model for electronic dynamics in a single band , the falicov - kimball model.@xcite this lattice model describes itinerant  ( @xmath68 ) and immobile  ( @xmath69 ) electrons which interact via the local coulomb repulsion  @xmath70 .",

    "hopping between sites @xmath73 and @xmath77 ( with amplitude @xmath78 ) is possible only for the mobile  ( @xmath68 ) particles . the falicov - kimball model has been an important benchmark for the development of dmft in equilibrium , because the effective single - site problem for the mobile particles is quadratic and can be solved exactly.@xcite this model currently plays a similar role for nonequilibrium dmft,@xcite in particular since no appropriate real - time impurity solver is yet available for the hubbard model .    in spite of its apparent simplicity",
    "the falicov - kimball model has a rich equilibrium phase diagram containing metallic , insulating , and charge - ordered phases.@xcite in the following we consider only the homogeneous phase at half - filling for both particle species ( @xmath79 @xmath2 @xmath80 @xmath2 @xmath81 ) , which in equilibrium undergoes a metal - insulator transition at a critical interaction @xmath70 @xmath2 @xmath82 on the order of the bandwidth.@xcite this phase is studied in an idealized nonequilibrium situation , by preparing the system in thermal equilibrium for times @xmath54 @xmath60 @xmath39 , and changing the interaction parameter @xmath70 abruptly at @xmath54 @xmath2 @xmath39.@xcite of course within a more realistic description of the pump pulse the system would not be excited into a state that is an equilibrium state of any simple hamiltonian .",
    "nonetheless , the _ interaction quench _ we study here allows us to discuss time - resolved photoemission signals for a situation in which the electronic dynamics drives the system between different phases .",
    "since the exact dmft solution for the interaction quench is available@xcite we can directly relate green functions and photoemisson signals .",
    "in particular , we will focus on two specific phenomena , namely ( i ) the formation of narrow quasiparticle resonances during the buildup of the metallic state ( sec .",
