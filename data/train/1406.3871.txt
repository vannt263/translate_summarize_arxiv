    "otherwise , for sources with relatively large fractional polarization , fractional polarization is almost independent of rrm . if we choose sources that have fractional polarization larger than 4 % as an example of the criterion , we obtain 1776 out of 3650 sources ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "note that the 1776 sources are distributed broadly in redshift , suggesting that the source selection would not selectively exclude high - redshift sources .",
    "it has also been argued that rms of intervening galaxies correlate with optical absorption - line systems @xcite .",
    "hence , no - exg sources may be also identifiable via optical spectroscopy .",
    "optical absorption - line data to high - redshift ( @xmath95 ) objects are already available @xcite , and in future we expect that data will be obtained toward more sources .",
    "so far , @xcite have found 40,429 mgii  absorbers in the spectra of 84,534 quasars in the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "this indicates @xmath96 , since some sdss qsos have multiple absorbers .",
    "based on the above results , we adopt @xmath97 as a conservative value .",

    "two - dimensional rm maps are constructed as follows .",
    "we consider a fov of @xmath70 toward the south galactic pole , and randomly distribute polarized sources over the distribution in redshift adopted in  [ subsection2.1 ] .",
    "the fov consists of @xmath105 pixels divided evenly ; one source is placed in each pixel , and we use the coordinate of the pixel as the position of that source .",

    "source counts to be obtained with future telescopes such as the ska and askap are a topic of current discussion .",
    "recent works provide careful estimates of source counts @xcite .",

    ", we try to extract the igm map by filtering sources .",
    "we study the extent to which statistics for the filtered sources match statistics for the cluster - subtracted sources in the igm map .",
    "the filtering process is as follows .",
    "first , we discard 50 % of sources for which the los passes through intervening galaxies .",
    "no - exg sources can be identified in real data with depolarization and/or optical counterparts ( section 2.4 ) .",
    "second , we exclude nearby sources ( @xmath111 ) to reduce the contribution of intrinsic rms , where @xmath112 is a threshold redshift and we assume that we know the redshifts of all detected radio sources . we define @xmath113",
    "@xmath110 as the sky density of the remaining , filtered sources .",
    "finally , we subtract the large - angular - scale structure mostly induced by the ism map by applying a high - pass filter .",
    "the residual rm ( rrm ) map then corresponds to our estimate of the igm map .",
    "the rrm is given by @xmath114 where @xmath115 are the coordinates in the map , and mrm is the mean rm obtained by averaging rms of the filtered sources over a smoothing diameter , @xmath116 centered at @xmath115 . in the calculation of mrm , we exclude the source we are trying to filter from the count , and iteratively exclude aberrant sources , defined as sources with an rm more than @xmath117 from the mean .",
    "sources for a @xmath70 fov .",
    "the red , blue , and gray lines show power spectra for the igm , ism , and igm+ism , respectively .",
    "[ f2 ] ]    figure  [ f2 ] shows the power spectra of the igm and ism maps .",
    "we see that the power of the igm map overtakes that of the ism map at @xmath118 , suggesting @xmath119 as a good choice for the high - pass filter .",
    "a small contribution from the ism may remain in the rrm map , but the contribution should be several times smaller than the igm .",
    "another consideration for deciding @xmath116 is that sufficient neighboring sources should exist within a diameter @xmath116 to ensure a reasonable foreground removal .",
    "we define @xmath120 as the number of neighboring sources within @xmath116 , and decided to exclude sources with @xmath121 from our statistical analysis .",
    "the mean number of neighboring sources is given by @xmath122 , i.e. , @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 for @xmath126 @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 , respectively .",
    "therefore , to satisfy @xmath130 , we adopt @xmath131 if @xmath132  deg@xmath2 , and @xmath133 for other values of @xmath113 . as a result of these choices ,",
    "most of sources have @xmath134 , and our results do not dramatically change if we allow @xmath135 or if we include the source we are trying to filter in the count .    it should be noted that we can utilize a larger number of sources in the calculation of rrm , if we apply a high - pass filter before filtering sources . in this case , however , we confirmed that the resultant rrm map substantially underestimates the igm map , since a corresponding mrm map always overestimates the ism map due to the contribution of intrinsic rms of low - redshift sources .",

    "panels from left to right show the results for different threshold redshifts , and panels from top to bottom show the results for different source densities .",
    "overall , the pdf for @xmath140  deg@xmath2 ( corresponding to current observational capabilities ) has large statistical uncertainties due to a lack of usable sources ( @xmath141 0.42 , 0.26 , and 0.13  deg@xmath2 for @xmath136 0.0 , 1.0 , and 2.0 , respectively ) .",
    "but for all cases , even with @xmath140  deg@xmath2 , we confirmed that the non - zero mean of @xmath142 seen in the com map ( gray ) is satisfactorily removed in the rrm map ( red ) .",
    "in other words , the high - pass filter is effective in removing large - scale ( @xmath143 several degree ) coherent structures of rm caused mostly by the ism map , even for currently obtainable source densities .",
    "statistical uncertainties are greatly improved for @xmath144  deg@xmath2 and become almost negligible for @xmath145  deg@xmath2 .",
    "the high - pass filter becomes more accurate and adequately removes structures down to a scale of a few degrees for @xmath146  deg@xmath2 .",
    "we see that the rrm map still contains a large rm variance after we removed the large - scale structure in rm due to the ism ( figure  [ f2 ] ) .",
    "the variance can not be ascribed to exg rms , since we have already removed the sources that may have large exg rms .",
    "therefore , if err rms ( we input @xmath24 1 @xmath13 ) are sufficiently small compared to the standard deviation of @xmath147  @xmath13 for the rrm map , the variance in the rrm map can be mostly ascribed to int and igm rms .",
    "let us now use only high - redshift sources for which int rms should be small ( @xmath148 ) in our model .",
    "the results with @xmath136 1.0 or 2.0 clearly indicate that the rrm map still has significant levels of rm variance , which can be attributed to igm rms .",
    "we find that the standard deviation of the rrm map for high - redshift sources nicely reproduces that of the input igm map .",
    "for instance , relative differences of @xmath149 to @xmath33 are @xmath150 for @xmath144  deg@xmath2 , @xmath151 for @xmath152  deg@xmath2 , and @xmath153 for @xmath154  deg@xmath2 .",
    "note that the standard deviation of the igm map for distant sources is larger by @xmath155 than that for all sources , since distant sources tend to have larger rms ( figure  [ f1 ] ) .",
    "a good reconstruction can be also seen in the pdf . for sources with @xmath156 ,",
    "the pdf of the rrm map ( red ) has a broader profile than that of the igm map ( black ) due to int rms , even for @xmath154  deg@xmath2 .",
    "such difference becomes substantially small , if we use only high - redshift sources .",
    "here , the pdf of the rrm map always has a less sharply peaked profile than that of the igm map , because of err rms of @xmath157 .",
    "we have also investigated the cases with @xmath158 and @xmath159 for @xmath146  deg@xmath2 .",
    "we find that for @xmath131 ( not shown in figure  3 ) , we obtain a broader pdf and a larger ( @xmath15sub @xmath13 ) standard deviation than when using @xmath133 .",
    "this is because , when we increase the smoothing diameter , the rrm map contains larger - scale components mostly induced by the ism map .",
    "such components become a source of error in reconstruction of the igm map .",
    "the best choice of value for @xmath116 depends on the actual structure in rm for the igm and ism maps .",
    "the optimal value is @xmath119 for our models , since the power of the igm map overtakes that of the ism map ( figure  [ f2 ] ) at these scales .",

    "results for different values of @xmath165 and @xmath112 are shown in figure [ f4 ] , where the average of the sf within each bin and the standard deviation ( the scatter ) of the sf within each bin are drawn as lines and error bars , respectively .",
    "overall , @xmath164 for @xmath140  deg@xmath2 corresponding to current observational capabilities has large statistical uncertainties due to a lack of usable sources .",
    "we require @xmath166  deg@xmath2 to obtain @xmath164 down to scales of @xmath167 with errors less than @xmath168 , and such accuracy is marginally achieved for @xmath156 with @xmath144  deg@xmath2 .",
    "uncertainties are greatly improved for the cases with @xmath152  deg@xmath2 for which we obtain clear @xmath164 on scales down to sub degrees . for @xmath154  deg@xmath2 as achievable with the ska , @xmath164 could be studied even down to scales of @xmath169 with errors less than @xmath170 .",
    "looking at cases with sufficient source densities ( e.g. @xmath171  deg@xmath2 ) , we see that @xmath164 for the rrm map ( red ) has a flat profile at scales @xmath172 .",
    "this is also evidence that the high - pass filter has satisfactorily removed most ism rms , which show a monotonic increase of @xmath164 from @xmath106 to @xmath173 @xcite as can be partly seen in @xmath164 for the com map ( gray ) .",
    "recall that we have already removed the sources that may have large exg rms ; @xmath164 for the rrm map is thus ascribed to int , igm , and err rms . here ,",
    "@xmath164 for the int and err maps has a flat profile over @xmath174 ( not shown ) , because these structure functions have white - noise spectra in fourier space .",
    "therefore , these contributions enhance @xmath164 at all scales shown , and the amplitude of @xmath164 for the rrm map ( red ) becomes somewhat larger than that for the igm map ( black ) .",
    "such white - noise power is difficult to selectively remove with structure - based filters .",
    "instead , we can use only high - redshift sources for which int rms should be small in our model . the results with @xmath136 1.0 or 2.0",
    "clearly indicate that @xmath164 for the igm map is successfully reconstructed , if we reach @xmath154  deg@xmath2 corresponding to ska observations .",
    "there remains the contribution of err rms , but this is not problematic for the study of the sf , provided that @xmath157 or less .",
    "an important feature of the sf for the igm predicted by @xcite is a decline at smaller scales , @xmath175 .",
    "such a decline is hidden by uncertainties for the cases with @xmath176  deg@xmath2 , but might be seen with @xmath177  deg@xmath2 .",
    "interestingly , although the sf of the rrm map for @xmath156 overestimates that of the igm map , the decline can be seen for @xmath154  deg@xmath2 with the ska , regardless of the redshift criterion @xmath112 .",
    "this is because the igm map is a major component in the com map at these scales .",
    "we have also investigated the cases with @xmath158 and @xmath159 for @xmath178  deg@xmath2 .",
    "we find that for @xmath131 ( not shown ) , the sf of the rrm map shows a slight increase at @xmath179 , induced by the ism map ( not shown ) .",
    "this behavior is consistent with that seen in the pdf ( figure  [ f3 ] ) ; the rrm map contains larger - scale components as we increase the smoothing diameter , mostly induced by the ism map . for @xmath146  deg@xmath2 ,",
    "the results for @xmath158 are similar to those for @xmath133 .",
    "we have presented results for the most probable scenario in which there are rm contributions from the source , the igm , intervening galaxies , the ism , and observational errors .",
    "although the scenario is based on observations and simulations , one may consider alternatives .",
    "particularly , it would be insightful to consider the case in which the rm of filaments is insignificant .",
    "therefore , in this subsection we consider other models for rm contributions .",
    "we expect that the models themselves will be improved with future observations .",

    "if we adopt @xmath184 , we find @xmath185 @xmath13 for sources with @xmath95 , which is still insignificant and does not change our main results .",
    "if the rm due to the igmf is close to zero and the intrinsic rm dominates the observed rms , the intrinsic rm is required to be @xmath186 times larger than the value we adopted .",
    "the results of this case are shown in figure  [ f5 ] . in this case",
    ", we would clearly see a @xmath187 relation in the standard deviation and the pdf of the rrm map .",
    "the sf of the rrm map would also decrease with increasing @xmath3 , showing a flat profile .",
    "such a strong dependence of rm on redshift is , however , not observed @xcite , and the resultant standard deviation of @xmath188 for @xmath189 is too large compared with the possible range described above .",
    "these results suggest that if intrinsic rms dominate the observed rms , the standard deviation of rm should follow @xmath190 and @xmath191 with @xmath192 , i.e. , sources at higher - redshifts will have larger rms . note that observed intrinsic rms",
    "are a result of competition between source evolution and depolarization .",
    "the actual dependence will be related to the effects of active galactic nuclei and star - formation , the masses of galaxies , and the bias of observations . since in our approach the redshift dependence of @xmath39 is essential for reducing the contribution of int rms from observed rms , further studies of radio sources , e.g. ultra - high resolution observations with ska , are of crucial importance .",

    "since the galactic contribution is mostly removed by a high - pass filter , in this case we obtain a very small standard deviation and a narrow pdf for the rrm map ( figure  [ f6 ] ) , both of which show a @xmath187 relation caused by the int map .",
    "the sf of the com map will go down to @xmath195 @xmath13 at a scale of @xmath167 .",
    "such a decline is not observed @xcite , although present observations still have large uncertainties at sub degree scales .",
    "the sf at sub degree scales could begin to be studied with the askap .",
    "note that the estimation of the rm due to the igmf would be easier if we were to consider the north galactic pole , since the average and the standard deviation are then both smaller @xcite .",
    "a more critical change to the ism model would be to increase the power at small scales .",
    "if the ism component has significant rms at scales less than @xmath167 , a high - pass filter will fail to remove the ism component from the rrm map .",
    "actually , it has been suggested that there are small - scale structures in rm in the galactic plane ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we have adopted the milky way model of @xcite , which is based on observed properties of turbulence .",
    "the model has incorporated small - scale structures caused by turbulence , and the power of which in small scales ( @xmath18 ) is negligibly small toward high galactic latitudes .",
    "future observations will provide denser rm grids , and may allow to study small - scale galactic rm fluctuations not originating from turbulence toward high galactic latitudes .",
    "recently , a new method using millisecond pulsars in globular clusters has been proposed to study small - scale ism magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "@xcite have inferred 0.1 @xmath10 g fluctuations on parsec scales toward high galactic latitudes , which is about one order of magnitude weaker than the strength of turbulent magnetic fields adopted by @xcite . this may be evidence that sub pc - scale galactic magnetic fields are not predominant , but does not dramatically alter the power spectrum and the structure function of rms in our model .",

[ f7 ] ]    the measured properties of the sf of rm depends on the reliability of the source count and error estimates .",
    "we have assumed that the source count and error estimates obtained from observations are reliable .",
    "discussion about the reliability of these measurements is beyond the scope of our work , nevertheless , these effects can be considered by showing cases for large errors .",
    "figure  [ f7 ] shows the cases for @xmath24 , 1.0 , 3.0 , and 5.0 @xmath13 .",
    "since the err map has a white - noise spectrum in fourier space , it can not be fully removed by a high - pass filter . as a result",
    ", we see a broader pdf and a larger standard deviation of the rrm map compared with the igm map .",
    "errors change the scales at which intrinsic and galactic contributions dominate . generally speaking",
    ", the apparent scales of intrinsic and galactic contributions could change if the error rm is comparable to the observed rm itself .",
    "an instructive example can be seen in figure 5 of @xcite in which they demonstrated how errors with powers of 0.4 - 8 times the data values change the slope of the sf .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that errors will become sufficiently small compared to intrinsic and galactic contributions in future observations",
    ".    a possible way to reduce the error term would be a further selection of sources that have relatively small errors , although this will reduce the number of sources and will increase statistical uncertainties .",
    "the fraction of the sources that satisfy a given level of rm errors is not well - understood .",
    "further study of this fraction will be helpful to identify a sweet spot between the number of sources and the amplitude of errors .",
    "finally , we consider how our results can probe the possible nature of the igmf .",
    "first of all , we have adopted a model of the igmf that has theoretical uncertainties of up to a factor of a few both on the strength and coherence length @xcite .",
    "there are also igmf models that we have not considered ( see @xcite and references therein ) , which could have different strengths and different coherence lengths of the igmf in filaments compared to that used here .",
    "if we suppose that an rrm map derived according to the approach in this paper can meaningfully recover the average , standard deviation and sf of the igm map from observed data , the nature of the igmf can be constrained as follows . since recent cosmological simulations share a broad agreement on the density structure of the igm , we can evaluate an electron density and depth of a filament , and the number of filaments along the los .",
    "thus , the standard deviation of the rrm map jointly constrains the strength and coherence length of the igmf ( e.g. , using eq .",
    "( 11 ) of * ? ? ?",
    "models predicting peculiarly small or large igmf strengths could be ruled out from such constraints .",
    "the degeneracy between the strength and the coherence length of the igmf in rm could be broken using the sf .",
    "for instance , if the sf starts to decrease around an angular separation of @xmath1 , this implies a coherence length of the igmf in filaments of several hundred kpc @xcite .",
    "in contrast , an igmf with a larger coherence length should show a decline of the sf at scales larger than @xmath169 , and such a decline could be detected with askap ( @xmath197  deg@xmath2 ) .",
    "but if the igmf is much weaker and/or the coherence length is much shorter than several hundred kpc , we would see a flat sf at @xmath169 , and such behavior could only be studied with the ska ( @xmath198  deg@xmath2 ) .    note that if the local group igmf has a significant rm , this would have uniform distribution within the considered fov since the angular size of the corresponding coherence length would be @xmath195 degrees @xcite .",
    "hence the rm of the local group should mainly contribute to the average observed rm , and a high - pass filter will reduce it in the rrm map . to study the rm of the local group , we thus need to consider a much wider fov and need to investigate very large - scale coherent rm structures .    finally ,",
    "if the rrm map truly reproduces the igm map , reconstructed rm data should show a monotonic increase as a function of @xmath3 and should show a saturation for large @xmath3 ( figure  [ f1 ] ) .",
    "in addition , since the igm map traces the large - scale distribution of matter @xcite , reconstructed rms should have a correlation with tracers of the large - scale structure such as the number density of galaxies , the x - ray surface brightness of the igm and the sunyaev - zeldovich effect against the cosmic microwave background .",
    "such correlations would confirm the discovery of faraday rotation due to the igmf in the cosmic web , and will be considered in future studies .",
    "in this paper we have demonstrated an approach for estimating the faraday rotation measure ( rm ) produced by the intergalactic magnetic field ( igmf ) , in which we have incorporated models of rm for polarized sources , the igm , intervening galaxies , the ism and observational errors .",
    "we have adopted a scenario in which the observer - flame rm of sources decreases with redshift by @xmath41 and the observer - flame rm of the igmf through filaments accumulates with redshift by the manner predicted from cosmological simulations ( figure [ f1 ] ) .",
    "we considered a @xmath0 field - of - view toward the galactic caps , motivated by previous observational studies .",
    "we found that a high - pass filter is quite effective at removing the galactic contribution from the observed rms .",
    "reductions of rms @xmath199 rad m@xmath2 caused by intervening galaxies and observational errors more than a few rad m@xmath2 are both critical for the study of the rm due to the igmf . after selecting a half of observed sources",
    "toward which sightlines do not contain intervening galaxies , and assuming that rm errors are less than a few rad m@xmath2 , our approach allows us to estimate the standard deviation of the rm due to the igmf with errors less than @xmath200 and @xmath201 if source densities per square degree of @xmath202 and @xmath145  deg@xmath2 are available , respectively . the second - order structure function of the rm due to the igmf will be able to be studied with errors less than @xmath170 down to scales of @xmath169 if we can achieve a sky density @xmath203  deg@xmath2 for polarized extragalactic radio sources in the ska era .",
