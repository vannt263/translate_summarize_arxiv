    "h. karcher @xcite proved the existence of the first complete , embedded , doubly  periodic minimal surface to be found since h. scherk s classical example , which dates from 1835 .",
    "we denote karcher s surface by @xmath1 ( see figure [ fig : intro_images ] , left ) . following this discovery , wei @xcite constructed an embedded , doubly  periodic surface of genus two by adding a handle to @xmath1 ( figure [ fig : intro_images ] , center ) .",
    "we describe a new embedded , genus two surface that results from adding a different type of handle to @xmath1 ( figure [ fig : intro_images ] , right ) , and outline the differences between these two genus two surfaces .",
    "in addition , we construct three collections of new , embedded surfaces of genus three that result from adding either two handles of the same type ( figure [ fig:2k+1pp_image ] ) or two handles of different type ( figure [ fig : intro_images2 ] ) .    using a technique discovered by karcher - polthier @xcite to reduce the number of periods to be considered , we are able to add ends to the fundamental piece of each surface presented without increasing the dimension of the period problems , thereby producing countably many different families of new , embedded examples for each of the handle types shown in figures [ fig : intro_images ] and [ fig:2k+1pp_image ] .",
    "the existence proofs for the genus two surfaces require solving one  dimensional period problems , and the existence proofs for the genus three surfaces require solving either one  dimensional or two  dimensional period problems , depending on the types of handles we choose . when the period problem is one  dimensional ( as for surfaces in figures [ fig : intro_images ] and [ fig:2k+1pp_image ] )",
    ", we use the intermediate value theorem to solve it . when it is two  dimensional ( as for surfaces in figure [ fig : intro_images2 ] )",
    ", we achieve a solution by using a mapping degree argument , a kind of generalization of the intermediate value theorem .",
    "we find that in the two cases of genus three surfaces with four ends and handles of the same type the period problems have no solution . in these exceptional cases",
    "we demonstrate a natural geometric obstruction to existence , an obstruction that disappears when more ends are added to the surfaces .",

    "the three planes divide the surface into eight pieces .",
    "each piece is bounded by planar geodesic curves , and has one end .",
    "since all the surfaces we will discuss here share these planar symmetries we will focus on one eighth of these surfaces and draw sketches of this portion only .",
    "the first modification of @xmath1 was made by f. wei @xcite , who constructed a one  parameter family of genus two examples @xmath2 by adding a single handle over one of the two saddle points of @xmath1 ( see figures [ fig : intro_images ] , center and [ fig : intro_sketches ] , center ) .",
    "recently it was discovered by karcher ",
    "polthier @xcite ( and the second author independently ) that another modification of @xmath1 was possible .",
    "this new surface @xmath3 results from adding a handle to @xmath1 in a different direction , thereby producing another doubly  periodic , embedded minimal surface of genus two ( see figures [ fig : intro_images ] , right and [ fig : intro_sketches ] , right ) .",
    "* remark on notation : * _ in order to distinguish the two genus two surfaces , we view @xmath1 from above , imagining that @xmath1 projects into the black squares of an infinite , black and white checkerboard pattern , with the vertical straight lines projecting onto the corners of these squares ( see figure [ fig : wt_top_view ] ) . from this perspective , the handles added by wei project into the black regions while the new handles project into the white ones . in both cases , the additional handles modify the checker board pattern into a tiling made up of rectangular regions as is indicated in figure [ fig : wt_top_view ] . we denote the handles over the black squares with a superscript `  ' , and those over the white squares with a superscript ` + ' .",
    "hence , in this notation , wei s genus two surface is referred to as @xmath2 , and the new surface discussed in section [ sec : m_k+ ] is @xmath3 .",
    "each surface discussed in this paper lies in a one  parameter family of embedded surfaces .",
    "since we are interested in the topological qualities of these surfaces , our notation thoughout the paper will not reflect the specific surface in the family .",
    "the subscript indexes the number of ends on each eighth of the surface . _",
    "both @xmath3 and @xmath2 have smaller symmetry groups than karcher s original surface ; in particular , the vertical straight lines of @xmath1 are eliminated .",
    "the question `` is it possible to add handles to @xmath1 and preserve the original symmetries ? '' is a natural one .",
    "we might , for example , want to add either a ` + ' or a `  ' type handle and preserve the vertical straight lines .",
    "rotation about these lines ( via the schwarz reflection principle , theorem [ thm : schwarz ] ) places another handle over the other saddle point of @xmath1 .",
    "this would result in a genus three surface with four scherk ends .",
    "it is easy to imagine such a surface for either type of handle .",
    "indeed , the suggested conjugate contour of one eighth of either surface supports a plateau solution that is a jenkins - serrin graph @xcite .",
    "so a minimal surface with boundary exists with the desired shape , but we only know that certain bounding planar curves lie in parallel planes .",
    "we then must solve the one  dimensional period problem or , equivalently , show that the parallel planes coincide .",
    "we will prove that neither of these period problems are solvable , and we do so by finding natural obstructions on the corresponding conjugate surfaces .",
    "understanding these obstructions , we realize it is possible to overcome them by adding more ends to each surface .",
    "because of the desired symmetries , each eighth of these surfaces must have an odd number of ends .",
    "indexing by this number , we show the period problems are never solved on @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and that for @xmath10 the period problems associated to @xmath11 and @xmath12 are solvable .",
    "the superscript indicates the types of handles added to @xmath1",
    ". see figure [ fig:2k+1pp_image ] .    with the addition of each new end , there is a new associated period . in section [ sec : m_k ] , we describe a technique found by karcher ",
    "polthier @xcite that shows that one may simultaneously solve these end periods .",
    "specifically , they observed that a certain simple restriction on the conjugate contours ensures these end periods are all zero .",
    "moreover , this restriction leaves an ample number of parameters free to allow us to adjust the other periods associated with the new handles .    instead of adding two handles of the same type to @xmath1",
    ", we may also consider surfaces which have two handles of different types .",
    "this produces a family of genus three surfaces that no longer have the straight line symmetries of @xmath1 . without this additional symmetry ,",
    "the period problem resulting from the new handles is two  dimensional .",
    "the third author s experience with two  dimensional period problems @xcite suggested that these period problems may be solvable .",
    "we prove in section [ sec : m_k+- ] that @xmath13 with four scherk  type ends exists .",
    "generalizing the examples @xmath13 to have @xmath14 scherk  type ends for @xmath15 , numerical evidence suggests the existence of @xmath16 for @xmath15 ( see figure [ fig : intro_images2 ] ) .",

    "the first part of lemma 4.1 is intended only to be an intuitive aid , saying that `` each collection of surfaces results from adding ends and handles to @xmath1 '' . however , a rigorous proof is required for the statement that `` the period problems arising from the additional ends are all solved by requiring @xmath305 '' .    for each surface , we always begin by choosing one - eighth of the original fundamental piece of the surface .",
    "this one - eighth piece is bounded by planar geodesics , and its conjugate surface is bounded by portions of lines . before we consider any period problems , we must first establish existence of this conjugate surface , which then implies the existence of the original one - eighth piece ( without solving for period problems yet ) .",
    "the conjugate pieces exist because they are jenkins - serrin graphs . in all the cases we consider , they are jenkins - serrin graphs over a rectangle , and the boundary data is a finite constant over each of three sides of the boundary of the rectangle . on the fourth side , the boundary data alternates between @xmath51 and @xmath52 along adjacent intervals .",

    "following the proof in @xcite , p 334 , @xmath314 is the limit of a subsequence of minimal graphs @xmath318 over int(@xmath41 ) . the minimal graphs @xmath319 are determined by replacing the boundary condition @xmath51 by @xmath320 on each @xmath44 , replacing the boundary condition @xmath52 by @xmath321 on each @xmath45 , and leaving the boundary data on @xmath322 unchanged .",

    "( this is equivalent to showing that the normal vectors of the graphs converge uniformly over @xmath333 . )",
    "once we know that first derivatives of @xmath319 also converge uniformly , the arguments in the proof of lemma 3.2 and the remark following it in @xcite can be applied : using the three - point condition as in @xcite , we can find a subsequence @xmath351 of the @xmath346 which converge uniformly to @xmath347 on @xmath352 .",
    "since the functions @xmath353 are harmonic , and hence the functions @xmath354 always attain their maximums on @xmath352 , we conclude that @xmath355 uniformly on all of @xmath349 .",
