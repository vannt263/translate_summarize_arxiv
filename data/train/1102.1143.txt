    "electron transport in mesoscopic structures is usually well described within the mean - field approaches that include electron - electron interaction at various levels of sophistication.@xcite the simplest model accounting for classical coulomb repulsion between charged particles is the hartree approach . while being the simplest it is able to capture many transport phenomena that are inaccessible for the single - particle approaches or the thomas - fermi model . for example , conductance statistics in open quantum dots at low temperatures was revealed to be governed by the pinning effect of resonant energy levels.@xcite however many phenomena observed experimentally demand further improvements of theoretical study such as inclusion of spin and of the exchange interaction .",
    "the hallmark example is the coulomb blockade effect in quantum dots.@xcite it is usually described by a phenomenological approach involving a set of adjustable parameters along with completely disregarding the dot geometry.@xcite as a result it is difficult to relate the employed parameter sets to the physical processes they represent and to the device topology studied . a model that accounts for both the dot and lead geometry and treats the whole device on the same footing in the coulomb blockade regime as well as accesses direct quantitative description of coulomb blockade in dots of general geometry has not been accomplished yet .",
    "such a model would allow one to capture the microscopic physics of electron transport in the quantum dots .",
    "attempts to address coulomb blockade , at least at a model level , are made within time - dependent density - functional theory ( dft).@xcite electron transport is considered to be intrinsically non - equilibrium that evolve in time and coulomb blockade occurs in the long - time limit as a periodic sequence of charging and discharging events .",
    "electron tunneling through the interacting many - body system can also be considered within gw - approximation in the framework of non - equilibrium green s functions ( negf).@xcite by introducing quasi - particle electronic structure it brings substantial improvements in comparison to standard negf and agreement with experiment becomes better.@xcite however , whether time - dependence is necessary for steady - state regime and whether electronic correlations along are responsible for coulomb blockade are not clear .",
    "this theoretical study shows that inclusion of the exchange interaction in the hartree - fock approximation to the self - consistent solution of the shrdinger equation does allow one to capture the coulomb blockade effect of electron transport .",
    "there is no need in the correlation effects , at least , for qualitative agreement .",
    "the model is implemented within the green s function formalism that is well suited to the description of structures of arbitrary geometries.@xcite it was previously tested ( without the fock term ) on different low - dimensional structures and the results obtained were in good agreement with experimental data and other theoretical models.@xcite an attempt to account for exchange interaction was previously done using dft in the local density approximation .",
    "the conductance however was found to be untrustworthy : it did not reproduce the 0.7 anomaly measured in almost every experiment on quantum point contacts.@xcite this is because the local density approximation of dft lacks the derivative discontinuity and can not fundamentally address the transport regime when quantization of electron charge occurs.@xcite another approach that accounts for the exchange interaction _ exactly _ is the hartree - fock one .",
    "it relies essentially on the density matrix that takes into account the phase relations between different electron states .",
    "accounting for the exchange interaction by the density matrix brings qualitatively new physics in comparison to the hartree approach . in the regime of a single channel open for transmission ,",
    "the resonant levels in few - electron quantum dots become ordered at the fermi energy and conductance oscillations narrow .",
    "both of these phenomena are indicative of suppressed screening .",
    "as potential barriers are imposed between the dot and leads , the number of electrons in the dot becomes quantized and the conductance shows well defined peaks . to identify the transport regime",
    "a different model based on the orthodox theory of coulomb blockade@xcite was implemented and calculations for similar but isolated dot were performed .",

    "it was shown that hartree and dft approaches provide qualitatively similar description of the electron transport in open quantum dots.@xcite using the fact that dft predicts spin polarization in a quantum wire similarly to the hartree - fock approximation@xcite we may conclude that all these approaches are qualitatively equivalent for description of electron transport in the strong coupling regime @xmath51 . however , in the opposite regime of weak coupling , the hartree approximation is not accurate .",
    "that regime is governed by coulomb blockade physics when the electron density is quantized and therefore the hartree - fock approach should be rather employed .",
    "incorporating the density matrix into the theory is essential because no features of charge quantization and cb are found otherwise .",
    "even though the exchange interactions might be treated within dft in the local density approximation or slater approximation@xcite they fail to address charge quantization and cb physics .    the important feature of the present model is absence of any adjustable parameters . in this respect",
    ", it might be considered as a first - principle approach .",
    "the models existing in literature use adjustable charging parameters and/or disregard degrees of freedom of the scattering region,@xcite e.g. the dot is treated as a zero - dimensional region.@xcite such simplifications make it difficult to relate the employed parameter set with physical processes they represent and , as a result , the reliability of the results obtained is questionable .",
    "note that some studies consider the device geometry explicitly but still rely on some assumption heavily affecting the obtained results .",
    "for example , slight modification of the landauer formula allowed authors of ref . to address cb even though amplitude of successive conductance peaks fell off exponentially , which disagree with experimental fundings .",
    "while the hartree - fock model appears to be powerful for the description of electron transport it is still a mean - field approximation to an interacting many - electron system .",
    "the model misses correlation effects that stem from the fact that true ground state wave function is not a single slater determinant.@xcite electron correlation interactions might play an important role as it is shown for the kondo effect and others.@xcite it worth noting also that the hartree - fock model is known to underestimate electron screening.@xcite a possible improvement might be accomplished by treating electrons participating in transport by some exact method while using the mean - field approach for others .",
    "numerical calculations in the hartree - fock approach demand much larger computer resources in comparison to the hartree approximation .",
    "the matrix dimensions scale as @xmath52 and @xmath53 for these approaches , respectively ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the numbers of sites in transverse and longitudinal directions , respectively ) . in practice",
    ", the transverse space coordinate is transformed into momentum space where several basis functions are used.@xcite convergence of the self - consistent solution in the hartree - fock approach performs generally worse , especially when lead - to - dot coupling decreases substantially and @xmath44 .",
    "a possible improvement might be done as suggested in ref . ,",
    "where the fermi - dirac distribution function in eq .",
    "is replaced by the gibbs distribution .    finally , it worth noting that the similar results were obtained for the open quantum dots of different geometries .",
    "the numerical calculations were also performed for the quantum point contacts , where conductance plateaus were found to be somewhat larger if the hartree - fock approach employed .",
    "this signals reduced energy level pinning effect in accord with results presented above .",
    "the hartree - fock approximation combined with the green s function formalism represents an unified and powerful approach to electron transport that implicitly takes the interplay between the statistical and quantum - mechanical properties of the confined geometries into account .",
    "this allows one to address the coulomb blockade physics that dominates electron transport in quantum dots weakly coupled to the leads .",
    "this is confirmed by comparison with the master equation approach for equivalent closed dots : the number of electrons inside the dot is quantized and the conductance shows a peak each time the electron number changes by one ( disregarding spin ) .",
    "the conductance peaks are caused by electron resonant transmission when corresponding energy levels cross the fermi energy .",
    "the present study is limited to the case of spinless electrons .",
    "work is in progress to include the effect of the spin in order to revisit magnetic bound state formation in the quantum point contacts .",
    "it is also interesting to examine multiple periodicity in the aharonov - bohm interferometers as well as the effect of mesoscopic cb observed in the recent experiment@xcite on the open quantum dot .",

    "zozoulenko and g. kirczenow for discussions and critical reading of the manuscript .",
    "in order to understand why the hartree - fock approach eliminates self - interaction error , let us consider a system of @xmath33 electrons each described by the hamiltonian @xmath56 .",
    "the ground state energy reads @xmath57 where @xmath58 represents coulomb interaction between electrons in state @xmath59 and @xmath60 @xmath61 and @xmath62 represents the effect of antisymmetrization , i.e. exchange , @xmath63 since @xmath64 electron in state @xmath59 does not self interact .",
