    "many combinatorial optimization problems are @xmath0-hard , and the theory of @xmath0-completeness has reduced hopes that @xmath0-_hard _ problems can be solved within polynomial bounded computation times",
    ". nevertheless , sub - optimal solutions are sometimes easy to find .",
    "consequently , there is much interest in approximation and heuristic algorithms that can find near optimal solutions within reasonable running time .",
    "heuristic algorithms are typically among the best strategies in terms of efficiency and solution quality for problems of realistic size and complexity .",
    "in contrast to individual heuristic algorithms that are designed to solve a specific problem , meta - heuristics are strategic problem solving frameworks that can be adapted to solve a wide variety of problems .",
    "meta - heuristic algorithms are widely recognized as one of the most practical approaches for combinatorial optimization problems .",
    "the most representative meta - heuristics include genetic algorithms , simulated annealing , tabu search and ant colony .",
    "useful references regarding meta - heuristic methods can be found in @xcite .    _",
    "the generalized traveling salesman problem ( gtsp ) _ has been introduced in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "gtsp _ has several applications to location and telecommunication problems .",
    "more information on these problems and their applications can be found in @xcite .",
    "several approaches were considered for solving the _ gtsp _ : a branch - and - cut algorithm for _ symmetric gtsp _ is described and analyzed in @xcite , in @xcite is given a lagrangian - based approach for _ asymmetric gtsp _ , in @xcite is described a random - key genetic algorithm for the _ gtsp _ , in @xcite it is proposed an efficient composite heuristic for the _ symmetric gtsp _ etc .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide an exact algorithm for the _ gtsp _ as well as an effective meta - heuristic algorithm for the problem .",
    "the proposed meta - heuristic is a modified version of _ ant colony system ( acs)_. introduced in ( @xcite ) , _ ant system _ is a heuristic algorithm inspired by the observation of real ant colonies .",
    "_ acs _ is used to solve hard combinatorial optimization problems including the _ traveling salesman problem ( tsp)_.",
    "let @xmath1 be an @xmath2-node undirected graph whose edges are associated with non - negative costs .",
    "we will assume w.l.o.g . that @xmath3 is a complete graph",
    "( if there is no edge between two nodes , we can add it with an infinite cost ) .",
    "let @xmath4 be a partition of @xmath5 into @xmath6 subsets called _ clusters _",
    "( i.e. @xmath7 and @xmath8 for all @xmath9 ) .",
    "we denote the cost of an edge @xmath10 by @xmath11 .",
    "the _ generalized traveling salesman problem _",
    "( _ gtsp _ ) asks for finding a minimum - cost tour @xmath12 spanning a subset of nodes such that @xmath12 contains exactly one node from each cluster @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "the problem involves two related decisions : choosing a node subset @xmath15 , such that @xmath16 , for all @xmath17 and finding a minimum cost hamiltonian cycle in the subgraph of @xmath3 induced by @xmath18 .",
    "such a cycle is called a _",
    "hamiltonian tour_. the _ gtsp _ is called _ symmetric _ if and only if the equality @xmath19 holds for every @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the cost function associated to the edges of @xmath3 .",
    "in this section , we present an algorithm that finds an exact solution to the _ gtsp_.    given a sequence @xmath22 in which the clusters are visited , we want to find the best feasible hamiltonian tour @xmath23 ( w.r.t cost minimization ) , visiting the clusters according to the given sequence .",
    "this can be done in polynomial time by solving @xmath24 shortest path problems as described below .",
    "we construct a layered network , denoted by ln , having @xmath25 layers corresponding to the clusters @xmath26 and in addition we duplicate the cluster @xmath27 .",
    "the layered network contains all the nodes of @xmath3 plus some extra nodes @xmath28 for each @xmath29 .",
    "there is an arc @xmath30 for each @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) , having the cost @xmath11 and an arc @xmath34 , @xmath35 , ( @xmath36 ) having cost @xmath37 .",
    "moreover , there is an arc @xmath38 for each @xmath39 and @xmath40 having cost @xmath41 .    for",
    "any given @xmath29 , we consider paths from @xmath42 to @xmath43 , @xmath44 , that visits exactly two nodes from each cluster @xmath45 , hence it gives a feasible hamiltonian tour .",
    "conversely , every hamiltonian tour visiting the clusters according to the sequence @xmath22 corresponds to a path in the layered network from a certain node @xmath29 to @xmath44 .    therefore the best ( w.r.t cost minimization ) hamiltonian tour @xmath23 visiting the clusters in a given sequence can be found by determining all the shortest paths from each @xmath46 to each @xmath44 with the property that visits exactly one node from cluster .",
    "the overall time complexity is then @xmath47 , i.e. @xmath48 in the worst case .",
    "we can reduce the time by choosing @xmath49 as the cluster with minimum cardinality .",
    "it should be noted that the above procedure leads to an @xmath50 time exact algorithm for the _ gtsp _ , obtained by trying all the @xmath51 possible cluster sequences .",
    "therefore we have established the following result : the above procedure provides an exact solution to the _ gstp _ in @xmath50 time , where @xmath2 is the number of nodes , @xmath52 is the number of edges and @xmath6 is the number of clusters in the input graph .",
    "clearly , the algorithm presented is an exponential time algorithm unless the number of clusters @xmath6 is fixed .",
    "_ ant system _ proposed in @xcite is a multi - agent approach used for various combinatorial optimization problems .",
    "the algorithms were inspired by the observation of real ant colonies .",
    "an ant can find shortest paths between food sources and a nest . while walking from food sources to the nest and vice versa , ants deposit on the ground a substance called pheromone , forming a pheromone trail .",
    "ants can smell pheromone and , when choosing their way , they tend to choose paths marked by stronger pheromone concentrations . it has been shown that this pheromone trail following behavior employed by a colony of ants can lead to the emergence of shortest paths .    when an obstacle breaks the path ants try to get around the obstacle randomly choosing either way . if the two paths encircling the obstacle have the different length , more ants pass the shorter route on their continuous pendulum motion between the nest points in particular time interval .",
    "while each ant keeps marking its way by pheromone the shorter route attracts more pheromone concentrations and consequently more and more ants choose this route .",
    "this feedback finally leads to a stage where the entire ant colony uses the shortest path .",
    "there are many variations of the ant colony optimization applied on various classical problems .",
    "_ ant system _ make use of simple agents called ants which iterative construct candidate solution to a combinatorial optimization problem .",
    "the ants solution construction is guided by pheromone trails and problem dependent heuristic information .",
    "an individual ant constructs candidate solutions by starting with an empty solution and then iterative adding solution components until a complete candidate solution is generated .",
    "each point at which an ant has to decide which solution component to add to its current partial solution is called a choice point .",
    "after the solution construction is completed , the ants give feedback on the solutions they have constructed by depositing pheromone on solution components which they have used in their solution .",
    "solution components which are part of better solutions or are used by many ants will receive a higher amount of pheromone and , hence , will more likely be used by the ants in future iterations of the algorithm . to avoid the search getting stuck ,",
    "typically before the pheromone trails get reinforced , all pheromone trails are decreased by a factor .",
    "_ ant colony system _ ( _ acs _ ) was developed to improve _ ant system _ , making it more efficient and robust .",
    "_ ant colony system _ works as follows : _ m _ ants are initially positioned on n nodes chosen according to some initialization rule , for example randomly .",
    "each ant builds a tour by repeatedly applying a stochastic greedy rule - the state transition rule . while constructing its tour",
    ", an ant also modifies the amount of pheromone on the visited edges by applying the local updating rule .",
    "once all ants have terminated their tour , the amount of pheromone on edges is modified again by applying the global updating rule . as was the case in ant system ,",
    "ants are guided , in building their tours by both heuristic information and by pheromone information : an edge with a high amount of pheromone is a very desirable choice .",
    "the pheromone updating rules are designed so that they tend to give more pheromone to edges which should be visited by ants .",
    "the ants solutions are not guaranteed to be optimal with respect to local changes and hence may be further improved using local search methods .",
    "based on this observation , the best performance are obtained using hybrid algorithms combining probabilistic solution construction by a colony of ants with local search algorithms as 2 - 3 opt , tabu - search etc . in such hybrid algorithms ,",
    "the ants can be seen as guiding the local search by constructing promising initial solutions , because ants preferably use solution components which , earlier in the search , have been contained in good locally optimal solutions .",
    "an _ ant colony system _ for the _ gtsp _ it is introduced . in order to enforces the construction of a valid solution used in _ acs _ a new algorithm called _ reinforcing ant colony system _ _ ( racs ) _ it is elaborated with a new pheromone rule as in @xcite and pheromone evaporation technique as in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath53 denote the node @xmath54 from the cluster @xmath55 .",
    "the _ racs _",
    "algorithm for the _ gtsp _ works as follows :    * initially the ants are placed in the nodes of the graph , choosing randomly the _ clusters _ and also a random node from the chosen cluster * at iteration @xmath56 every ant moves to a new node from an unvisited _ cluster _ and the parameters controlling the algorithm are updated . *",
    "each edge is labeled by a trail intensity .",
    "let @xmath57 represent the trail intensity of the edge @xmath30 at time @xmath58 .",
    "an ant decides which node is the next move with a probability that is based on the distance to that node ( i.e. cost of the edge ) and the amount of trail intensity on the connecting edge .",
    "the inverse of distance from a node to the next node is known as the _ visibility _ , @xmath59 .",
    "* at each time unit evaporation takes place .",
    "this is to stop the intensity trails increasing unbounded .",
    "the rate evaporation is denoted by @xmath60 , and its value is between 0 and 1 . in order to stop ants visiting the same _ cluster _ in the same tour a tabu list is maintained .",
    "this prevents ants visiting _ clusters _ they have previously visited .",
    "the ant tabu list is cleared after each completed tour .",
    "* to favor the selection of an edge that has a high pheromone value , @xmath61 , and high visibility value , @xmath62 a probability function @xmath63 is considered .",
    "@xmath64 are the unvisited neighbors of node @xmath65 by ant @xmath66 and @xmath67 , being the node @xmath54 from the unvisited cluster @xmath55 .",
    "this probability function is defined as follows : + @xmath68 [ \\eta_{iu}(t)]^{\\beta } } { \\sigma_{o\\in { j^{k}}_{i}}[\\tau_{io}(t ) ] [ \\eta_{io}(t)]^{\\beta } } , \\ ] ] + where @xmath69 is a parameter used for tuning the relative importance of edge cost in selecting the next node .",
    "@xmath63 is the probability of choosing @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the next node , if @xmath72 ( the current node is @xmath65 ) . if @xmath73 the next node @xmath74 is chosen as follows : @xmath75}^{\\beta}\\ } , \\ ] ] where @xmath76 is a random variable uniformly distributed over @xmath77 $ ] and @xmath78 is a parameter similar to the temperature in simulated annealing , @xmath79 .",
    "* after each transition the trail intensity is updated using the correction rule from @xcite : + @xmath80 + where @xmath81 is the cost of the best tour .",
    "* in _ ant colony system _ only the ant that generate the best tour is allowed to _ globally _ update the pheromone .",
    "the global update rule is applied to the edges belonging to the _",
    "best tour_. the correction rule is + @xmath82 + where @xmath83 is the inverse cost of the best tour . * in order to avoid stagnation we used the pheromone evaporation technique introduced in @xcite . when the pheromone trail is over an upper bound @xmath84 , the pheromone trail is re - initialized .",
    "the pheromone evaporation is used after the global pheromone update rule .",
    "the _ racs _ algorithm computes for a given time @xmath85 a sub - optimal solution , the optimal solution if it is possible and can be stated as follows in the pseudo - code description .",
    "pheromone quantity ; after several iterations performed by each ant from the nest , the solution is visible .",
    "the second picture shows a solution of _ generalized traveling salesman problem _",

    "[ fig : figura ] . at the beginning , the ants are in their nest and will start to search food in a specific area . assuming that each cluster has specific food and the ants are capable to recognize this , they will choose each time a different cluster .",

    "[ fig : figura ] .    to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm ,",
    "the _ racs _ was compared to the basic _ acs _ algorithm for _ gtsp _ and furthermore to other heuristics from literature : _ nearest neighbor ( nn ) _ , a composite heuristic @xmath86 and a _ random key - genetic algorithm _ @xcite . the numerical experiments that compare _ racs _ with other heuristics used problems from _ tsp _ library @xcite .",
    "_ tsplib _ provides optimal objective values for each of the problems .",
    "several problems with euclidean distances have been considered .",
    "the exact algorithm proposed in section 3 , is clearly outperformed by heuristics including _ racs _ , because his running time is exponential , while heuristics including _ racs _ are polynomial time algorithms and provide good sub - optimal solution for reasonable sizes of the problem .    to divide the set of nodes into subsets we used the procedure proposed in @xcite .",
    "this procedure sets the number of clusters @xmath87 $ ] , identifies the @xmath52 farthest nodes from each other , called centers , and assigns each remaining node to its nearest center .",

    "the decimal values can be treated as parameters and can be changed if it is necessary .",
    "the parameters for the algorithm are critical as in all other ant systems .",
