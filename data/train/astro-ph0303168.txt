    "the calculation of the tensor perturbations in braneworld cosmology is more involved than that of the scalar perturbations , because the former extend into the bulk @xcite .",
    "the equation of motion for the tensor modes is derived from the linear perturbations of the bulk field equations , but the linearly perturbed junction conditions impose a boundary condition on the modes at the location of the brane .",
    "a detailed study of these equations is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "however , the model we have considered predicts a potentially detectable signal of long  wavelength gravitational waves in the absence of the gauss  bonnet term @xcite and it would be interesting to investigate whether such a prediction is sensitive to the gauss  bonnet contribution .",
    "there is also the related question of whether the relationship between the scalar and tensor spectra is altered . in general , the two spectra are not independent and are related through a `` consistency '' relation , where the ratio of the amplitudes of the tensor and scalar perturbations is uniquely determined by the spectral index of the tensor spectrum .",
    "such a relation represents a potentially observable signature of single - field inflationary models @xcite .",
    "it was recently shown that in a number of braneworld models , the consistency equation takes precisely the same form as that of standard inflationary cosmology @xcite .",
    "this raises the question of whether the gauss  bonnet contribution is able to lift the degeneracy .",
    "finally , we conclude by highlighting a further consequence of the gauss  bonnet contribution on braneworld inflation . in section 3.1",
    ", it was shown that at sufficiently high energies , the condition for inflation is that the pressure of matter on the brane should be negative , @xmath160 .",
    "this conclusion may have implications for cosmological models dominated by a tachyon field .",
    "following the work of sen in understanding the role of the tachyon condensate in string theory @xcite , there has been considerable interest recently in developing models of inflation driven by such a field , and a recent discussion of the prospects and problems associated with tachyon cosmology was presented by gibbons @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of a time ",
    "dependent and homogeneous tachyon field , @xmath161 , may be described by the effective lagrangian @xmath162^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath163 represents the tachyon potential .",
    "this implies that the pressure of such a field is given by @xmath164 and is _ negative  definite _ for a positive  definite potential , @xmath165 .",
    "thus , if we consider the tachyon as a degree of freedom on the brane , the above discussion indicates that a gauss  bonnet contribution may allow inflation to proceed at sufficiently high energies with only a very weak dependence on the functional form of the tachyon potential",
    ". it would be interesting to explore this possibility further .",
