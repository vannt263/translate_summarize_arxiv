    "powerful passivity based approaches are not developed for adaptive synchronization problems .    in this paper",
    "we consider the problem of master - slave ( leader - follower ) synchronization in a network of nonidentical systems in lurie form where system models can be split into linear and nonlinear parts .",
    "case of identical nodes is studied in  @xcite .",
    "linearity of interconnections is not assumed ; links between subsystems can also be nonlinear . in the contrary to known works on adaptive synchronization of networks ,",

    "it is also assumed that some plant parameters are unknown.the leader subsystem is assumed to be isolated and the control objective is to approach the trajectory of the leader subsystem by all other ones under conditions of uncertainty .",
