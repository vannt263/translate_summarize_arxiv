    "in  [ sec : gzk ] we discuss `` gzk neutrinos . ''",
    "if the sources of uhecrs are extra - galactic and the particles are indeed protons , then these particles lose energy by interacting with the cosmic microwave background photons @xcite .",
    "protons of energy exceeding the threshold for pion production , @xmath13  ev , lose most of their energy over a time short compared to the age of the universe ( the `` gzk effect '' ) .",

    "coherent radio cerenkov detectors , and possibly large air - shower detectors , will provide the large effective volume required for the detection of the `` gzk neutrinos '' @xcite .",

    "[ sec : fireball ] we present a brief discussion of the fireball model of grbs , and briefly present the arguments suggesting a connection between grbs and uhecr sources . in  [ sec:1e14 ] we show that production of 100  tev neutrinos in the region where grb @xmath9-rays are produced is a generic prediction of the fireball model .",
    "it is a direct consequence of the _ assumptions _ that energy is carried from the underlying engine , most likely a ( few ) solar mass black hole , as kinetic energy of protons and that @xmath9-rays are produced by synchrotron emission of shock accelerated particles .",
    "the detection of the predicted neutrino signal will therefore provide strong support for the validity of underlying model assumptions , which is difficult to obtain using photon observations ( due to the high optical depth in the vicinity of the grb `` engine '' ) .",
    "the predicted neutrino intensity , @xmath14 of the wb intensity bound , implies a detection of @xmath15 muon induced neutrino events per yr in a km - scale neutrino detector ( since these events should be correlated in time and direction with grb @xmath9-rays , the search for grb neutrinos is essentially background free ) .",
    "neutrinos may be produced also in other stages of fireball evolution , at energies different than 100  tev .",
    "the production of these neutrinos is dependent on additional model assumptions . as an example , we discuss in  [ sec : tev ] the production of tev neutrinos expected in the `` collapsar '' scenario , where grb progenitors are associated with the collapse of massive stars .",
    "the discussion of grb neutrino emission demonstrates that in addition to identifying the sources of uhecrs , high - energy neutrino telescopes can also provide a unique probe of the physics of these sources .",
    "moreover , detection of high energy neutrinos from extra - galactic sources may also provide information on fundamental neutrino properties @xcite .",
    "high energy neutrinos are expected to be produced in astrophysical sources by the decay of charged pions , which lead to the production of muon and electron neutrinos .",

    "up - going @xmath18 s , rather than @xmath19 s , would be a distinctive signature of such oscillations .",
    "detection of neutrinos from grbs could be used to test the simultaneity of neutrino and photon arrival to an accuracy of @xmath20 , checking the assumption of special relativity that photons and neutrinos have the same limiting speed .",
    "these observations would also test the weak equivalence principle , according to which photons and neutrinos should suffer the same time delay as they pass through a gravitational potential . with @xmath21 accuracy , a burst at @xmath22 would reveal a fractional difference in limiting speed of @xmath23 , and a fractional difference in gravitational time delay of order @xmath24 ( considering the galactic potential alone ) .",
    "previous applications of these ideas to supernova 1987a ( see @xcite for review ) , yielded much weaker upper limits : of order @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively .",
    "the essence of the challenge of accelerating particles to @xmath8  ev can be understood using the following simple arguments .",
    "consider an astrophysical source driving a flow of magnetized plasma , with characteristic magnetic field strength @xmath27 and velocity @xmath28 .",
    "imagine now a conducting wire encircling the source at radius r , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : acceleration ] .",
    "the potential generated by the moving plasma is given by the time derivative of the magnetic flux @xmath29 and is therefore given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "a proton which is allowed to be accelerated by this potential drop would reach energy    @xmath32 .",
    "the situation is somewhat more complicate in the case of a relativistic outflow , where @xmath33 . in this case",
    ", the proton is allowed to be accelerated only over a fraction of the radius @xmath34 , comparable to @xmath35 . to see this",
    ", one must realize that as the plasma expands , its magnetic field decreases , so the time available for acceleration corresponds to the time of expansion from @xmath34 to , say , @xmath36 . in the observer frame this time is @xmath37 , while in the plasma rest frame it is @xmath38 .",
    "thus , a proton moving with the magnetized plasma can be accelerated over a transverse distance @xmath39 .",
    "this sets a lower limit to the product of the magnetic field and source size , which is required to allow acceleration to @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "this constraint also sets a lower limit to the rate @xmath42 at which energy should be generated by the source .",
    "the magnetic field carries with it an energy density @xmath43 , and the flow therefore carries with it an energy flux @xmath44 ( some energy is carried also as plasma kinetic energy ) , which implies @xmath45 and therefore @xmath46 only two types of sources are known to satisfy this requirement .",
    "the brightest steady sources are active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . for them",
    "@xmath47 is typically between 3 and 10 , implying @xmath48 , which may be satisfied by the brightest agn @xcite .",

    "the probability that a muon produced by the interaction of a muon neutrino with a nucleon will cross the detector is given by the ratio of the muon and neutrino mean free paths ( note , that since the mean free path of muons of energy @xmath54  tev is of order 1 km , a detector with effective cross - sectional area @xmath52 corresponds to a detector with an effective volume @xmath55 ) . for water and ice ,",
    "this probability is @xmath56 , with @xmath57 for @xmath58  tev and @xmath59 for @xmath60  tev ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the neutrino flux required for the detection of @xmath61 events is @xmath62 a lower limit to the source flux is also set by the requirement that the signal would exceed the background produced by atmospheric neutrinos .",

    "<S> detection of high energy neutrinos associated with electromagnetically identified sources will allow to identify the sources of uhecrs , will provide a unique probe of the sources , which may allow to resolve open questions related to the underlying physics of models describing these powerful accelerators , and will provide information on fundamental neutrino properties . </S>"
