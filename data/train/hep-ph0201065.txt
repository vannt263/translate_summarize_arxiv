    "semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) of leptons off a nucleon is an important process to study the internal structure of the nucleon and its spin properties . in particular",
    ", measurements of azimuthal distributions of the detected hadron provide valuable information on hadron structure functions , quark - gluon correlations and parton fragmentation functions .",
    "the kinematics of sidis in the case of longitudinally polarized target is illustrated in fig.1 : @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) is the 4-momentum of the incoming ( outgoing ) charged lepton , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the 4-momentum of the virtual photon .",
    "@xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is the momentum of the target ( observed ) hadron , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the incoming lepton transverse momentum with respect to the virtual photon momentum direction , and @xmath0 is the azimuthal angle between @xmath12 and @xmath11 around the virtual photon direction , angle @xmath13 is a virtual photon emission angle and @xmath14 is the target polarization parallel to the incoming lepton momentum , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the longitudinal and transverse spin in the virtual photon frame , respectively  @xcite : @xmath17 @xmath18    in sidis one assumes the factorization of the cross section , schematically @xmath19 where the soft parts , the distribution function @xmath20 and the fragmentation function @xmath21 depend not only on @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively , but also on quark s transverse momenta ; @xmath24 describes the scattering among elementary constituents and can be calculated perturbatively in the framework of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "l8.0 cm    due to the non - zero parton intrinsic transverse momentum , in the sidis cross section besides the conventional twist-2 non - perturbative blocks , there are different combinations of twist - two and twist - three structures , which could be probed in azimuthal asymmetries of hard scattering processes .",
    "the complete tree - level description expression containing contributions from twist - two and twist - three distribution and fragmentation functions in sidis has been given in ref .",
    "the full result for the sidis cross section contains a large number of terms . in this respect",
    "it is more practical to split up it in the parts involving the lepton polarizations , unpolarized ( u ) or longitudinally ( l ) polarized and target polarizations , unpolarized ( u ) , longitudinal ( l ) , and transverse ( t ) polarized keeping only the @xmath0-independent and @xmath0-dependent terms , relevant in following .",
    "it can be presented in the following way order . ] : @xmath25 where the first subscript corresponds to beam polarization and the second one to the target polarization . here",
    "the terms proportional to @xmath26 indicate the `` kinematical '' or dynamical twist-3 contributions .",
    "in inclusive processes , at leading @xmath26 order , besides the well - known parton distribution @xmath27 , often denoted as @xmath28 , the longitudinal spin distribution @xmath29 , often denoted as @xmath30 , there is a third twist - two distribution function , the transversity distribution function @xmath31 , also often denoted as @xmath32 .",
    "it was first discussed by ralston and soper@xcite in double transverse polarized drell - yan scattering .",
    "the transversity distribution @xmath31 measures the probability to find a transversely polarized quark in a transversely polarized nucleon .",
    "it is equally important for the description of the spin structure of nucleons as the more familiar function @xmath29 ; their information being complementary . in the non - relativistic limit ,",
    "where boosts and rotations commute , @xmath33 ; then difference between these two functions may turn out to be a measure for the relativistic effects within nucleons . on the other hand ,",
    "there is no gluon analog on @xmath31 .",
    "this may have interesting consequences for ratios of transverse to longitudinal asymmetries in polarized hard scattering processes ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the transversity remains still unmeasured , contrary to the case for spin - average and helicity structure functions , which are known over large ranges of @xmath34 and @xmath22 ( see fig.2 ) the reason is that it is a chiral odd function , and consequently it is suppressed in inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( dis )  @xcite . since electroweak and strong interactions conserve chirality , @xmath31 can not occur alone , but has to be accompanied by a second chiral odd quantity .",
    "it is illustrated in fig . 3 from ref .",
    "@xcite .    in principle , transversity distributions can be extracted from cross section asymmetries in polarized processes involving a transversely polarized nucleon . in the case of hadron - hadron scattering",
    "these asymmetries can be expressed through a flavor sum involving a product of two chiral - odd transversity distributions .",
    "this is one of the main goals of the spin program at rhic  @xcite ( fig .",
    "3b ) .    in the case of sidis off",
    "transversely polarized nucleons ( fig.3c ) there exist several methods to access transversity distributions .",
    "one of them , the twist-3 pion production @xcite , uses longitudinally polarized leptons and measures a double spin asymmetry .",
    "other methods do not require a polarized beam , and rely on the _ polarimetry _ of the scattered transversely polarized quark .",
    "they consist on :    * the measurement of the transverse polarization of @xmath35 s in the current fragmentation region @xcite , * the observation of a correlation between the transverse spin vector of the target nucleon and the normal to the two - meson plane @xcite , * the observation of the `` collins effect '' in quark fragmentation through the measurement of pion single target - spin asymmetries @xcite .    in sec .",
    "2 i will focus on the last method  collins fragmentation function , @xmath36 which can be simply interpreted as the production probability of an unpolarized hadron from a transversely polarized quark  @xcite .",
    "a first indication of a nonzero @xmath36 comes from analysis of the 91 - 95 lep1 data ( delphi )  @xcite   at belle  @xcite are currently being examined . ] . in numerical calculations",
    "the collins ansatz  @xcite for the analyzing power of transversely polarized quark fragmentation was used : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is taken as a constant , although , in principle it could be @xmath23 dependent . in this case the @xmath23 dependence of the single - spin azimuthal asymmetries ( ssaa ) conditioned by strong correlations between kinematical variables .    due to non - zero quark transverse momentum in semi - inclusive processes , at leading @xmath26 order ,",
    "in addition to the above discussed distribution functions , there are three non - vanishing distribution functions , @xmath39 .",
    "these functions relate the transverse ( longitudinally ) polarization of the quark to the longitudinally ( transverse ) polarization of the nucleon .",
    "in recent years significant ssaa have been observed in experiments with transversely polarized proton and anti - proton beams , respectively@xcite .",
    "very recently a significant target - spin asymmetry of the distributions in the azimuthal angle @xmath0 of the pion related to the lepton scattering plane for @xmath40 electroproduction in a _ longitudinally _ polarized hydrogen target has been observed by the hermes collaboration  @xcite ( fig.4 ) . at the same time",
    "the smc collaboration has studied the azimuthal distributions of pions produced in deep inelastic scattering off _",
    "transversely _ polarized protons and deuterons  @xcite .",
    "l9 cm    these non - zero asymmetries may originate from multi - parton correlations in initial or final states and non - zero parton transverse momentum .",
    "they have initiated a number of phenomenological approaches to evaluate these asymmetries using different input distribution and fragmentation functions .",
    "an analysis of different approximations , which aim at explaining the experimental data , have been provided in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the approximation where the twist-2 _ transverse _ quark spin distribution in the _ longitudinally _ polarized nucleon , @xmath41 , is considered small enough to be neglected  @xcite with the assumption of the u - quark dominance are in good agreement with the bjorken-@xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath12 behaviors of the _ sin_@xmath0 asymmetry for charged and neutral pion production observed at hermes ( see figs .",
    "5,6 )   production the data are consistent with zero in agreement with the result of the approximation . ] .",
    "note , that it does not require the twist-3 interaction - dependent part of the fragmentation function , @xmath42 , to be zero , which leads to the inconsistency that all t - odd fragmentation functions would be required to vanish  @xcite .",
    "results on ssaa provide evidence in support of the existence of non - zero chiral - odd structures that describe the transverse polarization of quarks .",
    "new data are expected from future hermes , compass measurements on a transversely polarized target , which will give direct access to the transversity  @xcite .",
    "the nonzero transverse momenta of the partons as a consequence of being confined by the strong interactions inside hadrons , generates significant azimuthal asymmetries , which show up as a _ cos_@xmath0 and _ cos_@xmath43 terms in the _ unpolarized _ sidis  @xcite .",
    "the experimental results of the emc  @xcite and e665  @xcite are described well by the simple parton model  @xcite , where both first - order perturbative qcd effects  @xcite and non - perturbative intrinsic transverse momentum effects  @xcite were taken into account . the most important contribution to azimuthal dependence of _ unpolarized _",
    "sidis comes from kinematical effect of the intrinsic transverse momentum .",
    "however , to get a complete behavior of azimuthal distributions one has to take into account also higher twist effects  @xcite . in the ref .",
    "@xcite authors tried to isolate the higher twist effects .",
    "a self - consistent study of unpolarized azimuthal asymmetries .",
    "i.g . taking into account all effects that generate these asymmetries is still an open issue . to make an analogy between spin - independent and double - spin",
    "_ cos_@xmath0 asymmetries i would like to present the tree level contributions to spin - independent _",
    "cos_@xmath0 asymmetry from ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath44 being @xmath45 @xmath46 where @xmath47 @xmath48    when in the eq.([uuc ] ) the interaction dependent parts of df s and ff s are set to zero , the asymmetry reduces to a kinematical effect conditioned by intrinsic transverse momentum of partons in the nucleon as was calculated by cahn  @xcite .",
    "here i will focus my attention on the _ cos_@xmath0 moment of the double - spin azimuthal asymmetry ( dsaa ) for pion electroproduction in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering of longitudinally polarized leptons off longitudinally polarized protons ( for details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the contribution to double - spin _ cos_@xmath49 asymmetry with the combinations of different leading and sub - leading distribution and fragmentation function",

    "the above defined weighted asymmetry is related to the experimentally observable asymmetry through the following relation @xmath57 using the eqs .",

    "sidis  @xcite , i.e. all twist-3 interaction dependent distribution and fragmentation functions are set to zero  @xcite . in that approximation assuming a gaussian parameterization for the distribution of the initial parton s intrinsic transverse momentum , @xmath59 , in the helicity distribution function @xmath61 one obtains @xmath62    to estimate the transverse asymmetry contribution ( @xmath63 ) into the @xmath64 , one can act as in the ref .  @xcite .    in fig.7 , the asymmetry @xmath65 of eq.([as ] ) for @xmath40 production on a proton target",

    "the curves are calculated by integrating over the hermes kinematic ranges , taking @xmath66 gev as input ( for more details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    from fig.7 one can see that the approximation where all twist-3 df s and ff s are set to zero gives the large negative double - spin _ cos_@xmath0 asymmetry at hermes energies .",
