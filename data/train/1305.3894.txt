    "the uniform behaviour of @xmath21 on the boundary of @xmath15 in case of three qubits is , as already indicated in ref.@xcite , a low dimensional phenomenon . as we explain in section [ sec : the - reduced - spaces ] , for an arbitrary number of @xmath0 qubits the boundary consists of three parts characterized by a different behaviour of @xmath21 .",
