    "the recent radial velocity detection of a planet in the habitable zone of the nearby m dwarf proxima centauri ( hereafter proxima  b and proxima ) @xcite has spurred over a dozen theoretical papers speculating on the planet s atmosphere ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , habitability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and orbital and formation histories ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as prospects for a direct detection or atmospheric characterization ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as proxima is the nearest neighbor to the solar system , it has been suggested as a target for future space missions , including those hoping to characterize its atmosphere and search for life ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in many of these studies , authors have assumed a rocky planet with a thin atmosphere or no atmosphere at all , and some have assumed a mass near or equal to the projected mass of @xmath7 @xmath1 , but little has been done to assign a degree of certainty to these assumptions .",
    "most notably , previous studies have revealed two distinct populations of exoplanets with super - earth radii : ` rocky ' planets composed almost entirely of rock , iron , and silicates with at most a thin atmosphere , and ` sub - neptune ' planets which must contain a significant amount of ice or a h / he envelope ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if there is a significant probability that proxima  b is of the latter composition , then this should be taken into account when assessing its potential habitability or observability .    in this letter",
    ", we generate posterior distributions for the mass of proxima  b using monte carlo simulations of exoplanets with an isotropic distribution of inclinations , where the radii , masses , and compositions of the simulated planets are constrained by results from combined transit and radial velocity measurements of previously detected exoplanets . by comparing the posterior mass distribution to the composition of planets as a function of mass",
    ", we determine the likelihood that proxima  b is , in fact , a rocky world with a thin ( if any ) atmosphere .",
    "radial velocity and transit studies of exoplanets have yielded mass and radius measurements for a statistically significant number of targets , thereby enabling the study of how the occurrence and composition of exoplanets varies with planet radii , orbital periods , and host star type . in this section ,",
    "we review previous results which we will use to place stronger constraints on the mass and composition of proxima  b.      it can be shown ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the probability distribution of @xmath8 corresponding to an isotropic inclination distribution is    @xmath9    since this distribution peaks at @xmath10 , the mass distribution of an rv - detected planet - assuming no prior constraints on the mass - peaks at the minimum mass @xmath11 .    in their models of the possible orbital histories of proxima b ,",
    "@xcite find that galactic tides could have inflated the eccentricity of the host star s ( at the time unconfirmed ) orbit around the @xmath12 cen binary , leading to encounters within a few hundred au and the possible disruption of proxima s planetary system .",
    "if so , this could affect the likely inclination of the planet in a non - isotropic way .",
    "however , @xcite have presented radial velocity measurements showing that proxima is gravitationally bound to the @xmath12 cen system with an orbital period of 550,000 years , an eccentricity of @xmath13 , and a periapsis distance of 4,200 au . at this distance ,",
    "the ratio of proxima s gravitational field to that of @xmath12 cen at the planet s orbit ( @xmath14 au ) is greater than @xmath15 ; unless proxima s orbit was significantly more eccentric in the past , it seems unlikely that @xmath12 cen would have disrupted the system .",
    "@xcite provide up - to - date occurrence rates of planets around m dwarf stars from the _ kepler _ mission .",
    "the sample is limited to @xmath16 days , over which they find the occurrence rates to be mostly independent of the period .",
    "the binned rates and a regression curve , as well as their uncertainties , are presented in figure [ fig : occurrence_rates ] .",
    "_ kepler _ statistics for m dwarfs remain incomplete below 1 @xmath6 , but complete statistics for earlier - type stars suggest a flat distribution for @xmath17 @xmath6  @xcite . since mass - radius relationships typically find a strong dependence of mass on radius ( @xmath18 ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we assume _ a priori _ that proxima  b ( @xmath19 @xmath1 ) is larger than @xmath20 @xmath6 . therefore , for this letter we adopt the regression curve fitted to the binned data , but set the occurrence rates to be flat for @xmath21 @xmath6 .    * occurrence rates for m dwarf planets + ( with @xmath22 days ) *    ( dotted ) to be flat , since the sample is incomplete in this range .",
    "bottom : mass - radius relationships for the rocky ( blue ) and sub - neptune ( red ) populations .",

    "the plotted relationships are from @xcite ( solid ) and @xcite ( dashed).[fig : occurrence_rates ] [ fig : mass - radius_relationship ] ]      multiple works ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have determined the existence of two distinct populations of exoplanets smaller than neptune ( @xmath25 @xmath6 ) : a small radius population with densities consistent with an entirely iron and silicate composition ( hereafter ` rocky ' ) , and a large radius population with lower density planets which must have significant amounts of ice or a thick h / he atmosphere ( hereafter ` sub - neptunes ' ) .",
    "@xcite studies the abundance of planets of each composition as a function of radius .",
    "they define @xmath26 as the likelihood that a planet of radius @xmath27 is dense enough to be consistent with a rocky composition , and determine @xmath28 for a sample of planets with known masses and radii . they suggest fitting the data with a two - parameter linear model :    @xmath29    they find a step function to best describe the data , with @xmath30 fixed at zero and @xmath31 @xmath6 . for the purposes of this letter",
    ", we prefer this fit , but will also vary @xmath32 and @xmath30 to see how they affect our results .",
    "we stress that a planet for which @xmath33 is only _ sufficiently _ dense to be rocky ; we still can not necessarily exclude an ice or volatile component . here",
    ", we will assume that all planets for which @xmath33 follow the low - radius m - r relationships given in the following section , which were empirically fitted without prior knowledge of the planets compositions .",
    "for simplicity , we refer to these as ` rocky ' planets , and the other population as ` sub - neptunes ' , but we will revisit this distinction later on .    since proxima b is in the habitable zone , it receives an amount of stellar flux comparable to that received by earth , so we should bear in mind the possibility that the volatile envelope of a sub - neptune could be lost due to photoevaporation .",
    "@xcite model rocky planets with thick h / he envelopes in the habitable zones of m dwarfs , finding that planets with @xmath34 @xmath1  maintain their envelopes over gyr timescales and are therefore uninhabitable .",
    "the 2@xmath35 lower limit on the minimum mass of proxima b is @xmath36 @xmath1 , so it is unlikely that any h / he envelope on the planet would evaporate under this rule .",
    "however , we note that this study focuses on planets with a primarily rocky composition , so it may not be directly applicable to habitable zone sub - neptunes .    additionally , @xcite empirically define boundaries for atmospheric evaporation as a function of stellar heating , escape velocity , and atmospheric composition . in particular , a planet receiving an earth - like flux must have an escape velocity above @xmath37 km / s in order to maintain an h@xmath38 atmosphere for 5 gyr .",
    "we will revisit this requirement in section [ sec : escape ] .",
    "empirically derived relationships between exoplanet masses and radii rely on radial velocity ( rv ) or transit - timing variation ( ttv ) measurements of transiting exoplanet masses .",
    "@xcite fit a mass - radius ( hereafter m - r ) relationship to a sample of 65 transiting exoplanets , in which they find evidence for the two populations discussed in section [ sec : compositions ] .",
    "through least - squares regression , they find the densities of the rocky planets to increase linearly with planet radius : @xmath39 while the rv - measured masses of sub - neptunes increase nearly linearly with planet radius : @xmath40    @xcite use an expanded version of this data set to fit power law m - r relationships using a more statistically robust bayesian method .",
    "for the rocky planets , they find @xmath41 and for the sub - neptunes with rv - measured masses , @xmath42    due to the larger sample size and more robust fitting procedure , we adopt equations [ equation : wolfgang_rocky ] and [ equation : wolfgang_rv ] as our preferred m - r relationships , but for completeness we consider the @xcite relationships as well . we find that the choice of m - r relationships has a minimal impact on our final results .",
    "both sets of relationships are plotted in figure [ fig : mass - radius_relationship ] .",
    "it is important to note that the above relationships for sub - neptunes exclude masses measured by ttv , since ttv masses have been found to be systematically lower than rv masses .",
    "this could indicate a selection bias or systematic error in the method used , but since proxima  b was detected through rv measurements , we believe it is proper to exclude the ttv masses either way .",
    "it is also clear that there is a significant spread in the masses of the observed planets .",
    "@xcite suggest a spread of @xmath43 @xmath1  for the sub - neptune planets , which we adopt for our simulations . for rocky planets ,",
    "the spread is noticeably smaller .",
    "there are too few planets to constrain this spread , but it should most likely increase with mass , so we arbitrarily define the spread to be 30% of the calculated mass .",
    "the fitted occurrence rates and their uncertainties ( @xmath44 ) are given in even bins in log - space .",
    "we use them to generate a random sample of radii , where the number of radii in each bin ( @xmath45 ) is selected from a normal distribution with mean value @xmath46 and standard deviation @xmath47 .",
    "we find that the results converge for 1,000 samples of the occurrence rates , with each sample containing @xmath48 radii .    to each radius ,",
    "we assign a composition ( ` rocky ' or ` sub - neptune ' ) based on the model of @xcite ( equation [ equation : rogers_linear ] ) , with @xmath49 @xmath6  and @xmath50 .",
    "we then assign a mass to each radius and composition from a gaussian distribution with mean value @xmath51 - calculated using our chosen m - r relationships ( equations [ equation : wolfgang_rocky ] and [ equation : wolfgang_rv ] ) - and a standard deviation @xmath52 which represents the spread .",
    "we choose a spread proportional to the calculated mass for rocky planets ( @xmath53 ) , but a constant spread for sub - neptunes ( @xmath54 @xmath1 ) .",
    "we also reject negative masses , which could in principle bias the assigned masses towards higher - than - average values - however , we find that only a negligible number of masses are rejected .    finally , we assign a line - of - sight inclination parameter @xmath8 to each planet , drawn from the isotropic probability distribution discussed in section [ sini_distribution ] .      the prior mass and radius distributions , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , can be derived directly from the simulated sample .",
    "factoring in the projected minimum mass @xmath11 , the posterior distributions @xmath57 and @xmath58 can be calculated from bayes formula : @xmath59 where @xmath60 represents mass or radius .",
    "since @xmath11 is known , @xmath61 is just a normalizing constant .",
    "taking @xmath62 @xmath1  as the projected mass of proxima  b and the upper limit @xmath63",
    "@xmath1  as its standard deviation , we calculate for each simulated planet @xmath64    then @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the average values of @xmath67 for each bin in mass or radius . the prior and posterior distributions are calculated for each sample of @xmath68 planets , and the final results are taken to be the mean result of 1,000 samples .      the prior probability that a planet in a given mass bin is rocky is equal to the number of simulated rocky planets in that bin divided by the total number of planets in the same bin . since we want to know the likelihood that proxima  b belongs to the ` rocky ' population , we multiply this prior composition probability distribution by the posterior mass distribution from the previous section and integrate over all masses .",

    "[ fig : cumulative_pdf ] ]    the prior and posterior mass probability distributions for proxima  b are plotted in figure [ fig : prior_posterior_pdf ] .",
    "the shaded regions demonstrate the relative contributions of the populations at each mass .",
    "the prior distribution is valid for rv - detected planets around m dwarfs with intermediate periods ( @xmath69 days ) and radii ( @xmath70 @xmath6 ) , while the posterior distribution can be taken as the mass probability distribution for proxima  b.    for reference , we include the posterior distribution given _ no _ prior constraints on the mass ; that is , the distribution resulting from an isotropic @xmath8 distribution and the measured @xmath11 with its uncertainty .",
    "we find that this nearly matches our result , since both @xmath71 and @xmath55 are bottom - heavy .",
    "figure [ fig : cumulative_pdf ] shows the cumulative probability that @xmath72 for both of the considered m - r relationships ( section [ sec : mass - radius_relationships ] ) as well as for the case of no prior mass distribution .",
    "we find that there is little difference between the results for each m - r relationship .      in order to verify that sub - neptune planets can maintain h@xmath38 envelopes in the habitable zone",
    ", we compare the escape velocities of our simulated sub - neptunes to the @xmath37 km / s cutoff for h@xmath38 atmospheric escape ( assuming an earth - like stellar flux ) defined by @xcite . in both the prior and posterior distributions of escape velocities",
    ", we find that fewer than 1% of the sub - neptunes have escape velocities below this threshold , with most having @xmath73 km / s .",
    "therefore , we do not believe that proxima b will be subject to significant atmospheric loss if it has a sub - neptune composition .",
    "table [ tab : cases ] lists the sets of parameters for which we run the simulation , including the mass spread @xmath52 for each composition and the central value ( @xmath32 ) and width ( @xmath30 , if nonzero ) of the transition region defined by equation [ equation : rogers_linear ] .",
    "the following results for each case are given : the probability @xmath74 that proxima  b belongs to the ` rocky ' category of planets , i.e. that its density is _ consistent _ with a fully iron and silicate composition , and the expectation values @xmath75 and @xmath76 of the mass and radius under the assumption that it belongs to this population .",
    "case a is most consistent with the previous work we have cited , so we take it as our primary result . in this case",
    ", there is a @xmath2 probability that proxima  b belongs to the ` rocky ' population , with an @xmath77 likelihood that it belongs to the ` sub - neptune ' population . in the case",
    "that it is rocky , the expectation values ( and 95% confidence intervals ) for the mass and radius are @xmath4 @xmath1  and @xmath5 @xmath6 .",
    "we investigate the effect of increasing ( case b ) and decreasing ( case c ) the mass spread for each composition , which results in lower and higher values of @xmath74 , respectively .",
    "this results from low - radius ( @xmath78 @xmath6 ) , low - mass sub - neptunes ; when @xmath52 is large , they can lie significantly below the m - r relation with masses between 1 and 2 @xmath1 , so that they are indistinguishable from the rocky planets in the mass domain .    in cases d and e , we determine the effect of raising or lowering the threshold radius @xmath32 at which the rocky and sub - neptune populations are split .",
    "a 0.2 @xmath6  offset in either direction , which encompasses most of the values suggested in the literature , results in a @xmath79 to @xmath80 shift in @xmath74 , where higher threshold radii allow for more rocky planets and therefore a higher probability of a rocky composition . furthermore , allowing for a non - zero width @xmath30 to the cutoff region allows sub - neptunes to exist with lower radii and masses , thereby decreasing @xmath74 .    in all cases ,",
    "we find @xmath74 to be between @xmath81 and @xmath82 using the @xcite m - r relationship , and we find similar values using the @xcite relationship ( e.g. @xmath83 for case a ) , so this result does not vary substantially over the range of reasonable values for the input parameters .",
    "by considering occurrence rates from the _ kepler _ mission and empirically derived m - r relationships , we derive a posterior probability distribution for the actual mass of proxima  b. if the planet has a rocky composition , i.e. if it obeys the low - radius m - r relationship of @xcite , then the expectation values of the mass and radius ( with 95% confidence intervals ) are @xmath4 @xmath1  and @xmath5 @xmath6 .    in all of our simulations , we find a probability of 80% to 95% that proxima  b belongs to the ` rocky ' population of planets defined in section [ sec : compositions ] . in our ` best guess ' scenario ( case a ) , this probability is 90% .",
    "critically , we note that we have assumed all planets with @xmath33 ( according to the @xcite criterion ) are rocky planets , while in reality their density is only consistent with such a composition . with this in mind",
    ", it is safest to say that there is _ at least _ a 10% chance that proxima  b has a sub - neptune composition .",
    "if it is a sub - neptune , then its surface gravity is high enough that it could maintain a thick hydrogen atmosphere .    for future theoretical work involving the habitability and detectability of proxima  b , we advise caution regarding assumptions made about its mass or composition",
    "; if proxima  b does possess a thick h / he envelope , then it is likely not habitable in the traditional sense .",
    "even if the mass could be further constrained , sub - neptunes have been measured with masses as low as @xmath84 @xmath1 , so the composition can not be conclusively inferred from the mass alone .",
    "nevertheless , the rocky composition originally asserted by @xcite remains the most likely possibility .",
