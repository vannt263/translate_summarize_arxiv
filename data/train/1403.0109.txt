    "<S> we are interested by the study of several toy models of the universe in presence of interacting quintessence de models . </S>",
    "<S> models are considered in the cosmology with an effective varying @xmath0-term in lyra manifold . </S>",
    "<S> the motivation of the phenomenological models discussed in this paper is to obtain corresponding models to describe and understand an accelerated expansion of the universe for the later stage of evolution . </S>",
    "<S> phenomenology of the models describes by the phenomenological forms of @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> concerning to the mathematical hardness we discuss results numerically and graphically . obtained results give us hope that proposed models can work as good models for old universe and in good agreement with observational data .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section ] ]    analysis of the observational data shows that our universe for later stages of evolution indicates accelerated expansion . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion is based on the observations of high redshift type snia supernovae [ 1]-[3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the last problem is an interesting and important theoretical problem , and the best solutions of this problem based on an assumptions and carries phenomenological character . </S>",
    "<S> according to the data analysis we accept that in the universe one of the main components is a dark energy and its negative pressure ( positive energy density ) has enough power to work against gravity and provide accelerated expansion of the universe . to have a balance in universe the second component known as dark matter </S>",
    "<S> is considered , which is responsible for the completely other phenomenon known as structure formation . </S>",
    "<S> according to different estimations dark energy occupies about @xmath3 of the energy of our universe , while dark matter , about @xmath4 , and usual baryonic matter occupy about @xmath5 . the surveys of clusters of galaxies show that the density of matter is very much less than critical density [ 4 ] , observations of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies indicate that the universe is flat and the total energy density is very close to the critical @xmath6 [ 5 ] . the simple model for the de is the cosmological constant with two problems called fine - tuning and coincidence @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these problems have opened ways for alternative models for the dark energy including a dynamical form of dark energy , as a variable cosmological constant @xcite-@xcite , k - essence model @xcite-@xcite , chaplygin gas models @xcite-@xcite to mention a few . in recent times </S>",
    "<S> were shown that certain type of interaction between de and dm also could solve mentioned problems . on the other hand one can modify the left hand side of einstein equation and obtain theories such as @xmath7 theory of the gravity @xcite-@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> modifications of these types provide an origin of a fluid identified with dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of an accelerated expansion contributed from geometry were considered even before proposed modifications . </S>",
    "<S> but such theories with different forms of modifications still should pass experimental tests , because they contain ghosts , finite - time future singularities e.t.c , which is the base of other theoretical problems . </S>",
    "<S> one of the well studied dark energy models is a quintessence model @xcite-@xcite , which is a scalar field model described by a field @xmath8 and @xmath9 potential and it is the simplest scalar - field scenario without having theoretical problems such as the appearance of ghosts and laplacian instabilities . energy density and pressure of quintessence de given as @xmath10 and @xmath11 we consider the models of the universe where an effective energy density and pressure assumed to be given as @xmath12 and @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are energy density and pressure of a barotropic fluid which will model dm in universe with @xmath16 eos equation . </S>",
    "<S> if we will model the background dynamics of the universe within many component fluid , then we will have @xmath17 and @xmath18 where @xmath19 represents the number of components . </S>",
    "<S> last assumption is at the heart of the modern theoretical cosmology , and is a starting assumption for all articles in cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> it can work particularly for old large scale universe , where quantum and nonequilibrium effects are not considered . </S>",
    "<S> would the last assumption work in early young universe is an open question , because for early universe with high energy / small scales quantum effects can have unexpected effects and how the situation should be modified is not clear yet . </S>",
    "<S> as well as we have other conceptual problems , for instance , we do not know how correctly we can model content of the early universe ( which is also open problem for old universe ) . as in this work we will consider interaction between components , we would like to have a short discussion on that topic . </S>",
    "<S> apart mathematical speculation concerning to the interaction between de and dm , there is a question concerning to the physics of the interaction @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> since there is not any reason in nature preventing or suppressing a nonminimal coupling between dark energy and dark matter , there may exist interactions between the two components . </S>",
    "<S> moreover from observations , no piece of evidence has been so far presented against such interactions . </S>",
    "<S> theoretically , several forms of the interaction discussed in recent years , give us possibility to alleviate the coincidence problem , therefore such approach gives a hope and it is one of the active questions considered in literature . despite to the efforts the microscopic nature of the interaction is not clear ( up to our knowledge ) and considered models based on a phenomenological assumptions . </S>",
    "<S> the question how the interaction between two components arose is not answered yet . </S>",
    "<S> one of the assumptions concerning to the interaction between components , is probably the same origin of de and dm which were from the very begining . </S>",
    "<S> however it is not clear why they should continue their connection , when they operate on different scales and responsible for different processes . </S>",
    "<S> probably the final theory of quantum gravity can answer to this question , as the theory is missing and there is a posibility to make an assumption , we think a quantum effect like modified entanglement exist , informing de and dm that they were the same for very early stages of evolution . </S>",
    "<S> below , we would like to present several forms of interaction @xmath20 between de and dm , which are the results of mathematical speculations . </S>",
    "<S> one group of @xmath20 with a general form described as @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are positive constants . </S>",
    "<S> typical value of them is about @xmath24 . in the other group </S>",
    "<S> we can include interactions where on the base of classical forms of interactions some modifications are assumed , like @xmath22 or @xmath23 to be a function of time @xmath25 . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> the problem solving strategy and structure is the following we will assume that the form of the potential @xmath9 is given @xmath26}.\\ ] ] we already made several attempts to consider cosmologies where @xmath27 and @xmath1 are varying functions instead of the constants . </S>",
    "<S> consideration of varying @xmath28 and @xmath0 supposed modification of the field equations . in this work we will consider cosmological models defined in lyra manifold with an effective varying @xmath0 term . </S>",
    "<S> three different forms for the interaction between a barotropic fluid and a quintessence de are considered . </S>",
    "<S> each form of the interaction suppose an existance of the certain type of the model . </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we have 6 different models , because depends on the type of the interaction , we also considered a possibility that @xmath0 is a constant . </S>",
    "<S> models ordered as model 1 , model 2 and model 3 described by the interaction terms @xmath20 @xmath29 @xmath30 and @xmath31 the second group of the models ( model 4 , model 5 and model 5 ) will be described by the same three forms of @xmath20 with @xmath1 given as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a positive constant , @xmath9 is the potential of the field . </S>",
