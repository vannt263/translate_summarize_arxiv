    "among the dynamical processes in star formation regions , infall appears to be critical in understanding the processes of mass accumulation in star formation cores and the growth of protostars .",
    "the protostellar infall rate depends on the surface density of the protostellar core , which usually can be determined from observations of self - absorptions of the embedded molecular clumps in it .",
    "however , it is difficult to unambiguously identify infall based on low angular - resolution observations because the spectral features of a complex with bipolar molecular outflows , rotating structures or multiple cores can produce similar characteristics to those expected from self - absorption in infalling clumps . in many young star formation regions that show spectral signatures of infall from single - dish observations , the single - dish spectral features often turn out to be dominated by outflows and other kinematic features with further high - resolution observations using interferometer arrays .",
    "w3-se is a dense molecular core located 2 kpc away @xcite , se of the well - known massive star formation region w3-main .",
    "the w3-se core was first imaged by @xcite in the nh@xmath10(1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) lines .",
    "the low kinetic temperature of 25 k based on the nh@xmath10 line ratio @xcite and the absence of iras emission @xcite implied that this core is probably in an early evolutionary stage .",
    "a virial mass of @xmath2300 m@xmath6 was inferred from the line widths , indicating that this core may be a birthplace for intermediate- or high - mass stars . however , to date there has been no evidence for ob stars present in the core because of the non - detection from the radio continuum emission at 6 cm with the vla @xcite . on the other hand , a possible infall signature in w3-se",
    "was suggested by @xcite based on observations of multiple molecular lines with the iram 30-m telescope . both the hco@xmath0 ( 1 - 0 ) and ( 3 - 2 ) lines show an asymmetric double profile characterized by a primary peak blue - shifted with respect to a peak velocity of the optically thin lines such as c@xmath11o(1 - 0 ) , while a secondary peak is red - shifted .",
    "the possible signature of infall in w3-se suggested from the single - dish observations needs further verification with improved , high resolution observations .",
    "besides , @xcite reported a detection of a mid - ir point source in the region of w3-se and determined the flux densities in the four bands of the infrared array camera ( irac ) on the _ spitzer space telescope_. the color - color diagram in their paper indicates that this source is most likely to be a yso ( class i or earlier ) with large excess emissions at longer wavelengths .    in this paper , we present new results based on observations at @xmath1  3.4 , 1.1 , 0.85/0.45 mm with the combined array for research in millimeter - wave astronomy ( carma ) , the submillimeter array ( sma ) and the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) , respectively , along with the data at mid - ir wavelengths obtained from both the _ spitzer space telescope _ and _ midcourse space experiment _ ( msx ) archives .",

    "the observations include two tracks .",
    "the first one lasted for 5 hours using 14 antennas with a 19-point mosaic , and the second one was taken for 4 hours using 13 antennas with a 7-point mosaic . because the first track was on a maintenance day ,",

    "located @xmath22@xmath3 sw to irac 56 there appears to be an additional point source ( hereafter irac 56b ) detected at 4.5 @xmath22 , but we failed to fit it as a point source due to the contamination from the profile wing of the strong point source irac 56 and possible extended pah or h@xmath26 emission .",
    "the nature of this source remains uncertain .",
    "in addition , we note that there appears no significant emission at the mid - ir wavelengths toward the cold dust core sma-2 .    following the procedures of the aperture photometry described early , we determined the mid - ir flux densities from the core region of w3-se .",
    "the total flux densities of w3-se at mid - ir wavelengths from the irac and mips images , as well as the values from the msx images , are summarized in table 3 .",
    "figure 3 shows the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of w3-se covering the wavelengths from millimeter to mid - ir .",
    "we fit the sed with a thermal dust model to determine the physical parameters of the dust components in the core of w3-se . given the dust temperature @xmath27 and the total mass of gas and dust @xmath28 , the continuum emission at the frequency @xmath29 from thermal dust in a molecular core subtending a solid angle @xmath30 can be described as @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 in the optically thin case @xmath33 , equation ( 1 ) can be approximately expressed as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the dust opacity per unit dust mass , @xmath36 is the density ratio of h@xmath26 gas to dust , @xmath37 is the distance , and @xmath38 is the planck function with a dust temperature of @xmath27 . adopting @xmath39(300 ghz ) = 1.4 @xmath40 g@xmath18 as the reference value @xcite , we assumed a power law of @xmath35 = @xmath41(@xmath29/@xmath42)@xmath43 @xcite , where @xmath44 is the power - law index for dust opacity .",
    "in addition , we adopted @xmath36 = 100 and @xmath37 = 2 kpc in the following analysis .",
    "thus , for each dust component , the thermal dust model has three free parameters ( @xmath28 , @xmath27 and @xmath44 ) .",
    "figure 3(a ) shows least square ( lsq ) fitting to the sed with a total of thirteen measurements from submm to mid - ir on the assumption of optically thin dust emission .",
    "we found that a model with two thermal dust components appears to adequately fit the data .",
    "the six free physical parameters of the model can be determined by the lsq fitting to the data .",
    "our best fitting suggests that a cold , massive dust component accounts for the continuum emission at the millimeters / submm as well as a large fraction of the continuum emission at 24 @xmath22 . a total mass of @xmath28 = 70@xmath57 m@xmath6 , a dust temperature of @xmath27 = 35@xmath51 k , and a dust opacity index of @xmath45 were derived from the fitting for this cold , massive dust component . in addition , the emission bump at mid - ir requires a secondary dust component with a small mass but a high temperature .",
    "our fitting gives @xmath46 k , @xmath44 = 0.5@xmath47 and @xmath48 m@xmath6 for the secondary component .",
    "we note that the uncertainties of the derived parameters for the secondary component are large due to the large uncertainties in the mid - ir measurements , especially the ones from msx .",
    "although the optically thin approach is valid for the emission from the cold dust component at millimeter and submm wavelengths and the emission from the hot component at mid - ir , the optical depth of the cold component may become significantly large at the wavelengths of mid - ir . on the assumption that the steep power law of the dust opacity ( @xmath49 ) holds up to the mid - ir , the mean optical depth of @xmath50160 at @xmath1  24 @xmath22 for the cold dust in the region of the double source is inferred using the values of @xmath4 , and @xmath28 derived from the optically thin approach .",
    "thus , the optical - depth effect can not be ignored for the dust emission at the shorter wavelengths .",
    "figure 3(b ) shows a good fit to the observed sed data , considering self - absorption in the cold dust with equation ( 1 ) and assuming that cold component does not overlap the hot dust emission region . consequently , in the self - absorption model",
    "the turnover frequency @xmath51 , where @xmath52 = 1 , is shifted to the higher frequency of 1070 ghz as compared with the value ( @xmath51 = 990 ghz ) derived in the optically thin approach .",
    "the self - absorption model gives a 15% decrease in @xmath53 and a 25% increase in @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath27 = 47 k , and @xmath28 = 60 m@xmath6 , if the power - law index @xmath49 remains unchanged at mid - ir . in the case",
    "that the power - law of the dust opacity becomes flat , e.g. , @xmath44 = 0.5 at the frequencies above 1000 ghz , then @xmath503 at @xmath1  24 @xmath22 and the optical depth effect at mid - ir becomes not so critical .",
    "in any case , the uncertainties in the determination of @xmath27 and @xmath28 appears to be mainly due to the uncertainty in the dependence of the opacity on frequency at mid - ir .",
    "thus , we take the mean values of the physical parameters derived from the two extreme cases , namely @xmath4 = 41@xmath56 k , and @xmath28 = 65@xmath510 m@xmath6 .",
    "our result in dust mass is in good agreement with that of @xcite , which suggests a total mass of 74 m@xmath6 derived from dust continuum for w3-se and a virial mass of 90 m@xmath6 .    on the other hand",
    ", we can estimate the extinction from the cold dust component at mid - ir wavelengths according to recently studies of the mid - ir extinction law . based on the high - resolution observations with the sma at @xmath1",
    "1.1 mm , most of the cold dust ( over @xmath285% ) is concentrated in the two compact mm / submm sources ( sma-1 and -2 ) , the two possible protostellar cores .",
    "assuming an even distribution of the dust over the sizes of the two cores ( see column 5 of table 2 ) , the average column density of the h@xmath26 in the cores would be 1.5@xmath810@xmath54 @xmath55 .",
    "on the basis of the equation [ n(hi)+2n(h@xmath26)]/@xmath56 = 1.67@xmath810@xmath57 @xmath55 mag@xmath18 from @xcite , such a column density is equivalent to an extinction @xmath56 = @xmath2200 mag at k band .",

    "obviously the light from the sources within the two cold dust cores are severely obscured at mid - ir wavelengths .",
    "the residual of the cold dust emission ( @xmath215% , or 0.2 jy at @xmath1  1.1 mm ) appears to be distributed outside the two compact cores , corresponding to a mass of @xmath210 m@xmath6 . on the assumption of an even distribution of this extended cold dust component over a region of 0.15 pc@xmath80.15 pc ( 15@xmath3@xmath815@xmath3 ) , the column density n(h@xmath26 )",

    "the extinction of the extended cold dust distribution to the mid - ir emission from w3-se varies around 1 mag .",
    "this extinction may have some effects on obscuring the emission from the hot dust component depending on the relative distribution of the extended cold dust with respected to the hot dust component .    nevertheless , our fitting to the observed sed of w3-se suggested the existence of a dominant cold dust component with a dust temperature of 41@xmath56 k and a total mass of 65@xmath510 m@xmath6 . a secondary dust component which has a little mass but high dust temperature is necessary to account for the observed emission at irac wavelengths , which is likely heated by the nearby stellar objects ( e.g. irac 56 ) .",
    "the suggested heating process appears to be also consistent with the structure of the mid - ir emission characterized as several discrete compact components as discussed in the previous section ( also see figure 2 ) .",

    ", the red - shifted emission peak appears to coincide near the position a with the blue - shifted emission peak in the velocity range from 39.4 to 40.6 km s@xmath18 , suggesting that the red- and blue - shifted gas components originate from a common core .",
    "at the position a , the line peak intensities are 4.3 and 2.1 jy beam@xmath18 for the red- and blue - shifted gas in w3-se , respectively .",
    "the position b is located at ( 5.1@xmath3 , 9.5@xmath3 ) , n of the main core a , appeared to be a sub - core . at the position b the line emission is much weaker than that at the position a , but the line intensity ratio of the blue and red peak is @xmath22 , similar to that observed from the position a. towards the position c ( 1.1@xmath3 , 6.6@xmath3 ) , the spectrum is dominated by the blue - shifted line component , while the red - shifted line emission appears to be very weak .    besides the three relatively compact structures , there appears to be an extended halo , @xmath240@xmath3 in w3-se .",
    "the total hco@xmath0(1 - 0 ) flux by integrating the line emission above 3@xmath24 from the entire w3-se region is 124 jy km s@xmath18 , which underestimates the true flux because of missing short spacing .",
    "the shortest projected baseline of the carma data is 2.7 k@xmath1 , suggesting missing information on the source structure with a size larger than @xmath276@xmath3 .",

    "the combined image shows better the emission from the extended halo but trades off the detailed structures .",
    "the total line flux of 260 jy km s@xmath18 derived from the combined image is about twice as large as that derived from the carma data alone . towards the peak position",
    "a , the spectrum shows that the intensity peak from the combined data is @xmath225% higher than that of the carma data while the intensity at the spectral dip increases to 0.5 jy ( 5 @xmath24 ) in the combined image from @xmath20 jy of the carma image .",
    "the broad wings of the line profiles in the hco@xmath0(1 - 0 ) spectra suggest that outflow(s ) is active in this molecular cloud .",
    "we imaged the high - velocity portions of the outflow(s ) by integrating the blue spectral wings from 41.4 to 46.7 km s@xmath18 and the red spectral wings from 29.6 to 36.5 km s@xmath18 .",
    "figure 7(a ) shows the blue- and red - shifted gaseous components in blue and red contours , respectively .",
    "it appears that the red - shifted outflow lobe is located nw of the continuum core while the blue - shifted outflow lobe shows two components located se ( c ) and n ( b ) of the continuum core , respectively .",
    "the complex outflow structure implies that there might be more than one outflow in w3-se , and/or the direction of the outflow is close to the line of sight .",

    "= 120@xmath16 in figure.7(a ) ) , we constructed a position - velocity ( p - v ) diagram , showing a kinematic structure which appears to be consistent with a decelerated outflow @xcite .",
    "the p - v diagram shows only the high velocity components that originate from the major core a. however , the major axis of the large - scale outflow is poorly determined due to the poor collimation of red- and blue - shifted emission .",
    "the line emission feature b mimics an independent molecular core based on the overlapping blue- and red - shifted outflows shown in figure 7(a ) although we do not have further evidence either supporting or ruling out the possibility of it being a low - mass star forming core .",
    "the feature b can also be produced from possible multiple outflows originated from the major core a. the line emission feature c appears to be dominated by a blue - shifted outflow lobe originated from the major core a. to clarify the multiplicity of the outflows in w3-se , higher - resolution observations are necessary .",
    "blue - shifted line profiles were discovered by @xcite in hco@xmath0(1 - 0 ) and other optically thick lines , which serve as an infall signature @xcite .",
    "figure 5(b ) shows the spectra at three positions of the components a , b and c. all the spectral profiles towards the three regions appear to be characterized by an asymmetric line profile with a dominated blue - shifted peak and a weaker red - shifted peak .",
    "however , @xcite also noticed the existence of the significant line wings in hco@xmath0 lines from their iram 30-m observation . from our carma observations ,",
    "the observed asymmetric double - peak profiles in spectra towards b and c appear to be due to outflow .",
    "we have shown good evidence for star formation activities occurring in w3-se and kinematics of the molecular gas in the central 50@xmath3 region which is likely dominated by outflows .",
    "we made an attempt to investigate the possible contribution from infall in the line profile of the spectrum towards a , the dust core , with a model including both infall and outflow .    in order to quantitatively",
    "differentiate the contributions from different dynamical processes in the resulting spectral profile , we utilize the infall model of @xcite to fit the spectral line profile .",
    "four parameters : peak optical depths ( @xmath61 ) , kinetic temperature ( @xmath62 ) , velocity dispersion ( @xmath24 ) , and the characteristic velocity ( @xmath63 ) with respect to the system velocity of ( @xmath64 ) , are used in the model to characterize two layers of infall gas .",
    "we found that , indeed , it is difficult to fit the observed spectral profile using a model with only infall components because of the broad blue- and red - shifted wings producing sizable residuals in the fitting .",
    "thus , we introduced an additional two - layer outflow component with four more characteristic parameters , namely , brightness temperature @xmath65 , optical depth ( @xmath66 ) , characteristic velocity ( @xmath67 ) with respect to the system , and the velocity dispersion ( @xmath68 ) in the gaussian profile .",
    "similar approach has been considered in modeling the infall motions in ngc 1333 iras 4 @xcite . here ,",
    "figure 8 shows the result of fitting the observed spectral profile with the modified infall model . assuming @xmath69 k and @xmath70 km s@xmath18 , the best fitting gives @xmath71 , @xmath72 k , @xmath73 km s@xmath18 , @xmath74 km s@xmath18 , @xmath75 km s@xmath18 for the infall component ( the dashed profile in figure 8) and @xmath76 and @xmath77 km s@xmath18 for the outflow ( dotted profile )",
    ". the spectral dip can not be produced with a simple superimposition of the double - gaussian outflow profile ( inset ( a ) in figure 8) to the infall profile ( inset ( b ) in figure 8) .",
    "the spectral dip seen in the resulting line profile is due to the absorption of the cold infall gas located in front of the outflow . after solving the radiative transfer equations ,",
    "the final resulting profile of the model fits the data reasonably well .",
    "the result for the outflow component is not unique .",
    "other combinations of the three parameters @xmath78 , @xmath67 and @xmath79 are also possible to produce a good fit to the observed line profile . in addition to the second kinematic component due to outflow , any other kinematic components within the carma beam ( @xmath26@xmath3 ) characterized with two gaussians separated in velocity , such as two sub - cores orbiting around the mass center ,",
    "can be incorporated into the model in a way similar to that of the outflow , i.e. , the dynamics in the central 6@xmath3 may be equally important in the production of the observed spectral profile .",
    "furthermore , we also note that the observed asymmetric line profile can be produced by an outflow alone if an unequal optical depth is used for red- and blue - shifted components in the outflow . although the modeling is suggestive , we need improved observations with high - angular resolution to differentiate between the dynamical processes",
    ".    the @xmath64 = 38.6 km s@xmath18 derived from the model fitting differs from the mean value ( 38.9 km s@xmath18 ) of the peak velocities from the single - peak optically thin lines such as c@xmath11o ( 1 - 0 ) observed with single - dish @xcite .",
    "such a mean peak velocity derived from observations of optically thin molecular lines is closer to the systematic velocity of the cores .",
    "the small discrepancy between the values of @xmath64 predicted by our model and derived from observations might be due to the assumption of equal optical depth in the blue- and red - shifted outflows used in the model .",
    "furthermore , the absorption dip in the observed hco@xmath0(1 - 0 ) spectrum is centered at @xmath238.0 km s@xmath18 , red - shifted relative to the systematic velocity ( 38.9 km s@xmath18 ) by 0.9 km s@xmath18 , which is in good agreement with the value of @xmath63 derived from the model fitting .    with the caveats discussed above , we can calculate the kinematic infall rate @xmath80 = @xmath81 assuming the spherical geometry .",
    "given a radius @xmath82 = 6@xmath810@xmath83 au for the main core a , a critical density of hco@xmath0(1 - 0 ) @xmath84 = 1.8@xmath810@xmath85 @xmath86 @xcite and a mean molecular weight @xmath87 = 2.35 , an infall rate @xmath80 = 9.7@xmath810@xmath88 m@xmath6 yr@xmath18 is inferred .",
    "this infall rate appears to be consistent with the global gravitational rate @xmath89 = 6.8@xmath810@xmath88 m@xmath6 yr@xmath18 @xcite assuming that the isothermal sound speed @xmath90 equals to the resulting velocity dispersion @xmath24 ( 0.6 km s@xmath18 ) .",
    "indeed , the sound speed of ideal h@xmath26 gas at @xmath91 = 40 k is @xmath92 = 0.5 km s@xmath18 , consistent with the value of the fitted @xmath24",
    ".    alternatively , rotation along with other dynamical process and the depletion of hco@xmath0 in the range of velocity close to the systematical velocity might be also responsible to the observed asymmetric double - peak line profile @xcite .",
    "especially , the velocity gradient as indicated in the p - v diagram of the optically thin c@xmath11o(1 - 0 ) line ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests that a rotation may indeed play an important role in formation of the observed line profile .",
    "in addition , although core a has been resolved into two continuum cores in the sma observations , this multiplicity does not account for the observed double - peak line profile since further molecular - line observations with higher angular resolution show that the double - peak line profile exists in both of the cores @xcite .",
    "the dynamical age of the outflow can be inferred from the spatial extension and the mean velocity of the outflow . in the case of w3-se , the maximum relative velocities ( @xmath75 @xmath24 ) of the blue- and red - shifted outflow lobes from the core",
    "a are @xmath26 km s@xmath18 ( see the p - v diagram in figure 7(b ) ) with respect to the systematic velocity of @xmath93 km s@xmath18 @xcite . assuming a size @xmath2 20@xmath3 ( @xmath24@xmath810@xmath9 au ) for each lobe , the dynamical age of the outflow is @xmath23@xmath810@xmath9 yr .",
    "since the major axis of the outflow is poorly determined and its direction might be close to the line of sight , the estimated dynamical age corresponds to a low limit . given the non - detection of radio continuum , both the typical outflow velocity and the dynamical age indicate that w3-se probably hosts intermediate- and/or low - mass stars .",
    "we calculated the mass associated with the main outflow in w3-se using the formula for column density in the case of a linear , rigid rotor molecule on the assumption of lte @xcite . for hco@xmath0(1 - 0 ) , the total column density at all energy levels can be estimated following the equation : @xmath94 where we adopted the rotational constant @xmath95 = 44.594 ghz and the permanent electric dipole moment @xmath96 = 3.30 debye @xcite . assuming optically thin gas and excitation temperature of t@xmath97 = 40 k , the optical depth @xmath98 is proportional to the brightness temperature @xmath99 @xcite : @xmath100    the outflow mass can be calculated from equation ( 3 ) in the case of optically thin emission , which valid for the outflow gas in the high - velocity wings , @xmath101 where we adopted a fractional abundance x@xmath102 = 7.6@xmath810@xmath103 for w3-se @xcite and a distance @xmath37 = 2 kpc .",
    "then , we determined the velocity - integrated brightness temperature averaged over the emission region @xmath30",
    "@xmath2 50@xmath3@xmath850@xmath3 , @xmath104 = 1.2 k km s@xmath18 between 46.7 and 41.8 km s@xmath18 , and @xmath104 = 1.4 k km s@xmath18 between 36.5 and 31.6 km s@xmath18 .",
    "the corresponding masses are 2.5 and 2.8 m@xmath6 for the blue- and red - shifted outflow lobes , respectively .",
    "consequently , with the maximum relative velocities of the outflow lobes ( @xmath26 km s@xmath18 ) and the dynamic age ( @xmath23@xmath810@xmath9 yr ) , the momentum rates for both the blue and red lobes are @xmath25@xmath810@xmath105 m@xmath6 km s@xmath18 yr@xmath18 , corresponding to mechanical luminosities of 0.2 l@xmath6 .",
    "the inferred outflow momentum rates and mechanical luminosities appear to be consistent with b - type stars in w3-se @xcite .",
    "observations at both millimeter and submm wavelengths , together with those at mid - ir suggest that the main molecular core a hosts a group of young stars and/or protostars .",
    "the millimeter and submm observations suggest that the cold dust is distributed in an elongated region from se to nw ( figure 2 ) with two dust condensations separated by 4@xmath3 .",
    "the non - detection of radio continuum at @xmath1  6 cm @xcite indicates that no ob stars have been found in w3-se yet although we can not rule out the possibility that the two sub - cores in the molecular core a ( sma-1 and -2 ) will continue to accrete from the molecular gas reservoir of @xmath265 m@xmath6 and form a massive star .",
    "the four irac images show a small group of discrete sources in the dust core .",
    "one ( irac 56 ) of them has been identified by @xcite as a point source , suggesting an association with a yso earlier than class i. this source appears to be one of the youngest object in the entire w3 cluster as indicated in the color - color diagram of @xcite . the weak point - like source irac 56a might be associated with a protostar embedded in the dust core sma-1 .",
    "the positions of the emission peaks in the millimeter / submillimeter continuum and lines appear to be displaced significantly from the brightest mid - ir sources in this region .",
    "the majority of the mid - ir emission arises from the region located east of the molecular core ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the displacement likely indicates that the hot and cold dust components which are inferred from fitting the sed are also spatially separated in the w3-se region .",
    "the spatial separation between the hot and cold dust might be explained by sequential star formation in w3-se .",
    "namely , stars formed first in the region east to the main molecular core a in w3-se , where the dust / molecular components might have been substantially dissociated or destroyed by the stars .",
    "the activity of forming new stars is now taking place in a. the activity of star formation appears to propagate from e to w in w3-se .",
    "alternatively , the displacement of the emission peak position at mid - ir from that of millimeter / submillimeter could be due to possible strong mid - ir extinction in the main molecular core a. the scenario of sequential activities in star formation needs to be verified by further improved mid - ir observations with corrections for dust extinction .",
    "we observed w3-se with carma and sma at @xmath1  3.4 and 1.1 mm . using the continuum flux densities determined with carma , sma and jcmt together with measurements at mid - ir wavelengths with _",
    "spitzer _ and msx , we constructed the sed for the w3-se core .",
    "the sed can be fitted with two thermal dust components , suggesting that the majority of the gas / dust ( 65@xmath510 m@xmath6 ) is at a relatively low temperature of 41@xmath56 k corresponding to radiation peaked at a far - ir wavelength .",
    "there is an additional hot component ( @xmath2400 k ) with little mass accounting for the secondary emission bump at mid - ir in the sed , suggesting that a small fraction of dust has been heated by newly - born stars in the immediate surroundings .",
    "the carma observations of the hco@xmath0(1 - 0 ) line confirmed the presence of blue - shifted double - peak line profile towards the w3-se core discovered by @xcite with the iram-30 m .",
    "we made an attempt to fit the line profile with the infall model of @xcite by incorporating outflow components .",
    "the model fitting suggests that in addition to infalling gas , a significant contribution from outflows is necessary to produce the observed line profiles .",
    "the kinematics of the molecular gas in w3-se observed with carma in the central 40@xmath3 region are consistent with a bipolar outflow with a dynamic age of @xmath23@xmath810@xmath9 yr .",
    "finally , based on the observations with carma , sma , and jcmt along with the previous published results , we conclude that w3-se hosts a group of young stars and protostars which are likely located in the double dust cores observed with sma .",

    "<S> line emission shows a main component a that coincides with the dust core , as well as two sub - structures b and c which are located n and se of the dust core , respectively . with the carma observations , </S>",
    "<S> we have verified the presence of a blue - dominated double peak profile toward this core . </S>",
    "<S> the line profile can not be explained by infall alone . </S>",
    "<S> the broad velocity wings of the line profile suggest that other kinematics such as outflows within the central 6@xmath3 of the core likely dominate the resulting spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the kinematics of the sub - structures of b and c suggest that the molecular gas outside the main component a appears to be dominated by the bipolar outflow originated from the dust core with a dynamical age of @xmath73@xmath810@xmath9 yr . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis , based on the observations at wavelengths from millimeter , submillimeter to mid - ir suggests that the molecular core w3-se hosts a group of newly formed young stars and protostars . </S>"
