    "case - control genome - wide association ( gwa ) studies are used to detect associations of disease with genetic markers ( alleles of single nucleotide polymorphisms or snps ) across the genome by comparing with disease ( cases ) to disease - free individuals ( controls ) . a widely accepted approach for identifying and confirming an association is to conduct an initial discovery study to detect promising snps and then to validate the associations in data from independent studies , as , for example , in easton et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . both power calculations ( e.g. , skol et al . , @xcite ) and calculations of the probability of detecting disease - associated snps ( gail et al . , @xcite ) indicate that large numbers of cases and controls are needed for a successful discovery study if one is interested in common alleles with small odds ratios ( e.g. , odds ratio per allele @xmath3 1.2 ) , such as have been found in gwa studies for breast ( easton et al . , @xcite ) and prostate ( yeager et al .",

    "a recent study of diabetes ( zeggini et al . , @xcite ) illustrated that combining data from several studies could improve discovery efforts , compared to the separate analyses of the component studies .",
    "in some diseases , such as thyroid cancer or amyotropic lateral sclerosis ( als ) , it is not possible to accrue large numbers of cases and controls in a single region or study center ; in this context , data will need to be combined for successful discovery . in this paper",
    "we compare several approaches to using data from several smaller gwa studies to discover promising disease - associated snps that require further validation studies .",
    "we compare procedures to combine data from genome - wide association studies both in terms of the power to detect a disease - associated snp while controlling the experiment - wide ( including genome - wide ) significance level , and in terms of the detection probability .",
    "the detection probability is the probability that a particular disease - associated snp will be among the @xmath1 most promising snps selected on the basis of low @xmath2-values ( or high chi - square tests ) .    in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we describe models for disease association , including a fixed effects model that assigns the same log - odds ratio to each disease snp and a random effects model that allows this log - odds ratio to vary across studies . in section  [ sec3 ]",
    "we review the concept of detection probability for a single gwa study and extend the concept for several procedures for combining data from @xmath4 case - control studies .",
    "we also define and compute power for these procedures , while controlling the experiment - wide significance level ( section  [ sec4 ] ) .",
    "section  [ sec5 ] contains numerical results to compare procedures with respect to detection probability and power .",

    "the log - odds ratios for the disease related snps are independent normal variables , @xmath24 @xmath6 .",
    "as tagging snps are typically only markers in linkage disequilibrium ( ld ) with the true causal disease snps , this model captures the impact of variation in ld patterns on @xmath22 across study populations .",
    "we have assumed that log - odds ratios are strictly zero for the @xmath25 nondisease - associated snps .",
    "this `` strong null hypothesis '' is plausible because , if there is no nearby disease snp , then no amount of ld among nearby snps can induce an association between a marker snp and disease .",

    "in ( [ model0 ] ) @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the proportion of cases in the source population that are in the case - control study , and @xmath30 is the analogous proportion for controls .",
    "@xmath31 is the expectation operator .",
    "the null hypothesis of no association for the @xmath12th snp , @xmath32 , can be tested using the wald statistic for a trend in risk with the number of minor alleles , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 denotes the maximum likelihood estimate for model ( [ model0 ] ) and its variance @xmath35 is computed under the retrospective sampling ( gail et al . , @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , one could use the score test for trend ( armitage , @xcite ) . under the null hypotheses of no association , both the wald and the score test",

    "this can be done using a fixed effects model ( mantel and haenszel , @xcite ; yusuf et al . , @xcite ) or a random effects model ( dersimonian and laird , @xcite ) for disease snps .",

    "for the random effects model for the disease - associated snps , @xmath233 , with a small random effects standard deviation , @xmath224 , the estimated power of these procedures was very similar to their power under the fixed effects model ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) . if the random effects standard deviation was @xmath226 , there was enough heterogeneity in association effects across studies that the log odds were positive in some studies and negative in others , leading to a reduction in the meta - analytic summary estimate of association , and to substantial loss in power compared to all other procedures ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) . for example , for @xmath204 with @xmath205 ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) , an expected log - odds ratio of @xmath234 was required to attain 80% power for the meta - analytic approach . on the other hand ,",
    "the sum of wald tests or fishers combination are invariant to sign changes of the effects , and had very high power .",
    "for example , even for mean log - odds ratio @xmath100 , the power of those two procedures was near 80% for @xmath206 with @xmath207 and @xmath204 with @xmath205 .",
    "the combined list procedure also had much higher power than the meta - analytic approaches , for example , 82% for a mean log - odds ratio of @xmath235 for @xmath204 with @xmath205 .",
    "again , for the fixed effects meta - analysis and the random effects meta - analysis with the critical region defined by the @xmath132 quantile , the lines completely overlap and are indistinguishable in figures  [ fig2 ] and  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the power of the liptak ",
    "stouffer combination of @xmath2-values for all settings studied for the figures was very close to the power of the fisher statistic and therefore is not presented . for example , for the fixed effects model presented in figure [ fig1 ] , for an @xmath236 , with @xmath237 cases and @xmath237 controls for @xmath238 studies , the power of the fisher combination was @xmath239 and for the liptak ",
    "stouffer combination was @xmath240 . for @xmath212 cases and @xmath212 controls and @xmath241 studies , the power for an @xmath242 was @xmath243 for fisher s and @xmath244 for the liptak ",
    "stouffer combination of @xmath2-values .",
    "fewer studies with larger sample size ( @xmath245 ) resulted in higher power than more studies with the same total number of subjects ( @xmath206 and @xmath207 ) for all procedures ( with the exception of the meta - analytic approaches , for which the power was the same ) under the fixed effects model and under the random effects model with @xmath229 ( figures  [ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath226 , however , the power of all approaches but the combined list was larger for @xmath206 studies with @xmath207 ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "as is evident from the literature on detection probability ( gail et al .",
    ", @xcite , @xcite ) and power calculations ( skol et al . , @xcite , @xcite ) , large sample sizes are needed to have a good chance to discover disease - associated snps with odds ratios commonly found in gwa studies .",
    "because in many settings the available studies are too small , there is a need to combine information from several studies .",
    "our results indicate that the fixed effects meta - analysis has higher dp than other methods . only when there is severe heterogeneity in association effects across studies such that the log odds is positive in some studies and negative in others can methods such as sum of wald tests or fishers combination of @xmath2-values have larger dp than the fixed effects and random effects meta - analytic approaches .",
    "loughin ( @xcite ) found , in an extensive simulation study of the power of various quantile combinations methods for @xmath2-values , that fisher s method had very good power compared to other transformation functions ( including normal and logistic ) when a minority of the tests provided most of the evidence against the null hypothesis . when signal was distributed equally over all @xmath2-values , the normal transformation proved to be somewhat more powerful than fisher s approach .",
    "we therefore also assessed the performance of the liptak ",
    "stouffer combination of @xmath2-values . in our simulation studies , under both the fixed effects and the random effects model for the disease associated snps ,",
    "fisher s combination of @xmath2-values had higher @xmath0 than the liptak ",
    "stouffer combination of @xmath2-values , but had very similar power .",
    "although differences in ld patterns across populations can result in associations in opposite directions , as illustrated by cdkn1as31r , in the supplement to zeggini et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , in most circumstances the heterogeneity will not be sufficient to render the meta - analytic approaches less powerful than other approaches .",
    "the method of combining lists of promising snps from each of the component studies has the lowest dp in most circumstances , and especially when there are many small studies of comparable size .",
    "our results for power give a similar ranking of procedures to combine information as for dp , despite the fact that these two criteria are far from equivalent ( gail et al . , @xcite ) .",
    "we used the critical values from a one degree - of - freedom chi - square distribution in power calculations for the random effects meta - analytic procedure discussed by dersimonian and laird ( @xcite ) . under the strong null hypothesis",
    "that the log odds is strictly zero , we conducted simulations and verified that such critical values yielded proper size in simulations for @xmath246 and @xmath247 .",
    "it is not certain that the size is nominal for @xmath248 , however , and therefore the power from the random effects meta - analytic approach may not be strictly comparable to that of the fixed effects meta - analysis . if in fact null snps satisfy only a weak null hypothesis , namely , that their log odds have mean zero but vary about this mean , then a critical value based on an @xmath150 distribution might be more appropriate ( follmann and proschan , @xcite ) . using such a critical value reduces power to almost zero , however , as shown in figures  [ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] and  [ fig3 ] . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we argue that a strong null hypothesis is plausible .",
    "we assumed that the same platform was used to analyze the samples in each study and thus that data were available on the same set of snps in each study .",
    "zeggini et al .",
    "( @xcite ) used two algorithms that employed hapmap data to impute missing snps in some studies .",
    "we also assumed that adequate quality control procedures had been followed in all the studies and that there was proper control for population stratification .",
    "otherwise , the assumption of a strong null hypothesis for nondisease - associated snps would not hold .",
    "for ease of exposition we omit the snp specific subscript , and denote ( [ model1 ] ) by @xmath249 for @xmath80 .",
    "the maximum likelihood estimate @xmath194 is found by solving the score equations corresponding to the likelihood ( [ likelihood1 ] ) , @xmath250 where the index @xmath251 refers to the @xmath251th subject in study @xmath8 . the first set of equations corresponds to the study specific intercept parameters , and the last equation corresponds to the common log - odds ratio parameter @xmath60 .",
    "the variance @xmath252 , where @xmath253 are submatrices of the information matrix @xmath254 from the prospective likelihood : @xmath255 ( i_{21})_{j } & = & e(\\partial^2 / \\partial\\mu_j\\ , \\partial\\beta\\log l),\\\\[2pt ] i_{22 } & = & -e(\\partial^2 / \\partial^2 \\beta\\log l ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the expectations of the second derivatives and cross - derivatives of the prospective log - likelihood are taken with respect to retrospective sampling distributions @xmath256 and @xmath257 , for cases and controls respectively .",
    "as the studies are independent , @xmath258 is a diagonal matrix with the expected second derivatives of the study specific intercept parameters on the diagonal .",
    "thus , the information matrix reduces to @xmath259 the variance for @xmath194 is then given by @xmath260\\\\[-8pt ] & = & \\biggl\\ { \\sum_{s=1}^s [ i_{22,s } - i_{21,s } ( i_{11,s})^{-1 } i_{12,s } ] \\biggr\\}^{-1}.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for @xmath261 ( [ var1 ] ) reduces to the standard case - control variance , @xmath262      recall that @xmath263 where @xmath264 and , thus , @xmath265 . using ( [ fisher ] ) for a single study , @xmath266 where @xmath267 stands for the study specific fisher information matrix .",
