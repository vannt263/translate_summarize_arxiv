    ", there is a smaller chance of contamination from other sources of light in the system .",
    "while modeling several light curves from one wavelength regime helps to constrain model parameters , simultaneously modeling light curves that span more than one wavelength regime provides tighter constraints than modeling ir light curves alone .",
    "previous inclination estimates for xte j1118 + 480 have come from modeling optical ellipsoidal variations as the system approached quiescence @xcite .",
    "these inclination angles range from 55@xmath11  @xcite to 83@xmath11  @xcite , and correspond to primary masses of 10 m@xmath15 and 6.0 m@xmath15 , respectively .",
    "since this system has been known to exhibit optical superhumps from the precession of an eccentric accretion disk on its way to quiescence @xcite , it is important to determine the orbital inclination angle while xte j1118 + 480 is in a truly quiescent state .    in order to determine an accurate orbital inclination angle for xte j1118 + 480 , we have obtained @xmath16- , @xmath17- , @xmath18- , @xmath0- , @xmath1- , and @xmath2-band light curves of the system while in quiescence , and",

    "table  [ obstab ] summarizes our observations , while we describe them in detail below .",
    "we obtained optical observations of xte j1118 + 480 over three nights in 2003 and four nights in 2004 using standard johnson @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 filters with the 1.5 m telescope at the tbitak national observatory ( tug ) in antalya , turkey .",
    "the data were obtained with the imaging ccd on 2003 june 4 - 6 and the andor ccd on 2004 march 18 - 19 and 2004 april 23 - 24 .",
    "a total of 31 , 84 , and 83 images were obtained in the @xmath16- , @xmath17- and @xmath18-bands , respectively .",
    "the data were reduced with bias frames , dark current frames , and dome flat fields using standard procedures .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes of xte j1118 + 480 were derived through the use of the psf fitting algorithms , daophot @xcite and allstar in the midas software package using fifteen psf stars .",
    "in addition , a reference star ( @xmath19=11:18:07.10 and @xmath20=+48:03:53.2 ) close to our transient source was used to reduce the scintillation effects and derive the calibrated magnitudes for a given filter .",
    "the reference star and target star errors were added in quadrature to produce the final errors on the photometric points .",
    "the resulting data were combined into 20 bins per orbit .",
    "infrared data on xte j1118 + 480 were obtained on 2003 january 17 and 18 using sqiid ( simultaneous quad infrared imaging device ) on the 2.1 meter telescope at kitt peak national observatory .",
    "we simultaneously obtained measurements in the @xmath0- , @xmath1- , and @xmath2-bands and kept the number of counts in each exposure in the linear regime of each chip .",
    "the data were reduced using tasks in the _ upsqiid _ package in iraf .",
    "the images taken at one position were subtracted from the images taken at a slightly offset position to remove the sky , dark current , and any bias level .",

    "aperture photometry was performed on xte j1118 + 480 and five nearby field stars . using the iraf",
    "_ phot _ package , a differential light curve for each band was generated .",
    "we followed standard error propagation rules for calculating the differential magnitude errors from the target and reference star instrumental magnitudes .",
    "the differential photometric results show that over the course of our observations , the comparison stars did not vary more than expected from photon statistics .",

    ", there was no evidence of a superhump period when the data were run through a periodogram .",
    "these results are consistent with the findings of @xcite whose optical data taken on 2003 june suggested that if a superhump modulation existed , it was at the @xmath210.50@xmath22 level . @xcite also observed stochastic variability and fast flares in their light curves .",
    "however , the observed stochastic variability had the same magnitude as their photometric error bars , and despite the significant power in the power density spectrum , the flares seen in xte  j1118 + 480 had roughly the same magnitude as the spread in the comparison star measurements .",
    "the 2003 and 2004 @xmath17- and @xmath18-band light curves presented here were consistent in shape and amplitude .",
    "as table [ obstab ] shows , two thirds of the nights that xte  j1118 + 480 was observed , data was gathered for at least 75% of an orbit , with more than one full orbit covered on four of the nine nights .",
    "no evidence for unequal maxima , flares , or light curve distortions were found in the unphased data .",
    "the periodogram results are consistent with the results from @xcite and therefore all data presented here have been phased to their ephemeris .",
    "these are the first @xmath1- and @xmath2-band detections of ellipsoidal variations from this x - ray binary system .",
    "the spectral type of the secondary star can be estimated by comparing its red optical spectrum with the spectra of stars with various spectral types from the same luminosity class .",
    "alternatively , one can use a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , and published limits on the spectral type to not only derive an effective temperature of the secondary star , but to also estimate both the visual extinction and contamination level .",
    "given that photometric data usually has a higher s / n than spectroscopic data , an effective temperature derived using photometry can be just as useful as a spectral type derived from a spectroscopic data set . to this end , we compared the observed optical / ir ( @xmath23 ) sed for xte j1118 + 480 with the observed seds for k0v  m4v stars @xcite .",
    "we present the best fitting sed in figure [ fig3 ] , and find that it predicts a visual extinction of a@xmath24=0.065@xmath50.020 mags , and a secondary star spectral type of k7v .",
    "it also includes 60  70% light from the accretion disk at @xmath16 and 30  35% at @xmath17 .",
    "a k5v gives a slightly worse fit , and predicts more @xmath18-band light than is observed , as well as a smaller amount of disk light in the @xmath16- and @xmath17-bands , inconsistent with previously published values .",

    "light from the primary object or accretion disk in an x - ray binary will act to dilute the amplitude of the ellipsoidal variations of the secondary star .",
    "@xcite estimate that the secondary star in the xte j1118 + 480 system contributes roughly 55% of the total flux between 5800  and 6400 ; however , at @xmath18 = 18.6 , the system was not in true quiescence when their observations were taken .",
    "@xcite determined that xte j1118 + 480 has a true quiescent @xmath18-band magnitude of 18.9 .",
    "the optical data presented here ( @xmath18=19.00 ) are consistent with this value , and thus we contend that the system was in a quiescent state during our observations . in addition , doppler imaging of the system did not detect any h@xmath19 emission from a hot spot or accretion stream @xcite .",
    "since our observations took place while xte j1118 + 480 was in true quiescence , the optical data presented here are consistent with both of the @xcite results .",
    "the most difficult contamination source to extract in the case of xte j1118 + 480 is the one that has the shallowest spectral slope .",
    "if the disk contamination in the infrared is based on the assumption that the optically thin disk radiates through free - free emission processes , and we therefore ascribe the entire @xmath17-band excess to free - free emission , then in the @xmath2-band , the contamination would be @xmath27 8% .",
    "an 8% contamination in the infrared bands would cause the observed orbital inclination angle of the system to be underestimated by 2@xmath11 .",
    "what if we instead assume that any ir contamination is ascribed to a jet or some form of an advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) ? models by @xcite for xte  j1118 + 480 in quiescence show that both the jet and adaf flux in the ir are predicted to constitute significantly less than 8% of the companion flux .",
    "irradiation of the secondary star by the accretion disk will affect the symmetry of the ellipsoidal light curves .",
    "@xcite investigated the possibility of x - ray irradiation powering the h@xmath19 emission seen in their doppler tomograms of the xte j1118 + 480 system .",
    "they concluded that it was improbable that this could be the case , and found that the strength of the h@xmath19 emission from the secondary star was comparable with other k dwarfs .",
    "similarly , we see no significant evidence for irradiation effects in the unphased data or the light curves presented here .    as in @xcite , we simultaneously modeled the optical and infrared light curves of xte j1118 + 480 with wd98 @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for references and a basic description of the code , and @xcite for a more comprehensive description .",
    "the data were run through wd98 s dc program which uses a simplex algorithm for initial parameter searches and a damped least squares algorithm for error minimization between the data and model light curves .",
    "we ran the code for a semi - detached binary with the primary component s gravitational potential set so that all of its mass is concentrated at a point .",
    "the most important wavelength - independent input values to wd98 are listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the models were run for a range of inclination angles with parameters for a k3v through an m1v secondary star .",
    "the secondary star atmosphere was determined from solar - metallicity kurucz models .",
    "we used normal , non - irradiated , square - root limb darkening coefficients @xcite .",
    "we also adopted gravity darkening exponents found by @xcite , and mass ratios ranging from @xmath28 = 0.030 - 0.056 @xcite .",
    "we assumed that the secondary star was not exhibiting any star spots during our observations .",
    "the models were run with varying amounts of additional light in all bands . solving for six consistent light curve solutions simultaneously allowed the rejection of many disk light scenarios .    with 118 degrees of freedom , the best fit model had a reduced @xmath29 of 1.65 .",
    "while the error on the best fit inclination angle was dependent on combining the uncertainties from varying all of the model parameters simultaneously , we found that changing the spectral type of the secondary from a k5v to an m1v resulted in a change in the orbital inclination angle of 1@xmath11 .",
    "similarly , varying @xmath28 from 0.030 to 0.056 affected @xmath30 by @xmath31 .",
    "we find that the best fitting @xmath16- , @xmath17- , @xmath18- , @xmath0- , @xmath1- , and @xmath2-band model has @xmath30 = 68@xmath11 , and the parameters found in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "figure 1 presents this model for the optical bands , while figure [ fig2 ] presents this model for the @xmath0- , @xmath1- , and @xmath2-band light curves .      based on our optical / ir sed , as well as published values ,",
    "we adopt a secondary star spectral type of k7 @xcite with a temperature of @xmath32 = 4250 k @xcite .",
    "the corresponding gravity darkening exponent is @xmath33 = 0.34 .",
    "modeling six light curves simultaneously is a robust method for constraining the amount of extra light in the system .",
    "if we model the light curves individually and assume that all of the light in the system comes from the secondary star , the best fitting orbital inclination angle for xte j1118 + 480 varies with wavelength .",
    "since the contaminating light does not have the same spectrum as the secondary star the light curves at each wavelength are diluted by different amounts , causing the best fit inclination for the affected bands to be different from the others .",
    "this is the case for the @xmath16- and @xmath17-band light curves .",
    "if a jet or other contaminant were to have a flat spectrum that only affected the ir , the results from the sed would most likely not match those obtained from spectral measurements , and we would not be able to determine a reasonable parameter set and inclination angle that is consistent throughout the data .",
    "when fit simultaneously , the best fit inclination angle is @xmath30 = 68@xmath11 with 62% disk light in @xmath16 , and 31% disk light in @xmath17 .",
    "these disk light contributions are consistent with those found through the sed fitting .",
    "using an estimate of 8% for the infrared accretion disk contamination in the system gives an inclination of 68@xmath34@xmath11 , however , if we artificially add in 8% or more infrared light , we are unable to obtain a reasonable solution for the orbital inclination angle that is consistent throughout the entire data set . therefore , based on the ir colors of the system ( @xmath0-@xmath35=1.1@xmath50.3 ) , the sed fit , and the results of the simultaneous light curve modeling , it appears unlikely that the infrared light curves are significantly affected by any such contamination . in order to determine the final error on the orbital inclination angle",
    ", we plotted the @xmath29 values as a function of @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , based on the error in each of the model parameters including @xmath28 , the spectral type ( i.e. temperature ) of the secondary star , the amount of observed disk light , as well as the photometric error bars , the orbital inclination angle is 68@xmath11@xmath52@xmath11 .",
    "we combined the determined inclination angle with the orbital period ( p = 0.1699167 @xmath5 1.72@xmath3610@xmath37",
    "d ) , radial velocity of the secondary star ( k@xmath38 = 709 @xmath5 7 km ; @xcite ) , and and the mass ratio ( @xmath28 = 0.0435 @xmath5 0.0100 ) to find the mass of the primary object . a monte carlo routine was used to propagate the errors on the above quantities and gives a primary mass of 8.53@xmath50.60 m@xmath15 , confirming it as a black hole .",
    "the constraints on the mass of the black hole in this system presented here represent a considerable improvement over those previously published .",
    "@xcite determined a mass of 6.0  7.7 m@xmath15 from data obtained before xte 1118 + 480 had entered a quiescent state ( @xmath3918.3 ) .",
    "@xcite gave an upper limit of @xmath40 10 m@xmath15 , and more recently , @xcite adopted a mass of @xmath27 8 m@xmath15 for their calculations of the thermal emission from the black hole in the system .",
    "the 8.53 m@xmath15 black hole mass determined here is consistent with the adopted mass of @xcite , and falls nicely into the current observed black hole mass distribution .",
    "theoretical models by @xcite predict that there should exist a greater number of 3  5 m@xmath15 black holes than 5  12 m@xmath15 black holes ; however , most of the determined black hole masses thus far have fallen into a 6  14 m@xmath15 range .",
    "in fact , thus far , gro j0422 + 32 is the only system with a compact object that falls into the 3  5 m@xmath15 range ( * ? ? ?",
    "* m@xmath15 )",
    ".    using the mass of the compact object and the orbital period , we computed the orbital separation of the two components in the system .",
    "we then combined the separation with the mass ratio to find the size of the roche lobe for the secondary star .",
    "the temperature of the secondary and its roche lobe radius were then used to find the secondary s bolometric luminosity and bolometric absolute magnitude . after accounting for the bolometric correction @xcite ,",
    "the distance modulus for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 bands were used to find an average distance of 1.72@xmath50.10 kpc .",
    "consistent with results from the modeling and sed fitting , this calculation assumes that all of the ir light in the system originates from the secondary star .",
    "table  [ tab2 ] lists all of the derived parameters for the xte  j1118 + 480 system .",
    "both the mass and radius of the secondary star are smaller than that of a k7v zams star . in addition , the infrared colors of the system and its position in the galactic halo , support the notion that the secondary star in the xte j1118 + 480 system may be evolved .",
    "in this paper , we have presented the first observed @xmath1- and @xmath35-band ellipsoidal variations , as well as the first @xmath16- , @xmath17- , and @xmath18-band ellipsoidal variations observed while xte  j1118 + 480 was in a truly quiescent state .",
    "the derived parameters in table  [ tab2 ] are based on the modeling of these variations including disk contributions of 62% in the @xmath16-band and 31% in the @xmath17-band .",
    "consistent with @xcite and @xcite , we do not see evidence for any optical superhump light or irradiation in the system .",
    "this supports the the fact that the system was in a truly quiescent state during our observations .    while the orbital inclination angle found here is lower than that found by groups who optically studied the system while approaching quiescence and exhibiting superhumps ( * ? ? ?",
