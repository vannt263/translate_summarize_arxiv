    "the oriented hypergraphic analogue of a signed graph with all edges labeled @xmath0 is to have all adjacencies signed @xmath0 .",

    "that is , not only do we require a uniformly oriented hypergraph , but one where every incidence is given the same sign . in first case , all incidences of @xmath12 are assigned @xmath0 , so that all adjacencies are signed @xmath1 , producing the oriented hypergraph @xmath238 . in the second case ,",

    "the _ adjacency matrix of a hypergraph @xmath12 _ is defined as @xmath240 the _ laplacian matrix of a hypergraph @xmath12 _ is defined as @xmath241 these choices result in adjacency and laplacian matrices that almost resemble the adjacency and laplacian matrices developed by rodrguez @xcite .",
    "however , since our adjacency entries will always be negative , our definition of the adjacency matrix is actually the negative of rodrguez s .",
    "the laplacian matrix can then be produced under this assumption .",
    "for these special cases the results of rodrguez @xcite could naturally be generalized .",
    "one advantage of these definitions for the adjacency and laplacian matrices of a hypergraph is that there is no requirement for the hypergraph to be @xmath28-uniform , which has been the case for most hypergraph spectra definitions @xcite .",
    "another advantage is that these matrices are algebraically simpler to work with than hypermatrices , which provide an alternative version of hypergraph spectra for @xmath28-uniform hypergraphs @xcite .",
    "nikiforov states in @xcite that this version of hypergraph spectra  is defined as a conditional maximum ; thus , its usability in extremal problems is rooted in its very nature .",
    "\" none of the bounds above involve extremal problems , but it would be interesting to see if these definitions could be used to solve such problems .",

    "are related to theorems 3.8 and 3.9 in @xcite , but the theorems presented here are valid for all hypergraphs ( including oriented hypergraphs ) , and not just @xmath28-uniform hypergraphs .",
