    "in our experiment , the transverse laser field acts simultaneously as a pump field controlling the long - range interactions @xcite .",
    "this field has a frequency @xmath8 and a wavevector @xmath17 , and is in a standing - wave configuration directed perpendicularly to the cavity mode .",
    "it is far detuned from atomic resonance to avoid electronic excitation of the atoms . at the same time",
    ", it is detuned by only a few cavity linewidths from the cavity resonance , which enables vacuum - stimulated scattering of pump photons into the cavity mode at wavevector @xmath18 .",
    "these two - photon processes mediate long - range atom - atom interactions in the bec , giving rise to a roton - like mode softening @xcite and a structural phase transition @xcite .",
    "the same two - photon processes are exploited for detection .",
    "the light scattered from the transverse pump field into the cavity mode can be regarded as a superposition of all field amplitudes scattered by the individual atoms .",
    "it thus carries information on the density - density correlations of the gas at the wavevectors @xmath19 , which are determined by the underlying two - photon processes @xcite . within the cavity linewidth , which is two orders of magnitude larger than the frequency of the relevant quasi - particle excitation , the energies of the photons stimulated into the vacuum mode",
    "are not fixed .",
    "this is in contrast to bragg spectroscopy , where the energy of the quasi - particle excitations that are created during probing is determined by the frequency difference of the classical fields driving the two - photon processes .",
    "the spectral analysis of the light field leaking out of the cavity thus gives us direct access to the dynamic structure factor at finite temperatures .",
    "as previously described @xcite , we trap a bec of @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22rb atoms at the center of an ultrahigh - finesse optical fabry - prot cavity and illuminate it by the transverse pump field .",
    "the cavity - mediated interaction leads to the formation of a quasi - particle mode , which is a superposition of the collective momentum excitation at wavevectors @xmath23 of the bec and a tiny admixture of photons inside the cavity ( see supplementary note 1 ) . neglecting atom - atom collisions",
    ", its energy @xmath24 equals in the limit of zero pump power @xmath25 the bare energy @xmath26 of a single momentum excitation and decreases with increasing power @xcite , where @xmath27 denotes the atomic mass .",
    "due to this mode softening , the energy @xmath24 of the quasi - particle mode approaches zero at a critical pump power @xmath28 , which leads to a phase transition from a normal state with a flat density distribution to a self - organized state with checkerboard density modulation .",
    "the emergent density structure leads to elastic scattering of transverse pump light and a macroscopic population of the cavity mode .",
    "an order parameter of this phase transition is the expectation value of the operator @xmath29 describing the overlap of the atomic density @xmath30 and the checkerboard mode structure , @xmath31 .    .",
    "the fluctuation data is extracted from the dynamic structure factor ( see fig .",
    "2 ) by integrating over the fit function describing the sidebands and is proportional to the static structure factor .",
    "the coherent density modulation is calculated from the power spectral density at the zero frequency bin .",
    "the vertical error bars display the statistical error ( s. d. ) from the fit , while the horizontal error bars display the standard deviation in our determination of the critical point .",
    "the inset displays a double logarithmic plot to demonstrate the scaling behavior of the variance of the density fluctuations against the distance to the critical point , expressed as the hamiltonian coupling parameter @xmath32 ( see supplementary note 1 ) . from a linear fit",
    ", we find critical exponents of 0.7(1 ) and 1.1(1 ) on the normal and self - organized side , respectively .",
    "the open symbols in the inset are used for the fitting . ]      as the cavity decay rate @xmath33{mhz}$ ] is more than two orders of magnitude faster than the evolution rate @xmath34 of the coupled system , the light field @xmath35 inside the cavity adiabatically follows the order parameter , @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the frequency spectrum of the light leaking out of the cavity thus reveals the temporal and spatial fourier transform of the atomic density correlations , evaluated at one particular wavevector .",
    "specifically , the dynamic structure factor of the system at wavevector @xmath23 is related to the cavity field according to @xmath37 where @xmath7 is the frequency shift of the cavity output field from the pump light frequency @xmath8 due to inelastic scattering .",
    "@xmath16 is the power spectral density of the intra - cavity light field with mean coherent field amplitude @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is the two - photon rabi - frequency of the scattering process , proportional to @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath41{mhz}$ ] is the detuning between the pump laser frequency and the dispersively shifted cavity resonance ( see supplementary note 1 ) .    to analyze the light field leaking out of the cavity , we use a balanced heterodyne detection scheme @xcite .",
    "figure 2 shows the power spectral density @xmath16 of the light field as we linearly increase the transverse pump power @xmath25 across the critical point .",
    "the rate of change of @xmath9 is a few hertz , such that the system can be assumed to adiabatically follow its steady state throughout the measurement @xcite .",
    "the small panels in fig .",
    "2 show examples of @xmath14 for different values of @xmath9 , converted via eq .",
    "( [ eq : structure_factor ] ) and normalized to unity for the non - interacting case @xcite . the data reflects the microscopic processes taking place : pump photons of frequency @xmath8 inelastically scattered at the atomic ensemble will be shifted in their frequency .",
    "they become visible as red ( blue ) sideband at frequency @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) if they create ( annihilate ) a quasi - particle .",
    "we observe the corresponding sidebands whose frequency shift tends to zero when approaching the critical point at @xmath44 from either side of the phase transition .",
    "these density fluctuations can be distinguished from a checkerboard density modulation at @xmath23 at which pump photons will be elastically scattered without a frequency shift , visible at @xmath12 .",
    "intuitively this light field arises from scattering at bragg planes in the density modulated cloud .",
    "the transverse pump power @xmath25 influences not only the effective long - range interactions in the system , but also the measurement process itself . for increasing pump power",
    ", the measurement imprecision due to the shot noise of the transverse pump field becomes less relevant , as can be seen from the decreasing background level of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the influence of the inevitable measurement backaction will be discussed further below .",
    "the total power of elastically scattered light is proportional to the square of the density modulation @xmath45 , and is displayed as open symbols in fig .",
    "this coherent density modulation increases over five orders of magnitude while crossing the critical point . in the normal phase ( @xmath46 ) , we also observe a weak field at the pump laser frequency ( i.e. at @xmath12 ) , which originates from a small symmetry breaking field caused by the finite size of the system and residual scattering of the transverse pump beam at the cavity mirrors @xcite .",
    "the total power of frequency - shifted light is proportional to the variance of the checkerboard density fluctuation @xmath47 , and thus to the static structure factor @xmath48 .",
    "we show the variance of density fluctuations as filled symbols in fig . 3 , and observe a divergence when approaching the critical point @xmath44 from either side , heralding a second - order phase transition .",
    "the inset displays the variance of the density fluctuations on a double logarithmic plot to illustrate the scaling behavior .",
    "the variance is plotted as a function of the hamiltonian coupling parameter @xmath32 , derived from measured quantities and using a theoretical model ( see supplementary note 1 ) . in the normal and the self - organized phase we extract critical exponents of 0.7(1 ) and 1.1(1 ) , respectively .",
    "we attribute the deviation from our previous measurement in the normal phase , which gave 0.9(1 ) @xcite , to the refined model used for the scaling of the horizontal axis and the improved measurement scheme that allows us to directly distinguish between density fluctuations and a density modulation .",
    "current theoretical research taking into account the open character of the system due to cavity dissipation predicts an exponent of 1.0 @xcite .",
    "the difference between the experimentally observed exponent and the predicted value might originate from finite size effects and the presence of a small symmetry breaking field .",
    "further , the theory models do not include damping of the momentum excitation due to atom - atom collisions @xcite .",

    "the access to the dynamic structure factor @xmath14 allows us to characterize the quasi - particle mode which emerges due to the long - range interactions in the gas .",
    "when adiabatically switching on the long - range interactions ( @xmath51 ) , new quasi - particle modes of polaritonic character form , where intra - cavity photons are admixed to the recoil momentum states .",
    "a diagonalization of the hamiltonian for @xmath51 leads to the definition of a quasi - particle mode for the interacting system with annihilation and creation operators @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively ( supplementary note 1 ) . from our measurements , fig",
    "2 , we can directly extract the energy @xmath24 of this quasi - particle mode as a function of @xmath9 . to this end",
    ", we fit a resonance curve of a damped harmonic oscillator to both sidebands of @xmath14 ( supplementary note 2 ) , whose peak positions corresponds to @xmath34 , see fig .",

    "the main constituent of the quasi - particle mode is the atomic component , while the light field is only weakly admixed .",
    "we thus attribute the observed damping mainly to the decay of atomic momentum excitations .",
    "the finite decay rate @xmath54 of the cavity light field gives rise to an additional damping of the quasi - particle mode estimated to be only a few hertz ( supplementary note 1 ) .",
    "the behavior of the damping rate @xmath49 has been studied theoretically and originates from a resonant enhancement of the beliaev damping of the checkerboard density - wave @xcite .",

    "the grey shaded area shows the result from an _ ab initio _ calculation of the expected quasi - particle mode occupation ( supplementary notes 1 and 3 ) , taking into account the experimental uncertainties in the determination of the coherent cavity field and the depth of the optical lattice resulting from the transverse pump field . shown as black dashed line is the calculated thermal occupation @xmath55 of the quasi - particle mode due to the finite temperature of the bec for a temperature of .",
    "vertical and horizontal errorbars indicate the statistical error ( s. d. ) reported from the fit , and the error in the determination of the critical point ( s. d. ) , respectively .",
    "the strongly increased vertical errorbars close to @xmath44 arise from the decreasing sideband asymmetry , while their individual errors stay roughly constant . ]",
    "the occupation @xmath56 of the quasi - particle mode can be extracted from the observed sideband asymmetry . as can be seen in fig .",
    "2 , the red - shifted sideband dominates over the blue - shifted one . for a system in its ground state , only creation processes",
    "are possible , leading to a vanishing blue - shifted sideband .",
    "this has been used for thermometry of trapped ions and cavity optomechanical systems @xcite . from the observation of the finite blue - shifted sideband in our experiment",
    "we infer that the system is in a steady state close to its ground state .",
    "the continuous measurement process via cavity decay constantly creates and annihilates quasi - particles at rates @xmath57 and @xmath58 . here , @xmath59 is the integrated spectral weight of the blue ( @xmath60 ) and red ( @xmath61 ) sideband , respectively .",
    "this measurement backaction effectively gives rise to a heating rate of the system , and thus to a finite occupation of the quasi - particle mode . at the same time , the finite decay rate @xmath49 of the quasi - particle mode changes this occupation : on one hand , quasi - particles will be annihilated due to this dissipation channel at rate @xmath62 . on the other hand , it couples the quasi - particle mode to a thermal heat bath provided by the atomic cloud .",
    "this creates quasiparticles at rate @xmath63 , where @xmath55 is the thermal occupation of the quasi - particle mode calculated from the bose distribution function , and @xmath64{nk}$ ] is the temperature of the bec , measured independently from absorption images . in steady state ,",
    "the different contributions are balanced according to the rate equation ( see supplementary note 1 and supplementary figure 1 ) , @xmath65    we can determine the occupation @xmath66 of the quasi - particle mode , using the weights of the sidebands and the dissipation rates @xmath49 ( empirical fit ) and @xmath54 ( see fig .",
    "we observe an average occupation of the quasi - particle mode on the level of only a few quanta . in the organized phase an increase of the mode occupation towards the critical point seems visible .",
    "the occupation is expected to diverge when approaching the critical point since the energy of the soft mode vanishes and the atomic damping rate goes to zero @xcite .",
    "this situation is very similar to the enhanced thermal occupation of roton - like states predicted for dilute quantum gases with dipolar interactions at finite temperatures @xcite .",
    "we used vacuum - stimulated scattering of light to directly measure the dynamic structure factor of a quantum gas with cavity - mediated long - range interactions .",
    "access to the dynamic structure factor allowed us to characterize the relevant quasi - particle mode while the system crossed a structural phase transition , to distinguish density modulation and density fluctuations , and to measure the critical exponents of the density fluctuations .",
    "we further extracted the finite occupancy of the quasi - particle mode under the influence of measurement backaction due to cavity decay and an atomic bath at finite temperature . while this measurement was motivated by the very specific setup used to create cavity - mediated long - range interactions , an extension to more general settings seems possible .",
    "the approach of applying quantum optical methods based on strong matter - light interaction to the investigation of dilute ultracold gases offers unique possibilities for the non - destructive real - time investigation of quantum matter and its phase transitions @xcite .",
