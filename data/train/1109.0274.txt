    "there is a way to get around the problem of nonexistence of gibbs measures in the presence of wave collapse , so in section [ pt ] we discuss new results for the gibbs measures of the 3d discrete nls , where there is a striking phase transition to soliton - like behavior .",

    "weinstein proved one of the conjectures in the supercritical case , that ground state standing waves exist if and only if the total power is larger than some strictly positive threshold  @xcite , called the excitation threshold , which is characterized by variational methods .    in order to make this precise ,",

    "moreover , there will be a phase transition as the mass and the temperature are varied : for low values of mass or inverse temperature , the states that are highly probable are small states with negligible energies .",
    "but then there s a sudden jump at a critical threshold of mass or inverse temperature to highly probable localized states with negative energies , in fact bounded away from zero .",
    "related work of malomed and weinstein used this same variational approach to analyze the dynamics of solitons in the 1d discrete nls : for nonlinearities up to about cubic , there is a unique soliton of large width and no excitation threshold . for nonlinearities in a medium range between cubic and quintic , there is no threshold and there are three solitons , one unstable and two stable ( in sharp contrast to the situation for the continuous nls ) . and for nonlinearities above quintic there is an excitation threshold for the solitons , one of which is stable and highly localized , and the other unstable and wide @xcite .",
    "weinstein also made a conjecture in @xcite about the subthreshold behavior , that if @xmath48 for the solution @xmath28 of the discrete nls , then @xmath28 disperses to zero , in the sense that : @xmath49.\\ ] ] this conjecture has been addressed by similar adaptations of pde methods to the discrete nls by stefanov and kevrekidis , who proved the following decay and strichartz - type estimates for discrete schrdinger ( and klein - gordon ) equations .",

    "the decay here is not as fast as for the continuous schrdinger decay estimates ( which is of order @xmath66 ) , but it is sharp in the discrete setting .",

    "but this uniform smallness of the solution for small initial data happens only when the nonlinearity is more than just supercritical ( @xmath78 rather than @xmath79 ) .",
    "there are two scaling limits of the discrete schrdinger equation that are of interest .",
    "one is the _ continuum limit _ alluded to earlier , of sending the lattice spacing @xmath19 to zero . in this limit ,",
    "at least in one and two dimensions , one obtains the continuous nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "another limit is the _ anti - integrable _ or _ anti - continuum _ limit , resulting in an infinite system of decoupled odes by sending @xmath19 to infinity , for instance , or equivalently sending the total power @xmath80 to infinity . in this case ,",
    "ground states become concentrated on the lattice at a single site @xcite , and their spectral properties and stability issues have been studied extensively @xcite .",
    "( an interesting thing will happen for the statistical mechanics of the continuum limit in three dimensions , however , because the nonlinearity is supercritical there and thus dominates the kinetic energy , making the coupling effectively negligible and producing behavior similar to the anti - continuum limit in that states typically localize at a single site . )    for instance , kevrekidis , pelinovsky , and stefanov @xcite build on the previous dispersive decay estimates of @xcite , in order to prove asymptotic stability of the ground states under some assumptions on the spectrum of the linearization of the dnls equation with external potential in 1d : @xmath81 because of the slower rate of decay in the @xmath82 norm of solutions to the discrete schrdinger equations [ sk ] , the critical power of the nonlinearity is @xmath83 in place of the continuous schrdinger equation s critical power @xmath84 , and @xcite does not handle the cubic case @xmath15 .",

    "then in the limit as @xmath107 goes to infinity , @xmath108 converges , and the radiation part @xmath109 vanishes in @xmath82 .",
    "this is a nice asymptotic stability result , but what s more remarkable is that something similar happens in a continuum limit of high - dimensional ( @xmath110 ) finite lattices called the _ thermodynamic _ limit , sending @xmath19 to zero and simultaneously taking the total mass ( power divided by number of lattice sites ) to be fixed ( i.e. , sending power to infinity in particular way ) . in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "one can find a critical threshold above which one obtains states concentrated states at a single site , at least with high probability .",
    "in pure physics applications like optics and bose - einstein condensation , the nls is the model , but in the context of biophysics where particle interactions can be long - range , the natural model turns out to be a schrdinger equation with fractional - order laplacian .",
    "an example is modeling electron transport in dna @xcite . on dna , and other macromolecules with complicated helical structures , electrons or excitations",
    "can propagate along the strand in a very non - local way .",
    "mathematically , these phenomena are just beginning to be explored .",
    "the usual questions about well - posedness and solitons are interesting for the fractional nls , and in fact , there is a corresponding discrete system whose solitons have been studied numerically and whose continuum limit is the predicted fractional nls .",
    "work on the fractional pdes has been done by @xcite , on fractional nls specifically by @xcite , and on the related benjamin - ono equation by @xcite .",

    "explicit solitary wave solutions for this discrete fractional nls have been studied in the biophysics literature .",
    "for instance , gaididei et al .",
    "@xcite make the ansatz @xmath124 , with localized state : @xmath125 the parameter @xmath126 representing the inverse `` width '' of the soliton and @xmath127 determining its location . numerically studying the associated variational problem , and minimizing @xmath128 under the power constraint @xmath129 ,",
    "they find two kinds of localized states , one called  on - site \" with @xmath130 and one  inter - site \" with @xmath131 , depending on the value of the inverse power parameter @xmath132 .",
    "for on - site states with cubic nonlinearity , there appears to be a critical value @xmath133 , estimated to be near @xmath134 , above which the dispersive interaction decays fast enough that the behavior is qualitatively like that of the nearest - neighbor approximation , or traditional discrete nls . and below the critical value @xmath133 , they find three bistable localized states , one low - frequency wide state and two high - frequency narrow states @xcite . on the other hand , inter - site states with cubic nonlinearity",
    "are not so well understood , and they find a lower critical value @xmath135 and a smaller regime @xmath136 in which there are two stable inter - site states . in both cases , the dependence of the power on the frequency of the localized states is studied .",
    "gaididei et al . also present the continuum version of these nonlocal models , with @xmath137 solving the fractional nls of the form : @xmath138 with @xmath139 , a constant @xmath140 depending only on @xmath132 , and @xmath141 depending on @xmath132 appropriately . in the biophysics literature , this limit @xmath142 is routinely taken without mathematically rigorous arguments , but rigor is forthcoming with the result as follows @xcite .",
    "we consider the cubic interaction @xmath143 for simplicity , but this can be generalized to other nonlinearities @xmath8 , and we consider the inverse power law decay in , but this can be generalized to other interaction kernels in @xcite that fall into asymptotic classes with behavior substantively similar to the kernel in with parameter @xmath132 .",
    "the result is that if we are given a family of initial data for the discrete evolution problems , @xmath144 , that approximate a sufficiently smooth initial datum for the fractional nls , then the solutions of the discrete equations converge in an appropriate weak sense to the solution of the fractional nls , with the fractional power of the laplacian : @xmath145    in other words , the critical value is exactly @xmath146 ( not too far from the numerical results in @xcite ) below which the long - range interactions produce a nonlocal fractional nls in the continuum limit , with laplacian of order @xmath147 . above the critical threshold ,",
    "the interaction strength decays so quickly that only local effects survive in the continuum limit , which is exactly the ",
    "classical \" local nls , @xmath148 . and at the threshold",
    ", we get the classical nls in the continuum limit , with a logarithmic factor appearing in some scaling constants .    for this continuum limit result",
    ", we develop fractional discrete sobolev - type inequalities in the discrete setting , uniform embedding , interpolation , and _ a priori _ estimates , and finally for the limit itself , suitable weak compactness arguments .",
    "it would be nice also to obtain rigorous results about the solitary wave states from the biophysics literature and their stability for both the discrete and continuous long - range systems , and these long - range nls systems should be amenable to the statistical mechanics approach discussed next .",
    "adapting tools from the theory of pdes like variational methods and strichartz estimates has been useful for understanding the discrete nls and its localized soliton states , but it is nice to get beyond standard existence results to generic behavior . by setting up the gibbs measure , or statistical ensemble , which is a probability measure on the space of all solutions , we can tell which behaviors are typical in a probabilistic sense .    _ gibbs measures _ , or _ invariant measures",
    "_ , are based on normalizing the boltzmann distribution , so that the probability of finding the system in state @xmath0 is : @xmath149 here @xmath150 is the inverse temperature , sometimes replaced by @xmath151 , which makes temperature @xmath152 explicit using the boltzmann constant @xmath153 .",
    "and @xmath154 is the normalizing constant , also known as the partition function , which encodes statistical properties of the system ( in particular the free energy as we ll see in section [ zf ] ) . for dynamical systems such as the nls",
    ", the energy @xmath128 is conserved by the dynamics , so that we can invoke the liouville theorem to see that the measure is invariant .",
    "the intuition behind the boltzmann distribution can be understood by thinking about the extreme cases : in the high temperature case , @xmath155 , the gibbs measure is essentially uniform , that is , the system could statistically be in almost any state . on the other hand , near zero temperature , @xmath156",
    ", the gibbs measure is nearly vanishing for any state but the lowest - energy one , and thus the system has a strong preference for the ground state(s ) . the statistical ensemble associated to the gibbs measure",
    "is called the _ canonical ensemble _ , and",
    "the states that the system is likely to be in , according to the gibbs measure , are called _ canonical macrostates _ , so called because those are the states that are observed macroscopically .",
    "there are variations on the standard gibbs measure and its canonical ensemble .",
    "for instance , the _ microcanonical ensemble _ arises from conditioning the gibbs measure on the energy @xmath128 being a constant @xmath157 ( really being within @xmath68 of @xmath157 and sending @xmath68 to zero appropriately ) .",
    "a natural question to ask is whether the microcanonical ensemble is equivalent to the canonical ensemble , meaning that they share the same macrostates .",
    "the answer is yes and no : if certain conditions are satisfied , they are equivalent , and if not , the microcanonical ensemble has a richer set of macrostates .",
    "another ensemble is the _ petit canonical _ ensemble , which results from conditioning on mass : this is also called a _ mixed ensemble _ because it is canonical in energy and microcanonical in mass .",
    "an advantage of gibbs measures is that they ignore transient states and focus instead on the long - time probabilistic behavior of the system , and this approach was initiated in the work of lebowitz , rose , and speer @xcite for the 1d focusing nls on the circle @xmath158 : @xmath159 the canonical ensemble is nt the right thing to look at because it is not normalizable , so they conjectured that , with a mass cutoff , one can construct a formal invariant measure from the hamiltonian energy : @xmath160 the reason for the mass cutoff is that if one forms the gibbs measure with density @xmath161 , then it is not normalizable because @xmath154 is infinite .",
    "this can be fixed by making @xmath162 the allowed mass : the partition function @xmath163 is then a ( finite ) function of both the thermodynamic @xmath150 and the allowed mass @xmath162 .",
    "thus we form the following formal invariant measure : @xmath164 here the product needs to be interpreted properly , highlighting one of the difficulties in constructing gibbs measures for infinite - dimensional systems : a finite - dimensional approximation must be done , for instance , by spectral truncation or by spatial discretization .",
    "bourgain continued the investigation by using spectral truncation to avoid the harmonic analysis on cyclic groups that would have been necessary for spatial discretization @xcite .",
    "he introduced a discretization in fourier space by truncating the fourier sum at the @xmath165-th fourier coefficient : @xmath166 then the finite - dimensional hamiltonian system is : @xmath167 with the hamiltonian energy functional : @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the @xmath14-th fourier coefficient : @xmath170 the hamiltonian is conserved , as is the truncated mass : @xmath171 next consider a ball in this finite - dimensional phase space : @xmath172 and the natural gibbs measure on @xmath173 at fixed inverse temperature @xmath174 is then : @xmath175 where @xmath176 and the normalization constant , @xmath177 we note that this is a petit , or mixed , canonical ensemble : canonical in @xmath128 and microcanonical in the mass , i.e. , the @xmath178 norm is constrained to be no more than a constant @xmath162 .",
    "the limit of @xmath179 as @xmath180 is @xmath181 , which turns out to be the image measure of the random fourier series map : @xmath182 the @xmath183 are independent identically distributed complex gaussian variables , and the image is almost surely in @xmath184 for any @xmath185 . and the limit of @xmath186 as @xmath180 is @xmath187 , the following weighted wiener measure : @xmath188 here @xmath189 can be represented either through the random fourier series leaving off the zero mode , or the formal weiner measure ( with its own normalization @xmath190 ) : @xmath191    then the invariance of the measures @xmath186 under the finite - dimensional flow @xmath192 of the spectrally truncated nls , combined with the uniform regularity of @xmath192 in @xmath193 and the approximation of the nls flow by @xmath192 , all give the following theorem for the limit measure :    the measure @xmath187 in is invariant under the dynamics of the periodic 1d focusing cubic ( @xmath143 ) and quintic ( @xmath194 ) nls .",
    "this is also parlayed into a global well - posedness result for the continuous nls :    the cauchy problem for the 1d periodic nls with @xmath195 and with random initial data : @xmath196 is globally well - posed for almost all @xmath197 and @xmath198 satisfying the mass constraint : @xmath199    another advantage of gibbs measures has been illustrated in recent work on the 1d cubic nls with low - regularity initial data on the circle @xmath158 , namely that in spite of the ill - posedness results for the nls with initial data of lower regularity than @xmath178 @xcite , the bad initial data are quite rare , forming a set of vanishing measure with respect to the natural gibbs measure .",
    "in fact , for the cubic nls on the circle , colliander and oh were able to prove almost - sure local well - posedness for initial data in @xmath200 , for every @xmath201 , and global well - posedness for data in @xmath202 , for @xmath203 @xcite .",
    "oh and sulem proved weak continuity of the cubic nls solution map from @xmath204 to the space of distributions @xcite . both papers relied on a wick ordering of the nonlinearity , which seems to be an appropriate approach for the 1d cubic nls with rough initial data ; by contrast molinet proved that the standard solution map ( without wick ordering ) from @xmath204 to the space of distributions is not weakly continuous .",
    "this approach has also been fruitful for almost sure global well - posedness for the periodic derivative nls @xcite .",
    "jordan , josserand , and turkington have established the connection between gibbs measures and solitons for the 1d nls with non - traditional ( i.e. , not polynomial ) nonlinearities @xcite . consider the following nls on a finite interval @xmath205 $ ] with periodic boundary conditions : @xmath206 with focusing and bounded nonlinearity , i.e. , @xmath207 and @xmath208 , and as @xmath209 ; for example a nonlinearity that approximates behavior of large wave amplitudes : @xmath210 as usual the two conserved quantities are energy : @xmath211 where @xmath212 is the primitive of @xmath35 : @xmath213 , and mass : @xmath214    in this 1d setting , the energy appearing in the gibbs measure contains the kinetic term which captures the fine - grained fluctuations and the potential term which essentially ignores those fluctuations .    using the same kind of spectral truncation as bourgain , the mixed ensemble measure is formed with a regularization with respect to mass as well as the usual conditioning on constrained mass : @xmath215 ) }   \\mathbf{1}_{\\{\\lvert u ^n\\rvert^2_2 { \\leqslant}b \\ } } \\prod du^n.\\ ] ] they fix the mass @xmath162 and scale the inverse temperature as @xmath216 for large @xmath165 so that the mean energy has a finite limit , then rigorously analyze the limit using large deviations theory , comparing the result with numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the large deviations principle is that for appropriate sets @xmath217 : @xmath218 where @xmath219 is the large deviations rate function defined for @xmath220 : @xmath221 here @xmath157 is the coherent energy function @xmath222    what this means is that with high probability the random fields ( spectrally truncated wavefunctions ) @xmath223 converge exactly to the ground state solitons of the continuous nls .",
    "this is because the minimizers of the large deviations rate function are the states that are most probable macroscopically , and all other states have exponentially vanishing probability . and since the large deviations rate function is equal to the hamiltonian energy up to a constant , the ground state solitons that solve the traditional variational problem are identical with the most probable macroscopic states .",
    "the ground states also turn out to be stable both macroscopically and microscopically : the large deviations principle says that the macrostate stays close to the ground states with high probability , even if some of the energy goes into turbulent fluctuations ; and the typical microstate as sampled from the gibbs measure @xmath224 is close to a ground state in the @xmath225-norm .",
    "two key things that jordan , josserand , and turkington need in order for their approach to work are non - integrability and the absence of wave collapse , so in particular , it does nt work for the cubic nls in one , two , or three dimensions .",
    "it turns out that the 1d and 3d cases can be handled in the right frameworks , and possibly two dimensions as well .",
    "numerical simulations led lebowitz , rose , and speer to make a second conjecture about a possible phase transition in the invariant measures for the 1d nls : at high temperature and low mass they saw uniformly small wavefunctions , but at low temperature and high mass there emerged sharply concentrated structures like solitons .    by contrast , simulations in @xcite suggested that there is no phase transition , and then rider , following on the works of mckean and vaninsky @xcite , confirmed this for the 1d infinite - volume focusing nls by proving that the thermodynamic limit is trivial @xcite .",
    "bourgain also studied invariant measures of the 1d infinite - volume defocusing nls @xcite and of the 2d defocusing nls @xcite ( see also the review article @xcite ) , as did tzvetkov @xcite .",
    "these statistical mechanics methods that work so well for the subcritical nls break down at criticality .",
    "for instance , brydges and slade studied the 2d focusing nls @xcite and saw that the natural gibbs measure construction can not produce an invariant measure for large coupling coefficients of the ( critical ) nonlinearity . similarly for 3d focusing nls , the natural construction is not normalizable , and it is thought to be impossible to make any reasonable gibbs construction .",
    "this is the motivation for the alternative approach explained below , using a spatial discretization to construct the finite - dimensional approximation corresponding to the focusing cubic nls in three dimensions .",
    "there are still unresolved issues about what information can be transferred to the continuum limit , but this approach has turned out to be very fruitful , especially as far as how much can be said about properties of the gibbs measures  as it turns out , a lot more than the previous spectral approaches , and even about a phase transition to solitons .",
    "because constructing gibbs measures for the 3d nls appears to be impossible , we consider instead the nls on a spatial discretization of the 3d unit torus @xmath226 ^ 3 $ ] , represented by : @xmath227 so that each vertex of @xmath17 has degree @xmath228 , @xmath17 has @xmath229 sites , and the inter - site distance is @xmath230 .",

    "one consequence of this theorem is confirmation of the conjecture of flach , kladko , and mackay , because the energies of the localized states are bounded away from zero , made clear in figure [ fig4 ] where energy is plotted as a function of @xmath150 .",
    "another straightforward consequence of this theorem is that typical discrete wavefunctions above the critical threshold blow up in the discrete @xmath225 norm : @xmath307 it also turns out that the discrete @xmath225 norm also diverges even for @xmath308 , just with different rates :    [ blowup ] suppose the context of theorem [ phase ] holds , in dimension @xmath293 , with @xmath266 .",

    "the question is whether the mode jumps around or stays in one place ( in which case we have a standing or stationary wave , also called a discrete breather ) .",
    "the following theorem uses the statistical equilibrium result to deduce a dynamical result : the same site continues to be the localized mode for an exponentially long period of time .",

    "this dynamical stability result combines pde and probabilistic methods .",
    "first , with high probability the wavefunction is condensed at time @xmath322 , and then the invariance of the gibbs measure implies that the wavefunction is condensed for an overwhelming proportion of times up to the exponential time in the theorem . if the soliton were to jump from one site to another , then it would have to happen in a tiny window of time ; but that would result in a wavefunction that violates basic nls estimates , so in fact the soliton must stay put .",
    "in other words , it is not only possible , but typical , for solutions of to have unique stable localized modes for exponentially long times if the initial inverse temperature or mass are above a threshold .",
    "earlier results for localized modes were only for existence , and only for large mass , i.e. ,  tending to infinity ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , while theorem [ expo ] proves typicality for finite mass .",
    "our final result is about the probability distribution of the individual coordinates of a random map @xmath244 picked from the measure @xmath323",

    "the symmetry assumption on @xmath212 is that @xmath212 is _ translatable _ by some group  @xmath325 : where @xmath325 is a group of automorphisms of @xmath212 such that : 1 ) @xmath326 , and 2 ) no element of @xmath325 except the identity has any fixed point .",
