    "recently , the relation among complex networks , their geometry and evolution @xcite , and more traditional fields of physics such as quantum physics and quantum communication @xcite , quantum information @xcite , cosmology @xcite and quantum gravity @xcite are starting to attract the interest of scientists .",
    "for instance , an interesting aspect of complex network evolution is that in major examples of realistic models for complex networks growth , quantum statistics emerge as important distributions determining the network dynamics .",
    "in fact , the evolution of scale - free networks with fitness of the nodes @xcite is described by the bose - einstein statistics and this model can be therefore mapped to a bose gas . in correspondence of the bose - einstein condensation @xcite of the bose gas",
    ", the network topology undergoes a major structural condensation transition in which a node is linked to a finite fraction of links .",
    "this model can explain the emergence of  super - hubs \" in complex networks and the  winner - takes - all \" phenomenon .",
    "interestingly the evolution of cayley trees with fitness of the nodes , is determined by the fermi - dirac statistics @xcite .",
    "in addition to that , it has also been found that ensembles of complex networks have been shown to be related with quantum statistics @xcite .",
    "finally , it has been shown that random geometric networks on a hyperbolic space can show a scale - free network topology @xcite and that growing networks in hyperbolic space define the so called  network cosmology \" @xcite . from the quantum information perspective , complex networks encode relevant information in their structures , and new quantum entropy measures have been proposed in order to characterize and quantify this information @xcite.moreover , the quantum random walk can be used to propose different definitions of quantum pagerank on networks @xcite .",
    "multiplex networks are multilayer network structures that are attracting large interest @xcite .",
    "in fact they are able to describe several types of interactions between the same set of nodes .",
    "for example , social networks , where the same people are connected by different means of communications , or different types of social ties , like friendship , collaboration , co - authorship , and so on are better described by multiplex networks .",
    "similarly , if we want to describe diffusion in transportation networks we need to consider the multiplex nature of the underlying transportation networks , where a given location can be linked to other locations by different types of transportation , train , bus , airplane etc . finally , in brain networks the large variety of neuron types and types of interactions between them , will not be fully understood if the multilayer approach is not adopted @xcite .",
    "multilayer have a highly non trivial structure including communities @xcite and many different types of encoded structural correlations @xcite .",
    "recently some quantum information measures such as the von neumann entropy of single networks @xcite have been extended to multilayer networks in order to quantify their complexity @xcite .",
    "multiplex networks are formed by layers that are usually scale - free and have a number of nodes that increases in time .",
    "for these reasons their evolution can be described by growing multiplex networks models @xcite . in single layer networks",
    "growing network models @xcite are able to explain the spontaneous emergence of scale - free degree distribution .",
    "in particular the most fundamental growing network model , the barabsi - albert ( ba ) model @xcite includes only two dynamical rules : growth and preferential attachment , meaning that at each time a new node is added to the network and it attaches links preferentially to high degree nodes .",
    "just these two elements of the model have been shown to be responsible for a scale - free degree distribution of exponent @xmath0 .",
    "an important element determining network evolution is the intrinsic quality of the nodes , determining their fitness that make them more likely to acquire new links , with respect to other nodes with the same degree @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of single growing scale - free networks with fitness of the nodes can be mapped to a bose gas @xcite giving rise to the intriguing phenomenon of the bose - einstein condensation , while growing cayley trees with fitness of the nodes can be mapped to a fermi gas@xcite by using a similar mathematical formalism .    in the context of multiplex networks , growing multiplex networks models",
    "have been shown to generate multiplex networks with different degree distributions in the different layers , and different pattern of correlations @xcite between the degrees of the same node in different layers @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the role of the fitness of the nodes on growing multiplex networks models has not yet been explored . here",
    "we combine the process of link addition and the process of rewiring of the links in presence of an intrinsic fitness of the nodes .",
    "we show that the network growth can exploit the symmetries of the multiplex networks and we can generate scale - free supersymmetric multiplex networks described by coupled fermi - dirac and bose - einstein statistics .",
    "moreover , we explore the information content of these structures with quantum information tools by extending the definition of entanglement entropy of single networks @xcite to multiplex structures .",
    "to this end we map each each network in a given layer to a quantum network state and we describe the complexity of each layer of the multiplex networks by calculating the entanglement entropies of these quantum states .",
    "finally we relate the entanglement entropies of the layers of the supersymmetric multiplex network to the entropy rate of the multiplex network .",
    "the entropy rate @xcite of the supersymmetric multiplex model describes the rate at which the typical number of multiplex networks , which can be realized during the dynamics , grows in time .",
    "therefore here we show that the entanglement entropies of the layers of the supersymmetric network , which extract information form a snapshot of the multiplex network using quantum information tools , have a very simple relation with the entropy rate of the same supersymmetric multiplex network , describing the classical non - equilibrium dynamics of the multilayer structure .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section ii we define the supersymmetric multiplex model and we provide its mean - field solution . in section",
    "iii we characterize the supersymmetric multiplex structural properties . in section iv we define the entropy rate of the supersymmetric multiplex network . in section",
    "v evaluate the entanglement entropies of the layers of the supersymmetric multiplex network .",
    "in section vi we relate the entanglement entropies of the layers of the supersymmetric multiplex network with its entropy rate .",
    "finally in section vii we give the conclusions .",
    "we note here that for simplicity in the main text of the paper we consider only the case of a duplex ( i.e. a multiplex with @xmath1 ) , but the analysis can be easily extended to a multiplex with a generic value of the number of layers @xmath2 .",
    "therefore in the appendix the extension to supersymmetric multiplex networks with generic value of @xmath2 is discussed .",
    "a multiplex network is a multilayer system formed by @xmath3 nodes having a copy ( or replica ) in each of the @xmath2 layers , and @xmath2 layers formed by different networks of interactions between the @xmath3 nodes .",
    "here we assume that each node @xmath4 has quenched quality quantified by the quenched parameter @xmath5 called the energy of the node and we indicate by _",
    "i = e^-_i the fitness of the node @xmath4 , determined both by its energy and a global parameter @xmath6 . on single layers",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the fitness of the nodes is able to explain how some nodes ( the more fit ) acquire links at a faster rate than others , as observed in a variety of complex networks , including the internet and the world - wide - web . in particular , in these models it is assumed that each new node links preferentially to nodes of high degree and high fitness , with a probability @xmath7 that it attaches a new link to a node @xmath4 given by _",
    "i== , where @xmath8 is the degree of node @xmath4 , in this way generalizing the dynamics of the famous ba model @xcite in which the preferential attachment is only driven by the degree of the nodes .",
    "when considering the evolution of technological , social or transportation multilayer networks , a similar mechanism can be taken into account .",
    "nevertheless t , he new links of a given layer might be added also according to a preferential attachment mechanism deriving from the popularity of a node in another layer .",
    "this model the case in which a popular node in one layer attracts also links in another layer .",
    "moreover , it can also happen that , instead , the popularity of a node in a layer is modulated by a process of rewiring of the links , and that links attached to popular nodes in one layer are more likely to be rewired .",
    "this could mimic the case in which the connectivities of hubs are damped by the process of link rewiring .",
    "we consider for simplicity a multiplex networks formed by @xmath1 layers and we describe its evolution as a growing multiplex network model in which each node has a given energy and corresponding fitness .",
    "specifically , we consider the case in which in the dynamics in the two networks is not symmetrical . in one layer",
    "new links are exclusively added according to a generalized preferential attachment which rewards high fitness nodes of high degree in either one of the layers , and in the other layer the links are attached but also rewired in such a way to reduce the growth of the degree of high fitness nodes in that layer .",
    "this model can be generalized to a multiplex networks with larger number of layers in which the layer can be divided in two groups , each group of layer behaving in a similar way . in order to keep the description of the model simple we now focus on the case in which @xmath1 , discussing in the appendix the generalization to the general value of @xmath2 .",
    "we start at @xmath9 from a small set of nodes @xmath10 connected in both layers .",
    "each node @xmath4 of the network has degrees @xmath11}_i , k^{[2]}_i$ ] respectively in layer 1 and layer 2 , and energy @xmath12 drawn from a @xmath13 distribution . at each time",
    "@xmath14 we add a node to the multiplex network , each node has two replicas nodes , one on each layer .",
    "moreover , each replica node is initially attached to @xmath15 existing nodes in the same layer . in the following",
    "we will indicate with @xmath16 the number of network changes , i.e. links additions or link rewirings , occurring in each layer starting from time @xmath17 .",
    "after time @xmath14 we will have @xmath18 .",
    "for each network change in layer 1 we follow the subsequent procedure :    * we extract a number @xmath19}_l=1,2 $ ] .",
    "the event @xmath19}_l=1 $ ] occurs with probability @xmath20}(1)=\\alpha$ ] while the event @xmath21}=2 $ ] occurs with probability @xmath20}(2)=1-\\alpha$ ] . *",
    "if @xmath19}_l=1 $ ] the new node is attached in layer 1 to a node @xmath22}_l$ ] chosen with probability ^[1,1](i_l^[1]=i)= , i.e. it will be attached preferentially to nodes with low energy and high degree in layer 1 , according to a generalized preferential attachment . instead ,",
    "if @xmath19}_l=2 $ ] the new node is attached in layer 1 to a node @xmath22}_l$ ] chosen with probability ^[1,2](i_l^[1]=i)= , i.e. will be attached preferentially to nodes with low energy and high degree in layer 2 , according to a generalized preferential attachment .    for each network change in layer 2",
    "we follow the subsequent procedure :    * we extract a number @xmath23}_l=1,2 $ ] .",
    "the event @xmath23}_l=1 $ ] occurs with probability @xmath24}(1)=1-\\alpha$ ] while the event @xmath25}=2 $ ] occurs with probability @xmath24}(2)=\\alpha$ ] .",
    "* if @xmath23}_l=1 $ ] the new node will be attached , in layer 2 , to a node @xmath26}$ ] chosen with probability ^[2,1](i_l^[2]=i)=. instead , if @xmath23}_l=2 $ ] a random link of a node @xmath27}_l$ ] chosen with probability ^[2,2](i_l^[2]=i)= is rewired , i.e. it is detached from node @xmath26}$ ] and attached to the new node of the network .",
    "therefore the network is determined by the sequence of the values @xmath28}_l , i_l^{[1]}\\sigma^{[2]}_l , i_l^{[2]}\\}$ ] that fully determines the evolution of the multiplex network given the initial condition .      when studying growing networks with preferential attachment , in general large attention is given to the degree sequence of the network . in order to predict the degree distribution of these models , mean - field approaches have been extensively studied , finding that in general they give a very good prediction of the structural properties of the network @xcite . in this paper",
    "we analyse the supersymmetric multiplex model with the mean - field theory leaving to subsequent works the analysis with the master equation approach . in order to check the validity of the approach",
    "we then compare the analytical results to simulations as discussed in section [ sim ] . in the mean - field approach",
    ", one assumes that the degree of each node has no fluctuations , and therefore identifies the degrees @xmath11}_i , k^{[2]}_i$ ] at time @xmath14 with their average over the multiplex network realization .",
    "moreover this approximation is also called the continuous approximation because it is assumed that both the degrees of the nodes and the time are continuous variables .",
    "therefore the mean - field equations for the supersymmetric multiplex model read = me^-_i , + = me^-_i .",
