    "one of the prerequisites for producing quantum interferences is the ability to generate states energy that compulsorily cross or come close at least twice in the course of variation of a control parameter such that a quantum system following the corresponding paths splits into two separated waves at first crossing ( splitter ) and recombining into a single wave in the next crossing ( mixer)@xcite . this in general induces accumulation of dynamical phases and superposition of wave functions leading thus to the formation of fringes that are inspected and probed in spectroscopic analyzes to capture some information relevant to the complex dynamics of a system bathing in its environment@xcite .",
    "however , two crossings ( double passage ) might not be enough to produce desired information ( an exceptional case of quantum interferences with a double - crossing configuration is discussed in ref . ) , instead , some of the control parameters of the system are more often periodically changed such that the system oscillates back and forth around an avoided level crossing@xcite .",
    "this procedure has already been applied to two - level systems ( tlss ) with great predictions@xcite . for these reasons and due to versatile applications in quantum technology , cryptography and metrology@xcite , huge and remarkable alike attentions , emerging both from theoretical and experimental viewpoints",
    "are currently granted to qubit , the unit of quantum information processing ( qip)@xcite .",
    "the former ( qubit ) is unquestionably ubiquitous in nature and gently imposes as a promising candidate for the breakthrough in developing quantum technologies . for the successful realization of the future quantum computer ,",
    "superconducting qubits comprising charge and flux qubits are implemented in various solid - state real or artificial devices , ranging from josephson junctions@xcite to quantum dot based devices@xcite .",
    "features of qubit are inferred for instance by reading out its response to external perturbations or by periodically varying some of its control parameters ( see ref . for review ) .",
    "the last technique led to the uncovering of interference patterns associated with landau - zener - stckelberg - majorana ( lzsm ) oscillations@xcite in population of levels allowing to decipher and explore complex dissipative effects on the qubit and to measure some relevant parameters such as coherence time and inhomogeneous decay time@xcite .",
    "an experimental method based on steady - state allowing to collect all relevant information about a qubit is found in ref ..    in qip , the storage of information is based on quantum logic gates that are mostly made of qubits , but can also be composed of qutrits@xcite .",
    "the qutrit is the unit of information in ternary quantum computing made of the superposition of three states@xcite .",
    "it is the quantum analogous of the classical trit . within the vast and incommensurable literature devoted to the qip",
    ", few analytic studies address the questions of qutrits coherently controlled by an electromagnetic field or periodically driven@xcite .",
    "this is most likely due to the complexity of handling thls dynamics theoretically and/or the difficulty of reading them out experimentally .",
    "indeed , current attempts / proposals in this regard tend to simplify the complex dynamics of the thls to that of a tls which is easier to handle@xcite .",
    "for instance , by applying an additional static magnetic field , the degeneracy is lifted between states .    as compared to qubit ,",
    "the qutrit is more robust against environmental effects , encodes more information , has a longer coherence time , can already be implemented at room temperature@xcite and provides better security in qip@xcite . for these reasons",
    ", the qutrit plays a crucial role in qip . to process information carried",
    ", qutrits should preserve their coherent states for a longer time than is necessary to lose the information encoded , and ideally they must be completely isolated from unwanted external influences .",
    "qutrits unfortunately are found in host exotic and quantum devices ( three - well potentials@xcite , quantum electrodynamics circuits@xcite , optical lattice@xcite , nitrogen vacancy centers@xcite ( nvc ) , superconducting quantum circuits@xcite etc ) where nuclear - spin interactions and molecular dynamics prevail and may have drastic incidence on their coherence . due to",
    "the difficulty of isolating a qutrit from its environment , along with the inability to realize practical quantum systems that operate with a large number of qutrits , currently realizable quantum computers can only be of small number of qubits / qutrits@xcite .",
    "these observations raise the key question of qutrit coherent dynamic control which can be achieved by switching the detuning between finite values and zero at speeds ranging from the regime of non - adiabatic ( fast sweep ) to that of adiabatic evolutions ( slow sweep ) or by applying a longitudinal and/or a transverse electromagnetic field .    in this paper , we study the dynamics of a thls periodically driven in both longitudinal and transverse directions and in the presence of an easy - axis anisotropy @xmath0 .",
    "we investigate the possibility of performing a coherent control of thlss by simultaneously applying two classical fields with respect to a quantization axis .",
    "nuclear - spin exchanges causing hyperfine interactions as in quantum dots based devices are , however , neglected . due to the difficulty of analytically solving the relevant schrdinger equation in an exact basis@xcite , ( the latter is exactly solved numerically ) two main approximations",
    "are made : the transverse and longitudinal drive approximations . in both cases , we consider the two complementary limits of weak and strong drives obtained by comparing the amplitude ( in frequency units since @xmath4 ) of the driving fields with the characteristic frequency of the longitudinal field .",
    "we open a deeper perspective of using spectroscopic analysis to probe thlss dynamics by periodic drives and the possibility of discussing the intrinsic dynamics of three - level spin-@xmath5 systems without necessarily reducing their dynamics to that of an approximate tls .",
    "we believe that this opens a new route to realizing optimal control of thlss for future implementation in quantum computers .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec.[model ] , the model of the study is presented and its applications are discussed . in secs.[sec1 ] and [ sec2 ] , the transverse and longitudinal driving approximations are discussed . in sec.[sec3 ] , more approximations also useful for experimental applications are implemented . a possible application of our results to qip",
    "is discussed in sec.[sec4 ] .",
    "the paper concludes in sec.[sec5 ] with a summary of our main achievements .",
    "we consider a thls coherently driven in both longitudinal and transverse directions with time - dependent periodic classical fields ( one can see ref . for a similar discussion on qubits ) . in the longitudinal direction ,",
    "the field is of amplitude @xmath6 and frequency @xmath7 ( a zero - phase field at initial time ) .",
    "it is also detuned in that direction by an easy - axis anisotropy @xmath0 ( static part of the detuning ) . in the transverse direction ,",
    "one applies another periodic field now of amplitude @xmath8 and frequency @xmath9 . throughout the paper , the reduced planck s constant @xmath4 ; therefore , the amplitudes of the fields are of the dimension of frequency and comparable with @xmath7 and/or @xmath10 . this fact will be shortly exploited .",
    "the setup is described by the prototype hamiltonian @xmath11 where the first term @xmath12 is the hamiltonian of the longitudinal frequency - modulated thls and the second term @xmath13 stands for the longitudinal field - induced hamiltonian which pours into the system , the energy necessary to excite its states .",
    "the last term describes a zero - field energy splitting between the middle state and its neighbors .",
    "@xmath14 with @xmath15 are spin operators or , more specifically , the generators of the @xmath16 group associated with the lie algebra @xmath17 here given by the commutation relations @xmath18=i\\epsilon_{\\gamma}^{\\mu\\nu}s^{\\gamma}$ ] where @xmath19 are structure constants on @xmath16 and @xmath20=ab - ba$ ] ( see ref . ) . though @xmath21 is expressed in terms of generators of the lie group @xmath16 , it embeds the hidden dynamical symmetry of the lie group @xmath3 .",
    "we observe that the @xmath16 symmetry is broken down by adding the term @xmath1 which renders @xmath21 nonlinear in @xmath16 . as shown in ref .",
    ", this seemingly non - linearity is removed in the lie group @xmath3 where in turn , @xmath21 becomes a trajectory and expresses as a linear combination of gell - mann matrices@xcite ( generators of the @xmath22 algebra@xcite ) .    ) .",
    "the left panel is a full cycle of the @xmath3 lzsm interferometry and the right panel indicates periodic trajectories .",
    "dashed lines are energies of diabatic states while solid lines are adiabatic energies of the hamiltonian when the frequency of the transverse drive is set to zero ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "inserted is a full cycle of the @xmath3 lzsm interferometry for non - zero and large @xmath10 .",
    "it appears from insert that adiabatic trajectories oscillate , and this , rapidly . as @xmath10 increases",
    ", adiabatic states can interfere / touch at avoided crossings such that information can be directly transferred from one adiabatic state to another .",
    "this is a clear indication that in the regime of strong transverse drives , corresponding to adiabatic - like drive , one may expect quantum interferences as @xmath10 increases .",
    "in addition to the @xmath16 lzsm model , this is yet another situation in which adiabatic principle of quantum mechanics breaks down resulting in transitions between adiabatic states .",
    "the time @xmath24 is in the unit of @xmath25.,width=340,height=151 ]    as a starting point of our description , let us introduce an appropriate basis for spin operators .",
    "we assume for a while that the transverse drive is completely switched off ( @xmath26 ) . thereof ,",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath21 are eigenstates of @xmath27 .",
    "they match the @xmath28 projections @xmath29 of the total spin vector along the quantization direction in the absence of anisotropy ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "they are called diabatic states and denoted as @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively for the lower , middle and upper levels .",
    "spin operators are written in that basis as @xmath34 and @xmath35 and the hamiltonian acquires the form@xcite @xmath36.\\quad\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] diabatic eigen - energies @xmath37 are plotted in the figure [ figure0 ] ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the system undergoes sudden transitions at times @xmath38d / a)/\\omega+2\\pi n/\\omega$ ] ( where @xmath39 ) where two diabatic energies @xmath40 and @xmath41 cross .",
    "the corresponding curves indicate non - adiabatic trajectories followed by the thls during the fast drive .    for @xmath42 , the hamiltonian @xmath21 describes a full cycle of the @xmath3 lzsm interferometry@xcite ( see the corresponding energy diagram displayed in figure [ figure0](a ) ) .",
    "three crossing regions can be identified : one at time @xmath43 , another at @xmath44 , and the last one at @xmath45 .",
    "this shows that if the thls is prepared for instance in the state @xmath46 at an initial time far from the left of @xmath47 , it splits twice : once at @xmath47 ( first splitter ) and another at @xmath48 ( second splitter ) , and recombines at @xmath49 ( mixer ) before arriving any of the other states at time @xmath50 far from the right of @xmath49 .",
    "these interactions between quantum paths lead to lzsm interference patterns@xcite ( a prototype is presented in fig.[figure2bis ] ) that can be destructive or constructive ( see ref .",
    "for ample discussion ) . such a splitting and recombination of populations",
    "can also be observed with other preparations of the thls .    for @xmath51",
    ", the model describes a sequence of @xmath3 lzsm interferometers .",
    "therefore , by periodically changing one of the control parameters ( detuning and/or rabi coupling ) of a single @xmath3 lzsm interferometry , the resulting system behaves as a combination of multiple such interferometers ( see fig.[figure0](b ) ) .",
    "the double @xmath3 lzsm interferometry realizable by restricting periodic passages through two cycles or by only coupling two interferometers , is predicted in ref . using a triple quantum dot chain configuration ( coupled lzsm quantum dot interferometers ) .",
    "considering interplay between quantum paths , we note that direct transitions between the states with extremal spin projections are forbidden .",
    "the resonant transverse field in @xmath52 only ensures the pair of transitions @xmath53 and @xmath54 while direct transitions @xmath55 are not possible .",
    "transitions are mediated by tunneling between neighboring states .",
    "the system passes through the intermediate state @xmath32 .",
    "furthering the description of the features of our model , we must realize that when the @xmath3 symmetry breaks down by suppressing the easy - axis anisotropy ( @xmath30 ) , all diabatic states cross at a single point in one cycle . there is a unitary operation @xmath56 which transforms @xmath57 and @xmath58 subsequently inter - changing the actions of the fields such that @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "then for instance , if the dynamics of the system driven by the transverse field is known when the longitudinal field is turned off , the inverse situation ( dynamics with longitudinal drive in the absence of the transverse drive ) is easily probed as deductible from the formal case by reverse engineering with @xmath62 .",
    "this is a consequence of the choice we have made to ascribe the same shape of the signal ( cosine shape ) to the longitudinal and transverse drives .",
    "from now onwards , we consider and discuss four limiting cases adopted by comparing the characteristic frequency @xmath7 of the longitudinal drive with @xmath6 and @xmath8 that are of frequency dimension as @xmath4 .",
    "firstly , we compare @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( transverse drive approximations ) and distinguish between the limits of weak ( @xmath63 ) and strong ( @xmath64 ) transverse drives . in the second case @xmath64 , diabatic states ( eigenstates of @xmath27 )",
    "hybridize at level crossings rather forming avoided level crossings ( solid lines on figure [ figure0 ] ) .",
    "the eigenstates of the hamiltonian in this situation are called adiabatic states and define the trajectories followed by the system during slow changes - in - time of the hamiltonian .",
    "secondly , we proceed similarly by comparing @xmath7 and @xmath6 ( longitudinal drive approximations ) .",
    "we equally distinguish between the limits of weak ( @xmath65 ) and strong ( @xmath66 ) longitudinal drives .",
    "such limiting cases may be relevant for future applications in bose einstein condensate@xcite , quantum computing@xcite , symmetric double - well potential@xcite , nvc@xcite , atoms in optical lattices@xcite etc .",
    "we are typically interested in the time - evolution of populations in diabatic levels during variations of external fields ( longitudinal and transverse drives ) .",
    "however , such populations strongly depend on how the fields are tuned .",
    "we mainly focus on two complementary regimes of the transverse field : the weak transverse limit , treated in the diabatic basis as described in detail below , and the extreme limit of the strong transverse drive elucidated in the adiabatic basis .",
    "this limit is addressed in the basis of the eigenstates of @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath67 be the total wave - function of the thls spanned in the three - dimensional hilbert space @xmath68 by the basis vectors @xmath69^t$ ] , @xmath70^t$ ] and @xmath71^t$ ] ( where @xmath72 indicates hereafter the vector transposed ) that are mutually orthogonal @xmath73 and satisfy the closure relation @xmath74 , ( @xmath75 )",

    "the coefficients of the expansion , are projections of @xmath79 onto the direction of the basis vector @xmath80 and are subjected to the constraint @xmath81 ( conservation law ) . from a quantum mechanical view point , @xmath82 are probability amplitudes for measuring / observing the thls in the state @xmath80 .",
    "quantum mechanics then tells us that populations we are looking for are @xmath83 when @xmath79 obeys the first order linear differential equation @xmath84 known as the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) .",
    "this equation is subjected to the initial condition @xmath85 .",
    "the wave - function @xmath67 shares the same symmetry operations as @xmath21 .",
    "indeed , topologically , the group @xmath86 generated from the algebra by exponentiation is a compact manifold@xcite .",
    "the lie algebra @xmath22 can be considered as a three - dimensional vector space spanned by the gell - mann matrices in which the hamiltonian is a trajectory . by conjecture ,",
    "the wave - function arises via exponentiation of the hamiltonian .",
    "then , because of the stated topology , the wave - function is a trajectory in the lie group @xmath3 while the hamiltonian is a trajectory in the lie algebra @xmath22 .",
    "these observations reveal that there are some locally hidden dynamical symmetries between probability amplitudes that follow from symmetries of the hamiltonian .",
    "this idea is widely shared in this work and such hidden symmetries are elucidated and exploited to reduce the length of our calculations .    in the basis @xmath87 , @xmath46 , @xmath88 ,",

    "it is calculated by numerically solving the tdse ( [ equ5 ] ) with the model ( [ equ1 ] ) . for numerical implementation",
    ", we have considered @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",

    "the point of primary interest is then to remove all time - dependence from the longitudinal drive .",
    "we rotate the system from the schrdinger to dirac / interaction picture with the help of the gauge transformation @xmath103 . here ,",
    "@xmath104 ( population preserving ) is a unitary operator @xmath105 ensuring the rotation ( @xmath106 being the @xmath107 unit matrix , the symbol @xmath108 indicates the hermitian conjugate ) and @xmath109^{t}$ ] a three - component vector probability amplitude .",

    "let s remark that the time - evolution described by eq.([equ9 ] ) shows a sequence of consecutive lzsm oscillations when the amplitude of the longitudinal driving field widely exceeds the uniaxis anisotropy ( @xmath129 ) and the frequency of the transverse drive is weak enough .",
    "roughly speaking , the signature of lzsm oscillations in the population of levels is well pronounced in the extreme limit @xmath23 and in the weak transverse drive limit ( @xmath63 ) as discussed in this subsection ( figure [ figure3 ] ) . in order to understand such transitions",
