    "_ integrable_. the celebrated newlander - nirenberg theorem @xcite says that an almost complex structure with @xmath15 is equivalent to a complex structure .",
    "hence , for a smooth manifold @xmath1 to admit a complex structure , we need to check if there exist almost complex structures ( this is a topological question ) , and then to find an integrable one ( this is an analytic problem ) .",

    "the complex proyective space @xmath4 has a natural hermitian metric , the fubini - study metric .",

    "so it is natural to ask if the classes of smooth manifolds admitting complex , symplectic and khler structures coincide under some topological constraints .",

    "indeed , the main source of examples of symplectic manifolds is algebraic geometry .",
    "this led to the belief that symplectic and khler conditions coincided in the compact case ( see for instance @xcite ) .",

    "bock constructed non formal symplectic manifolds with arbitrary betti numbers .",
    "the construction of simply connected symplectic non formal ( compact ) manifolds turned out to be a more difficult problem .",
    "in fact , it was conjectured in 1994 ( see @xcite ) that a compact simply connected symplectic ( compact ) manifold should be formal : this is the so - called _ lupton - oprea conjecture _ on the formalising tendency of a symplectic structure .",
    "this conjecture was proven false by babenko and tamanov in 2000 ( see @xcite ) . for every @xmath48 , they constructed an example of a simply connected , symplectic non formal compact manifold of real dimension @xmath5 . on the other hand , by a result of miller @xcite , simply connected compact manifolds of dimension @xmath49 are formal .",
    "hence a remarkable gap in dimension @xmath0 was left .",
    "this gap was filled by m. fernndez and the second author in 2008 ( see @xcite ) .    here",
    "we shall prove that the manifold constructed in @xcite admits a complex structure , thereby giving a new example fitting in the scheme of theorem  [ c_s_n_k ] .",
    "the precise result is :    [ main ] there exists an @xmath0-dimensional , compact , simply connected , symplectic and complex manifold which is non - formal and does not satisfy the lefschetz property .",
    "in particular , it does not admit khler structures .",
