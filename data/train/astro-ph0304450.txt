    "circumstellar disks around young stars are composed of gas and dust particles , and in general , the dust and gas accretion velocities are not equal .",
    "the gas suffers turbulent viscosity and accretes onto the central star on a viscous time - scale of order @xmath3 yr ( hartmann et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the orbital evolution of dust particles , on the other hand , is controlled by gas drag ( adachi , hayashi , & nakazawa 1976 ; weidenschilling 1977 ) .",
    "several factors affect the radial motion of particles .",
    "first , gas drag in the radial direction entrains particles in the accretion flow . when the gas density is high or when the particle size is small , the particles follow the gas motion , and accrete onto the star on the viscous time - scale .",
    "second , angular momentum is transfered between particles and the gas .",
    "the radial gas pressure gradient shifts the angular velocity of the gas slightly from the keplerian value . moreover ,",
    "if starlight can irradiate particles , then radiation pressure causes non - keplerian deviations in the particle velocity as well .",
    "dust particles can thus gain or lose angular momentum through gas drag and thus move outward or inward , depending on whether they experience a net head - wind or a net tail - wind .    in a previous paper ( takeuchi & lin 2002 , hereafter paper i ) , we studied particle motion in optically thick disks , using the assumption that radiation pressure on the dust is negligible .",
    "we found that dust particles smaller than @xmath4 accrete with smaller velocity than the gas .",
    "as the gas accretion proceeds , small dust particles are left behind in the disk and the dust - to - gas ratio gradually increases . because circumstellar disks associated with young stars are generally optically thick , the majority of dust particles are not directly exposed to the stellar radiation , and the approximation used in paper i is applicable .",
    "there are always , however , some particles near the disk surfaces that are directly irradiated , and the motion of such particles are affected by radiation pressure .",
    "klahr & lin ( 2001 ) and takeuchi & artymowicz ( 2001 ) studied the motion of particles in optically thin gas disks around young vega - type stars , where the dust experiences both gas drag and radiation pressure .",
    "because the radiation pressure reduces the angular velocity of the dust below that of the gas , the dust tends to move outward .",
    "thus , in a more refined description of an optically thick disk , one expects that particles in the irradiated surface layer move outward , while beneath the surface layer particles move inward .",
    "if the surface outflow dominates the midplane inflow , then there is a net radial expansion that may induce the formation of rings or gaps .    in this paper",
    ", we study the surface dust outflow in optically thick disks due to radiation pressure .",
    "the mass flux of the surface outflow is calculated , which is compared to that of the inflow inside the disk .",
    "we find that the surface outflow is negligible in a minimum - mass - solar - nebula model , but that the surface outflow can dominate inflow at some disk radii in some cases , including situations involving high stellar luminosity or low gas mass .",
    "in such disks , the appearance of rings or gaps is expected .",
    "we consider circumstellar disks around young pre - main - sequence stars .",
    "the disks are turbulent and are accreting onto the central stars , but they are assumed to be passive , that is , the disks are primarily heated by stellar radiation only .",
    "when turbulent fluctuations are averaged out , the mean gas motion is nearly in hydrostatic equilibrium and the radial accretion flow is much slower than the azimuthal kepler rotation . in cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath5 ) ,",
    "the balance of forces in the @xmath6- and @xmath7-directions are @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the gas angular velocity , @xmath11 is the central star s mass , @xmath12 is the gas density , and @xmath13 is the gas pressure . for simplicity , we assume that the gas disk has power - law density and temperature profiles in the radial direction , and is isothermal in the vertical direction .",
    "the temperature distribution is written as a power - law of index @xmath14 , @xmath15 where the subscript `` 0 '' denotes quantities at 1 au , and a non - dimensional quantity @xmath16 is the radius in au .",

[ [ eq : gaseq_z ] ] )",

    "the surface density of the gas disk is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",
    "the angular velocity @xmath10 of the gas is slightly different from the keplerian angular velocity @xmath23 because of the radial pressure gradient in the gas . from equation ( [ eq : gaseq_r ] )",

    "turbulent disk viscosity has been ascribed to various mechanisms , including the convective instability ( lin & papaloizou 1980 ) and the magneto - rotational instability ( balbus & hawley 1991 ) . in this paper , we simply model the viscous effect of turbulence using the so - called @xmath30 prescription ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , @xmath31 we adopt the following fiducial parameters : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 au , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",

    "the epstein s drag law is applied , because the mean free path of the gas molecules ( 7 cm at 1 au ) is larger than the particle size .",
    "the gas drag force is @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the mean thermal velocity of the gas molecules , and @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the velocities of the dust and the gas , respectively .",
    "the stopping time due to the gas drag is @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the particle mass .",
    "we define the non - dimensional stopping time normalized by the orbital time as , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the keplerian velocity at the midplane . when terminal velocity is achieved , the gas drag balances the @xmath7-component of the stellar gravity , @xmath65 . using the approximation @xmath66 ,",
    "the terminal velocity @xmath56 is @xmath67 the mass flux of particles in the vertical direction is @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the dust mass density .",
    "if the gas disk were laminar , the particles would concentrate at the midplane in a time that is short compared to the evolution time of the gas disk ( the sedimentation time - scale is about @xmath70 yr for @xmath71 particles at 10 au ) .",
    "when the gas disk is turbulent , however , the gas stirs and disperses the particles and prevents sedimentation . the mass flux of dust arising from this turbulent diffusion is assumed proportional to the gradient of the dust concentration @xmath72 in analogy with molecular diffusion ( e.g , monin & yaglom , 1971 , p. 579 ; morfill , 1985 ,  3.5.1 ; cuzzi , dobrovolskis , & champney 1993 ) .",

    "the total dust density is @xmath81    as discussed in paper i , the sedimentation of particles is more effective for larger particles and at larger distances from the star . as increasing the distance , the dust disk becomes relatively thinner compared to the gas disk .",
    "the disks considered in this paper are optically thick at visible wavelengths even in the vertical direction ( @xmath82 at 100 au ) .",
    "stellar light can not penetrate the dust disk . only particles residing in the thin surface layer",
    "are exposed to stellar radiation pressure .",
    "the optical depth from the star to the position @xmath83 in the dust disk is @xmath84 where @xmath85 , @xmath86 is inner edge of the dust disk , and @xmath87 is the dust opacity in the visible wavelength for an unit mass of the gas .",
    "the opacity for a unit mass of the dust is @xmath88 . in our calculations ,",
    "we adopt @xmath89 .",
    "this choice of inner boundary does not affect the integral ( [ eq : optdepth ] ) , because the dust disk is flared and the main contribution to the optical depth comes from the dust at relatively large distances from the star .",
    "we adopt a dust mass opacity @xmath90 for visible wavelengths . for particles smaller than @xmath91 ,",
    "the opacity is independent of ( the maximum ) particle size ( see figs . 5 and 11 in miyake & nakagawa 1993 ) .",
    "thus , we need not consider variations in @xmath87 with changes in the particle size .",
    "figure [ fig : lightsur ] shows the disk surfaces at which the optical depth to the starlight is unity . above these illuminated surfaces , the dust particles are directly exposed to the stellar radiation .",
    "figure [ fig : lightsur]@xmath92 shows the illuminated surfaces of the standard disk models which are composed of single - sized particles ( @xmath93 to @xmath94 ) . as the particle size increases , the level of the illuminated surfaces becomes lower .",
    "this size dependence is because larger particles sediment more readily , and thus concentrate near the midplane .",
    "the illuminated surfaces have a slightly flatter geometry than the gas disk , because the dust particles at larger distances sediment more effectively .",
    "figure [ fig : lightsur]@xmath95 shows the illuminated surfaces of the models containing power - law size distributions .",
    "the illuminated surfaces lie at roughly three disk scale heights , which are similar to those of the single - sized @xmath96 particles .",
    "the location of the illuminated surface does not change significantly with the maximum size of the particles , because high altitude above the midplane is mostly populated by the smallest particles .",
    "dust particles above the illuminated surface suffer radiation pressure from the central star .",
    "the radiation pressure balances a part of the stellar gravity , so that the small particles orbit slower than the gas . because the gas drag transfers angular momentum from the gas to the particles , the particles move outward , leading to an outflow in the surface layers of dust disks . in this section",
    ", we estimate the mass fluxes carried by these outflows .",
    "the radiation pressure is expressed through the ratio @xmath97 to the stellar gravity .",
    "the radial component is @xmath98 the value of @xmath97 , which is calculated with the mie s scattering theory , depends on the particle composition , porosity , shape , and size . in this paper",
    ", we adopt @xmath97 for `` young cometary particles , '' which is calculated by wilck & mann ( 1996 ) for typical interplanetary particles in the solar system and shown in figure [ fig : beta ] . in general ,",
    "stellar light causes poynting - robertson drag on the particles in addition to the gas drag induced by radiation pressure . however , in the gas disks considered here , the gas density is sufficiently large so that gas drag dominates poynting - robertson drag ( see the discussion in takeuchi & artymowicz 2001 ,  4.2 ) .",

    "we also neglect second order terms in @xmath26 and @xmath111 . to this level of approximation , @xmath112 , and",

    "[ fig : beta ] ) , @xmath26 in equation ( [ eq : vrout ] ) can be neglected .",
    "particles larger than @xmath118 may have @xmath97 smaller than @xmath26 . for such large particles ,",
    "the radiation pressure is unimportant , even if they are above the illuminated surface . in this section ,",
    "we consider only small particles with radii less than @xmath4 .",
    "such particles have non - dimensional stopping times @xmath119 ( see fig . 2 in paper i ) .",
    "the radial velocity then reduces to @xmath120 the mass flux of the outflow in the surface layer is @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the height of the illuminated surface .",
    "the factor 2 arises from considering both the top and bottom surfaces . in the integration in @xmath7 above the illuminated surface",
    ", @xmath123 varies less rapidly than @xmath69 , and we may use its value at the illuminated surface .",

    "the dust clearing ( or the disk evolution ) time - scale is thus @xmath130    while at the surface layer particles flow outward , the particles beneath the surface layer are shielded from stellar irradiation . at such locations , the gas drag causes a net inward flow of particles as shown in paper i. from equation ( [ eq : vrout ] ) with @xmath131 , the radial velocity of particles beneath the surface layer is @xmath132 the mass flux is @xmath133 the time required for the inflow to transport a mass equal to the dust mass within @xmath6 is @xmath134 we define this as the disk evolution time through the inflow . this definition of @xmath135 does not mean the time for carrying the total dust mass outside @xmath6 to the inner part , but it is convenient for comparing with @xmath136 . comparison of @xmath136 and @xmath135 simply means comparison of the outflow and inflow fluxes . the disk clearing through the surface outflow occurs effectively only if the surface flux is stronger than the inflow flux , i.e. , @xmath137 .",
    "the comparison of these two time - scales is discussed in  [ sec : inflow ] and  [ sec : models ] below .",
    "we first discuss the disk clearing time , @xmath136 , through the surface outflow . in this subsection",
    ", we adopt the assumption that inflow flux near the midplane is negligible and that only the surface flow affects the dust structure within the disk . in  [ sec : inflow ] and  [ sec : models ] , we relax this assumption and consider more realistic scenarios including the effects of inflow near the midplane .",
    "the particles in the surface layer have outflow velocity , @xmath138 .",
    "these particles are blown from their orbits to larger radii on a time - scale @xmath139 . for disks composed of single - sized particles , @xmath140",
    "is plotted in figure [ fig : tb ] .",
    "the blow - off time for @xmath93 to @xmath4 particles is about @xmath141 yr at a few au from the star , and is about @xmath142 yr at 100 au .",
    "the blow - off time is much shorter than the inward migration time inside the disk , which is discussed in  [ sec : inflow ] below , because @xmath143 and because the stopping time @xmath144 at the illuminated surface is much longer than at the midplane .    in our standard model ,",
    "the dust disk is highly optically thick . even in the vertical direction at 100au",
    ", the optical depth is @xmath145 , so the layer above the illuminated surface is very thin .",
    "figure [ fig : surmass ] shows the ratio of the surface density of the layer to that of the whole disk ( @xmath146 ) . as the distance from the star increases , the mass ratio increases and the surface layer becomes thicker .",
    "however , even at 100 au , the mass of the surface layer is less than @xmath147 times the dust disk mass . in the case of single - sized particles ( fig .",
    "[ fig : surmass]@xmath92 ) the mass of the surface layer is smaller for disks with larger particle sizes .",
    "as the particles grow larger , they sediment more to the midplane , and the surface layer becomes thinner . on the other hand , for the mixed - sized particles ( fig .",
    "[ fig : surmass]@xmath95 ) , the mass of the surface layer does not vary significantly with the maximum size .",
    "because smaller particles exist at higher altitudes above the midplane , the surface layer is composed mainly of the smallest particles , and the quantity of smallest particles in the surface layer does not vary with the maximum size .",
    "although figure [ fig : tb ] implies that the outflow velocity at the surface layer is high , the outflow mass flux is not large because of the small mass contained in the surface layer .",
    "the disk evolution time @xmath136 through the surface outflow is shown in figure [ fig : tout]@xmath92 .",
    "the evolution time of the disk composed of @xmath96 particles is about @xmath148 at 1 au and @xmath149 at 100 au .",
    "thus , in @xmath150 yr , the dust outflow mass which has passed 1 au becomes comparable to the dust disk mass inside 1 au . if the radial motion of the dust disk occurs only through surface outflow , the particles in the innermost part of the disk will escape from the region inside 1 au in @xmath150 yr , and a hole will appear .",
    "the hole expands , and in @xmath151 yr , the radius of the hole reaches 100 au",
    ". there is , however , an accretion flow under the surface layer . inhibition of disk clearing by the accretion flow is discussed in ",
    "[ sec : inflow ] below . as the particle size increases , the evolution time increases as well .",
    "this is because particles with larger sizes concentrate more at the midplane and the surface layer becomes thinner .",
    "the blow - off time @xmath140 for a larger particle at its surface layer is also larger because of the higher local density of the gas at the lower surface layer ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tb ] ) .",
    "if the disk is composed of @xmath4 particles , it takes about @xmath152 for a disk of radius 100 au to evolve .",
    "figure [ fig : tout]@xmath95 shows the evolution times for disks composed of mixed - sized particles .",
    "the disk containing @xmath153 $ ] particles evolves in about @xmath154 yr at 1 au and in @xmath155 yr at 100 au .",
    "the disk evolution occurs mainly through the outflow of @xmath156 particles .",
    "while the surface layer is composed primarily of the smallest ( @xmath157 ) particles , these particles do not receive radiation pressure as effectively as particles with @xmath158 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : beta ] ) .",
    "thus , the surface outflow is mainly carried by a minor fraction of particles in the @xmath96 range , and the disk evolution time of the mixed - sized particles is much longer than that of the disk with the single - sized particles of @xmath96 .",
    "the evolution time increases with the maximum particle size .",
    "the dependence of the maximum size on the evolution time , however , is not as significant as in the case of single - sized particles . for disks composed of mixed - sized particles , particles of size @xmath159 form",
    "the main contribution to the surface outflow .",
    "the number density of @xmath96 particles decreases as the maximum particle size increases .",
    "however , because the thickness of the surface layer is determined by the optical depth from the star and the opacity comes mainly from @xmath156 particles , the total mass of @xmath96 particles in the surface layer does not change significantly ( fig .",
    "[ fig : surmass]@xmath95 ) .",
    "hence , the outflow flux maintains a relatively constant value .",
    "the surface outflow leads to disk clearing only if it dominates the under - surface inflow .",
    "the disk evolution time - scale , @xmath135 , through the inflow is shown as the dashed lines in figure [ fig : tout ] .",
    "as discussed in paper i , for sufficiently small particles that are well coupled to the gas , the inflow velocity is similar to the accretion velocity of the gas . in the standard model ,",
    "particles smaller than @xmath71 have velocities nearly indistinguishable from the gas throughout the disk .",
    "particles of @xmath4 decouple from the gas motion at large distances ( @xmath160 au ) and have a shorter evolution time than the gas and smaller particles .",
    "the inflowing mass flux is much larger ( 10 times or more ) than the mass flux of the surface outflow even for @xmath96 particles .",
    "therefore , the net mass flux of particles is dominated by the inflow beneath the surface layer . in the disks composed of mixed - sized particles ( fig . [",
    "fig : tout]@xmath95 ) , the inflow also dominates the net flow .",
    "the surface outflow has a very minor effect on the disk evolution in our standard model , regardless of the particle size .      in our standard model ,",
    "the surface outflow is negligible for disk evolution compared to the inflow inside the disk .",
    "this flow outcome is due to the surface layer being very thin such that its mass is a small fraction of the entire dust disk mass .",
    "the surface outflow may be important under some conditions where the surface layer is thicker or the outflow is much faster than the standard model . in this subsection",
    ", we consider several models to see under which conditions the surface outflow is important .",
    "massive young stars have a larger luminosity - mass ratio .",
    "for example , @xmath161 stars have about @xmath162 for @xmath163 yr ( dantona & mazzitelli 1994 ) .",
    "under such a high luminosity - mass ratio , the dust particles are exposed to a stronger radiation pressure ( @xmath97 is proportional to @xmath164 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : tout2]@xmath92 shows the evolution time of the disk in the case where the stellar luminosity - mass ratio is 15 times larger than the standard model .",
    "the outflow velocity is 15 times faster than in the standard model , causing the outflow mass flux to dominate the inflow at large distances ( @xmath165 au ) . in this model , dust particles which are initially outside @xmath166 au",
    "are expelled to larger distances , while particles inside @xmath166 au are accreted onto the star .",
    "it is expected that a gap around @xmath166 au forms in @xmath150 yr .      if the total dust mass is smaller , the disk optical depth is smaller so that the layer above the illuminated surface is thicker . figure [ fig : tout2]@xmath95 shows the evolution time of the disks whose masses are @xmath93 and @xmath167 times smaller than the standard disk .",
    "the mass flux of the surface outflow is almost independent of the disk mass because the mass of the surface layer , which is determined by the optical thickness , is approximately constant .",
    "therefore , the relative importance of the surface outflow , which is proportional to the mass ratio of the surface layer to the whole disk , increases with decreasing the total dust mass .",
    "the evolution time through the inflow ( see the dashed lines ) at the inner part of the disk is similar to that of the standard model , while at the outer part it decreases with decreasing disk mass .",
    "as the disk mass decreases , the gas density at the outer region of the disk becomes insufficient to keep dust particles moving together with the gas .",
    "the inward drift velocity of particles relative to the gas becomes faster for disks with smaller gas mass .",
    "for such drifting particles , the evolution time is proportional to @xmath168 ( see paper i ,  3.3.3 ) , which is constant with @xmath6 in our models ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) .",
    "for the disk with one tenth the mass as the standard model , the evolution time through the surface outflow is still longer than that of the inflow .",
    "if the disk is @xmath169 times smaller than the standard model ( the gas mass inside 100 au is @xmath170 ) , the surface outflow flux is comparable to the inflow flux at around 20 au .",
    "thus , there is no net flow at radii in the neighborhood of 20 au .",
    "the dust particles initially outside 20 au move inward until their migration is terminated at 20 au . at the same time , the particles initially inside 20 au continue to move inward and accrete onto the star .",
    "therefore , the particle migration induces accumulation of dust at 20 au and forms a ring there .",
    "gas disks around young stars are expected to dissipate in @xmath150 yr ( hartmann et al .",
    "1998 ) . when the gas mass is reduced to about @xmath171",
    ", a ring appears at a radius of a few tens of au .      in the standard model , the diffusivity of dust particles subject to turbulent motion of the gas",
    "is assumed to be the same as the diffusivity of the gas , i.e. , the schmidt number , sc , is unity .",
    "experiments show that sc can be as small as 0.1 and dust particles are much more diffusive than the gas , if the stokes number , @xmath172 , is of order @xmath169 ( e.g. , fig . 1 in cuzzi et al .",
    "the stokes number is considered to be of the same order as the non - dimensional stopping time @xmath144 . at radii of several hundred au ,",
    "@xmath173 for @xmath96 particles at the illuminated surface ( @xmath174 ) .",
    "thus , it is expected that such particles will spread to higher altitude , where they are easily blown off .",
    "figure [ fig : tout2]@xmath175 shows the evolution time for such particles with @xmath176 .",
    "the dust particles are more diffusive and are stirred up to higher altitude by turbulence than in the case of @xmath177 .",
    "the illuminated surface is located higher , where the gas density is lower and the outflow velocity is faster . the outflow mass flux , however , is still smaller than the inflow mass flux within @xmath178 au .",
    "inflow under the surface layer dominates even for the particles with high diffusivity .      in the above discussion",
    ", we mainly used models which have a power - law size distribution with a maximum size of @xmath71 .",
    "the dust particles in circumstellar disks may have evolved to sizes larger than @xmath71 ( beckwith & sargent 1991 ; mannings & emerson 1994 ; dalessio , calvet , & hartmann 2001 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : tout]@xmath95 shows the evolution time of the disks as the maximum size of the particles is varied .",
    "the evolution time through the surface outflow does not change significantly as discussed in  3.1 .",

    "the evolution time through the inflow is as small as @xmath142 yr when the largest particle is @xmath179 mm , which is much shorter than that through the surface outflow .",
    "as the particles grow larger , the surface outflow becomes less important for the overall disk evolution .",
    "we compared the surface outflow flux to the under - surface inflow flux and discussed conditions for disk clearing . in those comparisons",
    ", we assumed the dust density profiles described in  [ sec : distri ] , and neglected time variations of the dust density . in real disks , however , the dust density varies as the surface outflow proceeds .",
    "we discuss how density changes affect the subsequent evolution .    as dust particles above the illuminated surface are blown off by the stellar radiation , new particles continually diffuse into and replenish this region from below .",
    "the diffusion time over which the surface layer is re - populate is @xmath180 where we use the fact that the distance between the surface layer and the midplane is about three disk scale heights for @xmath181 and @xmath76 .",
    "the diffusion time ( @xmath70 yr at 100 au ) is much shorter than the disk evolution time @xmath136 .",
    "thus during the disk evolution , the dust in the surface layer is continuously replenished , and the surface outflow continues until the dust in the midplane is depleted .    in disks composed of mixed - sized particles ,",
    "small ( @xmath182 ) particles constitute the majorities of the surface outflow .",
    "the small particles are rapidly removed from the disk , and are continuously replenished through the collisional destruction of larger particles .",
    "the collisional time scale , @xmath183 , where @xmath184 is the particle number density and @xmath185 is the relative velocity of particles , is much shorter than the disk evolution time .",
    "for example , if we assume that the majority of the dust is composed of 1 cm particles , the relative velocity is about @xmath186 at 1 au ( from fig . 3 in weidenschilling &",
    "cuzzi 1993 ) , and the collisional time is @xmath187 yr .",
    "if the dust is composed of smaller particles , the collisional time is smaller .",
    "the outcome of the collisions , however , is not well understood , and we do not know how many small particles are produced through the collisional destruction . in this paper , we simply assume that the particle size distribution is in an equilibrium state . the minimum size ,",
    "the maximum size , and the power - law index of the distribution do not vary with time . in a realistic situation ,",
    "however , at least the maximum size would grow with time , leading to inhibition of the disk clearing , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : growth ] . calculations that take account of dust growth are needed to solve this issue .    because the disk evolution time @xmath136 is shorter at smaller radii , the dust outflow proceeds from the inner disk .",
    "the particles blown from the inner disk accumulate in the outer disk .",
    "this process increases the dust - to - gas ratio at large radii .",
    "we can ask whether this increase in the dust - to - gas ratio affects the subsequent disk evolution .",
    "suppose that the dust particles inside a radius @xmath6 are removed and an inner hole ( or a gap ) is produced .",
    "the removed particles pile up in an annulus just outside the inner hole .",
    "the width of the annulus is larger than the disk scale height . on the diffusion time @xmath188 ,",
    "the accumulated particles diffuse over a few disk scale heights both in the vertical and in the radial directions , and during a disk evolution time @xmath189 , the particles diffuse even further .",
    "thus , the surface density of the annulus increases at most by a factor @xmath190 , where @xmath191 is the width of the annulus .",
    "because the gas density does not change , the dust - to - gas ratio of the annulus becomes @xmath192 times larger .",
    "the opacity @xmath87 , which is defined for a unit mass of the gas and is proportional to the dust - to - gas ratio , also increases by a factor of order @xmath192 times .",
    "( if the particles diffuse as far as the inner hole radius @xmath6 in a disk evolution time @xmath136 , then the hole is refilled and dust removal is inhibited .",
    "the time - scale for the refill is comparable to the gas accretion time - scale @xmath193 , which is shown as the dotted lines in figure [ fig : tout ] . in the standard model ,",
    "the refill effectively inhibits the dust removal . only in the high stellar luminosity or the low mass disk cases",
    ", the surface outflow can dominate the refill . )",
    "figure [ fig : flux ] shows how the increase in the dust - to - gas ratio affects the outflow mass flux . in figure",
    "[ fig : flux ] , the outflow flux in the cases for @xmath194 ( i.e. , the dust - to - gas ratio is 10 times larger than the standard model ) and for @xmath195 ( 10 times smaller dust - to - gas ratio ) are shown with the standard model .",
    "it is seen that the outflow flux depends only weakly on the dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "the change in the dust - to - gas ratio has a slight effect on the location of the surface layer , but it hardly changes the dust mass of the surface layer .",
    "the thickness of the surface layer is determined so as to make the optical depth be unity , and its mass content does not depend on the dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "the variation in the outflow flux arises mainly from change in the location of the surface layer and from change in the angle of the incident starlight to the surface layer , and these effects are small .",
    "therefore , the accumulation of blown off particles increases the dust - to - gas ratio at the disk edge just outside the inner hole , but does not significantly decrease the outflow flux there . even after the increase in the dust - to - gas ratio in the outer disk , the surface outflow proceeds and the disk evolution continues with the time - scale plotted in figures [ fig : tout ] and [ fig : tout2 ] .      the phenomenon of surface stripping can effectively evolve the disk structure around young luminous stars whose luminosity - mass ratios are larger than @xmath196 times the solar value , as shown in ",
    "[ sec : highl ] . in the outer part ( @xmath197 au ) of such disks ,",
    "the surface outflow dominates the inflow through the midplane , causing a net outward flow . on the other hand , within 200",
    "au , the dust flows inward onto the central star .",
    "around 200 au , the dust density decreases .",
    "the outflow or inflow flux around 200 au is strong enough that it can carry the total amount of the dust inside 200 au in @xmath150 yr .",
    "this flux maintains a relatively constant value throughout the evolution even after the dust density and the dust - to - gas ratio have decreased ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : flux ] ) .",
    "consequently , the dust density declines at an almost constant rate .",
    "the time - scale for dust diffusion to transport dust from the midplane to replenish the surface layer is about @xmath198 yr at 200 au .",
    "we expect the dust density at 200 au will decline considerably in @xmath150 yr .",
    "the formation of gaps can be examined by radio observations . at 200 au , the gas surface density in the standard model is @xmath199 , which is optically thin in the vertical direction in radio continuum region around 1 mm ( @xmath200 ) .",
    "therefore , the density decline will be observed as a decrease in the optical depth .",
    "the disk is highly optically thick in the visible or near infrared light ( @xmath201 at 200 au ) .",
    "thus , the density decrease is difficult to examine directly using visible or near - infrared observations .",
    "if the gap region is shadowed by the inner disk , or if the edge of the outer disk is illuminated by the central star , the variation in the surface irradiation will probably be observed .",
    "there are a few herbig ae / be stars that show gaps in the scattered light images of their disks .",
    "the disk around hd 163296 has a dark lane at 325 au ( grady et al .",
    "hd 100546 also has a disk with a gap at 250 au ( grady et al .",
    "2001 ) . in order to make direct comparisons with these observations , we need further modeling that takes account of the time evolution of the dust density and that incorporates simulated scattered light images .    in this paper , we discussed gap formation through the surface stripping caused by radiation pressure .",
    "it is useful to discuss how to distinguish this mechanism from the other gap formation processes such as the planetary perturbations ( lin & papaloizou 1986 ; takeuchi , miyama & lin 1996 ) .",
    "obviously , the surface stripping itself can not generate non - axisymmetric features , whereas an embedded planet can . in gas - free disks , a planet forms characteristic disk structures that arises from orbital resonances ( roques et al .",
    "1994 ; dermott et al .",
    "1994 ; liou & zook 1999 ; wyatt et al .",
    "1999 ; ozernoy et al .",
    "2000 ; wilner et al . 2002",
    "; quillen & thorndike 2002 ) , and in gas disks the planet excites spiral density waves ( miki 1982 ; sekiya , miyama , & hayashi 1987 ; bryden et al .",
    "1999 ; kley 1999 ; lubow , seibert , & artymowicz 1999 ; miyoshi et al .",
    "1999 ; tanigawa & watanabe 2002 ) . the detection of such non - axisymmetric features would rule out surface stripping as a gap formation mechanism .",
    "the other notable feature of surface stripping is that it does not affect the gas density structure .",
    "the gas disks still have monotonic density structure even after the dust disks have formed gaps .",
    "therefore , detection of gaps in gas disks also rules out surface stripping . in order to explain the cause of the gaps around hd 163296 and hd 100546 , it is important to determine with future observations whether their gas disks have gaps or not .",
    "dust particles that are directly irradiated by the star move outward under the combined action of gas drag and radiation pressure . in this paper , the surface outflow of particles in optically thick disks",
    "is studied .",
    "our results are as follows .",
    "particles in the surface layer , which are directly exposed to the starlight , move outward . in a disk resembling the minimum - mass - solar - nebula ,",
    "the height of the surface layer is about three scale heights of the gas disk and the mass is @xmath202 times the total dust mass at 1 au and @xmath203 times the total dust mass at 100 au . for this case ,",
    "the mass flux of the surface outflow is much smaller than the inflow mass flux inside the disk , and the surface outflow does not contribute significantly to the dust disk evolution .",
    "the surface outflow dominates the inflow in the following cases : ( @xmath92 ) if the luminosity - mass ratio of the central star is 15 times larger than the solar value , the velocity of the surface outflow is large enough at the outer part of the disk ( @xmath204 au ) .",
    "( @xmath95 ) if the mass of the gas disk is as small as @xmath169 times the minimum - mass disk ( @xmath2 inside 100 au ) , the mass ratio of the surface layer to the whole dust disk is large enough at a few tens au . in such cases ,",
    "the surface outflow induces formation of gaps or rings .",
    "\\3 . the surface outflow is mainly composed of particles with size of order @xmath1 . as the particles grow , the largest particles around the midplane move inward more rapidly , while the outflow flux at the surface remains at a near - constant value .",
    "this results in a diminishing importance of the surface outflow for the overall disk evolution .",
