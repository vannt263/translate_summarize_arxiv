    "charge transport observed in the limit of the low electronic density is characterized by significant polaronic effects when the electron - phonon coupling is strong enough .",
    "indeed , the effects of this kind have been reported recently in a number of experiments on systems ranging from colossal magnetoresistive manganites to high-@xmath0 superconductors,@xcite which are currently the subject of great scientific interest . in this context , a better understanding of the polaron states is of particular importance .",
    "the local polaronic correlations and the polaron dispersion properties are characterized by adiabatic and nonadiabatic contributions combined with the effects due to the discreteness of the lattice . in this respect",
    "the polaron problem contains most of the conceptual elements important for the dynamics of other problems with localized solutions .",
    "in particular , the theory of quantum polarons has its analogies in the more general context of soliton physics , invoked for broad classes of materials .",
    "the experimental evidence of strongly coupled polaronic carriers is frequently provided in terms of the thermally activated d.c . conductivity , which is accompanied by a broad contribution to the mid - infrared optical conductivity .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , in photoemission spectroscopy measurements , one observes a small electron quasi - particle weight at the fermi level , with most of the spectral weight transferred towards high frequencies.@xcite in order to rationalize such strong polaronic correlations , assuming a local electron - phonon interaction , one may apply the holstein model . within the holstein model,@xcite in the strong - coupling limit the electron - phonon spatial correlations reduce to a single lattice site and one obtains heavy , strongly - pinned , small polaron states characterized by a large lattice distortion . for such states the polaron binding energy @xmath1 determines the thermal activation energy , @xmath2 , and the optical activation energy @xmath3.@xcite yet , even for quite strong couplings the adiabatic spreading of the lattice distortion over a few lattice sites might significantly reduce the pinning barrier for the polaron motion , @xmath4 . in particular , in the one - dimensional holstein model weakly - pinned small polarons with a considerable binding energy are obtained between the strong- and weak - coupling limits for moderate values of the adiabatic parameter .",
    "one of the key objectives of this work is to achieve a qualitative understanding of this interesting parameter regime , which can be relevant for unconventional small - polaron behaviors reported for various materials .",
    "the accurate treatment of adiabatic correlations is a difficult problem for itinerant polarons .",
    "several numerical methods have been recently suggested for the one - dimensional holstein model in order to spectrally resolve the polaronic correlations in the single - electron and optical conductivity spectra.@xcite these studies clearly show the fundamental difference between the nonadiabatic and adiabatic regimes , although the reliability of the methods at low frequencies is not entirely clear . in the adiabatic regime",
    "one should obtain the excited coherent polaron bands with finite spectral weight below the phonon threshold , each of the bands corresponding to one of the adiabatically softened local phonon modes.@xcite yet , the spectral weight assigned to such low - frequency adiabatic correlations seems to be reported in the literature only for the case of diagrammatic quantum monte carlo calculations .",
    "@xcite the dynamic mean - field theory ( dmft ) applied to the holstein polaron problem,@xcite exact in the infinite dimensional limit , gives only one excited coherent polaron band below the phonon threshold . for low - dimensional systems the approaches@xcite like dmft that treat the electron self - energy as a local quantity , @xmath5 ,",
    "provide approximate results .",
    "namely , in order to describe correctly the local adiabatic correlations within the diagrammatic approach , the vertex corrections involving phonons at different lattice sites @xmath6 , which contribute to the @xmath7-dependent ( nonlocal ) part of the electron self - energy @xmath8 , have to be taken into account .",
    "in fact , the important vertex corrections turn out to be those within the range of the adiabatic correlation length.@xcite this length is restricted by the distance over which the electron can move before the lattice distortion evolves significantly in time .    in order to obtain the possibly most accurate picture of the low - frequency polaronic correlations a previously developed approach@xcite of exact diagonalization of the infinite lattice polaron problem",
    "is employed here . by providing eigenenergies and corresponding wave functions , this approach , unlike any other developed up to now ,",
    "gives the complete information about the coherent part of the polaron spectrum below the phonon threshold .",
    "in addition to the polaron spectra and electron spectral properties , the phonon spectra that describe the displacement and momentum correlations of the lattice can be analyzed in this way .",
    "in fact , this work provides , to our knowledge , the first comprehensive study of lattice properties within the translationally invariant polaron theory . according to the regime of parameters ,",
    "qualitatively different behaviors of the lattice deformation field are obtained in the low - frequency range .",
    "such findings can be of experimental interest , for example , in the context of recent neutron diffuse scattering ( huang scattering ) or pulsed neutron - diffraction measurements.@xcite",
    "the holstein polaron arises from the local interaction of the electron in the nearest - neighbor tight - binding band with the dispersionless branch of optical phonons . for the one - dimensional lattice the hamiltonian reads    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the number of lattice sites ( @xmath11 ) .",

    "the bandwidths @xmath201 are exponentially reduced by the strong pinning potential due to discreteness of the lattice .",

    "this band touching corresponds to the symmetry allowed crossing of the two @xmath100 states of opposite parity .",
    "the origin of the strong hybridization of the two lowest excited bands lies with the small - polaron hopping . while the motion of the large polaron to the neighboring site corresponds to a small change of the distortion , the small polaron moves by creating the lattice distortion at one site and destroying it at the other .",
    "the displacement pattern involved in the nearest - neighbor small - polaron hopping to the right is approximately given by @xmath223 .",

    "the adiabatic dynamics contributes to the small - polaron dispersion through the softening of the internal phonon mode , which for small polarons , is obtained as a mixture of the breather and pinning modes . because of this adiabatic softening the effective hopping overlap between the polaron states at neighboring sites is larger than for the unrenormalized lattice vibrations .",

    "new important insights into the polaron formation are obtained and the crossover between the light and heavy polaron states is clarified . using the practically exact polaron states , obtained numerically by the et method , the spatial and temporal dependence of electron and lattice correlations is examined for the coherent part of the spectrum below the phonon threshold .",

    "the crossover regime involves the small polaron states , for which the adiabatic motion along the lattice is governed by a pinning potential due to the discrete lattice .",
    "it is argued that the adiabatic contributions to the effective nearest - neighbor hopping integral of such polarons are enhanced by the softening of the two lowest ( even and odd ) internal modes . in return , the polaron motion effectively couples these two modes , which results in a hybridization of the states in the first- and second - excited polaron bands below the phonon threshold .",
    "this hybridization is weak on the strong - coupling side of the crossover regime for which the excited bands are narrow and well - separated . because the pinning potential affects the low - frequency states more , the lowest band is notably narrower than the first two excited bands .",
    "as the coupling is decreased , the bandwidths of all the bands increase progressively because the pinning potential weakens .",
    "in addition , the hybridization between the two lowest excited bands becomes strong .",
    "the shifting of all the excited bands towards the phonon threshold @xmath24 on the weak - coupling side of the crossover regime indicates that the local adiabatic correlations are suppressed by the nonadiabatic contributions to the dispersion . in this regime of competing adiabatic and nonadiabatic effects ,",
    "one finds that the small polarons are light .",
    "the binding energy @xmath236 is a few @xmath24 , while the spectrum below the phonon threshold consists of two coherent polaron bands .",
    "the polaron dynamics becomes fully nonadiabatic in the weak - coupling limit , in which the coherent part of the spectrum below the phonon threshold exhibits only the lowest polaron band .",
    "the weak interaction between the electron and the lattice distortion is reflected in the small binding energy ( @xmath240 ) .",
    "the lattice correlations change remarkably among different regimes of parameters .",
    "the behavior of the phonon spectra is particularly complex in the crossover regime , in which the nonadiabatic and adiabatic contributions mix .",
    "the crossover regime connects two essentially different limiting behaviors obtained for strong and weak couplings , respectively . in the strong - coupling limit ( self - trapped polarons ) the phonon spectral weight at very low frequencies describes a classical lattice distortion , while for frequencies corresponding to the soft internal phonon modes , the spectral weight is typical for harmonic dynamics .",
    "the small @xmath241 contribution , defined by the distortion in the ground state , corresponds to the additional spectral weight that is found with respect to the free lattice .",
    "the phonon softening involves the transfer of the spectral weight from the unperturbed frequency @xmath24 to lower frequencies .",
    "as the slow quantum motion of the self - trapped polaron only weakly affects the local dynamics , the @xmath46-dependence of the phonon spectral functions describes the local spatial correlations . on the contrary , for weak couplings the polaronic distortions exhibit strong nonadiabatic quantum fluctuations due to the exchange of momentum between the electron and lattice subsystems .",
    "in particular , as the lowest polaron band approaches the phonon threshold , significant phonon softening effects are associated with long - range nonadiabatic correlations .",
    "the phonon spectral weight which corresponds to this softening can be much larger than that related to the weak - coupling distortion , which is defined by a small number of phonons in the ground state .",
