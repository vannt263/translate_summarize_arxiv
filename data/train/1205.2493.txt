    "this close behaviour was summarized in figure  34 of @xcite , where all the first masses of particle data group ( pdg ) @xcite were plotted after global translations of each species , in order to equalize the yrast mass of all species to the yrast charmed baryon mass .",

    "the masses are less defined , above an excitation of several hundred mev .",
    "it is also possible that at present , missing masses exist , which will be observed later .",
    "therefore our study concerns only the first several hundred mev excitation masses .",
    "the pdg baryonic masses @xcite are reported ( in black ) in table  1 .    when the masses change by a few mev corresponding to different charges , their mean value is kept .",
    "for example the three @xmath5 masses being respectively m = 1189.37  mev , 1192.642  mev , and 1197.449  mev , the mean value m = 1193  mev is used .",

    "the addition of the baryonic masses of a @xmath49 particle with a @xmath50 particle , is rather stable , as shown in the following example where `` n '' stands for the neutron :    m(@xmath47 ) + m(n ) = m(@xmath51 ) + m(@xmath52 )    which is verified with a precision of 1.4@xmath53 .    in the same way ,",

    ".    on the other hand , the equality is no more nearly obtained if we add the masses of two different and increasing isospin values .",
    "for example , the mass of two i = 1 baryonic particles @xmath55 compared to the sum of two i = 1/2 baryonic particles differs in a larger extend , as shown in the following example :    m(@xmath56 ) + m(@xmath57 ) and m(@xmath52 ) + m(n )    which differs by 6.8@xmath53 .",
    "the mass of two i = 1 baryonic particles @xmath55 compared to the sum of a i = 1/2 and i = 3/2 baryonic particles , differs in a smaller extend , as shown in the following example :    m(@xmath56 ) + m(@xmath57 ) = m(@xmath52 ) + m(@xmath7 )    which is verified within 1.4 @xmath53 .",
    "so the precision obtained in the mass computations shown above , can generally be of the order or better than 1@xmath53 .",
    "for example the mass of the double charmed baryon @xmath58 = 3.5189  gev @xcite can be calculated by the relation : m(@xmath58 ) = 2 m(@xmath46 ) - ( m(n ) + m(@xmath7 ) ) /2 = 3.4874  gev and the corresponding relative precision is close to y = 9 * 10@xmath42 .",

    "the mass of the @xmath47 = 2695.2  mev can be calculated by two ways , namely : @xmath60 ) = 2*@xmath61 - @xmath62 = 2480.8  mev , therefore distant by 8.3 @xmath53 , or by : + @xmath63 = @xmath64 + @xmath62 - m(n ) = 2669.6  mev , therefore distant by 0.95@xmath53 .    when applied again to yrast masses , the relation :    m(@xmath11 ) + m(n ) = m(@xmath8 ) + m(@xmath10 )    is well obtained , since the relative discrepancy between the two members of the equality is equal to @xmath65 .",
    "the equality is worse for ( not yrast ) heavier masses , since @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",

    "these results do not fit with our `` introduced '' masses .",
    "it is noticeable that the number of calculated baryonic masses is smaller than the number of experimental masses .",
    "however `` there are far less @xmath9 and @xmath3 states established experimentally than expected within quark models '' @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "the concept of `` missing resonances '' was introduced to signify the lack of @xmath6 resonances obtained within the quark models , but not observed , and in the same way missing @xmath73 states were reported @xcite .",
    "a recent review @xcite reported latest progress with a special interest to heavy and not yet observed baryons .",
    "the comparison with experimental masses is difficult for @xmath6 since the results of the calculations are presented versus different values of the pion mass squared . concerning heavier baryons , the calculations predict , below m = 1.8  gev , only one mass for @xmath8 and @xmath4 ( not studied in the present work ) , and only two masses for @xmath9 and @xmath3 baryons , therefore a much lower number than experimentally observed .",
    "there is an often discussed problem about nucleon states , predicted by quark models , but not observed experimentally .",
    "these states are called `` missing resonances '' , already mentionned . a search for these resonances via associated strangeness photoproduction",
    "was performed @xcite .",
    "the authors concluded that two such resonances , namely a @xmath74 , m = 1820  mev , and a @xmath75 , m = 1920  mev , help to improve the cross - section and the recoil polarization asymmetry between calculation and experimental data studied in the reaction @xmath76p",
