    "due to widespread interest in nanoscience and nanotechnology in the past fifteen years , persistent currents ( pcs ) and the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect in ring - type nanosystems have attracted much attention .",
    "originally , pcs and the ab effect were studied theoretically for spinless electrons in the ideal case of strictly one - dimensional ( zero - width ) metallic nanorings threaded by a solenoidal magnetic flux .",
    "@xcite subsequently , consideration of spin in this ideal case was shown @xcite to lead to a nontrivial odd - even behavior , associated with halving ( @xmath3 versus @xmath4 ) of the universal ab period and of the corresponding amplitude of the ab oscillations as a function of the applied magnetic field @xmath5 ; @xmath6 is the unit of magnetic flux .",
    "recently fabricated carbon - based new materials , like carbon nanotubes @xcite and two - dimensional graphene , provide additional opportunities for investigations of pcs and the ab effect , with potential future technological applications , in ring - type nanodevices . however , in spite of the recent extraordinary interest in graphene ( starting with the isolation of a single graphene sheet @xcite ) , only a few experimental @xcite and theoretical studies ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) of pcs and the ab effect in graphene nanorings have appeared in the last couple of years .",
    "surprisingly these graphene - ring studies have been inconclusive regarding the aforementioned odd - even behavior associated with the electron spin ; at the same time , no regular behavior or other pattern of the ab oscillations was reported . moreover",
    ", one @xcite of these publications has concluded that the odd - even behavior fails to manifest in graphene nanorings at all .    in this letter , based on extensive tight - binding calculations ,",
    "we investigate the ab oscillations for the case of trigonal and hexagonal narrow graphene rings terminating in zigzag edges ; for experimental advances in the fabrication of graphene samples with well - defined high - purity edges , see ref . .",
    "our systematic studies ( in the size range @xmath7 dirac electrons ) reveal clear signatures of several well defined patterns ( including odd - even and halved - period behaviors ) that can be traced to consideration of both the spin degree of freedom and of the zigzag boundary conditions obeyed by the graphene dirac electrons .",
    "the different conclusion arrived in this letter in comparison with previous publications @xcite appears to be due to the simplified @xcite condition ( infinite - mass boundary condition , which , unlike the zigzag condition , can not describe different crystallographic terminations and corner geometries in graphene ) used in the latter , in conjunction with the circular symmetry required for obtaining analytic solutions of the continuous dirac - weyl equation .",

    "[ bi - hxmag0z](b ) . from an inspection of fig .",
    "[ bi - hxmag0z](a ) , it is also clear that there is only a single well - formed w - state that may serve as a fermi level [ see second level from the bottom denoted by a dashed line ( online blue ) ] , and thus a halved - period sawtooth pattern occurs only once within the period of twelve electrons ( with the spin degeneracy being accounted for ) .",
    "using tb calculations and taking into account the spin , we have demonstrated the universality of the integer @xmath71 and half - integer @xmath72 magnetic - flux periods in the aharonov - bohm effect in narrow graphene rings with zigzag boundary conditions ( trigonal and hexagonal shapes were considered in both monolayer and bilayer structures ) .",
    "the ab patterns for the monolayer hexagonal rings are dominated by an odd - even ( in the electron number ) alternation of sawtooth - type oscillations with @xmath4 and @xmath3 periods .",
    "such an odd - even alternation persists also for trigonal monolayer and hexagonal bilayer rings , with a reduced occurrence frequency ( related to the number of w - states in each energy band ) .",
    "additional patterns of higher complexity are also prominent , depending on the structure of the graphene ring .",
