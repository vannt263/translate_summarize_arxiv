    "be correlated as well as independent ; we could even assume that the latter is random , but up to some lifting , this can be reduced to the deterministic case , see  @xcite . these games are therefore described by two pair of matrices : a first pair for payoffs and a second pair for messages received .",
    "players , facing uncertainties upon their payoffs , can not directly maximize them . as it is usual now",
    "@xcite , we assume that they optimize their behavior with respect to the worst possible scenario , leading to _ maxmin expected utility_.    using topological properties of linear mappings and projection , we recover surprisingly the following fundamental property of finite bi - matrix games with full monitoring ( when actions are observed ) .",
    "there exists a fixed finite subset of ( mixed ) actions containing best - replies to any action of the opponent . while obvious with full monitoring by considering whole set of pure actions , this result is not immediate with partial monitoring ( and actually incorrect in another class of games than the one considered here ) .    in the subclass of games called with _ semi - standard _ information structure , developed in section  [ se : semistand ] , this allows the construction of an auxiliary game with full monitoring such that its nash equilibria are ( in some sense ) also equilibria of the original game .",

    "* proof : * if @xmath225 and @xmath226 satisfy the non - degeneracy assumption  [ hypolh ] , any end point of the lh - algorithm is fully labelled , hence a nash equilibrium of @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath109    it is not compulsory to use the induced polytopial complexes of @xmath251 and @xmath252 .",
    "one can work directly in @xmath84 and @xmath87 by considering the projection of the skeleton of the complexes @xmath225 and @xmath226 onto them .",
    "however , the graphs generated might not be planar and there are , at first glance , no guarantee that the lh - algorithm will work . in the proof of theorem  [ mainresult ] , it is a lifting of the problem that ensures that graphs are planar .",
    "the fact that there was an odd number of nash equilibria in the game of example  [ ex : sanssemistand ] ( continued in section  [ examplesemistandardnecsuite ] below ) is therefore not surprising ; with full monitoring and the non - degeneracy assumption , this can be proved using the lh - algorithm .",
    "therefore , as soon as @xmath225 and @xmath226 satisfy this assumption , there will exist an odd number of fully labelled points in @xmath253 inducing nash equilibria .    in some cases ,",
    "the main argument of the proof of theorem  [ mainresult ] can be rephrased as follows .",
    "the game @xmath0 is , in fact , equivalent to a game @xmath254 with full monitoring , with action spaces @xmath113 and @xmath114 and with payoffs defined in a arbitrary way so that the polytopial complexes induced by the best - replies areas coincide with @xmath225 and @xmath226 .",
    "however , the existence of such abstracts payoffs might not be ensured in general ( or it can depend on the duplication of the mixed actions chosen , see example  [ examplefinal ] ) . anyway , whenever it is possible , it is again almost instantaneous to understand that nash equilibria of @xmath0 and @xmath254 coincide .",
    "[ examplefinal ] consider the game defined by , respectively , the following payoffs and signal ( in @xmath255 ) matrices for the row player :    c|c|c|c|c|p2cmc|c|c|c|c| & & & & & & & & & & + @xmath186 & 4 & 4 & 4 & 0 & & @xmath186 & ( 0,0 ) & ( 0,1 ) & ( 1,0 ) & ( 1,1 ) + @xmath189 & 3 & 3 & 3 & 3 & & @xmath189 & ( 0,0 ) & ( 0,1 ) & ( 1,0 ) & ( 1,1 ) +    given the signal @xmath256 ^ 2 $ ] , the best response is @xmath189 if @xmath257 and @xmath258 are both bigger than @xmath259 and the best response is @xmath186 is either @xmath257 or @xmath258 is smaller than @xmath259 .",
    "therefore @xmath260 is convex but @xmath261 is not ( but it is the union of two polytopes ) .",
    "assume that the column player has a full monitoring and that his four action might be best responses , then @xmath262 is not convex and the decomposition @xmath263 can not be induced by some equivalent game with full monitoring .",
    "on the other hand , one can find a decomposition of @xmath261 into two polytopes , namely @xmath264 ^ 2\\ \\mbox{s.t.}\\ \\alpha \\leq \\min ( 0.25 , \\beta)\\}\\big)$ ] and similarly @xmath265 ^ 2\\ \\mbox{s.t.}\\ \\beta \\leq \\min(0.25 , \\alpha ) \\ } \\big)$ ] .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath266 can be induced by some completely auxiliary game with full monitoring ",
    "this decomposition is said to be _ regular _ , see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 5.3 and page 132 ) . and",
    "with respect to this decomposition , @xmath267 induces the mixed action @xmath268 defined by @xmath269=\\mathbf{x}[t_1]+\\mathbf{x}[t_2]$ ] .",
    "consider again example  [ ex : sanssemistand ] . the polytopial complexes @xmath270 and @xmath271 are represented in the following figure  [ figure ] .    in order to describe how the lh - algorithm works",
    ", we will denote a vertex of the product graph by the cartesian product of its labels ( in this example the set of labels is @xmath272 ) ; for example the vertex represented with a black dot in figure  [ figure ] is denoted by @xmath273 .",
    "the first step in the lh - algorithm is to drop one label arbitrarily ; if the label @xmath11 is dropped then the first vertex visited by the algorithm is @xmath274 .",
    "the label @xmath275 appears twice , so in order to get rid of one of them , the algorithm chooses at the next step the vertex @xmath276 and the following vertex is @xmath277 .",
    "it is fully labelled , thus an end point of the algorithm , hence @xmath278 is a pure nash equilibrium of @xmath0 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath186 is dropped at the first stage , then the first vertex is @xmath279 and the second @xmath280 .",
    "so @xmath205 is also a pure nash equilibrium of @xmath0 .",
    "starting again from this point and dropping the label @xmath275 makes the lh - algorithm visit @xmath281 , and then @xmath282 which is also a nash equilibrium .",
    "it corresponds to @xmath283 which induces @xmath284 which is a ( mixed ) nash equilibrium of @xmath0 .",
    "one can check the remaining vertices of the product graph to be convinced that there does not exist any more equilibria .",
    "we now quickly treat the case of _ robust games _ where players observe their opponents actions but their payoff mapping is unknown ; the only information is that @xmath285 belongs to some polytope @xmath286 ( and @xmath287 to some @xmath288 ) . then under those assumptions uncertainties correspondence @xmath97 and @xmath219",
    "might not be piece - wise linear .",
    "assume that the payoff matrix of player 1 belongs to the convex hull of the following two matrices , i.e. , @xmath289\\}$ ] with    p0.2cmcp0.2cmp1.5cmp0.2cmc @xmath290 &    c|c|c| & & + @xmath291 & 1 & 0 + @xmath292 & 0 & 0 + @xmath293 & 0 & 1 + @xmath294 & 0 & 0 +    & & and&@xmath295 &    c|c|c| & & + @xmath291 & 0 & 0 + @xmath292 & 1 & 0 + @xmath293 & 0 & 0 + @xmath294 & 0 & 1 +    then for any @xmath296 $ ] , @xmath297\\right\\}\\ ] ] which is not piece - wise linear in @xmath19 .",
    "indeed @xmath298 can be seen as the set of product probability distributions over @xmath299 with first marginal @xmath300 .    as a consequence , lemma  [ lemmalineargeneral ]",
    "might not hold so lemke - howson algorithm can not , in general , be extended ( see e.g. ,  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5 ) for alternative technics ) . on the other hand , if both players have only 2 actions , then it is not difficult to see that @xmath97 and @xmath219 are piecewise linear ( as they can not _ turn _ as in higher dimensions ) ; so in that specific case , our results extend .",
    "important questions remains open . we have shown that under some regularity ( or non - degeneracy ) assumption on the decomposition into best reply areas , nash equilibria are induced by an odd number of points .",
    "the characterization of such games ( maybe as a large semi - algebraic class or such that a game chosen uniformly in some open ball satisfy it with probability one ) appears to be a real challenging problem here . with full monitoring ,",
    "one just has to check that vectors @xmath301 and @xmath302 are in some generic position . with partial monitoring",
    ", one must first control the fact that @xmath89 and @xmath303 are themselves in generic position , then that @xmath232 and @xmath229 also satisfy regularity conditions ; moreover , genericity can be described with respect to the mappings @xmath285 and @xmath287 ( as in full monitoring ) or to @xmath10 and @xmath11 , or to simultaneously all of them . answering this question",
    "will most probably require a deeper understanding of how normal cones evolve with @xmath304 and @xmath11 .",
    "other questions concern wether index and stability of these equilibria can be defined and studied , see  @xcite : for instance , we can wonder which equilibria remains in a neighborhood of a given game . the complexity of computing these equilibria , and wether it is in the same class than with full monitoring  @xcite , must also be addressed .",
