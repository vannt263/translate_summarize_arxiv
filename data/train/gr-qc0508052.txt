    "but if space itself is stretching , does this mean that everything in it is stretching ? are galaxies growing larger ?",
    "are atoms ?",
    "the usual answer is that `` bound '' systems do not take part in the cosmological expansion .",
    "but if space is stretching how can these systems not be at least slightly affected ? and",
    "what would it mean for a bound system to be `` slightly affected '' ?",
    "would the bound system , for example , expand at a slower rate ?",
    "would less bound systems expand more nearly with the full cosmological rate ?",
    "it turns out that these questions gets a spectrum of different answers from experts caught unprepared .",
    "part of this confusion is the indeterminacy of just what the question means@xcite . in this article",
    ", we will put aside some subtleties , we will focus on a clear simple question , and we will find a clear ( and interesting ) answer .",
    "the simple question will take the form of a simple model : a classical `` atom , '' with a negative charge of negligible mass ( the `` electron '' ) going around a much more massive oppositely charged `` nucleus . ''",
    "we will put this classical atom in a homogeneous universe in which expansion is described by an expansion factor @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is time",
    ". our goal will be to find the extent to which the growth of @xmath0 causes the atom to grow , i.e. , causes the electron orbit to increase in radius .    in the description of the atom",
    ", it will be useful to use two sets of spatial coordinates , both of them spherical polar coordinates with the massive nucleus at the origin .",
    "the first system consists of the `` physical '' coordinates @xmath2 in which @xmath3 is the proper distance from the nucleus to the electron at a given moment of time .",
    "the second set is `` cosmological '' coordinates @xmath4 ; a point at fixed values of @xmath4 is a point fixed in the stretching space of the universe and taking part in the cosmological expansion .",
    "the two coordinate systems are related by @xmath5 the angular coordinates @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the same in both the physical and the cosmological coordinates since we can think of the cosmological expansion as proceeding radially outward from the origin .",
    "the question whether the atom takes part in the cosmological expansion is then the question :  does the electron follow a trajectory of constant @xmath3 ( no atomic expansion ) , or of constant @xmath8 ( full cosmological expansion of the atom ) , or does the electron do something `` in between '' ?",
    "the nature of the expansion is encoded in the functional form of @xmath0 , and the choice of this function is the choice of the kinematics of the expanding universe .",
    "the question of what does or does not expand is a kinematical question fundamentally unrelated to the physics that constrains the form of @xmath0 .",
    "for that reason we shall use choices of @xmath9 that lead to the clearest insights , but we will comment on the relationship of these convenient examples to realistic expansion laws .    the answers given by our model contain both expected and unexpected features .",
    "an expected feature is that the comparative strengths of the expansion and of the electrical binding determine whether the atom expands .",
    "an unexpected feature is the `` all or nothing '' effect of expansion .",
    "we will see that a sufficiently loosely bound electron will expand with the universe ; it will move with constant @xmath8 . a more tightly bound electron will , after some initial disturbance of its orbit , ignore the continuing expansion and maintain constant @xmath3 . without some contrivance of special cases there is no intermediate behavior .",

    "expansion effects are introduced in this model through a very plausible phenomenological stretching force .",
    "this analysis leads to a relatively simple differential equation for the orbital radius @xmath10 . with this simple equation it is possible to get an especially clear understanding of the `` all or nothing '' feature of the atomic expansion ,    second , in sec .",

    "the result of this analysis is a differential equation for @xmath10 that differs slightly from that in sec .",

    "our model consists of an unmoving massive nucleus fixed at the origin of a spherical polar coordinate system @xmath2 .",
    "the position of an electron of mass @xmath11 orbiting in the equatorial plane @xmath12 is described by the functions @xmath10 , @xmath13 .",
