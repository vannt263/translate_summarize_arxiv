    "in this paper we present a slight modification of the fourier estimation method of the spot volatility ( matrix ) process of an it semimartingale .",
    "the method is originally introduced by paul malliavin and the third author in @xcite .",
    "the main aim of the modification is to construct an estimator of the matrix which always stays non - negative definite .",
    "a motivation of the present study is to make an implementation of the fourier method easier when it is applied to  dynamic principal component analysis \" , an important application of the spot volatility estimation ( see @xcite ) . due to the lack of symmetry of the matrices ,",
    "its estimated eigenvalues are sometimes non - positive , or even worse , non - real .",
    "this is not the case with those based on finite differences ( fd ) of the integrated volatility such as ngo - ogawa s method @xcite .",
    "however , as the fourier method has many advantages over the fd ones , among which robustness against non - synchronous observations counts most , the modification to be presented in this paper would be important .",
    "there is a by - product of the modification ; thanks to a symmetry imposed to have the non - negativity our estimator is factorized , which may save computational cost a lot .    the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "we will firstly introduce a generic form of fourier type estimators ( definition [ generic ] ) , and discuss how it works as a recall ( section [ heurietic ] ) . after remarking that the classical one is obtained by a choice of the  fiber \" ( remark [ classical ] )",
    ", we will introduce a class of such estimators ( section [ psd ] ) , each of which is labeled by a positive definite function . as a main result",
    ", we will prove its positive semi - definiteness ( theorem [ pfe ] ) .",
    "in addition , we give a remark ( remark [ reduction ] ) that with an action of finite group , some of the newly introduced positive semi - definite estimators reduce to the classical one .    in section [ parametrize ]",
    ", we will give a factorized representation of the estimator ( definition [ factorize ] ) which is parameterized by a measure by way of bochner s correspondence .",
    "the use of the expression may reduce the computation cost , as will be exemplified by simple experiments presented in section [ experiments ] .",
    "section [ measure ] gives an important remark that as a sequence of estimators , the parameterization measures should be a delta - approximating kernel .",
    "three examples of the kernels are given ( examples [ cauchy][doublef ] ) , two of which are used in the simple experiments presented in section [ experiments ] .    in the present paper , we will not study limit theorems ; consistency nor central limit theorem in detail .",
    "more detailed studies in these respects will appear in another paper .",
    "this work was partially supported by jsps kakenhi grant numbers 25780213 , 23330109 , 24340022 , 23654056 and 25285102 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a @xmath1-dimensional continuous semimartingale .",
    "suppose that its quadratic variation ( matrix ) process is absolutely continuous in @xmath2 almost surely . in this paper",

    "hereafter we normalize the time interval to @xmath8 $ ] for notational simplicity .",
    "we start with a generic form of a _ fourier estimator _ with respect to this observation set , to have a unified view .",
    "[ generic ] let @xmath9 be a finite subset of @xmath10 , @xmath11 be a  fiber \" on @xmath9 , and @xmath12 be a complex function on @xmath9 .",
    "a fourier estimator associated with @xmath13 is a @xmath14 matrix defined entry - wisely by @xmath15 where @xmath16    [ classical ] if we take @xmath17 for some positive integer @xmath18 , @xmath19 for some positive integer @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , then the estimator @xmath22 coincides with the one introduced in @xcite .",
    "in fact , with these parameters , we have @xmath23 with the dirichlet and the fejr kernels ; @xmath24 and @xmath25 we can rewrite ( [ femm09 ] ) as @xmath26      here we give a heuristic explanation of the idea behind the fourier method , which was originally proposed in @xcite , and now is extended to ( [ gf ] ) to include a class of positive semi - definite estimators that will be introduced in the next section .",
    "looking at ( [ gf ] ) or ( [ femm09 ] ) carefully , we notice that though naively , we may suppose @xmath27_u   \\\\ & + \\sum_{k \\in k } c ( k )   e^{2 \\pi i k t } \\int_0 ^ 1 \\int_0^u \\sum _ { ( s , s ' ) \\in \\mathcal{s } ( k ) } ( e^ { - 2 \\pi i s u } e^{- 2 \\pi i s ' v } dx^j_u d x^{j'}_v \\\\ & \\hspace{6 cm } + e^ { - 2 \\pi i s ' u } e^{- 2 \\pi i s v } dx^{j'}_u d x^{j}_v ) \\\\ & = : i + ii . \\end{split}\\ ] ] the term @xmath28 can be understood to be a weighted partial sum of fourier series of @xmath29 , which may converge uniformly if the weight @xmath30 is properly chosen ( in the case of ( [ femm09 ] ) , it is fejr kernel ) .",
    "the term @xmath31 vanishes , roughly because , @xmath32 behaves like a dirichlet kernel @xmath33 , which converges weakly to the delta measure .",
    "in financial applications , we are often interested in computing the rank of the ( spot ) volatility matrix .",
    "since it is positive semi - definite the rank is estimated by a hypothesis testing on the number of positive eigenvalues .",
    "the estimator ( [ femm09 ] ) , or equivalently given as ( [ femm14 ] ) , however , sometimes fails to be symmetric . ] since @xmath34 is not symmetric in @xmath35 , and thus its eigenvalues are not always real numbers .",
    "this causes some trouble in estimating the rank of the volatility matrix .",
    "here we propose a class of fourier estimators that will be proven to be symmetric and positive semi - definite .",
    "we just note that the positive semi - definiteness of the fourier estimator defined in @xcite of the integrated volatility matrix ( the @xmath36-th coefficient ) is proved in @xcite .",
    "the main result of the present paper is the following    [ pfe ] suppose that @xmath37 for some positive integer @xmath20 , @xmath12 is a positive semi - definite function on @xmath9 , and @xmath38 then , @xmath22 defined in ( [ gf ] ) is positive semi - definite .    let @xmath39 , @xmath40 be arbitrary functions on @xmath41 . from the definitions of @xmath42 , we notice that @xmath43 for the first term of the right - hand - side , @xmath44 where we set @xmath45 in the first line , changed the order of the summations in the second line , and put @xmath46 .",
    "similarly , we have @xmath47 thus we see that @xmath48    applying ( [ lm001 ] ) when @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , we obtain @xmath52 here we used an obvious change of variables @xmath53 .    now",
    "the positive definiteness follows easily .",
    "in fact , for @xmath54 , we have @xmath55 where we have put @xmath56    [ reduction ] if we set in ( [ pf ] ) @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , the estimator ( [ pf ] ) coincides with ( [ femm09 ] ) with @xmath60 .",
    "in fact , writing @xmath61 for @xmath62 , we notice that , for @xmath63 , @xmath64 and by the change of variables @xmath65 , which is an automorphism over @xmath66 , we have @xmath67      by bochner s theorem , we know that for each positive semi - definite function @xmath12 , there exists a bounded measure @xmath68 on @xmath69 such that @xmath70 therefore , we may rewrite the positive fourier estimator ( [ pf ] ) using the measure @xmath68 instead of the positive semi - definite function @xmath12 .",
    "the expression in terms of the measure @xmath68 will be useful when implementing the fourier method in estimating a spot volatility matrix .",
    "[ factorize ] let @xmath68 be a bounded measure and @xmath20 be a positive integer .",
    "we associate with @xmath71 an estimator of the spot volatility matrix as : @xmath72    under the assumptions in theorem [ pfe ] with the relation ( [ boch ] ) , we have that @xmath73 for all @xmath74 $ ] .",
    "in fact , we have @xmath75 note that @xmath76 is easily seen to be real symmetric , and thus so is @xmath22 .",
    "further , it is easier to see that @xmath76 is positive semi - definite .",
    "in fact , for arbitrary @xmath77 , @xmath78      from the observation made in ( [ heuristic ] ) , we may insist we choose a sequence of positive semi - definite functions @xmath79 , where @xmath80 for simplicity , so as that @xmath81 where the kernel @xmath82 behaves like / better than fejr one .",
    "the first example is the fejr sum case where @xmath83 or equivalently @xmath84 and therefore @xmath85 in this case , the convergence of @xmath86 in ( [ heuristic ] ) may not be good , which might be easier to be seen from the expression of ( [ pf2 ] ) .",
    "note that the estimator is completely different from the original one ( [ femm09 ] ) since @xmath87 in the former while it is always @xmath88 , independent of @xmath89 , in the latter .",
    "the factor @xmath90 contributes less to the consistency in the newly introduced positive semi - definite class of estimators .",
    "looking at the above primitive case , however , we notice that a proper choice for the measures would be implied by @xmath91    here we list possible choices .    [ cauchy ] let @xmath92 where , @xmath93 as @xmath94 . in this case , @xmath95 a cauchy kernel .",
    "[ gaussian ] let @xmath96 where , @xmath97 as @xmath94 . in this case , @xmath98 a gaussian kernel .",
    "[ doublef ] we let @xmath99 in this case , its corresponding measure is the fejr kernel ; @xmath100 @xmath101 if @xmath102 is a prime number .",
    "this can be seen by the following relation : @xmath103 which is valid when @xmath18 is a prime number and is implied by @xmath104 it is notable that in this case we need not discretize the integral with respect to @xmath105 since it is already discrete .    in the use of a delta kernel",
    ", one needs to choose properly the approximating parameters of the kernel as well as @xmath106 ; the delta approximating parameters are @xmath107 in example [ cauchy ] and @xmath108 in example [ gaussian ] .",
    "( the fejr case of example [ doublef ] is an exception ) .",
    "even with a consistency result which only tells an asymptotic behavior , one still needs to optimize the choice with some other criteria . in the next section ,",
    "we give some simulation results to have a clear view of this issue .",
    "in this section , we present some results of simple experiments to exemplify how our method is implemented ;    * we applied our estimation method to the daily data from + 31/03/2008 to 26/09/2008 of zero - rate implied by japanese government bond prices with maturities 07/12 and 07/06 , from 07/12/2008 to 07/06/2014 .",
    "* therefore , we set @xmath109 ( @xmath110 for all @xmath111 , the observation dates are equally spaced ) and @xmath112 . * we set @xmath113 for @xmath20 in ( [ pf2 ] ) and @xmath106 in ( [ kernel0 ] ) . *",
    "the integral with respect to @xmath68 is also discretized ; we only use @xmath114 $ ] instead of whole real line , which is discretized to @xmath115 . *",
    "we tested the cauchy kernel estimator with ( [ poisson ] ) in example [ cauchy ] in experiment 1 and 2 with different @xmath107 , the gaussian kernel ones of example [ gaussian ] in experiment 3 and 4 with different @xmath108 .",
    "* we used octave ver .",

    "each experiment took about 3 minutes ; plausibly fast .",
    "we see the similarities between figure [ w1 ] and figure [ w2 ] , and between figure [ w4 ] and figure [ w5 ] . in these experiments",
