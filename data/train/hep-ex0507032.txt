    "since the advent of hera , much progress has been made in determining the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) of the proton .",
    "the pdfs must be known as precisely as possible in order to make reliable predictions for any process involving protons , and to maximise the discovery potential for new physics at both current and future colliders .",
    "hera is now in its second stage of operation . with the measurements that can now be expected from hera - ii",
    ", our knowledge of pdfs should be further improved . in this paper ,",
    "first studies of the potential impact of future measurements from hera , on the pdf uncertainties , are presented .",
    "lepton - proton deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) can proceed either via the neutral current ( nc ) interaction ( through the exchange of a @xmath1 or @xmath2 ) , or via the charged current ( cc ) interaction ( through the exchange of a @xmath3 ) .",
    "the kinematics of lepton - proton dis are described in terms of the bjorken scaling variable , @xmath4 , the negative invariant mass squared of the exchanged vector boson , @xmath5 , and the fraction of energy transferred from the lepton to the hadron system , @xmath6 .",
    "the three quantities are related by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the centre - of - mass energy squared .    at leading order ( lo ) in the electroweak interaction , the double differential cross section for the nc dis process",
    "is given in terms of proton structure functions , @xmath9 where @xmath10 . the structure functions are directly related to the pdfs and their @xmath5 dependence is predicted in perturbative qcd . in particular ,",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 depend directly on the quark distributions . for @xmath13 , @xmath11",
    "is dominated by sea quarks and the @xmath5 dependence is driven by gluon radiation . at high @xmath14 ,",
    "the contribution from @xmath12 is significant .",
    "the longitudinal structure function , @xmath15 , is directly sensitive to the gluon , but is only important at high-@xmath6 . at lo ,",
    "the cc cross sections are given by , @xmath16 so that a measurement of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 cross sections at high-@xmath4 , provide information on the @xmath19- and @xmath20-valence quarks , respectively , thereby allowing the separation of flavour .",
    ".the data - sets included in the zeus pdf fits .",
    "the last two columns give the integrated luminosities of the hera - i measurements and those assumed in the hera - ii projection .",
    "note that the 96 - 97 nc and the 94 - 97 cc measurements have not had their luminosity scaled . [",
    "cols=\"<,<,^,^ \" , ]     the qcd scaling violations in the inclusive cross section data , namely the qcd compton ( @xmath21 ) and boson - gluon - fusion ( @xmath22 ) processes , may also give rise to distinct jets in the final state .",
    "jet cross sections therefore provide a direct constraint on the gluon through the boson - gluon - fusion process .",

    "the red shaded bands show the results of the zeus - jets fit and the yellow shaded bands show the results of the hera - ii projected fit.,width=566,height=340 ]",
    "in this section , the results of two separate studies are presented .",
    "the first study , provides an estimate of how well the pdf uncetrainties may be known by the end of hera - ii , within the currently planned running scenario , while the second study investigates the impact of a future hera measurement of @xmath25 on the gluon uncertainty .",
    "all results presented , are based on the recent zeus - jets pdf analysis  @xcite , which is performed in the conventional next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) dglap  @xcite framework of qcd .",
    "the fit includes the full set of zeus inclusive nc  @xcite and cc  @xcite data from hera - i , as well as zeus inclusive jet data in dis  @xcite and dijets in @xmath26p collisions  @xcite .",
    "the zeus - jets fit uses the offset method  @xcite for the evaluation of pdf uncertainties .    *",
    "pdf uncertainty estimates for the end of hera running *    the data from hera - i ( 1994 - 2000 ) are already very precise and cover a wide kinematic region .",
    "however , hera - ii is now running efficiently and is expected to provide a substantial increase in luminosity .",
    "current estimates suggest that , by the end of hera running , an integrated luminosity of @xmath27 @xmath28 should be achievable .",
    "this will allow more precise measurements of cross sections that are curently statistically limited : in particular , the high-@xmath5 nc and cc data , as well as high-@xmath5 and/or high-@xmath29 jet data .",
    "in addition to the simple increase in luminosity , recent studies  @xcite have shown that future jet cross section measurements , in kinematic regions optimised for sensitivity to pdfs , should have a significant impact on the gluon uncertainties .    in this contribution , the effect on the pdf uncertainties , of both the higher precision expected from hera - ii and the possibility of optimised jet cross section measurements , has been estimated in a new qcd fit .",
    "this fit will be referred to as the hera - ii projection , in the hera - ii projected fit , the statistical uncertainties on the currently available hera - i data have been reduced . for the high-@xmath5 inclusive data , a total integrated luminosity of @xmath27 @xmath28 was assumed , equally divided between @xmath30 and @xmath31 . for the jet data , an integrated luminosity of @xmath32 @xmath28",
    "was assumed .",
    "the central values and systematic uncertainties were taken from the published data in each case .",
    "in addition to the assumed increase in precision of the measurements , a set of optimised jet cross sections were also included , for forward dijets in @xmath33 collisions , as defined in a recent study  @xcite . since",
    "no real data are yet available , simulated points were calculated using the nlo qcd program of frixione - ridolfi  @xcite , with statistical uncertainties corresponding to @xmath32 @xmath28 . for this study , systematic uncertainties on the optimised jet cross sections were ignored .",
    "table  [ tab : heraiiassumptions ] summarises the data - sets included in the fit , and gives the luminosities of the ( real ) hera - i measurements compared to those assumed in the hera - ii projection .",
    "the results are summarised in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdfs ] , which shows the fractional pdf uncertainties , for the @xmath20- and @xmath19-valences , sea - quark and gluon distributions , at @xmath34 @xmath24 , for the zeus - jets fit compared to the hera - ii projection .",
    "note that the same general features are observed for all values of @xmath5 . in fits to only hera data , the information on the valence quarks comes from the high-@xmath5 nc and cc cross sections .",
    "the increased statistical precision of the high-@xmath5 data , as assumed in the hera - ii projected fit , gives a significant improvement in the valence uncertainties over the whole range of @xmath4 .",
    "for the sea quarks , a significant improvement in the uncertainties at high-@xmath4 is also observed .",
    "in contrast , the low-@xmath4 uncertainties are not visibly reduced .",
    "this is due to the fact that the data constraining the low-@xmath4 region tends to be at lower-@xmath5 , which are already systematically limited .",
    "this is also the reason why the low-@xmath4 gluon uncertainties are not significantly reduced .",
    "however , the mid - to - high-@xmath4 gluon , which is constrained by the jet data , is much improved in the hera - ii projected fit .",
    "note that about half of the observed reduction in the gluon uncertainties is due to the inclusion of the simulated optimised jet cross sections .",
    "the improvement to the high-@xmath4 partons observed in the hera - ii projected fit , is particularly relevant for high - scale physics at the lhc e.g. high-@xmath29 jets , new particle searches .    the longitudinal structure function , @xmath25 , is directly related to the gluon density in the proton . in principle , @xmath15 can be extracted by measuring the nc dis cross section at fixed @xmath4 and @xmath5 , for different values of @xmath6 ( see eqn .  [",
    "eqn : nc ] ) .",
    "a precision measurement could be achieved by varying the centre - of - mass energy , since @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the electron and proton beam energies , respectively .",
    "studies  @xcite have shown that this would be most efficiently achieved by changing the proton beam energy .",
    "however , such a measurement has not yet been performed at hera .    for the present study ,",
    "the impact of a possible future hera measurement of @xmath25 on the gluon pdf uncertainties has been investigated , using a set of simulated @xmath25 data - points  @xcite .",
    "the simulation was performed using the grv94  @xcite proton pdf for the central values , and assuming @xmath38 gev and @xmath39 and @xmath40 gev , with luminosities of 10 , 5 , 3 and 2 @xmath28 , respectively . under such conditions , and assuming the luminosity scales as @xmath41 , this scenario would nominally cost @xmath42 @xmath28 of luminosity under standard hera conditions .",
    "however , this takes no account of time taken for optimisation of the machine with each change in @xmath37 , which could be considerable .",
    "the systematic uncertainties on the simulated data - points were calculated assuming a @xmath43 precision on the inclusive nc cross section measurement .",
    "a more comprehensive description of the simulated data is given elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "data , for @xmath44 1.5 , 5 , 10 and 20 @xmath24 .",
    "the red shaded bands show the results of the zeus - jets fit and the yellow shadeds band show the results of the zeus - jets+@xmath25 fit.,width=566 ]    the simulated data were included in the zeus - jets fit .",
    "figure  [ fig : fl ] shows the gluon distribution and fractional uncertainties for fits with and without inclusion of the simulated @xmath25 data .",
    "the results indicate that the gluon uncertainties are reduced at low-@xmath4 , but the improvement is only significant at relatively low @xmath5 .",
