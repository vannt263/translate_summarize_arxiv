    "bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) of dilute atomic gases were first produced in 1995@xcite using laser cooling followed by evaporative cooling . to date , these two cooling methods are still the standard and indispensable steps for ultracold quantum gas studies .",
    "evaporative cooling prefers ultra - high vacuum ( uhv ) for efficient thermalization , whereas collecting large number of atoms by laser cooling needs enough particles in the background .",
    "these two contradictory requirements are the main reasons behind the complexity of typical bec uhv setups .",
    "for instance , the zeeman slower@xcite and the double magneto - optical trap ( mot ) system @xcite are two of the most common implementations to overcome this issue . here",
    "we describe a setup consists of a simple single glass cell .",
    "with the ultraviolet ( uv ) light induced atomic desorption ( liad ) , we meet the vacuum conditions at both ends and are able to produce rb becs with more than 10@xmath2 atoms repeatably .",
    "liad has been used to produce rb becs @xcite and @xmath3k degenerate fermi gases @xcite on atomic chips in single glass cells previously .",
    "the strong confinement provided by the chip makes evaporation happen very rapidly .",
    "however , the presence of a surface only hundreds of microns from the atoms makes the application of an optical dipole trap ( odt ) very challenging .",
    "the odt is especially important for our future plan of studying feshbach resonances@xcite and ultracold polar molecules@xcite . in a stainless chamber ,",
    "mimoun et al.@xcite achieved a sodium bec with liad .",
    "evaporation was carried out in pure optical traps . to maintain efficient evaporation to reach degeneracy , besides a crossed - beam odt",
    ", an additional tightly focused `` dimple '' beam had to be added . in the current work ,",
    "we have adapted the hybrid trap developed by lin et al .",
    "@xcite where a spherical quadrupole trap is used for the first stage of evaporative cooling .",
    "the pre - cooled atoms are then transfered to crossed or single beam odts with foci displaced from the magnetic field zero for further evaporation to bec .",
    "compared with the odt , a magnetic trap typically has deeper trap depth and larger trap volume",
    ". it can be mode - matched well with laser cooled atom clouds for efficient conservative trap loading .",
    "the simplest magnetic trap is of the spherical quadrupole configuration , which can be easily generated from a pair of anti - helmholtz coils . due to its superior confinement@xcite ,",
    "evaporation in this linear trap is more efficient compared with harmonic ioffe - pritchard traps before majorana loss worsens at low temperatures .",
    "the majorana hole can be plugged with a blue detuned laser beam focused to the quadrupole trap center @xcite .",
    "lin et al . instead used a far red detuned laser focused below the quadrupole center to displace the overall trap potential minimum away from zero b field @xcite .",
    "this method is easier to implement in terms of optical alignment .",
    "it also results in a bec in odt without other intermediate steps . with full strength quadrupole trap",
    ", this odt does not prevent majorana loss completely .",
    "subsequent quadrupole trap decompression transfers a large portion of the pre - cooled atoms to the new trap center defined by the odt .",
    "majorana loss is eliminated this way with the added huge gain of phase - space density because of the trap shape deformation and evaporation during the transfer . in this work ,",
    "we explore evaporative cooling of rb to bec in this hybrid trap in a very simple vacuum setup .",
    "we believe that this compact system can be useful for new groups who would like to setup a bec apparatus quickly with relatively low cost .",
    "at the center of our bec setup is a single rectangular glass cell without anti - reflection coating .",
    "the cell has outer dimensions of 100 mm@xmath440 mm@xmath440 mm and is connected to a standard cf35 cube .",
    "rubidium ( and sodium for future experiments ) dispensers ( alvatec gmbh ) are directly inserted into the glass cell from the opposite side of the cube .",
    "the distance between the dispensers and the cell center is @xmath5 12 cm , ensuring alkali atoms released from the dispensers have the most direct line - of - sight with cell walls for fast atom absorption .",
    "the vacuum is maintained by an ion pump(gamma vacuum 45s ) . a titanium sublimation pump ( varian vacuum tsp cartridge )",
    "is also installed , but it has never been fired after the initial vacuum preparation stage .",
    "standard procedures are followed to obtain uhv . at the ion pump position",
    ", the pressure reads @xmath6 torr .",
    "the pressure at the center of the glass cell is estimated to be 5 to 6 times higher limited by conductance .",
    "this is consistent with the measured magnetic trap lifetime as discussed in later subsections .    initially , to coat the glass cell walls with rb atoms , 2.5 a current",
    "is applied to one dispenser for a day .",
    "later , firing the dispenser for 15 minutes once a week is enough to replenish atoms .",
    "it is then left off during further experiment cycles .",
    "the liad light is provided by a 365 nm uv led ( thorlabs m365l2 ) with @xmath5 200 mw uncollimated power output at its maximum current .",
    "it is mounted close to the cell to reach enough localized intensity for efficient desorption .",
    "we do observe saturation behavior of the rb mot number with increasing uv light power .",
    "but it is suspected that with multiple leds to cover different parts of the cell walls , atom numbers could be further increased .",
    "the led current driver can be quickly modulated by a ttl signal synchronized with other events .",
    "similar to other groups@xcite using liad , we find that the vacuum pressure can recover within a short time scale after switching off the uv light .",
    "to allow vacuum recovery , the led is typically switched off one second before magnetic trap loading .",
    "the mot number loss during this interval is less than 10@xmath7 .",
    "our mot is in the real six - beam configuration with total laser power of 70 mw and @xmath8 beam diameters of 25 mm .",
    "the more convenient three beam retro - reflection configuration does not produce as good initial phase - spaced densities ( psd ) in the mot and molasses cooling stages .",
    "we use two home - built external cavity diode lasers ( ecdl ) @xcite to provide the trapping and repumping beams .",
    "the trap laser frequency is empirically detuned -19 mhz from the @xmath9 to @xmath10 cycling transition .",
    "the repump beam has a power of 10 mw and is on resonance with the @xmath11 to @xmath12 transition .",
    "the trap power is boosted up with a 150 mw laser diode injection locked by the trap ecdl and then delivered to the uhv cell by polarization maintaining fibers .    with liad , the mot loading time constant is typically 10 seconds .",
    "more than @xmath13 rb atoms can be collected after 20 seconds loading .",
    "the atoms then undergo a 24 ms compressed mot stage by reducing the repump power to @xmath5 150 @xmath14w and increasing the trap laser detuning to -32 mhz .",
    "a 6 ms polarization gradient cooling stage is then applied by abruptly turning off the 10 g / cm gradient and further detuning the trap laser to -78 mhz .",
    "the repump laser beams are then turned off first , followed by the trap beams 1 ms later . following these steps , @xmath15 95@xmath7 atoms in the @xmath16 = 1 manifold with temperatures around 15 @xmath14k and densities",
    "@xmath15 10@xmath17/@xmath18 are routinely achieved .",
    "after optically pumping the atoms to the @xmath19 state , @xmath20 65@xmath7 of them can be loaded into the magnetic quadrupole trap .",
    "the magnetic trap is generated from the same anti - helmholtz coil pair used for the mot field .",
    "they are wound with standard 4 mm outer diameter refrigerator copper tubes , in - house insulated by doubly - wrapped kapton tapes .",
    "pressurized water is running continuously inside to remove the resistive heating .",
    "the current applied to the coils is actively stabilized with the help of a current transducer ( lem it200-s ) and a simple electronic feedback servo . for this experiment",
    ", we use an axial field gradient of 160 g / cm .    to capture the laser cooled atoms with minimum psd loss ,",

    "we have measured the magnetic trap lifetime by mot recapturing .",
    "after different holding times , the atoms are released from the quadrupole trap by suddenly reducing the gradient from 160 g / cm to the value used for normal mot operation .",
    "the mot beams are then turned back on and the remaining atoms reveal themselves by fluorescences . as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : potential ] , at 160 g / cm , there are two potential minima as a result of the displaced optical and magnetic trap centers .",

    "for the full strength quadrupole trap , we have observed that majorana loss is still severe and evaporative cooling below 20 @xmath14k is inefficient even with the displaced odt beams .",
    "this is consistent with our understanding of the potential following fig .",

    "only the current mw setup will be described .",

    "this rate is rather fast compared with the lin et al.s experiment @xcite ( 2 seconds for the same gradient range ) .",
    "we suspect that this is due to the compromise between the larger background loss under our vacuum condition and the adiabaticity requirement .",
    "we also observe that no mw sweep is necessary in this step , while a factor of 40 increase in psd is still observed because of continuous evaporation during the potential deformation .",
    "when the gradient reaches the final value , the atoms are loaded into the crossed odt with temperatures of 14.6 @xmath14k , which is about one - eighth of the trap depth .",

    "this should result in optimal evaporation efficiency with fixed truncation factors .",
    "however , our case is complicated by thermal effect induced foci position shifts , mainly coming from the 3 mm thick pyrex cell wall .",
    "these shifts will further loosen the trap in addition to the power reduction .",
    "indeed , phase transition is already observed after lowering the power by a factor of 12 . while following the scaling law , a reduction factor of @xmath5100",
    "is needed .",
    "judging from the final bec number repeatability , we conclude that the thermal shift is reproducible to a great extent and thus further effort to minimize the shifts is not pursued .",

    "further evaporation leads to a quasi - pure condensate with @xmath58 atoms .",
    "the final trap frequencies are measured to be 2@xmath71(@xmath72)hz , along @xmath73 , @xmath26 and @xmath74 directions , respectively .",

    "while the current evaporation efficiency is still high enough for reliable condensate production , with lower initial psd , the evaporation has to be slowed down to allow enough thermalization .",
    "one - body number loss will limit the density gain in each evaporation steps and the evaporation efficiency could be further deteriorated . in the worst case ,",
    "condensate production might even become impossible .",
    "we have described a compact experimental setup capable of producing @xmath0rb bose - einstein condensates with more than @xmath58 atoms .",
    "each experiment cycle takes about 30 seconds , contributed largely by the 20 s mot loading time .",
    "the short evaporation time is made possible by the excellent initial psd , and the high evaporation efficiency of the hybrid trap .",
    "our success in condensate production with vacuum limited lifetime of 16 seconds further demonstrated the merit of the hybrid trap technique .",
    "its combination with liad makes a nice shortcut to quantum gas productions .",
    "the current setup is limited by the mot laser power . using a high power tapered amplifier and larger beam size , higher initial number and shorter mot loading times can be readily achieved .",
