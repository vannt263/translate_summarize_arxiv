    "cooperative behaviors are common in humans , and they are fundamental to our society@xcite .",
    "however , noncooperators obtain more advantages than cooperators during interactions , because cooperators tend to be exploited by noncooperators@xcite ; thus , natural selection should favor noncooperators .",
    "nevertheless , humans cooperate with each other ; therefore , they must have acquired mechanisms that ensure cooperation during the evolutionary process@xcite .",
    "since cooperators tend to be exploited by noncooperators , these evolutionary dynamics require structured interactions in which cooperators interact more frequently with cooperators and noncooperators interact more frequently with noncooperators .",
    "thus , humans must have acquired mechanisms for assortment between cooperators and noncooperators during the evolutionary process .",
    "five theoretical mechanisms have been proposed@xcite : kin selection , direct reciprocity , indirect reciprocity , spatial selection , and multilevel selection .",
    "theoretical and experimental studies have presented evidence of these mechanisms@xcite .",
    "evidence has been acquired using modeled environments with constrained behaviors of humans , or agents , to analyze their social behavior explicitly .",
    "however , it is important that this evidence be generalized to a less restrictive environment to understand human society@xcite .",
    "interactive online games are particularly powerful tools for the quantitative study of human society@xcite . in online games ,",
    "numerous players can behave more freely than is possible in the environments used in the theoretical and experimental studies @xcite , i.e. , they do not need to select from a sequence of several alternatives , because they always have multiple alternatives .",
    "in addition , the actions of all players can be recorded . in the present study",
    ", we analyzed a social network game ( sng ) , such as rage of bahamut , or girl friend beta , to understand cooperative behavior among humans , because the following features of sngs provide easier analysis of cooperative behavior .",
    "sngs allow real players to cooperate and compete with others in situations when the player s benefit is represented by a quantitative value , such as a payoff in game theory .",
    "we focused on cooperation based on direct reciprocity ( reciprocal altruism ) @xcite .",
    "the mechanism is a behavior whereby an individual acts in a manner that temporarily reduces its fitness , while increasing another individual s fitness , with the expectation that the other individual will behave in a similar manner at a later time .",
    "this behavior has been observed in humans@xcite and other primates@xcite .",
    "in addition , the possibility of this behavior has been suggested even in vampire bats@xcite and fishes@xcite .",
    "evolutionary game theory studies have also shown that reciprocal altruism drives the evolution of cooperation@xcite .    cooperation based on reciprocal altruism requires the following three conditions : 1 ) a long - term social relationship between individuals , 2 ) the capacity for individual recognition and memory of others behavior , and 3 ) greater benefits from cooperation than costs of cooperation .",
    "if these conditions are satisfied , then an individual can judge whether interactions with another individual will provide benefits .",
    "thus , cooperators increase their future benefits by cooperating with reciprocal cooperators .",
    "simultaneously , it is difficult for noncooperators to interact with cooperators , because cooperators tend to select cooperators as interaction partners@xcite .",
    "consequently , this may work as punishment inhibiting defective behavior by reciprocal cooperators with noncooperators@xcite .",
    "this study aims to investigate reciprocal altruism that generates cooperative behavior in a less restrictive environment . for this purpose",
    ", we analyzed the effects of reciprocal altruism in an sng , in which players could behave more freely than was possible in the environments used in the theoretical and experimental studies .",
    "players competed and cooperated with each other in the sng .",
    "in such an environment , players ( i.e. , humans ) obviously have the capacity for individual recognition and the memory of others .",
    "therefore , cooperation based on reciprocal altruism is expected to emerge in an sng , because the above conditions are met . in this paper , we first confirmed the presence of cooperation based on reciprocal altruism .",
    "then , we analyzed its effects to determine their benefits , and explored factors that reinforced cooperative behavior .",
    "in this section , we provide the minimal sng information and the definition of cooperative behavior in an sng ( see appendices  1 ,  2 , and  3 for game information , rules , and definition , respectively ) .",
    "we analyzed cooperative behavior in the sng , `` girl friend beta , '' in which players acquired `` event points '' and competed in the rankings based on those points , because the players received better awards as their rankings increased .",
    "the player s ranking order was determined by the sum of event points obtained in the period from 3/25/2013 to 4/8/2013 .",
    "it was impossible to analyze societal dynamics in this sng , because the rules changed frequently .",
    "the situation in the sng was also unstable in the early stage of this period ; therefore , for simplification , we used only the data from the final three days .",
    "the event points for players actions correlate significantly with their levels , one of a player s attributes .",
    "players must spend their energy to obtain event points ; therefore , the number of players actions is finite .",
    "there are two methods for replenishing these points , waiting for the points to replenish over time and using a paid item .",
    "let `` payment amount '' be the sum of money spent by each player during the analysis period .",
    "players must use their resources ( items and time ) effectively to progress to a higher ranking , because any player s time and money are finite .",
    "players belong to groups limited to 1-50 players .",
    "the sng is designed to ensure that cooperation with group members results in an effective game play .",
    "players can communicate at any time through simple text messaging .",
    "this does not negatively affect either senders or receivers ; nevertheless , its positive effects are also few points for the lottery , and the effect of the card is small , i.e. , the points do not increase players abilities . ] .",
    "we targeted groups of five or more active players who logged in at least one or more times to analyze social interactions . in addtion",
    ", we limited data to intragroup communication and cooperation .    .",
    "payoff matrix of leader game , where @xmath0 and @xmath1 , i.e. , pareto efficiency is achieved , when one cooperates and the other does not cooperate",
    ". then the cooperator obtains @xmath2 , and the noncooperator @xmath3 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in simple terms , consider that two players battled an enemy in this scenario , where their relationship is represented in table [ table_payoff_matrix ] . the relationship between the variables is @xmath4 in this payoff matrix .",
    "attack is not efficient , when @xmath2 is less than @xmath3 .",
    "however , if they do not attack the enemy , they waste time by waiting for someone else to attack , i.e. , @xmath5 is lowest .",
    "it is not possible to cooperate both players in this scenario , because an attack on the enemy by either player immediately defeats the enemy .",
    "the values of this payoff matrix depend on each players situation , e.g. , the differences between the two attack powers is larger than @xmath3 , because the attack points replenish the next morning . ] .",
    "this asymmetric diversity satisfies condition 3 for reciprocity . in the scenario , both try to avoid the worst situation ( i.e. , they get @xmath5 ) , but they also do not want to pay the cost to avoid the worst situation ( i.e. , they get @xmath2 ) .",
    "this social dilemma is similar to the one in the `` leader game '' ( table [ table_leader_payoff_matrix ] ) . in that game ,",
    "pareto efficiency is achieved when one cooperates , and the other does not .",
    "then , the cooperator receives @xmath2 , and the noncooperator @xmath3 .",
    "that is , players receive a high payoff by sharing @xmath2 and @xmath3 on repeated plays of the game , a process known as @xmath6 reciprocity@xcite .",
    "we recognized this cooperative behavior , which provided the payoff @xmath2 from one to the other , as a cooperative behavior in this scenario .",
    "cooperative behavior is an inefficient attack , as shown in table [ table_payoff_matrix ] ; thus we define @xmath7 as the attack efficiency indicator : @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the event points in player @xmath10 s @xmath11th attack and @xmath12 is the median of @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is the frequency of player @xmath10 s attacks ) .",
    "we considered cooperative behavior to be in the range of @xmath15 .",
    "we analyzed social behavior in a win-win situation in which players do not have a social dilemma , i.e. , an enemy s hit point remains sufficient .",
    "it is difficult for players to defeat the enemy alone in this situation .",
    "therefore , they request `` help '' from their group members .",
    "if the group members respond to the request , then the helper and the helped players effectively acquire event points by creating a chain of combo attacks . in addition , the group members also have their point gain increased by 1.5 times .",
    "thus , responding to a `` help '' request from group members provides benefits to helpers , irrespective of the one they help ."
