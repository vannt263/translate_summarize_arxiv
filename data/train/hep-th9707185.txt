    "qcd is generally accepted as the theory of strong interactions .",
    "it has been successfully tested in the high energy regime , where perturbation theory is applicable . on the other hand the low energy sector of the theory , and",
    "in particular the confinement mechanism is not well understood .",
    "a theoretically appealing mechanism for confinement has been proposed some time ago by t hooft and mandelstam , who conjectured that confinement is realised by the dual meissner effect @xcite .",
    "this confinement scenario assumes that the qcd ground state consist of a condensate of magnetic monopoles ( dual superconductor ) , which squeezes the colour electric field of colour charges into flux tubes .",
    "magnetic monopoles arise in yang - mills theory in the so called abelian gauges , which were proposed by t hooft @xcite .",
    "although in these gauges the magnetic monopoles arise as gauge artifacts , they may nevertheless represent the dominant infrared degrees of freedom in these gauges .",
    "the realisation of the dual meissner effect in the abelian gauges has recently received strong support from lattice calculations @xcite .",
    "these lattice calculations also show that there is a preferred abelian gauge , the so - called maximal abelian gauge . in this gauge one , in fact , observes abelian dominance and furthermore dominance of magnetic monopoles , i.  e.  about 92 % of the full string tension comes from the abelian field configurations and furthermore 95 % of the abelian string tension is reproduced by the magnetic monopoles alone @xcite .",
    "the abelian dominance indicates that the low energy sector of qcd can probably most efficiently be described in terms of an effective abelian theory .",
    "unfortunately the underlying effective abelian theory of qcd , which gives rise to the dual meissner effect , is not known .",
    "the dual meissner effect also seems to be the confinement mechanism in supersymmetric gauge theories @xcite .",
    "apparently the dual meissner effect can be most efficiently described in a dual formulation , which is known to exist for quantum electrodynamics .",
    "the transition to the dual theory basically amounts to an interchange of electric and magnetic fields , and moreover to an inversion of the coupling constant .",
    "unfortunately in the strict sense the dual theory of non - supersymmetric yang - mills theory is not known and does perhaps not exist .",
    "however , there exists a non - local formulation in terms of `` dual potentials '' which are introduced as functional fourier conjugates to the bianchi forms @xcite .",
    "furthermore , within loop space formulation of gauge theory an extended duality transformation for non - abelian theories has been introduced , which for electrodynamics reduces to the standard duality transformation @xcite .",
    "although this extended dual formulation has some attractive features as , for example , it allows to construct explicitly t hooft s magnetic disorder operator @xcite , it seems to be rather inconvenient for calculational purposes .",
    "there have been also attempts to construct the dual theory of qcd phenomenologically @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there exist a microscopic approach to the dual description of qcd , which has not been fully appreciated in the past .",
    "this is the so - called field strength approach @xcite , which reformulates the yang - mills theory in terms of the field strength tensor and comes very close to a dual description as has been recently discussed @xcite .    in the present paper by reformulating the field strength approach in the maximal abelian gauge ,",
    "we derive an effective abelian theory . for simplicity we will confine ourself to the gauge group @xmath0 . in this case",
    "we succeed to exactly integrate out the non - abelian part of the gauge field at the expense of the introduction of an abelian tensor field . as a first illustration of the emerging effective abelian theory",
    "we calculate the one - loop @xmath1-function and reproduce the standard yang - mills result .",
    "let us also mention that recently the field strength approach has been reconsidered from the point of view of the so - called bf - theory @xcite . in this context yang - mills theory can be regarded as a deformation of the bf - theory .",
    "the corresponding feynman rules and one loop @xmath1-function were considered in ref .",
    "@xcite in the lorentz gauge , making use of special properties of this gauge , like the finiteness of the gluon - ghost vertex , which is absent in the nonlinear maximal abelian gauge . in the present paper",
    "we will perform a one - loop calculation in the maximal abelian gauge in a modified field strength approach , thereby showing explicitly that vertex corrections and contributions from the charged gluon propagator cancel on one - loop level .",
    "this cancellation is similar to the background field calculation , where only the propagator of the background field contributes to the @xmath1-function .",
    "in fact , in our case the abelian gluon field figures in this context as a background field .",
    "the organisation of the paper is as follows : after fixing our conventions , we discuss the faddeev - popov gauge fixing for the maximal abelian gauge . by introducing an abelian tensor field @xmath6 similar to the field strength approach @xcite , we can exactly integrate out the charged gauge field components , resulting in an effective abelian theory given implicitly as an integral over the tensor field @xmath7 and the fp ghosts .",
    "we also investigate the general form of the resulting charged gluon propagator . by integrating out the charged gluon fields",
    "a good deal of quantum fluctuations has been included and the remaining integral over the tensor field @xmath7 can presumably be treated in saddle point approximation . in section [ sec:2.3 ]",
    ", we derive the corresponding equation of motion for @xmath7 and show that , unlike the standard field strength approach , a trivial solution @xmath8 also exists .    in section [ sec:3 ]",
    "we examine the nature of the semiclassical expansion around this trivial saddle point .",
    "as expected , it corresponds to the standard perturbative expansion . after deriving an explicit form of the effective action to one - loop order",
    ", we show in section [ sec:3.2 ] that there is a cancellation between the charged field propagators and the vertex correction , so that the @xmath1-function receives contributions only from the neutral gluon vacuum polarisation , a state of affairs familiar from the background gauge formalism .",
    "finally , we complete the calculation of the one - loop @xmath1-function by evaluating the corrections to the neutral gluon propagator .",
    "the result coincides with the known expression .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec:4 ] with an outlook on possible non - perturbative applications of our approach .",

    "the basic idea of abelian gauges @xcite is to remove as many non - abelian degrees of freedom as possible by partially fixing the gauge , leaving a theory with a residual abelian gauge symmetry .",
