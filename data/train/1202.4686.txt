    "parallelogram tilings , in particular rhomb tilings , are a fundamental family in the mathematical study of tilings , in both aperiodic order with its links to quasicrystals and in the study of random tilings .",
    "in addition they provide visual models for a wide range of mathematical structures .",
    "the most famous aperiodic parallelogram tiling is certainly the penrose tiling  @xcite in the version with rhombic tiles .",
    "many other aperiodic tilings use parallelograms as tiles , including the ammann - beenker tilings  @xcite , or more generally , all canonical projection tilings  @xcite .",
    "further examples arise in the study of geometric representations of substitutive dynamical systems , see for instance  @xcite .",
    "such models are of particular importance in the study of mathematical quasicrystals  @xcite and systems with long range aperiodic order  @xcite .    in random tilings parallelogram tilings are also of importance .",
    "usually finite tilings are considered , lozenge tilings of polygons  @xcite , or parallelotope tilings of zonotopes  @xcite , but infinite random parallelogram tilings are also studied  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on infinite tilings of the plane , but some results are also valid and relevant for finite tilings , for instance lemma  [ lem : crossing_lemma ] and lemma  [ lem : travel ]",
    ".    parallelogram tilings also turn up in the study of pseudo - line arrangements in combinatorics ( for example  @xcite ) , as a visualisation of reduced words in coxeter groups  @xcite and , through random tilings and dimer models , they link to a wide variety of physical models  @xcite .",
    "the use of parallelogram tilings in a wide variety of mathematics is discussed further on math overflow  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , there are aperiodic tilings of the plane with polygonal tiles where the tiles occur in an infinite number of orientations : the pinwheel tiling  @xcite is an example of a tiling using only one kind of tile ( a triangle with edge lengths @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) where the tiles occur in infinitely many orientations throughout the tiling .",
    "a comprehensive study of this phenomenon is  @xcite .",
    "there are also tilings using two kinds of quadrilaterals in which the tiles occur in infinitely many orientations  @xcite , see for instance the kite domino tiling in the online resource  @xcite .",
    "( click `` kite - domino '' on the main page for information about the kite domino tiling , and then `` infinite rotations '' for a list of other examples . )",
    "our main result states that such a behaviour is impossible if all tiles are parallelograms .    by definition , a parallelogram has two pairs of parallel edges . in a parallelogram",
    "tiling therefore there are natural lines of tiles linked each sharing a parallel edge with the next .",
    "these lines are called worms and were used by conway in studying the penrose tilings  @xcite .",
    "we will follow conway to call these lines _ worms_. figure  [ fig : tile_between_two_worms ] shows three ( finite pieces of ) such worms . in this paper",
    "we consider the structure of these worms and use them to prove results on parallelogram tilings . in particular , our main result states that no parallelogram tiling using finitely many different parallelograms can have tiles in infinitely many orientations .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : the first section defines the necessary terms and notations .",
    "the next section is dedicated to the proof of our main result theorem  [ thm : infinite_orientations ] .",
    "it contains several results which may be of interest on their own in the study of parallelogram tilings , for instance the crossing lemma [ lem : crossing_lemma ] or the travel lemma  [ lem : travel ] .",
    "the last section contains some additional remarks .",
    "a tiling @xmath2 of the plane @xmath3 is a packing of @xmath3 which is also a covering of @xmath3 .",
    "usually , the tiles are nice compact sets , and the tiling is a countable collection of tiles @xmath4 : @xmath5 .",
    "the covering condition can then be formulated as @xmath6 , and the packing condition as @xmath7 for @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes the interior of @xmath10 .",
    "the set of congruence classes of tiles in a tiling @xmath2 is called _ protoset _ of @xmath2 .",
    "its elements are called _ prototiles _ of @xmath2 .",
    "a tiling is called _ locally finite _ , if each ball @xmath11 intersects only a finite number of tiles of @xmath2 .",
    "a tiling @xmath2 is called _ vertex - to - vertex _ , if all prototiles are polygons , and for all tiles in @xmath2 holds : if @xmath12 is vertex of some tile @xmath13 , then @xmath14 implies @xmath15 is a vertex of @xmath16 .    *",
    "general assumption : * throughout the paper , only locally finite vertex - to - vertex tilings are considered . moreover",
    ", the the prototiles will always be parallelograms .",
    "in particular , all tiles have nonempty interior .",
    "[ def : worm ] let @xmath17 be a tile in a parallelogram tiling , and let @xmath18 be one of its edges .",
    "there is a unique tile @xmath19 sharing the edge @xmath18 with @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath20 denote the edge of @xmath19 parallel to @xmath18 .",
    "there is a unique tile @xmath21 sharing this edge with @xmath19 . repeating this yields a ( one - sided ) infinite sequence of tiles",
    "@xmath22 uniquely given by @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "repeating this on the edge of @xmath17 which is opposite of @xmath18 yields a further ( one - sided ) infinite sequence of tiles @xmath23 . in this way , @xmath17 and @xmath18 define a unique biinfinite sequence @xmath24 .",
    "we will call this sequence the _ worm given by @xmath17 and @xmath18 _ , and any such sequence just a _ worm_. the intersection of two worms @xmath25 is defined as @xmath26 .",
    "worms are also called _ de bruijn lines _ @xcite or _ ribbons _ @xcite .",
    "worms correspond to pseudo - line configurations  @xcite , and to grid lines used in the construction of canonical projection tilings by the multigrid method  @xcite .",

    "in this section we collect some basic results on worms , which will be used in the next section .",
    "the first result states that a worm can not bend `` too much '' . in order to state this precisely , we define the open cone @xmath27 with axis @xmath12 and angle @xmath28 by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 denotes the angle between @xmath15 and @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32    [ lem : cone_lemma ] let @xmath2 be some parallelogram tiling , with finite or infinite protoset . denote the infimum of all interior angles of the prototiles by @xmath33 .",
    "let @xmath34 be a worm given by some tile @xmath17 and some edge @xmath18 .",
    "denote the two endpoints of @xmath18 by @xmath35 and @xmath36 . if @xmath37 then @xmath34 is contained in @xmath38 if @xmath39 then @xmath34 is contained in @xmath40 , where @xmath41 denotes the affine span of @xmath18 .    by inspection of figure  [ fig : impossible_cones ] we observe that the worm defined by the edge @xmath18 can not intersect the cones ( shaded ) @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where @xmath37 is the smallest interior angle of the prototiles .",
    "using the prototile with the smallest angle @xmath33 alone , the worm can line up along the boundary line of one of the cones at best .",
    "if @xmath39 , the open cones are empty . nevertheless , since any tile has nonempty interior , the particular tile in the worm @xmath34 containing @xmath18 as an edge has some positive interior angle",
    "then , by the same reasoning as above , @xmath34 can not touch the line @xmath41 apart from @xmath18 .",
    "the last lemma shows also that a worm can have no loop .",
    "we state this result as a an additional lemma .",
    "[ lem : loop_lemma ] a worm has no loop .    [ lem : crossing_lemma ] two worms cross at most once .",

    "is reversed .",
    "thus no further crossing is possible .",

    "since , by construction , our sequence of worms is not crossed by any worm defined by @xmath17 , the two worms defined by @xmath17 must be contained entirely inside this loop . since worms are infinite , and tiles are not arbitrarily small , this is impossible .    it remains to consider case 3 : @xmath52 is on the right hand side of our current worm @xmath61 .",
    "there are two subcases : either @xmath61 reaches the first worm @xmath54 , defined by @xmath52 . in this case",
    "we have closed a loop again , yielding a contradiction . or @xmath61 avoids the first worm @xmath54 .",
    "now we utilize the cone lemma  [ lem : cone_lemma ] to show that this case is impossible , too .",

    "either @xmath63 intersects @xmath54 , then @xmath61 intersects our worm sequence , closing a loop . otherwise , since @xmath65 , the axis of @xmath63 is tilted towards @xmath52 , thus @xmath62 and @xmath63 have non - empty intersection .",

    "neither @xmath54 nor @xmath61 can intersect @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath54 can not intersect @xmath62 , and @xmath61 can not intersect @xmath63 , thus @xmath54 and @xmath61 have to intersect each other . this closes a loop , which yields a contradiction .",
    "thus our constructed worm sequence can not avoid @xmath17 .",
    "thus @xmath17 is reached from @xmath52 by using ( finitely many ) tiles contained in finitely many ( @xmath67 or less ) worms .",
    "[ thm : infinite_orientations ]    let @xmath68 be a parallelogram tiling with a finite protoset .",
    "let @xmath33 denote the minimal interior angle in the prototiles .",
    "each prototile occurs in a finite number of orientations in @xmath68 .",
    "moreover , the number of orientations of each prototile is bounded by a common constant .",
    "this is now an immediate consequence of lemma  [ lem : travel ] : fix some tile @xmath52 in the tiling .",
    "any other tile @xmath17 of the same shape can be reached from @xmath52 by a sequence of worms with at most @xmath69 turns .",
    "let there be @xmath70 prototiles altogether . if we can connect @xmath52 with @xmath17 without any turn at all ( i.e. , @xmath52 and @xmath17 are contained in the same worm ) there are @xmath71 possibilities how @xmath17 is oriented with respect to @xmath52 .",
    "( @xmath17 can be a translated copy of @xmath52 or a reflected copy of @xmath52 , yielding two different orientations unless @xmath52 and @xmath17 are squares . )",
    "if we can connect @xmath52 with @xmath17 using one turn , there are @xmath72 possibilities how @xmath17 is oriented with respect to @xmath52 : @xmath70 possibilities arising from the choice of the prototile defining the turn , and two possibilities for any such choice ( left - handed or right - handed ) .",
    "analoguously , for any turn there are @xmath72 possibilities of changing the orientation .",
    "thus there are @xmath73 possibilities if we need exactly @xmath74 turns .",
    "altogether , this leaves @xmath75 as an upper bound for the number of different orientations of @xmath17 with respect to @xmath52 .",
    "this is true for any tile @xmath17 congruent to @xmath52 .",
    "thus there are at most @xmath76 possibilities for the orientation of any two congruent tiles @xmath77 to each other .",
    "the tiling indicated in figure  [ fig : infinite_orientations ] demonstrates that theorem  [ thm : infinite_orientations ] is sharp , in the following sense : it becomes false if we allow an infinite number of prototiles , even if the minimal interior angle @xmath33 is bounded away from 0 . in this example , the squares labelled @xmath78 are rotated through @xmath79 with respect to the square labelled 0 ( compare figure  [ fig : infinite_orientations ] ) .",
    "the squares with even label @xmath80 are rotated through @xmath81 with respect to the square labelled 0 .",
    "thus these squares occur in infinitely many orientations in the tiling .",
    "nevertheless , the travel lemma still holds in this example : the minimum interior angle is @xmath82 ( occurring in the thinner rhomb that touches square number 2 ) .",
    "thus any tile can be connected to the square 0 by a ( finite ) sequence of tiles which is contained in a finite number of worms .",
    "the upper bound obtained in the proof of theorem [ thm : infinite_orientations ] is not optimal .",
    "for instance , the angle changes induced by turns are not always independent : the pair of turns induced by a tile of type 1 ( right - handed , say ) followed by a turn induced by a tile of type 2 ( right - handed ) yields the same relative orientation as the pair of turns induced by a tile of type 2 ( right - handed ) followed by a turn induced by a tile of type 1 ( right - handed ) .",
    "however , we do nt see how to bring this upper bound below @xmath83 .    throughout the paper we made the general assumption that all tilings are vertex - to - vertex , and that all tilings are locally finite .",
    "the requirement of local finiteness is essential , otherwise the travel lemma would become false : we can no longer guarantee that any two tiles can be connected by a finite sequence of tiles at all .",
    "the requirement that the tilings are vertex - to - vertex allows for the definition of worms .",
    "however , if the tilings are locally finite , but not vertex - to - vertex , then we can dissect each parallelogram into finitely many parallelograms such that the new tiling is vertex - to - vertex .",
    "thus all results apply also to locally finite parallelogram tilings which are not vertex - to - vertex .",
    "equivalent results to those proved in this paper should apply to tilings of @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) by parallelotopes . in order to generalise lemma  [ lem : travel ] , however , we need to enclose some tile @xmath17 with a finite collection of tiles . this would require further objects .",
    "in addition to the pseudo - lines for worms , one must also include pseudo - planes ( and pseudo - hyperplanes ) made up of linked parallelotopes sharing a parallel edge in common .",
