    "most of lead - compound crystals have the bandgap in connection with the @xmath0-to-@xmath1 gap in lead ions and tend to become highly luminescent coming from the ` odd ' transition .",
    "in fact , excitonic transitions in lead halides are partly explained by the @xmath0-to-@xmath1 transition in lead ions @xcite .",
    "luminescence in cubic pbf@xmath2 , pbcl@xmath2 , and pbbr@xmath2 is composed of broad gaussian bands with large - stokes shifts and is indicative of strong exciton  acoustic - phonon interaction @xcite while luminescence in pbi@xmath2 shows free - exciton ( fe ) natures @xcite . at the early stage of the study , the luminescence in lead halides was attributed to electric dipole transition from the @xmath1 to @xmath0 states @xcite . however , the description is too simple to explain the experimental results such as two - photon excitation spectra of photoluminescence ( pl ) @xcite .",
    "cluster calculation for cubic pbf@xmath2 , pbcl@xmath2 , and pbbr@xmath2 shows that the conduction bands consist of pb@xmath3 ( @xmath1 states ) , and the top of valence bands is composed of 68% pb@xmath3 ( @xmath0 states ) and 32% f@xmath4 ( @xmath5 states ) , 48% pb@xmath3 ( @xmath0 ) and 52% cl@xmath4 ( @xmath6 ) , and 35% pb@xmath3 ( @xmath0 ) and 65% br@xmath4 ( @xmath7 ) , respectively @xcite .",
    "the tendency of the mixed ratio in the valence bands is qualitatively supported by the recent electron - spin - resonance ( esr ) study manifesting self - trapping hole centers of pb@xmath8 in pbcl@xmath2 @xcite and br@xmath2@xmath4 in pbbr@xmath2 @xcite .    mixed crystal of pbi@xmath9br@xmath10",
    "is an example to show the variety of exciton dynamics coming from lead - halogen complex ; it enables us to observe the change from fe luminescence into self - trapped - exciton ( ste ) luminescence by increasing the ratio of bromide ions @xcite .",
    "this system implies that halogen ions add the variety in exciton dynamics and play a crucial role in realizing the localization of excitons .",
    "this example tells us that the simple description based on the inner transition of lead ions is imperfect in discussing the lattice dynamics of excitons .",
    "moreover , it was recently reported that composite luminescence in cspbcl@xmath11 , comprised of fe and ste luminescence , presents the recovery of fe - luminescence intensity and the sudden disappearance of the ste luminescence at a phase transition under the condition of raising temperature @xcite ; the excitonic transition stems from octahedrons of pb@xmath3(cl@xmath4)@xmath12 , and the crystal has the valence and conduction bands similar to pbcl@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "thus , lead - halogen complex makes it possible to realize a diversity of exciton relaxation .",

    "phosphorescent decay of the bg - pl bands in pbbr@xmath2 and pbcl@xmath2 is closely related to spatially separated electron - hole pairs as depicted in fig .  [ fig2](b ) .",
    "however , can it happen that excitons with the binding energy of about 200 mev dissociate spontaneously ?",
    "relaxed states of excitons were theoretically classified by sumi @xcite ; as a result , excitons can relax into pairs of a stel and a sth when both electrons and holes strongly interact with acoustic phonons .",
    "particularly , when the signs of coupling constants of electron  acoustic - phonon and hole  acoustic - phonon interactions are opposite , repulsive force interplays between the electron and hole via acoustic phonons .",
    "thus , the repulsive correlation is ascribable to the origin of electron - hole separation .",
    "taking all the results and discussion into account , exciton - relaxation dynamics in pbbr@xmath2 and pbcl@xmath2 is schematically depicted in fig .",
    "the spontaneous breaking of initial bound states , namely excitons , takes place by the repulsive correlation via acoustic phonons ; in view of bipolaron dynamics , the breaking is in contrast with the formation of cooper pairs mediated by acoustic phonons .",

    "figure [ fig5 ] shows the pl bands ( solid lines ) and the excitation spectra ( dashed lines ) of pbcl@xmath2 and pbbr@xmath2 below 8 k ; both of them appear in the energy range higher than the bg - pl bands . in cubic pbf@xmath2",
    ", such a pl band appears at about 4 ev . the pl components have been assigned to ste luminescence by many researchers @xcite .",
    "however , the stable range disagrees with that of self - trapped states in each crystal : in cubic pbf@xmath2 , the pl component at 4 ev is quenched around 30 k @xcite while the sths are bleached around 175 k @xcite . in pbcl@xmath2 , the pl component at 3.8 ev disappears at 25 k @xcite while the sths are stable up to 80 k and the stels appear above 60 k @xcite . in pbbr@xmath2 , the pl component at 2.7 ev disappears at 30 k while the sths become unstable at 20 k and the stel are stable up to 120 k @xcite . in addition",
    ", the pl component is mainly induced under excitation into the exciton band while the sths are induced also under interband excitation .",
    "thus , all pl components attributed to ste luminescence show vital discrepancies with the stels and sths . if the pl components are intrinsic , the stes responsible for the pl components need the different self - trapping centers from the stels and sths already detected with the esr technique ; however , further finding of the different self - trapping centers is quite improbable in these crystals .",
    "to consider the origin of the pl component , we point out that cubic pbf@xmath2 is a super - ionic conductor @xcite , and pbcl@xmath2 and pbbr@xmath2 are high - ionic conductors @xcite ; therefore , they inevitably contain dense anion vacancies at higher than 10@xmath29 @xmath30 .",
    "in particular , lattice ions are absent with a high probability in the surface region because of the halogen desorption connected to the high - ionic conductivity . the vacancies may affect and trap the excitons induced by one - photon excitation only in the surface region .",
    "the excitation profiles of the pl components in the three crystals suggest that the excitons created by one - photon excitation behave similarly in the relaxation , and moreover the excitons are not coincident with any self - trapping center found experimentally to date .",
    "therefore , the vacancy - associated relaxation of excitons seems to be a convincing explanation . at the end of discussion",
    ", we note that experimental data on cubic pbf@xmath2 are partly inconsistent @xcite ; the excitation profiles of pl component at 4 ev presented in the two references are different with each other . as for pbf@xmath2 ,",
    "further study of luminescence and structures of localized states is necessary to clarify the exciton relaxation fully .",
    "we have surveyed exciton relaxation in lead halides on the basis of recent experimental results . in pbbr@xmath2 and pbcl@xmath2 ,",
    "spontaneous exciton dissociation has been revealed with the luminescence spectroscopy and esr technique . on the other hand",
    ", pbf@xmath2 requires further investigation in view of luminescence properties and structures of localized states .    in cubic pbf@xmath2 , pbcl@xmath2 , and pbbr@xmath2 ,",
    "the pl components with similar excitation profiles are discussed from the correlation with the stels and sths , so that they are inconsistent with any stel and sth .",
    "consequently , they are unlikely to be intrinsic . to identify the origins , the examination with the optically detected magnetic - resonance technique is most preferable .",
