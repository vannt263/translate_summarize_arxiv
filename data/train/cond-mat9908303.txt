    "<S> the probability distribution of the reflection coefficient for light reflected from a one - dimensional random amplifying medium with _ cross - correlated _ spatial disorder in the real and the imaginary parts of the refractive index is derived using the method of invariant imbedding . </S>",
    "<S> the statistics of fluctuations have been obtained for both the correlated telegraph noise and the gaussian white - noise models for the disorder . in both cases , an enhanced backscattering ( super - reflection with reflection coefficient greater than unity ) results because of coherent feedback due to anderson localization and coherent amplification in the medium . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that the effect of randomness in the imaginary part of the refractive index on localization and super - reflection is qualitatively different . </S>",
    "<S> +    light propagation in disordered media and the associated anderson localization of a wave in both the active as well as the passive random media @xcitehas been studied extensively . in recent years </S>",
    "<S> , there has been increased interest in light propagation and lasing in active random media supported by the several experiments carried out on these systems @xcite . however </S>",
    "<S> the experimental findings of a narrowed spectral emission @xcite and a pulse narrowing of the emission @xcite above a well defined threshold of pumping could be explained merely as an effect of the long diffusive pathlengths in a random medium with gain and the consequent amplified spontaneous emission ( ase ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , the observed super - narrowing of the emitted spectra from strongly scattering semiconducting powder @xcite and from weak scatterers dispersed in high gain organic media @xcite has been attributed to coherent feedback caused by recurrent multiple scattering @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is , however , still debatable if the wave amplification is due to the predicted synergy between wave confinement by anderson localization and coherent amplification @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + in all these studies , the active random medium is considered to scatter the propagating wave ( light ) due to fluctuations in the real part of the refractive index @xmath0 ( real potentials ) while the coherent amplification is modelled by a phenomenological spatially constant imaginary part of the refractive index @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> however , it would be of interest to examine the effect of a spatially fluctuating imaginary part of the refractive index as well . </S>",
    "<S> more so , as the scattering micro - particles ( e.g. polystyrene microspheres , @xmath2 rutile particles ) used in the experiments are not active , a corresponding mismatch in the imaginary part of the refractive index is found to exist . </S>",
    "<S> it has been pointed out by rubio and kumar @xcite that a mismatch in the imaginary part of the refractive index ( imaginary potential ) would always cause a concomitant reflection ( scattering ) in addition to the absorption or amplification . </S>",
    "<S> mismatch in @xmath3 alone in an amplifying medium ( negative imaginary potential ) with no mismatch in @xmath4 can cause resonant enhancement of the scattering coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the reflection and the transmission coefficients can even diverge as can be seen from the simple example of a single imaginary @xmath5 potential in one dimension . </S>",
    "<S> this would correspond to the experimental situation where the scatterers ( polystyrene microspheres , say ) are suspended in a fluid with the same @xmath4 ( index matching fluid ) in which a laser dye is dissolved and optically pumped . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering caused by the fluctuations in @xmath3 would , therefore be expected to have non - trivial effects on the wave propagation in the medium . + </S>",
    "<S> the transmittance across a randomly amplifying and absorbing chain was recently considered by sen @xcite numerically and was shown to decay exponentially with the increase in length of the chain , presumably due to localization . </S>",
    "<S> but the effects of the fluctuation in the imaginary part of the refractive index on lasing in such random media has not been studied so far . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we consider the statistics of the non - self - averaging fluctuations of the reflection coefficient for light incident on a one - dimensional active random medium with spatial correlated disorder in both the imaginary part as well as the real part of the refractive index . </S>",
    "<S> + we consider a one - dimensional active disordered medium of length @xmath6 with a random complex refractive index @xmath7 . for simplicity , </S>",
    "<S> polarization effects are neglected and light is assumed to be a scalar wave . a physical realization of interest here </S>",
    "<S> would be an @xmath8 doped and pumped , polarization maintaining optical fibre intentionally disordered along its length . </S>",
    "<S> further , only the linear case of the gain / absorption being independent of the wave amplitude is considered and non - linear features such as gain saturation are not considered . here </S>",
    "<S> we would like to emphasize that our treatment is for the possibility of super - reflection ( @xmath9 ) _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. , _ for an amplifier and not an oscillator@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the complex wave amplitude @xmath10 obeys the helmhotz equation inside the medium , @xmath11 where k is the wave vector in the medium ( @xmath12 ) and @xmath13 $ ] is the complex refractive index . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath14 and @xmath15 are random and @xmath16 is a constant representing the average amplification or absorption in the medium according as @xmath16 is negative or positive . it is well known that eq.([wave ] ) can be transformed to give an equation for the evolution of the emergent quantity , namely , the complex amplitude reflection coefficient @xmath17^{1/2 } \\exp[\\imath \\theta ( l)]$ ] as a function of the sample length @xmath6 , via the method of invariant imbedding @xcite as @xmath18^{2}\\ ] ] equation.([reflect ] ) is a stochastic differential equation and we are interested in the corresponding fokker - planck equation for the probability distribution @xmath19 which can be readily obtained following the standard procedures . </S>",
    "<S> thus , let @xmath20 be the density of points in the @xmath21 phase space . </S>",
    "<S> now @xmath20 must satisfy the stochastic liouville equation @xcite , and by the van kampen lemma@xcite , the probability distribution function @xmath22 , where the angular brackets denote averaging over all the realizations of the random refractive indices @xmath23 and @xmath24 .      </S>",
    "<S> first , let us consider the simplest case namely that of a gaussian @xmath5-correlated ( white - noise ) model . in this model , @xmath23 and @xmath24 </S>",
    "<S> are assumed to have @xmath5 correlated gaussian distributions with @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> this model would most appropriately describe the case of a continuous random medium such as a laser - dye doped gel or intralipid suspension @xcite , where the fluctuations in @xmath23 and @xmath24 are uncorrelated . </S>",
    "<S> using the novikov theorem @xcite to average over all configurations of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , we obtain in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) ( _ i.e. , _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath29 ) , @xmath30 where the linear operators @xmath31 and @xmath32 are given by @xmath33 , \\\\ </S>",
    "<S> \\label{rpaop2 } { \\bf l_{i } } & = & \\frac{1}{2 } \\left [ r(r^{2}+10r+1 ) \\frac{\\partial^{2 } } { \\partial r^{2 } } + ( 5 r^{2}+30r+1 ) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r } + 2(2r+5 ) \\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the non - dimensional sample length @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the amplification length in the medium defined by the average of the imaginary part of the refractive index and @xmath39 implies the superior value of the arguments . </S>",
    "<S> the rpa is known to be valid in the the weak disorder limit , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the localization length @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that even if @xmath23 and @xmath24 were cross - correlated , the final equations do not differ in the rpa for the white - noise model ( because @xmath42 see equations ( 9),(10 ) ) . </S>"
