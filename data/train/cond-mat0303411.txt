    "the superconducting and magnetic properties of heavy - fermion materials have recently attracted much attention because of their non - conventional character .",
    "@xcite these materials have very large specific heat coefficients @xmath5 , indicating very large effective quasi - particle masses , hence the designation",
    "_ heavy fermions_. some of these materials , order antiferromagnetically at low temperatures ( examples are @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) while others ( such as @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) order in a superconducting state and others show no ordering ( such as @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) . @xcite some compounds exhibit phases where antiferromagnetic order coexists with unconventional superconductivity .",
    "examples are : @xmath16 ( @xmath17 k and @xmath18 k ) , @xmath19 ( @xmath20 k and @xmath21 k ) , cepd@xmath22si@xmath22 ( @xmath23 10 k and @xmath24 0.5 k ) and cein@xmath25 ( @xmath23 10 k and @xmath24 0.15 k ) . in the prototype heavy - fermion system",
    "ce@xmath26cu@xmath22si@xmath22 the coexistence of @xmath27wave superconductivity and magnetic order was clearly identified in a small range @xmath28 values around @xmath29.@xcite    systems that exhibit both superconductivity and antiferromagnetism at low temperature have ratios between the nel temperature @xmath30 and the superconducting critical temperature @xmath2 of the order of @xmath31 .",
    "the coexistence of both types of order can be tuned by external parameters such as external pressure or changes in the stoichiometry.@xcite    a description of the normal state properties of the heavy - fermion systems has been attempted assuming a generalization of the impurity anderson model to the lattice . @xcite in the anderson lattice the energy of a single electron in an @xmath4orbital ( e. g. @xmath32 ) is @xmath33 , and the energy of two electrons in the same @xmath4orbital ( @xmath34 ) is @xmath35 , where @xmath0 is the on - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "the energy of the @xmath34 state is much larger than the energy of the @xmath32 state .",
    "thus , if the charge fluctuations at the @xmath4orbital are small , the @xmath32 electron may behave as a local moment .",
    "the complexity of heavy - fermion systems arises from the interplay between kondo screening of local moments , the antiferromagnetic ( rkky ) interaction between the moments and the superconducting correlations between the heavy quasi - particles .",
    "the local moments form in partially filled @xmath36 shells of ce and u ions . the absence of magnetic order in some cases could perharps be due to complete kondo screening ( below the kondo temperature @xmath37 ) or to a spin liquid arrangement of the local moments . in the normal non - magnetic state",
    "the anderson lattice model predicts fermi - liquid like behaviour and explains the main features at low temperatures , such as the large effective masses and the kondo resonance near the fermi level .",
    "but the main technical difficulty is the competition between the kondo compensation of the localized spins and the magnetic interaction between them .",
    "this interaction is mediated by the conduction electrons ( @xmath38-type ) .",
    "related to this competition is the effectiveness of the compensating cloud around each @xmath36-site .",
    "the size of this cloud has been subject of controversy . while some arguments show that it should be a large scale of the order of @xmath39 @xcite , other arguments claim to be @xmath40 ( @xmath41 is the lattice constant ) .",
    "@xcite this is a relevant issue and is related to nozires exhaustion problem which states that there are not enough conduction electrons to screen the @xmath36-moments .",
    "it has been proposed that the mechanism for superconductivity lies in the strong coulomb interaction between the @xmath36-electrons , not in a phonon mediated attraction .",
    "using coleman s @xcite slave boson formalism together with a large-@xmath42 approach , various attempts have been made to search for the existence of an effective interaction which might be responsible for superconductivity in the infinite-@xmath0 anderson - lattice model .",
    "it was proposed @xcite that slave boson fluctuations can provide an effective attraction between the electrons to leading order in @xmath43 .",
    "later , a calculation of the electron - electron scattering amplitude to order @xmath44 revealed an effective attractive interaction in the @xmath45 and @xmath46 channels , which was interpreted as a manifestation of the @xmath38 interaction , showing that spin fluctuations are an important mechanism .",
    "@xcite the inclusion of @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 states , using two sets of slave bosons , was also considered in the context of the anderson lattice as a possible description of high-@xmath2 superconductors.@xcite    the magnetic order in the ground state of kondo insulators has been studied by dorin and schlottmann in the framework of the anderson - lattice model@xcite . the same authors have later studied the effect of orbital degeneracy and finite @xmath0 on a ferromagnetic ground state ( their approach did not generate rkky interactions , thus preventing the study of antiferromagnetic order).@xcite    in this work we consider the slave - boson approach to the infinite-@xmath0 anderson - lattice model . we treat the boson fields at the mean - field level , thereby enforcing the constrain of one @xmath36-electron ( at most ) per site only on the average . by splitting the boson operator into a condensate part and an above - the - condensate term , which describes fluctuations , we compute the magnetic and pairing susceptibilities at the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) level . for spin 1/2 particles the condensate density at moderate temperatures does not change much relative to its ground - state value .",
    "therefore we do not expect our results to be of less quality then those characterizing the ground - state properties .",
    "we search for the critical temperatures ( @xmath30 and @xmath2 ) at which anti - ferromagnetic order or superconducting ( @xmath50 or @xmath46-wave ) pairing occurs in a normal non - magnetic system .",
    "we find that the value of @xmath2 is much smaller than the magnetic temperature @xmath30 .",
    "unlike @xmath30 , the superconducting temperature monotonically increases with externally applied pressure .",
    "the pam hamiltonian is given by    @xmath51    where @xmath52 the @xmath53 and @xmath36 operators are fermionic and obey the usual anti - commutation relations .",

    "we consider @xmath55 .",
    "we implement the condition @xmath55 within the slave - boson formulation due to coleman , @xcite in which the empty @xmath36-site is represented by a slave boson @xmath56 and the physical operator @xmath57 in equation ( [ hcf ] ) is replaced with @xmath58 together with the constrains of only one @xmath4electron per site",
    ". the implementation of this constraint amounts to introducing a lagrange multiplier @xmath59 which will renormalize the bare @xmath4level energy from @xmath33 to @xmath60 .",
    "we split the boson operators in two terms @xmath61 where @xmath62 represents the boson condensate and @xmath63 represents the fluctuations above the condensate .",
    "this procedure leads in leading order to a mean field hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the corresponding mean field equations can be written in terms of the fourier transform of the green s functions @xmath64 as    @xmath65    and @xmath66 where @xmath67 denotes the number of lattice sites . equation ( [ z ] )",
    "states that the mean number of electrons at an @xmath36-site is @xmath68 . for a given number of particles per site , @xmath69 ,",
    "these equations must be supplemented with the particle conservation condition which yields the chemical potential @xmath70 for any temperature : @xmath71    the fluctuations beyond the mean field approach are described by the hamiltonian @xmath72 and will be considered in the calculation of the magnetic susceptibility and superconducting correlation functions below .",
    "the calculation , even at the rpa level , of the correlation functions requires the knowledge of the boson propagator .",
    "the full calculation of the latter is a technically difficult problem by itself , and is still unsolved .",
    "there are , however , @xmath43 calculations of @xmath73 .",
    "@xcite here we follow the work of evans @xcite and use an asymptotic form for the boson propagator given by @xmath74 we also adopt the same approximation for the propagator @xmath75 . in the calculation below",

    "the functions @xmath85 above are given by : @xmath86 there are three possible superconducting pairing susceptibilities that one can define .",
    "these refer to cooper pairs of either @xmath87electrons or @xmath4electrons , and a hybrid cooper pair with a @xmath87 and an @xmath4electron .",

    "moreover , we shall see below that the solutions to @xmath105 and @xmath106 both lead to the same critical temperature .",
    "therefore , the system s tendency for a certain cooper pair symmetry only shows up in the intensity of @xmath107 or @xmath108 , which is controlled by the numerator of these functions .",
    "we also see that both antiferromagnetism and superconductivity are controlled by the same interaction parameter @xmath109 , which , in turn , depends on hybridization only .    in figure [ tn ]",
    "we show a plot of the nel and superconducting temperatures as functions of the total electronic density @xmath69 .",
    "it is seen that antiferromagnetism can only occur in a very small region of electronic density .",
    "furthermore , the increase of @xmath30 when @xmath110 corresponds to an increase of the density of @xmath83 electrons towards the kondo limit ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "it is also clear that @xmath30 is not a monotonically increasing function of @xmath109 . upon reducing @xmath1 , a larger range of electronic densities",
    "can be reached where antiferromagnetic order can be found . from the inset of figure [ tn ]",
    "we see that the superconducting temperature @xmath2 is very small ( about @xmath111 ) close to the density region where the system exhibits antiferromagnetic order .",
    "the dependence of the nel and superconducting temperatures on pressure has been measured in some heavy - fermion systems @xcite . in those studies",
    "the nel temperature is found to decrease as the applied pressure increases and superconducting order is found to develop in a limited range of applied pressures , when the nel temperature is reduced below @xmath1121k .",
    "let us now see how the critical temperatures in our model vary with the model parameters which , in principle , should depend on externally applied pressure . increasing pressure should , presumably , make both the hybridization @xmath1 and the conduction band hopping @xmath113 increase @xcite .",
    "in figure [ pressure ] we present @xmath30 and @xmath2 versus @xmath1 , taking the ration @xmath114 constant .",
    "we see that above a certain value of @xmath1 the magnetic order disappears but the superconducting order remains .",
    "we also find that close to the region where the magnetic order vanishes , @xmath2 is much smaller than the maximum value attained by @xmath30 .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with experimental data on some cerium compounds ( e.g. cein@xmath25 ) , where the ratio @xmath115 .",
    "other examples are : cecu@xmath22(si@xmath116ge@xmath26)@xmath22 , where @xmath2 as function of pressure displays a positive curvature ; and cerhin@xmath117 , where the @xmath2 curve is almost parallel to pressure axis .",
    "@xcite for cecu@xmath22ge@xmath22 and cecu@xmath22si@xmath22 the @xmath2 curve initally stays almost parallel to the pressure axis , but it shoots up above a certain pressure.@xcite although @xmath2 keeps increasing as @xmath1 increases , it never reaches values comparable with the maximum value of @xmath30 , even for unreasonable values of @xmath1 as we can see in the right panel of figure [ pressure ] .",
    "we believe that a better treatment of the boson propagator will lead to a decrease of @xmath2 in agreement with the experiments .",
    "we remark that the above calculation of @xmath2 is only valid in the in a situation where the system is non - magnetic because we have not calculated @xmath101 or @xmath102 in the magnetically ordered phase .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath2 is small , the approximation employed for the boson propagator should be improved by including its low energy part .    for comparison",
    "we also plot the temperature @xmath37 defined as the difference between the renormalized @xmath4level energy @xmath118 and the chemical potential @xcite .",
    "this can be very different from the lattice kondo temperature @xcite in the non - magnetic system .",
    "nevertheless , the combined behavior of @xmath30 and @xmath37 represents the well - known doniach diagram showing the interplay between rkky and kondo screening effect . for small values of @xmath1 , @xmath37 is exponentially small and the system shows antiferromagnetic order . on the other hand ,",
    "as @xmath1 increases the kondo temperature grows , leading to kondo compensation of the @xmath4moments and to a decreasing nel temperature . for even larger values of @xmath1 complete disappearance of",
    "the magnetic order takes place and the system shows paramagnetic behavior ( assuming there are enough conduction electrons to compensate all the @xmath4local moments ) .",
    "we have also computed the superconducting critical temperature from both equations ( [ kd ] ) and ( [ kcf ] ) and obtained the same @xmath2 , as can be seen in the right panel of figure [ pressure ] . along the @xmath30 curve",
    ", @xmath83 decreases from 1 to 0.8 , as @xmath1 increases , and @xmath119 when @xmath30 is maximum .    both figure [ tn ] and figure [ pressure ] show similar behaviour near the point where @xmath120 . in both cases @xmath2 starts to increase with a positive curvature .",
    "although in many heavy - fermion systems @xmath2 presents a negative curvature , there are examples where a positive curvature have been observed , such as cepd@xmath22si@xmath22 under chemical pressure ( @xmath121 k , @xmath122 k , therefore @xmath123 ) @xcite .    since our treatment",
    "does not take competition between magnetism and superconductivity into account , we can not tell whether finite values of @xmath2 and @xmath30 imply that both types of order will be present at low temperature .",
    "nevertheless , we found in previous work @xcite , at the simplest mean field level , that magnetism and superconductivity may coexist in the system .",
    "it follows from the above remarks that the calculation of @xmath2 when @xmath30 is finite requires both the introduction of a better approximation for the boson propagator and extra electronic propagators describing the antiferromagnetic order in the system , as was done in the description of spin waves in the magnetically ordered mott insulator.@xcite    the authors want to thank p. d. sacramento for comments on the manuscript .",
