    "in the past few years , a great deal of observational evidence has accumulated in support of the @xmath17cdm cosmological model , that is to date regarded as the `` standard model '' of cosmology .",
    "one of the great puzzles related to the @xmath17cdm model , however , is the nature of the dark matter ( dm ) component that , according to the recent planck observations  @xcite , makes up roughly 27% of the total matter - energy content of the universe .",
    "a well - motivated dm candidate is the axion , that was first proposed by peccei and quinn @xcite to explain the strong cp problem , i.e. , the absence of cp violation in strong interactions .",
    "here we consider the hypothesis that the axion accounts for all the dm present in the universe .",
    "we put this `` axion dark matter '' ( adm ) scenario under scrutiny using the most recent cosmological data , in particular the observations of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature  @xcite and polarization anisotropies ( including the recent bicep2 detection of b - mode polarization @xcite ) and of baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao )  @xcite .",
    "the adm model has also been revisited by other authors  @xcite in light of bicep2 data , and our analyses in the minimal @xmath17cdm scenario agree with these previous works . however , in order to assess the robustness of the cosmological constraints presented in the literature , as well as the tension between bicep2 and planck measurements of the tensor - to scalar ratio , here we also consider extensions of the simplest adm model .",
    "the effects of additional relativistic degrees of freedom , of neutrino masses , of a dark energy equation - of - state parameter and of a free - tensor spectral index are carefully explored .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : sec1 ] introduces axions in cosmology and derives the excluded scenarios after bicep2 data .",
    "section  [ sec : sec2 ] describes the analysis method and the data used to analyse the adm models that survive after applying bicep2 bounds on gravitational waves and planck isocurvature constraints . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sec3 ] we present our main results and we draw our conclusions in sec .  [ sec : sec4 ] .",
    "in order to solve the strong cp problem dynamically , peccei and quinn postulated the existence of a new global @xmath18 ( quasi- ) symmetry , often denoted @xmath19 , that is spontaneously broken at the peccei - quinn ( pq ) scale @xmath20 .",
    "the spontaneous breaking of the pq symmetry generates a pseudo nambu - goldstone boson , the axion , which can be copiously produced in the universe s early stages , both via thermal and non - thermal processes . thermal axions with sub - ev masses contribute to the hot dark matter component of the universe , as neutrinos , and the cosmological limits on their properties have been recently updated and presented in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "here we focus on axion - like particles produced non - thermally , as they were postulated as natural candidates for the cold dark matter component  @xcite .",
    "the history of axions start at the pq scale @xmath20 . for temperatures between this scale and the qcd phase transition @xmath21 ,",
    "the axion is , for practical purposes , a massless particle .",
    "when the universe s temperature approaches @xmath21 , the axion acquires a mass via instanton effects .",
    "the effective potential @xmath22 for the axion field @xmath23 is generated through non - pertubative qcd effects @xcite and , setting the color anomaly @xmath24 , it may be written as @xmath25 \\ , , \\label{eq : potential}\\ ] ] where the axion mass is a function of temperature . introducing the misalignment angle @xmath26",
    ", the field evolves according to the klein - gordon equation on a flat friedmann - robertson - walker background : @xmath27 where the axion temperature - dependent mass is @xcite @xmath28 & m_{\\textrm{a } } ( t=0 ) \\quad & t \\lesssim \\lambda_\\mathrm{qcd } \\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\label{eq : mat1}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is a model dependent factor , see refs  @xcite , @xmath30 and the zero - temperature mass @xmath31 is related to the pq scale : @xmath32 the axion is effectively massless at @xmath33 , as it can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : mat1 ] ) .",
    "the pq symmetry breaking can occur before or after inflation .",
    "if there was an inflationary period in the universe after or during the pq phase transition , there will exist , together with the standard adiabatic perturbations generated by the inflaton field , axion isocurvature perturbations , associated to quantum fluctuations in the axion field . in this scenario ,",
    "i.e. when the condition @xmath34 is satisfied , the initial misalignment angle @xmath35 should be identical in the whole observable universe , with a variance given by @xmath36 and corresponding to quantum fluctuations in the massless axion field @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the value of the hubble parameter during inflation .",
    "these quantum fluctuations generate an axion isocurvature power spectrum @xmath39 the planck data , combined with the 9-year polarization data from wmap @xcite constrain the primordial isocurvature fraction ( defined as the ratio of the isocurvature perturbation spectrum to the sum of the adiabatic and isocurvature spectra ) to be  @xcite @xmath40 at @xmath41  cl and at a scale @xmath42  mpc@xmath43 .",
    "this limit can be used to exclude regions in the parameter space of the pq scale and the scale of inflation @xmath38 , since they are related via    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the axion mass - energy density . in this scenario ,",
    "in which the pq symmetry is not restored after inflation , and therefore the condition @xmath46 holds , and assuming that the dark matter is made of axions produced by the misalignment mechanism  , planck data has set a @xmath41  cl upper bound on the energy scale of inflation  @xcite @xmath47 very recently the bicep2 collaboration has reported @xmath48 evidence for the detection of primordial gravitational waves , with a tensor to scalar ratio @xmath49 , pointing to inflationary energy scales of @xmath50   gev @xcite .",
    "these scale would require a value for @xmath20 which lies several orders of magnitude above the planck scale and consequently nullifies the axion scenario in which the pq is broken during inflation .",
    "we conclude that , if future cmb polarisation experiments confirm the bicep2 findings , the axion scenario in which the pq symmetry is broken during inflation will be ruled out , at least in its simplest form .",
    "this conclusion could be circumvented in a more complicated scenario ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for a proposal in this direction ) but we shall not consider this possibility here .",
    "there exists however another possible scenario in which the pq symmetry is broken after inflation , i.e @xmath51 in this second axion cold dark matter scheme , there are no axion isocurvature perturbations since there are not axion quantum fluctuations . on the other hand , there will exist a contribution to the total axion energy density from axionic string decays .",
    "we briefly summarise these two contributions ( misalignment and axionic string decays ) to @xmath52 .",
    "the misalignment mechanism will produce an initial axion number density which reads @xmath53 where @xmath54 is defined as the temperature for which the condition @xmath55 is satisfied .",
    "the mass - energy density of axions today related to misalignment production is obtained via the product of the ratio of the initial axion number density to entropy density times the present entropy density , times the axion mass @xmath56 , and reads  @xcite    @xmath57 & 0.0051\\langle \\theta_i^2f(\\theta_i)\\rangle \\left(\\frac{f_{\\textrm{a}}}{10^{12}\\ \\textrm{gev}}\\right)^{3/2 }   \\quad & f \\gtrsim \\hat{f}_a \\end{array } \\right .",

    "the value of @xmath60 is an average of a uniform distribution of all possible initial values : @xmath61 if we now consider the recent bicep2 results , the value of @xmath20 , which , in this second scenario , should be always smaller than the inflationary energy scale , will always be smaller than @xmath62 and therefore , the misalignment axion cold dark matter energy density is @xmath63 as previously stated , there will also be a contribution from axionic string decays , @xmath64 .",

    "( [ eq : axionomega ] ) .",
    "all the quantities characterising the primordial scalar and tensor spectra ( amplitudes , spectral indices , possibly running ) are evaluated at the pivot wave number @xmath82 . in the baseline model we assume flatness , purely adiabatic initial conditions , a total neutrino mass @xmath83 and a cosmological constant - like dark energy ( @xmath84 ) . we also assume , unless otherwise noted , that the inflation consistency condition @xmath85 between the tensor amplitude and spectral index holds .",
    "extensions to the baseline model described above are also explored .",
    "we start by considering the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom and the sum of neutrino masses , first separately and then jointly , as additional parameters . a model with @xmath86 sterile massive neutrino species , characterised by a sterile neutrino mass @xmath87 , is also analysed .",
    "then we proceed to add the equation - of - state parameter @xmath10 of dark energy to the baseline model .",
    "finally , we also study the effect of having more freedom in the inflationary sector , by letting the running of the scalar spectral index vary or by relaxing the assumption of the inflation consistency .",
    "we use the camb boltzmann code  @xcite to evolve the background and perturbation equations , and derive posterior distributions for the model parameters from current data using a monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) analysis based on the publicly available mcmc package ` cosmomc `  @xcite that implements the metropolis - hastings algorithm .",
    "we consider the data on cmb temperature anisotropies measured by the planck satellite @xcite supplemented by the 9-year polarization data from wmap @xcite .",
    "the likelihood functions associated to these datasets are estimated and combined using the likelihood code distributed by the planck collaboration , described in ref .",
    "@xcite , and publicly available at planck legacy archive .",
    "we use planck tt data up to a maximum multipole number of @xmath88 , and wmap 9-year polarization data ( wp ) up to @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "very recently , the bicep2 collaboration has reported evidence for the detection of b - modes in the multipole range @xmath90 after three seasons of data taking in the south pole  @xcite with @xmath48 significance .",
    "this b - mode excess is much higher than known systematics and expected foregrounds , being the spectrum well fitted with a tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath49 .",
    "notice however that when foregrounds are taken into account , subtraction of different foreground models makes the best - fit value for @xmath80 move in the range @xmath91 . in the following",
    "we shall nevertheless assume that the bicep2 signal is entirely of cosmological origin .",
    "the likelihood data from the bicep2 collaboration has been included in our mcmc analyses accordingly to the latest version of the ` cosmomc ` package .",
    "we also use bao measurements , namely the sdss data release 7  @xcite , wigglez survey  @xcite and 6df  @xcite datasets , as well as the most recent and most accurate bao measurements to date , arising from the boss data release 11 ( dr11 ) results  @xcite .",
    "here we present the results for the allowed axion mass ranges in the scenario which would survive once the bicep2 findings concerning the tensor to scalar ratio and , consequently , the energy scale associated to inflation , are confirmed by ongoing and near future searches of primordial b modes . in this case , the pq symmetry should be broken after inflation .",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to such scenario in the following .",
    "tables  [ tab0 ] and [ tab1 ] depict the results for the different cosmologies explored in this study , for two possible data combinations : _ ( a )",
    "_ planck temperature data + wmap polarization ( wp ) and _ ( b ) _ planck temperature data , wp and bicep2 measurements .",
    "the constraints on the tensor to scalar ratio are quoted for a reference scale of @xmath92  mpc@xmath43 . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we do not show here all the results with the bao measurements included in the numerical analyses .",
    "we shall quote the values of the cosmological parameters resulting from the analyses with bao data included only in the cases in which these values notably differ from the results obtained without considering bao measurements .    in the standard adm model we find @xmath93ev ( @xmath94ev ) from planck , wp ( + bicep2 ) data , corresponding to a cold dark matter energy density of @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "when adding bao measurements , the former value translates into @xmath97ev .",
    "therefore , the inclusion of bao data reduces mildly the error on @xmath56 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "the exact nature of dark matter is still an open issue , involving both particle physics and cosmology . a well - motivated candidate for the role of dm is the axion , the pseudo nambu - goldstone boson associated to the breaking of the pq symmetry , proposed to explain the absence of cp violation in strong interactions .",
    "the axion can be created non - thermally in the early universe through the misalignment mechanism and the decay of axionic strings , and its mass is inversely proportional to the scale @xmath20 at which the pq symmetry is broken .",
    "this can happen , in principle , either before or after the end of inflation ; however , the large value of the tensor - to - scalar ratio implied by the recent bicep2 observations seem to exclude the first possibility , as it would imply the presence of a large isocurvature component in the primordial perturbations , far above the current observational limits .",
    "we have presented here the constraints on the  axion dark matter ",
    "scenario in which the pq symmetry is broken after inflation , using the most precise cmb data available to date ( including the recent bicep2 on the spectrum of b - modes ) , as well as the recent and most precise distance bao constraints to date from the boss data release 11 ( dr11 ) .",
    "we find that , in the minimal adm scenario , the largest dataset implies @xmath0 , corresponding to @xmath1 .",
    "these values change to @xmath2 and @xmath3 when we consider a model with an additional number of relativistic degrees of freedom @xmath4 . in that case",
    ", we also find that a non - standard value for @xmath4 is preferred at more than 95% cl .",
    "we find similar results for @xmath56 and @xmath4 if we also allow the neutrino mass to vary . for what concerns the latter parameter",
    ", we obtain @xmath7 at 95% cl for the planck+wp+bicep2+bao dataset if we fix @xmath8 ; the constraint is degraded to @xmath98 when @xmath4 is allowed to vary , due to the strong degeneracy between these two parameters .",
    "the case of @xmath86 sterile massive neutrino species , characterised by a mass @xmath87 , has also been analysed and the constraints on the axion mass are very similar to those previously quoted .",
    "we find @xmath99 and @xmath100  ev at @xmath41  cl from the combination of planck , wp and bicep2 measurements , finding evidence for extra dark radiation species at more than @xmath101 .",
    "we have also addressed other extensions to the baseline adm model , by considering , one at a time , the dark energy equation - of - state parameter @xmath10 , the tensor spectral index @xmath102 and the running @xmath103 of the scalar spectral index . in none of these extended models the results for @xmath56 change significantly .",
    "the bicep2 data , however , drive a preference for non - zero tensor spectral index or non - zero scalar running in the corresponding models .",
    "the search for axion dark matter is also the target of laboratory experiments like the axion dark matter experiment ( admx ) @xcite , that uses a tunable microwave cavity positioned in a high magnetic field to detect the conversion of axions into photons .",
    "this is enhanced at a resonant frequency @xmath104 ; for the typical masses found in our study , this corresponds to a frequency @xmath105 ghz .",
    "admx has been operating in the range @xmath106 , thus being able to exclude dm axions in the mass range between 1.9 and 3.53 @xmath107ev @xcite .",
    "admx is currently undergoing an upgrade that will extend its frequency range up to a few ghzs ( i.e. , masses in the @xmath108 range ) @xcite , which is unfortunately still not enough to detect dm axions in the mass range implied by cosmological observations , that corresponds , for a given of @xmath109 , to the smallest value of the axion mass .",
    "we also note that it does not help either if axions only make up for part of the total dm content of the universe .",
    "in fact , since @xmath110 , having @xmath111 would just shift the resonant frequency to even higher values . ] , if the pq symmetry is broken after inflation ( as implied by the recent bicep2 data ) .",
    "however , a second , smaller experiment called admx - hf is currently being built , that will allow to probe the @xmath15 ghz range @xcite , thus being in principle sensitive to axion masses in the @xmath112 range , allowing to directly test the adm scenario , at least in its simplest implementation .",

    "<S> dark matter axions with mass in the @xmath13 range can , in principle , be detected by looking for axion - to - photon conversion occurring inside a tunable microwave cavity permeated by a high - intensity magnetic field , and operating at a frequency @xmath14 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> this is out of the reach of current experiments like admx ( limited to a maximum frequency of a few ghzs ) , but is , on the other hand , within the reach of the upcoming admx - hf experiment , that will explore the @xmath15 ghz frequency range and then being sensitive to axions masses up to @xmath16 . </S>"
