    "one of the most salient open problems in classical general relativity ( gr ) is proving the stability of the outer region of the stationary electro - vacuum black holes in the kerr - newman family .",
    "a complete proof of stability in the context of the non linear gr equations has only been given for minkowski spacetime @xcite ; the stability problem of more complex solutions of einstein s equation is usually approached by analyzing the behavior of linear test fields satisfying appropriate boundary conditions in order to establish if unbounded solutions are allowed .",
    "scalar test fields provide a first clue , whereas gravitational waves , that is , metric perturbations @xmath7 propagating on the background spacetime @xmath8 , give a more realistic approach to the problem . for vacuum spacetimes , assuming a cosmological constant @xmath0 , the metric perturbation @xmath7 satisfies the linearized einstein equation ( lee ) @xmath9 : = - \\tfrac{1}{2 } \\nabla^{{\\gamma } } \\nabla_{{\\gamma } } h_{{\\alpha}{\\beta } }   - \\tfrac{1}{2 } \\nabla_{{\\alpha } } \\nabla_{{\\beta } } ( g^{{\\gamma}{\\delta } } h_{{\\gamma}{\\delta } } ) +    \\nabla^{{\\gamma } } \\nabla_{({\\alpha } } h_{{\\beta } ) { \\gamma } } - \\lambda \\ ;   h_{{\\alpha}{\\beta } } = 0,\\ ] ] obtained by assuming that on a fixed four dimensional manifold @xmath10 ( the spacetime ) there is a mono - parametric family of solutions @xmath11 of the vacuum einstein field equation @xmath12 - \\lambda g_{{\\alpha}{\\beta}}({\\epsilon})=0\\ ] ] around the ",

    "trivial solutions of this equation are @xmath22 where @xmath23 is an arbitrary vector field ; these amount to the first order in @xmath15 change of the metric under the pullback by the flow @xmath24 generated by the vector field @xmath23 .",
    "any two solutions @xmath7 and @xmath25 such that @xmath26 are related by this diffeomorphism and thus physically equivalent , this being the _ gauge freedom _ of linearized gravity .",

    "+ curvature related scalar fields ( cs for short , not to be confused with the tetrad components of the weyl tensor in the newman - penrose formalism ) , are scalar fields obtained by a full contraction of a polynomial in the riemann tensor and its covariant derivatives , the metric and the volume form . although these fields partially characterize the metric , it is well known that the information they carry is limited , an extreme example of this fact being the _ vanishing scalar invariants spacetimes _ , which have a nonzero riemann tensor and yet _ every _ cs vanishes @xcite .",
    "this fact may suggest that the perturbation of cs under a given solution @xmath7 of the lee provide very limited information on @xmath7 .",

    "it was shown in @xcite that the linear map @xmath42 \\to \\left ( g_{-}\\left([h_{{\\alpha}{\\beta } } ] \\right ) ,   g_{+}\\left([h_{{\\alpha}{\\beta } } ] \\right ) \\right)\\ ] ] with domain the equivalence classes of smooth solutions of the lee preserving the asymptotic flatness , is injective .",

    "given that the scalars @xmath1 contain _ all _ the gauge invariant information on the perturbation , the fact that they remain bounded as the perturbation evolves through spacetime gives a meaningful notion of linear stability .",
    "+ this concept of stability , that we call _ nonmodal _ , should be compared with prior linear gravity stability notions for the schwarzschild black hole . to this end",
    "we review the results in a short list of papers that were crucial in the development of this subject .",
    "it is important to stress that they all use the spherical symmetry of the schwarzschild spacetime to decompose a metric perturbation @xmath46 into even ( @xmath47 ) and odd ( @xmath48 ) @xmath49 _ modes_. here @xmath50 refers to the eigenspace of the laplace - beltrami operator acting on real scalar fields on @xmath51 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath52 , @xmath53 is an index labeling a particular basis of this @xmath54 dimensional space , and the parity @xmath55 accounts for the way @xmath56 transforms when pull - backed by the antipodal map on @xmath51 ( for details refer to section [ cstf ] ) .",
    "+ the first work on the linear stability of the schwarzschild black hole is t. regge and j. wheeler 1957 paper @xcite , where the decomposition ( [ dec ] ) was proposed and the @xmath57 modes where recognized to be non - dynamical . at the time",
    "the very notion of black hole was unclear ( the term `` black hole '' was coined by j. wheeler some ten years later ) , and kerr s solution had not yet been discovered .",
    "this is probably why , although the @xmath58 even piece of the perturbation was readily identified as a mass shift in @xcite , the odd @xmath59 modes , which corresponds to perturbing along a kerr family @xmath11 with @xmath60 , was misunderstood ( see the paragraph between equations ( 37 ) and ( 38 ) in @xcite ) and the opportunity of producing a `` slowly rotating '' black hole at a time when there was no clue about a rotating black hole solution was missed .",
    "the decomposition ( [ dec ] ) in @xcite was done in schwarzschild coordinates @xmath61 in what came to be called the regge - wheeler ( rw , for short ) gauge .",
    "the lee in the even and odd sectors were shown to decouple , and the dynamical odd sector of the lee reduced to an infinite set of two dimensional wave equations , individually know as the rw equation : @xmath62 where ( adding a cosmological constant @xmath0 for future reference ) @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 the @xmath66 even sector lee , a much more intricate system of equations , was disentangled by f. zerilli in his 1970 paper @xcite and shown to be equivalent to the wave equations @xmath67 with potentials @xmath68 r^3 + 6 \\mu^2 m r^2 + 36 \\mu m^2 r + 72m^3}{r^3 \\ ;   ( 6m+ \\mu r)^2 } , \\;\\ ; \\mu=(\\ell-1)(\\ell+2).\\ ] ] for @xmath69 the rw and zerilli potentials first appeared in @xcite .",
    "the solution of the lee in the rw gauge is then given in the form @xmath70\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is a bilinear differential operator acting on @xmath72 and the spherical harmonics @xmath73 .",
    "note that , since focus is on non - stationary modes , only @xmath66 enter this formulation .",
    "the non - stationary solution space of the lee is thus parametrized by the infinite set of scalar fields @xmath72 that enter the series ( [ dec ] ) through ( [ rws ] ) .",
    "+ every notion of gravitational linear stability of the schwarzschild black hole prior to @xcite was concerned with the behavior of the potentials @xmath72 of isolated @xmath49 modes ( we call this `` modal linear stability '' ) . in particular :    * in @xcite it was shown that separable solutions @xmath74 that do not diverge as @xmath75 require @xmath76 , ruling out exponentially growing solutions in the odd sector . * in @xcite",
    "it was shown that separable solutions @xmath77 that do not diverge as @xmath75 require @xmath76 , ruling out exponentially growing solutions in the even sector . * in @xcite it was shown that , for large @xmath78 and fixed @xmath40 , @xmath79 decays as @xmath80 ( an effect known as `` price tails '' ) . * in @xcite ,",
    "the conserved energy @xmath81 f dr\\ ] ] was used to rule out uniform exponential growth in time . * also in @xcite",
    ", a point wise bound on the rw and zerilli potentials was found in the form @xmath82 are given in terms of the initial data @xmath83    to understand the limitations of these results it is important to keep in mind that the @xmath84 are an infinite set of potentials defined on the @xmath85 orbit space @xmath86 , whose first and second order derivatives @xmath84 enter the terms in the series ( [ dec ] ) through ( [ rws ] ) , together with first and second derivatives of the spherical harmonics .",
    "two extra derivatives are required to calculate the perturbed riemann tensor , as a first step to measure the effects of the perturbation on the curvature .",
    "thus , the relation of the potentials @xmath72 to geometrically meaningful quantities is remote , and the usefulness of the bounds ( [ modal - b ] ) to measure the strength of the perturbation is far from obvious .",
    "+ the motivation of the nonmodal approach can be better understood if we put in perspective the progress made in @xcite , equation ( [ modal - b ] ) . the fact that the two dimensional wave equations ( [ rwe ] ) and ( [ ze ] ) can be solved by separating variables ( @xmath87 ) had previous works on linear stability focus on showing that @xmath88 must be real , a limited notion of stability that does not even rule out , e.g. , linear @xmath78 growth @xcite . to obtain the type of bounds ( [ modal - b ] ) one must `` undo '' the separation of variables and reconsider the original equations ( [ rwe ] ) and ( [ ze ] ) , as this allows to work out results that are valid for generic , non separable solutions .",
    "the idea behind the non modal stability concept introduced in this paper , is to go one step further and `` undo '' the separation of the @xmath89 variables that antecedes the reduction of the lee to ( [ rwe ] ) and ( [ ze ] ) , in order to get bounds for truly four dimensional quantities .",
    "when trying to make this idea more precise , one is immediately faced to the problem of _ which _ four dimensional quantity one should look at . if this quantity is to measure the strength of the perturbation , it should be a field related to the curvature change , and it should also be a _",
    "scalar _ field , since there is no natural norm for a tensor field in a lorentzian background .",
    "if this scalar field does not obey a four dimensional wave equation ( or some partial differential equation ) , we do not have a clear tool to place bounds on it .",
    "thus , we are naturally led to the question of the existence of scalar fields made from perturbed css that , as a consequence of the lee , obey some wave - like equation .",
    "this is the problem we address in this paper .",
    "the name _ nonmodal stability _ is borrowed from fluid mechanics , where the limitations of the normal mode analysis were realized some thirty years ago in experiments involving wall bounded shear flows @xcite . in that problem , the linearized navier - stokes operator is non normal , so their eigenfunctions are non orthogonal and , as a consequence , even if they individually decay as @xmath90 , a condition that assures large @xmath78 stability , there may be important transient growths @xcite .",
    "take , e.g. , the following simple example ( from @xcite , section 2.3 and figure 2 ) of a system of two degrees of freedoms : @xmath91 obeying the equation @xmath92 , with @xmath93 \\neq 0 $ ] a matrix with ( non orthogonal ! ) eigenvectors @xmath94 , say , @xmath95 consider the case @xmath96 .",
    "note that , although @xmath97 , that is , normal modes decay exponentially , if @xmath98 , then @xmath99 reaches a maximum norm @xmath100 at a finite time before decaying to zero .",
    "+ for the odd sector of the lee , a four dimensional approach relating the metric perturbation with a scalar potential @xmath101 defined on @xmath102 ( instead of @xmath86 ) was found in @xcite , where it was noticed that the sum over @xmath49 of ( [ rws ] ) simplifies to @xmath103 = \\frac{r^2}{3 m } { } ^ * c_{{\\alpha}}{}^{{\\gamma}{\\delta}}{}_{{\\beta } } \\nabla_{{\\gamma } } \\nabla_{{\\delta } }   \\left ( r^3 \\phi \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath101 is a field assembled using spherical harmonics and the rw potentials : @xmath104 the odd sector lee equations ( [ rwe ] ) for @xmath105 combined to the spherical harmonic equations for the spherical harmonics @xmath106 , turn out to be equivalent to what we call the four dimensional regge - wheeler equation which , adding a cosmological constant , reads @xmath107 note however that @xmath101 is no more than the collection of @xmath108 s ,",
    "so its connection to geometrically relevant fields is loose . much more important",
    "is the fact , also proved in @xcite for @xmath6 , that the lee implies that the field @xmath109 _ also _ satisfies the [ 4drwe ] , as this is what allows us to place a point wise bound on @xmath110 .",
    "+ the even sector of the lee is more difficult to approach . is the simplicity of the rw potential ( [ rwp ] ) , with the obvious @xmath111 term , what suggested considering the field ( [ 4drf ] ) .",
    "the way @xmath50 appears in ( [ zp ] ) , instead , is a clear indication that there is no natural 4d interpretation of ( [ ze ] ) .",
    "is a map exchanging solutions of the [ rwe ] and [ ze ] equations , found by chandrasekhar @xcite , what ultimately allows us to also reduce the even non stationary lee equations to ( [ 4drwe ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the entire set of non stationary lee reduces to two fields satisfying equation ( [ 4drwe ] ) , as stated in theorem [ bij ] below .",
    "+ the purpose of this paper is twofold : ( i ) to extend the results in @xcite to schwarzschild black holes in cosmological backgrounds , and ( ii ) to explain in detail a number of technicalities omitted in @xcite due to the space limitations imposed by the letter format . for @xmath112",
    "we give a proof of non - modal stability .",
    "we leave aside the treatment of stability of the schwarzschild anti de sitter ( sads ) black hole , since the issue of non global hiperbolicity and ambiguous dynamics due to the conformal timelike boundary takes us away from the core of the subjects addressed here .",
    "we show however that there is ( at least ) one choice of robin boundary condition at the time - like boundary for which there is an instability , and we explicitly exhibit this instability and its effect on the background geometry . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this has not been informed before .",
    "a systematic study of the gravitational linear stability of sads black holes under different boundary conditions is to be found in @xcite .",
    "+ we have found that @xmath113 defined in ( [ gpm ] ) are appropriate variables to study the most general gravitational linear perturbations of schwarzschild ( a)ds black holes .",
    "the @xmath57 pieces of these fields encode the relevant information on the stationary modes , which are perturbations within the kerr family ( parametrized by mass @xmath39 and the angular momenta components ) , whereas the @xmath66 terms encode the dynamics .",
    "more precisely :    * @xmath5 contains no @xmath58 term , time independent @xmath59 terms proportional to the first order angular momenta components @xmath114 , and a time dependent @xmath115 piece obeying the 4drw equation .",
    "* @xmath4 contains no @xmath59 term , a time independent @xmath58 piece proportional to a mass shift @xmath116 , and a time dependent @xmath115 piece which , for @xmath112 , can be written in terms of fields obeying the 4drw equation .",
    "once the appropriate set of perturbation fields @xmath113 is given , and their relation to the 4drw equation established for @xmath112 , we may adapt to the 4drw equation the techniques used to prove boundedness of solutions of the scalar wave equation , in order to analyze the behavior of the @xmath1 fields . as an example , the result of kay and wald @xcite was used in @xcite to prove ( [ bounds1 ] ) in the schwarzschild case , and is adapted here to prove that ( [ bounds1 ] ) holds also for positive @xmath0 .",
    "we can go further and take advantage of the growing literature on decay of solutions of the scalar wave equation on s(a)ds backgrounds , as many of these results are expected to hold also for ( [ 4drwe ] ) .",
    "specific time decay results for the 4drw equation , somewhat expected from price s result @xcite , can be found in @xcite ( see also the recent preprint @xcite ) .",
    "putting together the bijection ( [ i m ] ) , the above description of the stationary ( @xmath57 ) and dynamic ( @xmath66 ) pieces of @xmath1 , and the time decay results , the following picture emerges for a perturbed schwarzschild ( sds ) black hole : a generic perturbation contains a mass shift , infinitesimal angular momenta @xmath117 and dynamical degrees of freedom ; at large times the dynamical degrees of freedom decay and what is left is a linearized kerr ( kerr ds ) black hole around the background schwarzschild ( sds ) solution .",
    "+ through the paper , calculations are carried leaving @xmath0 unspecified whenever possible , and specializing when necessary . among the many current treatments of linear perturbations of spherically symmetric spacetimes , we have made heavy use of the excellent paper @xcite , which we found particularly well suited to our approach .",

    "we will furthermore assume that @xmath131 tensor fields _ introduced _ with a lower @xmath51 index ( say @xmath132 ) and _ then shown with an upper @xmath51 index _ are assumed to have been acted upon _ with the unit @xmath51 metric inverse @xmath133 _ , ( i.e. , @xmath134 ) , and similarly for upper @xmath51 indexes moving down .",

    "the picture that emerges from these considerations is that , for a generic perturbation , the black hole ends up settling into a slowly rotating kerr ( kerr ds ) black hole . to make statements like these more precise ,",
    "all we need is quantitative information on the decay of solutions of the 4drw equation .",
    "this is so because @xmath791 _ is _ a solution of this equation , and @xmath4 can be written entirely in terms of solutions of the 4drw equation ( see equation ( [ g++ ] ) ) .",
    "alternatively , in view of theorem [ bij ] , there is a bijection between solutions of the lee and a set containing the constants @xmath792 and two fields @xmath579 that obey the 4drw equation .",
    "the perturbed metric is linearized kerr ( kerr de sitter ) if @xmath793 , which is the limit approached at large @xmath78 .",
    "quantitative results for the decay in time of solutions of the 4drw equation can be found in @xcite , @xcite and more recently in @xcite ( in this last reference , as statements on a symmetric tensor field made out of two scalar fields obeying ( [ 4drwe ] ) ) .",
    "+      a natural question that arises from our results is : can we forget altogether metric perturbations and restrict ourselves to the study of the 4drw equation ?",
    "the answer to this question is in the affirmative ( theorem [ bij ] and equations ( [ qdt ] ) and ( [ g++ ] ) ) , although some technical issues should be mentioned if one intends to study perturbations using only the @xmath1 or similar perturbed curvature fields .",
    "one is related to the possibility of evolving perturbations from initial @xmath1 data .",
    "since @xmath791 obeys the 4drw equation , initial data ( e.g. , @xmath794 and @xmath5 restricted to a @xmath795constant hypersurface ) gives @xmath5 and , by expanding in spherical harmonics , the metric perturbation in the rw gauge uniquely related to it .",
    "this does not happen , however , with @xmath4 in the even sector . since the operator @xmath796 in ( [ g+ ] ) has a non trivial kernel , and @xmath4",

    "the reason why @xmath4 does not obey a wave equation is , of course , that is made out of the perturbation of curvature scalars involving both the riemann tensor _ and its covariant derivative _ ; the possibility of constructing a gauge invariant curvature scalar field for the even sector that does not use derivatives of the riemann tensor was ruled out in @xcite .",
    "+ we should mention , however , two alternatives to the use of @xmath4 ( or similar fields involving css ) .",
    "one is using the potentials @xmath579 in theorem [ bij ] : perturbations are entirely characterized by @xmath792 ( stationary perturbations ) and the fields @xmath579 obeying the 4drw equation ( dynamical perturbations ) .",
    "this shows that we can do without the zerilli equation and that the lee does reduce to the 4drw equation .",
    "the other possibility to avoid scalar fields involving higher metric derivatives ( such as @xmath800 in @xmath4 , equation ( [ gp ] ) ) , is constructing gauge invariant combinations made out of perturbed curvature scalars _ and _ the metric perturbation .",
    "we close this section by exhibiting an example of such a construction : if we calculate the ( gauge dependent ) scalar field @xmath801 ( see ( [ curvaturescalars ] ) ) in the rw gauge , we find that @xmath802 thus @xmath803 also satisfies the 4drw equation ! we might think of using @xmath801 to measure the strength of even perturbations , but this field is gauge dependent due to the fact that @xmath804 for the background schwarzschild or s(a)ds black hole . under the gauge transformation ( [ gt ] ) , @xmath805 this suggests searching for a gauge invariant field @xmath806 that agrees with @xmath801 in the rw gauge .",
    "if we compare ( [ qp1 ] ) with equation ( [ gauge+ ] ) , we find the following solution : @xmath807 since this gauge invariant field _ reduces in the rw gauge to _",
    "@xmath808 , and the @xmath689 are gauge invariant , @xmath809 note that the dynamical @xmath66 piece of @xmath810 satisfies the 4drw equation , which gives @xmath806 an advantage over @xmath4 : it is possible to obtain @xmath806 from the initial datum @xmath811 .",
    "once this is done , the corresponding metric perturbation in the rw gauge can be obtained by expanding @xmath806 in spherical harmonics , which gives us @xmath116 and the @xmath812 and then applying lemma [ lema ] to recover the zerilli fields @xmath689 .",
