    "placebo effects have draw a lot of interest and debate in medicine@xcite .",
    "they can be viewed as a simulation of an active therapy within a psychosocial context@xcite .",
    "research in neurobiology has shown that placebo responses are accompanied by actual alterations in neural activity within brain regions involved in emotional regulation@xcite . hence , rather than inducing a simple bias in response",
    ", placebos can induce actual biological effects and improve clinical outcomes . among the cognitive and emotional factors that have been proposed to contribute to placebo effects ,",
    "the interaction between the desire for symptom change and the expected symptom intensity has been proposed as a key component giving raise to placebo effects@xcite . in the psychology literature , this interaction is known as the desire - expectation model of emotions@xcite , which postulates that ratings of positive and negative emotional feelings are predicted by multiplicative interactions between ratings of desire and expectation .",
    "a number of experimental studies of placebo analgesia@xcite have corroborated the role of the desire - expectation model as a trigger of placebo effects .",
    "these findings have important implications for both clinical practice and clinical trials . on one hand",
    ", clinicians should harness the placebo effect to improve the clinical outcome of their patients ( by managing expectations and desires through ethical use of suggestions and optimum caregiver - patient interactions)@xcite . on the other hand , assessment of expectation and desire levels",
    "is also important in clinical trials since placebo effects might strongly influence the results of a study . in unblinded trials",
    ", it is widely recognized that the overall effect attributed to a treatment might actually correspond to a combination of treatment and placebo effects . however",
    ", placebo effects might still play a role in blinded trials as well@xcite .",
    "for instance , blinded studies evaluating the effectiveness of acupuncture@xcite and of implantation of human embryonic dopamine neurons into the brains of persons with severe parkinson disease@xcite have shown that perceived treatment ( or the treatment the participants thought they had received ) can have stronger effects than the treatment actually received by the participants .",
    "these findings illustrate the relevance of measuring expectation , desire , and emotional levels in order to assess the contribution of placebo effects , and suggest that it is important to adjust for these variables when estimating treatment effects and interpreting the results of clinical trials@xcite .",
    "however , because it is generally impossible to rule out the presence of unmeasured confounders , simply measuring and adjusting for variables associated with placebo effects might not be enough to ensure a reliable estimation of the treatment effect .",
    "for instance , estimation based on regression models adjusting for the placebo related measurements still leads to biased estimates of the treatment effect , unless all confounders influencing the outcome variable enter the regression model .",
    "here we present a statistical approach to disentangle treatment and placebo effects using instrumental variables@xcite in randomized experiments .",
    "an instrumental variable ( iv ) is statistically independent from any unmeasured confounders , but is associated with the treatment variable and with the outcome variable ( via its influence on the treatment variable alone ) .",
    "use of ivs in randomized experiments allows the consistent estimation of treatment effects without the need to explicitly model the confounders ( the technique even accounts for confounders the researcher is unaware about ) .",
    "our proposed method requires the ability to assess variables associated with placebo effects ( e.g. , levels of expectancy , desire , and emotion ) , and uses randomization to separately manipulate a pair of variables .",
    "the first , corresponds to a psychological encouragement variable aiming to increase the desire for improved symptoms .",
    "the study participants are randomized according to whether they receive the psychological encouragement or not .",
    "this  psychological treatment \"",
    "iv allows the consistent estimation of the placebo effect on the outcome in the presence of confounders .",
    "the second , corresponds to a treatment assignment variable representing the random assignment of participants to active treatment or control therapy groups .",
    "it allows the estimation of the treatment effect on the outcome , after adjustment for the placebo effect .",
    "mechanistically , the approach corresponds to a two - step procedure , which first estimates the contribution of the placebo effect on the outcome , and then the effect of the treatment on the residuals of the outcome variable after the contribution of the placebo effect has been removed .",
    "a graphical representation of the causal model underlying our approach is given in figure [ fig : dags]a . circled and un - circled nodes represent observed and unobserved variables , respectively .",
    "arrows represent the causal influence of a variable on another , with the influence of unmeasured confounders shown as dotted arrows .",
    "the binary variable @xmath0 represents the randomized treatment assigned to the participant ( 1 if participant is assigned to the active treatment group , and 0 if assigned to the control group ) , while @xmath1 represents the treatment actually received by the study participant ( 1 if the participant receives the active treatment , and 0 otherwise ) .",
    "it is important to model both assigned and received treatment variables since participants wo nt necessarily subscribe to their assigned treatment , and the experiment might suffer from imperfect compliance .",

    "being able to control type i error rates at the exact nominal level is a desirable statistical property , as it means that the test is neither conservative nor liberal .",
    "figure [ fig : simbetablinded ] presents the results for the treatment effect tests in the blinded setting .",

    "figure [ fig : simbetaunblinded ] presents the results for the unblinded case .",
    "all panels show slightly inflated errors for the two - step iv estimator ( blue ) .",

    ", we evaluated an additional iv estimator , where the true placebo effect was used in the computation of the residuals ( i.e. , we estimated @xmath34 by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 , instead of @xmath28 , where @xmath29 ) .",
    "results based on this estimator ( dark - orange ) show that , indeed , adjustment by the true placebo effect leads to error rates controlled at the nominal level .",
    "the regression approach ( brown ) shows again highly inflated errors in the presence of confounders ( panels a and b ) .",
    "panels a and c show well controlled errors for the non - adjusted iv estimator ( red ) in the absence of placebo effects as , in this case , there are no paths from @xmath1 to @xmath4 , and the association between @xmath1 and @xmath4 induced by confounders is accounted by the iv estimator .",
    "panels b and d , on the other hand , show highly inflated error rates in the presence of placebo effects since , in this case , @xmath1 can influence @xmath4 through the paths mediated by @xmath13 .",
    "these observations suggest that , in practice , when analyzing the results of unblinded trials , we should first test for the existence of placebo effect , and then use the two - step iv estimator if @xmath30 is rejected , and the non - adjusted one if @xmath30 is accepted .",
    "while this strategy can decrease the chance of the two - step approach making a type i error in the absence of placebo effects , the estimator is still unable to avoid slightly inflated errors produced in the presence of placebo effects .",
    "we point out , however , that the two - step procedure still represents a strong improvement over the alternative approach of not adjusting for placebo effects in the presence of confounders ( compare the red and blue curves in panel b of figure [ fig : simbetaunblinded ] ) .    for completeness",
    ", we also report an evaluation of the empirical power ( figures [ fig : powerpsi ] , [ fig : powerbetablinded ] , and [ fig : powerbetaunblinded ] ) .",
    "we point out , however , that power results are more sensitive to the choice of parameter values employed in the generation of the simulated data ( e.g. , sample size , the strength of treatment , placebo and confounding effects , and etc ) , than the type i error rates . in any case , these empirical power results , still serve to illustrate some general patterns .",
    "for instance , the regression tests tended to show considerably stronger power than the iv approaches in the presence of confounders ( compare the brown and blue curves in panels a and b of figures [ fig : powerbetablinded ] and [ fig : powerbetaunblinded ] ) .",
    "we point out , however , that this increased power is likely an artifact of the biased estimates of @xmath34 outputted by the regression approach .",
    "figure [ fig : deltabeta ] , illustrates how the regression estimates tended to show larger bias than the estimates generated by the iv estimators ( note the heavier tails of the brown density , in both blinded and unblinded cases ) .",
    "in other words , the increased power is likely a consequence of the overestimation of the treatment effect by the regression approach , which mistakenly interprets the association between treatment and outcome caused by unmeasured confounders as a stronger influence of the treatment on the outcome .",
    "at least for the parameter ranges adopted in our simulations , we observed good empirical power of the iv approach to detect placebo effects , even when the correlation between psychological encouragement and emotional level was relatively low ( figure [ fig : stratifiedpower]a ) .",
    "this suggests that the psychological encouragement treatment does not need to be highly effective in manipulating the emotional levels , in order for the approach to work well in practice .",
    "similarly , figure [ fig : stratifiedpower]b shows good empirical power of the two - step iv approach to detect treatment effects when the correlation between the assigned and received treatment is moderate , suggesting that the proposed approach does not require high levels of compliance in order to perform well .",
    "a natural question , at this point , is whether larger sample sizes ( and , hence , more precise estimates of @xmath37 ) would be able to decrease the slightly inflated error rates produced by the two - step estimator in unblinded trials .",
    "figure [ sfig : suppleconsitency ] presents additional simulation experiments showing that , while the empirical power and the @xmath37 and @xmath38 estimates are greatly improved by larger sample sizes , the type i error rates stay roughly the same ( likely because larger sample sizes increase the ability of a test to detect small effects , since the randomization null distributions tend to be more concentrated around 0 , so that the improved @xmath37 estimates are counterbalanced by the increased propensity to detect small and spurious treatment effects ) .",
    "these results suggest that special care must be taken while interpreting the results of hypothesis tests in the unblinded case , even for large sample sizes . in any case , when the goal is estimation rather than testing , the consistency of the two - step estimator guarantees that the treatment estimates will converge to the true value as the sample size increases .",
    "this observation is particularly important in view of the current trend in the biomedical field , where researchers are shifting from relying exclusively in p - values and are paying more attention to parameter estimates and confidence intervals . to meet this latter need",
    ", we also describe in the methods how to generate confidence intervals ( cis ) for placebo and treatment effects by inverting randomization tests .",
    "figure [ fig : randconfint ] shows 95% cis for the placebo and treatment effects , from 3 simulated data sets of increasing sizes .",
    "the randomization cis inherit the statistical properties of the randomization tests , hence , the placebo effect cis ( and treatment effect cis from blinded trials ) are exact in the sense that a @xmath39% interval will contain the true parameter value @xmath39% of the time . note that while the treatment effect cis from unblinded trails wo nt be exact , they are still going to be centered around the estimated treatment effect , which will , nevertheless , converge to the true value as the sample size increases .",
    "clinical trials traditionally employ blinding to control the influence of placebo effects .",
    "it has being pointed out , however , that even blinded studies might be influenced by placebo effects , as the patients perceptions and beliefs about the treatment they think they received are able to trigger strong placebo effects@xcite . recently , a number of statistical approaches have been proposed to quantify the contributions of treatment and placebo effects to a clinical outcome@xcite .",
    "these approaches , nonetheless , are tailored to blinded trials , and leverage blinding assessment data to quantify the amount of unmasking taking place during the trial .",
    "our iv approach , on the other hand , allows the quantification of treatment and placebo effects not only in blinded , but also in unblinded trials .    the key idea underlying the iv approach ( what actually allows the consistent estimation of both treatment and placebo effects in the presence of unmeasured confounders ) , is the use of randomization to separately manipulate the treatment assignment and encouragement messages . in this sense ,",
    "the proposed approach is similar in spirit ( but not exactly equivalent ) to a randomized treatment - belief trial ( rtb)@xcite , where the treatment assignment is manipulated by randomization , whereas the belief is manipulated by varying the allocation ratio of participants assigned to control and treatment groups in a , necessarily , blinded trial .",
    "hence , our iv approach can be viewed as a more flexible type of rtb that is applicable to both blinded and unblinded studies , and might be easier to administer than a standard rtb , which requires the stratification of study participants over several arms with distinct treatment / control allocation ratios in order to be able to assess placebo effects .",
    "the proposed iv approach enjoys appealing statistical properties .",
    "the iv estimators are consistent , meaning that the estimates converge to the true values as sample size increases .",
    "the randomization tests for placebo effects are exact in both blinded and unblinded trails , whereas the treatment effect tests are exact in blinded trials , but slightly liberal in unblinded ones .",
    "furthermore , the confidence intervals obtained by inverting randomization tests inherit these appealing properties .",
    "an implicit assumption of the model in figure [ fig : dags]a is that the placebo effect is mediated exclusively by the interplay of desire , expectation , and emotion . while it is believed that the desire - expectation model plays a key role in the triggering of placebo effects , other mechanisms , such as conditioning , might also be at work@xcite . clearly , when this is the case , a treatment effect estimate , adjusted by the desire - expectation component alone , will still be biased ( although less biased than the estimate computed without accounting for it ) . in any case , if we are also able to assess and measure these additional mechanisms , then the same statistical framework can be used to obtain consistent estimates of treatment effects in the presence of confounders ( we only need additional ivs to manipulate the additional placebo related variables ) .",

    "it only requires the ability to assess expectation , desire , and emotion , as well as , the development of a psychological encouragement iv , capable of manipulating the level of desire of a study participant .",

    "implementation of the proposed iv approach in mobile health applications is also strait - forward . for instance , the psychological treatment could be delivered by encouragement messages popping up in the screen of a smartphone ( according to a randomized schedule , where every day the participant has an equal chance of receiving , or not , the encouragement message ) , and the measurement of the emotional and desire levels can be assessed by short electronic surveys / quentionnaires delivered by the participant s smartphone on a daily basis .",
    "we expect the proposed method to play an important role in these personalized medicine@xcite applications .",
    "finally , for both ( population - based ) clinical trials and personalized monitoring of treatment response , the instrument @xmath18 serves the double role of disentangling placebo from treatment effects , and increasing the desire for improved symptoms .",

    "while the manipulation of the expectation for symptom intensity could , in principle , be used to consistently estimate a placebo effect under the proposed approach ( i.e. , we could have an iv influencing @xmath10 instead of @xmath11 ) , the manipulation of expectation levels needs to be accompanied by the honest disclosure of the expected benefits of a treatment ( and , in some cases , might raise ethical issues)@xcite .",
    "manipulation of the desire for improved symptoms , on the other hand , provides an ethically defensible practice in the design of clinical trials and in the personalized monitoring of patients .",
    "we subscribe to the mechanism - based account of causation championed by pearl@xcite . in this framework ,",
    "the qualitative description of the assumptions regarding the causal relations between the variables involved in our proposed method , is encoded by the directed acyclic graph presented in figure [ fig : dags]a . assuming a linear relation between the outcome , @xmath4 , and the unobserved somatic and psychosomatic state variables , @xmath3 and @xmath7",

    "substituting equations ( [ eq : linearp ] ) and ( [ eq : linears ] ) into equation ( [ eq : linearyfull ] ) , we obtain the reduced outcome model , @xmath52 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : linearyreduced ] ) represents the outcome model in figure [ fig : dags]b .",

    "we point out , however , that the estimator obtained from the potential outcome approach is still identical to the estimator derived from the mechanism based approach , so that statistical inferences based on randomization tests are still the same , independent of the causality framework one is willing to adopt .      adopting a method of moments approach",

    "we point out , however , that if expectation and desire measurements are also available , then we can evaluate the validity of the desire - expectation model for the data at hand by checking whether the @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 variables are able to predict the @xmath13 measurements .",
    "we can also assess the effectiveness of the psychological treatment in influencing desire for better symptoms by estimating @xmath72 .",
    "direct estimation of the treatment effect in equation ( [ eq : treatmenteffect ] ) using an iv estimator is unfeasible , as it would involve the unmeasured quantities @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain a consistent estimator of the treatment effect , we adopt a two - step approach where we first estimate @xmath74 as @xmath75 , for @xmath76 , and then estimate @xmath34 using , @xmath77    note that the iv estimators in equations ( [ eq : placeboivestimator ] ) and ( [ eq : treatmentivestimator ] ) can produce highly inflated estimates when @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "hence , in practice , it is important to check the assumptions that psychological encouragement influences the emotion levels , and that the compliance between assigned and received treatments is not negligible .",
    "we implemented randomization tests@xcite for testing the presence of a placebo effect ( @xmath30 versus @xmath80 ) , and of a treatment effect ( @xmath31 versus @xmath81 ) .",
    "the randomization null distribution for the placebo effect is generated by evaluating the statistic @xmath37 in equation ( [ eq : placeboivestimator ] ) on a large number of shuffled versions of the data , where the @xmath82 measurements are shuffled relative to the @xmath83 measurements ( whose connection is kept intact in order to preserve the association between the @xmath18 and @xmath13 variables ) .",

    "these randomization tests are non - parametric procedures and do nt make any distributional assumptions about the data . however , because the identification of the causal effects assumes a linear relation between @xmath4 and @xmath1 and @xmath13 , the validity of the tests is still contingent on this assumption .      here",
    "we describe how to build confidence intervals for placebo and treatment effects using the p - values from randomization tests@xcite . throughout this section",
    "we use @xmath85 to represent either the placebo effect , @xmath26 , or the treatment effect , @xmath34 .",

    "exploring the correspondence between confidence intervals and hypothesis tests , we obtain a @xmath89% confidence interval ( ci ) for @xmath85 by searching for a lower bound value , @xmath90 , such that @xmath91 is rejected in favor of @xmath92 at a significance @xmath93 , and by searching for an upper bound value , @xmath94 , such that @xmath95 is rejected in favor of @xmath96 at the same significance level@xcite .",
