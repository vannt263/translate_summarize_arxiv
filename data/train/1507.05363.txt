    "in a broadband wireless communication system , channel state information ( csi ) is required at the receiver due to the fact that the multipath fading channel distorts the received signals , especially when the channel is dynamically changing .",
    "hence , accurate channel estimation and tracking become an important problem for communication over a dynamic wireless channel @xcite .",
    "various linear channel estimation methods with low computational complexity have been proposed @xcite , but their performance is often not robust enough to meet the requirement of communication systems with high rate and high mobility .",
    "recently , a lot of physical channel measurements have verified that wireless channels exhibit sparsity , i.e. , the dimension of a wireless channel may be large , but the number of active taps with significant power is usually small , especially in a broadband wireless communication system @xcite . by exploiting this channel sparsity , many nonlinear channel estimation methods based on classical compressive sensing ( cs ) algorithms have been proposed to improve the estimation performance , such as orthogonal matching pursuit ( omp ) , compressive sampling matching pursuit ( cosamp ) , and subspace pursuit ( sp ) @xcite-@xcite . compared with the conventional linear methods , cs - based channel estimation methods are able to achieve improved accuracy with reduced training resources @xcite .",
    "further studies have uncovered additional channel characteristics , e.g. , the temporal correlations of practical wireless channels : path delays have been shown to change slowly over time , while path gains evolve faster @xcite . however , the cs - based channel estimation methods ignore these temporal correlations of dynamic sparse channels and have to estimate them independently . by taking the temporal correlation into account , the adaptive simultaneous omp ( a - somp ) algorithm has been proposed in @xcite to obtain simultaneous multi - channel estimates based on the assumption that the dynamic channel estimates in several consecutive time slots share the same path delay set .",
    "however , the path delays of a dynamic sparse channel will change over time , or even there maybe some mutations , so the assumption in @xcite is not always true in practice .",
    "another attractive solution for tracking a dynamic sparse channel is the hierarchical bayesian kalman ( hb - kalman ) filter based on bayesian cs ( bcs ) @xcite , whereby the iterative re - estimation of the posterior covariance @xcite is used to achieve accurate channel estimation when sudden changes happen to the dynamic sparse channel , but it suffers from slow tracking speed and high computational complexity . in this paper , we propose a dynamic cs algorithm called differential orthogonal matching pursuit ( d - omp ) based on the standard omp algorithm to track a dynamic sparse channel with fast tracking speed and low computational complexity . by exploiting the temporal correlation of a dynamic sparse channel , the proposed d - omp algorithm only needs to detect the small variation of the dynamic sparse channel in a sequential way .",
    "furthermore , an adaptive threshold based on the statistical analysis of the  equivalent \" noise is proposed to accurately distinguish true , i.e. , non - zero channel taps with low power from thermal noise .",
    "this is essentially different from the standard omp algorithm in which the incorrect channel taps chosen in one iteration will never be removed , which finally leads to performance degradation .",
    "the performance analysis indicates that a non - zero channel tap can be detected with a high probability , while the noise in the estimate can be removed almost completely .",
    "numerical simulations show that the proposed d - omp algorithm can track dynamic channels faster and achieve more accurate channel estimates than other tracking algorithms .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the system model of dynamic sparse channels is described in section ii .",
    "section iii addresses the proposed d - omp algorithm , together with the threshold based on noise statistics .",
    "section iv presents the performance analysis , and simulation results are provided in section v. finally , conclusions are drawn in section vi .",

    "the measurement matrix @xmath23 of size @xmath24 is a toeplitz matrix determined by the training sequence @xmath25^t$ ] in the time or frequency domain , e.g. , the well known pseudo noise ( pn ) sequence used in cdma systems @xcite .",

    "since the training sequence is usually designed in a random way , i.e. , @xmath27 , we can obtain that @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 denotes the element of the matrix @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , based on this gaussian assumption , the columns of the @xmath11 matrix are semi - orthogonal , i.e. , @xmath31 .",
    "the temporal correlations of practical wireless channels have been verified through analysis and experiments , even when the channels are varying fast @xcite .",
    "[ dynamic_sparse_channel ] illustrates the time - domain impulse response of the dynamic rayleigh fading vehicular b channel with a velocity of 120 km / h in three consecutive time slots @xcite .",
    "it is clear that path delays of such dynamic sparse channels change slowly , while path gains evolve faster . in order to characterize the temporal correlations of a dynamic sparse channel",
    ", we adopt a probabilistic signal model with two time series vectors @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where the binary vector @xmath34^t$ ] is used to describe the temporal evolution of the channel paths , while the complex - valued vector @xmath35^t$ ] characterizes the temporal variation of the path gains .",

    "the probabilities @xmath52 and @xmath53 are usually small to model the slow changing of the path delays , while @xmath54 changes in each time slot to model the faster changing of the path gains .",

    "in this section , the proposed d - omp algorithm is explained in detail . then the threshold used in the algorithm is derived based on noise statistics .",
    "we propose the d - omp algorithm to track a dynamic sparse channel , which obtains the final estimates in a sequential way by updating the small variation of the dynamic sparse channel .",
    "the key idea of the proposed d - omp algorithm is that , the major information of the channel in the current time slot can be obtained from the estimation results in previous time slots due to the temporal correlations of the dynamic sparse channel , and then the small variation of the channel can be estimated with low complexity to refine the final estimate result .",
    "this is essentially different from the standard omp algorithm which ignores any temporal correlation of the channel taps @xcite .",

    "the pseudocode of the proposed d - omp algorithm is provided in algorithm 1 , and each loop is comprised of the following three parts :      firstly , we obtain the incremental observations @xmath69 by subtracting @xmath70 from @xmath71 in step 4 , where @xmath72 denotes the estimate of @xmath73 . here",
    "we use @xmath70 instead of @xmath74 to avoid the impact of the noise @xmath75 .",
    "different from the way used in the standard omp algorithm which iteratively detects the candidate supports by selecting the element that correlates best with the residual signal @xcite , here we only detect the incremental support @xmath76 in step 5 , which is able to acquire the appearing channel tap as @xmath77 .",
    "then , the temporary estimate of the path delays set @xmath78 is obtained by merging @xmath79 which contains the persistent channel taps , i.e. , @xmath80 , and @xmath76 which contains the appearing channel tap .",
    "step 7 aims to update the channel estimate based on the temporary estimate of the path delays set @xmath78 .",
    "intuitively , the variation of the channel estimate is comprised of three parts : a ) the appearing channel tap @xmath40 when @xmath77 ; b ) the disappearing channel tap @xmath81 when @xmath82 ; c ) the smooth variation of the path gains @xmath83 .",
    "the minimization problem in step 7 corresponds to the main computational burden of the d - omp algorithm , which can be realized by the standard least - squares ( ls ) technique with low complexity @xcite .",
    "when a tap @xmath84 disappears as @xmath85 , the estimated tap in the previous @xmath86th time slot will still remain in the estimated path delay set of the current time slot since @xmath63 .",
    "the path gain of this disappearing channel tap @xmath87 will be small .",
    "therefore , we propose a threshold @xmath57 to judge whether the nonzero elements in @xmath88 are non - zero channel taps or noise in step 8 . after removing the disappearing channel taps ,",
    "the final channel estimate can be obtained in step 9 .    unlike the standard omp algorithm which needs to solve the minimization problem for many times according to the sparsity level of the wireless channel @xcite , the proposed d - omp algorithm only needs to solve the minimization problem once , so the computational complexity can be dramatically reduced .",
    "furthermore , unlike the hard threshold @xcite or the rough criterion @xcite , we rely on the noise analysis to select the threshold @xmath57 , which will be derived in the following subsection .      here",
    "we consider a single time slot ( we omit the time slot superscript @xmath39 ) , and rewrite ( [ y = phih+n ] ) as @xmath89 where @xmath90 denotes the pseudoinverse of @xmath11 . generally , linear channel estimation methods are designed to directly approach @xmath91 , so their performance is limited by the contamination of the  equivalent \" noise @xmath92 in ( 4 ) .",
    "the advantage of cs - based nonlinear estimation methods is that they reconstruct the sparse channel @xmath9 and avoid part of the interference caused by the  equivalent \" noise @xmath93 . since the basic idea of the greedy cs methods is to iteratively search the channel taps from the strongest one to the weakest one @xcite , @xcite , it is difficult for these algorithms to judge whether the searched taps are true , i.e. , non - zero channel taps or noise , when they are weak .    in order to further reduce the interference caused by @xmath93 under the cs framework , we design the threshold @xmath57 based on the statistical properties of the noise @xmath93 for the proposed d - omp algorithm to separate non - zero channel taps from noise as much as possible . according to ( [ y = phi(h+n ) ] ) , we have @xmath92 .",
    "the mean of the vector @xmath93 can be easily obtained as @xmath94 due to the fact that the measurement matrix @xmath11 and the noise vector @xmath95 are independent .",
    "then , the covariance of the elements in equivalent noise @xmath93 can be derived as @xmath96 where @xmath97 denotes the @xmath38th row of the matrix @xmath98 and @xmath99 is the @xmath100th element of @xmath97 .",
    "furthermore , we have @xmath101 where we use @xmath102 to approximate @xmath103 due to the randomness of the matrix @xmath11 . then we can obtain the variance of @xmath104 as @xmath105 finally , the statistical properties of the elements in @xmath93 can be represented as @xmath106 @xmath107    with the help of the statistical properties of the noise vector @xmath93 , the threshold @xmath57 can be selected as @xmath108 where the variance @xmath109 of the noise vector @xmath95 can be usually obtained at the receiver @xcite .",
    "the coefficient @xmath110 can be set as @xmath111 so that the strength of the noise element @xmath112 will be smaller than @xmath57 with high probability of @xmath113 , based on the assumed gaussian distribution .",
    "in section iii - b , the proposed threshold @xmath114 is used to remove the disappearing channel taps from the channel estimate result with high probability . on the other hand ,",
    "as the proposed scheme may also remove a persistent channel tap by mistake , the correct detection probability of the persistent tap for the scheme is also important to guarantee its performance in practice , which will be analyzed below .",
    "firstly , the snr @xmath115 at the receiver can be obtained @xcite and represented as @xmath116 where @xmath117 denotes the sparsity level of the dynamic sparse channel .",
    "thus , the threshold @xmath57 can be obtained as @xmath118    after the threshold has been obtained , we can calculate the detection probability of a persistent channel tap as @xmath119 , which can be derived by using the normal gaussian distribution probability function @xmath120 as @xmath121 for example , in a typical wireless communication system with @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 db , the probability of a persistent tap being larger than @xmath57 is about @xmath126 .      as the d - omp algorithm is proposed to track a dynamic channel ,",

    "when there is an appearing channel tap from time slot @xmath86 to @xmath128 ( for simplicity , we assume other channel taps stay unchanged , i.e. , @xmath129 ) , the step 4 in algorithm 1 can be rewritten as @xmath130 where @xmath131 ( @xmath132 ) denotes the appearing channel tap at the time index @xmath38 during the @xmath39th time slot of the dynamic sparse channel .    according to the detection rule in step 5 of algorithm 1",
    ", the appearing channel tap @xmath131 is successfully detected if and only if @xmath133 where @xmath134 can be derived as @xmath135 then @xmath136 can be similarly derived as @xmath137 using ( [ igeqj ] ) , we can obtain the condition under which the appearing channel tap @xmath131 is successfully detected : latexmath:[\\[\\label{h_condition }    which means the path gain of the appearing channel tap should be larger than a minimum value .",
    "intuitively , the idea behind the incremental support detection of the proposed d - omp algorithm is to find the elements @xmath76 that correlate best with the incremental observations @xmath69 , but the previously detected support @xmath79 will not be considered . due to the fact that the appearing channel tap can be detected immediately",
    "if it is larger than a certain value derived in ( [ h_condition ] ) , while the posterior covariance matrix of the hb - kalman method @xcite needs several time slots to converge , the condition of incremental support detection of the proposed d - omp algorithm is much easier to satisfy than that of the hb - kalman method .",
    "the computational complexity of the proposed d - omp algorithm in terms of the required number of complex multiplications includes the following three parts :    1 .   in the incremental detection part , the complexity is @xmath139 for the calculation of @xmath70 and @xmath140 .",
