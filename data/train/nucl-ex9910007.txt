    "it is generally assumed that quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is capable of describing the structure and spectroscopy of baryons and mesons .",
    "in addition , a number of models based on qcd predict other types of quark and gluonic systems such as pure gluonic states ( glueballs ) , hybrids ( q@xmath2 g ) , four quark di - mesons ( qq@xmath3 , q@xmath2q@xmath2 ) @xcite , penta - quark states ( qqqq@xmath2 ) , six quark dibaryons @xcite , strangelets , and for large systems several fm in size at sufficiently high temperature and/or net baryon density , the color - deconfined quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "extensive experimental searches have been made for all these systems .",
    "in particular , many experiments ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) have searched for a stable ( at least to strong decay ) , doubly - strange flavor - singlet dibaryon ( h@xmath4 ) of the six quark su(3)-flavor [ su(3)@xmath5 multiplets @xcite .",
    "this hypercharge ( @xmath6 ) = 0 dibaryon was predicted by jaffe @xcite to be stable against strong decay , but not to weak decay ; hence the experiments generally searched for characteristic weak decay topologies .",
    "so far , no conclusive evidence for a bound h@xmath4 has been presented @xcite . however , the h@xmath4 mass may be larger than @xmath7 , the @xmath0 strong decay threshold @xcite . in this case",
    "the h@xmath4 could be a strong interaction resonance .",
    "if the resonance lies only a few mev above @xmath8 , then it may be possible to see experimental evidence for its existence , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 mesons are 32.1 , 5.8 , 7.1 and 35.0  mev , respectively , above their strong decay thresholds and have total widths of 4.4 , @xmath120.13 , @xmath122.1 and @xmath122.3  mev , respectively .",
    "the latter three quantities represent upper limits at the 90% confidence level . ]",
    "in addition , it is important to point out that several other doubly - strange dibaryon states occur in the su(3)@xmath13 multiplets which do not directly strong decay to @xmath0 and which may also appear as resonances in the @xmath0 and @xmath14 systems .",
    "experimental searches for a stable h@xmath4 have attempted to create and observe the h@xmath4 through : ( 1 ) double - strangeness - exchange reactions , such as @xmath15 , @xmath16 ; ( 2 ) @xmath17 capture @xcite on nuclear targets with @xmath18 ; and ( 3 ) proton + nucleus @xcite or nucleus + nucleus collisions where the h@xmath4 production mechanism could proceed via multi - hyperon production followed by coalescence @xcite .",

    ". however , the data are too coarsely binned and lack sufficient statistics to be relevant for the type of experimental search proposed here . on the other hand ,",

    "the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) facility at the brookhaven national laboratory , together with four new detectors , is beginning a program of research whose primary goal is to produce a quark - gluon plasma and study its properties .",
    "it is noteworthy that a color - deconfined qgp could enhance significantly the production of h@xmath4 dibaryons compared to the production expected from a hot hadronic gas @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the largest component of the six quark dibaryon wave function consists of a color - singlet superposition of color - octet - octet components @xcite : @xmath22 here , @xmath23 represents the color - octet - octet components , and @xmath24 denotes a summation of states composed of two physical baryons .",
    "enhanced dibaryon production can occur by way of fusion of color - octet clusters within the deconfined plasma @xcite .",
    "if evidence for dibaryon resonances is observed in the data from rhic collisions , then analyses of such data would provide an independent basis for studying the qgp .    in this work",
