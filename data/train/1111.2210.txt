    "the study of dirac points , i.e. the contact points between different energy bands with an approximate linear dispersion relation , has become a major issue since the experimental breakthrough in graphene - based electronics @xcite .",
    "indeed , the low - energy electronic properties of graphene are governed by a pseudo - relativistic 2d dirac equation for massless fermions situated at the @xmath0 and @xmath1 corners of the brillouin zone @xcite .",
    "the dirac points are topologically protected and a gap is opened only when the inversion symmetry of the lattice or the time - reversal symmetry are broken .    the possibility to generate topological phase transitions in graphene - like systems has recently attracted a great deal of attention . within a tight - binding description , an anisotropy in the nearest - neighbor hopping parameters",
    "makes the dirac points move away from the high - symmetry @xmath0 and @xmath1 points and , under appropriate conditions , merge at time - reversal invariant points in the first brillouin zone @xcite .",
    "most saliently , this merging of dirac points is associated with a topological phase transition between a semimetallic phase and a gapped band - insulating phase .",
    "an experimental investigation of the merging transition in graphene turns out to be problematic , since in order to appropriately modify the hopping parameters , an unphysically large strain needs to be applied to the graphene sheet @xcite .",
    "an alternative system for the study of such topological transitions is that of ultracold atoms trapped in a honeycomb optical lattice . since the seminal realization of the superfluid - mott - insulator transition in the bose - hubbard model , ultracold atoms in optical lattices",
    "have become promising systems to emulate condensed - matter physics .",
    "indeed , the lattice geometry , the dimensionality , the atomic species , as well as the interactions can be engineered with a high degree of precision .",
    "the more involved triangular and honeycomb geometries were recently realized experimentally and exotic correlated states of matter have been observed experimentally @xcite or predicted theoretically @xcite .",
    "the application of a time - periodic perturbation on the optical lattice introduces yet another parameter scale into the system .",
    "a periodic shaking of the optical lattice , up to the khz frequency range , has been implemented by placing one of the mirrors used to create the optical lattice on a piezoelectric material , such that the mirror can be moved back and forth in the direction of the beam @xcite .",
    "the floquet formalism shows that the hopping energy of the atoms in the shaken lattice is renormalized by a bessel function , as a function of the shaking frequency and amplitude , thus allowing both the magnitude and the sign of the hopping parameter to change .",

    ", we consider ultracold fermions trapped in a _ shaken _ honeycomb optical lattice . within the floquet formalism , we derive an effective hamiltonian that generalizes that of a graphene - like material under strain . in particular , we find that the alignment and merging of dirac points in momentum space are now accessible with ultracold fermions in the shaken optical lattice and the phase diagram consists of various phases of the corresponding solid - state system that are otherwise difficult to realize . furthermore , by taking into account a hubbard - like interaction for spinful fermions , we study the density profiles for the homogenous and the trapped gas within a hartree - fock theory .",
    "the outline of this paper is the following : in sec.[sec01a ] we introduce the time - dependent hamiltonian and in sec.[sec01b ] we derive the time - independent one , by applying the floquet formalism . in sec.[sec02 ]",

    "in this section , we derive a time - independent effective description for ultracold atoms trapped in a periodically shaken honeycomb optical lattice by utilizing a floquet theory . for simplicity , we focus on a system of single - component fermionic atoms and consider only single - particle terms in this section . the results from the floquet theory are valid for fermionic atoms with internal degrees of freedom as well as for bosonic atoms . in particular",

    "the system of ultracold fermionic atoms trapped in a 2d _ shaken _ honeycomb optical lattice can be described by the hamiltonian @xmath3 which consists of two distinct parts .",

    "the three vectors @xmath12 connect an @xmath10-lattice site with its three nearest - neighbor ( nn ) @xmath11-lattice sites and are given in terms of the distance @xmath13 between nn sites , where @xmath14 is the laser wave number ( see fig.[fig : lattice ] ) . here",
    ", @xmath15 characterize the energy gained in hopping to the nn and next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) sites , respectively , and @xmath16 is the on - site energy .",
    "we remark that the nnn hopping is taken into account because the nn hopping may be rendered vanishingly small in the effective time - independent description . in this regime , the nnn may become the dominant kinetic term . in a square lattice , where the potential is separable in independent @xmath17 and @xmath18 components ,",
    "the nnn hopping is identically zero @xcite .",

    "@xcite . as a consequence of the transformation to the co - moving frame",
    ", @xmath25 describes atoms of mass @xmath26 experiencing a position - dependent sinusoidal force .",
    "the unavoidable complexity that arises when dealing with a quantum many - body system out of equilibrium has recently motivated the development of new theoretical tools , for example time - dependent density matrix renormalization group @xcite , time - dependent dynamical mean field theory @xcite , and exact diagonalization @xcite",
    ".    however , for a periodically driven quantum system , the floquet theory offers a simplified description of the system , in the form of a time - independent effective hamiltonian , if the period @xmath27 is the shortest time scale in the problem @xcite . in this limit , the atoms can not follow the shaking motion adiabatically and remain thus at their average lattice position , albeit with renormalized hopping parameters .",
    "the system is thus considered to be in a stationary state and the knowledge of equilibrium physics can be employed .",
    "let us consider the floquet hamiltonian defined by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is periodic in time @xcite .",

    "in this section , the honeycomb lattice with anisotropic hopping is studied . in the first two subsections , only nn hopping is considered for illustration reasons .",
    "indeed , this allows for a simple understanding of the main consequences of shaking on dirac - point motion and dimensional crossover . in subsec .",
    "[ sec02c ] , we discuss how the picture evolves when nnn hopping is included , and the sign of the hopping parameters is investigated in subsec .",
    "[ sec02d ] .",
    "since the system with two nn equal hopping parameters and a single independent one captures the essential features of the systems with three independent nn hopping parameters , we will focus on this system .",
    "the numbering of the @xmath61s is chosen such that @xmath69 , which can be achieved by shaking in a direction parallel or perpendicular to @xmath19 .",
    "although the atoms in the optical lattice are charge - neutral objects , we shall adopt the language from condensed - matter physics and call a zero - gap phase with a pair of dirac cones and a vanishing density of states at the band - contact points a _ semimetal _ , whereas a gapped phase is called _",
    "band insulator_. furthermore , nnn hopping induces a _ metallic _",
    "phase for small values of @xmath61 because of an overlap between the two bands that yields a non - vanishing density of states at the energy level of the band - contact points .",
    "if the latice is shaken in the direction perpendicular to @xmath19 ( direction 1 in fig.[fig : lattice ] ) , @xmath70 remains equal to @xmath71 , whereas @xmath72 and @xmath73 are renormalised to a smaller value .",
    "an increase in the shaking amplitude results in a decrease in @xmath74 , which is depicted by the arrow @xmath75 in fig.[fig : phase - diagram - abs](a ) .",
    "when the hopping parameters change according to this arrow @xmath75 , the energy spectrum evolves from fig.[fig : merging - energy - dispersion](a ) to fig.[fig : merging - energy - dispersion](b ) .",
    "the dirac points , originally situated at the corners @xmath0 and @xmath1 of the first brillouin zone , start to move in the @xmath76-direction along the vertical edges of the latter .",
    "this motion is depicted by the arrows in fig.[fig : phase - diagram - abs](b ) . even if the two dirac points are no longer located at the high - symmetry points @xmath0 and @xmath1 , they remain related by time - reversal symmetry , such that their berry phases @xmath77 and @xmath78 are opposite .",
    "this non - zero berry phase topologically protects each of the dirac points and thus the semimetallic phase remains robust until @xmath79 , where the two points merge at a time - reversal invariant momentum , i.e. half of a reciprocal lattice vector @xcite . in the present example , this point is situated at the center of the vertical edges of the first brillouin zone , and the band dispersion becomes parabolic in the @xmath80-direction while remaining linear in the @xmath81-direction [ see fig.[fig : merging - energy - dispersion](b ) ] .",
    "the merged dirac points are no longer topologically protected due to the annihilation of the opposite berry phases .",
    "consequently , a further increase of the shaking amplitude , which results in a further decrease of @xmath82 , leads to the opening of a gap between the two bands .",
    "thus , the system undergoes a topological phase transition from a semimetal to a band insulator .",
    "this merging transition was also studied in a static setup in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the hopping amplitudes @xmath71 were proposed to be modified by a change in the intensity of one of the lasers used to create the optical lattice .",
    "in contrast to this static setup , shaking the honeycomb lattice allows one to completely annihilate some of the nn hopping parameters and to even change their sign .",
    "this sign change occurs at the zeros of the bessel function [ see eq.([eq : renormalized - gamma ] ) ] . for an example system of @xmath83k atoms in a lattice created by lasers with a wavelength of 830 nm , which is shaken in the direction perpendicular to @xmath19 , the situation @xmath84 is encountered for    @xmath85    which corresponds to the first zero of the bessel function . at this particular point , and if @xmath86 in addition , the system consists of a set of effectively decoupled horizontal bonds along which the atoms are solely allowed to hop .",

    "the area with higher contrast is the first brillouin zone . ]",
    "another dimensional crossover , from 2d to 1d , may be obtained if the lattice is shaken in the direction parallel to one of the nn vectors ( direction 2 in fig.[fig : lattice ] ) . here , we choose @xmath93 to maintain the symmetry @xmath94 . in this case ,",
    "both @xmath70 and @xmath82 are renormalized by bessel functions , albeit with different arguments .",
    "since all hopping parameters are renormalized , the trajectory of the system in the phase space upon increasing the shaking amplitude is not a straight line , as was the case for shaking perpendicular to a hopping direction , and has a new feature : the alignment of dirac points , which occurs for @xmath95 .",
    "the first zero of @xmath70 is found at @xmath96 for the same system of @xmath83k atoms mentioned above . here , for illustrative purposes , a simplified trajectory of the system",
    "is depicted in fig.[fig : merging - energy - dispersion ] by arrow @xmath10 , which corresponds to the motion of the dirac points in reciprocal space as shown in fig.[fig : phase - diagram - abs](c ) . as @xmath70 approaches zero ,",
    "the dirac points align in lines parallel to the @xmath81-axis at @xmath97 and the energy barriers between the aligning points are lowered .",
    "consequently , when @xmath95 , the energy spectrum contains lines where the two energy band meet and the dispersion is linear , as is shown in fig.[fig : merging - energy - dispersion](d ) . the dispersion relation ( [ dispersionrel ] ) then reads simply @xmath98 and one clearly sees the 1d character . indeed , there is no dispersion in the @xmath89-direction , as is also evident from fig.[fig : merging - energy - dispersion](d ) , and the system may be viewed as completely decoupled 1d chains in which the zig - zag arrangement is of no importance . in this particular limit , the sites a and b are therefore no longer inequivalent such that the unit cell is effectively divided by two , and the size of the first brillouin zone is consequently doubled .",
    "the aligned dirac points may thus , alternatively , be viewed as due to an artificial folding of the second ( outer ) half of the first brillouin zone into its inner half .",
    "however , this aspect is very particular in that the brillouin zone immediately retrieves its original size when @xmath70 is small , but non - zero , or if nnn hoppings are taken into account . in both cases , one needs to distinguish the two different sublattices and one obtains a dispersion in the @xmath89-direction .",
    "the actual behavior of the system for an increasing shaking amplitude is discussed in sec.[sec04 ] .",
    "this behavior is more complicated because all three nn hopping parameters are renormalized , which , beyond the alignment , leads to the merging of dirac points and the opening of a gap also in the case of shaking parallel to one of the nn vectors . in the absence of nnn",
    "hopping , the 0d limit can be reached in addition .",
    "the major consequence of nnn hopping is to break particle - hole symmetry , as may be seen from eq .",
    "( [ dispersionrel ] ) , where non - zero values of @xmath99 yield @xmath100 .",
    "its relevance depends sensitively on the shaking direction , because of the different renormalization of the nn hopping parameters .",
    "the band structure with nnn hopping included is depicted in fig.[fig : nnn - energy - dispersion ] for different shaking directions .      in the case of a shaking perpendicular to @xmath19 , only @xmath82",
    "are decreased , whereas @xmath101 remains the leading energy scale in the band structure . as a reference direction , but it may naturally be replaced by any other direction @xmath102 , in which case @xmath103 remains constant . ]",
    "the band structure for the unshaken lattice is depicted in fig.[fig : nnn - energy - dispersion](a ) for @xmath104 , and one notices that the main features of the band structure , namely the dirac points , are unaltered with respect to the case @xmath86 in fig.[fig : merging - energy - dispersion](a ) , apart from the flattening of the upper band as compared to the lower one .",
    "when approaching the merging transition @xmath79 , the value of which is determined by the zeros of @xmath105 in eq .",
    "( [ fq ] ) and that therefore does not depend on the nnn hopping parameters , the band width remains dominated by the largest hopping parameter @xmath70 , such that the band structure [ fig.[fig : nnn - energy - dispersion](b ) ] at the transition is essentially the same as in fig.[fig : merging - energy - dispersion](b ) for @xmath86 . in the 0d limit , with @xmath106 the originally flat bands [ fig.[fig : merging - energy - dispersion](c ) ] acquire the weak dispersion of a triangular lattice as a consequence of the non - zero nnn hopping parameters .",
    "however , as expected from the above arguments , the dispersion is on the order of @xmath107 and thus small as compared to the energy separation @xmath108 between the two bands .",
    "in contrast to a shaking direction perpendicular to @xmath19 , nnn hopping has more drastic consequences if the lattice is shaken in the direction parallel to @xmath19 . in this case , all nn hopping parameters are decreased , and the relative importance of nnn hopping is enhanced .",
    "notice further that the nnn lattice vectors @xmath109 are now perpendicular to the shaking direction such that @xmath110 remains unrenormalized .",
    "also in this case , the system is approaching the 1d limit , with @xmath111 [ see fig.[fig : nnn - energy - dispersion](d ) ] .",
    "however , in contrast to fig.[fig : merging - energy - dispersion](d ) , the chains remain coupled by nnn hopping that yields a dispersion in the @xmath89-direction . furthermore ,",
    "as mentioned above , the a and b sites are now not equivalent from a crystallographic point of view , such that the outer parts of the first brillouin zone can not be folded back into the inner one , as may be seen from fig.[fig : nnn - energy - dispersion](d ) .",
    "finally , for particular values of the shaking amplitude in the direction parallel to @xmath19 , the nn hopping parameters can be decreased in such a manner as to render @xmath82 more relevant . in this case , the two bands can overlap in energy , as depicted in figs.[fig : nnn - energy - dispersion](e ) and [ fig : nnn - energy - dispersion](f ) for @xmath112 ( in which case @xmath113 ) and @xmath114 ( with @xmath115 ) , respectively . in the latter example",

    "the quality of the results obtained by raman spectroscopy is comparable to those of a homogeneous system @xcite .",
    "furthermore , raman spectroscopy yields better results for a system with strong interactions compared to standard time - of - flight measurements @xcite .",
    "notice that momentum resolved raman spectroscopy was originally proposed to be applied to a gas of ultracold fermionic atoms at equilibrium and not for a shaken lattice .",
    "we therefore discuss , in this final paragraph , why we think that this technique may also be applied to the present case .",
    "naturally , as long as the frequencies of the additional lasers in the raman - spectroscopy setup are small with respect to the shaking frequency , @xmath183 , even the full system satisfies the condition ( [ eq : condition ] ) for the validity of floquet theory . as in the case of interactions ,",
    "one needs , however , to avoid resonances between the different laser frequencies that could become critical @xcite . the opposite limit , in which the laser frequencies and that of the hyperfine transition are larger than the shaking frequency , is more delicate .",
    "however , even then , the shaken system remains at quasi - equilibrium as long as the intensities of the lasers used in raman spectroscopy are weak , such that they only constitute a small perturbation .",
    "the atomic dynamics probed even at high frequencies is therefore still that of the atoms at quasi - equilibrium , with the band strucure obtained from floquet theory .",
    "furthermore , in the experimental studies by zenesini _",
    "et al_. @xcite , time - of - flight measurements were used to determine the momentum distribution of bosonic atoms in a shaken lattice .",
    "apart from the time - scale considerations , there are also some length scales that need to be taken into account .",
    "there are indeed two requirements for the correct size of the focus of the laser beams . on the one hand",
    ", it needs to be larger than the lattice spacing , such that sufficiently many atoms can be excited , while on the other hand the focus of the beams should be small enough , in order to have an approximately flat trapping potential inside the focus area .",
    "in addition , choosing the length of the pulses could possibly be a problem , since for shorter pulses , the excited atoms will be less affected by the lattice potential , whereas for longer pulses more atoms can be excited , leading to a stronger signal .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the band engineering of fermionic atoms in an optical honeycomb lattice with the help of a periodic shaking of the lattice .",
    "if the shaking frequency @xmath24 is large enough , i.e. if @xmath124 constitutes the largest energy scale in the system , the floquet theory may be applied and the system is at quasi - equilibrium in the sense that the atoms can not follow the rapid motion associated with the shaking .",
    "depending on the direction of the shaking , one may render the hopping amplitudes in the quasi - static lattice anisotropic , due to a renormalization of the nn and nnn hopping parameters by bessel functions that go through zero and change sign . as a consequence ,",
    "dimensional crossovers can be induced in absence of the nnn hopping . for a shaking direction parallel to one of the nn vectors ( such as e.g. @xmath19 )",
    ", one can make one of the nn hopping parameters vanish , @xmath184 .",
    "the system then undergoes a transition from 2d to 1d , while the dirac points align simultaneously .",
    "shaking in the perpendicular direction ( @xmath185 ) allows one to decrease two nn hopping amplitudes simultaneously while maintaining @xmath70 unrenormalized . in this case , a dimensional crossover from 2d to 0d is induced for @xmath186 , leading to two flat energy bands , beyond the merging of dirac points @xcite , which occurs at @xmath187 .",
    "a nonzero value of @xmath107 breaks the particle - hole symmetry and leads to a coupling among the 1d chains and the 0d dimers , for the @xmath95 and @xmath106 cases , respectively , and thus to a weak 2d dispersion .",
    "the merging and the alignment of dirac points , however , are not affected . moreover , for a shaking direction parallel to @xmath19 , one pair of nnn hopping amplitudes [ @xmath109 ] remains unrenormalized , and its relative importance is thus enhanced when compared to the decreasing nn hopping amplitudes . in this limit , beyond the semi - metallic and the band - insulating phases , a novel metallic phase can appear that consists of particle and hole pockets with a non - vanishing density of states even at half - filling .",
    "furthermore , we have investigated the role of weak repulsive on - site interactions .",
    "the resulting ground state is then adiabatically connected to that of the non - interacting system , and we have self - consistently calculated the dependence of the atomic density on the ( local ) chemical potential .",
    "the density profiles of the different phases , e.g. the gapless semimetal or the gapped band insulator , and the different dimensionality may be measured experimentally by in - situ density measurements .",
    "moreover , momentum - resolved raman spectroscopy may be a promising technique to measure the band structure associated with these different phases .",

    "<S> inspired by the recent creation of the honeycomb optical lattice and the realization of the mott insulating state in a square lattice by shaking , we study here the shaken honeycomb optical lattice . for a periodic shaking of the lattice , a floquet theory may be applied to derive a time - independent hamiltonian . in this effective description </S>",
    "<S> , the hopping parameters are renormalized by a bessel function , which depends on the shaking direction , amplitude and frequency . consequently </S>",
    "<S> , the hopping parameters can vanish and even change sign , in an anisotropic manner , thus yielding different band structures . here , we study the merging and the alignment of dirac points and dimensional crossovers from the two dimensional system to one dimensional chains and zero dimensional dimers . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider next - nearest - neighbor hopping , which breaks the particle - hole symmetry and leads to a metallic phase when it becomes dominant over the nearest - neighbor hopping . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we include weak repulsive on - site interactions and find the density profiles for different values of the hopping parameters and interactions , both in a homogeneous system and in the presence of a trapping potential . </S>",
    "<S> our results may be experimentally observed by using momentum - resolved raman spectroscopy . </S>"
