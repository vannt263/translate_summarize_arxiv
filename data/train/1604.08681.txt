    "<S> examples constructed by the first author and charles read make it clear that many of the hereditary properties of amenability no longer hold for approximate amenability . these and earlier results of the authors also show that the presence of a bounded approximate identity  often facilitates positive results . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that the tensor product of approximately amenable  algebras need not be approximately amenable , and investigate conditions under which @xmath0 and @xmath1 being approximately amenable  implies , or is implied by , @xmath2 or @xmath3 being approximately amenable . once again , the role of having a bounded approximate identity  comes to the fore . </S>",
    "<S> our methods also enable us to prove that if @xmath2 is amenable , then so are @xmath0 and @xmath1 , a result proved by barry johnson in 1996 under an additional assumption .    </S>",
