    "physically allowed degree of entanglement and mixture for two - qubit mixed states were investigated by munro _",
    "et al . _ in terms of concurrence @xmath0 and normalized linear entropy @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "these authors characterize the subset @xmath2 on @xmath3 plane corresponding to possible states of the system and in particular identify maximally entangled mixed states @xmath4 laying on the boundary of that subset .",
    "the states @xmath4 have maximal allowed entanglement for a given degree of mixedness .",
    "they obtained this result analytically for some class of states .",
    "numerical results suggests correctness of the picture for general two - qubit states .    in this note , we consider the problem of violation of bell  chsh inequalities @xcite for mixed states .",
    "it is well known that quantum states violating these inequalities have to be entangled @xcite , but on the other hand , chsh violation is not necessary for mixed state entanglement @xcite . in the context of the results of ref.@xcite , we address the following question : what are the subsets of @xmath2 which correspond to states violating bell  chsh inequalities ? in our previous publication @xcite , we have studied the structure of such subsets in the case of specific class of quantum states .",
    "the results show that @xmath2 is a sum of disjoint subsets @xmath5 and @xmath6 with the following properties : states belonging to @xmath7 violate chsh inequalities , whereas states from @xmath8 fulfil all chsh inequalities . the subset @xmath6 has somehow unexpected property : for any pair @xmath9 there are two families of states with the same entropy and concurrence such that all states from one family violate chsh and at the same time , all states from the other family fulfil all chsh inequalities . in the present paper , we continue these investigations for general class of two - qubit states .",
    "first we consider larger class of states still admitting explicit formulas for linear entropy , concurrence and degree of chsh violation .",
    "unfortunately , analytical analysis of the relation between these functions is not possible .",
    "numerical investigations lead to some modifications of the picture from ref .",
    "@xcite , but the general structure is not changed . finally , this problem is studied using numerically generated arbitrary density matrices .",
    "the results indicate that the structure of @xmath2 for general two - qubit states seems to be the same .",
    "we consider also the problem of maximal violation of chsh inequalities . for a class of mixed states we obtain counterpart of the result of ref.@xcite",
    ", namely we find the form of mixed states with maximal degree of chsh violation for given linear entropy .",
    "all that states lie on specific curve on entropy  concurrence plane .",
    "numerical results suggest also that general two  qubits states with this property satisfy the same relation between entropy and concurrence",
    ". as we show , maximal violation of bell inequalities with fixed linear entropy is not equivalent to the maximal entanglement under the same conditions .",
    "let @xmath10 be the unit vectors in @xmath11 and @xmath12 . consider the family of operators on two - qubits hilbert space @xmath13 @xmath14 then bell - chsh @xcite inequalities are @xmath15",
    "if the above inequality is not satisfied by the state @xmath16 for some choice of @xmath17 , we say that @xmath16 _ violates bell - chsh inequalities .",
    "_ in the case of two - qubits , the violation of bell - chsh inequalities by mixed states can be studied using simple necessary and sufficient condition @xcite .",
    "consider real matrix @xmath18 and real symmetric matrix @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the transposition of @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the eigenvalues of @xmath24 .",
    "as was shown in @xcite @xmath25 thus ( [ chsh ] ) is violated by some choice of @xmath26 if and only if @xmath27 .",
    "we need also the measures of degree of entanglement and mixture for given state . in the case of two qubits , the useful measure of degree of entanglement",
    "is concurrence @xmath0 @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the maximal eigenvalue of @xmath30 and @xmath31 with @xmath32 denoting complex conjugation of the matrix @xmath16 .",
    "it is known that @xmath0 can be used to obtain entanglement of formation , which is natural measure of entanglement for mixed states @xcite . to measure degree of mixture , or deviation from pure state",
    ", we use linear entropy @xmath33 which is normalized such that its maximal value equals @xmath34 .",
    "to study the subset of entropy  concurrence plane corresponding to violation of chsh inequalities , consider first the following class @xmath35 of states @xmath36 where @xmath37,\\ : a , b\\geq 0,\\ : \\theta\\in [ 0,2\\pi]\\ ] ] and @xmath38 notice that for @xmath39 @xmath40 define the subset @xmath41 @xmath42 in the paper @xcite , we analysed the set ( [ obszar ] ) and we have shown that it is a sum of disjoint subsets @xmath43 and @xmath8 with properties :    1 .   if @xmath44 , then every state @xmath45 such that @xmath46 and @xmath47 satisfies @xmath27 .",
    "2 .   if @xmath48 , then there exist states @xmath49 such that @xmath50 and @xmath51 , but @xmath52 .",
    "3 .   if @xmath53 , then every state @xmath45 such that @xmath46 and @xmath47 satisfies @xmath54 .    detailed analytic description of regions @xmath55 and @xmath8 as well as the proof of the above properties , can be found in ref . @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we try to extend this analysis to the larger class of two - qubit states . for general mixed two - qubit states",
    "there is a bound on concurrence that guarantees violation of chsh inequalities irrespective of linear entropy .",
    "it follows from the result of verstraete and wolf @xcite that minimal violation of chsh inequality for given concurrence @xmath56 is equal to @xmath57 so if @xmath58 then minimal value of @xmath59 is greater then @xmath34 , and every state satisfying ( [ cbound ] ) violates chsh inequality . on the other hand ,",
    "there is a bound on linear entropy that guarantees fulfilling chsh inequalities irrespective of concurrence .",
    "it is given by the result of santos @xcite that all states with ( normalized ) linear entropy @xmath60 satisfy all chsh inequalities .",
    "we see that these general bounds are compatible with our previous analysis ( fig . 1 ) and possible modifications can occur in region @xmath61 below the line @xmath62 and in region @xmath63 on the left hand side of the line @xmath64 .",
    "consider now the larger class @xmath65 of states of the form @xmath66 one can check that for that class @xmath67 where @xmath68 & c_{2}=2\\ , ( \\ , |{\\rho}_{23}|-\\sqrt{{\\rho}_{11}{\\rho}_{44}}\\ , ) \\end{split}\\ ] ] and @xmath69 moreover , @xmath70\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the class ( [ class1 ] ) , analytic description of regions of @xmath71 where @xmath27 or @xmath54 is not possible , but it can be done numerically .",
    "results of numerical analysis of the class @xmath65 are presented on fig .",
    "we see that the region @xmath61 where all states violate chsh inequalities is not changed , but there are states with @xmath27 for some points in @xmath63 , so the region @xmath72 is slightly enlarged .    to study this problem for general two - qubit density matrices , we numerically generate @xmath73 randomly chosen density matrices . for such two - qubit states",
    "the structure of the set of pairs @xmath74 is very simple .",
    "there are only points corresponding to @xmath27 or @xmath54 ( fig .",
    "3 ) . notice that by the method of random choice of states , not all points of @xmath2 are achieved ( the boundary of generated set correspond exactly to the class of werner states ) , but the obtained structure is compatible with previous results .",
    "to have some insight into the properties of the remaining part of the set @xmath2 , we modify the method of generation of states and consider density matrices lying close to the boundary of the set of all states i.e. such @xmath16 that one of its eigenvalues is almost equal to zero . for these randomly generated states , the pairs @xmath74 cover the whole set @xmath2 , and its structure is the same as for the class @xmath65 ( fig .",
    "the results suggest that the picture obtained using the class @xmath65 should be correct also for all two - qubit density matrices , although for most of randomly chosen density matrices @xmath16 with fixed mixedness and linear entropy , either @xmath27 or @xmath54 .",
    "unfortunately , we do not know analytic description of the boundary of the enlarged region @xmath6 .",
    "consider now the values of @xmath75 for states violating bell  chsh inequalities .",
    "we are especially interested in maximal values of @xmath75 . for the class ( [ class ] ) @xmath76 we see that ( [ m ] ) is maximal iff @xmath77 , and then @xmath78 by general result of verstraete and wolf @xcite , for any two - qubit state , ( [ mmax ] ) is the maximal degree of chsh violation for given concurrence @xmath79 .",
    "but we ask another question : what is the maximum of ( [ mmax ] ) _ for fixed linear entropy _ , and which states realize that maximum ?",
    "we can simply answer this question for the class of states ( [ class ] ) .",
    "since @xmath80 so fixing @xmath81 , we obtain @xmath82 maximum of ( [ msfixed ] ) is achieved at @xmath83 and equals to @xmath84 for @xmath85 $ ] .",
    "in this way we obtain    in the class ( [ class ] ) , states maximizing degree of violation of chsh inequalities for fixed linear entropy , lie on the curve @xmath86 and have the form @xmath87 with @xmath88,\\ : \\theta\\in [ 0,2\\pi]\\ ] ] moreover , @xmath89    it is instructive to compare the value of @xmath90 with degree of chsh violation for some other classes of states .",
    "let @xmath91 be the family of werner states @xmath92 where @xmath93 is a singlet state of two - qubits .",
    "then @xmath94 for maximally entangled mixed states @xmath4 introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , the corresponding value of @xmath59 is given by @xmath95 we see that for a fixed linear entropy @xmath96 although @xmath97 so      the family of states with maximal degree of violation of bell  chsh inequalities has another remarkable property .",
    "it is known that fidelity of state @xmath16 defined as @xmath98 where the maximum is taken over all maximally entangled pure states @xmath99 is bounded above by @xcite @xmath100 by direct computation , one can check that @xmath101 thus          99 w.j .",
