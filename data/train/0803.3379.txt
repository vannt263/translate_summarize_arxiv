    "the study of vortices and their existence , stability and dynamical properties has been a central theme of study in the area of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite . in particular , the remarkable experiments illustrating the generation of vortices @xcite and of very robust lattices thereof @xcite have stirred a tremendous amount of activity in this area in the past few years , that has by now been summarized in various reviews and books ; see for example @xcite .",
    "much of this activity has been centered around the robustness of vortex structures in the context of the mean - field dynamics of the becs ( which are controllably accurately described by a nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation ) in the presence of many of the potentials that are relevant to the trapping of atomic becs including parabolic traps @xcite and periodic optical lattice ones @xcite .",
    "particularly , the latter context of optical lattice potentials is quite interesting , as it has been suggested that vortices ( for example of topological charge @xmath0 ) will be unstable when centered at a minimum of the lattice potential @xcite , an instability that it would be interesting to understand in more detail .    on the other hand , the becs in the presence of periodic potentials",
    "have been argued to be well - approximated by models of the discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) type ( i.e. , resembling the finite - difference discretization of the continuum equation ) @xcite . in that regard , to understand the existence and stability properties of vortices in the presence of periodic potentials , it would be interesting to analyze the discrete analog of the relevant nls equation .",
    "this is also interesting from a different perspective in this bec context , namely that if finite - difference schemes are employed to analyze the properties of the continuum equation , it is useful to be aware of features introduced by virtue of the discretization .",
    "however , it should be stressed that this is not a problem of restricted importance in the context of quantum fluids ; it is also of particular interest in nonlinear optics where two - dimensional optical waveguide arrays have been recently systematically constructed e.g. in fused silica in the form of square lattices @xcite ( and , more recently of even more complex hexagonal lattices @xcite ) , whereby discrete solitons can be excited . by analogy to their one - dimensional counterparts of discrete dark solitons , which have been created in defocusing waveguide arrays with the photovoltaic nonlinearity @xcite , we expect that it should be possible to excite discrete dark vortices in defocusing two - dimensional waveguide arrays",
    ". an especially interesting feature of dark solitons that was observed initially in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) is that on - site discrete dark solitons are stable for sufficiently coarse lattices , but they become destabilized beyond a certain coupling strength among adjacent lattice sites and remain so until the continuum limit where they are again restabilized ( as the point spectrum eigenvalue that contributes to the instability becomes zero due to the restoration of the translational invariance in the continuum problem ) @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of interest to examine if the instability mechanisms of discrete defocusing vortices are of this same type or are potentially different and how the relevant stability picture is modified as a function of the inter - site coupling strength .",
    "it is this problem of the existence , stability and continuation of the vortex structures as a function of coupling strength that we examine in the present work .",
    "we consider , in particular , a two - dimensional discrete non - linear schrdinger equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the discrete laplacian .",
    "we study the _ defocusing _ case when @xmath3 .",
    "in that case , equation ( [ eq : dyn ] ) is denoted as discrete gross - pitaevskii equation in analogy with its continuum counterpart @xcite .",
    "we look for time - periodic solutions with frequency @xmath4 . using the ansatz @xmath5",
    ", we obtain @xmath6 where we have set @xmath7 .",
    "the coupling parameter @xmath8 determines the strength of discreteness effects .",
    "the limit @xmath9 corresponds to the continuum ( stationary ) gross - pitaevskii equation : @xmath10    the case @xmath11 corresponds to the so - called anti - continuum ( ac ) limit @xcite .",
    "when equation ( [ eq : stat ] ) is considered on an infinite lattice @xmath12 , we look for solutions satisfying @xmath13 when @xmath14 , for which @xmath15 vanishes at one lattice site , e.g. at @xmath16 .",
    "such solutions are denoted as discrete vortices , or `` dark '' vortex solitons .",
    "if one trigonometric turn on any path @xmath17 around the vortex center changes the argument of @xmath15 by @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , then the vortex is said to have a topological charge ( or vorticity ) equal to @xmath20 .    in this paper",
    "we numerically investigate the existence and stability of such solutions on a finite lattice of size @xmath21 , @xmath22 being large ; our analysis is performed as a function of the lattice coupling parameter @xmath23 and we illustrate how to perform relevant continuations both from the continuum , as well as , more importantly from the ac limit ( section 2 ) .",
    "we mainly focus on numerically computing vortex solutions with vorticity @xmath0 and @xmath24 ( section 3 ) . in section 4",
    ", we also obtain such solutions in the presence of an external harmonic trap ( the latter is typically present in bec experiments ) .",
    "finally , section 5 presents our conclusions and some future directions of potential interest .",
    "we compute vortex solutions of ( [ eq : stat ] ) using the newton method and a continuation with respect to @xmath23 .",
    "the path - following can be initiated either near the continuum limit ( for @xmath23 large ) or at the anti - continuum limit @xmath25 , since in both cases one is able to construct a suitable initial guess for the newton method .    for relatively high @xmath23",
    ", a suitable initial condition for a vortex with topological charge @xmath20 is obtained with a pad approximation developed for the continuum limit in @xcite .",
    "we set @xmath26 , where @xmath27 ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , see reference @xcite ) , @xmath31 once a vortex is found for a given @xmath23 , the solution can be continued by increasing or decreasing @xmath23 .",
    "although this method was found to be efficient , it remains limited to single vortex solutions having explicit continuum approximations .",
    "moreover , when the newton method is applied to continue these solutions near @xmath25 , the jacobian matrix becomes ill - conditioned ( and non - invertible for @xmath25 ) and the iteration does not converge .    in what follows",
    "we introduce a different method having a wider applicability , and for which the above mentioned singularity is removed .",
    "we consider a finite @xmath21 lattice with @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) , equipped with fixed - end boundary conditions given below .",
    "we set @xmath34 and note @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "one obtains the equivalent problem @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 $ ] and @xmath40 $ ] can be rewritten @xmath41 @xmath42 now we divide equation ( [ acp ] ) by @xmath23 ( this eliminates the above - mentioned degeneracy at @xmath25 ) and consider equation ( [ acm2 ] ) coupled to @xmath43 system ( [ acm2 ] ) , ( [ acp2 ] ) is supplemented by the boundary conditions @xmath44 the prescribed value @xmath45 of the angles on the boundary will depend on the type of vortex solution we look for .",
    "in particular , we use the boundary conditions @xmath46 for a single vortex with topological charge @xmath20 centered at @xmath16 .    for @xmath25",
    ", a single vortex at @xmath16 corresponds to fixing @xmath47 and @xmath48 everywhere else .",
    "equation ( [ acp2 ] ) yields in that case @xmath49 supplemented by the four following relations at @xmath50 @xmath51 for a vortex with topological charge @xmath0 , solutions of ( [ tinf])-([aclp3 ] ) are computed by the newton method , starting from the initial guess @xmath52 .",
    "the symmetries of the problem allow one to divide by four the size of the computational domain .",
    "indeed one can take @xmath53 with the boundary conditions @xmath54 , @xmath55 . solutions on the whole lattice @xmath56",
    "have the symmetries @xmath57 , \\ \\ \\ \\ \\theta_{-n , m } = - \\theta_{n , m}\\ , [ 2\\pi ] .\\ ] ] these conditions make ( [ aclp1 ] ) automatically satisfied at @xmath16 ( @xmath58 need not being specified ) .",
    "afterwards , the corresponding solution of ( [ acm2 ] ) , ( [ acp2])-([tinf ] ) can be continued to @xmath59 by the newton method , yielding a solution @xmath60 of ( [ eq : stat ] ) ( see section [ numres ] ) . for higher topological charges ,",
    "the initial guess @xmath61 can be used to compute a vortex solution of ( [ eq : stat ] ) by the newton method .",
    "this is done in section [ numres ] also for @xmath24 .",
    "all these continuations are performed with a @xmath62 accuracy .",
    "in this section we analyze the existence and stability of discrete vortices centered on a single site , as a function of the coupling strength @xmath23 for fixed - end boundary conditions .",
    "the stability of the discrete vortex solitons is studied assuming small perturbations in the form of @xmath63 $ ] , the onset of instability indicated by the emergence of @xmath64 ; @xmath65 in this setting denotes the perturbation eigenfrequency .",
    "note that it is sufficient to consider the case @xmath66 for stability computations , because this case can always be recovered by rescaling time .",
    "figure [ fig : ac1 ] compares the computed angles @xmath67 with respect to the seed angle @xmath68 for fixed - end boundary conditions and @xmath69 .",
    "the most significant differences arise close to the vortex center .",
    "this figure also shows the dependence on @xmath22 of the difference between the angles @xmath70 for a given domain size @xmath22 and for a larger domain of size @xmath71 .",
    "this is done through @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the @xmath74-norm , and @xmath75 represent the angles at a given lattice size @xmath22 .",
    "the main contribution of this norm corresponds to the boundary sites . on the other hand , the decrease of this norm as a function of @xmath22 originates from the convergence of the configuration to an asymptotic form .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in the present paper , we examined the discrete analog of continuum defocusing vortices which are perhaps the prototypical coherent structure in the two - dimensional nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "we illustrated how to systematically obtain such structures through an appropriate continuation of the amplitude and phase profiles from the anti - continuum limit , and also discussed how to perform such a continuation from the continuum limit ( at least for single core vortices ) .",
    "such a continuation as a function of the coupling strength revealed significant analogies between these defocusing discrete vortices and their 1d analog of the discrete dark solitons , which are stable from coupling @xmath25 up to a critical coupling and are subsequently unstable for all higher couplings up to @xmath76 ( when they become restabilized ) .",
    "something similar was observed and quantified in the case of discrete vortices .",
    "in addition to the most fundamental structures of topological charge @xmath0 , structures of higher charge such as @xmath24 were obtained by similar means .    a natural topic for a more detailed future study arising from the present work concerns the understanding of multi - vortex bound states and their stability properties , as well as their detailed continuation as a function of the coupling and eventual disappearance as the coupling becomes sufficiently large . another possible direction would be to examine such defocusing vortices in multi - component models ( in analogy e.g. , to the bright discrete vortices of @xcite ; see also references therein ) .",
    "there it would be of interest to study the similarities and differences of bound states of the same charge versus ones of , say , opposite charges . for these more demanding computations ( as well as possibly ones associated with the 3d version of the present model @xcite ) , more intensive numerical computations",
    "will be needed which may be aided by virtue of parallel implementation @xcite .",
    "such studies are currently in progress and will be reported in a future publication .",
