    "the acronym eno in the title of this paper stands for  essentially non - oscillatory \" , and it refers to a _ reconstruction _ procedure , which generates a piecewise polynomial approximation of a function from a given set of its cell averages .",
    "the essence of the eno procedure , which was introduced by harten et .",
    "al . in @xcite , is its ability to accurately recover discontinuous functions .",
    "the starting point is a collection of cell averages @xmath0 over consecutive intervals @xmath1 , @xmath2 from which one can form the piecewise constant approximation of the underlying function @xmath3 , @xmath4 but the averaging operator @xmath5 is limited to first order accuracy , whether @xmath6 is smooth or not ; for example , if @xmath6 has bounded variation then @xmath7 .",
    "the purpose of the eno procedure ( abbreviated by @xmath8 ) is to reconstruct a higher order approximation of @xmath3 from its given cell averages , @xmath9 here , @xmath10 are polynomials of degree @xmath11 such that the piecewise - polynomial eno reconstruction @xmath12 satisfies the following two essential properties .",
    "accuracy : :    first , it is an approximation of @xmath3 of order    @xmath13 in the sense that @xmath14 where    @xmath15 . typically , the requirement for    accuracy is sought whenever @xmath16 is sufficiently    smooth in a neighborhood of @xmath17 . here , however , ( [ eq : acc ] )    is also sought at isolated points of jump discontinuities .",
    "thus , if we    let @xmath18 and    @xmath19 denote the point - values of    @xmath3 at the left and right of the interface at    @xmath20 , then ( [ eq : acc ] ) requires that    the corresponding reconstructed point - values ,    @xmath21    and    @xmath22 ,    satisfy    @xmath23    to address this requirement of accuracy , the @xmath24 s are    constructed from neighboring cell averages    @xmath25 for some    @xmath26 .",
    "the key point is to choose an    _ adaptive _ stencil ,    @xmath27    based on a data - dependent shift @xmath28 .",
    "this enables the    essential non - oscillatory property ( [ eq : acc ] ) , while making the eno    procedure _ essentially nonlinear_. conservation : :    the second property sought in the eno reconstruction is that the    piecewise - polynomial eno approximation be _ conservative _ , in sense of    conserving the original cell averages , @xmath29    the conservative property enables us to recast the eno procedure in an    equivalent formulation of nonlinear _",
    "interpolation_. to this end , let    @xmath30 denote    the primitive of @xmath3 .",
    "the given cell averages    @xmath31 now give rise to a set of    point - values    @xmath32 ,    @xmath33 a second - order approximation of these point - values is    given by the piecewise linear interpolant    @xmath34 .",
    "the eno approximation ,    @xmath35 , is a    higher - order accurate piecewise - polynomial interpolant ,    @xmath36    it interpolates the given data at the nodes ,    @xmath37 ,    and it recovers @xmath38 to high - order accuracy at the    interior of the cells ,    @xmath39 .",
    "now , let @xmath40 be the unique @xmath13-th order    polynomial interpolating the @xmath41 pointvalues    @xmath42 for some shift @xmath43    which is yet to be determined .",
    "then , it is a simple consequence of    that @xmath44 satisfies and and that    @xmath45    in this manner , eno reconstruction of cell averages is equivalent to    eno interpolation of the pointvalues of its primitive .",
    "we shall travel    back and forth between these two eno formulations .      when the underlying data is sufficiently smooth , the accuracy requirements can be met by interpolating the primitive @xmath46 on _ any _ set of @xmath41 point - values @xmath47 here",
    ", @xmath43 is the ( left ) _ offset _ of the interpolation stencil , which is indexed at _ half - integers _ , to match the cell interfaces . to satisfy the conservation property ( [ eq : interp ] ) , the stencil of interpolation must include @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "there are @xmath13 such stencils , ranging from the leftmost stencil corresponding to an offset @xmath50 to the rightmost stencil corresponding to an offset of @xmath51 .",
    "since we are interested in approximation of piecewise smooth functions , we need to choose a carefully shifted stencil , in order to avoid spurious oscillations . the main idea behind",
    "the eno procedure is the use of a stencil with a data - dependent offset , @xmath52 , which is _ adapted to the smoothness of the data_. the choice of eno stencil is accomplished in an iterative manner , based on divided differences of the data .",

    "the eno reconstruction procedure was introduced in 1987 by harten et .",
    "@xcite in the context of accurate simulations for piecewise smooth solutions of nonlinear conservation laws .",
    "since then , the eno procedure and its extensions , @xcite , have been used with a considerable success in computational fluid dynamics ; we refer to the review article of shu @xcite and the references therein .",
    "moreover , eno and its various extensions , in particular , with subcell resolution scheme ( eno - sr ) , @xcite , have been applied to problems in data compression and image processing in @xcite and references therein .",

    "the sign property is illustrated in figure [ fig : eno ] , which shows a third- , fourth- and fifth - order eno reconstruction of randomly chosen cell averages .",
    "even though the reconstructed polynomial may have large variations within each cell , its jumps at cell interfaces always have the same sign as the jumps of the cell averages . moreover , the relative size of these jumps is uniformly bounded .",
