    "for more than two decades , synchronization of chaos and hyperchaos have been an active field of research in various fields , including physics , biology , mathematics , engineering , etc . after the seminal paper of pecora and carrol @xcite on chaos synchronization , several synchronization schemes and processes have been observed and identified ; example inludes , complete synchronization , generalized synchronization , phase synchronization , lag synchronization , anticipatory synchronization , impulsive synchronization , etc .",
    "( for detailed discussion refer to two excellent review papers @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "after the initial emphasis on the synchronization of low dimensional chaotic systems ( i.e. , chaotic systems having a single positive lyapunov exponent ) , researchers soon attracted towards the study of synchronization in high - dimensional systems like complex network @xcite , and nonlinear delay dynamical system ( dds ) .",
    "particularly , studies on the synchronization scenario of delay dynamical systems are challenging , both from theoretical and experimental point of view , owing to their infinite dimensionality with a large number of positive lyapunov exponents .",
    "further , in real world most of the time we have to encounter with time - delay ; few examples are , blood production in patients with leukemia ( mackey - glass model ) @xcite , dynamics of optical systems ( e.g. ikeda system ) @xcite@xcite , population dynamics @xcite , physiological model @xcite , el nio / southern oscillation ( enso ) @xcite , neural networks @xcite , control system , etc .",
    "the first study on synchronization of chaos in time - delayed system has been reported by pyragas @xcite .",
    "later , several genres of synchronizations in time - delay systems have been reported ; few examples are ( without claiming to be complete ) : lag and anticipatory synchronization @xcite , complete and generalized synchronization @xcite , etc .",
    "the phenomenon of phase synchronization in time - delayed systems has first been reported by senthilkumar et al @xcite and later it was confirmed experimentally in ref .",
    "recently , global phase synchronization and zero - lag synchronization ( zls ) in time - delay systems have been reported in @xcite and @xcite , respectively , showing the ongoing interest in the field of synchronization of time - delay systems . in all the above mentioned works",
    "( except @xcite ) , the coupling scheme is essentially the _ direct coupling _ , i.e. , either unidirectional coupling or bi - directional coupling , where either of the two coupled systems or both the systems directly affect the dynamics of each other . ref .",
    "@xcite considers mutual and subsystem coupling configurations via dynamical relaying and reports the experimental confirmation of zls in a system of three coupled piecewise linear time - delay circuits .",
    "an important coupling scheme has recently been reported , namely the _ environmental coupling _ , which is an",
    "_ indirect coupling _ @xcite scheme . here",
    "two or more systems interact indirectly with each other through a common environment .",
    "the environment makes the systems synchronous without affecting their central dynamical features .",
    "environmental coupling is particularly important in biological systems , e.g. , populations of cells in which oscillatory reactions are taking place interact with each other via chemicals that diffuse in the surrounding medium @xcite .",
    "the environmental coupling scheme has been investigated numerically in detail by reshmi et al @xcite where the phase and complete ( anti- ) synchronization of environmentally coupled low - dimensional chaotic systems ( rssler and lorenz systems ) are explored using lyapunov exponent spectrum , average phase errors , and correlation functions .",
    "a linear stability analysis has also been reported in that paper .",
    "later , the experimental study of the same has been reported in @xcite .",
    "amplitude death in environmentally coupled chaotic systems are reported in . in this context ,",
    "another important work has recently been reported by sharma et al .",
    "@xcite that considers a variant of environmental coupling to show ( both numerically and experimentally ) the occurrence of phase - flip bifurcation in periodic and chaotic systems .",
    "all the previous works on environmental coupling are restricted to the study of low - dimensional chaotic systems .",
    "the same for the time - delayed hyperchaotic system has not been reported yet ; particularly experimental realization of environmentally coupled hyperchaotic time - delayed system is challenging enough , and , to the best of our knowledge , yet to be reported . in this paper",
    "we study the synchronization states of two hyperchaotic time - delay systems that are coupled indirectly via a common environment . for the present study",
    "we choose a hyperchaotic time - delay system recently proposed in @xcite .",
    "the choice of this system is led by the fact that unlike other time - delay systems it poses three important features that are useful for the experimental design : first , it has a closed form mathematical function for the the nonlinearity ( unlike piece - wise - linear nonlinearity ) , second , it shows hyperchaos even for a small or moderate value of time - delay , and lastly , and most importantly , it can be realized with off - the - shelf electronic circuit components .",
    "further , the hyperchaotic attractor of the system is inherently phase - incoherent , thus the present study can be extended to other general class of hyperchaotic systems .",
    "we show that depending upon the coupling parameters a hyperchaotic time - delayed system can show in - phase or complete synchronization , and also inverse - phase or anti - synchronization . for",
    "the _ first _ time we report the experimental studies of synchronization of hyperchaos in time - delayed electronic oscillators coupled indirectly through a common environment .",
    "we confirm the occurrence of phase synchronization in the coupled system through the dynamical measures like generalized autocorrelation function , correlation of probability of recurrence , and the concept of localized sets @xcite computed directly from the experimental time - series data .",
    "we also perform a linear stability analysis of the coupled system for the complete and anti - synchronized cases .",
    "the experimental results are further supported by the detailed numerical simulations of the coupled system .",
    "numerical computations are carried out to find out the lyapunov exponent spectrum of the coupled system that confirms the transition from the in - phase ( inverse - phase ) synchronized state to the complete ( anti- ) synchronized state with the increasing coupling strength .",
    "numerical recurrence analysis and concept of localized set are used to reconfirm the occurrence of phase sysnchronization in the coupled system .",
    "the paper is organized in the following manner : the next section describes the environmental coupling scheme for a time - delay system , and also describes the system under consideration and a summary of its main dynamical behavior .",

    "the present study can be extended to explore the synchronization scenario of other environmentally coupled time - delay systems , e.g. mackey - glass system , ikeda system , etc .",
    "one of the main features of the environmental coupling scheme is that here the system dynamics in the synchronized states and unsynchronized states have almost the same structure in phase - space @xcite ; this particular feature makes this coupling scheme advantageous over other time - delay coupling schemes . from the academic interest ,",
    "as the environmental coupling is very much relevant to biological systems , and delay is inherent in biological processes , thus the present study will be important for the study of synchronizations in the biological systems with delay . apart from the academic interest , the present study is important from application point of view also ; for example , since with environmental coupling one can make a transition from complete synchronization to anti - synchronization by simply changing the sign of @xmath13 , thus this will be useful in easy implementation of hyperchaotic binary - phase - shift - keying ( bpsk)-based digital communication systems .",
