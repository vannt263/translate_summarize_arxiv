    "dust , and its relationship with the gas phase , are key ingredients in any recipe for galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "understanding the role of dust in the damped lyman-@xmath5 systems ( dlas ) seen in qso spectra is particularly important since dlas are thought to comprise a significant fraction of the high redshift gas available for star - formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "information about dust in dlas comes predominantly from the relative depletion of refractory ( e.g.  fe ) and non - refractory ( e.g.  zn ) elements onto dust grains ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this measures the amount of dust in dlas but does little to constrain the dust s composition or grain size .",
    "dla dust - reddening and extinction are potentially acute problems for flux - limited optical qso surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite examined this observationally by comparing the spectral indices of qso spectra with and without foreground dlas .",
    "they later detected @xcite and confirmed ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ) a significant difference between the spectral index distributions for the dla and control samples , concluding that up to 70per cent of bright qsos will be missed by flux - limited surveys @xcite .",
    "a recent radio - selected qso survey for dlas @xcite finds that optical surveys underestimate the dla number density per unit redshift by at most a factor of two .",
    "the dla and control samples of are quite small , comprising 26 and 40 sight - lines respectively . the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ;",
    "* ) includes a large , homogeneous qso sample with accurate spectrophotometric calibration and spectral resolution high enough ( @xmath6 ) to reliably detect dlas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the sdss therefore provides a powerful probe of dla dust - reddening .",
    "another intriguing result is the recent @xmath7 detection by @xcite of gravitational lensing ( gl ) caused by strong intervening mgii absorbers in the 2df qso redshift survey . by comparing the magnitude distributions of the mgii sample and a large control sample",
    ", they found an excess ( deficit ) of bright ( faint ) qsos with absorbers and demonstrated that this was consistent with a gl interpretation .",
    "it is important to confirm and explore the gl produced by dlas since , in principle , it provides a probe of the dark matter distribution in distant halos .",
    "also , if the gl magnification of the dla sample is large , dla dust - reddened qsos will be more detectable than those without , biasing any detection of dust - reddening .    in this paper",
    ", we select dlas and , importantly , a large control sample of qsos from the sdss data release 2 ( dr2 ; * ? ? ?",

    "we also tentatively confirm the gl effect and discuss the potential bias on reddening ( section [ sec : grav ] ) .",
    "we present only the main observational results here , leaving most details to a later paper .",
    "spectra for all objects classified as qsos in the sdss dr2 with emission redshifts @xmath8 were visually inspected and the small number ( @xmath9per cent ) which were clearly not qsos at the sdss - assigned emission redshift were rejected .",
    "we included those qsos not listed as ` primary ' targets in the sdss , i.e.  those which were not selected using the colour - space techniques of @xcite .",
    "other sdss sources were selected from the first and rosat surveys or could have been initially identified as stars or galaxies before spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "our sample is therefore largely , though not strictly , homogeneously selected .",
    "the results are robust against this small inhomogeneity ( sections [ ssec : dbias ] & [ ssec : gbias ] ) .",
    "we search for dlas between the  and  emission lines and , to avoid dlas intrinsic to the qsos and moderately broad absorption lines ( bals ) , we ignore the regions @xmath10 below  and above .",
    "a continuum is formed by iteratively fitting a third - order polynomial to overlapping @xmath11-  spectral chunks , rejecting pixels @xmath12 below and @xmath13 above the fit at each iteration until no more points are rejected ( @xmath14 is the sdss error array ) .",
    "the continuum chunks are combined by weighting each from zero at the edges to unity at the centre . finally , the continuum is smoothed over 25 pixels ( @xmath15 ) . this procedure yields reliable continua in most cases .",
    "however , 3 likely dlas were not selected due to poor fits near the continuum edges .",
    "candidate dlas are identified as absorption features with rest - frame equivalent width @xmath16 over a rest - frame @xmath17 window .",
    "visual inspection of each dla candidate is used to reject cases where no clear dla profile is observed .",

    "below this the algorithmic and visual assessment is unreliable .",
    "this is an important selection criteria for the gl study in section [ sec : grav ] and we discuss it further there .",
    "we also reject qsos with such severe bals that dla detection is unreliable , particularly those similar to lobal and felobals ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , we kept qsos with moderate bals ( e.g.  hibals ) since one can detect , and confidently not detect , dlas in these cases . this is discussed further in sections [ ssec : dbias ] & [ ssec : gbias ] .",

    "it is also well known that bals are somewhat redder than ` normal ' qsos ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "continuum errors and ly@xmath5 forest blending also contribute significantly to errors in @xmath50 .",

    "indeed , with a  threshold of 2per pixel , where we do find a deficit of low - s / n dla - bearing sight - lines , table [ tab : tests ] shows more negative slopes , @xmath61 .",

    "the metallicities and dust - depletion factors for s dlas are not especially different to those of the overall dla population .",
    "we suggest that small - number statistics may have affected their results .",
    "two notable differences between the sdss and qso samples are that the sdss contains much fainter qsos and extends to slightly higher and . though an increase in @xmath96 between the median  of the two samples ( @xmath100 and @xmath101 ) may contribute to this difference , evolution strong enough to entirely explain the discrepancy is unlikely given the results of various abundance studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "since sdss is a colour - selected survey , a population of dlas with high @xmath28hi@xmath52 and high @xmath96 can not be ruled out , leaving open concerns about biases in current estimates of the cosmological neutral gas mass density , @xmath102 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , our results provide direct evidence that dust - extinction is quite low in the known dla sample , consistent with indirect estimates from abundance studies which have been used to argue that any heavily reddened population of dlas is small @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that our dla selection is incomplete at low-@xmath28hi@xmath52 and so our result is relatively insensitive to a possible ( though seemingly unlikely ) anti - correlation between @xmath96 and @xmath28hi@xmath52 in dlas .",
    "we have also identified a possible signature of gravitational magnification of qsos by foreground dlas in a similar vein as .",
    "we expect an excess of bright qsos with dlas and a deficit of faint qsos with dlas relative to our control sample , where the dividing line should fall at @xmath103th magnitude in @xmath32 , @xmath30 and @xmath33 .",
    "this is indeed what is observed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mags ] ) .",
    "the amplitude of gravitational magnification , measured from the slope of the dla / control ratio versus magnitude , also broadly agrees with that expected in a simple model of the qso - dla lensing system .",
    "the putative lensing signal , though significant only at @xmath4 , is robust against a variety of systematic error and bias checks .",
    "furthermore , a higher equivalent width sub - sample of dlas gives a stronger signal , as would be expected if these dlas had lower impact parameters .",
