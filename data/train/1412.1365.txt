    "the stellar sources most relevant for dust production are low and intermediate mass stars during the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase and supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "a full understanding of the amount of dust produced by these stellar sources is essential for accounting the presence of large quantity of dust in galaxies .",
    "the analysis of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of high  redshift quasars shows that large reservoirs of dust are observed up to redshift @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "several investigations have addressed the dust evolution in galaxies of the local group @xcite and in high  redshift galaxies @xcite .",
    "these works were aimed not only at providing an exhaustive explanation of the observational scenario , but also to explain the presence of dust at early epochs @xcite .",
    "concerning the high redshifts , a lively debate is still open on the dominant source of dust .",
    "early investigations suggested the dominant role of sne @xcite , a conclusion challenged by subsequent studies , that stressed the importance of dust destruction by sne reverse shocks @xcite .",
    "recent studies showed that the dust present at high redshift is produced by all the stars more massive than @xmath9 , which points in favour of a non negligible contribution from agbs @xcite .",
    "the study of the dust produced by agb stars has been proved extremely useful in several astrophysical contexts , given the central role played by these stars on dust production and evolution in galaxies .",
    "the pioneering investigations by the heidelberg group @xcite were the first attempts to track down numerically the dust condensation sequences in agb stars : their scheme is based on a basic description of the stellar wind , assumed to expand isotropically from the stellar surface , and accelerated by radiation pressure acting on the dust grains .",
    "this approach represents an extremely simplified schematisation of a more complex situation , where formation and growth of dust particles is likely favoured by periodic shocks , triggered by large amplitude pulsations experienced by agbs @xcite .",
    "however , the hydrostatic atmosphere approximation is currently the only description that can be easily interfaced with stellar evolution codes , and was adopted more recently by different groups involved in this research @xcite .",
    "the results are still far from being completely reliable , owing to the uncertainties affecting the agb evolution ( mainly the description of mass loss and the treatment of the convective instability ) and the dust formation process ( e.g. sticking coefficients of some species , extinction properties , etc . ) .",
    "the differences among the results presented by the various groups outline the need for a further refinement of the models @xcite .",
    "the comparison with the observational scenario is therefore mandatory to confirm or disregard the theoretical models so far produced .",
    "the analysis of dusty agbs in the galaxy is not straightforward , owing to the obscuration from its own interstellar medium , and the unknown distances , that render uncertain the luminosity of the sources observed .",

    "the many data available , particularly in the infrared bands , where most of the emission from dust  enshrouded stars occurs , stimulated a series of investigations , with the scope of interpreting the observed colour  colour and color  magnitude diagrams , based on the reprocessing of the radiation emitted from the central star by dust particles present in the circumstellar envelope @xcite .",
    "these works are based on a wide exploration of the various quantities relevant for the determination of the spectrum of a single object ( effective temperature , surface gravity , luminosity , optical depth , size of the individual dust species formed ) , in the attempt of selecting the combinations of parameters allowing the best agreement with the observations , and to further refine the suggested classification of dust obscured stars in the lmc @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we tackle this problem from a different point of view .",
    "our goal is to provide a full and exhaustive interpretation of the observed distribution of dust obscured agb stars in the lmc , in the various colour  colour and colour  magnitude diagrams ( ccd and cmd , respectively ) obtained with the spitzer space telescope bands . in particular",
    ", we use the bands of the infrared array camera ( irac : 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath12 m ) and the @xmath13 m band of the multiband imaging photometer ( mips ) .",
    "this choice allows a detailed analysis of the properties of the individual star+dusty envelope systems , whose spectral energy distribution ( sed ) peaks in the infrared .",
    "our theoretical description is based on a complete modelling of the agb phase , that also account for dust formation in the wind , published in @xcite .",
    "this work represents an important step forward compared to the previously mentioned investigations , for the following reasons : i ) the choice of the parameters relevant for the determination of the synthetic spectra is not free , rather it is based on the results coming from agb modelling ; ii ) the mass distribution of the stars is calculated based on the lmc sfh by @xcite , according to the evolutionary times of the individual stars ; iii ) we do not use a single metallicity , rather we account for the distribution among different chemistries given by @xcite , considering models with @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ; iv ) points ( ii ) + ( iii ) allow not only a qualitative comparison between the observed colours of the individual stars and the expectations from the evolutionary tracks , but also a quantitative , statistical analysis , based on the relative number of stars populating different zones of the ccd and cmd considered .    a first step in this direction",
    "was recently made by @xcite , who analysed the group of dust obscured stars in the lmc classified as `` extreme '' @xcite ; following @xcite , they interpreted their distribution in the colour  colour ( @xmath0-[4.5]$ ] , @xmath1-[8.0]$ ] ) diagram using @xmath16 models of agb evolution + dust production in the winds . here",
    "we extend this work further , by considering a much larger sample of over 6000 agb candidates , and adopting the appropriate metallicity distribution suggested by @xcite .",
    "the present investigation proves important not only to interpret the properties of agb stars in the lmc ; it constitutes also an important test for the agb modelling and for the description of the dust formation process in the winds of agbs .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section 2 gives the numerical and physical input adopted to build the evolutionary sequences and to describe dust formation in the winds ; an overview on the main evolutionary properties of agbs is given in section 3 ; we propose a classification of agbs based on their position in the colour  colour and colour  magnitude diagrams obtained with the spitzer filters in section 4 .",
    "section 5 presents an overview of the observations of dust obscured agbs in the lmc and the synthetic modelling used for the population synthesis .",
    "the interpretation of the data is addressed in section 6 , while in section 7 we suggest the evolutionary status of the stars in pre  existing classifications .",
    "section 8 is focused on the expected dust production rate by agbs .",
    "the conclusions are given in section 9 .",
    "to produce the synthetic diagrams to be compared with the observed distribution of lmc agb stars in the different colour  colour and colour  magnitude diagrams in the spitzer bands we used stellar evolution models with a detailed description of the agb phase .",
    "the formation and growth of dust grains was described following the isotropic expansion of the stellar wind , from the stellar surface .",
    "the magnitudes in the 5 irac and mips bands were calculated by convolution of the synthetic spectra with the instrumental transmission curves of the different filters . in the following of this section",
    "we give more details of the steps required .",
    "the stellar evolution models were calculated by means of the aton code for stellar evolution .",
    "the interested reader may find in @xcite a detailed description of the numerical and physical input of the code ; the most recent updates , concerning in particular the adopted cross  sections for the reactions included in the nuclear network , can be found , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "the evolutionary sequences were calculated from the pre ",
    "main sequence phase until the almost complete loss of the star s hydrogen envelope ( the end of the agb phase ) . to follow the different populations present in the lmc we considered three different sets of models , with metallicity of @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 . in the first case we adopted an @xmath17enhancement",
    "@xmath18=+0.4 $ ] , whereas for the two more metal  rich models we used @xmath18=+0.2 $ ] .",
    "the initial abundances of elements other than @xmath19-elements and carbon are scaled from the solar abundance @xcite , accordingly to the fe abundance .",
    "the physical properties of the three sets of models , and the variation of their surface elemental abundance as they evolve on the agb , are extensively discussed in the previous papers published by our group @xcite . in table 1",
    "we report the evolutionary timescales of the various stellar models considered , in terms of the duration of the core hydrogen  burning phase ( @xmath20 ) and of the whole agb phase ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the latter timescale was determined by considering the time elapsed from the phase following the exhaustion of central helium to the total loss of the external mantle .",
    "we briefly recall the main physical and chemical input , most relevant for the description of the agb phase .",
    "* the temperature gradient in regions unstable to convective motions was found by means of the full spectrum of turbulence ( fst ) model developed by @xcite . as extensively discussed by @xcite , use of",
    "the fst scheme leads to strong hbb in models with initial mass above @xmath9 ; the ignition of hbb favours a severe destruction of the surface carbon @xcite , that prevents the star from reaching the c  star stage . * in convective regions , mixing of chemicals and nuclear burning are self  consistently coupled via a diffusive approach @xcite .",
    "overshoot from convective borders is simulated by an exponential decay of convective velocities from the neutrality layer , fixed via the schwartzschild criterion @xcite . during the core h- and he  burning phases we assumed an e  folding distance for the exponential decay of velocities from the border of the core of @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the pressure scale height ; this was obtained by comparison of the theoretical isochrones with open clusters colour  magnitude diagram by @xcite . during the agb phase",
    "some overshoot is assumed from the borders of the convective shell that develops during the thermal pulse and from the base of the convective envelope ; in this case the e ",
    "folding distance is @xmath24 , following the calibration aimed at reproducing the luminosity function of carbon stars in the lmc , given in @xcite . *",
    "mass loss was described following the description by @xcite in all the agb phases before the c  star phase begins .",
    "this treatment , based on hydrodynamic simulations by @xcite , assumes a steep dependence of mass  loss on luminosity ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "consequently , stars experiencing hbb are expected to loose mass at large rates . for carbon stars we used the formula giving the mass loss rate as a function of luminosity and effective temperature for the lmc , from the berlin group @xcite .",
    "this treatment is based on pulsating hydrodynamical models , in which mass loss is driven by radiation pressure on dust grains . * the molecular opacities in the stellar surface layers ( temperatures below 10,000k ) were calculated by means of the aesopus tool @xcite , which is necessary because of the increase in the opacity of the external regions when the mixture becomes enriched in carbon ; this is mainly due to the formation of cn molecules , occurring when the c / o ratio becomes larger than unity @xcite .",
    "the tables generated with the aesopus code are available in the range of temperatures @xmath26 .",
    "the reference tables assume the same initial composition of the models used in the present work . for each combination of metallicity and @xmath17enhancement ,",
    "additional tables are generated , in which the reference mixture is altered by varying the abundances of c , n and o. this step is done by introducing the independent variables @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , that correspond to the enhancement ( in comparison with the initial stellar chemistry ) of carbon , nitrogen and of the c / o ratio , respectively . in each stellar layer the opacity is found via interpolation on the basis of the value of temperature and density and of the mass fractions of the cno elements .",
    "@xcite showed that once the star enters the c  star phase the surface layers expand , which accelerates loss of the remaining hydrogen envelope , owing to the increase in the rate at which mass loss occurs .",
    "the winds of agbs are rather cool , given the small effective temperatures ( @xmath30 below @xmath31k ) ; in these cool winds dust particles can form more easily in regions sufficiently close to the surface of the star ( typically at distances in the range @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the stellar radius ) , where the densities are large enough to allow atoms and molecules to condense into dust grains . towards the end of their evolution , the effective temperature of agbs decreases considerably , as a consequence of the loss of their external envelope ; this effect is stronger in carbon stars , owing to the gradual enrichment in carbon of their surface layers , that leads to a general cooling of the whole zone close to the surface @xcite . therefore , in the final phases of their life agbs suffer very large mass loss rates , which also contributes to form large quantities of dust , because more gas particles are available for condensation . in a self  consistent approach , mass  loss should be calculated based on the dust formed , and the interaction of dust particles with radiation pressure . however , in the simple schematization adopted here , mass loss is assumed a priori , as a boundary condition . an interested reader may find in @xcite an exhaustive discussion on this limitation .    in the present work the growth of dust particles is calculated with a simple model for the stellar wind .",
    "the outflow is assumed spherically symmetric , and to have an initial expanding velocity from the surface of the star of @xmath34 .",
    "the description is done via a set of equations describing the rate of growth of each individual dust species ( starting from the innermost point where it forms ) .",
    "these relations are completed by mass and momentum conservation .",
    "mass conservation allows to determine the radial density of the gas ( see e.g. eq.2 in * ? ? ?",
    "the equation of momentum conservation considers the acceleration to the gas particles , due to effects of the radiation pressure on the already formed grains ; it allows the description of the increase of the velocity of the wind after dust formation begins , until an asymptotic value is reached ( typically from 5 to 30 @xmath35 as observed in agb stars ; * ? ? ?",
    "the necessary input for the description of the wind is the evolutionary status of the central object : the effective temperature , luminosity , mass  loss rate , and surface chemical composition , particularly the c / o ratio .",
    "an interested reader may find in @xcite all the relevant equations , and the discussion of the various uncertainties affecting the robustness of this approach , which is based on the pioneering explorations by the heidelberg group @xcite , and was also adopted in more recent investigations by @xcite .",
    "a common result from all these investigations is that in the winds of oxygen  rich stars formation of silicates occurs , at a distance that , depending on the effective temperature , is in the range @xmath36 from the stellar surface ; also small quantities of solid iron are present .",
    "@xcite find that the most stable dust species ( alumina dust , @xmath37 ) in oxygen  rich stars form at a typical distance of @xmath38 stellar radii from the stellar surface .",
    "the quantity of alumina dust formed is extremely sensitive to the amount of aluminium in the circumstellar envelope .",
    "silicon is more abundant than aluminium at the surface of agbs .",
    "therefore , silicates , though less stable , form in larger quantity compared to alumina grains and represent the dominant compound produced by oxygen ",
    "rich stars ; in addition , alumina is highly transparent to radiation , thus the wind is only scarcely accelerated by radiation pressure on @xmath37 grains .    in carbon ",
    "rich environments we find a similar situation @xcite , with a stable and extremely transparent dust species , silicon carbide ( sic ) , forming close to the surface of the star ( @xmath39 ) , surrounded by a more external region ( @xmath40 ) , where solid carbon grains form and grow ( see fig",
    ". 4.2 in * ? ? ?",
    "the latter species form in much greater quantities than sic , owing to the much larger availability of carbon atoms in comparison to silicon . also in this case some solid iron can form .    to calculate the extinction coefficients entering the momentum equation and the synthetic spectra , as described in next section ,",
    "we used the following optical constants : for silicates , we used results from @xcite ; for corundum , we used @xcite ; for iron , we adopted the optical constants by @xcite ; for sic , we based on the compilation by @xcite ; finally , results from @xcite were used for solid carbon .",
    "formation of silicates ( oxygen  rich stars ) and carbon ( c  stars ) particles favours a strong acceleration of the wind , whose velocity reaches rapidly an asymptotic behaviour . on the mathematical side , this allows to limit the computations to a region sufficiently far from the surface of the star ( @xmath41 ) , beyond which the velocity of the wind and the size of the dust species considered undergo only minor changes .      the modelling of the agb phase , discussed in section [ agbmodel ] , allows to determine the variation with time of the main physical quantities of the central star , namely the luminosity , effective temperature , surface gravity , rate at which mass  loss occurs . at the same time",
    "we follow the variation of the surface elemental abundances , for the species included in our network ( from hydrogen to silicon ) . because the nucleosynthesis in agbs is limited to species lighter than silicon , we assume that the iron content remains unchanged during the whole evolution .",
    "we use all these ingredients , as also the results of dust formation models , to calculate synthetic spectra , for some selected points along the evolutionary tracks ; this step allows to determine the magnitudes in the various bands , via convolution with the corresponding transmission curves .",
    "-50pt    the synthetic spectra were calculated in two steps , by means of the code dusty @xcite .    1 .   for carbon stars , we first considered the region from the surface up to the beginning of the solid carbon formation zone . in this preliminary step the only dust species considered is sic .",
    "as input radiation , we used the spectral energy distribution found by interpolation in surface gravity , effective temperature and c / o ratios among comarcs atmospheres @xcite of the appropriate metallicity .",
    "an analogous procedure was followed for oxygen  rich stars , with the difference that the only species considered is alumina , and the input spectrum is obtained by interpolating among the nextgen atmospheres @xcite of the same metallicity ; in this case the computations are extended until the formation of silicates begins . 2 .",
    "the spectral energy distribution obtained in step ( i ) , emerging from the sic ( alumina ) dust layer for c  stars ( oxygen  rich stars ) , is used as input for the second layer , where we consider reprocessing of the radiation by sic and solid carbon for c  stars ( alumina and silicates for oxygen  rich stars ) .",
    "the input necessary to steps ( i ) and ( ii ) are not assumed a priori ; they are found via the description of the dust formation in the wind , discussed in section [ dustmodel ] , that allows the determination of the dust grains size and composition , the temperature of the region where the various dust species form , and the radial distribution of the gas density . concerning the latter point ,",
    "although we know the radial variation of the dimension of the dust particles , we use a single grain size for each species , corresponding to the asymptotic value reached .",
    "this choice is motivated by the fact that the asymptotic value is reached rapidly once the dust begins to form , thus leading to a grain size distribution strongly peaked towards such asymptotic value . to determine the optical depth , @xmath42",
    ", we integrate along the radial direction the product of the number density of dust particles and the extinction cross section , based on the knowledge of the optical constants and the grain size .",
    "to compare the fluxes observed with those found via our spectral analysis , we adopted a distance to the lmc of 50kpc @xcite .

    "the relative fraction of stars in the observed sample used here , belonging to the cms group , is found to be in nice agreement with the expected percentage of cms , as indicated in table 2 .",
    "this indicates that the duration of the various evolutionary phases obtained via the theoretical models is consistent with the observational picture .",
    "compared with the observations of spectroscopically  confirmed stars , we see in fig . [ synpop ] that our models of cms explain the ir colours in the ccd1 and cmd24 diagrams of the o  rich stars by @xcite and of part of the c  rich stars by @xcite .    in the cmd2",

    "note that we do not need any a priori assumption of the gas / dust ratio , as the individual @xmath67 s are found by degree of condensation of the various key ",
    "species ( carbon for c  stars , silicon for oxygen  rich stars ) , which is a result of our modelling @xcite .    to determine the dust production rate for each individual object coming from our simulation in a given moment of the agb evolution , we proceed as in @xcite . for what concerns oxygen",
    " rich stars , the dust production rate at a given evolutionary phase is given by the contribution of the dust produced under the form of silicates , corundum and iron : @xmath69 with @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72    for what concerns c  stars , we consider the contributions from solid carbon , sic and iron : @xmath73 with @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath72    in the above expressions , the various @xmath76 s indicate the fraction of the key ",
    "species condensed into dust ; @xmath77 represent the mass fractions of the key  species at the surface of the stars ; @xmath78 indicate the weight of the various species considered .",
    "@xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 indicate , respectively , the rate at which silicates , corundum , iron , solid carbon and sic particles are ejected from the envelope of the star .    in agreement with @xcite",
    ", we find an overall dpr of @xmath84 @xmath85 , with relative contribution from carbon and oxygen  rich stars of , respectively , 4@xmath86 @xmath85 and 5@xmath87 @xmath85 . concerning the dust production from oxygen  rich stars ,",
    "our results indicate that it is almost entirely provided by hbbs , which represent only @xmath88 of the whole agb sample examined here .",
    "concerning the carbon component , half of the dust ejection rate is due to stars with @xmath0-[4.5 ] > 1 $ ] , including only @xmath89 objects .",
    "compared to the afore mentioned investigations , our dpr from c  rich stars is close to the results by @xcite , whereas for the o  rich component our findings are in better agreement with @xcite .",
    "we use models of stars of intermediate mass ( @xmath90 ) , evolved through the agb phase , integrated with the description of the dust formation process in the winds , to interpret spitzer observations of agbs in the lmc .",
    "we find that the position of the individual sources in the various colour  colour and colour  magnitude diagrams obtained with the spitzer bands is strongly connected with the mass and evolutionary phase experienced by the star ; c  stars and oxygen  rich objects with dust in their envelopes occupy well separated zones in some of the observational diagrams .",
    "metallicity is also found to play a role in this context .",
    "results from our modelling nicely reproduce the observations , in terms of the percentage of stars found in the different regions of the observational planes .",
    "the spectroscopically confirmed stars largely confirm our interpretation .",
    "we find that the majority ( 97@xmath7 ) of the most dust obscured objects , traditionally classified as `` extreme '' , are carbon stars surrounded by carbonaceous particles .",
    "these stars , in the ( @xmath0-[4.5]$ ] , @xmath1-[8.0]$ ] ) diagram , correspond to the observed diagonal strip at @xmath0-[4.5 ] > 0.2 $ ] .",
    "our models suggest that these stars are composed of multiple metallicities , starting from @xmath14 to @xmath16 .",
    "most of them are low ",
    "metallicity ( z @xmath91 ) objects , with ages ranging from @xmath92 yr to 3 gyr ; however , the reddest population , observed at @xmath0-[4.5 ] > 2 $ ] is entirely composed by higher ",
    "z stars ( z @xmath93 ) , with initial masses @xmath94 , in the very latest phases of the agb evolution .",
    "they are expected to be surrounded by an internal layer hosting sic particles of @xmath95 0.08 @xmath12 m size and a more external zone with 0.15 0.2 @xmath12 m sized carbon grains .",
    "the remaining part of the extreme sample is composed by more massive objects , experiencing hbb , surrounded by alumina dust ( @xmath96 m ) and silicates grains ( @xmath97 m ) ; these sources are the descendants of stars with initial masses @xmath98 formed @xmath99yr ago . only metal",
    " rich objects ( z @xmath100 ) are predicted to populate this sub - sample .",
    "the overall dust production rate is @xmath84 @xmath85 , with an 85@xmath7 contribution from c  stars , the remaining 15@xmath7 coming from m  stars .",
    "dpr from the latter sample is entirely given by stars experiencing hbb .",
    "the results of this analysis , to be confirmed by further spectroscopic investigations , will allow a considerable step forward in the characterization of the agb population of the lmc , opening the possibility of interpreting most of the stars observed , particularly those with the strongest dust thermal emission , in terms of mass of the precursor , metallicity , surface chemistry , and the properties of dust present in their winds .",
    "the same analysis can be extended to the small magellanic cloud and , thanks to the expected performances of the future space missions , to other galaxies of the local group .",
    "this study will also have an important feedback on the evolution properties of agbs , particularly towards a better understanding of the two most uncertain physical mechanisms characterizing this evolutionary phase , namely the extent of the third dredge - up and the strength of the hot bottom burning experienced by massive agbs .",
