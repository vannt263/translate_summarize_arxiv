    "over the past few decades photoemission based tools like photoelectron spectroscopy ( pes ) and angle - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy ( arpes ) have proven extremely successful in studying the chemical and electronic structure of solid state materials and surfaces@xcite . as a result ,",
    "physics of the photoemission phenomena has been well investigated with regards to explaining the angle resolved electron energy spectra obtained using uv and x - ray light sources .",
    "more recently , photoemission has gained popularity as a source of electrons for several applications like free electron lasers ( fels)@xcite and ultrafast electron diffraction ( ued)@xcite experiments .",
    "the quantum efficiency ( qe ) and the transverse ( to the normal on the photoemission surface ) momentum spread or the rms transverse momentum are the most critical figures of merit of the photoemission based electron sources ( or photocathodes ) that limit the performance of such applications@xcite .",
    "for example , the transverse coherence length of the electron beam in ued which limits the largest lattice size that can be studied is inversely proportional to the rms transverse momentum of electrons emitted from the cathode@xcite .",
    "the transverse momentum spread also limits the smallest possible electron beam emittance which defines the shortest possible lasing wavelength of an fel@xcite .",
    "the qe determines the drive laser power needed to obtain the electron bunch charge required for the particular application ; a low qe can implies high drive laser power often making the drive laser system prohibitively complex and expensive@xcite .",
    "high drive laser power can also limit the smallest possible rms transverse momentum through ultrafast laser heating of the electron gas@xcite .",
    "hence a high qe is required .    despite the technological importance of solid state photoemission as an electron source ,",
    "the physics that governs the relevant photoemission properties of qe and rms transverse momentum is not well understood .",
    "the first theory to model these photoemission parameters from metal cathodes was proposed by dowell and schmerge and followed a three step photoemission model@xcite .",
    "this theory successfully explained the qe and rms transverse momentum obtained from polycrystalline or disordered cathodes but did not model photoemission very close to the threshold accurately .",
    "an extension to this theory was developed recently , to model photoemission near the threshold@xcite .",
    "it showed that the smallest possible rms transverse momentum from polycrystalline surfaces is thermally limited by the temperature of the lattice .",
    "however these models did not include the effects of band structure , polarization and angle of incident light ( the vectorial photoelectric effect@xcite and did not model emission from single crystal surfaces of metals .",
    "a technique to estimate the rms transverse momentum spread from single crystal faces of metal cathodes using the band structure calculated from density functional theory was developed by schroeder _ _ et al__@xcite .",
    "however , this technique does not estimate the qe and assumes uniform probability of photoemission from any given electron state which is generally not true .    in this paper",
    ", we present a scheme to calculate the qe and transverse momentum spread accurately using an one - step photoemission model . our model is a 3-d expansion of the 1-d photoemission model developed by miller _ _ et al.__@xcite to explain ultraviolet photoemission spectra ( ups ) obtained from single crystals surfaces of noble metals .",
    "photoemission is modelled as a one step process of the transition of electrons from the initial bulk or surface state ( ss ) inside the metal to a time - reversed leed like free electron state under the influence of the electromagnetic field of the incident light .",
    "we obtain the rate of such a transition using the fermi golden rule to calculate the qe and the rms transverse momentum of emitted electrons .",
    "this photoemission model takes into account the effects of band structure , polarization and angle of incident light .    using the ( 111 ) surface of silver as an example",
    ", we show that our model predicts the qe near threshold accurately and explains the effects of polarization of incident light and angle of incidence quantitatively .",
    "we show that the emission from an ag(111 ) surface at threshold , at an angle of incidence near 60@xmath0 is dominated by the electrons emitted from the shockley surface state@xcite resulting in a qe of greater than @xmath1 very close to the photoemission threshold .",
    "we also calculate the rms transverse momentum of electrons emitted from the ag(111 ) surface .",
    "we show that the ag(111 ) surface can simultaneously provide a high qe and a low rms transverse momentum very close to the thermal limit@xcite and hence can be used as an excellent electron source .",
    "the dependence of qe on the polarization of incident light and angle of incidence is called the vectorial photoelectric effect and has been investigated experimentally , but has been modeled only empirically@xcite . using our scheme to calculate the qe",
    "we show that the vectorial photoelectric effect results from the variation of the overlap integral with the angle of incidence and polarization of incident light and can be modeled without use of any empirical data .",

    "in these equations , the term @xmath215 corresponds to the qe contribution of the @xmath2 component of the polarization vector and the term @xmath216 corresponds to the qe contribution of the @xmath45 component of the polarization vector . for the band structure and wave functions used here , @xmath217 . as a result",
    ", the photoemission from the ag(111 ) surface is dominated by the @xmath2 component of the polarization vector ( i.e component perpendicular to the surface ) . neglecting the contribution of the @xmath45 ( parallel to surface ) component",
    ", the qe can be written as @xmath218 where @xmath219 is a constant independent of the angle of incidence .",
    "note that both @xmath220 and @xmath221 are dependent on the angle of incidence .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows that the experimentally measured angular dependence of qe for @xmath61 polarized light matches this calculation .",
    "this dependence is similar to the angular dependence of qe measured for several materials@xcite .",
    "the spectral response calculated by the model at @xmath222 angle of incidence is much smaller than the experimental value ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) . at @xmath222 angle of incidence only the @xmath45 and @xmath46 components of the polarization vector exist .",
    "this implies that the experimentally observed contribution of the @xmath45 and @xmath46 components of of the polarization vector is larger than that calculated by the model .",
    "the assumption that the wave functions in the @xmath45 and @xmath46 directions are modeled by plane waves could be one possible culprit for this .",
    "emission from parts of the band structure not modeled by the nearly free electron representation , many body photoemission effects like the hole state lifetime induces energy spread@xcite and the breakdown of the sudden approximation@xcite are other effects which may be responsible for this discrepancy",
    ". they may also be responsible for the large effective scattering parameter .       making it a much better electron source than the current state - of - art .",
    "[ fig6],width=307 ]    figure [ fig6 ] shows the rms transverse momentum expected from the ag(111 ) surface .",
    "the rms transverse momentum has been calculated using equation [ rmsmom ] for angle of incidence equal to 60@xmath0 .",
    "it can be seen that the rms transvserse momentum initially decreases , reaches a minimum and then increases with increasing photon energy . at photon energies very close to threshold only electrons from the ring formed by the intersection of the surface state with the fermi level",
    "are emitted .",
    "these electrons have a relatively high transverse momentum . at higher photon energies , electrons from the surface state with lower transverse momentum and lower energy",
    "can also be emitted along with the electrons from the surface state ring at the fermi level .",
    "this causes the rms transverse momentum to initially reduce with increasing photon energy .",
    "this decline continues till the photon energy is sufficiently high to allow emission from the entire surface state . at this photon energy",
    "the rms momentum reaches a minimum . at higher photon energies ,",
    "the electrons from bulk states which are located near the fermi level and have a much higher transverse momentum are allowed to be emitted causing the rms transverse momentum to increase again .",
    "the smallest rms momentum measured from polycrystalline metal cathodes ( which are typically used as electron sources ) is limited by the room temperature to a value of @xmath223 ev / c@xcite at the photoemission threshold . however , at the photoemission threshold the qe is also very low ( in the @xmath224-@xmath225 ) range making polycrystalline cathodes unusable in this regime . at higher photon energies ,",
    "the qe increases but so does the rms transverse momentum . in order to obtain a desirable qe greater than 10@xmath226",
    "the photon energy used has to be several 100 mev above threshold .",
    "this sets the rms transverse momentum practically obtained in electron guns to @xmath227 ev / c@xcite . according to our calculations ,",
    "ag(111 ) when operated at an angle of incidence of 60@xmath0 in @xmath61 polarized light at 4.57 ev can act as a cathode with rms transverse momentum lower than 180 ev / c and a qe as high as @xmath1 .",
    "this shows that ag(111 ) can act as a better photocathode the polycrystalline metals currently used as electron sources .",
    "we have presented a 3-d one step model that allows us to calculate photoemission properties like qe and rms transverse momentum of emitted electrons from single crystal surfaces .",
    "optimizing these photoemission properties can greatly improve the performance of electron source applications like fels and ued .    using the example of photoemission from ag(111 )",
    "we show that not only can this model calculate the spectral response from surface state without the use of any ad hoc parameters , but also explains the photoemission phenomena of the vectorial photoelectric effect accurately .",
    "we also calculate the rms transverse momentum from an ag(111 ) surface and show that in @xmath61 polarized light with a high angle of incidence , the ag(111 ) surface can exhibit high qe along with a small rms transverse momentum , making it a much better cathode than the currently used polycrystalline metals . upon integrating with other band structure and wave function calculation techniques like density functional theory ,",
    "this methodology can be used to calculate the electron source relevant photoemission properties from any single crystal surface in order to identify ideal electron emitters from first principle calculations@xcite .",
    "such a methodology is essential to screen for materials to identify good electron emitters .",
