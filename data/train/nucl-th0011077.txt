    "one of the oldest problems in our understanding of collective motion of nuclei is the moments of inertia of ground state rotational bands in well deformed nuclei .",
    "they depend in a very sensitive way on the collective properties such as deformations and on pairing correlations of these many - body systems .",
    "since rotational bands have been detected in nuclei nearly fifty years ago and since the first microscopic calculations of the moments of inertia by inglis @xcite , these quantities have been used as a testing ground for nearly all microscopic theories of collective motion .",
    "they describe the response of the strongly interacting nuclear many - body system to an external coriolis field breaking time reversal symmetry .",
    "they are , therefore , in some sense comparable to the static magnetic susceptibility in condensed matter physics .",
    "the earliest microscopic calculations were based on a mean field of a deformed harmonic oscillator @xcite . in these calculations ,",
    "residual interactions were neglected . in this way one",
    "founds the values of the moments of inertia identical to those of a rigid body with the same shape , in strong disagreement with the experimentally observed values , which where considerably smaller .",
    "it has been pointed out already very early @xcite that residual two - body interactions would lower the values of the moment of inertia obtained in the inglis model .",
    "the most important correlations causing such a reduction are pairing correlations @xcite .",
    "in fact , belyaev @xcite showed that a simple extension of the inglis formula in the framework of the bcs theory is able to reduce the theoretical moments of inertia dramatically because of the large energy gap in the spectrum of quasiparticle excitations occurring in the denominator of the belyaev formula .",
    "therefore , the small moments of inertia of the rotational bands provided one of the most important experimental hints for a superfluid behaviour of these heavy open shell nuclei .",
    "extended calculations using the theory of belyaev have been carried out by nilsson and prior @xcite using the bcs model based on the single particle spectrum of the nilsson potential .    apart from the fact that the results of these calculations were relatively successful , there are , as we know today , a number of open problems , namely :    \\i ) belyaev s formula is based on generalized mean field theory violating essential symmetries . it was pointed out already by migdal @xcite , that galileian invariance is broken .",
    "he therefore modified the belyaev formula by taking into account more complicated correlations to correct the violation of this symmetry .",
    "the question of the restoration of the broken galileian invariance in the particle - hole and particle - particle channels has been later discussed in a number of articles , see for example refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "\\ii ) since belyaev s formula describes only quasiparticles moving independently , higher order correlations have to be taken into account .",
    "this has been done by thouless and valatin @xcite who considered all orders of the interaction in a theory describing the linear response of the system to the external coriolis field .",
    "marshalek and weneser @xcite showed that the method of thouless and valatin preserves all the symmetries violated in the mean field approximation in linear order . in that sense",
    "migdal s formula was just a special case to deal with galilean invariance .",
    "marshalek showed in a series of papers ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) that this is just the linear approximation of a more general theory based on boson expansion techniques treating the symmetries appropriately in all orders @xcite .",
    "\\iii ) much more elaborated versions of the cranked nilsson model @xcite showed that the @xmath0-term in this model , which corrects in an elegant way the fact that realistic potentials for heavy nuclei are much flatter than an oscillator in the nuclear interior , introduces a strong spurious momentum dependence .",
    "this leads to the values for the moments of inertia deviating considerably from the experimental values .",
    "however , this problem is to large extent cured either by strutinsky renormalization of the moments of inertia @xcite or by an additional term to the cranked nilsson potential that restores the local galilean invariance @xcite .",
    "realistic applications of the thouless - valatin theory are by no means trivial . they should be based on self - consistent solutions of the mean field equations , because only for those solutions the rpa theory preserves the symmetries @xcite . in addition , they require the inversion of the rpa - matrix .",
    "meyer - ter - vehn et al .",
    "@xcite have carried out such calculations in a restricted configuration space replacing the self - consistent mean field in an approximate way by the woods - saxon potential . as residual interaction they used density",
    "dependent migdal forces @xmath1 in the @xmath2-channel and @xmath3 in the @xmath4-channel .",
    "these interactions have been carefully adjusted to experimental data for the underlying configuration space .",
    "the results of these calculations showed , that there are indeed effects originating from both channels , each of them modifying the belyaev values , but cancelling themselves to a large extent .",
    "therefore one could understand why older calculations @xcite based on the generalized mean field model gave reasonable results as compared to the experiment .",
    "nowadays there are theories available where the hartree-(fock)-bogoliubov equations can be solved in a fully self - consistent way in the rotating frame for finite angular velocity @xmath5 . using the resulting wavefunctions @xmath6 the thouless - valatin moment of inertia can be found as @xmath7 in this way one avoids the inversion of the full rpa - matrix , as task which is so far technically impossible for realistic forces in a full configuration space . among these theories",
    "the properties of rotating nuclei are described in a way free from adjustable parameters only in the cranked relativistic hartree - bogoliubov ( crhb ) theory @xcite and non - relativistic density - dependent cranked hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( chfb ) theory with finite range gogny forces @xcite .",
    "several realistic investigations of the moments of inertia in normal- and in super - deformed bands have been carried out in the literature in the framework of non - relativistic chfb theory with gogny forces @xcite .",
    "similar investigations in the relativistic framework have been performed without pairing in the @xmath8 @xcite , 80 @xcite and @xmath9 @xcite regions of superdeformation where the pairing correlations are expected to be considerably quenched at high spin .",
    "the recently developed formalism of the crhb theory has been applied so far only for the description of the moments of inertia in the @xmath10 mass region of superdeformation @xcite .",
    "a very successful description of the moments of inertia has been obtained in the framework of these two theories .",
    "the aim of the present investigation is to find the similarities and differences between these two theories using in a systematic way the moments of inertia of rare - earth nuclei as a testing ground .",
    "the crhb theory @xcite is an extension of cranked relativistic mean field theory @xcite to the description of pairing correlations in rotating nuclei .",
    "it describes the nucleus as a system of dirac nucleons which interact in a relativistic covariant manner through the exchange of virtual mesons @xcite : the isoscalar scalar @xmath11 meson , the isoscalar vector @xmath12 meson , and the isovector vector @xmath13 meson .",

    "the results of relativistic and non - relativistic calculations with and without apnp(ln ) are presented in tables 1 - 3 and figs . 1 - 2 and compared with the experiment .",
    "such quantities as charge quadrupole moments [ deformations ] , pairing energies and moments of inertia are discussed below .",
    "the calculated and experimental charge quadrupole moments @xmath65 and quadrupole deformation parameters @xmath66 derived from @xmath65 by @xmath67 are shown in table 1 and fig .",
    "the general feature is that the charge quadrupole moments @xmath65 obtained in relativistic calculations are larger than the ones of the non - relativistic calculations . in the non - relativistic case ,",
    "the @xmath65 values calculated with apnp(ln ) are slightly smaller than the ones obtained without apnp(ln ) because of the larger pairing correlations ( see table 2 ) , which in general favours more spherical configurations .",
    "this trend also persists in the relativistic case , but there are the cases ( @xmath68er , @xmath68yb ) in which apnp(ln ) leads to larger charge quadrupole moments as compared with unprojected calculations . as shown in fig .",
    "1 , the non - relativistic results are somewhat closer to the experiment than the relativistic ones . however , considering that the experimental values of @xmath65 are subject of considerable experimental errors @xcite , one can conclude that both theories describe experimental charge quadrupole moments reasonable well which allows us to proceed further with the study of more sensitive quantities such as moments of inertia .    in hartree-(fock)-bogoliubov calculations the size of the pairing correlations",
    "is usually measured in terms of the pairing energy defined as @xmath69 this is not an experimentally accessible quantity , but it is a measure for the size of the pairing correlations in the theoretical calculations .",
    "these quantities are shown in table 2 and fig .  2 for protons and neutrons separately .",
    "both in relativistic and non - relativistic calculations , we observe that apnp(ln ) leads to an increase of the pairing energies .",
    "this increase shows large variations as a function of the proton and neutron numbers . in general",
    ", this increase is larger in relativistic calculations .",
    "for example , proton pairing energies increase on average by factor 2.16 ( with minimal and maximal increase being equal to 1.53 ( @xmath70dy ) and 3.36 ( @xmath71gd ) ) . in non - relativistic calculations ,",
    "the average increase of proton pairing energies is only 1.55 ( with minimal and maximal increase being equal to 1.11 ( @xmath70dy ) and 1.97 ( @xmath72yb ) ) .",
    "neutron pairing energies behave in a similar way but there the difference between relativistic and non - relativistic calculations is smaller : the average increase of neutron pairing energies due to apnp(ln ) is 1.81 in the relativistic and 1.73 in the non - relativistic calculations . in some cases , as for example in the gd isotopes , the increase of neutron pairing energies due to apnp(ln ) is larger in non - relativistic calculations .",
    "this increase of pairing energies due to apnp(ln ) will lead to an increase of the pairing gaps , as it is well known from many phenomenological calculations using the monopole pairing force @xcite .",
    "we also see that with few exceptions the pairing energies are smaller in relativistic calculations .",
    "an additional effect of apnp(ln ) is the increase of absolute values of binding energies . in relativistic calculations , apnp(ln )",
    "provides an additional binding by @xmath73 mev .    calculated",
    "moments of inertia are given in table 3 and fig .",
    "1 . comparing the results of calculations without apnp(ln ) , it is clear that the moments of inertia are systematically larger in the relativistic case .",
    "although one can not completely exclude that this feature is to some extent connected with a different angular momentum content of single - particle orbitals in relativistic and non - relativistic calculations , a detailed analysis of pairing energies and moments of inertia suggests that this fact can be explained in a more realistic way by the different effective masses of the two theories : @xmath74 in rmf theory and @xmath75 in the non - relativistic theory .",
    "thus the corresponding level density in the vicinity of the fermi level is smaller in the relativistic theory which in general leads to weaker pairing correlations ( see table 2 and discussion above ) as compared with non - relativistic calculations and as a result to larger moments of inertia .",
    "apnp(ln ) restores to large extent the correct size of pairing correlations and thus its effect is larger in relativistic calculations .",
    "the average decrease of the moments of inertia due to apnp(ln ) over the considered set of nuclei is 1.35 and 1.15 in relativistic and non - relativistic calculations , respectively .",
    "it is also clearly seen that apnp(ln ) improves in average and especially in relativistic case the agreement between experimental and calculated moments of inertia .",
    "the level of agreement between calculations with apnp(ln ) and experiment is similar in both theories , however , some discrepancies still remain .",
    "in conclusion , the moments of inertia , charge quadrupole moments and pairing energies of well - deformed nuclei in the rare - earth region have been investigated within relativistic and non - relativistic mean field theories with and without approximate particle number projection by means of the lipkin - nogami method . with no adjustable parameters it was possible to obtain good description of experimental data .",
    "it was found that the particle number projection plays a more important role in the relativistic calculations most likely reflecting the lower effective mass .",
    "in addition , it has larger impact on the moments of inertia and the pairing energies as compared with the charge quadrupole moments .",
    "remaining deviations from experimental data could be related either to the parametrization of the mean field or to the interaction in the pairing channel or to the approximate character of the particle number projection . further and",
    "more systematic investigations are needed for clarification of the main source of discrepancies between theory and experiment .",
