    "a quantity of interest for applications is the mean number @xmath6 of distinct sites visited up to time @xmath0 by a single random walker .",
    "it evidently grows as @xmath7 when @xmath8 .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour for @xmath9 was obtained by dvoretzky and erds @xcite with @xmath10 at the critical dimension @xmath11 and @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "exact values of the amplitudes on different lattices in @xmath14 and sub - dominant contributions were later calculated @xcite .",
    "many other observables associated with the geometry of the support ( i.e. the set of visited sites ) of a random walk and their fluctuations have been studied more recently @xcite .",
    "the peculiarity of the dimension @xmath15 was first noticed by polya @xcite who showed that , with probability 1 , a random walker returns infinitely often to the origin when @xmath16 and escape to infinity when @xmath13 .",
    "this property is linked to the value of the fractal dimension of the random walk , @xmath17 .",
    "instead of considering a single random walk , one may generalise to the case of @xmath4 statistically independent random walks starting from the same point .",
    "such studies were first concerned with the properties of first passage times @xcite .",
    "the study of the number of distinct sites visited by @xmath4 random walkers , @xmath18 , was initiated in  @xcite where asymptotic expressions for @xmath4 large were obtained . in  @xcite some corrections to  @xcite",
    "were given and sub - dominant contributions were evaluated .    the mean value of another interesting observable , @xmath19 , the mean number of common sites visited by @xmath4 random walkers up to time @xmath0 , was studied in  @xcite where the asymptotic behaviour at long time was determined .",
    "quite recently , exact expressions for the probability distributions of the number of distinct sites and the number of common sites visited by @xmath4 random walkers starting from the same origin have been obtained in @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "following the work of majumdar and tamm  @xcite , we have shown how the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath19 can be simply obtained exploiting the notion of fractal intersection  @xcite .",
    "the rule governing the fractal dimension @xmath20 of the intersection of @xmath4 statistically independent and isotropic fractals with dimensions @xmath21 , embedded in euclidean space with dimension @xmath3 , is the following @xcite d_f(n)=d-,= , [ dfiso ] where @xmath22 is the co - dimension @xcite .",

    "the typical size at time @xmath0 is @xmath25 and the dimension of the intersection follows from   with @xmath17 .    in the present work we study the mean number of encounters up to time @xmath0 , @xmath1 , of @xmath4 independent random walkers starting from a common origin at @xmath26 .",
    "the events in space - time , corresponding to the meeting of the @xmath4 random walkers , take place at the intersection of the @xmath4 fractals associated with the support of the random walks  @xcite . since , when considered in space - time , a random walk is a strongly anisotropic fractal object , the scaling behaviour of @xmath1 at long time is governed by the fractal dimension of the intersection of @xmath4 strongly anisotropic fractals .",
    "a fractal object is strongly anisotropic when its growth in different directions is governed by different exponents , @xmath27 .",
    "the random walk in space - time , with a dynamical exponent @xmath28 , is one of the simplest examples .",
    "such a behaviour is not uncommon , it is observed in different contexts among which one may mention directed systems  @xcite , lifshitz points  @xcite and some quantum critical points  @xcite , critical dynamics  @xcite and non - equilibrium phase transitions  @xcite .",

    "the rule giving the dimension of the intersection of strongly anisotropic fractals is established , generalising  .",
    "then the notion of fractal intersection is used to evaluate the long - time behaviour of @xmath1 . in the final section",
    ", we formulate some remarks and present possible extensions .",
    "we consider @xmath4 random walkers performing discrete , statistically independent random walks on a @xmath3dimensional hyper - cubic lattice @xmath31 with lattice parameter @xmath32 .",
