    "quantum key distribution ( qkd ) allows two authenticated parties , normally referred to as alice and bob , to generate a secure key through an insecure quantum channel controlled by an eavesdropper , eve @xcite .",
    "based on fundamental laws in quantum mechanics , idealized qkd protocols have been proved to be unconditionally secure against adversaries with unlimited computing power and technological capabilities @xcite .",
    "both discrete - variable ( dv ) qkd protocols based on single photon detection @xcite and continuous - variable ( cv ) qkd protocols based on coherent detection @xcite have been demonstrated as viable solutions in practice .",
    "one well - known cv - qkd protocol is the gaussian - modulated coherent state ( gmcs ) protocol @xcite , which has been demonstrated through an @xmath3 km optical fiber link recently @xcite .",
    "one important advantage of the gmcs qkd is its robustness against incoherent background noise .",
    "the strong local oscillator ( lo ) employed in coherent detection also acts as a natural and extremely selective filter , which can suppress noise photons effectively .",
    "this intrinsic filtering function makes cv - qkd an appealing solution for secure key distribution over a noisy channel , such as a lit fiber in a conventional fiber optic network @xcite or a free - space optical link @xcite .",
    "however , all existing implementations of cv - qkd based on coherent detection contain a serious weakness : to reduce the phase noise , both the signal and the lo are generated from the same laser and propagate through the insecure quantum channel @xcite .",
    "this arrangement has several limitations .",
    "first of all , it allows eve to access both the quantum signal and the lo .",
    "eve may launch sophisticated attacks by manipulating the lo , as demonstrated in recent studies @xcite .",
    "second , sending a strong lo through a lossy channel can drastically reduce the efficiency of qkd in certain applications .",
    "for example , to achieve a shot - noise limited coherent detection , the required photon number in the lo is typically above @xmath4 photons per pulse at the receiver s end @xcite . with a @xmath5 ghz pulse repetition rate and a channel loss of @xmath6 db ,",
    "the required lo power at the input of the quantum channel is about @xmath7 w ( at @xmath8 nm ) .",
    "if optical fiber is used as the quantum channel , noise photons generated by the strong lo inside the optical fiber may significantly reduce qkd efficiency and multiplexing capacity .",
    "third , the lo is typically @xmath9 or @xmath10 orders of magnitude brighter than the quantum signal , complicated multiplexing and demultiplexing schemes are required to effectively separate the lo from the quantum signal at the receiver s end .    in brief , in cv - qkd , it is desirable to generate the lo `` locally '' using an independent laser source at the receiver s end . unfortunately , such a scheme has never been implemented in practice .",
    "the main challenge is how to effectively establish a reliable phase reference between alice and bob .",
    "while various techniques , such as feedforward carrier recovery @xcite , optical phase - locked loops @xcite , and optical injection phase - lock loop @xcite , have been developed in classical coherent communication , these techniques are not suitable in qkd where the quantum signal is extremely weak and the tolerable phase noise is low .",
    "furthermore , to prevent eve from manipulating the lo , the lo laser should be isolated from outside both optically and electrically .    in this paper , we solve the above long outstanding problem by proposing and demonstrating a pilot - aided feedforward data recovery scheme , which enables reliable coherent detection using a `` locally '' generated lo .",
    "this scheme is built upon the observation that in the gmcs qkd , bob does not need to perform the measurement in the `` correct basis '' .",
    "in fact , bob can perform the measurement in an arbitrarily rotated basis as along as the basis information ( the phase reference ) is available afterwards . with this post - measurement basis information",
    ", either alice or bob can rotate data at hand and generate correlated data with the other .",
    "we demonstrate the above scheme in a coherent communication system constructed by a spool of @xmath0 km optical fiber and two independent commercial laser sources operated at free - running mode .",
    "the observed phase - noise variance is @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) , which is small enough to enable secure key distribution .",
    "this technology also opens the door for other novel quantum communication protocols , such as the measurement - device - independent ( mdi ) cv - qkd protocol @xcite where independent light sources are employed by different users .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec:2 ] , we conduct a theoretical analysis of the proposed scheme . in section [ sec:3 ] ,",
    "we present the details of proof - of - principle experiments .",
    "we conclude this paper with a discussion in section [ sec:4 ] .",
    "in gmcs qkd , alice draws two random numbers @xmath11 and @xmath12 from a set of gaussian random numbers ( with a mean of zero and a variance of @xmath13 ) , prepares a coherent state @xmath14 accordingly , and sends it to bob . here @xmath15 = 1/4 denotes the shot - noise variance . at bob s end",
    ", he can perform either optical homodyne detection or optical heterodyne detection .    in gmcs qkd protocol based on homodyne detection @xcite ,",
    "bob randomly chooses to measure either the amplitude quadrature ( x ) or phase quadrature ( p ) of the incoming signal .",
    "later on , he announces which quadrature he measures for each incoming signal through an authenticated public channel , and alice only keeps the corresponding data . in gmcs",
    "qkd based on heterodyne detection @xcite , bob first splits the incoming signal into two with a 50:50 beam splitter .",
    "he then measures x at one output port and p at the other . in this case",
    ", alice keeps all her quadrature data .    after the quantum transmission stage , alice shares a set of correlated gaussian random variables ( called the``raw key '' ) with bob .",
    "alice and bob compare a random sample of the raw key through an authenticated classical channel to estimate the transmittance and excess noise of the quantum channel .",
    "if the observed excess noise is small enough , they can further work out a secure key .    in the above description",
    ", we have implicitly assumed that alice and bob share a phase reference , so bob can perform the required quadrature measurement .",
    "if the lo is generated for an independent laser source , how can alice and bob establish a phase reference in this case ?    in this section ,",
    "we present a pilot - aided phase estimation scheme which allows alice and bob to measure the phase relation between two independent lasers in real time . using this phase information",
    "either alice or bob can rotate the data at hand in the post - processing stage ( `` quadrature remapping '' ) and establish correlation with the other . in principle , our scheme can be applied to both cv - qkd with homodyne detection and the one with heterodyne detection . in this paper , we focus on the case of heterodyne detection . for an independent and related work ,",
    "see @xcite .      in a phase coding dv - qkd protocol , it is also crucial to control the phase between a signal pulse and a reference pulse when performing interferometric measurement .",
    "in fact , a dv - qkd protocol using a strong phase - reference pulse has been proposed in @xcite . in this scheme",
    ", alice sends bob a quantum signal together with a strong phase reference pulse generated from the same laser . at bob s side",
    ", he interferes the strong phase reference pulse with a sampling beam from his lo laser to determine the phase difference between the two lasers , corrects this phase difference by introducing a phase shift to his lo laser , and then performs an interfeometric measurement on the quantum signal using the phase - corrected lo pulse .",
    "however , the above scheme has not been demonstrated yet , possibly due to the following reasons : first , the phase difference between two remote independent lasers is expected to fluctuate rapidly , this makes real - time phase feedback control very challenging .",
    "secondly , different types of detector are required for phase measurement and quantum signal detection , this increases the complexity of the overall system .",
    "as we will show below , the above two challenges can be overcome in a cv - qkd protocol .",
    "suppose in a cv - qkd system based on heterodyne detection , both the signal laser and the lo laser are operated in free - running mode .",
    "without loss of generality , for each transmission , we can choose the phase of the signal laser as the phase reference ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "when bob performs conjugated homodyne detection , the phase @xmath17 of his lo laser can be treated as a random variable .",
    "bob s measurement results @xmath18 are given by ( after scaling with the channel transmittance ) [ eq1 ] x_b & = & x_a cos+p_a sin+n_x + p_b & = & -x_a sin+p_a cos+n_p where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are assumed to be i.i.d .",
    "gaussian noises with zero mean .",
    "if alice and bob can determine @xmath17 after bob has performed his measurement , one of them ( for example , bob ) can use this post - measurement phase information to correct his data by performing the following rotation [ eq2 ] x^_b & = & x_b cos - p_b sin + p^_b & = & x_b sin+p_b cos    from equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , it is easy to show [ eq3 ] x^_b & = & x_a+n^_x + p^_b & = & p_a+n^_p where the noise terms in the rotated data are given by [ eq4 ] n^_x & = & n_x cos - n_p sin + n^_p & = & n_x sin+n_p cos    given @xmath19 and @xmath20 are i.i.d .",
    "gaussian noises , it is easy to see that @xmath21 and @xmath22 are also independent gaussian noises with the same variance as @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "this suggests that the rotation process will not introduce additional noise if the phase @xmath17 can be determined precisely .",
    "the above `` quadrature remapping '' scheme allows alice and bob to establish correlated data without using a complicated phase feedback control system , thus removing the first challenge listed at the beginning of this section .",
    "next , we will present a scheme which allows alice and bob to determine @xmath17 under * realistic * scenarios using the * same * detector for quantum signal detection , thus removing the second challenge listed above .",
    "if the drift of phase @xmath17 is slow enough such that within a frame time of @xmath23 ( within which the phase @xmath17 can be treated as a constant ) , many rounds of quantum transmission can be conducted , the following scheme can be applied to estimate the phase @xmath17 .",
    "after the quantum transmission stage , for each frame , alice can randomly choose a subset of the transmitted signals as calibration pulses and announce the encoded data through an authenticated channel . using the corresponding measurement results at hand , bob can estimate phase @xmath17 for this frame using equation ( 1 ) . since alice s signals are at quantum level , each individual calibration pulse can not provide a precise estimation of the phase @xmath17 .",
    "however , by averaging the results acquired from a large number of calibration pulses , the phase noise can be reduced effectively .",
    "this scheme was first proposed and implemented in @xcite to reduce the noise associated with the slow phase drift of a fiber interferometer in gmcs qkd .",
    "unfortunately , the above scheme is not practical when the quantum signals and the los are generated from independent laser sources . on one hand",
    ", the phase difference between two practical lasers fluctuates rapidly due to the laser frequency instability and the phase noise associated with the finite laser linewidth ; on the other hand , the maximum transmission rate of cv - qkd is limited by the bandwidth of shot - noise limited optical coherent detector . as such , we can not acquire an accurate estimation of @xmath17 by measuring quantum signals .    to solve the above problem",
    ", we proposed a pilot - aided feedforward data recovery scheme @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is as follows . for each quantum transmission",
    ", alice sends out both a quantum signal and a relatively strong phase reference pulse generated from the same laser .",
    "the quantum signal carries alice s random numbers , as in the case of conventional cv - qkd . the reference pulse , on the other hand",
    ", is not modulated .",
    "these two pulses propagate through the same quantum channel to the measurement device , where bob performs conjugate homodyne detection on both of them using los generated from the lo laser .",
    "note , to avoid detector saturation , bob can use a relatively weak lo to measure the reference pulse .",
    "the measurement results from the phase reference pulse @xmath24 can be used to determine @xmath17 using [ eq5 ] = -tan^-1where the minus sign is due to the definition of phase reference . by using a relatively strong reference pulse",
    ", bob can acquire an accurate estimation of @xmath17 and use this phase information to implement the quadrature remapping scheme .    in this paper , we study a simple implementation of the above scheme , where alice sends out quantum signals and reference pulses alternately and periodically , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "we remark that if the drift of phase @xmath17 is slow enough compared with the transmission rate of qkd , it is possible to use fewer reference pulses to improve qkd efficiency .    ) and reference pulses ( @xmath25 ) . ]    in fig.1 , a quantum signal @xmath26 and the corresponding reference pulse @xmath27 are measured at different times with a time delay of @xmath28 . if the frequency difference of the two lasers @xmath29 is a constant and can be precisely determined , we can estimate phase @xmath30 at the time when @xmath26 is measured from the phase measurement result of @xmath27 by simply adding a constant phase shift of @xmath31 . in practice , however , both lasers present slow frequency drift over time . here",
    ", we use a simple scheme to estimate @xmath30 .",
    "since the signal pulse @xmath26 is in the middle of two reference pulses @xmath27 and @xmath32 , we can estimate @xmath30 from the phase measurement results on @xmath27 and @xmath32 as [ eq6 ] _ s , i=    note the above equation can also be written as [ eq7 ] _ s , i=_r , i+2_d t_d where @xmath33 can be interpreted as the frequency difference of the two lasers within the short time interval between two adjacent reference pulses .    while similar to classical intradyne detection , a key difference in our scheme separates phase recovery of a quantum signal from that of a classical one .",
    "a phase reference can not be recovered reliably from a quantum signal while it can in the classical case , meaning that the reference pulses here must be used to estimate that phase of the lo and quantum signal during the time window in which the quantum signal arrives .",
    "this places additional stringent requirements on relative laser noise compared to the classical case .      in this section",
    ", we will show that the existing security proofs of conventional cv - qkd @xcite ( built upon the assumption that eve can only access the quantum signals ) can be applied in our scheme directly .",
    "first , the phase reference pulses are only used to provide ( classical ) phase information , they are not directly used in the coherent detection of the quantum signals .",
    "in fact , in our scheme eve can never access the lo itself .",
    "note , a standard assumption in cv - qkd is that eve can have full knowledge of the phase reference used in quantum state preparation / coherent detection , so the reference pulses will not give eve any additional information .",
    "eve can certainly interfere with the phase recovery process by manipulating the phase reference pulses when they propagate through the quantum channel .",
    "this could result in an increased phase noise and the secure key rate will be reduced .",
    "this is one type of denial - of - service attack , which can be applied to any qkd protocols . from eve",
    "s point of view , whatever can be achieved by manipulating the reference pulses can also be achieved by manipulating the quantum signals directly . in brief , sending phase reference pulses through the quantum channel will not cause any security problem .",
    "next , we will show the security of the cv - qkd protocol using quadrature remapping scheme is equivalent to that of the conventional cv - qkd protocol . to illustrate the essential ideas , it is convenient to represent the phase recovery scheme by a separate classical communication channel , which can be fully controlled by eve .",
    "fig.2 ( a ) is a schematic diagram of bob s system in our new qkd scheme .",
    "in this picture , bob performs a heterodyne measurement on the incoming quantum signal , then rotates his measurement results using the phase @xmath17 estimated through the classical communication channel . in @xcite",
    ", the authors proved that a unitary phase rotation commutes with heterodyne detection .",
    "more specifically , bob can either rotate the optical phase of the quantum signal first , then perform heterodyne detection , or he can perform heterodyne detection first , then rotate the classical measurement results in the post - processing stage .",
    "so the protocol shown in fig.2 ( a ) is equivalent to the virtual qkd protocol shown in fig.2 ( b ) .",
    "since the classical phase estimation channel can be controlled by eve , we can move the phase rotation operator out of bob s secure station and let eve to have full control of it , as shown in fig.2 ( c ) .",
    "note the qkd protocol shown in fig.2 ( c ) is exactly the conventional cv - qkd based on heterodyne detection , where eve is allowed to manipulate the quantum signals transmitted through the channel at her will .",
    "so , the security of our new qkd scheme is equivalent to that of the conventional cv - qkd protocol .        while we do not need to develop a new security proof for the proposed qkd scheme , to achieve a high secure key rate , it is important to reduce the noise of the phase recovery process . from eq .",
    ", the uncertainty of @xmath17 will be translated into an excess noise in @xmath34 ( after scaling with the channel transmittance ) as [ eq8 ] _ = v_a _ where @xmath35 is alice s modulation variance , @xmath36 is the noise variance in determining phase @xmath17 .",
    "this extra noise @xmath37 will reduce secure key generation rate .",
    "it is thus very important to minimize the phase noise @xmath36 .    in next section",
    ", we will study the performance of the proposed phase recovery scheme under realistic scenario .",
    "there are two major noise sources in determining phase @xmath17 using eq.(6 ) .",
    "the first one is the measurement noise when bob tries to determine @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) of the reference pulses @xmath27 ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "this noise could be significant when the reference pulses become extremely weak thus the contribution of shot noise can not be ignored .",
    "however , in practice , we can use a relative strong reference pulse to reduce the contribution of the shot noise .",
    "for example , if the average photon number of the reference pulse ( at bob s heterodyne detector ) is @xmath40 , given the detection efficiency of the heterordyne detector is @xmath41 , the phase noise variance due to the shot noise is about @xmath42 , which is negligible in practice . in this paper",
    ", we simply ignore this noise contribution .",
    "the second noise source is the quantum phase noise of the laser , which originates from the amplified spontaneous emission .",
    "more specifically , even we know the phase of the reference pulse , we still can not determine the phase of the signal pulse precisely since they are generated at different times .",
    "the spontaneous emitted photons generated within the above time interval contribute a fundamental phase noise .",
    "since the laser phase noise can not be reduced by simply increasing the amplitude of the reference pulse , it is the main noise source in our scheme .",
    "define the laser phase at time @xmath43 as @xmath44 .",
    "the phase noise @xmath45 quantifies the deviation of the laser phase at time @xmath46 from @xmath47 ( the phase expected from an ideal @xmath48 wave ) , where @xmath49 is the central frequency of the laser .",
    "@xmath45 can be modeled as a gaussian random variable with a mean of zero and a variance of @xcite [ eq9 ] ( ( t))^2=. here @xmath50 is the coherence time of the laser .",
    "for a laser with lorentzian lineshape , @xmath50 is related to its linewidth @xmath51 by @xcite [ eq10 ] _",
    "c.    as shown in appendix a , given the phase noise of the signal laser and that of the lo laser are @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively , the noise variance of our phase estimation scheme ( eq.(6 ) ) is described by [ eq11 ] _ = ( _ s(t_d))^2 + ( _ l(t_d))^2 , where @xmath28 is the time delay between the signal pulse and the reference pulse ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "we demonstrate the pilot - aided feedforward data recovery scheme using commercial off - the - shelf devices .",
    "the experimental setup is shown in fig.3 .",
    "two commercial frequency - stabilized continuous wave ( cw ) lasers at telecom wavelength ( clarity - nll-1542-hp from wavelength reference ) are employed as the signal and the lo laser .",
    "both lasers are operated at free - running mode with no optical or electrical connections between them .",
    "the central frequency difference between the two lasers can stay within @xmath54 mhz without doing any feedback controls .",
    "a linbo3 waveguide intensity modulator ( eospace ) is used to generate @xmath10 ns laser pulses at a repetition rate of @xmath55 mhz . since half of the laser pulses are used as phase references , the equivalent data transmission rate in our experiment is @xmath0 mhz . a linbo3 waveguide phase modulator ( eospace )",
    "is used to modulate the phase of the signal pulses .",
    "both the signal pulses and the reference pulses propagate through a spool of 25 km single mode fiber before arriving at the measurement device . a commercial @xmath56 optical hybrid ( optoplex ) and two @xmath57 mhz balanced amplified photodetectors ( thorlabs ) are employed to measure both x - quadrature and p - quadrature of the incoming pulses .",
    "the @xmath56 optical hybrid is a passive device featuring a compact design .",
    "no temperature control is required to stabilize its internal interferometers .",
    "the outputs of the two balanced photodetectors are sampled by a broadband oscilloscope at @xmath5 ghz sampling rate . for simplicity ,",
    "the lo laser is operated at the cw mode .",
    "a waveform generator with a bandwidth of @xmath58 mhz provides the modulation signals to both the intensity and the phase modulator , and a synchronization signal to the oscilloscope .      to evaluate the effectiveness of the phase recovery scheme , we conduct a phase encoding coherent communication experiment using a binary pattern of `` 01010101 ... '' , where bit 0 is represented by no phase shift and bit 1 by phase shift of @xmath59 . the phase modulator shown in fig.3",

    "this suggests the excess noise of the detector ( including noise from the commercial balanced photo - detector and the oscilloscope ) is about @xmath82 in shot - noise units .",
    "note , due to the residual phase noise of the phase recovery scheme , the distribution shown in the right figure is not symmetric : the variance of p - quadrature ( @xmath83 ) is larger than that of x - quadrature ( @xmath84 ) .",

    "the quantum signals are extremely weak and the modulation scheme is more complicated , the carrier phase can not be recovered from the quantum signals reliably .",

    "second , the transmission rate of a classical communication system can reach 100ghz , while the transmission rate of a state - of - the - art gmcs qkd system is below 100mhz .",
    "this places a more stringent requirement on laser phase noise in the quantum system .",
    "third , a classical digital communication system can tolerate higher phase noise than the cv - qkd . in brief",
    ", it is much more challenging to recover carrier phase in quantum communication .",
    "although a complete cv - qkd experiment using the proposed scheme is not presented in this paper , all the components required to implement such a system , including broadband shot - noise limited homodyne detectors @xcite , have been well developed .",
    "in fact , the structure of the proposed qkd system is much simpler compared to the conventional scheme @xcite .",
    "we remark that a similar cv - qkd scheme has been independently proposed by soh _",
    "_ @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "soh _ et al .",
