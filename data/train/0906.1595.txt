    "the fu orionis systems are a small but remarkable class of young stellar objects which undergo outbursts in optical light of 5 magnitudes or more @xcite . while the rise times for outbursts are usually very short ( @xmath0 ) , the decay timescales range from decades to centuries . in outbursts ,",
    "they exhibit f - g supergiant optical spectra and k - m supergiant near - infrared spectra dominated by deep co overtone absorption",
    ". the fu ori objects also show distinctive reflection nebulae , large infrared excesses of radiation , wavelength dependent spectral types , and `` double - peaked '' absorption line profiles @xcite . the accretion disk model for fu ori objects proposed by hartmann @xmath1 kenyon ( 1985 , 1987a , 1987b ) and",
    "@xcite can explain the peculiarities enumerated above in a straightforward manner .",
    "bell @xmath1 lin ( 1994 ) suggested that the thermal instability ( ti ) was responsible for fu ori outbursts . to agree with the outburst mass accretion rates ( @xmath2 ) and the outburst duration time ( @xmath3 yr ) , with the ti , bell @xmath1 lin used very low viscosities both before and after the outbursts .",
    "however , this theory predicts that the outburst is confined to inner disk radii @xmath4 , whereas zhu et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2008 ) found that the high accretion rate region must extend to @xmath5 , based on modeling _ spitzer _",
    "irs data .",
    "@xcite suggested that a binary companion on an eccentric orbit could perturb the disk and cause repeated outbursts of accretion .",
    "however , in the case of fu ori , no close companion is known , and no radial velocity variation has been detected @xcite .",
    "vorobyov @xmath1 basu ( 2005 , 2006 ) suggested that gravitational instabilities might produce the non - steady accretion , but could not carry out the calculation within the inner disk ; thus the details of the accretion event are uncertain .",
    "@xcite suggested that planets might dam up disk material until a certain point , resulting in outbursts .",
    "this model also depends upon the ti and assumes a very low viscosity as in bell @xmath1 lin ( 1994 ) .",
    "the rediscovery and application of the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) to disk angular momentum transport have revolutionized our understanding of accretion in ionized disks ( e.g. balbus @xmath1 hawley 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "however , it was recognized that t tauri disks are cold and thus likely to have such low ionization levels that the mri can not operate , at least in some regions of the disk ( e.g. , reyes - ruiz @xmath1 stepinski 1995 ) .",
    "gammie ( 1996 ) suggested that nonthermal ionization by cosmic rays could lead to accretion in upper disk layers , with a `` dead zone '' in the midplane .",
    "this picture implies that accretion is not steady throughout the disk , and the mass should pile up at small radii .",
    "@xcite considered the time evolution of layered disks including angular momentum transport by the gravitational instability ( gi ) . within a certain range of mass addition by infall in the outer disk",
    ", they obtained episodic outbursts of accretion at @xmath6 lasting @xmath7 yr .",
    "however , these outbursts are too weak and last too long compared with fu ori outbursts .",
    "gammie ( 1999 ) and book & hartmann ( 2004 ) were able to get outbursts more like fu ori behavior with a different set of parameters .",
    "the armitage , gammie , book & hartmann models were vertically averaged and had schematic treatments of radial energy transport .    earlier models of layered disk evolution have been based on phenomenological one - zone , or two - zone , models for the vertical structure of the disk . it is quite difficult to formulate these models in a consistent way , particularly near transition radii where the temperature or ionization structure of the disk changes sharply and radial energy transport may be important . to make progress it is necessary to consider more accurate vertical structure and more accurate energy transport models .    in this paper ,",
    "we construct two - dimensional ( axisymmetric ) layered disk models .",
    "we find that the mri triggering by the gi can explain fu ori - type outbursts if the mri is thermally activated at t@xmath8@xmath91200 k. in  2 , the equations and methods of the 2d models are introduced . in  3 , outburst behavior is described . in  4 , we focus on vertical structure and convection in the disk .",
    "we discuss implications of the 2d simulations compared with observations in  5 , and summarize our results in  6 .",
    "in this work we are particularly interested in accurately modeling the flow of energy within the disk .",
    "a full treatment would numerically follow the development of mri , gi , and radiative , convective , and chemical energy transport in 3d . as this is not yet possible",
    ", we use the phenomenological @xmath10-based viscosity to represent the angular momentum transport by the mri and gi and heating by dissipation of turbulence .",
    "an accurate treatment of energy balance ( viscous heating and radiative cooling ) is essential to understand the outburst , especially for the thermal instability .",
    "we implemented the realistic radiative cooling in the zeus - type code of @xcite .    to test our code",
    ", we set a hot region in an optically thick disk region and then let the radiative energy diffuse without evolving the hydrodynamics .",
    "the hot region expands nicely in a round shape in r - z space with the correct flux .",
    "we have also tested the total energy conservation during our outburst simulations , finding that the energy deficit during outburst is only @xmath11  1% of the total energy radiated .      the momentum equation and energy equations are @xmath12 @xmath13 here , as usual , @xmath14 is the lagrangian time derivative , @xmath15 is the mass density , @xmath16 is the velocity , @xmath17 is the internal energy density of the gas , @xmath18 is the gas pressure , @xmath19 is the gravitational potential , and @xmath20 is the radiative cooling rate .",
    "the dissipation function @xmath21 is given by the product of the anomalous stress tensor @xmath22 with the rate - of - strain tensor @xmath23 , @xmath24 ( sum over indices ) , where the anomalous stress tensor is the term - by - term product @xmath25 ( no sum over indices ) , where @xmath26 is a symmetric matrix filled with 0 or 1 that serves as a switch for each component of the anomalous stress . in current simulations , we switched on all the component of the anomalous stress .",
    "it is not yet known whether any prescription for @xmath27 is a good approximation for modeling mhd turbulence .",
    "we set the viscosity coefficient to @xmath28 , which vanishes rapidly near the poles @xcite .",
    "@xmath10 is the viscosity parameter and @xmath29 is the angular velocity at radius @xmath30 .",
    "the equation of state is @xmath31 and the sound speed is @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the adiabatic index and the mean molecular weight .",
    "we assume @xmath35 and @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the mass of one proton .",
    "the adiabatic index and mean molecular weight will change at different temperatures and pressure ( especially during outburst when the disk is fully ionized ) and a fully self - consistent treatment would use a tabulated equation of state .",
    "we will discuss a more realistic equation of state in a later paper .      in an accretion disk",
    ", radiation is the main cooling mechanism , and radiation energy and pressure can affect the disk dynamics . numerically , there are two different approaches to treat the radiative transport in an accretion disk .",
    "one is to solve the full radiative transfer equation @xmath38 with the material energy equation : @xmath39 in both the optically thick and thin regions by an implicit method @xcite . here ,",
    "as above , @xmath15,@xmath17,@xmath16 , and @xmath18 are the gas mass density , energy density , velocity and scalar isotropic pressure respectively , while e , f , and p are the total radiation energy density , momentum density and pressure tensor , respectively . @xmath40 and @xmath41 are planck mean and energy mean absorption coefficients . an implicit method is required because of the extremely short time step needed by the explicit method ( grid size over the speed of light ) , but the implicit method is time consuming , requiring solution of an n@xmath42n@xmath43 matrix equation at each timestep .    a second , less accurate but less costly , approach is to add a radiative source ( heating / cooling ) term in the energy equation , use the diffusion approximation in the optically thick region , and use an approximation to treat the optically thin region @xcite .",
    "when the radiation pressure is negligible , as in the case for protostellar disks , and the radiation field is nearly in equilibrium ( @xmath44 ) , equations [ eq : ree ] and [ eq : mee ] become @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the radiative flux .",
    "we examine the justification for ignoring the advection term ( within the term on the left side of eq .",
    "[ eq : ree ] ) and the term describing work done by radiation on the gas ( second term of the right side of eq .",
    "[ eq : ree ] ) following the criterion given by @xcite .",
    "if in one system , @xmath48 is the characteristic size , u is the characteristic velocity and @xmath49 is the optical depth of @xmath48 , the terms describing the advection and the work done by the radiation can be ignored if @xmath501 and @xmath511 , which is called static diffusion limit .",
    "this criterion can be simply understood as follows :    the timescale for radiation to propagate across a region of length @xmath48 and mean optical depth @xmath49 is of order @xmath52 for comparison , the material crossing time of this region is @xmath53 so that the ratio of these two timescales is @xmath54 if this ratio is far less than one , the region is in radiative quasi - equilibrium before the material carrying radiation energy away so that the energy emitted and absorbed equals to the diffusion term ( eq . [ eq : ree ] ) . in a 3-d accretion disk ,",
    "this typical velocity is the keplerian velocity .",
    "however in our 2-d axisymmetric simulation , this velocity is just the mean radial velocity of the gas .",
    "thus , @xmath55 is close to the viscous time which is longer than the time for sound to cross a scale height @xmath56 by a factor of order @xmath57 .    in our simulations , even at the maximum temperatures achieved in the innermost disk , @xmath58 (  4 ) and",
    "so the approximation of radiative equilibrium should be valid except at very large optical depths .",
    "it turns out that , during the outburst , vertical rosseland mean optical depths @xmath59 in the innermost disk .",
    "thus our approximation is justified , though it may break down at smaller radii than we have considered here .    in detail , the radiative transfer in the optically thick disk , defined as the region where @xmath60 , is given in the diffusion approximation by @xmath61 where the flux @xmath47 is @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the flux limiter , @xmath64 with @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the rosseland mean of the absorption coefficient .",
    "the optically thin region is more complicated . in this region",
    "we restrict our considerations to radiative transport in the vertical direction only .",
    "we have developed two methods to solve this problem in collaboration with members of the indiana disk group ( d. durisen , k. cai , & a. boley , 2008 , personal communication ) .",
    "the first method considers the cooling rate of every cell in the optically thin region can be written as : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the planck mean opacity at the temperature @xmath69 , @xmath70 is the temperature of the envelope , and also j(z ) and @xmath71 are the mean intensity and the optical depth of the envelop at height z in the disk atmosphere . the first term is the energy emitted by the cell , while the second and third terms are the energy absorbed from the optically thick region and from the envelope .",
    "using the two stream approximation , @xmath72 this treatment assumes flux conservation and thus ignores energy dissipation in the atmosphere .",
    "the net flux @xmath73 from the disk photosphere is then @xmath74 where @xmath34 is the cosine of the angle measured from the vertical .",
    "thus @xmath75 @xmath73 is approximately @xmath76 where @xmath70 is a term which accounts for the external irradiation ( see equation ( 10 ) in @xcite ) . @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the temperature and optical depth of the first optically thick cell right below the photosphere ( again , see @xcite).finally , we must set @xmath79 to obtain a closed expression for @xmath20 : @xmath80 which is the intensity from the optically thin region above height @xmath81 .",
    "theoretically , the first term should also have e@xmath82 .",
    "however , since we only consider the optically thin region here , we ignore it to simplify the calculation and save computational time .",
    "the second method is much simpler but limited to this particular problem with no irradiation .",
    "as we do not consider irradiation , we can use the usual gray atmosphere result . without the third term in equation ( [ 2 ] ) , we have @xmath83 and in a gray case @xmath84 where @xmath85 is given by the boundary flux @xmath86 as equation [ 3 ] . in detail , counting @xmath87 grid cell index i as increasing with increasing @xmath87 and @xmath49 , we set the first grid with @xmath88 as the boundary grid and @xmath78=@xmath89 .",
    "then we derive the effective temperature ( or equivalently , the boundary flux ) using the gray approximation @xmath90 with @xmath85 , we use equation [ eq : diffusiont ] to set the temperatures of all cells at @xmath30 , @xmath91 , and use the diffusion equation ( [ eq : diffusion ] ) at all @xmath92 .",
    "this way of matching the `` optically thin '' ( gray ) atmosphere to the `` optically thick '' ( diffusion equation ) interior removes the temperature jump seen at the boundary between the two treatments seen in the simulations of @xcite .",
    "both methods give similar results if there is no irradiation(see appendix a ) - basically , they are the same except for the assumed directionality of the radiation field .",
    "we use the second method in this paper , although the first method is of interest for cases in which external irradiation is important .",
    "we have adopted the bell & lin ( 1994 ) opacity fits to facilitate comparison with previous calculations @xcite ; subsequent improvements in low - temperature molecular opacities will modify results at low temperatures ( zhu et al 2009 ) , but should not substantially affect the outburst behavior driven at higher temperatures .      to complete the model",
    "we need a prescription for the dimensionless viscosity @xmath10 .",
    "the key physics we want to capture is the dependence of the mri and gi transport on position in the disk ( see , e.g. , miller & stone 2000 for mri activity as a function of height in the disk ) .",
    "for the mri , we set @xmath93 when @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is a critical temperature ( typically @xmath96 ) where thermal ionization makes the disk conductive enough to sustain the mri . , which means @xmath10 is not constant with height ] in addition we calculate @xmath97 ( and in models where the disk is not assumed to be symmetric about the midplane , @xmath98 ) and set @xmath93 if @xmath99 or @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the maximum surface density of the mri active layer on one side of the disk ( in our current model we assume @xmath101=50 g @xmath102 ) .",
    "otherwise the disk is magnetically dead and @xmath103 . also to avoid the strong mri viscous heating at the disk s upper photosphere with very low density",
    ", we set @xmath104 for the region with @xmath105 .",
    "the value of @xmath106 predicted by theory is uncertain , with widely - varying estimates depending upon mean magnetic fluxes , magnetic prandtl numbers , and other assumptions ( guan et al .",
    "2008 , johansen & levin 2008 , fromang et al .",
    "2007 ) . given these uncertainties ,",
    "observational constraints take on special significance . a recent review of the observational evidence by king , pringle , & livio ( 2007 ) argues that @xmath107 must be large , of the order 0.1 - 0.4 , based in part on observations of dwarf novae and x - ray binaries where there is no question of gravitational instability .",
    "our empirical study of fu ori , where we were able to constrain the radial extent of the high accretion state , implies values of @xmath108 .",
    "( zhu et al .  2007 ) .    for the gi",
    ", we calculate the toomre @xmath109 parameter @xmath110 when @xmath111 the disk is gravitationally unstable .",
    "full global models @xcite and physical arguments ( gammie 2001 ) suggest that if the disk is sufficiently thin angular momentum transport by gi is localized and can be crudely described by an equivalent @xmath10 .",
    "we set @xmath112 which is independent of @xmath87 .",
    "this has the sensible effect of turning on gi driven angular momentum transport when @xmath113 and turning off gi driven angular momentum transport when @xmath109 is large . in regions with both gi and mri we set @xmath114 ( in these regions @xmath115 ) .",
    "the maximum @xmath116 is @xmath110.1 during the simulations , consistent with our assumption that fragmentation does not occur .",
    "our prescription for @xmath116 on q is heuristic and other forms are plausible .",
    "gammie ( 2001 ) and lodato & rice ( 2004 , 2005 ) found that the amplitude of gi depends on the cooling rate in addition to q ; and balbus & papaloizou ( 1999 ) argued that the angular momentum flux carried by gi is a global effect and the local viscosity description can only be valid near the corotation radius .",
    "however , using self - consistent cooling , boley et al .",
    "2006 showed that the @xmath117 agrees with the gammie description very well , which assumes that the gi viscous heating is locally balanced by the cooling .",
    "recent smooth particle hydrodynamics sph simulations by cossins et al .",
    "( 2009 ) also showed that gi disks with tightly wound spiral arms can be approximated by a local treatment .",
    "we use spherical polar coordinates and assume axisymmetry in all our simulations . to sample both the inner disk and the outer disk , we use a logarithmic radial grid ( radial grids are uniform in log(r - r@xmath118 ) ) from 0.06 - 40 au and a uniform @xmath87 grid in @xmath119 .",
    "this gives adequate radial resolution for both the inner and outer disk , and spans a large enough range in @xmath87 to include the optically thick region of the disk .",
    "parameters for all the 2d simulations are listed in table 1 .",
    "all our disk models begin with the initial temperature distribution @xmath120 and @xmath121 , @xmath122 from 0.4 - 100 au , so the disk is approximately in dynamical equilibrium .",
    "we set @xmath123 using a @xmath124=10@xmath125 m@xmath126/yr constant @xmath10 ( @xmath127 ) one - zone accretion disk model ( see equation 3 in @xcite ) .",
    "although this is not an exact steady - state model , the disk relaxes rapidly at the beginning of the simulation .",
    "we apply outflow boundary conditions @xcite to all boundaries . in some simulations the disk",
    "is assumed to be symmetric about the midplane to reduce computational cost ; for these half - disk simulations we use a reflecting boundary condition @xcite at the midplane .",
    "the inner boundary is set to either 0.06 au , 0.1 au , or 0.3 au to examine how different inner radii affect disk evolution .",
    "these parameters are listed in table 1 .",
    "we follow the evolution of the disk for 10@xmath128 years .",
    "typically several outbursts occur during the simulation .",
    "after the first outburst , the subsequent outbursts are similar and do not depend on the initial condition .",
    "thus , we use the disk density and temperature distribution after the first two outbursts as the new initial condition to study the third outburst for various 1d and 2d models .",
    "the disk mass for this initial condition is @xmath9 0.5 @xmath129 .      in the protostellar phase ,",
    "the disk is unlikely to transport mass steadily from @xmath9100 au all the way to the star at an accretion rate matching the mass infall rate @xmath130 from the envelope to the outer disk .",
    "the outburst sequence we find here is qualitatively similar to that found by @xcite , gammie ( 1999 ) , and book & hartmann ( 2001 ) .",
    "mass added to the outer disk moves inwards due to gi , but piles up in the inner disk as gi becomes less effective at small r. eventually , the large @xmath131 and energy dissipation leads to enough thermal ionization to trigger the mri .",
    "then the inner disk accretes at a much higher mass accretion rate , which resembles fu orionis - type outbursts . after the inner disk has drained out and becomes too cold to sustain the mri , the disk returns to the low state . during the low state mass",
    "continuously accretes from large radius ( or from an infalling envelope ) causing matter to pile up at the radius where gi becomes ineffective yet again , leading to another outburst .",

    "regions above the top solid curve limit the low-@xmath15 photosphere with @xmath105 to @xmath104 . between the top and next lower solid curve lies the mri - active layer with @xmath134<50 g@xmath135 and @xmath136 .",

    "the contours in figures [ fig:5polar]-[fig:5rho ] show the outer disk ( r>1au ) is geometrically thick , with a ratio of vertical scale height h to radius h / r@xmath90.2 , and massive , while the inner disk is thin with a low surface density .",
    "the inner disk is stable against gi and can not transport mass effectively .",
    "the mass coming from the gi driven outer disk piles up at several au .",
    "the gi thus gradually becomes stronger at several au and the disk heats up .",

    ".    when the ti is triggered , @xmath154 exhibits strong short - timescale variations ( panel ( b , c , d ) of fig . [ fig : diffsetdm ] ) .",
    "this is caused by convection during the transition between the ti high and low states ; the large temperature gradients at the transition make it highly convectively unstable by the schwarzschild criterion ( see  4 for details ) .",

    "as the resolution increases , however , the @xmath156 model becomes more and more variable .",
    "these models , and especially the convection zones , are not converged even at our highest resolution .",
    "this is not a major concern , as the fine structure of convection in our axisymmetric , phenomenological @xmath10 viscosity model will not be the same as the fine structure of convection in a three dimensional , mhd turbulent disk ; further resolving this structure would not improve the model .",
    "one aspect of the details of convection is worth commenting on .",
    "panel ( d ) in figure [ fig : diffsetdm ] shows a full - disk model , which exhibit less variability than the half - disk models .",
    "convection in the full - disk models can penetrate , rather than reflecting back from , the midplane .",
    "this feature of disk convection is consistent with linear theory ( ruden et al .",
    "1988 ) , which shows that the most unstable mode has no nodes in @xmath163 . because the maximum mass accretion rates and the outburst duration times are similar for half - disk and full - disk models ,",
    "most of our simulations have been carried with one - sided models to save computation time .",
    "however , we need to use the full - disk models to study convection during the outburst .",
    "though our 2d simulations exhibit complex time - dependent behavior , the vertical structure of the simulated disk can be well fit by a simple analytical calculation plus some basic assumptions .    assuming local energy dissipation and with a given effective temperature and viscosity parameter @xmath10 , the disk structure can be defined by the following equations . assuming all the viscosity - generated energy radiates vertically , we have @xmath164 where the vertical flux @xmath47 is @xmath165 the viscosity is @xmath166 and @xmath167 with hydrostatic equilibrium , @xmath168 and the equation of state , @xmath169 @xmath15,@xmath69 , and @xmath18 are functions of z. equation [ eq : rt ] can be integrated towards the midplane given @xmath170 as the boundary condition .",

    "so we change the initial conditions and repeat the integration until @xmath174 , in which case we have the self - consistent vertical structure solution .",
    "this procedure is identical to that described in zhu et al .",
    "( 2009 ) ; we will call these local vertical multi - zone ( lvmz ) models .",
    "figure [ fig:2 ] shows the vertical structure at 0.1 au from the 2d simulation and that from the lvmz with the same central temperature .",
    "though the 2d model can not resolve the region where @xmath175 @xmath176 , the 2d model otherwise agrees with the lvmz very well , which means that at 0.1 au the local treatment is a good approximation even during the ti high state , and that radial energy transport is not important .",
    "we find that in general the simulation follows the s curve calculated by the lvmz very well during the whole ti activation process ( see appendix b ) .    in the lower left panel of figure [ fig:2 ] ,",
    "the pressure plateau around @xmath177 is caused by the rapid increase in opacity with increasing temperature near @xmath178 as h ionizes ( see the appendix in zhu et al .",
    "this means that the optical depth can change significantly while the pressure remains nearly the same .",
    "the large vertical temperature gradient causes this region to become convectively unstable .",
    "as shown in the lower right panel , the dense gas is on top of the thin gas at @xmath179 which is clearly unstable against convection or rayleigh - taylor instability .",
    "though this convective region is only at the surface and barely resolved at 0.1 au , it extends to the whole disk at 0.2 au , where convective patterns even penetrate the mid - plane ( fig .",

    "convection occurs wherever the schwarzschild criterion is violated : @xmath180 in our case ( @xmath35 ) . for an optically thick disk ,",
    "if the opacity can be described as @xmath181 @xcite , @xcite derives @xmath182(1+@xmath183)/(4-@xmath63 ) .",
    "thus , the disk is convectively unstable when its temperature is in the range with the opacity satisfying ( 1+@xmath183)/(4-@xmath63)>(@xmath184)/@xmath33=0.4 .    before the outburst",

    "a self - consistent thermodynamic treatment will be considered in a later paper . ]",
    "the dead zone is isothermal without any energy generation , which means it is also convectively stable with @xmath1890 .    during the ti high state ,",

    "based on the opacity given by bell & lin ( 1994 ) , @xmath1941 so that the disk is convectively unstable .",
    "our numerical simulations have also shown that @xmath195 in these regions ( changing from 0.4 at @xmath196 to 1 at @xmath197 ) . however , convection turns out to be inefficient in these regions , with convective speeds far less than the sound speeds ( lower right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : convection ] ) .",
    "\\2 ) at 0.15 au < r < 0.35 au , the midplane is hot enough that hydrogen begins to be ionized .",
    "the midplane is thermally unstable , and @xmath198 even becomes negative .",
    "the disk heats up until the midplane temperature @xmath199 and it becomes thermally stable .",
    "the surface , however , is still far cooler than @xmath200 , with the effective temperature @xmath201 . at some height in the disk",
    "there is a transition where the opacity depends steeply on the temperature and convection is strong . at these radii",
    "the transition is close to the midplane and strong convection stirs the entire disk .",
    "the largest scale eddies penetrate the midplane .",
    "figure [ fig : trace ] shows a velocity map of the convective eddies in region ( 2 ) .",
    "we study them by inserting trace particles .",
    "these particles rise up with the hot red fingers which are in the ti high state .",
    "when they approach the surface , they enter the region which is cool , dense and in the ti low state",
    ". then they fall with the cool green fingers to the midplane where they will be heated up again .",
    "the convective velocity can be estimated by assuming the particles in the red fingers are accelerated by the buoyancy force from the surrounding dense green fingers .",
    "consider the red fingers are in ti high state with t@xmath920,000 k and @xmath202 , while the green fingers are in ti low state with t@xmath92,000 k and @xmath203 .",
    "thus , in the rest frame of the green fingers @xmath204 where @xmath205 is height of the eddy . @xmath206=gm@xmath207/r@xmath208@xmath209h/2 . while the velocity of the red fingers in the rest frame of the green fingers is @xmath210 the real eddy velocity should between v@xmath211 and v@xmath212 . if h / r@xmath90.1 , @xmath205=0.5 h and r=0.2 au , we derive v@xmath2132.3 km s@xmath214 and v@xmath215 7.1 km s@xmath214 .",
    "thus the average eddy velocity should be around 4 km s@xmath214 .",
    "the maximum velocity should not be larger than twice the average velocity .",
    "the lower left panel shows the velocity of these eddies , whose velocity is around 4 km s@xmath214 .",
    "the maximum velocity takes place at the surface .",
    "although convection is subsonic at the midplane , it is supersonic at the surface ( lower right panel in fig .",

    "\\3 ) at @xmath216 most of the region is already in the ti high state with @xmath217 .",
    "thus @xmath218 , which is similar to the numerical simulation .",
    "the surface region where the high state joins to the low state is , however , still convectively unstable ( refer to fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] which shows @xmath186 is very large at the transition ) .",
    "unfortunately our simulation barely resolves this region .",
    "generally , convection in our simulation is strongly correlated with ti ( which is not surprising , since both are related to steep gradients in the opacity ) . in the outer region where the ti is inactive ,",
    "convection is weak and inefficient .",
    "when the ti is active , the convection patterns depend on the vertical height of the point where hydrogen begins to ionize .",
    "if this transition is close to the midplane , convection is strong and penetrates the midplane .",
    "otherwise , only the surface is affected by convection .",
    "using our adopted parameters , our 2d simulations produce outbursts which are similar to fu orionis outbursts , with comparable maximum mass accretion rates ( @xmath219 ) and decay timescales ( @xmath220yrs ) .",
    "the outbursts begin with the gi transferring mass to the inner disk until it is hot enough to activate the mri ; at that point the disk accretes at a much higher mass accretion rate because of the much higher efficiency of the mri in transferring angular momentum .",
    "our outburst scenario is similar to that of @xcite .",
    "however , their outbursts were at a much lower mass accretion rate , @xmath6 , and lasted a longer time , @xmath7 yr . as discovered by book & hartmann ( 2001 ) and explained in zhu et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , their weaker and slower outbursts are due to their lower mri trigger temperatures ( @xmath221 ) and smaller @xmath222 .",
    "specifically , with a lower @xmath223 , the mri is triggered at a larger radius with a lower surface density , resulting in less mass accumulation in the inner disk .",
    "combined with a smaller @xmath10 , this results in a lower mass loss rate and a longer viscous timescale .",
    "our choice of @xmath224 is close to the temperature range at which dust is expected to sublimate .",
    "this suggests that the mechanism for turn - on of the mri thermally may be controlled by the elimination of the small dust grains that effectively absorb electrons and thus quench the mri .",
    "our radiative transfer modeling of fu ori ( zhu et al .",
    "2007 ) suggested that to fit the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _",
    "irs spectrum , the rapidly - accreting , hot inner disk must extend out to @xmath225  au , inconsistent with a pure thermal instability model @xcite . in our 2d results",
    "we find mri triggering at about 2 au , much more consistent with the _ spitzer _ data and our previous analysis in zhu et al .",
    "as fu ori has a smaller estimated central star mass ( 0.3 m@xmath126 ) than the 1 m@xmath126 used in our simulations , its hot inner disk should be slightly smaller than derived here , but still in agreement with observations .",
    "non - keplerian rotation has not been observed from optical to near - ir ( 5@xmath34 m ) lines @xcite since these lines come from inner disk within 1 au where the disk is not massive .",
    "however , due to the fact that the disk is massive and gravitationally unstable at large radii ( > 2 au ) , the disk has slightly sub - keplerian rotation there and this effect may be observable in the far - ir or submm @xcite",
    ".    we can not calculate meaningful optical ( b magnitude ) light curves for comparison with the historical observations of fu ori objects because our inner disk radius is too large ; this results in our maximum effective temperatures being too low in comparison with observations .",
    "( this constraint was due to the very long computation times required during outburst ; moving the inner radius inward greatly lengthens the computing time . )",
    "we therefore computed a 1@xmath34 m light curve as a prediction to compare with future observations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lc2 ] ) , assuming that the disk radiates like a blackbody at each radius s effective temperature ; the lower panel shows the disk s surface and central temperature at 0.06 au .",
    "the outburst has rise time @xmath9 10 years , which is similar to v 1515 cyg but longer than fu ori .",
    "the thermal instability is triggered on a much shorter timescale : as the lower panel shows , the disk s central temperature rises sharply within 1 year .",
    "however , since the mass at the inner disk is still low , the mass accretion rate and the effective temperature can not increase significantly until the mri transfers more mass from the outer disk to the inner disk on a viscous timescale .",
    "overall , our simulation agrees with v 1515 cyg reasonably well but has a longer rise time than fu ori and v 1057 cyg .",
    "this might be improved by using a smaller inner radius , a consistent central mass , and a self - consistent boundary condition @xcite .",
    "our simulation suggests that the short - timescale variations appearing in the light curves of fu ori @xcite might be caused by convection in the high state to low state transition region .",
    "the observations show @xmath226 and timescales of less than one day .",
    "the amplitude of the variability in the 2d models is @xmath227 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : lc2 ] ) . in 3d",
    "the amplitude of the variability will be reduced because there will be several convective eddies at each radius and averaging over these will reduce the variability . if we assume that the azimuthal extent of a convective eddy is @xmath228 , then there will be @xmath229 convective eddies and the variability will be reduced by a factor of @xmath230 if @xmath231 , suggesting a variability of @xmath232 .",
    "this agreement the data is encouraging , but it is likely that the details of convection in a magnetized , three dimensional disk will be different from that found in our viscous , axisymmetric models .",
    "the modest success of our model , however , might motivate the development of energetically self - consistent 3d magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) models of the inner disk of fu ori .    the timescale of variability in our 2d models ( months ) is much longer than the observed 1 day .",
    "the timescale of variability might be shortened by ( 1 ) increased resolution , since the timescale of variability in our models increases with resolution ; ( 2 ) switching off all components of stress in equation [ eq : stress ] except the r-@xmath21 component , since the other components act to retard and smooth convection ( 3 ) replacing the viscosity model used here by mhd turbulence , since the viscosity tends to suppress small scale structure ; ( 4 ) 3d effects , since one might expect to see variability on timescales of @xmath233 day , using @xmath234 and our estimate for @xmath235 from above .",
    "overall , although convective behavior revealed by our current simulations are very preliminary ( they depend on the simulation resolution , opacity , details of the turbulence etc . )",
    ", it seems reasonable that convection accounts for the short - timescale variability of fu orionis objects .",
    "hartmann , hinkle , & calvet ( 2004 ) found that some mildly supersonic turbulence ( @xmath9 2 c@xmath236 ) was needed to explain the width of @xmath237co first - overtone lines of fu ori .",
    "high resolution spectral modeling suggests that co lines broadened with @xmath94 km / s turbulent velocity fit the observations well ( zhu et al .",
    "hartmann , hinkle , & calvet ( 2004 ) proposed that the mri could be a mechanism to drive the supersonic turbulence , while here we suggest that convection could also drive the turbulence .",
    "convection is subsonic at the midplane in the ti high state , but as the convective eddies travel to the surface the temperature drops and convection becomes supersonic ( see the lower right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : convection ] ) . numerical simulations ( lower left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : convection ] ) and the simple analytical estimate ( eq . [ eq : vturb ] ) suggest the 5 km s@xmath214 is a typical convective velocity .",
    "we also studied the disk central temperature at the stage when the mri is activated and then moves inwards .",
    "the transition between the ti active and inactive region is sharp and occurs over a radial interval comparable to the disk scale height .",
    "the fronts travel at 2.7 @xmath238 , which is almost the sound speed at t = 1000 k. this thermal front velocity is much higher than @xmath239 predicted by lin et al . ( 1985 ) and we will discuss this phenomenon in detail in our next parameter study paper . notice that in our model the stress is assumed to respond instantaneously to a change in the temperature caused by the radial energy diffusion ; this may indeed be the case if magnetic field mixes into the newly heated gas from the hot side of the transition front .",
    "if the magnetic field takes longer than @xmath240 to build up then the front will travel more slowly .",
    "radiation pressure starts to become significant during the ti high state , with p@xmath212/p@xmath241 0.3 in the innermost regions .",
    "we have conducted some experiments including radiation pressure using the diffusion approximation and find generally similar behavior to what has been shown in this paper , though the disk is slightly thicker with the inclusion of radiation pressure .",
    "again , we note that our inner radius is considerably larger than those of t tauri stars , so radiation pressure might be more important as accreting material joins the central star .",
    "we have studied the time evolution of fu orionis outbursts in a layered disk scenario , using an axisymmetric two dimensional viscous hydrodynamics code with radiative transfer .",
    "both the mri and gi are considered as angular momentum transport mechanisms and are modeled by a phenomenological @xmath10 prescription . besides the surface of the disk ionized by cosmic rays and x - rays ,",
    "the mri is also considered to be active as long as the disk s temperature is above a critical temperature @xmath223 , so that thermal ionization can provide enough ions to couple the plasma to the magnetic field .    starting with a massive disk equivalent to a constant @xmath10 disk with @xmath124=10@xmath242 m@xmath126/yr and @xmath10=0.1 , several outbursts appear during our simulation .",
    "these outbursts begin with the gi transferring mass to the inner disk until the inner disk gradually becomes gravitationally unstable .",
    "eventually the disk at 2 au is hot enough to trigger the mri and then the mri active region expands throughout the whole inner disk . with the increasing temperature",
    "since the mri is transferring more mass to the inner disk , the ti is triggered and a `` high state '' expands outwards to 0.3 au .",
    "the outburst state lasts for hundreds of years and drains the inner disk ; the disk then returns to the low state .",
    "convection appears at the inner disk during the ti high state . in the outer region ( @xmath243 ) , where the ti is inactive ,",
    "convection is weak and inefficient . at 0.15<r<0.35 @xmath244 during outburst",
    ", there is a hydrogen ionization zone at @xmath245 , and strong convection is present .",
    "the convection even penetrates the midplane to form antisymmetric convective rolls . in the innermost region",
    "most of the disk is hot , the hydrogen ionization zone is close to the photosphere , and weak convection is confined to the disk surface .",
    "our model shows maximum accretion rates and outburst duration timescales similar to those of the known fu orionis objects . unlike the pure ti theory",
    ", our model produces an au scale inner disk with high mass accretion rate , in agreement with the observational constraints .    with some simple assumptions our simulations have produced fu orionis - like outbursts .",
    "they also pose some interesting questions for future study . in a later paper",
    "we will compare our 2-d results to 1-d simulations ; the latter will allow us to consider longer disk evolutionary timescales",
    ".    a dynamical gi simulation at au scale , with both self - gravity and radiation , will be important to understand angular momentum transport by gi and the thermal structure of the inner disk .",
    "however , considering the large keplerian velocity of the inner disk , a self - consistent radiation hydrodynamic scheme will be needed .",
    "our simulations have also shown that convection is important in fu orionis objects due to the large vertical temperature gradient at the hydrogen ionization zone .",
    "a fully 3-d simulation with both mhd and radiation , together with a self - consistent treatment of the equation of state , will be essential to understanding the role of convection .",
    "also the very inner disk where the mri is thermally activated by the irradiation and the boundary layer may also play a role in the disk evolution .",
    "z. zhu wants to thank dr .",
    "r. durisen and k. cai for the inspiring discussion about their radiative transport scheme .",
    "this work was supported in part by nasa grant nnx08a139 g , by the university of michigan , and by a sony faculty fellowship , a richard and margaret romano professorial scholarship , and a university scholar appointment to cg .",
    "jcm was supported by nasa s chandra fellowship pf7 - 80048 .",
    "to test the radiative transfer scheme ( and particularly the boundary condition at the disk photosphere ) , we have constructed a disk model in which the viscous heating is turned off when @xmath179 .",
    "this makes the vertical flux constant for @xmath246 and allows us to test our scheme against a gray atmosphere model .",
    "the disk structure shown here is that calculated with method 1 as discussed in  2.2 .",
    "the structure calculated with method 2 is even in a better agreement than method 1 , since it directly uses the gray atmosphere structure as the boundary condition .",
    "the left panel in figure [ fig:1 ] shows the flux through the atmosphere at different heights for one radius , while the dotted line is @xmath247 with t@xmath248 derived from the simulation .",
    "the right panel shows the disk temperature structure at this radius from the 2d simulation ( solid line ) and the theoretical gray atmosphere temperature structure ( t@xmath147=3/4 t@xmath249(@xmath49 + 2/3 ) ( dotted line ) .",
    "the vertical structure in the 2d simulation agrees well with the gray atmosphere structure , and improves on the original scheme of @xcite by eliminating a temperature jump at the photosphere .",
    "the thermal instability ( ti ) model was developed to account for outbursts in dwarf novae systems ( faulkner , lin , & papaloizou 1983 ) .",
    "but it also has features that make it attractive for explaining fu ori outbursts @xcite .",
    "although in this paper we find that mri triggering is mainly responsible for initiating fu orionis outbursts , the ti still exists and can be triggered during the outburst . with the increasing mass accretion rate by the mri operating ,",
    "the innermost disk is heated up to hydrogen ionization and the disk becomes thermally unstable .",
    "finally , ti sets in and the innermost disk enter a high ( fully ionized ) state .",
    "the basic idea behind the ti can be illustrated by the disk @xmath250 relationship ( s curve , fig.[fig : scurve ] ) .",
    "the disk is in thermal equilibrium on this curve . to the left of the curve cooling exceeds heating and to",
    "the right heating exceeds cooling .",
    "as the disk central temperature reaches @xmath251 the disk transitions from the low - state lower branch to the high - state ( @xmath252 ) upper branch ; it can not sit on the unstable middle branch .",
    "as discussed in  4.1 , the lvmz method @xcite produces similar vertical structure to our 2d models . here",
    ", we use the lvmz to calculate the disk s @xmath250 relation at 0.1 au in figure [ fig : scurve ] .",
    "the solid line is the equilibrium curve , while the crosses show @xmath131 and @xmath253 at 0.1 au during 2d simulations ; the disk moves from the lower left to the upper right with time .",
    "the crosses trace the lvmz curve remarkably well .",
    "since the lvmz assumes the local cooling through surface balances local viscous heating , it follows that 2d effects , such as radial transport of heat , are not important in this region .",
    "in one zone model , where the midplane opacity is used at all @xmath254 and the total surface density replaces @xmath255 , the s curve can be obtained via @xmath256 thus , @xmath257 where @xmath131 is the surface density and @xmath258 is the sound speed at the local central disk . for an optically - thick disk , we have t@xmath259=@xmath260@xmath261t@xmath249 , where @xmath261=@xmath262@xmath131 and @xmath262 is the rosseland mean opacity @xcite .",
    "then , @xmath263 where @xmath264@xmath146 is the gas constant , and @xmath34 is the mean molecular weight .",
    "this @xmath253 and @xmath131 relationship is shown in figure [ fig : scurve ] , which differs significantly from the lvmz s curve .",
    "these s curves again make the point that the observed large outer radius , 0.5 @xmath265 1 au , of the high accretion rate portion of the fu ori disk poses difficulties for the pure thermal instability model . even in the situation explored by @xcite , in which the thermal instability is triggered by a massive planet in the inner disk ,",
    "the outer radius of the high state is still the same as in @xcite , @xmath9 20 @xmath266 . the relatively high temperatures ( @xmath267  k ) required to trigger the thermal instability ( due to the ionization of hydrogen ) are difficult to achieve at large radii ; they require large surface densities which in turn produce large optical depths , trapping the radiation internally and making the central temperature much higher than the surface ( effective ) temperature .",
