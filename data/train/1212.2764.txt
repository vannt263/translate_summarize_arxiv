    "later on , the research of such a kind of average has attributed a lot of attentions ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the authors in @xcite have recently proposed to analyze such multiple ergodic averages from the point of view of multifractal analysis .",

    "we extend it on @xmath51 for all @xmath52 by induction :    @xmath53    for simplicity , we will simply write @xmath54 for @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",

    "this observation was first exploited in @xcite in order to compute the box dimension of some subset of @xmath83 . consider the following partition of @xmath84 : @xmath85 observe that if @xmath86 with @xmath87 , then @xmath88 depends only on @xmath89 , the restriction of @xmath81 on @xmath90 .",
    "so the summands in the definition of @xmath82 can be put into different groups , each of which depends on one restriction @xmath89 .",
    "for this reason , we decompose @xmath91 as follows : @xmath92    let @xmath93 be a probability measure on @xmath91 .",

    "we consider @xmath93 as a measure on @xmath94 for every @xmath95 with @xmath87",

    "then @xmath102 is a probability measure on @xmath91 and we call it a _ telescopic product measure_. kenyon , peres and solomyak @xcite used this kind of measures to compute the hausdorff dimension of sets like @xmath103 which was proposed in @xcite .    a class of measures @xmath96 will play the same role as gibbs measures played in the study of simple ergodic averages ( @xmath35 ) . concerning the dimension of @xmath96 ( see @xcite for the dimension of a measure ) , we have the following result which is one of the main ingredients of the proof of the main result ( theorem [ thm principal ] ) and which has its own interest .",

    "another ingredient of the proof of theorem [ thm principal ] is a law of large numbers relative to the probability @xmath96 .",

    "@xmath125 @xmath126    we observe that the set @xmath34 is not invariant .",
    "so it is not a standard set studied from the classical dynamical system point of view .",
    "actually , as we shall see , in general the dimension of the set @xmath34 can not be described by invariant measures supported on it .",
    "this is confirmed by the following result .    given two real valued functions @xmath127 and @xmath128 defined on @xmath91 .",
    "for @xmath129 , let @xmath34 be the set of all points @xmath81 such that @xmath130 we describe the size of the invariant part of @xmath34 by @xmath131    [ invariant ] let @xmath127 and @xmath128 be two hlder continuous functions on @xmath91 . if @xmath34 supports an ergodic measure , then @xmath132    it is interesting to compare this result with the level sets of @xmath133-statistics studied in @xcite .",
    "we return to the above theorem .",
    "a remarkable corollary is that when @xmath134 , we must have @xmath135 if @xmath34 supports an ergodic measure , or even an invariant measure ( using jacobs entropy decomposition ) .",
    "therefore , it is possible that for some @xmath136 , @xmath34 has strictly positive hausdorff dimension but it does nt carry any invariant measure .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we first construct a class of measures , called telescopic product measures , part of which will play the same role as gibbs measures played in the classical theory .",
    "this construction is inspired by kenyon - peres - solomyak @xcite ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "then we establish a law of large numbers relative to such a telescopic product measure .",
    "telescopic product measures constitute a new object of study . in section 3 ,",
    "we prove that any telescopic product measure is exact and we obtain a formula for its dimension . in section 4",
    ", we study a non  linear transfer operator and we prove the existence and the uniqueness of its positive solution .",
    "we also prove the analyticity and the convexity of the solution as a function of its parameter @xmath8 .",
    "each solution defines a markov measure associated to which is a telescopic product measure .",
    "the last measure plays the role of a gibbs measure in our study of @xmath34 .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the properties of the pressure function : a ruelle type formula says that the limit in the law of large numbers is the derivative of the pressure ; the pressure function is an analytic and strictly convex function ( except the trivial case ) ; the extreme values of the derivative of the pressure are studied . in section 6 ,",
    "we establish the gibbs property of the telescopic product measures defined by the solution of the non  linear transfer operator .",
    "after all these preparations , many of which have their own interests , we prove the main theorem ( theorem  [ thm principal ] ) in section 7 . in section 8 ,",
    "we discuss the invariant part of @xmath34 .",
    "some concrete examples are presented in section 9 . in the final section",
    ", we make some remarks and present some unsolved problems .",
    "the authors would like to thank b. host for his interests in the work and especially for his remarks , some of which are contained in section 8 .",
    "in this section , we will study telescopic product measures and establish a law of large numbers ( lln ) .",
    "these measures , which take into account the multiplicative structure of the multiple ergodic averages @xmath82 , will play the same role as gibbs measures played in the study of simple ergodic averages . in the next section",

    "but we should point out that @xmath93 is not assumed to be invariant and that @xmath107 is not invariant either .",
