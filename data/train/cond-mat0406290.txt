    "during recent years , the large magnetoresistance of magnetic tunnel junctions ( mtjs ) has attracted much attention due to the possibility of its application in digital storage and magnetic sensor technologies @xcite . in most of the experiments , the mtjs consist of two ferromagnetic metal ( fm ) electrodes separated by a thin insulator ( fm / i / fm ) . in these structures ,",
    "the electrical resistance is reduced when the magnetization direction of the fm layers changes from antiparallel to parallel alignment by an external magnetic field .",
    "because the tunnel magnetoresistance ( tmr ) strongly depends on the spin polarization of the magnetic electrodes @xcite , attempts have been made to fabricate junctions with more highly spin - polarized ferromagnets @xcite .",
    "recent experiments on the tmr have shown that the insertion of a thin nonmagnetic metal ( nm ) layer between insulating barrier and the fm electrode ( fm / i / nm / fm ) reduces the tmr , when thickness of the nm layer increases @xcite .",
    "this decrease of the tmr can be attributed to the decoherence tunneling of electrons from one electrode to the other through the nm layer @xcite . on the other hand , recent observations by yuasa _",
    "et al _ @xcite show clear oscillations of the tmr in high - quality nife / al@xmath0o@xmath1/cu / co junctions in which the cu / co is a single crystal .",
    "this oscillatory behavior has been interpreted in terms of the formation of spin - polarized resonant tunneling .",
    "the effect of nonmagnetic metallic interlayers has been theoretically investigated in fm / nm / i / nm / fm structures . based on the kubo formalism , vedyayev @xmath2 @xmath3 @xcite studied magnetoconductivity as a function of nm layer thickness at low bias voltages . by using the transfer matrix approach ,",
    "wilczynski and barnas @xcite calculated the thickness and voltage dependence of tmr .",
    "these calculations showed that the presence of thin nm spacers can lead to the formation of quantum well states that lead to oscillations of magnetoconductivity and tmr .",
    "when the thickness of only one of the nm layer varies , and also in the case of an asymmetric structure , such as fm / nm / i / fm @xcite , the sign of magnetoconductivity and tmr is predicted to oscillate as a function of the nm layer thickness .",
    "tmr has also been investigated both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite in spin filter tunnel junctions in which a ferromagnetic semiconductor ( fms ) is applied as a magnetic barrier . the large spin polarization achievable using magnetic barriers @xcite makes spin filtering a nearly ideal method for spin injection into semiconductors , enabling novel spintronic devices @xcite . when an fms layer which acts as a spin filter is used in tunnel structures , due to the spin splitting of its conduction band ,",
    "tunneling electrons see a spin - dependent barrier height .",
    "thus one spin channel will have a larger tunneling probability than the other , and a highly spin - polarized current may result .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to investigate theoretically the effect of a magnetic barrier on spin transport in the presence of a nonmagnetic spacer layer . using the transfer matrix method and the nearly - free - electron approximation we will study the variation of tmr and spin polarization of tunneling electrons in terms of the spacer thickness and bias voltage at @xmath4=0",
    "k. we assume that the electron wave vector parallel to the interfaces and the electron spin are conserved in the tunneling process through the whole system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the model and the analytic formulae of the spin polarization and tmr for fm / fms / nm / fm structure are presented . in section 3 ,",
    "numerical results obtained for a typical tunnel junction are discussed .",
    "the results of this work are summarized in section 4 .",
    "we consider two semi - infinite fm electrodes separated by a ferromagnetic barrier which acts as a spin filter , and a nonmagnetic metallic layer as a quantum well , in the presence of dc applied bias @xmath5 as shown in fig .",
    "1 . for simplicity , we assume that the two fm electrodes are made of the same metal and all of the interfaces are flat . in a nearly - free - electron approximation of spin - polarized conduction electrons , the longitudinal part of the effective one - electron hamiltonian can be written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 ( @xmath8=1 - 4 ) is the electron effective mass in the @xmath8th layer , and @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the fermi energy in the left electrode .",

    "@xmath18 which corresponds to @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the @xmath14 exchange constant in the magnetic barrier .",
    "the schrdinger equation for a biased barrier layer can be simplified by a coordinate transformation whose solution is the linear combination of the airy function ai[@xmath21 and its complement bi[@xmath21 @xcite . considering all four regions of the fm / fms / nm / fm junction shown in fig .",

    "it is clear that the tunnel current is modulated by the magnetic configurations of the both fm electrodes .",
    "the degree of spin polarization for the tunnel current is defined by @xmath53 where @xmath54 @xmath55 is the spin - up ( spin - down ) current density . for the present structure",

    "numerical calculations have been carried out to investigate the effect of a magnetic barrier and an nm metallic layer on the spin transport in the fe / eus / au / fe structure as a typical mtj .",
    "we have chosen fe and eus because they have cubic structures and the lattice mismatch is very small @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath60 and @xmath61 for fe electrodes are taken corresponding to @xmath62=1.09 @xmath63 and @xmath64=0.42 @xmath63 ( for itinerant @xmath65 electrons ) @xcite .",
    "for the eus layer we use @xmath66=7/2 , @xmath20=0.1 ev @xcite , @xmath67=1.94 ev @xcite as a symmetric barrier height , and @xmath68=1.3788 nm which corresponds to four monolayers of eus@xmath69 @xcite .",
    "the fermi energy in the au layer is @xmath70 ev @xcite . in practice",
    ", the effective masses of electrons may differ from that of free electron , but here for simplicity , we assume all electrons have the same mass , @xmath71 as free electrons .    in our considered system , the magnetization direction of the left fe electrode and",
    "the eus magnetic barrier stays fixed , because they are coupled through the interface . inserting the nm spacer layer between the fms layer and the right fm electrode decreases the exchange coupling between the two fm electrodes .",
    "therefore the right fe electrode is free and may be switched back and forth by an external magnetic field ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . in the following ,",
    "we show the numerical results at @xmath4=0 k , so in the magnetic barrier we have @xmath72 .",
    "the tc for tunneling electrons at the fermi energy , and the tmr in the tunnel junction as a function of the nm layer thickness are shown in figs .",
    "2(a ) and 2 , respectively .",
    "it can be seen that both the tc and the tmr oscillate with the nm layer thickness due to the dependence of these quantities on the incident electron s energy and the nm layer thickness .",
    "the physics behind this behavior is easy to understand . when the energy of the incident electrons is approximately equal to the energy of a quasibound state in the quantum well , a resonance condition is fulfilled and the tc of the electrons through the structure strongly increases . on the other hand ,",
    "the position of the quantum well levels , formed in the nm layer , strongly depends on the well thickness .",
    "therefore , with continuous variation of the @xmath73 , the position of the resonant states varies and this leads to the oscillations of the tc and the tmr . from fig .",
    "2 , it is clear that where the transmission is high , the tmr is low . from the continuous variation of @xmath73 , one can see that both the tc and the tmr oscillate with a period of 0.26 nm which is in excellent agreement with @xmath74/2 , where @xmath74 is the fermi wavelength in the au layer and is equal to 0.522 nm .",
    "the results show that , for the spin - up electrons , the tc is very higher than the spin - down ones both in the parallel and antiparallel alignment of magnetizations .",
    "the reason can be explained by the spin filtering effect of the fms barrier . as shown in fig . 1 , due to the spin splitting of the conduction band in the fms layer , the barrier height for spin - up electrons is lowered and the tunneling probability greatly increases , while for the spin - down electrons the barrier height is raised and hence , the tunneling probability for these electrons reduces .",
    "thus , a large spin - polarized current is produced .    in fig .",
    "2(b ) we have also shown the tmr in terms of thickness , when @xmath73 changes in monolayer steps . at the monolayer thickness @xmath75=0.2355 nm , which corresponds to interlayer distance of au@xmath76 ,",
    "the tmr first increases in the first three monolayer and after that the tmr becomes less and starts to oscillate with a period of approximately 2.5 nm .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath75=0.27 nm , the tmr initially decreases and the period of oscillations is approximately 7 nm .",
    "the voltage dependence of the tmr for several thicknesses is shown in fig .",
    "3 , when @xmath75=0.2355 nm .",
    "we can see that , due to the fms layer , the tmr is asymmetric , as a tunnel junction without a nonmagnetic layer is used . for each fixed voltage , the tmr oscillates , as is shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) for @xmath5=50 mv .",
    "the results show that more than 250% tmr can be obtained in reverse bias . by increasing the number of nonmagnetic monolayers",
    ", the tmr shows an oscillatory behavior in the positive voltages . under a forward bias , electrons at the fermi energy of the left electrode , tunnel into the empty states of the quantum well , which have been created due to the applied bias . therefore the applied bias has a strong influence on the tmr and",
    "the oscillatory behavior will appear .",
    "on the other hand , under a reverse bias , electrons at the fermi energy of the quantum well tunnel into the empty states of the left electrode . in this case",
    ", variations of the applied bias can not strongly affect the tmr .    in order to further see the effect of the fms layer on the tunnel currents",
    ", we have shown in fig .",
    "4 the spin polarization of tunneling electrons as a function of the bias voltage , for @xmath77=0.2355 nm . it is obvious that the spin polarization is symmetric for @xmath75=0 , and becomes strongly asymmetric when the number of monolayers increases .",
    "the results show that the spin polarization can reach 99% , which is evidence of spin filtering effect in the fms layer .",
    "the experimental measurements show that , if one uses a nonmagnetic insulator instead of a magnetic tunnel barrier , very low values for electron - spin polarization and tmr will result @xcite .",
    "the oscillatory behavior of tmr in terms of the nm layer thickness , is qualitatively in agreement with the experiments of yuasa _ et al _ @xcite , and shows that the coherent tunneling of electrons through the quantum well states is the main reason of this behavior .",
    "the present results can be qualitatively compared with those already known in the relevant literature , when a nonmagnetic barrier is used . in @xcite",
    ", the authors showed that in the fm / nm / i / nm / fm systems , the tmr in two different cases has an oscillatory behavior with nm layers : the case where the thickness of both nm layers are equally varied ( symmetric case ) , and the case where only one of the nm layers is increased ( asymmetric case ) . in the symmetric case ,",
    "the tmr is always positive , but in the asymmetric case the tmr oscillates from positive to negative as a function of the nm layer thickness .",
    "the situation of the asymmetric case is similar to our structure in which only one nm layer has been used @xcite .",
    "thus , as it is clear from figs .",
    "2(b ) and 3 , our results are in qualitative agreement with the asymmetric case in fm / nm / i / nm / fm structures .",
    "finally , we discuss the effect of interface scattering on spin - injection from the fm into nm spacer @xcite . for this purpose",
    ", we treated the magnetic barrier as a @xmath78-function @xmath79 , with @xmath80 describing the barrier strength parameter for spin @xmath45 electron . in this case , the parameter @xmath80 is proportional to both height and width of the barrier .",
    "the numerical results showed that with increasing the @xmath80 , the tc reduces , and hence the spin - dependent currents decay exponentially , which is due to the interface resistance . on the other hand , the spin polarization and tmr increase with @xmath80 , and trend gradually towards constant values , because in these values of the barrier parameter , only the fm electrodes have a dominant influence on the spin polarization and tmr .",
    "the magnetotransport behavior in an fm / fms / nm / fm tunnel junctions was investigated theoretically , using the transfer matrix method and the nearly - free - electron approximation .",
    "the numerical results indicate that in fe / eus / au / fe structure , the tmr has an oscillatory behavior as a function of the nm layer thickness . by increasing the thickness of the nm layer , both the tmr and electron - spin polarization ,",
    "oscillate under the forward biases .",
    "due to the presence of a magnetic barrier , there exist more than 250% tmr and 98% spin polarization in the tunnel currents ; this can be obtained by adjusting the thickness and the applied bias .",
    "our study restricted to the zero temperature limit , because the ferromagnetic transition temperature in most of the fms layers is much lower than room temperature @xcite .",
    "low temperature spin transport is , however , important as a testing ground for novel ideas and concepts in future spin electronic devices based on coherent transport @xcite .",
    "one of us ( a.a.s . ) would like to express his sincere thanks to prof .",
    "k. esfarjani for illuminative comments ."
