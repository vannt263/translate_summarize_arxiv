    "the differential energy spectrum of cosmic rays presents two small but significant deviations , called knee and ankle , at the nominal energies of @xmath0 @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "after the first observation of the knee in 1958 ( kulikov et al . , 1958 )",
    "many experiments confirmed , over the decades , the structure of the knee characterized by a specific bend energy , at about @xmath3 @xmath1 , and a spectral index of 3 , above @xmath4 @xmath1 .",
    "only in recent years , experimentally , has an important step forward been taken by the kascade collaboration ( kampert et al . , 2003 ; haungs et al.,2004 ; antoni et al . , 2005 ) which identified and measured the knees of individual ions in a very large energy band ( @xmath5-@xmath6 @xmath1 ) , with relatively small error bars , and accurately charting the characteristic forms of the energy spectra . a vast literature ( see , for example , erlykin , 1996 ) testifies of the many attempts to explain and clarify these two deviations , over almost fifty years",
    "one notable aspect of the solution of the knee problem described here is that the explanation of the ankles of individual ions comes as a gratuity , once the knees are accounted for .",
    "prerequisites to comprehend the present study may be found in a series of previous works regarding the method of calculation ( codino , brunetti and menichelli , 1995 ; brunetti and codino , 2000 , paper i ) and the notion of galactic basin ( codino and plouin , 2003 ; codino and plouin , 2006 , paper ii ) largely employed in the present study .",
    "section 7 describes an important , new inference , based on observational facts , which relates the knee energy to the ankle energy of the individual ions .",
    "this inference is a cross - check , independent from the method of calculation and the notion of galactic basin , that the mechanism generating the ankle and the knee described here is correct .    due to the limited size of the present paper",
    "some collateral aspects of the explanation of the knees are omitted ; among these : ( 1 ) how the agreement with the experimental data is affected by the particular values of the spectral indices and elemental composition of cosmic ions .",
    "( 2 ) implications and justification of the hypothesis of adopting constant spectral indices over the entire energy interval of the cosmic radiation , i.e. @xmath7-@xmath8 @xmath1 .",
    "( 3 ) direct , important consequences of this solution of the knee problem in our discipline . for instance , according to this study , any acceleration mechanisms in the galaxy are extraneous to the origin of the knees and ankles .",
    "another notable consequence is that the extragalactic component of cosmic rays is likely to be marginal even at @xmath9 @xmath1 .",
    "( 4 ) bibliography of previous attempts to explain the knee reported elsewhere ( codino and plouin , 2006 paper iii ) .",
    "in order to evaluate the cosmic ray intensity in a given small volume of the galaxy , for example the solar cavity , the number of cosmic ray trajectories intercepting it has to be computed .",
    "trajectories are just the physical paths of cosmic rays determined by computer simulation .",
    "the initial point of any trajectory is the source while the final point is the site where the cosmic ion disappears from the disk .",
    "nuclear collisions , ionization energy losses and escape from the disc are the three causes that make cosmic rays disappear from the disc .",
    "[ b ! ]    .shapes and field strengths of the regular magnetic fields in spiral galaxies determined by radio continuum measurements .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     detailed calculations indicate that the transition from the results shown in figure 6 to those reported in figure 4 and 5 ( energy spectra to be compared with the experimental data ) is accounted for by the effect of rising cross sections and the position of the local zone in the galaxy .",
    "the similarity of the curves demonstrates that the break of the high plateau caused by the magnetic field is a general phenomenon occurring both in the local zone ( a sphere of 50 @xmath10 in diameter in this particular calculation ) and in the whole disc .",
    "the method of calculation used for the results given in figure 6 is described elsewhere ( see section 4 , paper ii ) .    = 6.7 cm    = 6.7 cm",
    "the comparison of the computed energy spectra with the measured ones , in the energy band @xmath5-@xmath11 @xmath1 , although simple and feasible , requires the spectral indices and chemical composition of the individual cosmic ions at the cosmic - ray sources .",
    "figure 7 shows the differential energy spectrum of the cosmic radiation in the interval @xmath7-@xmath8 @xmath1 with some characteristics . in spite of the two significant deviations at @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xmath1 ,",
    "the spectrum is remarkably linear in the logarithmic scales of intensity and energy .",
    "the subsequent analysis of the knees takes advantage of this linearity by assuming constant spectral indices for any ion in the whole energy range @xmath7-@xmath8 @xmath1 .",
    "this ultrasimplified hypothesis is indeed supported by many experimental data ( on the absence of a spectral break at low energy see , for example , cherry , 1999 ) .",
    "notice however , that any other hypothesis , in the form of two or more values of the spectral indices in the energy range @xmath7-@xmath8 @xmath1 would yield an even better agreement in the comparison with the experimental data .",
    "traditionally , leaky box models of cosmic rays subdivide the spectral index ( always close to 2.7 ) of a nuclear species observed at earth as the sum of two parts : one due to the sources ( typically 2.2 ) and the rest due to the propagation .",
    "the logical necessity for this splitting remains , to date , largely undemonstrated and the observational evidence contradictory , as it results from the comparison of the spectral index at the sources extracted from the analysis of the anisotropy of the arrival direction of high energy cosmic rays ( hillas , 1984 ) and that extracted from the @xmath14-ray spectrum recently measured by the hess collaboration ( aharonian , 2006 ) .",
    "accordingly , the hypothesis for this splitting is not retained .",
    "an empirical approach is adopted here , where spectral indices of the individual ions in the whole disk are assumed to be those measured at earth .",
    "@xmath15 @xmath16 this crude approximation is more than adequate for the explanation of the knees .    in table 2",
    "are given three elemental compositions and related spectral indices ( hereafter called ion blends ) at the arbitrary energy of @xmath17 @xmath1 where the equalization of the computed energy spectra to the experimental ones is imposed .",
    "let us anticipate here that by altering the values of the ion blends , within plausible limits bound to measurements , the agreement between computed and measured energy spectra substantially persists .",
    "notice , on the contrary , that the spectral indices become critical , for the accord with the data , at energy regions quite remote from the knee energy band ( e.g. at the ankle energy region , see subsequent figures 11 and 12 ) .",
    "figure 8 shows the proton energy spectrum with a spectral index of 2.6 , based on the atic experiment , at very low energy ( adams et al . , 2005 ) , normalized to the flux of @xmath18 particles/@xmath1 @xmath19@xmath20 @xmath21 , measured by the kascade collaboration ( roth et al . , 2003 ) at the energy of @xmath22 @xmath1 .",
    "the computed spectrum conforms fairly well to the measurements ; taking a soft spectral index ( for example , 2.72 ) instead of a hard one , the agreement with the experimental data becomes excellent .",
    "the energy spectrum obtained by the sibyll algorithm in kascade gives a similar accord , since the resulting spectra almost shift in parallel manner in intensity .",
    "note that the mentioned shift in intensity is absorbed in the normalization , so preserving the accord .    in figure 9",
    "are given the computed helium and iron spectra ( thick lines ) compared with the experimental data of kascade and eas - top collaborations ( navarra et al .",
    ", 2003 ) . in this case",
    ", the helium spectral index of 2.72 has been used and the traditional value of 2.5 for iron ( mueller , 1989 ) , as measured at low energy .",
    "the helium - to - iron flux ratio of 3.75 at the normalization energy of @xmath22 @xmath1 has been imposed using the data from the kascade collaboration ( roth et al . , 2003 ) .",
    "comparing the computed helium spectra in figures 8 and 9 ( thick lines in both figures ) , which have different spectral indices of 2.6 and 2.72 , a visual quantification of the general effect of the indices on the intrinsic spectra given in figure 5 , may be appreciated . the global agreement with the measured h ,",
    "he and fe spectra is more than satisfactory .",
    "the complete spectrum of the cosmic radiation is the sum of the partial spectra of the individual ions .",
    "figure 10 shows an example of partial spectra for six ions .",
    "the indices and elemental abundances of these energy spectra are those reported in table 2 , blend 3 .",
    "the regular , smooth spectra displayed in figure 5 , which have ( artificial ) equal abundances at the sources , transform into those shown in figure 10 , which are scattered in intensity , due to the uneven chemical composition and differing spectral indices , ranging from 2.60 to 2.72 .    in figures 11 and 12 the complete energy spectra for the ion blend 2 , in the interval @xmath7-@xmath8 @xmath1 ,",
    "are given , along with the data of some groups : tibet and haverah park experiments in figure 11 ( amenomori , 1996 ; lawrence , 1990 ) akeno and agasa experiments in figure 12 ( hara , 1979 ; nagano , 1992 ) .",
    "the computed spectrum is required to agree with the experimental data only at one energy point , at the arbitrary energy of @xmath23 @xmath1 and no other constraint is imposed . for sake of completeness , at the energy of @xmath23 @xmath1 , the intensity ratio of the complete spectra between tibet and kascade experiments is taken 1.4 while that between akeno and kascade 0.65 .",
    "the overall accord is fairly good , and in particular , the spectral index @xmath14 of 3.06 for this ion blend 2 in the energy interval @xmath24-@xmath6 @xmath1 is in excellent agreement with the data of the quoted experiments and many others .",
    "the other ion blends 1 and 3 give similar results for @xmath14 , 3.05 and 3.0 , respectively , as reported in table 2 .    in the present investigation of the energy spectrum between the knee and the ankle , the traditional hypothesis ( see , for example , rossi b. , 1964 )",
    "is admitted that a fraction of the sources powering the flux at earth might not be located in the disc volume .",
    "let us call these sources extradisc rather than extragalactic since there are claims of sources placed in the halo ( hillas , 1998 ; dar , 2001 ; plaga , 2003 ) . in the next section",
    "it is demonstrated that the expected extradisc flux , if any , has to peak between the energies of @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xmath1 , namely , the minimum ( for protons ) and maximum energies ( for fe ) attesting the rectilinear propagation of cosmic rays in the milky way . incorporating this anticipated result here , the extradisc component ( @xmath27 ) is normalized at the energy of @xmath28 @xmath1 .",
    "the normalization requires that the sum of the extradisc and galactic intensity at earth ( @xmath29 ) equals the observed value of @xmath30 particles/@xmath1 @xmath19@xmath20 @xmath21 as measured by the haverah park experiment ( figure 11 ) or by @xmath31 particles/@xmath1 @xmath19@xmath20 @xmath21 as measured by agasa collaboration ( figure 12 ) .",
    "it is found that ( @xmath29+@xmath27)/@xmath27 is about 3.6 in figure 11 and ( @xmath29+@xmath27)/@xmath27 about 2.5 in figure 12 .",
    "the energy spectra of the extradisk component are determined by taking into account the modification of the energy spectra and ion blends ( with respect to those given in table 2 ) experienced by the galactic cosmic rays overflowing from the galaxy and the analogous modifications suffered by the extragalactic cosmic rays penetrating the milky way from its exterior and reaching the solar cavity .",
    "details of this developement will be given at the cris catania conference 2006 ( codino and plouin , 2006 ) .",
    "consider the extreme simplified condition of galactic and extragalactic cosmic rays represented in figure 13 .",
    "galactic sources are represented by diverging arrows while the disc and halo by slabs of matter with appropriate thicknesses .",
    "the slab thickness , @xmath32 , is the average distance experienced by cosmic rays in the travel from a ( fictitious ) average disc source to the solar cavity ( circle ) and likewise @xmath33 for extragalactic cosmic rays .",
    "the disc grammage @xmath34 ( in @xmath34/@xmath35 ) is defined as @xmath36@xmath37@xmath38 where @xmath37 is the average atomic mass in the disc , @xmath37 is the number density of atoms , @xmath38 the mean trajectory length , and likewise @xmath39 for the halo grammage .",
    "the corresponding average matter densities experienced by galactic and extragalactic ions are : @xmath40=@xmath34/@xmath32 and @xmath41=@xmath39/@xmath33 , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath32 and @xmath33 are constant lengths which disappear from the final formulae .",
    "galactic sources emanate cosmic rays which propagate through the disc and beyond its border .",
    "some of these ions are destroyed by nuclear collisions in the disk , some others evade into the halo , and only a tiny fraction arrives to the solar cavity .",
    "similar partitions of the flux should occur for the extragalactic component ( bottom part of figure 13 ) with the only difference that the slab thickness , @xmath33 , is a bit higher than that experienced by galactic cosmic rays .",
    "this is due to the larger size of the traversed medium .",
    "the matter densities of these barriers ( or the grammages @xmath34 and @xmath39 ) certainly vary with the energy as qualitatively shown in figure 14 .",
    "going from low to very high energy , at about @xmath42 @xmath1 , the grammage must reduce to a minimum value which is attained as cosmic rays propagate rectilinearly .",
    "the intensity at earth of the extragalactic component is simply determined by the nuclear cross section and the grammage . as an example , figure 15 displays the helium - proton cross section , which rises with energy , and the helium grammage @xmath39 versus energy .",
    "the average minimum energy at which cosmic rays penetrate unbent the interstellar medium and the halo , marks the onset of the rectililear propagation and in this condition a minimum grammage is attained .",
    "the characteristic energy value at which this occurs , at @xmath43 @xmath1 for helium , is due to the average strength of the magnetic field in the milky way and the charge of the ion .",
    "the number of particles surviving the barrier , those arriving at earth , is governed by the attenuation length , @xmath44 , equal to @xmath15/@xmath45@xmath41@xmath46 in the ratio @xmath33/@xmath44 where @xmath46 is the avogadro number and @xmath15 the average mass of the galactic atom .",
    "the product @xmath33@xmath45 @xmath41 , or more simply @xmath45@xmath39 , has necessarily a minimum , shown in figure 16 , because of the forms of the curves shown in figure 15 .",
    "but the minimum of the barrier density corresponds to the maximum penetration of the barrier , which in turn , translates in an intensity maximum for the extradisc component . repeating this calculation for iron",
    "the intensity maximum is at @xmath26 @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , in the energy band , from @xmath47 to @xmath48 @xmath1 an intensity maximum is expected , being the ankle energy for protons at about @xmath25 @xmath1 , a bit lower than that of helium at @xmath49 @xmath1 .",
    "accurate measurements of the hires collaboration in the energy band @xmath42-@xmath9 @xmath1 do actually indicate an intensity bump in this region ( springer et al . , 2003 ) .",
    "other experiments ( haverah park , yakutsk , agasa ) register a similar intensity bump with respect to the extrapolation of the spectrum , at constant spectral index , measured at lower energies , below @xmath50 @xmath1 .",
    "this inference and the conclusion for the existence of an intensity bump are independent , within plausible empirical limits , from the ion blend and the spectral indices of the extragalactic component , and to a large extent , from the method of calculation .",
    "the uneven efficiency of the magnetic field to retain cosmic rays in the galaxy at high energies , above @xmath51 @xmath1 , is insufficient to account for the knees of the individual ions and for the knee .",
    "this decreasing efficiency would yield an enhancement or a depression of the flux at earth , depending on the nuclear species and the particular energy .",
    "it is only by the detailed analysis of the effects of nuclear cross sections , the position of the solar cavity and the disc size on cosmic ray flux at earth that the origin of the knees and ankles becomes fully comprehensible .",
    "figure 17 shows the number of galactic iron nuclei @xmath52 crossing the disc border ( top curve ) and that of galactic iron nuclei reaching the earth ( bottom curve ) versus energy , exactly in the same conditions .",
    "the break of @xmath52 caused by the magnetic field occurs , in both cases , precisely around and above @xmath53 @xmath1 , but the effect on the iron intensity measurable by a terrestrial or a peripheral instrument is opposite : in one case there is a knee , in the other an antiknee .",
    "this behavior vividly illustrates the importance of the position of the earth within the galaxy .",
    "\\(1 ) the energy spectra of proton , helium and iron nuclei fairly well match those measured by the kascade and eas - top experiments ; ( 2 ) the computed knee of the complete spectrum is also in agreement with the experimental data ; this agreement is substantiated by the correct bend energy , between @xmath54 @xmath1 , and the correct spectral index of 3 above @xmath4 @xmath1 ( see figures 11 and 12 and their legends ) .",
    "( 3 ) the positions of the ankles and knees along the energy axis are distinctively and uniquely interconnected by the average magnetic field strength , which forges the grammage , and by the rate at which inelastic cross sections rise with energy , as shown in figure 15 .",
    "this fundamental conclusion corroborates the explanation of the knees and ankles described in section 3 and 4 .",
    "it seems to us that the coherent set of observational facts and related physical processes , affecting the propagation of galactic cosmic rays in the disk , as described in sections 2 and 3 , form the irreducible basis for any further quantitative exploration of the knees and ankles of the cosmic radiation .",
    "this quantitative exploration is probably feasible using other simulation codes ( see , for example , moskalenko , 1997 ) ."
