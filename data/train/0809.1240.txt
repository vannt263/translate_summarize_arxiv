    "the photophysics of dilute solutions and thin films of @xmath0-conjugated polymers ( pcps ) are often remarkably different @xcite .",
    "it is generally accepted that solutions exhibit behavior characteristic of single strands , and the different behavior of films is due to interchain interaction and disorder .",
    "microscopic understanding of the effects of interchain interaction has remained incomplete even after intensive investigations . as discussed below , to a large extent this",
    "is because the experimental results themselves , or their interpretations are controversial and confusing .",
    "theoretical investigations of the effects of interchain interactions @xcite have until now focused largely on the lowest interchain species near the optical edge , and the role of such interchain species on the emissive behavior of films .",
    "the goal of this work is to re - examine interchain interaction in pcps within a semi - empirical hamiltonian with realistic parameters , focusing on ultrafast photoinduced absorption ( pa ) measurements and related experimental results that appear to be mutually contradictory .",
    "we show that theoretical understanding of _ excited states _ of interchain species is crucial for this purpose .",
    "the interchain species we will be interested in have been discussed by numerous authors over the years , and the nomenclature has sometimes been confusing .",
    "it is therefore important to fix the nomenclature before we begin",
    ". we will refer to intrachain neutral excitations as _ excitons _ , independent of their binding energy . at the other extreme",
    "are the _ polaron - pairs _ , which consist of two _ completely ionic charged chains _ , one positive and one negative .",
    "since we consider nonzero interchain coulomb interactions , and since we will be discussing two - chain systems only , the polaron - pair states are necessarily bound by coulomb interactions . for nonzero",
    "electron hopping between the chains , eigenstates that are superpositions of the intrachain exciton and the polaron - pair are obtained .",
    "we will refer to these superpositions as _ charge - transfer excitons _",
    ", hereafter ct excitons .",
    "the reader should note that the polaron - pair has been sometimes referred to as the charge - transfer exciton in the literature .",
    "@xcite the ct excitons , in their turn , have sometimes been called excimers .",
    "@xcite our nomenclature is based on the most common useage of these terms , and we give precise quantum - mechanical definitions of these interchain species in section iv . one major difference between the work presented here and",
    "the existing literature is that we are also interested in _ higher energy excited polaron - pairs and ct excitons _ , which are defined exactly as above ( thus , a high energy ct exciton is predominantly a superposition of a similar high energy excited intrachain exciton and polaron - pair ) .",
    "we find a 1:1 correspondence between the `` essential states '' that determine the photophysics of single strands @xcite and the dominant excited states including excited interchain species , that determine the photophysics of interacting chains .",
    "starting from a microscopic @xmath0-electron hamiltonian , we investigate the energy spectrum of interacting pcp chains .",
    "we do not attempt to understand details of the photoluminescence ( pl ) , which can be understood to a large extent within existing theories .",
    "@xcite understanding delayed emission in pcp films ( see below ) , on the other hand , will require much more sophisticated modeling .",
    "we rather focus on the theory of excited state absorption in interacting chains , with the goal of understanding the observed branching of photoexcitations and the origin of the polaronlike photoinduced absorptions ( pas ) , @xcite and experiments that indicate that in spite of the occurrence of these polaronlike pas free charges are not generated as primary photoexcitations .",
    "@xcite    in the next section we present a brief yet detailed summary of relevant experiments in pcp films that indicate the strong role of interchain interactions , highlighting in particular the apparently contradictory observations . following this , in section",
    "iii we present our theoretical model . in section",

    "pl from regioregular polythiophene ( rrp3ht ) has recently been discussed within a weak - coupling h - aggregate model , within which dipole - dipole coupling leads to an exciton band .",
    "@xcite absorption here is to the highest state in the exciton band while emission is from the lowest state .",
    "@xcite conversely , it has been claimed that pl from films of cyano - poly(paraphenylenevinylene ) , cn - ppv , and poly(2-methoxy,5-(2@xmath1-ethyl - hexyloxy)1,4 paraphenylenevinylene ) , meh - ppv , are from ct excitons that occur below the intrachain optical exciton .",
    "@xcite formation of ct excitons requires that polaron - pairs are energetically proximate to the excitons ( see section iv and appendix ) .",
    "the occurrence of low energy polaron - pairs is indicated by the observation of `` persistent '' or delayed pl lasting until milliseconds in films , the electric field quenching of the delayed pl , and the resumption of the pl upon removal of the field .",
    "@xcite    experiments that also indicate the strong role of interchain interactions , and that are even more difficult to understand than pl involve transient absorption . two distinct ultrafast photoinduced absorptions ( pas )",

    "the mechanism by which such ultrafast generation can occur is not clear .",

    "the authors initially assigned the new low energy pa at @xmath3 0.350.4 ev , labeled p@xmath2 , and the higher energy pa , labeled p@xmath4 in this work , to absorptions of free polarons that according to the authors are generated when interchain interactions are strong .",
    "the high energy pa associated with films had been previously observed in meh - ppv , @xcite and it has been ascribed to absorptions from free polarons as well as from polaron - pairs .",
    "@xcite interestingly , these pas peculiar to films are generated instantaneously , suggesting branching of photoexcitations with competing channels generating excitons and polarons .",
    "such branching of photoexcitations would be in agreement with previous claim of the observation of infrared active vibrations ( irav ) in meh - ppv in fs time , @xcite but is difficult to reconcile with the large exciton binding energies deduced from pa@xmath2 energy , @xcite which requires that polarons are generated from dissociation of the exciton due to extraneous influence at a later time .",
    "instantaneous irav @xcite has not been observed by other experimentalists , and interpretations other than those given by the original authors exist in the literature .",
    "@xcite in the context of sheng _ et al s _ experiment , the following is , however , true : if the p@xmath2 absorption , as well as the high energy absorption absent in solutions are indeed due to polarons , irav associated with these absorptions should have been observed .",
    "intriguingly , sheng _",
    "et al . _ in their experiments did not find any irav at room temperatures that should have accompanied the p@xmath2 absorption , and very weak irav at 80 k. @xcite later more careful attempts have also failed to detect room temperature irav .",
    "@xcite    the absence of room temperature irav suggests that polarons are _ not _ being generated in sheng _",

    "this conclusion is in apparent agreement with microwave conductivity measurements @xcite and thz spectrscopy @xcite that have found negligible polaron generation upon direct photoexcitation in both solutions and films .",

    "we only point out that the @xmath78 and 19 states , in spite of their intermediate ionicities , are predominantly polaron - pair , based on their strong overlaps with even superpositions of high energy charged configurations .",
    "the strong mixing between intrachain and interchain basis functions in this region is a signature that this energy region is close to the continuum band .",
    "@xcite    to summarize this subsection , characterizations of eigenstates as predominantly intrachain exciton , ct exciton and polaron - pair continues to be valid even in the presence of disorder , although they become less appropriate at higher energies .      besides energies and ionicities , tables i and ii also list the transition dipole couplings of excited states with the ground state , and between the excited states themselves .",

    "there is very little difference between the different cases ( except that in the symmetric cases the ct exciton has zero transition dipole coupling with the ground state ) .",
    "pa@xmath2 in the single chain corresponds to the transition from the 1b@xmath5 to the ma@xmath62 .",
    "the initial and final states of pa@xmath80 absorptions in the two - chain systems are both ct excitons .",
    "the p@xmath2 absorption , missing in the single chain , is from the lowest ct exciton to the lowest polaron - pair .",
    "the calculated pas for the two - chain system are _ excited state equivalents _ of the absorptions expected within the classic mulliken theory of weak donor - acceptor complexes . in a donor - acceptor complex , there occurs weak ct absorption at low energy , in addition to the molecular absorptions .",

    "the inset shows schematically the arrangement of the oligomers , with the ends matching on one side only .",

    "_ , @xcite and more recently , singh _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have also discussed a higher energy pa , above pa@xmath80 , peculiar to films .",
    "it is believed @xcite that this high energy pa is the same that was observed very early in meh - ppv .",
    "@xcite as discussed before in the context of the pa@xmath4 absorption in single chains , @xcite such high energy regions can not be investigated within the sci approximation , and higher order ci calculations become essential . such calculations for pairs of ppv oligomers is beyond our capability currently . on the other hand ,",
    "as emphasized in section iv.a , the photophysics of the ct exciton in pcps can be anticipated even from the behavior of coupled ehtylene molecules .",
    "we have performed fci calculations for pairs of ethylene and butadiene molecules and have indeed detected a high energy two - electron two - hole polaron - pair state @xmath86 to which absorption from the ct exciton is allowed . in the notation of section iii ,",
    "the components of this state for the coupled ethylene system are , @xmath87|0 \\rangle\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] @xmath88|0 \\rangle\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] each polaron - pair configuration now has two components , related by electron - hole symmetry . in figs .",
    "3(a ) and ( b ) we have shown the four spin bonded vb diagrams that describe this high energy polaron - pair state .",
    "the diagrams are similar for coupled butadienes , with the only difference that there occur now bonding ( antibonding ) mos below ( above ) the bonding ( antibonding ) mos of fig.3 .",
    "it is easy to see why charge - transfer absorption to this state from the ct exciton is allowed for nonzero @xmath24 . within the exciton representation such an absorption originates from interunit charge - transfer from either frontier mo of one unit to either frontier mo of the second unit .",
    "@xcite one can then have low energy charge - transfer , from the occupied antibonding mos of the intrachain excitons in fig .",
    "1(a ) to the unoccupied antibonding mos of the neighboring unit , creating the low energy polaron - pair state discussed in section iv.a .",
    "this is the p@xmath2 absorption .",
    "in addition , it is possible to have transition from the the singly occupied ( doubly occupied ) bonding mo of one unit of the forbidden exciton to the unoccupied ( singly occupied ) antibonding mo of the neighboring unit .",
    "this second transition is clearly at higher energy , and gives the excited polaron - pair states of figs .",
    "3(a ) and ( b ) . in spite of the basic similarity between ground state and excited state charge - transfer",
    ", there then does exist one fundamental difference between them , viz .",
    ", multiple charge - transfer absorptions will occur in the latter case , as opposed to a single absorption in the former .",
    "one possible criticism of the work presented above might be that the calculations are for finite oligomers and therefore they may not apply to infinite chains .",
    "different research groups have shown , for instance , that within the dipole - dipole interaction model the splitting between the optical and the dark exciton vanishes in the infinite chain length .",
    "@xcite we point out the following in this context .",
    "first , the dipole - dipole interaction model is valid only when the polaron - pair configuration is ignored ( @xmath89 limit ) . for reasonable @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the stabilization of the dark exciton comes predominantly from ci with the polaron - pair ( see appendix ) .",
    "second , real pcps are not true infinite chains and usually consist of a distribution of conjugation lengths that are close to what we have considered here . @xcite",
    "as seen in the appendix , the energy gap between the optical and the ct exciton does indeed decrease with size , but there is a broad region over which this gap is nearly the same .",
    "third , and most important in the present context , it is not the gap between the optical exciton and the ct exciton , but rather , _ the gap between the polaron - pair and the ct exciton , _ that is relevant for our theory .",
    "we show in the appendix that this second gap , corresponding to the p@xmath2 transition energy , increases weakly with increasing size .",
    "our work provides the insight necessary to understand the various mutually contradictory experimental results",
    ". there occur in pcps a series of interchain ct excitons and polaron - pairs in the energy space below the continuum band .",
    "the lowest ct exciton occurs below the optical exciton , and its wavefunction is a superposition of ( a ) the wavefunction of the lowest state in the exciton band of a h - aggregate , and ( b ) the lowest polaron - pair state of odd parity .",
    "the disorder - induced 0 - 0 emission , as well as the 0 - 1 emission from the lowest h - aggregate state and from the ct exciton are therefore very likely similar , since the polaron - pair component of the ct exciton has no dipole coupling with the ground state and should not interfere in the emission process .",
    "the success of the h - aggregate model in explaining the pl of rrp3ht @xcite therefore does not contradict the ct exciton scenario .",
    "as emphasized by others , @xcite probing at a variety of wavelengths is essential for understanding the complete role of morphology .    whether or not significant ct occurs in real systems depends on the magnitude of @xmath24 and the relative energies of the dark exciton and the polaron - pair in the absence of @xmath24 .",
    "the demonstration of delocalized two - dimensional polarons in rrp3ht @xcite proves that @xmath24 should be large enough for interchain electron hopping .",
    "similar large @xmath24 has been assumed in calculations for cn - ppv and meh - ppv @xcite .",
    "as mentioned already , delayed pl in films is cited as evidence for some polaron - pairs occurring even below the optical exciton @xcite ( it is not being implied that these polaron - pairs are generated in photoexcitation . ) this would suggest that even though the bulk of the polaron - pairs are above the exciton , they are proximate in energy ( see also appendix ) . taken together , moderate @xmath24 and relatively low energy polaron - pairs",
    "indicates significant charge - transfer .    within our theory , pa in films",
    "is from both the ct exciton and the optical exciton at the earliest times , and predominantly from the ct exciton following this .",
    "the similarity between the two - chain pa in fig .  2 and the low energy part of the experimental pa spectra of by sheng _",
    "@xcite is striking .",
    "pa@xmath2 in solutions is the absorption from the single - chain 1b@xmath5 to the ma@xmath62 . as in sheng _",
    "experiment for solutions , the p@xmath2 absorption is missing in our single chain calculation . the p@xmath2 absorption in films , however , is not from free polarons , but is a charge - transfer absorption from the lowest ct exciton to the lowest polaron - pair .",
    "pa in the 1 ev range in solutions and films appear to be identical but have slightly different origins : in films this is the pa@xmath80 absorption from the lowest ct exciton to a higher energy ct exciton in the ma@xmath62 - manifold .",
    "the branching of photoexcitations , as discussed by sheng _",
    "_ , is real , and the instantaneous generation of p@xmath2 is likely a consequence of the ct exciton being weakly allowed in absorption due to disorder .",
    "our theory is a straightforward extension of mulliken s theory of ground state charge - transfer in a donor - acceptor complex @xcite to the case of photoinduced charge - transfer in pcp films . as in mullken",
    "s theory , there occur from the ct exciton charge - transfer absorptions ( viz . ,",
    "p@xmath2 in fig .",
    "2 ) absent in the pure `` molecular '' components , in addition to the weakly perturbed `` molecular absorption '' pa@xmath80 .",
    "our interpretation of p@xmath2 explains the absence of room temperature irav in sheng _",
    "et al s _ photoexcitation experiment , since free charges are not generated",
    ". the weak low temperature irav may owe its origin to the polaron - pair contributions to the ct exciton wavefunction . in the disordered case ,",
    "the contributions by @xmath70 and @xmath90 , and by @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively , to the ct exciton are different , and this asymmetry may make weak irav possible . this is currently being investigated .",
    "the apparent contradiction between ultrafast spectroscopy on the one hand , and microwave @xcite and thz spectroscopy @xcite on the other , is also understandable once it is recognized that p@xmath2 is not associated with polarons .",
    "the pa@xmath4 seen in solutions is a second higher energy `` molecular absorption '' , and from the above extension of mulliken theory , we expect a weakly perturbed pa@xmath91 absorption in films .",
    "we have not tried to directly evaluate this pa , as even in single chains the understanding of pa@xmath4 requires highly sophisticated many - body calculations . @xcite",
    "similar calculations are currently beyond our reach for the two - chain case , but the results of tables i and ii indicate that the interchain species that is the final state of pa@xmath91 must exist . more interesting",
    "is the higher energy pa peculiar to films and absent in solutions .",
    "@xcite we have not calculated this higher energy pa for ppv oligomers , but have determined that such an absorption from the ct exciton is found in fci calculations on coupled ethylene and butadiene chains .",
    "the analogy between coupled ethylenes and long pcp chains pointed out in section iv suggest that similar high energy two electron - two hole polaron - pair state will exist also in arbitrary pcps . based on the very slow polarization memory decay kinetics ,",
    "the high energy pa associated with films has recently been ascribed to absorption from the ct exciton , @xcite in agreement with our prediction .",
    "our calculations allow us to make predictions for polarizations of the pas .",
    "we predict that pa@xmath80 in films will be polarized along the pcp chains , and that p@xmath2 will be polarized transverse to the chains .",
    "preliminary polarization memory measurements are in agreement with these predictions , but more careful measurements have to be performed to confirm that the pas are from the same species .",
    "@xcite finally , ct excitons have also been claimed in recent experiments on dendritic oligothiophenes @xcite and in pentacene films .",
    "@xcite    while the present theoretical work has focused entirely on single - component pcps , several experimental groups have recently discussed charge - transfer complexes ( ctcs ) created upon photoexcitations of heterstructures composed of donors and acceptors . @xcite the donor - acceptor polaron - pair as well as the ctc here",
    "are expected and found below the optical gaps of the donor as well as the acceptor",
    ". theoretical work on excited state absorptions from the ctcs @xcite is of interest and is currently being pursued .",

    "the plots for @xmath93 and @xmath94 are not completely independent . as seen in the figure ,",
