    "compounds with strong geometrical frustration of magnetic bonds have attracted much attention due to the unusual properties of their manifold ground states and their peculiar spin dynamics . for some systems",
    "the degeneracy of the ground state is infinite ( in the nearest neighbor exchange approximation ) , which leads to ( i ) delayed magnetic ordering and a wide temperature interval with a short - range correlated state , the so called cooperative paramagnet,@xcite and to ( ii ) an enhanced role for the weaker interactions in the eventual formation of a long - range order state at low temperature .",
    "different mechanisms for lifting the macroscopic degeneracy and selecting a specific ground state is a matter of individual consideration for each system . in the case of pyrochlore magnets , ( nearly ) fully ordered states , cooperative paramagnetic states , spin - glass and spin - ice states have all been observed in different materials.@xcite    experimental investigations of excitation spectra often provide the only viable method of determining a specific set of interactions to be taken into account for an individual magnetic compound .",
    "for example , in a heisenberg pyrochlore magnet @xmath7 , where the four - sublattice structure with @xmath8 ( a so - called plane cross or a palmer - chalker state ) is found at low temperature,@xcite the spin - wave calculations performed for this type of ordering with known microscopic parameters of exchange , dipolar interactions and a single - ion anisotropy  @xcite are in perfect agreement with the experimentally obtained picture , thus demonstrating the validity of this description .    unlike the gd - based heisenberg pyrochlores , erbium titanate @xmath0has a strong local xy - type anisotropy of magnetic moments due to the large orbital momentum of er@xmath9 ions ( @xmath10 ) which is not quenched by the crystal field .",

    "depending on the temperature interval of data fitting , the value of @xmath11 varies from -13  k in the higher temperature limit 80 - 300  k  @xcite to -22  k if determined from data collected at temperatures below 50  k.@xcite @xmath0  is known to undergo a second order transition to a long - range ordered state at about 1.2  k.@xcite a spherical neutron polarimetry experiment indicates that the magnetic structure is formed from six domains , all of which are equally occupied.@xcite in addition , recent high resolution neutron diffraction measurements detect the coexistence of short and long - range order.@xcite low - lying excitation modes ungapped in zero field and near a critical field of about 15  koe are also observed in this experiment .",
    "muon spin - relaxation measurements show non - vanishing spin dynamics as the temperature approaches zero,@xcite in contrast to the expectations for a conventional magnet .",
    "the non - coplanar structure appearing below @xmath12 is presumed to be induced by fluctuations,@xcite but this model predicts a strong first - order phase transition , while experimentally it is found to be continuous . a mean field model which includes single - ion anisotropy and anisotropic exchange interactions is capable of producing the required long - range order,@xcite however thermal or quantum fluctuations",

    "the plates were mounted in such a way that the magnetic field was applied in the sample plane in order to minimize the demagnetization effect .",

    "this limit is especially rigid because of their large magnetic permeability .",

    "this background signal grows in amplitude on approaching the nel temperature and finally replaces the three lines of the low - temperature spectrum . comparing the spectra recorded at various frequencies",
    "one finds that the background is excited only by the microwave field component directed along the external magnetic field .",
    "therefore , the absorption is associated with the longitudinal oscillation of the magnetic moment and should be damped in the vicinity of the field at which the magnetization reaches its maximum value .",
    "a similar effect was observed in the heisenberg pyrochlore system @xmath17  where the longitudinal susceptibility was supposed to result from a partial disorder of the magnetic ground state.@xcite as in the present case , this mode had very strong relaxation ( of unknown origin ) which makes it impossible to observe other than in the form of a broad non - resonant background vanishing above the saturation field . approximating the system as a set of `` rigid '' sublattices canted to the magnetic field , one obtains the slow response of the system to the microwave field to be @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is an angle between the sublattice and the field .",
    "since the total magnetization of the system is @xmath54 ( @xmath55 is a maximum magnetization ) , the resulting contribution of such a degree of freedom to the dynamic susceptibility of the sample can be estimated as @xmath56 ( @xmath4 is a critical field ) .",
