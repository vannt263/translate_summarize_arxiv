    "the classic risk model is based on the surplus process @xmath0 , where the insurer starts with the initial reserve @xmath1 and receives the premium at a constant rate @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the claims .",
    "a central problem is to study the ruin probability , i.e. , the probability that the surplus process will ever hit zero . in recent years , a dual risk model has attracted many attentions , in which the surplus process is modeled as @xmath4 where @xmath3 are i.i.d .",
    "positive random variables distributed according to @xmath5 independent of @xmath6 , which is a poisson process with intensity @xmath7 .",

    "the surplus can be interpreted as the wealth of a venture capital , whose profits depend on research and development . the profits are uncertain and modeled as a jump process and the costs are more predictable and are modeled as a deterministic process .",
    "the company pays expenses continuously over time for the research and development and gets profits at random discrete times in the future .",
    "many properties have been studied for the dual risk model .",
    "the ruin probability @xmath9 , where @xmath10 satisfies the equation , see e.g. afonso et al .",
    "@xcite @xmath11 it is well known that @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the unique positive solution to the equation : @xmath14    avanzi et al .",
    "@xcite worked on optimal dividends in the dual risk model where the wealth process follows a lvy process and the optimal strategy is a barrier strategy .",

    "@xcite studied a dual risk model with tax payments . for general interclaim time dsitributions and",
    "exponentially distributed @xmath3 s , an expression for the ruin probability with tax is obtained in terms of the ruin probability without taxation . when the interclaim times are exponential or mixture of exponentials , explicit expressions are obtained .",
    "ng @xcite considered a dual model with a threshold dividend strategy , with exponential interclaim times .",
    "afonso et al .",
    "@xcite worked on dividend problem in the dual risk model , assuming exponential interclaim times .",
    "they presented a new approach for the calculation of expected discounted dividends . and studied ruin and dividend probabilities , number of dividends , time to a dividend . and the distribution for the amount of single dividends .",
    "avanzi et al .",
    "@xcite studied a dividend barrier strategy for the dual risk model whereby dividend decisions are made only periodically , but still allow ruin to occur at any time .",
    "cheung @xcite studied the laplace transform of the time of recovery after default , amongst other concepts for a dual risk model .",
    "cheung and drekic @xcite studied dividend moments in the dual risk model .",
    "they derived integro - differential equations for the moments of the total discounted dividends which can be solved explicitly assuming the jump size distribution has a rational laplace transform .",
    "rodrguez et al .",
    "@xcite worked on a dual risk model with erlang interclaim times , studied the ruin probability , the laplace transform of the time of ruin for generally distributed @xmath3 s .",

    "when the profits are phase type distributed , ng @xcite also studied the cross probabilities .",
    "yang and sendova @xcite studied the laplace transform of the ruin time , expected discounted dividends for the sparre - andersen dual model .",
    "the dual risk model has also been used in the context of venture capital investments and some optimization problems have been studied , see e.g. bayraktar and egami @xcite . in fahim and zhu @xcite , they studied the optimal control problem for the dual risk model , which is the minimization of the ruin probability of the underlying company by optimizing over the investment in research and development .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a state - dependent dual risk model .",
    "the innovations of a company may have self - exciting phenomena , i.e. , an innovation or breakthrough will increase the chance of the next innovation and breakthrough .",
    "also , when the wealth process increases , the company will be in a better shape to innovate and hence the arrival rate of the profits , may depend on the state of the wealth rather than simply being poisson . also , the expenses that a company pays for research and develop may also increase after the company receive more profits . for the high tech and fast - growing companies , the running cost and the revenues of a company grow in line with the size of the company , see e.g. table [ google ] , where we considered the annual total revenues , cost of total revenues and the gross profits in the years 2011 - 2014 .",
    "we can see the upward trend of growth for google .",
    "therefore , for a high tech company for google , the usual constant assumption for running cost , the intensity of profits arrivals in the dual risk model might be too simplistic .",
    "on the other hand , for a traditional company like coca - cola , the annual total revenues , cost of total revenues and the gross profits do not vary too much year over year , see e.g. table [ ko ] , where we considered the annual total revenues , cost of total revenues and the gross profits in the years 2011 - 2014 . that might also be the pattern for a high tech company that has already matured and no longer has stellar growth .",
    "therefore , the dual risk model in the existing literature might be a good model when the financials of a company do not change too much over time",
    ". a state - dependent dual risk model might be more appropriate when the underlying company has phenomenal growth .",
