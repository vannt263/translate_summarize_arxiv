    "recent years have seen the emergence of a strong interest in exploiting the manipulation of the spin degrees of freedom in solid state systems that could lead to enhanced performance in electronic devices ; this field of spin electronics , or simply spintronics @xcite , has evolved into an exciting subject in condensed matter physics . among the myriad of spintronics proposals ,",
    "gate - controlled rashba spin - orbit ( so ) coupling has attracted tremendous attention as it offers the possibility of all - electrical spin manipulation without the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "one such experimentally realizable heterostructure is a double quantum well gate - modulated with rashba spin - orbit coupling . in this paper , we study theoretically the effect of spin - orbit coupling on the coulomb drag properties of 2d bilayer systems .",
    "as is well known , there exists coulomb coupling between the barrier - separated two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) layers induced by the momentum exchanges of the coulomb - scattered electrons residing in individual layers .",
    "this phenomenon of coulomb drag ( in the absence of spin - orbit coupling ) , first observed experimentally by gramila _",
    "et al_. @xcite between two 2deg layers , has continued to be a subject of thorough investigation @xcite ; with a theoretical description developed in refs .",
    "the physical mechanism at work in coulomb drag can be understood as follows : the application of a current through one layer ( the active layer ) causes thermal fluctuations in the electron density , which are transferred across the barrier to the other layer ( the passive layer ) due to momentum exchanges by electron - electron scattering . in the passive layer",
    ", the variations in electrical potential associated with the thermal fluctuations in electron density then produce a current due to second - order rectification effect , quantified by the nonlinear susceptibility which is the response function connecting the random potential fluctuations and the induced electrical current .",
    "the drag resistivity @xmath0 , which is defined as @xmath2  the ratio of the electric field strength developed in the open - circuited passive layer to the current density in the active layer , is a useful experimental measure of the coulomb drag phenomenon .",
    "although the subject of coulomb drag has existed since the first experiment more than a decade ago , it remains a very vibrant research topic today : recent experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies have revealed that bilayer hole drag in the low density regime is a factor of @xmath3 larger than the corresponding electron drag .",
    "moreover , other more recent experiments @xcite have shown that the low - density bilayer hole drag in the presence of an in - plane magnetic field ( i.e. magnetodrag ) has a qualitative dependence on the applied magnetic field unexpectedly similar to that of the single - layer magnetoresistivity , and this surprising observation has been accounted for theoretically by properly considering the suppression of screening by carrier spin polarization within the framework of the standard fermi - liquid theory @xcite . in light of these recent developments ,",
    "a very interesting question is whether spin - orbit coupling ( which is effectively a momentum - dependent in - plane magnetic field ) would change the qualitative behaviour of the drag resistivity . to our knowledge",
    ", the effect of spin - orbit coupling on coulomb drag has not yet been investigated , and this problem is highly relevant in view of the current growing interest in viable semiconductor spintronic systems and especially potential device applications employing gate - controlled spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the bilayer coulomb drag provides direct quantitative information about carrier interaction effects since the drag voltage in the passive layer arises entirely due to the carrier - carrier scattering between the layers .",
    "the study of bilayer coulomb drag properties in the presence of spin - orbit coupling effects therefore introduces a method of investigating the interplay between spin - orbit coupling and interaction effects .",
    "since both spin - orbit coupling and interaction can be tuned by applying external electric and magnetic fields respectively , and also by changing the 2d density , the possibility exists for a detailed understanding of the interplay between spin - orbit coupling and many - body interaction effects through bilayer drag studies .",
    "this is a main motivation for our theoretical work .    on the other hand",
    ", it has also been proposed that there exists an analogous effect , called the spin coulomb drag @xcite , in which spin - up and spin - down electrons within one single device structure ( three- or two - dimensional ) play the roles of the electrons in each individual layers in the charge coulomb drag problem , and now it is the coulomb scattering between the spin - up and spin - down carriers that causes the frictional force , damping the relative motion of the two spin components . therefore ,",
    "unlike ordinary charge current , the flow of opposite spin carriers ( i.e. spin current ) is a non - conserved quantity even without spin - orbit coupling and tends to be suppressed because of this drag effect . in the same spirit as @xmath0 ,",
    "one gains a measure of the spin drag by defining @xmath4 , the spin drag resistivity given by the ratio of the gradient of the electrochemical potential of spin - up carriers to the current density of the spin - down carriers , with the current of the spin - up carriers held zero .",
    "this effect has been confirmed in a recent experimental paper by weber _",
    "et al_. @xcite where it was found that the suppression of the measured spin diffusion coefficient relative to the charge diffusion coefficient could be explained by a correction factor @xmath5 coming from the theoretical spin drag prediction .",
    "we note that while the coulomb drag refers to a bilayer system , spin drag refers to a single 2d layer ( or a single 3d system ) with the up and down components of the spin playing the role of the `` active '' and `` passive '' carrier components .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to investigate the effect of spin - orbit interaction on the drag phenomenon in semiconductor structures including the usual ( charge ) coulomb drag and the spin coulomb drag .",
    "we follow refs .",
    "@xcite and apply diagrammatic perturbation theory to calculate the coulomb drag resistivity @xmath0 and spin coulomb drag resistivity @xmath1 in the presence of rashba so coupling .",
    "we find that for clean samples the coulomb drag resistivity and the spin drag resistivity are enhanced by a correction factor @xmath6 in the presence of so coupling ( @xmath7 is the dimensionless spin - orbit coupling strength ) , whereas for dirty samples the spin - orbit coupling correction to the coulomb drag is essentially completely suppressed by disorder .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : we begin in section ii with the problem of coulomb drag , where after recapitulating a set of useful formulas related to rashba so coupling and coulomb drag we proceed to evaluate in both the ballistic limit ( subsection a ) and the diffusive limit ( subsection b ) the nonlinear susceptibility , the central quantity in the problem .",
    "these results are then used in subsection c to calculate the coulomb drag resistivity in the presence of rashba so coupling . with the aid of the formalism applied to the coulomb drag",
    ", we turn in section iii to the problem of spin coulomb drag and calculate the spin drag resistivity in the ballistic regime .",
    "finally conclusions are presented in section iv .",

    "solving then yields the fermi energy and fermi wavevectors in the presence of rashba so coupling : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the fermi energy and fermi wavevector without so coupling , here we also define the dimensionless spin - orbit coupling strength @xmath24 .",

    "our result eq .",
    "( [ eq39 ] ) is in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite in the absence of so coupling .",
    "we observe here that the presence of the so interaction also enhances the spin coulomb drag .",
    "we comment in passing that , in the diffusive regime , correlated impurity scattering has to be taken into account since the spin - up and spin - down electrons are scattered by the same set of impurities in the sample , as emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "we have not attempted to include the diffusive limit as the effect of correlated impurity scattering requires taking into account a different set of diagrams @xcite and is beyond the scope of the current paper . however , taking account of such correlated impurity scattering effect is expected to further enhance the spin coulomb drag in the presence of so coupling also .",
    "before concluding , we point out that our theory indicates rather small effect of so coupling on the coulomb and spin drag , at least in the weak so coupling regime considered in our work .",
    "the drag is either unaffected by the so coupling or is affected only in the quadratic order of the so coupling strength .",
    "so the signature of so coupling may not be easy to discern in experimental drag measurements .",
    "on the other hand , we do find that the so coupling enhances the bilayer coulomb drag by the factor @xmath144 $ ] in the ballistic regime , indicating that coulomb drag would be enhanced by the presence of the so coupling .",
    "this is actually consistent with the available experimental findings .",
    "in particular , the measured bilayer hole drag @xcite seems to be larger than the corresponding theoretical results @xcite even after the inclusion of many - body effects .",
    "since the so coupling is strong in gaas holes , the dimensionless so coupling strength @xmath145 could be large , particularly at the low experimental hole densities ( because the definition of @xmath7 involves the fermi velocity in the denominator ) .",
    "this could lead to an appreciable enhancement of the 2d coulomb drag for low density holes in the ballistic regime bringing experiment and theory closer together .",
    "unfortunately , we can not make any quantitative comments on this issue since our theory is explicitly a weak so coupling expansion .    in summary",
    ", we have calculated the coulomb drag resistivity of a double - layer 2deg system including spin - orbit coupling . in the diffusive limit",
    "we find that there is no change in the coulomb drag resistivity while in the ballistic limit we find the drag resistivity to be enhanced by a factor of @xmath144 $ ] .",
    "we also apply the formalism to the problem of spin coulomb drag and find that the spin drag resistivity in the ballistic limit is similarly enhanced as well .",
    "these enhancement effects in the ballistic regime are due to the so - induced enhancement to the nonlinear susceptibility in both the charge coulomb drag and spin coulomb drag .",
