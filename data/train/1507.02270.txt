    "our view of galaxy populations in the universe continues to be shaped by observational selection effects , particularly that of limiting surface brightness ( disney 1976 ) . in the field ,",
    "low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies exist in significant numbers ( e.g. ,  mcgaugh 1996 ) , but were largely unnoticed until the ccd imaging surveys of the 1980s ( see , e.g. ,  bothun et  al .",
    "recent observations have probed even deeper , to limiting surface brightnesses of @xmath4 mag arcsec@xmath5 , revealing galaxies of ever lower surface brightness .",
    "this was demonstrated most recently through deep wide - field imaging of the coma cluster ( van dokkum et  al .",
    "2015a ; vd15a , koda et  al .",
    "2015 ; k15 ) , which found a population of large ( = @xmath6 kpc ; i.e. , milky way - sized ) and extremely diffuse galaxies with central surface brightnesses @xmath7 .",
    "these objects preferentially ( but not exclusively ) populate the cluster outskirts , with follow - up spectroscopy confirming that at least one is located within coma ( van dokkum et  al .  2015b ; vd15b ) .    that such diffuse galaxies exist in a rich cluster like coma is a surprise . because of their low densities and shallow potential wells , lsb galaxies should be most vulnerable to tidal perturbations as they move through the cluster , making their lifetimes very short ( e.g. ,  moore et  al .",
    "repeated encounters with other galaxies and with the cluster potential can whittle away stars from these objects , feeding the diffuse intracluster light .",
    "complete tidal disruption may leave behind their high density nuclei , leading to the formation of ultracompact dwarf galaxies ( ucds ; bekki et  al .",
    "2003 ; pfeffer & baumgardt 2013 ) .",
    "how the large , diffuse galaxies in coma can survive this dynamically harsh environment is unclear , suggesting either that they may be falling into the cluster for the first time , or extremely dark matter dominated systems and thus more robust against tidal perturbations .",
    "finding such systems in the nearby virgo cluster would be of particular interest , since they would be close enough ( @xmath8 mpc ; mei et  al .",
    "2007 , blakeslee et  al .  2009 ) to resolve their stellar populations and study their structure in detail .",
    "large lsbs in virgo were first hinted at in photographic catalogs by sandage & binggeli ( 1984 ) ; deeper studies subsequently identified diffuse objects with @xmath7 and sizes @xmath9 1 kpc ( impey et  al .  1988 ; caldwell 2006 ) , somewhat less extreme than the coma objects .",

    "( ngvs ; ferrarese et  al .",
    "2012 ) , now allow us to search for systems at even lower surface brightness . here",
    "we report the discovery of three large , extremely diffuse lsbs found in our deep virgo imaging . with central surface brightnesses of @xmath10 and sizes of @xmath11 kpc , these objects are comparable in size to the vd15a coma objects , but even lower in surface brightness .",
    "all three objects are located in the inner 0.5 mpc of virgo , well within the virial radius ( @xmath12 mpc ; mclaughlin 1999 ) . with such extremely low surface brightnesses , and projected deep within the cluster potential , these objects give us an opportunity for up - close study of the lowest density galaxies found in the high density cluster environment .",
    "to search for ultra diffuse galaxies in virgo , we use our deep virgo imaging survey from cwru s burrell schmidt telescope ( mihos et  al .",
    "2005 and in preparation ) .",
    "this survey covers 15.1 ( 16.3 ) degree@xmath13 down to a per - pixel limiting surface brightness of 29.0 ( 28.5 ) mag arcsec@xmath5  in @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) with a pixel scale of 1.45  pixel@xmath16 . throughout the imaging a myriad of small lsb objects",
    "can be seen ; however , our interest here was to find the most extreme objects with isophotal sizes of r@xmath17 1  and central surface brightnesses @xmath18 .",
    "because objects at such low surface brightness and large angular size typically contain many compact , high surface brightness contaminants ( foreground stars and background galaxies ) , automated detection algorithms are extraordinarily difficult to employ , and often miss true objects while making false detections due to instrumental noise , scattered light , or diffuse galactic cirrus . rather than using automated detection , two of us ( j.c.m . & j.j.f",
    "each made visual searches of the imaging , independently identifying three of these extreme lsbs  two in the virgo cluster core , approximately halfway between m87 and m86 , and a third 2  south of m87 , towards the m49 subcluster .",
    "subsequent inspection of the deep ngvs imaging ( ferrarese et  al .",
    "2012 ) confirms all objects , providing deep @xmath19 data with sub - arcsecond seeing .",
    "figure  [ imaging ] shows the deep burrell schmidt and ngvs imaging of our extreme virgo lsbs .",
    "the right panel shows the location of the objects within virgo , taken from from mihos et  al .  in preparation .",
    "the middle panels show the schmidt imaging both at full resolution , and after masking discrete sources and median filtering in 9x9 pixel ( 13x13 ) scales .",
    "the rightmost panels show expanded views of the ngvs imaging , similarly processed to 1  pixel@xmath16 scales .",
    "the objects are clearly visible in both datasets .",
    "while this paper focuses on the largest lsb objects , many more smaller objects exist throughout virgo ; one example can be seen in the middle panels directly east ( left ) of vlsb - a : a small lsb galaxy originally identified in ngvs imaging ( figure  15 of ferrarese et  al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "to extract surface brightness profiles of these sources , we first use iraf s objmasks task to mask the brightest of the compact sources in and around each object .",
    "the sources are likely background contaminants ; ngvs imaging resolves many of them into background galaxies , and we detect no excess of compact sources over the surrounding field in either vlsb - a or -c ( vlsb - b does appear to have a slight excess , discussed in  3 ) .",
    "we then calculate surface brightness profiles using both the average and median pixel intensities as a function of radius ( figure  [ surfphot ] ) .",
    "using an average includes the light from the fainter unmasked sources , while a median essentially traces the diffuse light alone .",
    "we fit sersic models to the median surface brightness profiles ; the fits are shown in figure  [ surfphot ] , and the derived structural parameters given in table  [ galprops ] .",
    "ellipticity estimates for vlsb - b and -c come from galfit modeling ; vlsb - a is too low in surface brightness to yield a meaningful estimate .",
    "we report average  colors for vlsb - a and -b , but can not measure a color for vlsb - c as it falls outside the @xmath14 imaging footprint of the schmidt survey .",
    "the derived properties given in table  [ galprops ] show that , like the extreme coma lsbs ( vd15a , koda et  al .",
    "2015 ; k15 ) , these objects are reasonably well characterized by exponential profiles ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "they are large ( = 40120 , or 3 - 10 kpc at the virgo distance ) , extremely low in central surface brightness ( @xmath18 ) , and fairly red ( = 0.60.7 ) .",
    "a search for the galaxies in other datasets finds they are undetected both in deep 21-cm alfalfa data ( haynes et  al .",
    "2011 ) and far - uv galex imaging ; coupled with their diffuse nature and lack of strong h@xmath21 emission ( a. watkins , private communication ) , this suggests they are not actively forming stars .    figure  [ scaling ] compares our vlsb objects to other stellar systems , including early type galaxies in the virgo and fornax clusters and the local group , as well as globular clusters ( gcs ) and ucds in virgo ( see ferrarese et  al .",
    "2012 for details of the data compilation ) .",
    "we also include the extreme lsb galaxies in coma from vd15a . in this figure ,",
    "the coma lsbs merge smoothly onto the sequence for high surface brightness galaxies , while the extreme virgo lsbs reported here populate the plot at the low surface brightness end ( see also k15 ) . in this magnitude range ( @xmath22 to @xmath23 ) , early - type cluster galaxies show a continuum in surface brightness , similar to the distribution of surface brightness in the field ( mcgaugh 1996 ) .",
    "the lack of small (  @xmath24 1 kpc ) lsb galaxies in this plot is a selection effect ; in coma , they fall below the spatial resolution of vd15a , while in virgo our selection focused on large galaxies ( @xmath25 1 ) . at @xmath26 ,",
    "smaller objects certainly exist ; they are seen in the k15 coma sample and likely make up a significant fraction of the small lsb objects visible in virgo in the schmidt and ngvs surveys .",
    "it s clear from these studies that lsb galaxies are well - represented in cluster galaxy populations , once selection effects are factored in .",
    "the preceding discussion presumes the vlsb objects are in fact virgo cluster members . to rule out a more local distance , we used ngvs imaging to search for any resolved stellar populations ( likely luminous rgb stars ) .",
    "we use the ngvs master catalog to extract deep @xmath27 and @xmath28 photometry for all sources located within each object s r@xmath29 isophotal radius .",
    "point sources were selected as outlined in durrell et  al .",
    "( 2014 ) : by defining a concentration index @xmath30  = @xmath31 , the difference between the 4-pixel and 8-pixel diameter @xmath28 aperture - corrected magnitudes , and identifying point sources as objects with @xmath32@xmath30  @xmath33 .",
    "only the @xmath28 data was used to define point sources , as the ngvs @xmath28 images were taken under the best seeing conditions .    in figure  [ ngvs ]",
    "we plot @xmath34 color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) for all point sources with @xmath35 within each object .",
    "the faint magnitude cutoff lies @xmath36 mag above the s / n@xmath37 limit for ngvs @xmath28 sources , while the bright limit is avoids saturated objects .",

    "the object appears to be purely diffuse , with no excess of compact sources over background in the system , and shows no obvious sign of tidal stripping .",
    "the three objects presented here are quite diverse in their physical properties . while they are all large and extremely diffuse , and projected deep within virgo , only one ( vlsb - a ) shows obvious signs of the tidal damage expected for diffuse galaxies in a dense environment ; the other two are quite round ( @xmath74 ) with no morphological deformation or extended tidal debris",
    ". meanwhile , globular clusters are only detected within vlsb - b , which suggests a surprisingly high specific frequency ; neither vlsb - a or -c show evidence for globular clusters , yielding upper limits of @xmath75 .5ex@xmath76 for these objects .",
    "the differences between the objects may be due to differences in their evolutionary state or local environment .",
    "the tidal morphology of vlsb - a , along with its kinematic association with m86 , strongly argues that the object is interacting within virgo s m86 subgroup .",
    "however , the lack of obvious tidal distortion in vlsb - b and -c , diffuse galaxies which should be most vulnerable to cluster tides , suggests instead they may lie in the cluster outskirts , or be falling into virgo for the first time .",
    "alternatively , they may be very dark matter dominated , like field lsbs ( e.g. ,  de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ) , and therefore more resistant to tidal stripping . in this context",
    ", it is interesting that vlsb - b shows evidence for globular clusters .",
    "if globular cluster populations trace the dark matter content of a galaxy ( e.g. ,  blakeslee et  al .",
    "1997 ; peng et  al .  2008 ; harris et  al .  2013 ;",
    "hudson et  al .",
    "2014 ) , the high specific frequency we infer for vlsb - b may be a signature of a massive dark halo that protects the system from rapid tidal destruction .",
    "however , a detailed understanding of how these objects fit into the picture of dynamically - driven galaxy evolution in clusters demands a better determination of both their local environment and their intrinsic properties .",
    "while the properties of vlsb - a convincingly place it deep within virgo , the situation for vlsb - b and -c is less clear . without direct distance estimates ( such as from the trgb ) , our results do not unambiguously locate the objects within virgo . while we rule out a local group distance",
    ", they may lie in the field along the line of sight , either in front of or beyond virgo .",
    "however , arguments that these are field objects merely projected onto the virgo cluster also run into problems , since their gas - poor nature and lack of knotty structure makes them very different from known field lsbs ( e.g. ,  de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ) . furthermore ,",
    "if the objects lie beyond virgo , their physical properties would be even more extreme  larger and more luminous ( at fixed low surface brightness ) , potentially rivaling giant lsb galaxies such as malin  1 .",
    "even if located in the intervening field , at distances 2.515 mpc , their large angular sizes and low surface brightnesses show they still inhabit regions of structural parameter space that have been largely unexplored .    nonetheless , the properties of vlsb - a , and the projection of all three galaxies well within virgo s virial radius , argue that they are indeed associated with the virgo itself . the presence of extremely diffuse galaxies in virgo ( this paper ) and coma ( vd15ab , k15 ) shows these objects populate a range of cluster environments . while ultradiffuse coma galaxies have been reported in greater numbers than identified here ,",
    "several factors make direct comparison difficult .",
    "first , our schmidt imaging covers only the inner @xmath77 15% of virgo ; correcting for survey area suggests a total of @xmath77 20 objects throughout the cluster , and even more if they are located preferentially in the cluster outskirts ( as found in coma ; vd15a ) .",
    "second , very few of the reported coma objects approach the low surface brightnesses of our vlsb objects ( see figure  [ scaling ] ) ; such systems may simply be intrinsically rare in _ both _ clusters .",
    "finally , coma is a much richer cluster than virgo , and may house more galaxies of _ all _ types , lsbs included .",
    "however , in comparing lsb populations , cluster richness is a double - edged sword : a richer cluster may also make for a harsher dynamical environment that shortens their lifetime and reduces their overall numbers .",
    "ultimately , these questions will be best addressed through a cluster - wide census of the virgo lsb galaxy population using wide - field surveys such as the ngvs . identifying a larger sample of ultradiffuse galaxies in virgo",
    "would also allow for detailed studies of their resolved stellar populations and physical structure on spatial scales not possible in more distant clusters .",
    "thus a more systematic search for this elusive galaxy population in virgo is well - motivated ."
