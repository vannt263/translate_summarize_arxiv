    "a recent progress in ultra - fast lasers has resulted in the generation of sub-10 fs pulses , which is close to the fundamental limit defined by the light wave period in visible and near - ir @xcite .",
    "today a basic technique for fs - generation is the kerr - lens mode locking ( klm ) @xcite in the combination with a slow saturation of interband or excitonic transitions in semiconductor structure @xcite .",
    "it was shown @xcite , that in both cases a quasi - soliton formation plays a key role in the stabilization of ultra - short pulse generation down to shortest possible pulse durations . moreover ,",
    "the quasi - soliton generation due to its highest stability and simple pulse form is the subject for the use of analytical and semi - analytical approaches , which are of highest theoretical and practical interest that stimulates the investigations in this field .",
    "as was shown in @xcite , the strong nonlinear effects in semiconductor absorbers , such as absorption linewidth enhancement and stark effect , transform the laser dynamics essentially , that causes an additional pulse stabilization and compression .",
    "since the pulse durations in modern ultrafast lasers are comparable or shorter than the absorber dephasing time @xmath1 , the coherent nature of the pulse - semiconductor interaction has to be taken into consideration .",
    "a coherent absorber mode locking has been analyzed in refs .",
    "in particular , it was shown in @xcite that the dynamical gain saturation is essential for the coherent quasi - soliton generation in the lasers . however , the dynamical gain saturation is negligible in femtosecond solid - state lasers , where the dominating nonlinear factors are the self - phase modulation ( spm ) and the self - focusing .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite have demonstrated the generation of fs - pulses of self - induced transparency in solid - state laser with semiconductor quantum - well absorber in the absence of klm .",
    "however , as was shown in @xcite , the self - focusing is essential in femtosecond time domain and should be taken into account in the analysis .",
    "furthermore , an analytical approach to this problem can provide a new insight into the physics of fs - lasers and semiconductor optical devices .",
    "here we present a study of fs - pulse generation in cw solid - state klm - laser with semiconductor absorber .",
    "we developed an analytical model that accounts for a coherent pulse - semiconductor interaction , spm , klm , group - velocity dispersion ( gvd ) and gain saturation by the full pulse energy .",
    "the condition of the _ sech_-shaped pulse formation was found and the contribution of kerr - lensing to pulse characteristics was considered .",
    "we showed that the generation of chirp - free @xmath2- and @xmath0- pulses as well as chirped pulses with the variable area is possible .",
    "the obtained solutions are stable against laser noise and automodulational instability .",
    "based on the slowly varying envelope approximation for the field amplitude @xmath3 , let consider a distributed system including saturable gain , linear loss and spm with coefficients @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , kerr - lens - induced fast saturable absorption with saturation intensity @xmath7 , gvd with coefficient @xmath8 and bandwidth limiting element with transmission bandwidth @xmath9 , where @xmath10 defines the minimal pulse duration and is equal to 2.5 fs for ti : sapphire laser . for the sake of staying in framework of analytical approach we used a two - level model for quantum - well semiconductor absorber .",
    "this assumption is valid for quantum - confined semiconductor structures utilized in mode - locked fs - lasers ( see , for example , @xcite ; last work contains some generalizations of model in framework of numerical analysis ) .",
    "when the pulse duration @xmath11 is much shorter than the dephasing time in absorber @xmath1 and the field intensity @xmath12 is not enough for the stark effect manifestation , the pulse - semiconductor interaction obeys the bloch equations @xcite :",
    "@xmath13    where @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the slowly varying envelopes of the polarization quadrature components and the population difference , respectively , @xmath17 , @xmath18 [ coulomb@xmath19 nm ] is the dipole momentum , @xmath20 is the elementary charge ( in our calculations we used the parameters of gaas / alas absorber , the saturation energy @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) , @xmath23 is the mismatch between optical resonance and pulse carrier frequency , @xmath24 is the instant field phase .",
    "an initial saturable absorption @xmath25 ( @xmath26 is the field frequency ) corresponds to the carriers density @xmath27 and the thickness of semiconductor absorber @xmath28 .",
    "the laser part of the master equation is the generalized landau - ginzburg equation @xcite .",
    "then the master equation can be written as :    @xmath29 a+ &   & \\nonumber \\\\ \\left [ \\frac{2\\pi nz_{a}\\omega d}{c}u-\\frac{2\\pi nz_{a}d}{c}\\frac{dv}{dt}\\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath30 is the longitudinal coordinate normalized to the cavity length , i.e. the number of the cavity round - trip , @xmath31 is the light velocity , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the phase and time field delays of the field after the cavity round - trip , respectively .",
    "we neglected the spatial effects in the absorber .",
    "later we will consider only steady - state pulse - like solutions , which allows to eliminate the dependence on @xmath30 .",
    "let normalize the times to @xmath10 and the field to @xmath34 ( note , however , that we will use a dimensional pulse duration in figs .",
    "[ f2 ] and [ f4 ] )",
    ". then @xmath6 and @xmath35 are normalized to @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the index of refractivity , @xmath38 is the permittivity and @xmath39 @xmath40 ( ti : sapphire laser ) . with these normalizations , @xmath41 corresponds to the saturation parameter of kerr - lens induced fast saturable absorber of @xmath42 and @xmath43 spot size in active medium .",
    "dimensionless spm parameter @xmath6 is equal to @xmath44 for @xmath45 ti : sapphire crystal .",
    "additionally , we introduce an important control parameter @xmath46 , which is governed by 1 ) the ratio between the size of generation mode in active medium and in semiconductor absorber or by 2 ) the reflectivity of the upper surface of the semiconductor saturable device .",
    "formally , the variation of @xmath46 means the variation of relative contribution of spm , kerr - lens - induced saturable absorption and saturable gain with respect to the saturable absorption in semiconductor .    as we will see",
    "later , the gain saturation by the full pulse energy is an important factor for the pulse stability and thus should be taken into account .",
    "the simplest way to do this is to use a quasi - two level model for active medium .",
    "after some calculations for the gain saturated by the full pulse energy @xmath47 in the steady - state condition we have @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the gain for the full population inversion , @xmath50 is the gain relaxation time normalized to the cavity period @xmath51 , @xmath52 is the dimensionless pump intensity , @xmath53 is the pump frequency , @xmath54 is the absorption cross section of active medium , @xmath55 is the pump intensity , @xmath56 is the normalized inverse energy of the gain saturation .",
    "later we will consider the different realizations of our model aimed to investigation of the soliton - like solution of the system ( [ e1 ] , [ e2 ] ) .",
    "in the beginning we consider the case of chirp - free pulse - like solutions .",
    "after integration of the equations ( [ e1 ] ) , the master equation ( [ e2 ] ) reads as :    @xmath57 a- &   & \\nonumber",
    "\\\\ \\frac{\\gamma _ { a}}{t_{coh}}\\sin ( \\psi ( z , t)),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath58 @xmath59 is the pulse area ( note , that the field and time are the dimensionless quantities here ) . under steady - state condition ( the pulse envelope is independent on _ z _ ) , an integro - differential eq . ( [ e3 ] ) results in differential equation    @xmath60 \\psi ( t)- &   & \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\frac{\\gamma _ { a}}{t_{coh}}\\sin ( \\psi ( t))=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the absence of the lasing factors such as linear loss , frequency filtering , spm and gvd we have a well - known nonlinear equation with @xmath2-soliton solution in the form @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the amplitude , @xmath11 is the duration @xcite .",
    "but this solution does not satisfy the full eq .",
    "( [ e4 ] ) in the absence of klm ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "now let consider the eq .",
    "( [ e4 ] ) without klm , spm and gvd ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the substitution @xmath65 , @xmath66 ( `` area - amplitude '' representation ) reduces the third - order eq .",
    "( [ e4 ] ) to the second - order one :    @xmath67 y-\\frac{\\gamma _ { a}}{t_{coh}}\\sin ( x)=0.\\ ] ]    we solved this equation numerically and found a non-_sech_-shaped @xmath2-solutions for it ( see fig . [ f1 ] , where numerical solution is shown in comparison with the _ sech_-shaped pulse ) .",
    "this clearly indicates on some additional nonlinear factors which are necessary for the _",
    "sech_-pulse formation and which are lacking in eq .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) .",
    "however , @xmath2- non-_sech _ solution needs a more detailed investigation because of it may be relevant mechanism for extremely short pulse generation in real lasers . as is known @xcite , the main mechanism of destabilization of fs - pulses is the noise generation as result of loss saturation in absorber . in the case of @xmath2-pulse formation",
    ", a rabi flopping of the absorber population suppresses the noise behind the pulse tail , that stabilizes fs - generation @xcite .    to investigate the pulse - like solutions of eq .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) analytically , we used a harmonic approximation : @xmath68 , which is usual for analysis of oscillating processes ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "i our case this approximation is most appropriate for `` area - amplitude '' representation because of that allows to describe the full pulse area but not only behavior of the field amplitude in the vicinity of pulse maximum as in the case of polynomial expansion .",
    "we select the subharmonic corresponding to @xmath2-pulse generation ( first term ) and `` high frequency '' corrections to it . retaining only the first term , in the `` area - amplitude '' representation",
    ", we arrive to the solution @xmath69 @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , which corresponds to _ sech_-shaped solution in the `` time - amplitude '' representation .",
    "the relations between pulse parameters are analogues to that ones for @xmath2-_sech_-shaped solution , but an additional relation between pulse amplitude and dissipative coefficients @xmath4 and @xmath5 appears .",
    "[ f2 ] ( curves 1 and 2 ) presents the pulse durations for two physical approximated solutions of eq .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) .",
    "one can see , that the coherent absorber provides sub-10 fs pulse generation starting from some minimal pump .",
    "an important feature of the obtained solution is the positive difference between saturated gain and linear loss coefficients @xmath73 , which imposes an important requirement on the possible minimal saturable loss coefficient @xmath74 , which is necessary for stable pulse generation .",
    "so , there is the minimal modulation depth of absorber that confines the region of the pulse stability against laser noise .",
    "as it was shown in @xcite , the pulse is stable if the net - gain outside pulse is negative that results in the condition @xmath75 , i.e. @xmath76 . the dependence of the minimal modulation depth on the pump is shown in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] for two depicted in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] solutions of eq .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) ( lower curve corresponds to the solution with larger duration , the dashed curve depicts the generation threshold , hatching shows a corresponding stability zone ) .",
    "as one can see , the pulse stabilization against laser noise is possible only for the solution with longer duration .",
    "the stability range widens in @xmath74 , however at the cost of pump growth . it should be noted , that in the absence of a coherent mechanism the pulse stabilization can be caused only by essential contribution of dynamical gain saturation @xcite , that is not possible in fs - time domain , or by `` soliton mode locking '' @xcite due to spm and gvd balance .",
    "self - induced transparency in semiconductor absorber produces a quite different mechanism of pulse stabilization , which does not involve any additional nonlinear processes .",
    "now let introduce into equations the spm and gvd terms , that corresponds to the real - world femtosecond lasers . assuming a chirp - free ( i.e. pure real ) nature of possible solution we can reduce eq .",
    "( [ e4 ] ) to the first - order equation :    @xmath77 y(x)-\\frac{\\gamma _ { a}}{t_{coh}}\\sin x=0.\\ ] ]    with the above described harmonic approximation we have the following solutions : @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath72 for @xmath2-pulse .",
    "the pulse durations are presented in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] by curves 1 and 2. the stable solution has a slightly longer duration than the unstable one .",
    "formally , the obtained solution is the solution of the laser part of master equation that in the same time satisfies the bloch equations .",
    "the stability of the solution results from the self - induced transparency in absorber , when the pulse propagates in the condition of the positive net - gain but noise is suppressed due to rabi flopping of the absorber population .",
    "we do not analyze the automodulational stability @xcite of the solution since it has been demonstrated directly by the numerical simulation in @xcite .",
    "thus we can conclude , that there is not the generation of coherent _ sech_-shaped pulse in the absence of kerr - lens - induced fast saturable absorption .",
    "but the generation of non-_sech _ @xmath2-pulse takes place , which imposes a limitation on minimal modulation depth of the absorber with subsequent growth of generation threshold .",
    "nevertheless , as result of the coherent @xmath2-pulse formation , the pulse stabilization in this case is possible without contribution of dynamical gain saturation , or spm and gvd . in the next section",
    "we take into account the contribution of klm .",
    "the presence of klm is described by the term @xmath82 in eq .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) . in this case",
    "there is an exact @xmath2-_sech_-pulse solution of eq .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) , however for a strict relation between @xmath35 and @xmath46 , so that @xmath83 .",
    "the _ sech_-shaped solution has the following parameters :    @xmath84    there are two distinct features of @xmath2-_sech_-pulse generation : 1 ) the condition @xmath85 is satisfied automatically and , consequently , there is no limitation on the minimal modulation depth of the absorber ; 2 ) the expression for the pulse duration is precisely same as for the case of pure fast saturable absorber mode locking @xcite , that suggests that the klm is the main mechanism determining the pulse duration .",
    "this conclusion corroborates with the results of ref .",
    "the action of the coherent absorber determines the pulse delay @xmath33 and imposes a restriction on the pulse area , i. e. the relation between pulse duration and amplitude .",
    "pulse duration in the presence of klm is shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] by dotted curve 3 .",
    "as is seen , the pulse duration is much shorter than for the case with no klm , especially for the small pump . as the contribution of semiconductor absorber",
    "is increased ( @xmath46 approaches 1 , curve 1 in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] ) the pulse duration is reduced down to the limit of the validity of the slowly varying envelope approximation .",
    "an explanation of the additional relation between the parameters of kerr - lens - induced saturable absorber and semiconductor absorber is as follows : a _ sech_-shaped solution satisfies both pure laser equation and the bloch equations , but the coherent interaction discriminates the special cases of @xmath86-area pulses , in particular @xmath2-pulses , which are provided by @xmath87 relation .",
    "let us study an automodulational stability of the coherent laser pulse , which we showed before to be very important factor in fs - lasers @xcite .",
    "we used an aberrationless approximation , which assumes an approximately unchanged form of solution and @xmath30-dependence for the pulse parameters .",
    "the substitution of the pulse envelope in eq .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) with following expansion into the time series yields :    @xmath88    eqs .",
    "( [ e8 ] ) were derived for a chirp - free solution with the dispersion @xmath89 exactly compensating spm . to be self - consistent the system ( [ e8 ] )",
    "should be completed by the additional relation between pulse duration and amplitude arising from the bloch equations . after some calculations we have the explicit expressions , which determine the pulse stability .",
    "the pulse is stable if the jacobian of the right - hand sides of first two eqs .",
    "( [ e8 ] ) has only non - positive real parts of eigenvalues .",
    "the condition for amplitude perturbation decay @xmath90 is satisfied automatically .",
    "for @xmath87 the pulse possesses a marginal stability with respect to the evolution of pulse duration .",
    "however for any @xmath91 the pulse stability condition with respect to duration evolution is satisfied .",
    "thus , we have analyzed the characteristics of @xmath2-_sech_-pulses generated in klm - laser with semiconductor coherent absorber .",
    "the main features here are : the `` automatic '' stabilization against laser noise and against pulse automodulations , and , also , the pulse duration decrease down to sub-10 fs .",
    "however , equations describing this physical situation allow yet another type of analytical solutions .",
    "as one can see from the previous part of our work , the ultrashort pulse is the soliton - like solution for the both laser part of the master equation and the bloch equations .",
    "now we will consider the complex anzatz @xmath93 describing a pulse with chirp @xmath94 .",
    "it is known @xcite , that the eqs .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) have a _ sech_-shaped solutions in form of chirp - free @xmath0-pulse or _",
    "sech_-shaped chirped solution , when the following relations hold :    @xmath95    where    @xmath96    a chirp - free solution is a @xmath0-pulse , which is obviously unstable in the absorber since the full population inversion behind the pulse tail amplifies the noise",
    ". however , another nonlinear factors in klm - laser can stabilize the pulse and this requires a corresponding consideration .",
    "parameters of the chirp - free @xmath0-pulse in klm - laser are :    @xmath97    this result is very similar to @xmath2-solution ( [ e7 ] ) , however there is some difference : as the amplitude of the @xmath0-pulse is two times smaller than the amplitude of @xmath2-pulse , the klm - parameter should be increased four times and the dispersion should be decreased accordingly in order to produce the same effect and support coherent pulse generation .",
    "curve 4 in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] depicts the duration of @xmath0-pulse .",
    "as is seen , the pulse duration slightly differs from the duration of @xmath2-pulse ( curve 2 ) and is shorter in the region of small @xmath46 ( curve 2 in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] ) .",
    "as was said before , the @xmath0-pulse inverts the population difference in the absorber that causes the noise amplification behind the pulse tail .",
    "hence , the laser pulse stabilization is possible if the condition @xmath98 is satisfied .",
    "this defines the maximal initial loss in the absorber ( dotted curve in fig .",
    "it is seen , that the maximal modulation depth exceeds the threshold ( dashed curve ) and , consequently , the generation of the stable @xmath0-pulse is possible .    when the condition @xmath99 holds there are the chirped pulses with _ sech_-shape .",
    "in this case , the expressions for @xmath8 and pulse parameters are bulky and we do not write them here @xcite . the pulse duration is presented in fig . [ f2 ] by curve 5 . as is seen , the duration of chirped pulse can be very short even for the moderate value of @xmath100 .",
    "there is a minimum in the dependence of the pulse duration on @xmath46 ( an optimal reflectivity of semiconductor absorber device , curve 3 in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] ) and it does not coincide with the point of precise chirp compensation ( curve 1 in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] , a ) . additionally , the pulse area is variable for this type of solution ( curve 1 in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] , b ) .",
    "there is a sharp minimum in the dependence of the pulse duration on @xmath35 ( curve 4 in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] ) . in our case",
    "a corresponding klm - parameter is @xmath101 .",
    "as it was in the previous case , the minimum of the pulse duration does not coincide with the point of chirp compensation ( curve 2 in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] , a ) .",
    "unlike the case of variation of @xmath46 , the change of @xmath35 causes only a slight variation of the pulse area ( curve 2 in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] , b ) .    summarizing , the generation of _",
    "sech_-shaped @xmath0-pulses and chirped pulses with variable area is possible in klm - laser with coherent semiconductor absorber as a result of definite relation between klm s and saturable absorber s contribution .",
    "a larger klm contribution ( for a fixed @xmath46 ) is needed to produce the pulse in the comparison with the case of @xmath2-pulse generation .",
    "our results suggest that the pulse duration is determined rather by klm , whereas a saturable absorber puts a limitation on the pulse area and stabilizes the pulse against automodulations . but another important feature of klm in the presence of semiconductor absorber is the self - starting ability . to estimate it in our model",
    "we analyzed an evolution of the initial noise spike , which is much longer than the relaxation time of the excitation in absorber @xmath102 .",
    "for such noise spike an absorber is fast and the action of spm and self - focusing is negligible . using the normalization of the time ,",
    "gain saturation energy and field intensity to @xmath51 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively , an evolution equation for the pulse seed is :    @xmath105    where all notations have the meaning as before , and the field parameters refer to the noise spike . to solve eq .",
    "( [ e10 ] ) we used , as before , an aberrationless approximation .",
    "the decay of the field ( growth of the pulse duration and decrease of its intensity ) means in our model that the system will not self - start .",
    "an opposite situation with an asymptotic growth of the pulse seed testifies about ability of the system to self - start .",
    "[ f6 ] demonstrates the regions of the initial pulse parameters corresponding to the self - starting .",
    "the dark zone corresponds to the pump @xmath106 , which is close to the threshold of mode locking self - starting .",
    "lower pump can not provide the self - starting while a higher pump ( @xmath107 ) causes an expansion of self - starting region .",
    "in conclusion , we investigated analytically the conditions of the coherent pulse formation in cw solid - state laser with the semiconductor absorber .",
    "it was found , that the mode locking in the absence of kerr - lens - induced fast saturable absorption does not produce _",
    ". however , there exists @xmath2-pulse ( pulse of self - induced transparency ) , which has fs - duration and is stabilized by the defined minimal modulation depth of absorber . the stabilization results from the coherent interaction with absorber in the condition of the positive difference between saturated gain and linear loss coefficients . but positive value of this difference increases the threshold of sub-10 fs pulse generation due to growth of the modulation depth of absorber , that is required by stability condition . a combined action of klm and coherent absorption produces the _ sech_-shaped pulse . in this case",
    "there is no a requirement to the minimal modulation depth of semiconductor absorber .",
    "the pulse duration , which is close to the fundamental limit , is defined by klm and the coherent absorber defines the pulse area , stabilizes the pulse against the automodulations and self - starts the mode locking operation . as result , there are the generation of @xmath2- , @xmath0-pulses and chirped pulses with variable area",
