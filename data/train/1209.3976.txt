    "the investigation of the properties of bound state of gluons , the so - called glueballs , represents an important step toward the understanding of the nonperturbative aspects of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "the search for glueballs is also relevant in the framework of hadron phenomenology , as they might explain the nature of some enigmatic mesonic resonances ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) .",
    "lattice qcd is a well - established non - perturbative approach to solve qcd : within this context the glueball spectrum has been obtained @xcite , where the lightest glueball has @xmath0 quantum numbers and a mass of about 1.6 gev .",
    "this energy region has been studied in a variety of effective approaches , e.g. refs .",
    "the second lightest glueball has been predicted to be a tensor ( @xmath1 ) , see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a related phenomenological discussion .",
    "the third lightest state is a pseudoscalar glueball ( @xmath2 ) with a mass of about 2.6 gev .",
    "this value represents the starting point of our investigation of the properties of the pseudoscalar glueball @xcite ( for scenarios with a lower mass see ref .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) .",
    "namely , we study the interactions of the pseudoscalar glueball , denoted as @xmath3 , to scalar and pseudoscalar mesons : we discuss the symmetry properties of the effective lagrangian introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and we present the results for the branching ratios for the two - body decays ( one scalar and one pseudoscalar state ) and for the three - body decays ( three pseudoscalar states ) .",
    "then , we comment on a particular interference problem , only mentioned in  ref .",
    "@xcite , which emerges from the subsequent decay of a scalar meson of the two - body decay into two pseudoscalar states : both decay mechanism end up in the same final states and therefore care is needed .",
    "next , we describe ( to our knowledge for the first time ) the interaction of @xmath3 with baryons : we introduce the chiral effective lagrangian which couples @xmath3 to the nucleon field and its chiral partner .",
    "this lagrangian describes also the proton - antiproton conversion process @xmath4 , which can take place in the planned panda experiment at the upcoming fair facility in darmstadt @xcite , in which the ( center of mass ) energy range above 2.5 gev will be investigated .",
    "the effective lagrangian which couples the pseudoscalar glueball field , @xmath3 with quantum numbers @xmath2 to scalar and pseudoscalar mesons read @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the ( unknown ) coupling constant .",

    "it follows that the lagrangian ( [ intlag ] ) is invariant under @xmath13 transformations , but is not invariant under the axial @xmath14 transformation , because : @xmath15    we now turn to discrete symmetries .",
    "the parity transformation @xmath16 of the multiplet @xmath7 reads @xmath17 and that of the glueball reads @xmath18 it is then easy to verify that the lagrangian ( [ intlag ] ) is parity invariant . under charge conjugation @xmath19 the transformations @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    "hold , in virtue of which the lagrangian ( [ intlag ] ) is also left invariant .",
    "the assignment of the quark - antiquark fields in our work is as follows : ( i ) in the pseudoscalar sector the fields @xmath22 and @xmath23 represent the pions or the kaons , respectively .",
    "the bare fields @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the non - strange and strange mixing contributions of the physical states @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "( ii ) in the scalar sector we assign the field @xmath28 to the physical isotriplet state @xmath29 and the scalar kaon fields @xmath30 to the resonance @xmath31 the fields @xmath32 and @xmath33 correspond to the physical resonances @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the small mixing of the bare fields @xmath36 and @xmath37 is neglected here @xcite .    to evaluate the decays of the pseudoscalar glueball @xmath3 we have to take into account that the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry takes place , which implies the shift of the scalar - isoscalar fields as @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 represent the chiral non - strange and strange condensates .",
    "in addition , due to the fact that also ( axial-)vector mesons are present in the full lagrangian @xcite , one has also to ` shift ' the axial - vector fields and to redefine the renormalization constant of the pseudoscalar fields , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , where the quantities @xmath45 are the wave function renormalization constants . the theoretical results for the two - body and three - body branching ratios of the pseudoscalar glueball @xmath3 as evaluated from eq .",
    "( [ intlag ] ) are summarized in table i.a and i.b for the mass @xmath46 gev , see also ref .",

    "there are then two possible decay amplitudes for the process @xmath79 : one is the direct decay mechanism reported in table i.a , the other is the decay chain @xmath80 .",
    "the immediate question is , if interference effects emerge which spoil the results presented in table i.a and i.b .",

    "( [ intbar ] ) , and the corresponding results for the mesonic decays presented in ref .",
