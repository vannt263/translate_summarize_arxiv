    "the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model provides a successful framework for understanding the formation and evolution of structure in our universe . according to this model",
    ", gravity amplifies primordial density fluctuations , and structure forms by hierarchical clustering : small objects form first , later merging to form larger objects . the most promising candidate for cdm",
    "is the weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) . in this picture , the microscopic interaction between cdm particles is negligible ( collisionless ) , and they interact only by gravity .",
    "however , this assumption has not been fully verified and it is fair to say that the microscopic nature of cdm is still unknown .",
    "it is important , therefore , to explore the consequences of varying this underlying assumption about cdm in the hope that astronomical observations can be used to place meaningful constraints .",
    "the possible variation of the microscopic nature of cold dark matter is closely linked to the problems of the cdm model . despite its success ,",
    "the cdm model has several problems which exist mostly in the small scale regime ( see , for example , @xcite ) . among these problems",
    ", much attention has been focused on the n - body simulation results for the inner density slope , since the observed rotation curves of dark - matter dominated dwarf and low surface brightness ( lsb ) disk galaxies tend to favour mass profiles with a flat - density core unlike the singular profiles of the cdm n - body simulations ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the latter are generally characterized by an empirical fitting formula for the spherically averaged density profiles in those n - body results , either the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile ( @xcite ) , for which @xmath13 as @xmath14 , or the moore profile ( @xcite ) , for which @xmath15 insteadcdm simulations , @xmath16 , decreases monotonically towards the centre .",
    "this change of slope , however , does not seem to fully account for the observed rotation curves .",
    "@xcite conclude , by surveying several simulation results by different groups , that neither the typical nfw profile nor the moore profile provides a good fit , but one needs a little more complex form such as the one by @xcite . ] .",
    "it was controversial whether the observed data was resolved well enough to indicate a soft core ( e.g. see @xcite for possible beam smearing effect on the data ) , but observations have built up which favour the soft core even after eliminating the beam smearing effect ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "after much more work on the n - body simulations of cdm , the discrepancy between these data and the numerical halo profiles remains significant ( see , for instance , @xcite )    this apparent discrepancy between the n - body simulation results and observations of dwarf galaxy rotation curves has raised a question about the nature of dark matter , including the assumption that cdm is collisionless .",
    "people have suggested solutions to this discrepancy which either preserves the collisionless nature of the dark matter or else adopts a new picture . in the former category are explanations which attribute the discrepancy to astrophysical processes beyond the pure n - body dynamics ( e.g. @xcite ) or to a primordial power spectrum tilted away from the harrison - zeldovich shape ( e.g. @xcite ) . in the latter category ,",
    "the proposal of self - interacting dark matter ( sidm ) by @xcite has received a lot of attention . in this picture ,",
    "microscopic interaction between dark matter particles is non - negligible and can affect the dynamics of halo formation .",
    "since the actual identity and microscopic nature of cdm is still unknown , it is important to explore the consequences of such hypotheses in the hope that astronomical observations can be used to place meaningful constraints .    the truncated isothermal sphere ( tis ) halo model developed by ( * ?",
    "* also see @xcite ) provides a simple physical clue about the existence of such soft cores in haloes of cosmological origin which otherwise closely resemble the cdm haloes found by n - body simulation in all respects except the presence of the inner cusp .",
    "the model is based upon the assumption that haloes form from the collapse and virialization of `` top - hat '' density perturbations and are spherical , isotropic , and isothermal .",
    "this leads to a unique , nonsingular tis , a minimum - energy solution of the lane - emden equation .",
    "the resulting density profile is nearly indistinguishable from that deduced from the observed rotation curves of dwarf and lsb disk galaxies , as fit by @xcite with a profile involving a soft core ( @xcite ) .",
    "the assumption of isothermality which underlies the tis halo model is the primary reason that the central cusp of the cdm n - body haloes is replaced by a soft core .",
    "the n - body haloes are also approximately isothermal , but there is typically a small temperature dip near the centre .",
    "this suggests that if some mechanism existed to transport heat inward so as to make cdm haloes more isothermal , they might exhibit soft cores while maintaining the same basic halo structure at larger radii already found for cdm haloes .",
    "the collisionality of sidm serves as such a mechanism : elastic collisions transport heat inward , which flattens the central cusp of the cdm density profile to produce a constant - density core .",
    "the problem of sidm halo formation has so far been studied primarily by numerical n - body experiments .",
    "some of the first attempts to calculate the effect of the elastic scattering of sidm on halo structure formation involved _ isolated _ haloes which were assumed initially to follow the equilibrium profiles ( e.g. nfw profile ) found in collisionless n - body simulations of standard cdm ( @xcite ; @xcite ; both start from the hernquist profile ( @xcite ) which is a good approximation to the nfw profile ) .",
    "@xcite , for instance , found that sidm haloes can form flat density cores within a relaxation time as expected , but also that the lifetime of such flat cores is only a few relaxation times .",
    "they concluded , therefore , that most galactic haloes would have undergone core collapse .",
    "the effect of sidm collisionality on halo structure has also been studied by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bsi  hereafter ) by solving 1d , quasi - static fluid equations .",
    "these authors also considered _ isolated _ haloes like those in the n - body experiments mentioned above , adopting 1d , spherical symmetry , with non - cosmological boundary conditions .",
    "they treated the dynamics of sidm by a fluid approximation developed previously in the study of stellar dynamics , derived from the boltzmann equation , in which they modified the heat conduction term to handle the elastic scattering of the sidm particle - particle interaction .",
    "they solved the spherically - symmetric , virialized `` gravothermal fluid '' equations of @xcite , which include mass conservation , hydrostatic equilibrium , an equation for heat conduction , and the first law of thermodynamics . according to these equations , the halo is time - dependent because heat conduction causes it to evolve through a continuous sequence of hydrostatic equilibria .",
    "an analytical self - similar solution to these equations was found in the limit of large scattering mean free path  the limit where the mean free path is much larger than the size of the halo  following the derivation of @xcite for globular clusters .",
    "the bsi solution shows that secular evolution always takes a configuration in the long mean free path limit and drives it into the short mean free path regime . in order to track the evolution into the short mean free path regime , as well ,",
    "bsi then used their similarity solution as the initial condition for a numerical solution of the same gravothermal fluid equations , but for finite scattering cross - section .",
    "this approach made it possible to follow core collapse to a much more advanced stage than the n - body experiments could . from this",
    ", they concluded that the ultimate core collapse time was much larger than the relaxation time in the core , long enough even to exceed a hubble time in some cases .",
    "their estimated core collapse time is @xmath17 , which contradicts the result found by @xcite and @xcite that the core collapse time was only a few relaxation times .",
    "this apparent discrepancy in core collapse timescale between the study by bsi and the numerical n - body experiments ( @xcite ; @xcite ) may be attributed to the fact that their adopted initial conditions were different . in bsi , as mentioned , the initial condition was tuned to be in the extremely long mean free path limit , @xmath18 , where @xmath4 is the mean free path and @xmath19 is the gravitational scale height or roughly the halo size .",
    "this occurs when the system is either dilute enough or the scattering cross section ( per unit mass ) @xmath1 is small enough , since @xmath20 . according to bsi",
    ", most of the collapse time is spent to reach the condition @xmath21 , and the halo density profile always has a flat core . by contrast",
    ", @xcite started with a cuspy profile with parameters which corresponded to a condition @xmath22 . in this case",
    ", sidm halo cores can quickly reach @xmath23 or they are already in the short mean free path limit , which then requires only a few relaxation times for core collapse .    in what follows",
    ", we will cover the whole range of @xmath1 and show that the observed dwarf - galaxy rotation curves are best - fit when the sidm interaction has its maximal effect , which occurs when @xmath23 , so the regime of greatest interest may be that of @xcite .",
    "if so , then most isolated haloes would , indeed , suffer core collapse within a hubble time .",
    "however , the shared limitation of the analyses of bsi , @xcite and @xcite , that of non - cosmological boundary conditions , is a severe one .",
    "cosmological infall may inhibit core collapse .",
    "if cosmological infall can delay core collapse substantially , previous estimates based on isolated halo models would change by shifting the time of the onset of core collapse until cosmological infall becomes negligible .",
    "the effect of cosmological boundary conditions on sidm halo formation has been studied numerically by cosmological n - body simulations , in which gaussian random noise initial conditions for cdm were incorporated .",
    "early work along these lines attempted to derive the maximal effect of collisionality by adopting the fully collisional limit which corresponds to ordinary gas dynamics ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the surprising result they reported was that simulations yielded density profiles with central cusps even steeper  with logarithmic slope close to @xmath24  than those in collisionless n - body simulations .",
    "subsequent cosmological n - body experiments which treated the sidm elastic scattering in more detail , however , reported that halo density profiles were flatter than those of either fully collisional or purely collisionless simulations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "they found that values of @xmath1 in the range @xmath25 \\,{\\rm cm}^{2 } { \\rm g}^{-1 } $ ] ( the range of preferred @xmath1 varies among these works , but within less than an order of magnitude ) produced sidm haloes with sufficient profile flattening to account for dwarf galaxy rotation curves , which did not suffer from the rapid core collapse identified in the earlier n - body experiments for isolated haloes .",
    "@xcite speculated that this might be the result of cosmological infall , which was absent from the calculations of isolated haloes .",
    "in addition , @xcite found that sidm collisions in cluster - sized haloes would be more frequent than in dwarf - sized haloes , thus producing relatively larger cores in clusters , while observations tend to show that dwarfs and lsbs show relatively larger cores than clusters .",
    "this led them to suggest that the scattering cross section be velocity - dependent ( @xmath26 ) so that more massive haloes would have a smaller degree of density profile flattening .",
    "later , @xcite tested this hypothesis and confirmed that it could match observed core sizes from dwarfs to galaxy clusters .    further study of the formation and evolution of sidm haloes is warranted to resolve the issues raised by previous work and put the subject on a firmer theoretical footing .",
    "on the one hand , the numerical n - body simulations and 1d semi - analytical treatment mentioned above of isolated haloes with non - cosmological boundary conditions are unable to address the important effects of cosmological infall . on the other hand , the fully cosmological n - body simulations which have been performed of haloes that arise during large - scale structure formation in the sidm model",
    "have so far been limited by numerical resolution and dynamic range . as a result ,",
    "simulation results published to date do not attempt a detailed enough comparison with observed galactic rotation curves to determine if sidm haloes can really match them or to give a very reliable constraint on the sidm cross section .",
    "such simulations do not afford enough insight into the underlying dynamical processes which govern the halo structure , either .",
    "finally , the wide range of typical collapse epochs expected in a cdm universe for the wide range of halo masses extending from dwarf galaxies to clusters suggests that the effect of the sidm interaction may be halo - mass - dependent ; this dependence has not yet been adequately explored .    towards this end , we have derived a fully cosmological model for the origin and evolution of cdm haloes in the presence of nongravitational collisionality ( i.e. elastic scattering ) .",
    "we have combined the fluid approximation of bsi with the spherical infall model for cosmological perturbation growth to yield fully time - dependent , detailed similarity solutions for sidm haloes , for arbitrary degree of collisionality .",
    "we shall apply these solutions to test the hypothesis that cosmological infall retards the core collapse of sidm haloes , and compare the predicted sidm halo profiles with the mass profiles inferred from dwarf galaxy rotation curves .",
    "this will enable us to place much better quantitative constraints on the sidm cross section and better assess the validity of the sidm model .",
    "subsequent to the original suggestion by @xcite and the exploration described above of the halo structure which results , related work has focused on constraining the sidm hypothesis by its implications for other astrophysical phenomena or attributing density flattening to more complicated cdm dynamics or gas dynamical feedback effects within the standard cdm picture .",
    "there seem to be strong observational constraints on the possible range of @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite ruled out a range of @xmath27 , @xmath28\\,{\\rm cm}^{2 } { \\rm g}^{-1 } $ ] , based on their calculation of the evaporation time of the dark matter haloes of elliptical galaxies in the clusters .",
    "@xcite rule out all values of @xmath29 by comparing the predicted truncation radii of sidm haloes inside clusters by ram - pressure stripping to those of observed haloes which they obtain using cluster gravitational lensing observations .",
    "@xcite conclude that if @xmath30,the supermassive black holes in the centres of galactic haloes would be more massive than observed . along the line of explaining flattened cores within the standard cdm picture ( see @xcite for recent review ) , @xcite , as in @xcite",
    ", investigate the effect of dynamical friction by clumpy substructure associated with baryonic dissipation and show that a flat core can be generated .",
    "@xcite and @xcite claim that soft cores can be induced by the presence of a cdm bar structure .",
    "@xcite argue that the gas rotation speed in a galactic disk may be different from the dark matter circular velocity , which would , therefore , be wrongfully interpreted as implying the existence of soft cores .",
    "dynamical feedback effects from supernova explosions is another possibility ( @xcite ) .",
    "observationally , related to the missing satellite problem , the gravitational lensing flux anomaly seems to require clumpy , dark substructures ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , even though no firm conclusion has been established yet .    nevertheless , we believe that sidm is still a viable candidate for dark matter . as we shall discuss below in ",
    "[ discussion_sect ] , the previous analyses restricting @xmath1 are subject to significant caveats .",
    "it is meaningful to study this subject because it can shed light on the nature of dark matter whose origin we do not know yet , and simply because cdm problems are far from reaching a firm conclusion . also , the research effort on sidm has not yet reached the level of that on collisionless cdm .",
    "we have previously reported the results of this paper in a summarized form elsewhere .",
    "@xcite briefly described the result from ",
    "[ nbody_sidm_sect ] .",
    "@xcite summarized the results in light of the current status of cdm research .",
    "however , we warn the reader that these works should be considered as guidelines to the detailed , complete picture of this paper .    the plan of this paper is as follows . in  [ ssgc_sect ] , we review the previous work on self - similar gravitational collapse in the spherical infall model . in  [ fluidapprox_sect ] , we show how the fluid approximation derived from the boltzmann equation can be generalized to include a conduction term which accounts for nongravitational collisionality in an otherwise collisionless dark matter gas .",
    "the assumptions which underlie this fluid approximation will be justified by comparison with the results of cosmological n - body simulations of cdm haloes and with detailed similarity solutions for halo formation by gravitational collapse of collisionless dark matter . in  [ ss_sidm_sect ] , we show that gravitational collapse by spherical infall can be self - similar even in the presence of collisionality , and that the specific condition required for self - similarity is relevant to galactic haloes .",
    "we then describe the basic equations for the dynamics of sidm haloes . in  [ result_sect ] , we present the similarity solution and its application to test the sidm hypothesis , including a comparison with previous n - body results and observed galactic rotation curves .",
    "our conclusions and discussion are in  [ discussion_sect ] .",
    "analytical approximations have been developed to model the formation of haloes by the 1d growth of spherical cosmological density perturbations , in either a collisionless gas or a fluid .",
    "we shall need to refer to some of these solutions to justify our fluid approximation in  [ fluidapprox_sect ] .",
    "we shall also build upon these earlier solutions in deriving new ones which add the effects of collisionality in  [ fluidapprox_sidm_sect ] and [ ss_sidm_sect ] .",
    "it is necessary for us to begin , therefore , by briefly recounting this earlier work .",
    "@xcite first presented the concept of the so called `` secondary infall model ( sim ) '' .",
    "this sim refers to the effect of the addition of a point mass to a uniform , expanding friedmann - robertson - walker universe as a perturbation which causes the surrounding spherical shells to decelerate relative to the background universe , until they reach a radius of maximum expansion and re - collapse .",
    "subsequent work generalized this approach to include spherically - symmetric initial perturbations for which the overdensity profile depends upon radius or mass as a scale - free power - law . along these lines , (",
    "* fg hereafter ) studied the dynamics of collisionless cdm haloes using a self - similar model , adopting a scale - free initial overdensity parametrized by its shape : @xmath31 in equation ( [ overmass ] ) .",

    "* hs hereafter ) showed that a power - law power spectrum would indeed generate a scale - free initial condition , such as was adopted by fg .",
    "they then argued that the resulting nonlinear structure would be described by a power - law profile determined by the shape of the power spectrum .",
    "previously mentioned works adopted a rather unrealistic condition for the collisionless case , that of purely radial motion .",
    "n - body simulations of cdm halo formation find that the virialized region tends toward isotropic random velocities .",
    "some attempts to incorporate tangential velocities within the framework of spherical symmetry have also been made by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "along these lines , one may also refer to work by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein .",
    "the fluid approximation of collisionless cdm halo formation has emerged recently .",
    "@xcite showed that one could use fluid - like conservation equations to mimic the radial - only sims such as the fg model .",
    "@xcite extended this analysis to include tangential motion . in these pictures",
    ", one could expect , for instance , accretion shock structure . @xcite and @xcite therefore used a `` shock jump condition '' which one would only expect from a purely collisional fluid .",
    "the fluid approximation has been used in the literature of stellar dynamics , but its application to cdm halo dynamics is rather new , and as will be described in ",
    "[ fluidapprox_sect ] , it simplifies the description of dark matter dynamics substantially .",
    "self - similar spherical infall models have also been used to study the effect of incorporating additional baryonic physics .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have studied the effect of gas cooling on galaxy formation using self - similar models . because the system was tuned to maintain self - similarity in the presence of cooling , the cooling function used is not perfectly physical . nevertheless , as shown by @xcite",
    ", one can use these models at least to test hydrodynamic codes in the presence of cooling . moreover",
    ", these models capture the generic behaviour of galactic dynamics in the presence of realistic cooling .",
    "the similarity model we shall develop in this paper is the first self - similar halo model which includes the effective heat conduction resulting from sidm collisionality . in section  [ fg_sect ] and [ hs_sect ] , we describe how sims with scale - free linear perturbations arise naturally from the gaussian random noise primordial density fluctuations , thus leading to the self - similar evolution of nonlinear structures .      in the einstein - de sitter ( eds )",

    "the accretion shock radius is guaranteed by self - similarity to be a fixed fraction of @xmath38 at all times .",

    "this postshock region is close to hydrostatic . for a collisionless gas",
    ", a similar description applies as long as the infalling matter initially had small ( or zero ) random motions . in that case , each mass shell collapses supersonically as a single stream until it encounters a region of shell - crossing and density caustics , which encompasses all previously collapsed ( i.e. interior ) mass shells .",
    "all collapsed mass shells inside this region oscillate about the centre .",

    "the collisional boltzmann equation for the evolution of the gas of cdm particles yields a set of fluid - like conservation equations under the assumptions of spherical symmetry and isotropic velocity distribution .",
    "the effect of self - interaction collisions is accounted for by an effective conductivity term in the energy equation .",
    "this conductivity is valid for arbitrarily large or small collision mean free path @xmath4 . * for an einstein - de sitter universe ( or a flat universe with cosmological constant , at early times when matter dominates ) , the nonlinear growth of perturbations which leads to halo formation in the spherical infall model can be described by similarity solutions in the absence of conductivity . in the presence of sidm conductivity ,",
    "self - similarity is still possible , but only for mass perturbations @xmath298 .",
    "remarkably , this self - similarity required in our solution is well - motivated and justified by the theory of halo formation from peaks of the gaussian random noise density fluctuations ( @xcite ) . for galactic haloes , which form from density fluctuations whose",
    "power spectrum can be approximated by a power law @xmath299 , the conditions required for this particular self - similarity naturally arise .",
    "* according to our similarity solutions , collisions of sidm transport heat from the hotter , outer halo region into the colder core region .",
    "this process flattens the central density , and continuous infall pumps energy into the halo which stabilizes the core against gravothermal catastrophe . *",
    "these solutions are characterized by a single dimensionless quantity , the collisionality parameter @xmath300 , where @xmath1 is the scattering cross section per unit mass , @xmath2 is the mean matter density , @xmath3 is halo virial radius and @xmath4 is the collision mean free path .",
    "the maximum flattening of central density occurs for an intermediate value of @xmath5 , @xmath301 , at which the halo is maximally relaxed to isothermality .",
    "the density profile of the @xmath6 solution matches that inferred from the observed rotation curves of dwarfs and low surface brightness galaxies ( lsb ) very well . * in the low-@xmath5 regime ( @xmath302 ) , flattening of the central density profile becomes _ stronger _ as @xmath5 increases .",
    "previous cosmological sidm n - body simulations with @xmath303    { \\rm cm}^{2 } { \\rm g}^{-1}$ ] lie in this regime ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "central density profiles became flatter as they increased the scattering cross - section , which is equivalent to increase in @xmath5 , because @xmath304 .",
    "on the contrary , in the high-@xmath5 regime ( @xmath12 ) , flattening of the central density becomes _ weaker _ as @xmath5 increases .",
    "this happens because the scattering mean free path becomes shorter as @xmath5 increases .",
    "sidm simulations which adopt a fully collisional limit to derive the maximal density flattening , which corresponds to ordinary gas dynamics ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , report that haloes obtain density profiles with central cusps as steep as or steeper than those in collisionless n - body simulations .",
    "this seemingly puzzling behaviour is easily explained : @xmath305 corresponds to @xmath306 , and therefore density flattening becomes negligible .",
    "* under the assumption that dwarfs and lsbs formed at their typical collapse epoch in @xmath8cdm , @xmath307 makes @xmath7 , much higher than previous estimates , @xmath308 { \\rm    cm}^{2 } { \\rm g}^{-1}$ ] , based on n - body experiments .",
    "this value of @xmath1 , independent of halo mass , would make @xmath12 for clusters , which typically formed only recently , resulting in relatively less flattening of their central density profile and a smaller core .",
    "a velocity dependent cross - section , @xmath309 , suggested by @xcite is thus unnecessary . *",
    "according to our similarity solutions , the solution for @xmath7 represents the solution most relaxed to isothermality inside the virialized postshock region .",
    "it is notable , therefore , that the @xmath7 solution is very similar to the nonsingular tis solution of @xcite for the post - collapse equilibrium structure of virialized haloes . the latter yields a mass profile almost indistinguishable from the mass profile of the burkert fit to the rotation curves of dwarf and lsb galaxies ( @xcite ) , as is the @xmath7 sidm profile we have derived here .",
    "this suggests that the tis halo model , which assumes that haloes are isothermal , is a natural outcome of the dynamical formation of cdm haloes when conductivity causes the halo to relax maximally toward isothermality .",
    "one may improve upon this work by performing a cosmological n - body simulation .",
    "as our analysis is based upon self - similarity , or a constant mass accretion rate @xmath310 , when the mass accretion rate deviates from this canonical rate , our analysis is no longer valid .",
    "several authors have investigated a realistic halo formation history both by an analytic approach and by n - body experiments , tracking the history of the `` most massive progenitor ( mmp ) '' .",
    "@xcite performed a cosmological n - body simulation and tracked the growth of mmp mass in a @xmath8cdm universe .",
    "@xcite calculated the growth of mmp for a power - law power spectrum and @xcite calculated it for a cdm power spectrum , both using the extended press - schechter theory .",
    "these studies show that mass accretion starts with a fast , rapid merger and ends with smooth , continuous accretion .",
    "this trend is clearly seen in equation ( [ wechsler - mass ] ) , where the logarithmic accretion rate is decreasing linearly with increasing scale factor @xmath311 .",
    "the accretion rate obtained in this way is different from what is expected from hs . for @xmath312 in the matter - dominated era",
    ", we find from equation ( [ growth ] ) that @xmath313 or @xmath314 .",
    "this fast accretion rate captures only the early mass accretion epoch given by equation ( [ wechsler - mass ] ) , and therefore , one should not apply this rate to the later epoch when mass accretion becomes negligible .",
    "this is the moment where the evolution of sidm haloes deviates from the self - similarity we assumed .    for cluster - mass haloes ,",
    "there is another reason that our assumption of self - similarity breaks down and should be improved in future work ; the value of @xmath47 which enters the self - similar infall model in @xmath8cdm actually depends weakly upon halo mass .",
    "the value we have adopted to ensure self - similarity in the presence of sidm collisionality , @xmath163 , is appropriate for the entire range of galactic halo masses .",
    "as figure [ fig - neff ] shows , however , @xmath47 increases with mass , and for clusters with mass above @xmath315 , @xmath316 . if @xmath317 , self - similarity is violated by the presence of sidm terms in the equations .",
    "since the accretion rate is lower if @xmath47 is higher ( i.e. @xmath318 ) , the flattening effect of sidm on the halo central density profile may be lower on cluster scales than expected from our self - similar solutions for @xmath163 .",
    "the mean free path @xmath4 is comparable to the gravitational scale height h in the core region . however , the ratio of the mean free path to the gravitational scale height becomes larger as the radius increases .",
    "see also figure [ fig - length ] , which includes other values of @xmath5 .",
    ", width=317 ]    does our prediction of high value of @xmath1 , @xmath319 , affect the abundance of dark matter substructure ?",
    "gravitational lensing flux anomalies have been interpreted as evidence for the existence of dark matter substructures in the parent halo ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the self - interacting dark matter , if real , would suppress the number of dark matter substructures to some extent .",
    "we are not sure at this stage , however , how strong this effect will be : the simple assumption of cold , continuous mass infall prevents us from making any strong prediction .",
    "we instead describe , in the following discussion , the complexity relating to two main mechanisms for suppressing the substructure formation when dark matter is collisional : ram - pressure stripping and thermal evaporation .",
    "one should also note that the interpretation of the lensing flux anomalies is not settled yet .",
    "recent analysis indicates that this anomaly may not require any substructure in the primary lens halo , but only the substructure in the intergalactic space ( @xcite ) .",
    "we now point out some caveats found in previous analyses , which also require more realistic , cosmological analysis . as many previous analytical estimates have been based on either isolated haloes or very simplified models , we believe that fully cosmological n - body simulations in the high-@xmath5 ( @xmath1 ) regime should be carried out to clarify this issue . for instance , the restriction coming from the susceptibility of sidm haloes to ram - pressure stripping ( @xcite ; @xcite ) may be relaxed if we remove the simplicity in their analysis .",
    "they determine the truncation radius of a galaxy in a cluster by the condition @xmath320 where @xmath321 is the velocity of the galaxy inside a cluster , @xmath322 is the density of the cluster at radius @xmath52 , @xmath323 is the density of the galaxy at its truncation radius @xmath324 , and @xmath325 is the internal velocity dispersion of the galaxy . equation ( [ ram ] ) is valid for highly collisional fluid .",
    "they then use the restriction that @xmath326 where @xmath4 is the collision mean free path and @xmath327 , which is @xmath328 for their fiducial case , is the surface density of a galaxy at @xmath324 .",
    "however , this is a crude way of describing the fluid regime where the equation ( [ ram ] ) can be applied .",
    "there exists a regime where the sidm can be treated as collisional only at the centre because the ratio of the mean free path to the gravitational scale height becomes larger as the radius of a galaxy increases ( see fig .",
    "[ [ fig - lengthqth ] ] ; when we express these length scales with dimensionless terms used for our similarity solutions , the scattering mean free path is @xmath329 , and the gravitational scale height is @xmath330 ) . in such cases , a `` global '' application of equation ( [ ram ] ) is not valid",
    ". ram - pressure stripping in this case would not be as severe as in the case of purely collisional fluid , because cluster sidm particles have a high probability of penetrating an sidm galactic halo deeply without experiencing collision at @xmath331 .",
    "therefore , to apply equation ( [ ram ] ) , we have to be more conservative in defining the fluid regime , which will relax the constraint @xmath332 ( @xcite ) set by equation ( [ eq - natarajan ] ) .",
    "@xcite constrained @xmath1 from their numerical and semi - analytical calculation of the evaporation time of elliptical galaxies embedded in a cluster environment .",
    "according to their analysis , such galactic haloes can evaporate within the age of the universe if @xmath333\\textrm{cm}^{2 } \\textrm{g}^{-1}$ ] .",
    "however , their analysis is based on a fixed cluster environment .",
    "consider a cosmological variant of this problem : for instance , an elliptical galaxy may form by a recent merger at @xmath334 when the temperature of the cluster , which only forms at @xmath335 , is very low .",
    "when the evaporation time is about the age of the universe ( @xmath336 ) , the elliptical galaxy has a fair chance to survive because the evaporation time is greater than the time from its formation epoch to the present .",
    "the excluded range of @xmath1 would then change substantially by shifting the marginal values , @xmath337 or @xmath338 , which correspond to the evaporation time of the order of the age of the universe . moreover , their analysis is only valid for either the very long mean free path limit or the very short mean free path limit .",
    "they exclude the intermediate regime at @xmath339 simply by an extrapolation of these two regimes .    because of these problems",
    ", we assert that a more refined , fully cosmological analysis and new cosmological n - body simulations with a wider range of @xmath1 values , including @xmath340 { \\rm cm}^{2 } { \\rm g}^{-1}$ ] , should be performed .",
    "even though our analysis here is fully cosmological , it is restricted by the fact that it is based on a constant logarithmic mass accretion rate ( i.e. @xmath341 for @xmath163 ) that provides self - similarity . however",
    ", a more realistic mass accretion history constructed from merger trees in n - body simulations shows a gradual decrease of the logarithmic mass accretion rate over time , as seen in equation ( [ wechsler - mass ] ) ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "when the mass accretion rate becomes very small at late times , the underlying halo properties will deviate significantly from self - similarity .",
    "moreover , the relatively high scattering cross - section which we find provides the best - fitting to dwarf galaxy rotation curves ",
    "@xmath342  has never been tested in cosmological sidm n - body simulations .",
    "we will explore these issues further in future work .",
    "we thank m. alvarez , s. shapiro , h. martel , i. iliev , and l. chuzhoy for helpful discussions . this work was supported by nasa astrophysical theory program grants",
    "nag5 - 10825 , nag5 - 10826 , nng04g177 g , and texas advanced research program grant 3658 - 0624 - 1999 .",
    "we show how we got @xmath65 for different mass scales .",
    "it is slightly different from the usual way to obtain @xmath65 by differentiating the rms mass fluctuation , @xmath66 .",
    "typically , one has @xmath343 where @xmath344 where @xmath172 is a mass enclosed by a sphere of radius @xmath345 which also defines the _ unperturbed _ mass @xmath55 through @xmath346 where @xmath347 is the present matter density and the average @xmath348 is taken over all positions of the centre of these spheres .",
    "this `` top - hat '' filtering results in a window function @xmath349 it is then straightforward to calculate @xmath65 as a function of @xmath55 using equation ( [ neff - sigma ] ) .",
    "however , we are interested in the @xmath65 which is valid if one considers the initial average overdensity around density peaks , @xmath350 ( hs ) .",
    "@xmath350 is given by @xmath351 where @xmath55 and @xmath352 are defined by equation ( [ tophatmass ] ) and ( [ window ] ) , respectively . from equation ( [ tophatmass ] ) and equation ( [ delta_0 ] )",
    ", we can see that for a power - law power spectrum @xmath49 , @xmath353 therefore , one can obtain @xmath65 as follows : @xmath354    the only difference in obtaining @xmath65 is then the power of the window function @xmath352 in equations ( [ sigma ] ) and ( [ delta_0 ] ) .",
