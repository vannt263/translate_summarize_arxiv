    "we will summarize basic ideas for applying generalized unitarity as a means for obtaining loop amplitudes from on - shell tree amplitudes .",
    "we will focus on @xmath0 super - yang - mills theory , in particular explaining how sums over intermediate states are conveniently evaluated using on - shell superspaces .",
    "up - to - date discussions of applications and further details of generalized unitarity may be found in the chapters of this review by britto  @xcite , by carrasco and johansson  @xcite and by ita  @xcite .",
    "the unitarity method has been applied to a wide variety of problems in phenomenology and more theoretical aspects of quantum field theory .",
    "this includes state - of - the - art predictions of lhc physics ( for example , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , including the first next - to - leading - order qcd calculation with five final state objects ( including jets )  @xcite . on the more theoretical side",
    ", it has been used to open a new venue  @xcite for studying maldacena s ads / cft correspondence  @xcite and perhaps eventually leading to a solution of planar @xmath0 super - yang - mills theory .",
    "it has also been used to unravel a dual conformal invariance in planar loop amplitudes of @xmath0 super - yang - mills theory  @xcite .",
    "applications to supergravity theories  @xcite have led to results that have rejuvenated hope for the absence of ultraviolet divergences for @xmath1 supergravity .",
    "( for recent discussions of this issue see refs .",
    "more recently , it has also played a key role in the conjecture of an all - loop - order duality between color and kinematics and the associated double - copy structure of gravity amplitudes in terms of gauge theory ones  @xcite .",
    "very recently it has also played a role in a new means for recursively finding multiloop multileg integrands in planar @xmath0 super - yang - mills theory  @xcite .",
    "the key feature of the unitarity method is that it constructs loop amplitudes directly from on - shell tree amplitudes .",
    "this makes it possible to carry over any newly identified property or symmetry of tree - level amplitudes to loop level .",
    "this may be contrasted with feynman diagrammatic methods , whose diagrams are inherently gauge dependent and off shell in intermediate states , making it difficult to exploit any simplifying properties of the on - shell tree amplitudes .",
    "unitarity has a long history in quantum field theory since its inception . for a discussion of applications of unitarity during the 1960 s ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite . however , a variety of difficulties prevented its widespread use as a means of constructing amplitudes , especially after the rise of gauge theories in the 1970 s .",
    "these difficulties included the need for subtractions ( meaning undetermined pieces ) , the inability to construct amplitudes beyond four points and difficulties with massless particles .",
    "these basic difficulties were overcome with the advent of the modern unitarity method  @xcite .    over the years",
    "there have been a number of important refinements to the unitarity method .",
    "generalized unitarity  @xcite ( where multiple internal lines are placed on shell , subdividing a loop amplitude into more than two pieces ) was first applied in ref .",
    "@xcite as a means for simplifying loop calculations .",
    "an important more recent development is the use of complex momenta  @xcite by britto , cachazo and feng  @xcite , leading to the realization that at one - loop in four dimensions , quadruple cuts directly determine the coefficients of all box integrals by freezing the loop integration .",
    "powerful new methods for dealing with triangle and bubble integrals at one - loop , as well as rational terms have also been developed  @xcite . these are described in other chapters of this review  @xcite . at higher loops , efficient means of constructing the integrands of amplitudes , including non - planar contributions , have also been devised  @xcite , as discussed in some detail in another chapter of this review  @xcite .",
    "although the unitarity method applies just as well to supersymmetric and non - supersymmetric theories , in general it is simpler to deal with the supersymmetric case because of the simpler analytic structure of such amplitudes . in particular , it turns out that the better power counting of supersymmetric theories allows all terms in one - loop scattering amplitudes to be readily captured by cuts composed of four - dimensional massless tree amplitudes .",
    "indeed , the first applications of the unitarity method were for one - loop supersymmetric amplitudes with arbitrary numbers of external legs , leading to remarkably compact results  @xcite . for qcd or even supersymmetric theories at higher loops ,",
    "the situation is more complex .",
    "the source of this additional complexity is that contributions that formally vanish in four dimensions may actually contribute because they interfere with divergences . at one - loop on - shell",
    "recursion relations can be used to construct the rational terms , entirely in four dimensions  @xcite .",
    "more generally , by computing in @xmath2 dimensions all rational terms are automatically captured  @xcite . a convenient way to implement this ,",
    "is by using six - dimensional helicity  @xcite .",
    "this offers many of the advantages of four - dimensional helicity , but meshes well with regularization of the divergences , in a manner consistent with unitarity  @xcite .",
    "besides regularization issues , there are a number of interesting questions in higher - dimensional theories accessible via six - dimensional techniques .",
    "for example , it has recently been used to confirm  @xcite that four - dimensional cuts do capture all terms in the four - loop four - point amplitudes of @xmath0 super - yang - mills theory  @xcite and @xmath3 supergravity  @xcite , which are relevant for higher - dimensional studies of ultraviolet divergences in these theories .",
    "another interesting application would be to confirm or refute the very interesting recent proposal that maximally supersymmetric yang - mills theory may be ultraviolet finite in five dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the present chapter of this review is organized as follows . after explaining the basics of the unitarity method",
    ", we illustrate this method for the one - loop four - point amplitude of @xmath0 super - yang - mills .",
    "we start by working out the amplitude in components",
    ". then we turn to more powerful superspace formalisms , first in four dimensions and then in six dimensions .",
    "we then present two nontrivial examples of how the unitarity method allows us to carry over on - shell tree - level properties to loop level . in the first of these examples we show that dual conformal covariance of tree amplitudes implies that loop - level integrands must transform nicely as well . in the second we will describe a duality between color and kinematics , showing the transition from trees to loops . in general ,",
    "tree properties carry over straightforwardly to generalized cuts that decompose a loop amplitude into a product of tree amplitudes .",
    "however , as the second example illustrates it can be nontrivial to demonstrate that a given property holds for the complete loop amplitude .",
    "4 truein      the simplest unitarity cuts to consider are the two - particle cuts .",
    "these are obtained by putting two intermediate lines on shell , as illustrated in for a four - point one - loop amplitude .",
    "for example , the @xmath4 channel cut in ( a ) is given by @xmath5 where the sum runs over all physical states in the theory .",
    "the cuts are evaluated using momenta that place all intermediate cut momenta on shell , @xmath6 , where the @xmath7 are masses . here",
    "we will take the theory to be massless .",
    "cuts are usually taken as including phase - space integrals , but for our purposes it is simpler to define them as not including the phase - space integration .",
    "an especially useful class of cuts are those that decompose a loop amplitude into a sum over @xmath8 tree amplitudes of form , @xmath9 where the sum runs over all physical states that can cross the cuts . in @xmath0 super - yang - mills theory ,",
    "it is especially useful to consider the maximal cuts  @xcite , ( also referred to as `` leading singularities ''  @xcite ) , where the maximum number of propagator lines are placed on shell .",
    "another useful class are single cuts where only a single internal line is placed on shell  @xcite ; these have played an important role in the construction of planar integrands of @xmath0 super - yang - mills theory via on - shell recursion  @xcite .    in general ,",
    "the complete amplitude is determined from a `` spanning set '' of cuts .",
    "such sets are found by considering all potential independent contributions to the integrand that can enter an amplitude ( and which do not integrate to zero ) , based on power counting or other constraints .",
    "one simply needs to ensure that all terms are non - vanishing in at least one cut that can then be used to determine its coefficient . in the @xmath0 case",
    "one can often construct an ansatz for the entire amplitude using various conjectured properties .",
    "once one has an ansatz , by confirming it over the spanning set , either numerically or analytically , we have a proof of the correctness of the ansatz .",
    "5 truein    one simple spanning set is obtained from the set of standard unitarity cuts , where a given amplitude is split into two lower - loop amplitudes , each with four or more external legs . at @xmath10 loops ,",
    "this is given by all cuts starting from the two - particle cut to the @xmath11-particle cut in all channels .",
    "we can convert this to a spanning set involving only tree amplitudes by iterating this process until no loops remain . to illustrate this procedure ,",
    "consider the two - loop four - point amplitude displayed in .",
    "in the first stage this is decomposed using two- and three - particle cuts . then in the second stage , the one - loop amplitude appearing in the two - particle cut is further decomposed into its two - particle cuts . in this figure we display only the topologically distinct diagrams ; the complete decomposition is determined by considering all cuts with distinct labels . if the amplitudes are color ordered then we need to maintain a fixed ordering of legs , depending on which planar or non - planar contribution is under consideration . on the other hand ,",
    "if they are dressed with color then the distinct permutations of legs enter each cut automatically .",
    "another spanning set that is especially useful in @xmath0 super - yang - mills theory is obtained  @xcite by starting from `` maximal cuts '' , where the maximum numbers of internal propagators are placed on shell .",
    "these maximal cuts decompose the amplitudes into products of three - point tree amplitudes , summed over the states crossing the cuts . to construct a spanning set",
    "we systematically release cut conditions one by one , first considering cases with one internal line off shell , then two internal lines off shell and so forth . each time a cut condition is released ,",
    "potential contact terms which would not be visible at earlier steps are captured .",
    "the process terminates when the only remaining potential contact terms exceed power counting requirements of the theory ( or integrate to zero in dimensional regularization ) . for the case of maximal supersymmetry  especially in the planar case ",
    "there are a large variety of additional tricks and techniques for obtaining contributions efficiently  @xcite .",
    "many of these are discussed further by carrasco and johansson in another chapter of this review  @xcite .",
    "5 truein    6.5 truein    given a spanning set of unitarity cuts , the task is to then find an expression for the integrand of the amplitude with the correct cuts in all channels .",
    "this can be done either in a forward or reverse direction . in the forward direction the different cuts are merged into integrands with no cut conditions using a merging procedure described in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the reverse direction",
    "we first construct an ansatz for the amplitude containing unknown parameters which are then determined by taking generalized cuts of the ansatz and comparing to the cuts of the amplitude . the reverse direction is usually preferred because we can expose desired properties , simply by imposing them on the ansatz and then checking if its unitarity cuts are correct .      to illustrate the forward way of proceeding ,",
    "consider a two - loop four - point amplitude .",
    "in particular , consider those contributions which contain the propagators of the double - box integral displayed in , @xmath12 the key task is to determine the numerator factor @xmath13 from the unitarity cuts . as illustrated in , the three - particle cut in the @xmath14 channel will have three contributions .",
    "the horizontal double box gives two distinct contributions to the cut , while the vertical double box gives only a single contribution .",
    "when reassembling the contribution from the cuts we need to account for this relative double count in the horizontal box . a procedure for doing so is by adding together the two horizontal box contributions , but subtracting out the overlap , to prevent a double count , as illustrated in .",
    "prior to adding the two contributions ( a ) and ( b ) in we must switch from cut labels used in diagram ( a ) to the diagram momentum labels , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , so that uniform momentum labels are used when combining the contributions .",
    "note that the contributions ( a ) and ( b ) each require a different change of variables . for diagram ( a )",
    "we require @xmath17 while for diagram ( b ) we require @xmath18 the third term on the right hand side of is the `` overlap '' between the numerator contributions ( a ) and ( b ) which must be subtracted out to prevent double counts .",
    "the overlap term is determined by taking contribution ( a ) and imposing the additional cut conditions of diagram ( b ) . in carrying this out ,",
    "it is important that terms which vanish by the cut conditions are set to zero .",
    "this is best accomplished by expressing the numerator in terms of inverse propagators , whenever possible .",
    "a key consistency condition is that the overlap terms need to be the same if we swap the roles of ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "( in explicit calculations it is helpful to always check this consistency condition , since it will catch most errors . )",
    "this merging procedure generalizes to any set of cuts . in general , we can write a gauge - theory amplitude as a sum over integrals , @xmath19 where the @xmath20 are symmetry factors , the @xmath21 color factors , the @xmath22 some loop integrals and the sum runs over all contributing integrals . the loop integrals are of the form , @xmath23 where the @xmath24 are numerators",
    ". the numerators can be local or non - local depending on the chosen organization .",
    "the product in the denominator runs over all propagators in the graph . each cut contribution",
    "is then assigned to a graph according to the propagators it contains and the merging procedure is carried out for each graph . for each set of propagators specifying an integral function , one must add together the contributions from each cut , subtracting any overlap .",
    "a detailed discussion of this procedure may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we note that the merging procedure is not limited to planar supersymmetric theories and has been successfully applied to qcd  @xcite . in special cases , such as @xmath0",
    "super - yang - mills theory at one loop , the merging procedure is rather simple , because we can make use of the fact that the amplitude is determined solely from box integrals  @xcite , whose coefficients may be determined directly from quadruple cuts  @xcite .      in practical calculations ,",
    "it is usually simpler to work in the reverse direction , by first constructing an ansatz for the numerators containing all potential terms that can appear .",
    "the numerators can depend on the momenta , polarizations and spinors and contain parameters to be determined from the cuts . when using superamplitudes , the numerators will depend on anticommuting parameters as well .    to determine the unknown numerical coefficients we take generalized cuts of the ansatz and systematically set these equal to the cuts of the loop amplitude .",
    "usually it is best to enforce a set of auxiliary constraints , such as demanding an upper limit to the number of powers of loop momenta that that can appear in the numerators of the integrands .",
    "depending on the situation , one can , for example , impose that each numerator is a polynomial in the loop and external momenta .",
    "one can greatly reduce the number of cuts required to determine the amplitude by feeding in additional information , such as dual conformal symmetry for the planar @xmath0 super - yang - mills amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "this procedure is simplest for the four - point amplitudes of @xmath0 super - yang - mills theory , where it turns out that the ratio between the loop integrand and the tree amplitudes is a rational function solely of lorentz invariant scalar products , at least through four loops and very likely beyond this  @xcite . for higher - point amplitudes ,",
    "similar ratios can contain either spinor products or levi - civita tensors .",
    "if it turns out that no solution to the cut conditions is found , the ansatz then needs to be enlarged by removing auxiliary constraints .",
    "a given cut configuration will not completely fix the ansatz as the numerator may be freely modified by adding terms that vanish on the cut under study .",
    "consider , for example , a particular two - particle cut with cut momenta labeled @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "expressions proportional to @xmath27 and @xmath28 are not constrained by this particular cut .",
    "such terms are instead constrained by other cuts .",
    "after information from all cuts is included , the only remaining ambiguities are terms that are free of cuts in _ every _ channel . in the full amplitude",
    "these ambiguities add up to zero , representing the freedom to re - express the amplitude in different equivalent forms .",
    "this freedom allows us to find representations with different desirable properties , such as manifest symmetries or power countings  @xcite .    for multiloop calculations in @xmath0 super - yang - mills theory ,",
    "it is usually helpful to organize the evaluation of the cuts following the method of maximal cuts  @xcite .",
    "this allows us to focus on a relatively small number of terms , as well as reducing the complexity of each cut . a related procedure , valid for maximally supersymmetric amplitudes , makes use of `` leading - singularities ''  @xcite .",
    "these leading singularities , which include additional hidden singularities , likely determine any maximally supersymmetric amplitude , once additional symmetry information is incorporated  @xcite .",
    "similar constructions can also be done in supergravity theories .",
    "however , it is generally simpler to construct loop amplitudes in these theories by first evaluating corresponding super - yang - mills loop amplitudes which can then be using directly in the evaluation of the supergravity cuts  @xcite , using either the tree - level klt  @xcite relations or the double - copy bcj relations  @xcite .",
    "in fact , it appears likely that one can read off multiloop supergravity amplitudes directly from the corresponding gauge - theory amplitudes after they are arranged in a form that satisfies a color - kinematics duality  @xcite .",
    "one important technical issue is that amplitudes are in general divergent and need to be regularized . for most purposes , the most convenient regularization scheme is dimensional regularization .",
    "for planar @xmath0 super - yang - mills theory only infrared divergences are present , and in this case a massive higgs regulator has proven to be especially convenient  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this form of massive regularization is closely related to dimensional regularization , and obtained by treating the extra dimensional components of momenta as masses not to be integrated over  @xcite .    at one loop , all contributions to the amplitudes of massless supersymmetric theories",
    "are determined completely by their four - dimensional cuts  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , no such theorem has been proven at higher loops .",
    "there is , however , substantial evidence that it holds for four - point amplitudes in this theory through six loops  @xcite .",
    "we do not expect that it will continue for higher - point amplitudes .",
    "indeed , we know that for two - loop six - point amplitudes , terms which vanish in @xmath29 do contribute in dimensional regularization  @xcite .",
    "however , it may well turn out that all terms not determined by four - dimensional massless cuts have a predictable universal structure , at least near four dimensions .",
    "interestingly , experience indicates that when using the massive regulator , we can safely drop all terms of order @xmath8 , where @xmath8 is the effective mass obtained from the extra - dimensional components  @xcite .",
    "until theorems are proven determining when four - dimensional massless cuts are sufficient to guarantee that all terms are captured , by evaluating cuts in higher dimensions we can ensure their reliability .",
    "in general , using @xmath30-dimensional momenta  @xcite makes calculations significantly more clumsy , because powerful spinor and superspace methods  @xcite are no longer applicable .",
    "however , thanks to refs .",
    "@xcite , we now have helicity and superspace formalisms in six dimensions analogous to the well known four - dimensional ones . in many cases",
    "this is sufficient , allowing for straightforward constructions of dimensionally or massively regularized amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "this then offers a convenient way to construct regularized integrands that are guaranteed to be consistent with unitarity .",
    "for relatively simple amplitudes , the sum over states in a cut ( [ generalizedcut ] ) can be evaluated straightforwardly in components  @xcite . as we discuss in subsequent sections , for more complex situations where the bookkeeping becomes more difficult , the sums over states",
    "are best handled  @xcite using on - shell superspaces  @xcite .",
    "as a simple example where a component analysis is adequate , consider a four - gluon amplitude of @xmath0 super - yang - mills theory .",
    "this amplitude was first computed in ref .",
    "@xcite , as the low - energy limit of a type  i string . for the purposes of illustrating the cut construction",
    ", we may view this amplitude as an ordinary gauge - theory amplitude but with a particular matter content : one gluon , four gluinos and six real scalars all in the adjoint representation .",
    "in supersymmetric theories amplitudes with identical helicity or with one leg of opposite helicity ( in an all outgoing convention ) vanish to all loop orders by a supersymmetry identity  @xcite .",
    "( a discussion of supersymmetry identities can be found in another chapter of this review  @xcite . ) the first non - trivial case to consider is the four - point case with two negative and two positive helicities , @xmath31 .    in general , we can write the color - ordered amplitude as @xmath32 where we have extracted an overall factor of the tree amplitude .",
    "( the amplitude is the coefficient of the color trace @xmath33 for an su(@xmath34 ) gauge group . )",
    "our task is to determine the numerator factor @xmath13 from the cuts .",
    "we have chosen to write the amplitude entirely as a box integral . in this representation , if any triangle or bubble contributions were to appear they would enter as inverse propagators in the numerator canceling propagators .    for simplicity",
    ", we will work this out using four - dimensional momenta .",
    "as mentioned above , in general , this can lead to terms being dropped , but supersymmetric amplitudes at one loop are known not to contain additional terms  @xcite . in carrying out this calculation",
    "we assume the relevant tree - level amplitudes are already known , so we just quote their form  @xcite .",
    "first consider the @xmath4-channel cut depicted in ( a ) .",
    "the necessary tree amplitudes are the four - gluon amplitudes , @xmath35 where @xmath36 denote spinor inner products following the notation of ref .",
    "all other combinations of helicities of the intermediate lines cause at least one of the tree amplitudes on either side of the cut to vanish .",
    "( the outgoing - particle helicity convention means that the helicity label for each intermediate line flips when crossing the cut . )",
    "remarkably , for this cut only the gluon loop contributes ; for fermion or scalar loops at least one of the two tree amplitudes vanish . using the tree amplitudes ( [ treefourampls ] ) ,",
    "the cut in the @xmath4 channel depicted in ( a ) is simply , @xmath37 where we used the assignment that @xmath38 and @xmath39=|p]$ ] such that @xmath40 . to put this into a form more reminiscent of integrals encountered in feynman diagram calculations we rationalize the denominators using , for example , @xmath41 where we set @xmath42 , @xmath43 and we used the on - shell conditions @xmath44 . performing these simplifications yields @xmath45 where",
    "we have extracted a overall factor of the tree amplitude from the amplitude , @xmath46 the numerator @xmath47 is given by @xmath48 \\nn \\\\ & = & - 4 \\tr_+[4321]\\ ,   l_1 \\cdot k_1 \\",

    ", we find that @xmath53 has the correct @xmath4-channel cut , where @xmath54 is the box integral , @xmath55    now consider the @xmath56 channel shown in ( b ) . in this case , all particles in the multiplet contribute to the cut .",
    "we label the states according to their helicity @xmath57 . in this case",
    "the two tree - level amplitudes on either side of the cuts are given by @xmath58 in @xmath0 super - yang - mills theory the helicity @xmath57 takes on values , @xmath59 .",
    "these amplitudes can be obtained from the purely gluonic ones , using supersymmetry ward identities  @xcite or by extracting the components from superspace amplitudes , discussed below .",
    "the @xmath56-channel cut is given by multiplying the two amplitudes and summing over all intermediate states .",
    "this gives us @xmath60 where the factor @xmath61 contains the contributions from the gluon , four gluinos and six real scalars , @xmath62 to obtain the final line we made use of a schouten identity  @xcite .",
    "thus , the @xmath56 channel cut collapses to a relabeling of the @xmath4 channel cut ( [ schannelcut ] ) .",
    "following similar algebra as for the @xmath4 channel cut we obtain @xmath63 at this point , from it is clear that the correct amplitude must be @xmath64 because it has the correct cuts in both the @xmath4 and @xmath56 channels . in this case",
    "the merging procedure for the cuts turns out to be trivial because the numerator does not contain loop momentum .",
    "more complex cases both at one and higher loops are discussed in other chapters of this review  @xcite .",
    "progress has also been made using cuts with only a single cut propagator  @xcite .",
    "for problems involving supersymmetric amplitudes , it is usually best to use an on - shell superspace which organizes the amplitudes according to physical helicity states .",
    "this provides a convenient means for dealing with all states of the theory simultaneously , and for carrying out intermediate sums of states crossing cuts .",
    "the superspace we discuss here consists of unconstrained grassmann variables which form a fundamental representation of the su@xmath66 r - symmetry group .",
    "the unconstrained nature of the variables makes it simple to translate summations of on - shell states needed in unitarity cuts into grassmann integrations , which take care of the bookkeeping .",
    "we begin with a brief setup of the formalism .",
    "( see also the chapter of this review from brandhuber , spence and travaglini  @xcite . )",
    "the on - shell superspace is constructed by introducing a set of fermionic variables @xmath67 , with @xmath68 transforming in the fundamental representation of su@xmath66 r - symmetry .",
    "the bosonic spinor variables carry kinematic information , while the fermionic variables carry information on the helicity and r - symmetry representation of the external states . @xmath65",
    "super - yang - mills has a simple structure because all states can be incorporated into a self cpt superfield , @xmath69 we note that @xmath3 supergravity is similar , with a self cpt multiplet in four dimensions containing fields up to spin 2 .",
    "these fermionic variables were first introduced by ferber  @xcite to extend twistors , which are representations of four - dimensional conformal group , to supertwistors .",
    "nair  @xcite applied these variables to represent mhv amplitudes of @xmath65 super - yang - mills theory .",
    "these amplitudes take the form @xmath70 where leg @xmath71 is to be identified with leg @xmath72 , and @xmath73 the component amplitudes are the coefficients in the @xmath74 expansion of @xmath75 , with the external states identified according to their organization within the superfield as in .",
    "an mhv superamplitude of @xmath76 super - yang - mills can also be written as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the tree - level mhv pure - gluon amplitude .",
    "we note that the mhv superamplitudes of @xmath1 supergravity has a similar form @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a tree - level mhv pure - graviton amplitude .",
    "it is natural to expect that superamplitudes for theories with fewer supersymmetries are simply given by subamplitudes of the maximal theory .",

    "@xcite , by grouping r - symmetry indices , one obtains amplitudes for the gauge multiplet of lower supersymmetric theories .",
    "the most trivial example is that the amplitudes of pure non - supersymmetric yang - mills theory are just the pure gluon amplitudes of @xmath0 super - yang - mills theory , since all other states decouple from these amplitudes .",
    "in fact , by making appropriate projections , one can even obtain qcd amplitudes with quarks from @xmath0 tree amplitudes  @xcite , leading to compact forms of qcd amplitudes .    as a simple example",

    "using grassmann integration to sum the internal states we have @xmath202 where the @xmath203 and @xmath204 signify sums over the legs on the left and right sides of the cut in ( a ) . pulling out the overall supermomentum delta function we arrive at @xmath205 where we used @xmath206 , and the explicit form of the four - point superamplitude in to obtain the final line .",
    "this answer matches the naive continuation of the four - dimensional result ( [ d4cutresult ] ) to six dimensions .",
    "thus , when extending the four - dimensional expressions either to dimensional regularization or to massively regularized expressions , all terms are properly captured .",
    "the situation is not so simple for cases with fewer supersymmetries or with larger numbers of loops and legs . in these cases",
    "the six - dimensional formalism can ensure that no contributions are dropped in the regularization or when extending the results to higher dimensions .",
    "we now explain how the unitarity method helps us to carry over novel tree - level properties to loop level .",
    "in particular , symmetries of tree - level amplitudes can be carried over to loop level if one can show that all unitarity cuts , combined with the cut propagators , transform in a universal covariant fashion . in doing so",
    ", one also needs to track the effect of regularization . in this section",
    "we will use dual conformal symmetry as an example showing how the unitarity method can be used to carry over tree properties to loop level and to illustrate regularization issues .",
    "a more complex situation arises when the symmetry or property is directly affected by the cut conditions or when the property is not global .",
    "this makes it more difficult to prove that the property carries over to loop level .",
    "nevertheless , the unitarity method offers a powerful tool for studying the property at loop level and for formulating conjectures .",
    "we shall illustrate this situation using the recently discovered duality between color and kinematics  @xcite .",
    "as discussed earlier , dual conformal symmetry is a conformal symmetry in the dual @xmath101-space , where @xmath101 is defined in terms of momenta , as given in .",
    "this can be extended to a dual superconformal symmetry by introducing the fermionic coordinates  @xcite , @xmath207 once the superamplitudes are written in these dual super coordinates , the dual conformal property can be straightforwardly established through the relationship between the conformal boost generator and the translation generator , @xmath208 where @xmath209 is the inversion operator .",

    "below we describe the effect of the regulator .",
    "our discussion will follow the analogous @xmath220 discussion of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "to study the inversion properties in the unitarity cuts , it is more convenient to separate the ( super)momentum delta functions from the rest of the tree amplitude . for amplitudes with four or more external legs",
    ", we have @xmath221=\\biggl(\\prod^n_{i=1}x_i^2\\biggr)f_n\\,.\\ ] ]    we now convert the supersum , which are integrations over @xmath74s , into integrations over @xmath210 .",
    "we first note that the total number of dual points for a loop amplitude is @xmath222 , where @xmath10 is the loop order and @xmath100 the number of external legs .",
    "the supercut is given by @xmath223 where we assume the cut is part of a spanning set involving only tree amplitudes with four or more external legs .",
    "the product over @xmath224 only runs over internal cut lines while the product over @xmath225 runs over the tree subamplitudes .",
    "next we use the identity , @xmath226\\left [ \\prod_{\\{rs\\}}\\delta^8\\left(\\theta_r-\\theta_s-\\lambda_{\\{rs\\}}\\eta_{\\{rs\\}}\\right)\\right]\\ , , \\label{identity}\\ ] ] where the product over @xmath227 runs over all lines . since the translation from supermomentum to dual @xmath210 coordinates has an overall shift symmetry , the integration measure @xmath228 is understood to include only @xmath229 of them . to see the equality ( [ firststage ] ) ,",
    "one notes that on the lhs the delta functions can be used to localize the @xmath230 integrals . denoting the total number of lines , internal or external , as @xmath231",
    ", there are then @xmath232 delta functions left . for planar diagrams , @xmath233 , where @xmath234 is the number of tree amplitudes in the cut .",
    "thus , one is left with the supermomentum delta functions for each tree amplitude , as claimed .",
    "replacing @xmath235 in by , we can now integrate the @xmath74s . using the super delta functions to replace the @xmath74s in @xmath236 with @xmath210s ,",
    "the remaining @xmath74 dependence then comes solely from the delta functions .",
    "the @xmath74 integral then simply gives @xmath237 where now @xmath227 only runs over the external lines . pulling out an overall supermomentum delta function , the remaining @xmath238 delta functions in the product over @xmath227",
    "can be used to localize part of the @xmath239 integration , leaving only the internal dual points .",
    "we are finally left with @xmath240 where the product over @xmath241 now runs only over the internal dual point labels . to calculate the inversion weight of a given cut",
    ", we follow the weight of each contributing piece :    * for every internal loop label @xmath241 , the @xmath242 measure contributes a factor @xmath243 .",
    "* each internal leg @xmath224 contributes @xmath244 which comes from @xmath245 . *",
    "each tree - level subamplitude @xmath236 contributes @xmath246 , where @xmath149 runs over all tree dual labels .    after restoring the cut propagators ,",
    "which invert as @xmath247=i\\left[\\frac{1}{x^2_{ij}}\\right]=\\frac{x_i^2x_j^2}{x^2_{ij}}\\,,\\ ] ] and combining with the other inversion factors , we see that each planar cut inverts with the overall prefactor , @xmath248 where @xmath249 are internal dual points .",
    "one can extend this result to cuts involving three - point subamplitudes , though as noted above this is unnecessary because spanning sets of cuts without these exist .",
    "if we ignore regularization issues and include the four - dimensional loop integration measure , the measure will provide an extra inversion weight of @xmath250 , which exactly cancels the extra weight of internal dual points coming from the integrand . in any case , the key result is that all cuts have the same inversion weight . because there is a uniform inversion for all cuts ,",
    "we conclude that the @xmath10-loop amplitude prior to integration must invert as given in .",
    "as noted earlier , for the discussion to hold after integration we need a regulator , given the presence of infrared divergences .",
    "fortunately , for @xmath0 super - yang - mills , there are natural and easy to implement regulators .",
    "one option is to use dimensional regularization and the other a massive regulator  @xcite . in either case ,",
    "the simplest way to study the dual conformal properties is to use the six - dimensional helicity and superspace formalism . with the six - dimensional language",
    "we then have simple way to prove the dual conformal properties in the regularized @xmath29 theory to all loop orders , using generalized unitarity    as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , following similar steps as the four - dimensional case outlined above , the six - dimensional integrand for the @xmath10-loop amplitude inverts in the same fashion as the four - dimensional integrand . to do",
    "so we simply need to extend the dual conformal transformations to act also on the extra - dimensional components  @xcite ( or equivalently masses  @xcite ) . inserting back the loop momentum integral and the overall momentum and supermomentum delta functions",
    ", the inversion weight differs from by extra powers of the @xmath251 .",
    "these are due to solely the extra components in the loop integration measure and the momentum delta functions .    on the other hand ,",
    "if we treat the extra dimensional components as masses , then the loop - momentum integration measure factors and momentum delta functions are identical to the four - dimensional case . from the four - dimensional point of view",
    ", the momentum of the extra dimensions is to be identified as regulator masses , and hence should not be integrated over .",
    "thus , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the massively regulated amplitude inverts as in , and dual conformal symmetry holds in massively regulated planar @xmath0 amplitudes to all loop orders , as expected  @xcite .",
    "this may contrasted with dimensional regularization , where the symmetry is anomalous because the inversion weights of the internal dual points do not properly cancel .      as a second more intricate example",
    ", we consider the question of carrying over a newly discovered duality between color and kinematics from tree level to loop level .",
    "( for further details on this duality see the chapter in this review from carrasco and johansson  @xcite . )    to understand the proposed duality , we first rearrange an @xmath10-loop amplitude with all particles in the adjoint representation into the form , @xmath252 where the sum runs over the set of @xmath100-point @xmath10-loop diagrams with only cubic vertices .",
    "these include distinct permutations of external legs , and the @xmath253 are the symmetry factors of each diagram .",
    "the form ( [ loopbcj ] ) can be obtained straightforwardly , for example , from feynman diagrams , by representing all contact terms as inverse propagators in the kinematic numerators that cancel propagators .",
    "we suppress factors of the coupling constant for convenience .",
    "the product in the denominator runs over all propagators of each cubic diagram .",
    "the @xmath21 are the color factors obtained by dressing every three vertex with an @xmath254 structure constant , and the @xmath24 are kinematic numerator factors depending on momenta , polarizations and spinors . for supersymmetric amplitudes expressed in superspace , there will also be grassmann parameters in the numerators .",
    "-.1 cm    according to the color - kinematics duality proposal of refs .",
    "@xcite , arrangements of the diagrammatic numerators in exist such that they satisfy equations in one - to - one correspondence with the color jacobi identities .",
    "that is , for every color jacobi identity we have a relation between kinematic numerators , @xmath255 for example , as illustrated in , the numerators of the three displayed diagrams satisfy a similar equation as satisfied by the color factors of the diagram .",
    "perhaps more remarkable than the duality itself , is a related conjecture that once the gauge - theory amplitudes are arranged into a form satisfying the duality ( [ bcjduality ] ) , corresponding gravity amplitudes can be obtained simply by taking a double copy of gauge - theory numerator factors  @xcite , @xmath256 where the @xmath257 represent numerator factors of a second gauge theory amplitude , the sum runs over the same set of diagrams as in .",
    "we suppressed the gravitational coupling constant in this expression .",
    "this is expected to hold in a large class of gravity theories , including theories that are the low - energy limits of string theories .",
    "it should also hold in pure gravity , but in this case extra projectors would be required to remove the unwanted states arising in the direct product of two pure yang - mills theories . at tree level ( @xmath258 ) , this double - copy property is closely related to the klt relations between gravity and gauge theory  @xcite .    for the tree case , through use of bcfw recursion",
    ", the double - copy formula ( [ loopbcjgrav ] ) has been proven for pure gravity and for @xmath3 supergravity tree amplitudes in @xmath29 , assuming the duality  ( [ bcjduality ] ) holds in the corresponding gauge theories  @xcite . at tree level",
    "a consequence of this duality is non - trivial relations between the color - ordered partial amplitudes of gauge theory  @xcite .",
    "the duality has also been studied in string theory  @xcite .",
    "this duality has also been discussed from the lagrangian vantage point in ref .",
    "recently , an alternative trace - based representation of the color - kinematics duality was given in  @xcite .",
    "the non - trivial part of the all - loop conjecture ( [ bcjduality ] ) is that there is sufficient freedom to arrange gauge - theory multiloop amplitudes in a way that satisfies the color - kinematics duality ( [ bcjduality ] ) . to analyze whether the conjecture is plausible",
    ", we can use the unitarity method .",
    "the present situation is more complicated than the previous example of dual conformal symmetry . in the dual conformal case ,",
    "when intermediate momenta are placed on shell , the properties are essentially unchanged .",
    "this allows the dual conformal properties to easily be carried to loop level , since they hold globally for all cuts . in the present case ,",
    "when a line is cut , we lose the jacobi - like relation involving that line , altering the system of equations enforcing the duality .",
    "in addition , the remaining numerator relations become simpler because of the extra on - shell cut conditions . the duality ( [ bcjduality ] )",
    "is implemented as a collection of identities which act locally on diagrams , but which have global consistency implications .",
    "the cuts do not need to satisfy the complete set of duality relations satisfied by the loop amplitude , but only a subset .",
    "this makes proving that the color - kinematics duality holds for loop amplitudes more difficult than proving that dual conformal covariance holds in the planar case .",
    "indeed , we still do not have a proof that the color - kinematics duality holds to all loop orders .",
    "whether it does depends on the balance between the number of constraints and the freedom to rearrange the amplitudes as the loop order increases .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that the duality ( [ bcjduality ] ) holds for _ all _ cuts decomposing loop amplitudes to sums of products of tree amplitudes , assuming it holds at tree level , is a key motivation for extending it to all loop orders  @xcite .",
    "of course , given that we do not yet have a proof that the color - kinematics duality holds , it is important to check it in explicit examples . the unitarity method has been used to provide such examples .",
    "the one- and two - loop four - point amplitudes of @xmath0 super - yang - mills theory and @xmath3 supergravity , as obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , are easily shown to satisfy the conjecture ( [ bcjduality ] ) .",
    "another example is the two - loop four - point identical - helicity amplitude of pure yang - mills theory  @xcite , which also has been shown to satisfy the duality  @xcite .",
    "finally , a rather nontrivial example is the three - loop four - point amplitude of @xmath0 super - yang - mills theory  @xcite .",
    "this example is discussed further in another chapter of this review  @xcite , including a discussion of how the color - kinematics duality can be exploited to simplify calculations of the generalized cuts .",
    "in summary , generalized unitarity is an established tool for carrying out loop calculations in gauge and gravity theories , having led to a variety of new nontrivial results .",
    "here we summarized four - dimensional and six - dimensional versions , making use of helicity and on - shell superspaces .",
    "the six - dimensional version offers a means of regularizing amplitudes , while retaining key advantages of the four - dimensional version .",
    "the unitarity method also offers a straightforward means for carrying any identified tree - level property to loop level . as particular examples , we discussed dual conformal symmetry as well as a new duality between color and kinematics .",
    "we expect that in the coming years , generalized unitarity will continue to play a leading role in new calculations and for uncovering exciting new properties of scattering amplitudes .",
