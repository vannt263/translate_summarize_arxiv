    "it is well known that the quantum properties of classically chaotic systems differ considerably from their classical versions  @xcite .",
    "the quantum dynamics of a classically chaotic system with a finite number of degrees of freedom is considerably more regular than its classical counterpart , as indicated by the structures developed by wigner distributions in phase space for simple systems , and the fact that almost all definitions of the quantum mechanical version of the kolmogorov - sinai rate of entropy production give the value zero for finite quantum systems that are classically chaotic with positive kolmogorov - sinai entropy  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is often difficult to describe the behavior of quantum systems for both long times and for small values of planck s constant , _",
    "i.e. _ in the semi - classical regime .",
    "this difficulty is related to the fact that the long time limit and the limit of small planck constant do not commute , in addition to analytical problems that often make explicit solutions of the equations for quantum systems difficult .",
    "therefore it is of some interest to study simple models where both the quantum and classical properties are accessible to analytic and simple numerical studies , and where the two limits can be studied in detail .",
    "one example is the baker map .",
    "the classical version of this map is tractable analytically  @xcite , and the quantum version is less so  @xcite , but easily studied using numerical methods .",
    "it is even more challenging to study transport problems in detail . in recent years",
    "some attention has been devoted to connecting macroscopic transport properties with microscopic chaos , see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite and other contributions to this volume .",
    "we find it of interest to study the quantum signatures of these relations and look for their appearance in the semi - classical regime .",
    "to gain intuition about the change in the character of transport properties from quantum to classical regime a convenient system to study is the uniform , periodic multi - baker map .",
    "our interest in this map is stimulated by the fact that the classical version is a chaotic system with transport , in this case , diffusion , so it provides a model where one can study transport in the context of chaotic dynamics .",
    "both the classical  @xcite and quantum  @xcite versions of the multi - baker map are based upon the baker map , which in its classical version is an area preserving , expanding and contracting transformation of the 2-torus onto itself .",
    "the multi - baker map is obtained by considering a two dimensional strip of unit height in the @xmath4-direction and a segment of the real @xmath5-axis , either of infinite length in both directions or of finite length with specified boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "the multi - baker transformation is a combination of the baker map with a translation of points in each unit interval to corresponding points in the nearest intervals to the right or left according to a well defined prescription , to be given below .",
    "the quantum versions of these maps are obtained by means of a simple quantization where the @xmath5-axis is taken to correspond to position space , and the @xmath4-direction is taken to correspond to momentum space  @xcite .",
    "the quantum mechanics is obtained by requiring that there be an integral number of quantum states in a unit interval , and that the time development of these states correspond to the expanding and contracting properties of the classical map .",
    "balazs and voros  @xcite , and saraceno  @xcite were able to show that these requirements can be satisfied by means of a unitary operation on the quantum states , provided planck s constant is taken to be the inverse of the number of quantum states in the unit square .",
    "our work has been devoted to extending this quantum baker map to a quantum multi - baker map and examining the transport properties of this quantum map  @xcite .",
    "other quantizations of multibaker maps as well as the kapral - elskens coupled baker model have been studied in  @xcite    in this paper we focus on the calculation of the mean square displacement ( msd ) of a particle whose dynamics is described by a quantum multi - baker map .",
    "this quantity is of importance for the description of the average motion of a particle , since the time dependence of this quantity can distinguish between sub - diffusive , diffusive , and super - diffusive motion .",
    "a particular example of super - diffusive motion is , of course , ballistic motion characteristic of the motion of a free particle .    in the classical multi - baker",
    ", the msd grows linearly in time , @xmath6 , characteristic of diffusion , for all times greater than some microscopic time .",
    "the quantum version shows an asymptotic ballistic , @xmath7 , growth for what we will call uniform maps , which are translationally invariant .",
    "this is essentially the same as one finds in models of electron transport in periodic solids , such as the krnig - penney model  @xcite .",
    "one can find examples of non - translationally invariant multi - bakers where the particle is localized with no asymptotic growth of the msd with time .",
    "here we consider only translationally invariant models , and leave the large class of non - translationally invariant models for future work .",
    "the classical multi - baker map  @xcite is a simple model for deterministic diffusion along a one - dimensional lattice .",
    "it can easily be constructed to be isomorphic to a random walk with any given probabilities for jumping to the right and to the left along the lattice .",
    "the quantum multi - baker map  @xcite is also an example of a random walk , but in this case , the walk is quantum mechanical and has very different properties from the classical map due to the interference of probability amplitudes for possible paths .",
    "the subject of quantum random walks has developed a literature over the past few years . here",
    "we will also discuss the connection of the quantum multi - baker with other models of quantum walks .",
    "we mention now that most of the previous studies by other authors have been devoted to the so - called hadamard walk  @xcite , which is a special case of the quantum multi - baker for the largest allowed value of planck s constant .",
    "thus the multi - baker map studied here represents a generalization of the hadamard walk to all allowed values of planck s constant .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : qmb ]",
    "we present the basic equations defining the quantum multi - baker map and compare it to the classical version . in section  [ sec : msd ] we discuss the msd for the quantum map , and in section  [ sec : rmt ] show how random matrix theory may be used to evaluate the msd for small values of planck s constant , leaving some technical details for a longer paper  @xcite . in section  [ sec : numerics ] we compare the results of random matrix theory with numerical studies of the map , which shows that random matrix theory is quite effective in reproducing the numerical results and in providing an expression showing the crossover from diffusive to ballistic motion for fixed , non - zero values of planck s constant as the time becomes large . in section",
    "[ sec : qrw ] we discuss the connection between the multi - baker map and other models of quantum random walks .",
    "we conclude with a summary of results , and a discussion of the possible implications and extensions of this work .",
    "we begin with the classical multi - baker map  @xcite .",
    "it is a two - dimensional lattice system where the phase space at each lattice site is a square and the dynamics is a combination of transport of the phase space densities to neighboring cells , which models the free flight , followed by a local baker map evolution within a square , which models a collision with a fixed scatterer .",
    "that is , the multi - baker map , @xmath8 , is a composition of two maps @xmath9 : transport , @xmath10 , of phase points to neighboring cells , given by @xmath11{ll }        ( n+1 , x , y ) , & \\quad { \\rm for } \\ ; 0 \\leq x < 1/2 , \\\\        ( n-1 , x , y ) , & \\quad { \\rm for } \\ ; 1/2 \\leq x < 1 ,      \\end{array }    \\right.\\ ] ] and the baker map , @xmath12 , which acts on the @xmath13 coordinates of each cell , @xmath14 , separately , according to @xmath15{ll }        ( n , 2x , y/2 ) ,          & \\quad { \\rm for } \\ ; 0 \\leq x < 1/2 , \\\\",

    "{ \\rm for}\\ ; 1/2 \\leq x < 1 .      \\end{array }    \\right.\\ ] ] as mentioned above , this classical map represents a simple area - preserving model of simple random walk .",
    "it can also be considered a simplified bernoulli map for the motion of light weakly interacting particles in a gas of heavy scatterers on regular lattice ( periodic lorentz gas ) .",
    "the quantization of the multi - baker map is based upon the known quantization of the baker map on the unit square , carried out by balazs and voros , and by saraceno  @xcite .",
    "we form the quantum multi - baker by transporting some of the quantum states to the next cell on the right and the others to the next cell on the left , based upon the way the transformed points are moved to neighboring cells in the classical multi - baker , and then model the scattering by the quantum baker map @xmath12 acting in every single cell .    to quantize the baker map , we regard the horizontal direction of the torus @xmath17 as the position axis , while vertical axis corresponds to the momentum direction . to obtain the hilbert space we take the subspace of the wave functions on a line",
    "whose probability densities , @xmath18 are periodic in both position and momentum representations , respectively : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 are phases parameterizing quantization . the quantization of the baker map requires the phase space volume to be an integer multiple of the quantum of action  @xcite .",
    "therefore the effective planck constant is @xmath22 , for a baker map on a unit torus , where @xmath23 , an integer , is the dimension of the hilbert space .",
    "the space and momentum representations are connected by a discrete fourier transform @xmath24_{k , l } : = { n}^{-1/2 } \\exp(-i 2\\pi n p_k q_l)$ ] .",
    "the discrete positions and momenta are @xmath25 , @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "we take @xmath23 to be an even integer and label the quantum states in coordinate space by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 .",
    "the states @xmath29 are called the `` left '' states , with collective wave function , @xmath30 , while the remaining states , @xmath31 are called the `` right '' states , with wave function , @xmath32 .",
    "one may think of @xmath33 as @xmath34 component vectors .",
    "having constructed the hilbert space , one looks for a family of unitary propagators parameterized by @xmath35 which approach the classical map in semi - classical limit .",
    "the quantum baker map  @xcite is then given by a combination of two operations .",
    "the first operation takes the @xmath34 `` left '' states into momentum states labeled @xmath36 , called `` bottom '' momentum states , by means of the @xmath37 fourier transform matrix @xmath38 .",
    "the `` right '' coordinate states are transformed to `` top '' momentum states in the same way .",
    "now one has transformed @xmath23 spatial states into @xmath23 momentum states in a way that mimics the classical baker s map .",
    "the final step is to express the @xmath23 new states in coordinate representation by means of the @xmath39 matrix , @xmath40 , which takes @xmath23 states in the momentum representation to their coordinate representation . the full baker transformation , @xmath41 , on the torus is then given by the unitary transformation @xmath42{cc }      g_{n/2 } & 0 \\\\ 0 & g_{n/2 }    \\end{array } \\right ] \\label{bm}\\ ] ] for even @xmath23 .",
    "other examples and discussions of issues concerning the quantization of area - preserving maps can be found for instance in  @xcite .    using this transformation as a template we can easily express the quantum multi - baker map as a transformation of right and left quantum states in unit squares labeled by @xmath43 to right and left states in the unit square labeled by @xmath14 , @xmath44 .",
    "that is , in the position representation the evolution of the wave function in the quantum multi - baker is given by the equations @xmath45{c }",

    "we will consider the case where this matrix is independent of the cell index , so that the system of equations is translationally invariant from cell to cell .",
    "we restrict our attention here to finite systems of length @xmath48 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this condition induces bloch states and an eventual ballistic motion of particles through the chain .",
    "we associate @xmath48-dimensional hilbert space with the lattice , and since the internal space is @xmath49 , the hilbert space of the system is the tensor product @xmath50 .",
    "we will work with the basis defined by @xmath51 , where @xmath14 is the lattice site , @xmath52 denotes left / right half of the square , and @xmath53 denotes the state in given half in the position representation .",
    "since the states associated with the left half of the cell go one step to the right we write @xmath54 , accordingly @xmath55 .",
    "then the general wave function for the multi - baker chain can be written as @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 is orthogonal projection of the state vector onto the `` left '' or `` right '' subspace at site @xmath14 . thus the inner product takes form @xmath59 we may think of @xmath60 and @xmath61 as corresponding to @xmath34-component column and row vectors , respectively , while @xmath62 corresponds to an @xmath63-component vector .",
    "since we work mostly in position basis , we use @xmath34 dimensional vectors @xmath64 , whose @xmath65-th components are @xmath66 , where the index @xmath14 denotes the lattice site of the cell under consideration , as above , the notation @xmath52 denotes the particular half of the unit square under consideration , the left half indicated by @xmath67 moves to the cell to the right , and the right half , denoted by @xmath68 , moves to the cell to the left .",
    "the index @xmath65 denotes a particular quantum state in the right or left half of the unit cell , specified by @xmath52 and @xmath69 the action of the quantum multi - baker map on the total wave function will be written as the action of an operator @xmath70 defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : qmb ] ) , as @xmath71 the operator @xmath70 is the floquet operator for the multi - baker map and will be used to determine the time dependence of various observables for this system , as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is any observable of the system .",
    "the complete specification of the model requires values for the phases @xmath74 .",
    "there is a considerable amount of freedom for choosing these phases . as mentioned above",
    ", one may choose them to vary from cell to cell .",
    "a random variation of phases from cell to cell produces a _ disordered _ multi - baker map , while requiring that the phases have constant values throughout the lattice produces a _ regular , or uniform _ multi - baker map which is translationally invariant from one cell to the next .",
    "many other choices are possible and can be of interest . here",
    "we consider only the translationally invariant case . in numerical calculations",
    "we use the values for the phases chosen by balazs and voros  @xcite with @xmath75 ; those used by saraceno  @xcite @xmath76 , which lead to survival of additional classical symmetry in the model , as well as more generic values .",
    "we will see below that the saraceno phases lead to a non - generic behavior for the msd .",
    "let us consider now the structure of eigenstates of the unitary operator @xmath70 . since we consider periodic boundary conditions every eigenstate corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath77 has a bloch form @xmath78 where @xmath79{c }        \\tilde{\\psi}_+ \\\\",

    "we will enumerate the eigenstates of @xmath8 by @xmath84 , with @xmath85 .",
    "thus @xmath86 is the eigenstate given by the ansatz  ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) with @xmath87 , corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath88 , where phases @xmath89 are counted for a given @xmath90 from 0 ( including ) to @xmath91 , i.e. @xmath92 .",
    "in order to formulate our calculation of the msd for the uniform multi - baker map in the most convenient way , we introduce two operators , @xmath93 , which represent a coarse position operator and a coarse velocity operator , respectively .",
    "these operators are coarse in the sense that @xmath94 simply gives the lattice site associated with a particular quantum state , and the coarse grained velocity @xmath95 is given by @xmath96 .",
    "we argue elsewhere  @xcite , that for a translationally invariant system @xmath95 has a very simple form with values @xmath97 , given by the change in cell index for each quantum state .",
    "thus @xmath98 so that explicit expressions for the operators @xmath93 are @xmath99 suppose we prepare the system in a pure state @xmath62 .",
    "then the mean square displacement of the particle starting in this state is given by @xmath100 where @xmath101 .",
    "depending on the original state we have a distribution of possible results . to characterize it",
    "we can calculate its average over all the possible initial states , and the root mean square deviation from the average , which quantifies the spread of the results , or the quality of the prediction based on the average . in this section",
    "we find the expressions for both the equilibrium msd as well as for the equilibrium fluctuations of this function . in the next section",
    "we approximate the average results using random matrix theory , and then we compare them with numerical evaluation of the exact formulas .",
    "since the average over all the possible pure states gives the most incoherent mixture , we obtain a simple expression for the equilibrium msd as @xmath102 where @xmath103 @xmath48 is the length of the chain ( assume periodic boundary conditions ) , and @xmath23 is the dimension of the hilbert space for a single cell . clearly , @xmath104 is the equilibrium state for all the qmb , that is , it is time invariant @xmath105 and it maximizes the entropy @xmath106 .",
    "time invariance implies that the velocity autocorrelation function @xmath107 satisfies @xmath108 thus we can write @xmath109 this leads to a green - kubo like formula for the diffusion coefficient @xmath110 paralleling the classical case .",
    "however , here the diffusion coefficient turns out to be infinite .",
    "thus the msd is written as the sum of time correlations of the velocity , just as in the classical case , but the difference in mechanics will lead to important differences in the time development of the msd .    the translational invariance of the system , together with the uniform equilibrium density , imply that instead of summing over all the @xmath23 quantum states in the @xmath48 cells , we can sum only over the @xmath23 quantum states in one cell , see ref .",
    "thus we can write @xmath111 \\nonumber \\\\    & = & \\frac{1}{n } \\sum_{i,{\\varepsilon}=\\pm }    \\langle n= 0 , { \\varepsilon } , i| { { \\bf{m}}}^{\\dagger \\tau } v { { \\bf{m}}}^\\tau v   |n= 0 ,    { \\varepsilon } , i\\rangle \\nonumber \\\\    & = & \\frac{1}{n } \\sum_{i,{\\varepsilon}=\\pm } { \\varepsilon}\\langle n=0 , { \\varepsilon } , i| { { \\bf{m}}}^{\\dagger \\tau } v { { \\bf{m}}}^\\tau    |n= 0 ,    { \\varepsilon } , i\\rangle .   \\label{jrd5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus we have to sum , with appropriate signs , over all the possible cyclic paths starting in a fixed cell .",
    "the next simplification provided by the translational invariance of the model is that we can replace the unitary operator @xmath70 for the full multi - baker in eq .",
    "( [ jrd5 ] ) by the operator @xmath41 acting within a unit cell .",
    "this replacement follows from the observation that the velocity operator is diagonal in the representation based on the states in the cells , with a block structure that is identical from one cell to the next  .",
    "therefore , the velocity operator at time step @xmath0 takes on the same value in all of quantum states that are periodic images of any state in a fixed cell .",

    "we see that there is typically a ballistic contribution coming from diagonal and possibly some degenerate terms .",
    "the other contributions are oscillatory and usually negligible in the long time limit .",
    "it can happen , however , that the ballistic contribution disappears altogether and we have only oscillations which means that the particle is localized .",

    "these processes represent the effects of random external noise and result in some degree of decoherence  @xcite .",
    "further , in both quantum random walk models and multi - baker maps one can produce decoherence by replacing the unitary matrix describing the time evolution by a _ completely positive _ super - operator .",
    "this allows for both dissipation and decoherence .",
    "as this topic requires a separate discussion , we will not pursue it here , but leave the discussion of decoherence for further publications .",
    "this paper described calculations of important properties of the quantum multi - baker map , a simple model for transport in quantum systems . this map is the quantum version of a well known , classically chaotic system .",
    "in particular we were able to show , using random matrix theory , that it is possible to obtain an analytic expression for the equilibrium mean square displacement of a particle whose motion is governed by this quantum map .",
    "this expression is of particular importance for an understanding of transport in quantum systems because it allows us to carefully examine the particle s average motion both for finite times and for non - zero values of planck s constant .",
    "thus we can see how the two non - commuting limits , @xmath272 or @xmath273 , interact with each other .",
    "while our results are not surprising , in the sense that we already knew qualitatively the limiting forms , we did not have a general expression for the mean square displacement even for simple quantum systems before this work was carried out .",
    "moreover , the results from random matrix theory agreed very well with careful numerical evaluations of the mean square displacement for the multi - baker map .",
    "this agreement is also very important because random matrix theory does not really apply to any individual system , as far as one knows , but rather to the average behavior of an ensemble of similar systems .",
    "thus in the absence of a rigorous justification of the use of random matrix methods , their predictions must always be checked by comparisons with numerical studies .",
    "it will be interesting to find other signatures of classical behavior in the quantum multi - baker map that are more closely connected to the chaotic behavior of the classical map than the mean square displacement .",
    "for example , is there any trace of the classical , hyperbolic dynamical behavior in the quantum version of the map ?",
    "one prominent feature of the classical multi - baker model is the formation of fractal structures on arbitrarily fine scales as an initial non - equilibrium distribution of points relaxes to a final uniform equilibrium .",
    "this fractal structure can , in turn , be related to a positive entropy production typical of the approach to equilibrium of a macroscopic system .",
    "the quantum version of this phenomenon is largely unexplored and is of considerable interest to us .",
    "further work will also be devoted to exploring the consequences of the freedom one has in choosing phases of the unitary operators .",
    "this freedom allows us to consider random , quasi - random , and periodic systems , each with its own interesting physical properties .",
    "the quenched random system has been explored to some extent  @xcite , and provides a simple model of localization in one - dimensional disordered systems . here",
    "the classical limit is expected to be recovered through a phenomenon where the localization length grows infinitely large as planck s constant approaches zero , such that almost normal diffusion takes place within each localized region .",
    "this picture needs to be verified , and further systems still need to be explored .",
    "we also began to establish connections between this work on quantum multi - baker maps and a body of related work on quantum random walk processes .",
    "much of that literature is , in fact , devoted to the simplest multi - baker model , although this connection has not been recognized in the random walk literature .",
    "here we showed that the @xmath258 quantum multi - baker process is identical to the hadamard walk of random walk theory .",
    "although quantum computing is still far from being realized  @xcite , it is possible that the theory of quantum random walks may be of some value for constructing algorithms based on quantum walks that will be faster than current classical random walk algorithms  @xcite",
    ". future work will be devoted to expanding the connections between the quantum random walks and multi - baker processes for a variety of model systems .",
