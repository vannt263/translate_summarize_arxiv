    "multiferroic materials , which are simultaneously ( ferro)magnetic , ferroelectric and ferroelastic , have very interesting physical properties and promise important applications .",
    "they are presently attracting considerable attention [ 1 - 6 ] .",
    "there exist several different classes of multiferroics [ 5 ] , a very interesting type being the recently discovered [ 7 , 8 ] systems in which ferroelectricity appears only in certain magnetically ordered states , typically , although not necessarily , spiral ones [ 6 ] .",
    "even though their electric polarization @xmath8 is usually not large , one can easily influence it by comparatively weak magnetic fields .",
    "it is this magnetic `` switching '' of @xmath8 which makes multiferroics potentially very useful in device applications . at present",
    "relatively few such materials are known : some of them [ 7 - 11 ] are multiferroic in zero magnetic field , while others develop an electric polarization only if a magnetic field is applied [ 12 - 14 ] .",
    "these compounds belong to different crystallographic classes , and although some general rules governing their behaviour are already established [ 6 ] , there is as yet no complete or general understanding of the origin of multiferroic behaviour .    here",
    "we report the discovery and study of a new class of multiferroics , which opens a fresh possibility to investigate the systematics of this phenomenon .",
    "interestingly , this class  pyroxenes  form a very important group of minerals : they provide more than 20 vol.% of the earth s crust and upper mantle to a depth of 400 km [ 15 , 16 ] . in addition , with certain combinations of cations they create such well - known semiprecious stones as the famous chinese jade and they even are found as constituents of extraterrestrial materials such as lunar and martian rocks and meteorites [ 17 , 18 ] .",
    "pyroxenes belong to the silicates of the general composition @xmath0si@xmath1o@xmath2 where @xmath3 stands for mono- or divalent metals while @xmath4 represents di- or trivalent metals .",
    "their crystal structures possess orthorhombic or monoclinic symmetries which can accept a wide variety of @xmath4 and @xmath3 elements , especially the @xmath9-transition metals . in most cases si",
    "may be also substituted by ge .",
    "thus , pyroxenes offer a quite broad and flexible class of materials for physical investigations . until now",
    "detailed investigations of these systems have been mainly focused on mineralogical and crystallographic aspects .",
    "only recently did their magnetic properties attract some attention , in particular due to the observation of the orbitally - driven spin gap state in natisi@xmath1o@xmath2 [ 19 , 20 ] .",
    "most pyroxenes seem to be antiferromagnetic [ 21 ] , yet complete magnetic structures are only known for few members of this class .",
    "the specific features and the variety of magnetic properties of pyroxenes are determined by their crystal structure , shown in figure 1 .",
    "the main building blocks are one - dimensional zig - zag chains of edge - sharing [ @xmath4o@xmath2 ] octahedra running along the crystallographic @xmath11-axis . within the ( 110 ) and ( @xmath12 ) planes these chains are connected by chains of [ sio@xmath13 ( or [ geo@xmath13 ) tetrahedra .",
    "important here is that , besides the quasi - one - dimensionality of the [ @xmath4o@xmath2 ] chains , the relative packing of the magnetic chains forms a triangular - type magnetic lattice in each ( 110 ) plane , see figure 1c , giving rise to a magnetic frustration .",
    "a similar frustration is present in the ( @xmath12 ) plane .",
    "such geometric frustration can in principle lead to complex magnetic structures , in particular , commensurate or incommensurate spiral ordering , which , according to our present understanding , may be favourable for magnetically - induced ferroelectricity [ 6 ] .",
    "so based upon their crystal structure pyroxenes are excellent candidates for multiferroic behaviour .",
    "another beneficial feature of these materials is that they are usually good insulators ( transparent crystals of green , yellow or brown colour ) , which is important for ferroelectric materials .",
    "we find that indeed at least three members of this family , nafesi@xmath1o@xmath2 , lifesi@xmath1o@xmath2 and licrsi@xmath1o@xmath2 become ferroelectric in a magnetically ordered state . in all of them",
    "the ferroelectricity can be strongly modified by the application of magnetic fields along different crystallographic directions .     *",

    "the linkage between iron atoms of neighboring chains is visualized in the right part using the stick - and - ball representation .",
    "sodium atoms are left out for clarity .",
    "black lines denote the unit cell .",
    "the crystal structures of lifesi@xmath1o@xmath2 and licrsi@xmath1o@xmath2 are similar , but with space group symmetry @xmath14 [ 23 ] , while it is @xmath15 for nafesi@xmath1o@xmath2 . * ( c ) * schematic elements of the magnetic subsystem .",
    "the double green lines represent the intrachain exchange interaction @xmath16 arising from two equivalent fe  o  fe paths . despite the geometric zig - zag arrangement of the [ feo@xmath2 ] octahedra",
    ", one may expect for fe@xmath17 a uniform @xmath16 , since both the bond distances and the bond angles do not alternate along the chain direction and all @xmath9-orbitals of fe@xmath17 are half - filled .",

    "the chemical composition and homogeneity of our natural crystal of aegirine were analyzed by electron microprobe ( jeol 8900rl ) on a ( 001 ) plate yielding the compositional formula na@xmath22fe@xmath23ca@xmath24mn@xmath25al@xmath26ti@xmath27si@xmath28o@xmath29 .",
    "transparent single crystals of lifesi@xmath1o@xmath2 ( light green ) and licrsi@xmath1o@xmath2 ( emerald - green ) were grown from melt solution with dimensions reaching @xmath30  mm@xmath21 .    the magnetic susceptibility , pyroelectric current ( typical peak heights : 50  fa5  pa , typical baselines : 20400  fa with noise of order 10  fa ) and capacitance were measured by a vibrating sample magnetometer ( quantum design ppms ) , an electrometer ( keithley 6517a ) and a capacitance bridge ( andeen - hagerling 2500a ) , respectively . for the dielectric investigations plate - like samples coated with gold or silver electrodes",
    "were used .",
    "the dielectric constant @xmath31 was calculated from the measured capacitance .",
    "the pyroelectric current was recorded without applied electric field at a heating rate of @xmath32  k / min for nafesi@xmath1o@xmath2 and @xmath33  k / min for lifesi@xmath1o@xmath2 and licrsi@xmath1o@xmath2 after having cooled the sample in a static electric poling field of at least 200  v / mm .",
    "typical leakage currents caused by the poling field amount to about 50  fa , meaning that the resistivities of our crystals are larger than @xmath34 m . by reversing the poling field the pyroelectric origin of the measured current and the ferroelectric switching of polarization was established .",
    "the polarization was completely reversible in nafesi@xmath1o@xmath2 and in lifesi@xmath1o@xmath2 . in our small single crystals of licrsi@xmath1o@xmath2 the full reversal of pyrocurrent",
    "was not reached but only a reduction by @xmath35% , most probably due to the domain wall pinning .",
    "this feature has to be checked on larger crystals . for calculating the polarization @xmath8 by integration of the pyroelectric current , a non - polarization - caused baseline ( dependent on sample and measurement geometry )",
    "was eliminated .    for the band structure calculations we used the tight - binding linearized muffin - tin ( mt ) orbitals method and the lsda+u approximation , which takes into account the on - site coulomb correlations ( @xmath36 ) in a mean - field way .",
    "we utilized the values of the hubbard @xmath37  ev and hund s rule @xmath38  ev obtained by the same calculation scheme described in [ 24 ] .",

    "the measurements of @xmath45 resemble those for @xmath43 and are not shown .",
    "the inverse susceptibility @xmath46 taken in a field of 1  tesla is presented in figure 2b .",
    "the susceptibility data show nearly paramagnetic ( curie - weiss ) behaviour down to a temperature of about 50 k and the clear onset of antiferromagnetic ordering at 8 k. a negative weiss temperature @xmath47  k signals a net antiferromagnetic exchange interaction .",
    "the value of the effective magnetic moment @xmath48 amounts to 5.69@xmath49 close to the theoretically expected value of @xmath50@xmath49 for the spin - only value of the fe@xmath17 ( @xmath51 ) magnetic moments . while @xmath43 ( and @xmath45 ) for low magnetic fields exhibit a maximum indicating the antiferromagnetic order , only a kink is observed for @xmath44 .",
    "this is a strong indication , that ( at least for low magnetic fields ) the spins of the fe@xmath17-ions lie within the @xmath52-plane . by applying higher magnetic fields the transition temperature ( @xmath53 )",
    "is reduced and the anomaly strongly broadens until it is not resolvable anymore in a field of 8 tesla .",
    "another intriguing feature of the susceptibility data is an additional anomaly around 6  k. its position slightly decreases towards lower temperatures with increasing field and it vanishes for fields of more than about 4 tesla .",
    "as will be illustrated below , this behaviour is related to the onset of a spontaneous electrical polarization in nafesi@xmath1o@xmath2 .",

    "we recognize that nafesi@xmath1o@xmath2 becomes ferroelectric below @xmath62  k , with the polarization @xmath63 .",
    "the onset temperature @xmath64 and the magnitude of @xmath40 are suppressed by the field @xmath65 , but hardly change for @xmath66 .",
    "this is confirmed by a well - defined peak of the longitudinal component @xmath39 of the relative dielectric tensor along @xmath55 ( figure 2e ) , which is strongly suppressed by a magnetic field applied within the @xmath52-plane , but only weakly shifts to lower temperature for @xmath66 .",
    "this anisotropic magnetic - field dependence of the ferroelectric ordering fully corresponds to that of the magnetic ordering observed in the susceptibility measurements .",
    "when the polarization @xmath40 is suppressed by latexmath:[$\\mathbf{h }    @xmath41 appears instead . a similar polarization @xmath41 is also generated by @xmath60 .",
    "thus , a field @xmath59 applied within the @xmath52-plane leads to a gradual rotation of the polarization from @xmath55 to @xmath56 , see figure 2f , while a magnetic field applied along the @xmath68-direction does not create any measurable @xmath41 .",

    "the onset temperature gradually decreases to 14 k when increasing the magnetic field to 14  tesla .",
    "the strong low - temperature increase of @xmath45 around 6  tesla indicates a spin - flop transition , where the orientation of the spins changes from parallel @xmath56 to perpendicular @xmath56 .",

    ", we also observe small precursors of negative sign in the pyroelectric current .",
    "their origin is not yet clear , but they can not be attributed to ferroelectric behaviour , since  in contrast to the large peaks  they neither change sign nor shape or size when the electric poling field is reversed . with increasing magnetic field",

    "the pyroelectric current in finite and zero magnetic field reveals a clear development of a spontaneous electric polarization @xmath40 below the magnetic ordering temperature in finite magnetic fields .",
    "however , due to small negative pyroelectric currents in finite fields for temperatures below the peak , the calculated polarization decreases again and even changes sign with further decreasing temperature . whether or not this unexpected behaviour is intrinsic requires further studies on larger crystals .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility @xmath45 of licrsi@xmath1o@xmath2 ( figure 4c ) shows a different behaviour .",
    "around 20  k we observe a broad maximum of @xmath45 , as is typical for low - dimensional spin systems .",

    "the pyroelectric current and the resulting electric polarization of licrsi@xmath1o@xmath2 ( figure 4d ) show a sharp phase transition slightly below 11  k that coincides with the temperature of magnetic ordering .",
    "in contrast to lifesi@xmath1o@xmath2 we observe neither a shift of the onset temperatures of magnetic ordering nor of the electric polarization with increasing magnetic field .",
    "the magnitude of the electric polarization monotonically grows with increasing magnetic field up to the highest applied field of 8  tesla .",
    "according to the data presented above we identify at least three members of the large pyroxene family that develop magnetically - driven ferroelectricity , which strongly depends on the applied magnetic field .",
    "the ferroelectric behaviour was established by reversing the static electric poling field ( see section 2 ) .",
    "the explanation of the appearance of ferroelectricity in magnetic states requires the specific knowledge of the corresponding magnetic structure .",
    "the early data on the magnetic structure of nafesi@xmath1o@xmath2 are presented in [ 22 , 27 ] , and those for lifesi@xmath1o@xmath2 in [ 27 , 28 ] ( for licrsi@xmath1o@xmath2 no information on the magnetic structure is available in literature ) .",
    "the proposed structures , all being antiferromagnetic , are nevertheless different , even for the same material . in [ 22 ] it was suggested that in aegirine the spins of the one - dimensional zig - zag chains in the @xmath11-direction are ferromagnetic , with the neighbouring chains being antiparallel . in [ 27 ] the same magnetic coupling scheme , but also a model of purely antiferromagnetic coupling within and between the chains , was considered for both , nafesi@xmath1o@xmath2 and lifesi@xmath1o@xmath2 , based upon magnetization and mssbauer investigations . and in [ 28 ] the authors conclude that the spins are antiferromagnetically ordered both intrachain and interchain for lifesi@xmath1o@xmath2 , but the detailed magnetic structure was not revealed . at the same time",
    "several peaks in the neutron scattering spectra of nafesi@xmath1o@xmath2 observed in [ 22 ] remain unexplained , and the authors themselves speculate that they may be connected with a possible incommensurate superstructure caused by frustration . in the absence of unambiguous data on the magnetic structure we can only assume that there may indeed exist a spiral structure in these materials , possibly in addition to the main features found in [ 22 , 27 , 28 ] .",
    "actually , a spiral structure should be expected from the `` triangular '' topology seen in figure 1c and also from the values of the exchange constants .",
    "the latter were determined from _ ab - initio _ band structure calculations which we carried out using the lsda+u method ( see section  2 ) . for nafesi@xmath1o@xmath2 we obtained the intrachain exchange integral @xmath76",
    "k and the interchain coupling @xmath77  k ; @xmath78  k , and for lifesi@xmath1o@xmath2 @xmath79  k , @xmath80  k ; @xmath81  k  _ all antiferromagnetic _ , in full agreement with the goodenough - kanamori rules . for such values of exchange one expects a spiral magnetic structure for the triangular lattice [ 29 ] .    based upon our exchange scheme we can propose a scenario which would explain the appearance of ferroelectricity by the existence of spiral magnetic structures in nafesi@xmath1o@xmath2 ( and probably in lifesi@xmath1o@xmath2 and licrsi@xmath1o@xmath2 as well ) , consistent with the general considerations of [ 6 ]",
    ". however , we can not exclude other possible mechanisms , e.g.  magnetostriction [ 5 , 6 ] .",
    "the features of the observed polarization in all three materials , nafesi@xmath1o@xmath2 , lifesi@xmath1o@xmath2 and licrsi@xmath1o@xmath2 , indicate that the crystals remain monoclinic in their magnetically and electrically ordered phase , and therefore the phase transition follows the simplest group - subgroup path . in nafesi@xmath1o@xmath2",
    "the loss of inversion symmetry of the paraelectric phase ( point group @xmath82 ) at @xmath64 results in the polar point groups @xmath83 ( @xmath63 ) or @xmath84 ( @xmath8 perpendicular @xmath55 ) , depending upon the applied magnetic field .",
    "so far in the li - compounds spontaneous polarization was observed parallel @xmath55 in finite field , but it is not clear whether for @xmath85 the polarization is simply absent ( or very small ) , or along another direction . at present our available single crystals do not allow a definite conclusion .",
    "another open question is whether the presence of non - centrosymmetric [ sio@xmath13 tetrahedra plays some role in providing the mechanism of ferroelectricity in pyroxenes .",
    "we have found _ a new class of multiferroic materials _ among the geologically important pyroxenes with the general formula @xmath0si@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "so far , three members of this large family of compounds  nafesi@xmath1o@xmath2 , lifesi@xmath1o@xmath2 and licrsi@xmath1o@xmath2  show magnetically - induced ferroelectricity . both the magnitude and direction of the polarization can be strongly modified by a magnetic field . in the absence of reliable data on magnetic structure",
    "we can not exactly identify the source of multiferroic behaviour in the pyroxenes , but we suggest that its origin may be connected with a spiral magnetic structure caused by their magnetic frustration .",
    "the existence of many compounds with the pyroxene structure advances the hope that other materials of this large family would also display multiferroic behaviour at yet higher temperatures .",
    "the fact that this phenomenon is observed in materials that are very important in geology adds a new ingredient to our findings .",
    "one can only speculate whether the physics disclosed here may have important outgrowths for geophysics , e.g.  concerning cold extraterrestrial objects .",
    "however , even irrespective of this potentially important interplay , the very fact of the observation of a whole new class of ( nearly ) isostructural multiferroic materials has a substantial interest and should lead to a new and better understanding of this fascinating phenomenon .",
