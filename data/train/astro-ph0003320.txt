    "most of such galaxies at @xmath7 were discovered only recently ( e.g. steidel et al .",
    "@xcite ; dey et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and it seems that the majority of them are already rather evolved systems . moreover , the local candidate young galaxies are at least one order of magnitude less massive than the faintest candidate young galaxies at high redshifts , and represent the range of baryon mass ( 10@xmath310@xmath8 @xmath4 ) within which possibly most of primeval galaxies have formed ( e.g. rees @xcite ) .",
    "evidence for the existence of old low - mass stellar populations was obtained in the last 25 years for most of the studied bcgs ( thuan @xcite ; loose & thuan  @xcite ) . moreover ,",
    "no conclusive answer has been reached yet about the youth of the few most metal - poor bcg .",

    "the very blue colours of the disk , after correcting for the extinction in the galaxy ( @xmath48)@xmath73 = @xmath74 and ( @xmath49)@xmath73 = @xmath75 are reasonably consistent with the predictions for an instantaneous sf burst with a salpeter imf , a metallicity of 1/20 @xmath11 and an age of @xmath5 100 myr ( leitherer et al .",
    "if prolonged star formation is assumed , then the age of the oldest stellar population in the extended disc can be larger than that of the instantaneous burst .",
    "the observed colours can also be explained by continuous sf with a constant star formation rate from 500 myr to 20 myr ago .",
    "however , older stellar populations with an age of 10 gyr are excluded .",
    "the derived age is somewhat lower for the outermost part of the of the disc with a bluer ( @xmath49 ) colour in comparison to its average value .",
    "integrated colours of ionized gas are about ( @xmath76 ) = 0608 ( izotov et al .",
    "@xcite ) , what is redder than our observed values in the underlying disc . therefore",
    "if some gas emission inputs to the integrated disc colours , then the true colours of stellar component should be even bluer than measured .",
    "these colours are very similar to those of the underlying nebulosity in sbs  0335052 .",
    "the latter colours are shown to be well explained by the radiation of ionized gas and a - stars with the ages of no more than 100 myr , created in the current sf episode .",
    "this sf episode is prolonged and may represent a propagating sf wave ( papaderos et al .",
    "@xcite ) , similar to what is suggested for another candidate young galaxies i  zw  18 ( izotov et al .",
    "@xcite ) and cg  389 ( thuan et al .",
    "this similarity of lsb disc colours of hs  0822 + 3542 and sbs  0335052e suggests that up to the radial distances of @xmath5300 pc the input of stellar population with the ages larger than 100 myr to the disc radiation is undetectable .    as a first approximation",
    ", the colours of the underlying disc do not contradict the possibility that the current burst is the first sf episode in this galaxy .",
    "however since the emission of ionized gas can add significantly to the total radiation from the volume within 300400 pc , further photometric and spectroscopic observations of hs 0822 + 3542 are required to account properly for the contribution of gaseous emission .",
    "the star formation rate ( sfr ) of the current sf episode can be estimated from the total h@xmath23 luminosity .",
    "the h@xmath23 flux was measured within the slit , and was corrected for the missing light outside the slit .",
    "a correction factor of 2.33 was calculated , using the brightness profile along the slit and assuming circular symmetry . for the derived total flux @xmath77(h@xmath23)=5.8@xmath78erg  s@xmath17cm@xmath72",
    "we obtain a total h@xmath23 luminosity of 10@xmath80erg  s@xmath17 .",
    "this h@xmath23 luminosity corresponds to a current sfr of @xmath5 0.007 @xmath4 yr@xmath17 ( hunter & gallagher @xcite ) assuming a salpeter imf with a 0.1 @xmath4 lower mass cutoff .",
    "the gaseous mass converted into the stars during a 3 myr burst is @xmath5 2@xmath210@xmath81 @xmath4 .",
    "the unknown contribution of the gaseous emission to the light from the lsb component further complicates the stellar mass estimate .",
    "if only stars with age @xmath82 100 myr contribute to the lsb luminosity , then the total mass of stars in the underlying disc with @xmath83=123 is 1.3@xmath210@xmath84 @xmath4 ( from e.g. , leitherer et al .",
    "this is much smaller than the total neutral gas mass of @xmath13.0@xmath210@xmath85 @xmath4 , accounting for a helium mass fraction of 0.25 .",
    "the total mass of ionized gas can be obtained from the average mass density inside the hii region and its volume . an average mass density corresponding to the average electron density @xmath86 of 1 @xmath87 within a volume with a diameter of 0.5 kpc yields a total ionized gas mass of 10@xmath88 @xmath4 .",
    "the above estimates show that baryonic matter in hs 0822 + 3542 is dominated by the gaseous component .      the integrated hi line flux , the characteristic widths of 21 cm line profile @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( for a hanning smoothing of 10.6  km s@xmath17 ) , and the derived hi mass @xmath91 for hs  0822 + 3542 are presented in table  [ tab : main_par ] .",
    "the small hi mass 2.4@xmath92@xmath4 of this galaxy is consistent with its low optical luminosity .",
    "the very narrow hi profile is indicative of its very low amplitude of rotational velocity , which does not exceed 30  km s@xmath17 .",
    "it is difficult to assess the inclination angle correction , since the optical morphology can be unrelated to global properties of the associated hi cloud , as exemplified by the case of sbs  0335052 ( pustilnik et al .",
    "@xcite ) . the role of chaotic gas motions is , in general , more important in very low mass galaxies , where the amplitude of random velocities reaching ten km s@xmath17 or more can be commensurate with the rotational velocity .",
    "the measured hi mass and the profile width are in the range characteristic of very low mass galaxies .",
    "the mass - to - light parameter @xmath93(hi)/@xmath94 = 1.40 @xmath4/@xmath95 , is comparable to those of i  zw  18 and sbs  0335052e .",
    "it is not as high as in some gas - rich dwarfs from van zee et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , but these galaxies , although they have a few hii regions , are in relatively quiescent state .",
    "the extremely metal - poor bcgs discussed here experience significant luminosity enhancement due to very intense current and recent sf activity ; this results in a significant decrease of their mass - to - light ratios relative to their non - active state .",
    "a rough estimation can be made also on the dynamical mass of hs  0822 + 3542 . from the width of hi profile at the 20% level ,",
    "a maximum rotation velocity of 30  km s@xmath17 can be assumed .",
    "the extent of the hi cloud associated with a bcg is normally many times larger than its optical size .",
    "the optical radius @xmath96 is the radius of a disc galaxy at the isophotal level @xmath71 = 25.0 mag arcsec@xmath72 .",
    "a conservative lower limit to the ratio of hi - to - optical radii is 4 ( see , e.g. taylor et al .",
    "@xcite ; chengalur et al .",
    "@xcite ; salzer et al .",
    "@xcite ; van zee et al .",
    "@xcite ; pustilnik et al .",
    "@xcite ) . by equating gravitation and centrifugal force at the edge of hi disc an estimate of the dynamical mass inside 1.5 kpc",
    "is obtained ; this is 3.4@xmath210@xmath3 @xmath4 , one order of magnitude larger than the total visible mass of the galaxy @xmath97 + @xmath98 + @xmath99 .",
    "even rather unprobable case of hi radius equal to the optical one results in the total dynamical mass @xmath53 times higher than the visible mass .",
    "hence , hs  0822 + 3542 like other extremely metal - deficient dwarf galaxies , is dynamically dominated by a dark matter halo , supporting the modern view of primeval galaxy formation process ( e.g. rees @xcite ) . in turn the mass of its dm",
    "halo is one of the smallest for galaxies .",
    "the properties of hs  0822 + 3542 presented above ( extremely low abundance of heavy elements , very blue colour of underlying nebulosity , and extremely small mass ratio of stars to neutral gas ) suggest that this could be the nearest candidate young dwarf galaxy forming its first stellar generation . however , on the basis of the present data , we can not exclude the presence of an underlying older stellar populations originating from earlier sf episodes .",
    "similar studies of the two previously known young galaxy candidates i  zw  18 and the pair sbs  0335052e/0335052w ( izotov et al .",
    "@xcite ; thuan & izotov @xcite ; pustilnik et al .",
    "@xcite ; lipovetsky et al .",
    "@xcite ) have not been conclusive whether such young systems really do exist .",
    "while the chemical properties ( see table  [ t : chem ] ) of these candidates seem to follow a general trend and behave quite homogeneously , other global properties have still to be understood . from table  [ tab : main_par ]",
    "it appears that they cover a broad range of neutral hydrogen masses and blue luminosities ( a factor of @xmath5 4060 ) .",
    "the same is true for their current sfrs and for the mass of stars formed in a single star formation episode .",
    "we suggest that a simple linear scaling between several important parameters holds for forming galaxies , at least in the range of baryon masses of ( 0.320)@xmath210@xmath3 @xmath4 ( see table 1 , and assuming that most of baryons in these bcgs are in atomic hydrogen and helium ) .",
    "this is important both for the analysis of conditions capable of maintaining pristine gas clouds stable for @xmath5 a hubble time , and for the planning of further searches for such objects . in particular",
    ", such low - mass objects can represent a significant fraction of the ly@xmath23 absorbers at high redshifts .",
    "one more indirect argument for the possible youth of the three bcgs considered here comes from the calculations of mass and heavy elements loss in dwarfs with active sf ( mac low & ferrara @xcite ) .",
    "these show that the rate of metal loss is strongly dependent on the baryon mass in the range of 10@xmath100 to 10@xmath101 @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , if these extremely metal - poor galaxies with masses ranging from 3@xmath210@xmath100 to 2.5@xmath210@xmath101 @xmath4 were not in their first sf episode , we should expect significant differences in their observational properties .",
    "for the three bcgs discussed here we do not find these differences .    from the surface density of already known objects with extremely low metallicity and small radial velocity",
    "one can expect to find at least ten more such galaxies within 15 mpc , if the search will be extended to the entire sky .",
    "from the data and discussion above we reach the following conclusions :    1 .",
    "hs  0822 + 3542 is a new nearby ( @xmath102 = 12.5 mpc ) galaxy with oxygen abundance 12 + log(o / h ) = 7.35 .",
    "after i  zw  18 and sbs  0335052 this is the third lowest metallicity object among blue compact galaxies . 2 .",
    "its very low metallicity , very small stellar mass fraction ( 0.05 relative to the entire baryon mass ) and blue colours of the underlying disc [ ( @xmath48)@xmath73 = 005 , ( @xmath49)@xmath73 = 026 ] imply that this is one of the few candidates to be a local young galaxy , forming its first generation of stars .",
    "3 .   hs  0822 + 3542 is 5060 times less luminous and massive than another candidate young galaxy sbs  0335052 .",
    "this implies a broad range of global parameters for the candidate young galaxies .",
    "a linear scaling between several important parameters of such galaxies probably exists , including parameters related to the sf burst .",
    "the dynamical mass estimate using the width of the hi profile and a typical hi gas extent relative to the optical size , leads to the conclusion that hs  0822 + 3542 is dynamically dominated by a dark matter halo .",
    "higher s / n long - slit spectra than presented here , and deep h@xmath23 images are needed to follow the ionized gas extent .",
