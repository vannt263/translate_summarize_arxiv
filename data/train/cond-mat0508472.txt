    "both the self - consistent ornstein - zernike approximation ( scoza , @xcite ) and the hierarchical reference theory ( hrt , @xcite ) have been found to give very accurate results for fluids in thermal equilibrium .",
    "in particular , the respective non - linear parabolic partial differential equations ( pdes ) remain practical in the critical region , and their solution gives non - classical , and partly ising - like , critical indices .",
    "the pdesthemselves are derived by obtaining the equation of state in two independent ways and using thermodynamic consistency to fix a free parameter in the direct correlation function .",
    "although both approaches thus appear similar in a number of aspects , there are also marked differences : while both make use of the compressibility route to thermodynamics , scoza  combines it with the energy route expression for the _ internal _ energy , whereas hrt , inspired by momentum - space renormalization group theory , relies on what might be called the fluctuation route to the _ free _ energy instead .",
    "in addition to the density @xmath1 , the independent variables in the pdes  are therefore the inverse temperature @xmath2 and the momentum - space cutoff @xmath3 , respectively . starting from a reference system of known properties at vanishing @xmath4 or at high @xmath3 ,",
    "the attractive interaction is then turned on by gradually increasing its strength @xmath4 ( scoza ) , or by including its fourier component of wavenumber @xmath3 at constant temperature until the full system is recovered in the limit @xmath5 .    in the present contribution",
    "we want to investigate the possibility of combining both approaches by imposing thermodynamic consistency of the internal and free energies to obtain a differential formulation where both the strength of the interaction and its fourier components are added successively .",
    "this introduces an additional constraint so that a further free parameter in the closure relation can be determined .",
    "in combination with the compressibility route there are then two free parameters that may be used , _",
    "e.  g. _ , to describe both the range and the amplitude of a contribution to the direct correlation function @xmath6 ; it might then be possible to describe the long - ranged tail that @xmath6 is known to develop in the critical region . however , our preliminary investigations point to several difficulties with this approach near phase coexistence .",
    "the crucial problem is the vastly different behavior of hrt  and scoza  in this part of the phase diagram : hrthas a solution at all densities , but spinodal and binodal coincide so that the two phases coexist at infinite compressibility ; scoza , on the other hand , gives distinct binodal and spinodal curves but does not have a solution inside the spinodal . at this point",
    "it is unclear how these differences might be resolved by a simple modification of the direct correlation function .",
    "even at temperatures above the critical one , @xmath7 , where full self - consistency should be attainable , we will be confronted with differential equations that are of first order in temperature and cutoff and of second order in the density .",
    "numerical solution of such a pde  can be demanding .    to simplify our task and gain some insight we here consider a simplified lattice gas model , and we limit ourselves to combining the energy and fluctuation routes without using the compressibility at all .",
    "then there is only one free parameter left that can be determined as a function of @xmath4 and @xmath3 . after introducing our model and establishing the pde  ( section  [ sec : model ] ) , we show that consistency is achieved with the mean spherical approximation ( msa ) and several generalizations of it ( section  [ sec : msa ] ) .",
    "the solution can therefore be given in closed analytic form , but the price to pay for omission of the compressibility is the presence of the msa  features , _ viz .",
    "_ , `` irregular '' isotherms in the critical region and lack of a well - defined critical behavior for the lattice gas case @xcite .    in general , an analytical solution is also unlikely to be known beforehand if other closures are used . in that case",
    "one should seek the solution numerically by integrating the equations for the characteristic curves of the pde .",
    "especially when the compressibility relation not considered here is incorporated , a numerical solution will be required , and we expect the properties of the characteristics analyzed here to be useful more generally . after establishing relations and implications for more general situations",
    "( section  [ sec : char : general ] ) we once more turn to the msaequations . it is found that the pde  admits a more general solution . usually , the reference system also does not determine the solution at @xmath8 for finite temperature due to the behavior of the characteristics ( section  [ sec : char : msa ] ) . a generalized version of the pde  that does not make any assumptions on the form of the direct correlation function of the system at cutoff @xmath3 and inverse temperature @xmath4 other than that it depends on some unknown parameter function @xmath9 is considered in section  [ sec : char : oz ] .",
    "it is then found that these deficiencies can be peculiar to the specific closure employed .",
    "based on these findings , we finally state and consider two complementary necessary conditions a parameterization of the solution must fulfill for the consistency problem to be well posed and physically reasonable ( section  [ sec : conditions ] ) .",
    "these conditions have the advantage that they can be checked in the high temperature limit where significant simplifications are possible .",
    "they are also sufficiently general to apply to more realistic model systems , both discrete and continuous . in view of the relation between the properties of a non - linear diffusion equation with two time - like parameters on the one hand  and the first - order pde  we consider in the present contribution on the other hand ,",
    "the criteria found for the selection of suitable closure relations remain relevant even when the compressibility route to thermodynamics is also taken into account .",
    "in the interest of simplicity , we here consider only a lattice gas ( or ising model ) .",
    "the main advantage of this choice is that the core condition of vanishing pair distribution function @xmath10 affects only the single point at @xmath11 .",
    "in addition , we assume a sufficiently long - ranged interaction so that the anisotropy imposed by the lattice structure can be neglected . besides , an even more long - ranged tail appears in the interaction for intermediate @xmath3 , _ _ cf.__@xcite and appendix  d.1 of @xcite .",
    "when following the hrtrecipe of successively including fourier components of the interaction , we will therefore do so without regard to the geometry of the brillouin zone . in the same spirit",
    "we will often speak of finite or infinite cutoffs and wavenumbers instead of specifying the corresponding surfaces within the brillouin zone explicitly @xcite , and we will also write @xmath12 for the maximum cutoff in the calculation . it is not expected that these simplifications should affect the results qualitatively . furthermore , the main conclusions of section  [ sec : conditions ] are manifestly independent of these assumptions .    the system is assumed to differ by a perturbing attractive interaction @xmath13 , @xmath14 , from a reference system of known properties . in the lattice case the simple hard core lattice gas can serve as the reference system .",
    "we can then use the inverse range @xmath0 of the attractive interaction as a perturbing parameter @xcite .",
    "the zeroth order contribution past the reference system is the mean - field attractive van der waals term , corresponding to a pressure contribution of @xmath15 , where a tilde indicates fourier transformed quantities . in hrt",

    "this corresponds to the infinite sum of one - loop diagrams @xcite .",
    "the interaction @xmath29 may also have a narrow peak of width @xmath0 at some other position , say , around @xmath31 . in @xmath32 space",
    "this corresponds to an infinitely weak but oscillating interaction with wave vector @xmath3 , and eq .",
    "( [ hemmer : i ] ) is still exact in the limit @xmath28 . on the other hand , the renormalization procedure of hrt",

    "( [ hrt:1 ] ) is then formally exact , but it does not specify how @xmath40 changes as fourier components of @xmath33 are added and the cutoff @xmath3 approaches zero . the formal answer to this problem",

    "the disadvantage of this approach is that it leads to highly involved expressions",
    ".    a simpler way of obtaining the characteristic equations is by cross differentiation of the pde : setting @xmath104 gives @xmath105 this is a quasi - linear first - order pde  for @xmath97 of the form @xmath106 , for which the characteristic equations are @xmath107 . in combination with the pde  for @xmath100 itself",
    "we immediately find the set of characteristic equations , @xmath108 at every point @xmath109 along a characteristic the ratios of these differentials determine the direction of its tangent in the @xmath109 plane as well as the corresponding changes in @xmath97 , @xmath110 , @xmath103 , and @xmath100 along the curve .",

    "an important consequence of the equations given above concerns the orientation of the characteristics in the @xmath116 plane at special points : evidently , wherever @xmath117 and @xmath118 , the tangent is parallel to the @xmath98 axis , _",
    "i.  e. _ , @xmath119 . by locating the zeros of the @xmath97 derivatives of the right hand sides of the pde  we can",

    "the path of integration in the @xmath120 plane , pure hrt  obviously corresponds to characteristics at constant temperature , and pure scoza  to those at constant cutoff .",
    "we will therefore refer to these directions as hrt - like or scoza - like , respectively .    for the pde  ( [ di : pde : msa ] ) , this directly implies the presence of a scoza - like characteristic for @xmath68 and of an hrt - like one at @xmath67 ; together they cover that part of the domain where the solution corresponds to the reference system .",

    "it is worth stressing that the significance of the characteristic curves extends not only to the numerics : in addition to the significance of shocks and rarefactions , neither of which are expected in the present setting , the pde  is well - posed only when the characteristics establish a one - to - one mapping from the points at @xmath8 to a subset of the boundary where the solution and its first derivatives are known .",

    "the special significance of these characteristics comes from the fact that the solution for the target system ( @xmath8 ) is determined by a boundary condition only when both lie in the same sector as constancy of the @xmath82 is built right into eqs .",
    "( [ general : i ] ) and  ( [ general : def : khalf : mue ] ) .",
    "it is then possible to use a boundary condition to determine the @xmath82 in one sector , and to use their values in another one . ] .",
    "furthermore , the scoza - like orientation of a sectoral means that the solution along it can not depend on fourier components of the interaction at other @xmath3 in the high temperature limit .    for lower temperature",
    "we have to use the full solution . according to eq .",
    "( [ z : pde : char : j ] ) , the sectorals are the curves where @xmath148 . as we further follow along them , their direction will no longer be scoza - like , and the solution along them will depend on a range of fourier components .",
    "still , one of the properties that can be inferred from the temperature dependence of the @xmath70 integral is that no sectoral can ever get to @xmath8 at non - zero @xmath4 since @xmath157 there .",
    "this feature of the sectorals also conforms to our expectation for a realistic closure relation . for suppose that some sectoral starts at @xmath67 and intermediate @xmath158 and finally reaches @xmath8 at @xmath159 .",
    "clearly it can only cover a finite @xmath3 interval so that the solution at @xmath8 , @xmath160 can not depend on fourier components of the interaction outside this @xmath3 range .",
    "absence of crossings of characteristics immediately implies that the same is also true for the properties of the target system at all @xmath161 .",
    "this situation is clearly unacceptable except for @xmath162 .",
    "another consequence of the temperature dependence of the @xmath70 integral is the absence of sectorals at given @xmath3 for @xmath4 above some @xmath3-dependent limit ; this limit is generally higher for larger @xmath3 .",
    "there are then only a few classes of admissible configurations of the characteristics in the @xmath120 plane .",
    "most likely , the sectorals are either driven towards infinite @xmath4 at ever higher @xmath3 , or pairs of neighbouring sectorals join at their shared maximum @xmath4 and so form loops ; in the latter case , the maximum @xmath4 occurs at a cutoff where @xmath121 .",
    "unfortunately , both of these possibilities are highly problematic : if sectorals stay separate but go towards infinite @xmath4 and @xmath3 , there can be no finite temperature characteristic connecting a point close to the reference boundary with one at @xmath8 , @xmath124 .",
    "if , on the other hand , sectorals form loops , the same problem will arise at high cutoff .",
    "in addition , loops demarcate regions that are not entered by characteristics , implying rarefactions for @xmath48 .",
    "the properties of the characteristics just inferred for the msa  case studied here are certainly unexpected and disappointing because they do not allow us to go from the reference system at @xmath68 to the target system at vanishing @xmath3 .",
    "we now show that this is not so much a general defect of the combination of the energy and fluctuation routes but a consequence of the specific parameterization of the consistency problem . to see this ,",
    "let us consider an arbitrary closure relation to the ornstein - zernike relation  ( [ oz ] ) , giving the correlation functions @xmath163 and @xmath164 for any combination of @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and some unknown parameter @xmath9 .",
    "for example , the msa  case considered so far corresponds to the direct correlation function @xmath165 another simple possibility is @xmath166 this is suggested by the usual hrt  recipe for the continuum case when the core condition is not explicitly taken into account @xcite .    in this more general situation with unspecified closure",
    "the correct pde  is given by the earlier relations  ( [ hrt:1 ] ) and  ( [ u1:didbeta ] ) , except that the energy integral must be restricted to @xmath75 and that @xmath40 now depends not only on @xmath84 , @xmath4 and @xmath3 but also on the free parameter function @xmath9 . as noted in section  [ sec : model : lg ] , the core condition must be fulfilled at every @xmath3 if the simple expression  ( [ u1:didbeta ] ) is used , or else there will be an unphysical contribution to the internal energy from @xmath50 .    in general , @xmath49 is continuous at @xmath31 whereas the direct correlation function @xmath167 of the system corresponding to cutoff @xmath3 has a discontinuity of height @xmath168 there .",
    "the relation between @xmath40 and @xmath169 is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ h:1stordergamma ] ) by restricting the interaction to @xmath56 again , @xmath170 or @xmath171 without further specifying the closure , a number of properties of the characteristics can easily be deduced : as the unknown parameter @xmath97 enters eq .",
    "( [ di : pde : msa ] ) only through @xmath169 , we immediately see that the hrt - like characteristic at @xmath67 , the scoza - like characteristic at @xmath68 , and the hrt - like direction of the tangents of all characteristics whenever @xmath121 remain in this general setting .    both for discrete and continuous systems",
    "the question is then whether these boundary conditions at large but finite cutoff determine the solution at @xmath8 .",
    "we have just seen that this is usually not the case for the pde  ( [ di : pde : msa ] ) .",
    "as pointed out before , the boundary conditions must be imposed in the same sector where the target system s properties are to be recovered . for this to be possible and the reference system to provide a valid initial condition for the integration of the characteristic equations , it is necessary but not sufficient that there be no sectorals above the initial value of @xmath3 , nor between the boundary condition and the target system .",
    "we then have to consider the existence and distribution of sectorals once again , which crucially depends on the precise way in which the free parameter enters the equations . as an example , let @xmath172 and @xmath173 be the direct and total correlation functions for any solution of the pde  such as , _",
    "e.  g. _ , any of those presented in section  [ sec : msa ] .",
    "inserting either of the two sample closures @xmath174 and @xmath175 ( with largely arbitrary functions @xmath176 ) into eqs .",
    "( [ hrt:1 ] ) and  ( [ u1:didbeta ] ) yields a pde  for @xmath9 .",
    "obviously , the solution is @xmath177 for all @xmath4 and @xmath3 in either case so that the original solution is reproduced , @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ general : char ] ) , however , for eq .",
    "( [ char : artifical : hrt ] ) the characteristics are hrt - like everywhere ( @xmath180 , so that there are no sectorals at all ) , whereas they are all scoza - like everywhere for eq .",
    "( [ char : artifical : scoza ] ) ( @xmath181 , so that there are infinitely many sectorals ) .",
    "artificial and impractical as these examples are , they demonstrate that two different parameterizations of one and the same solution may have vastly different consequences , and eq .",
    "( [ char : artifical : hrt ] ) in particular shows the potential for a closure free of sectorals .",
    "we therefore conclude that the difficulties encountered in the case studied in section  [ sec : char : msa ] are not inherent in the consistency problem but merely a consequence of the particular msa - like closure used .",
    "the results of our investigation thus leave open the possibility of a practical scheme , drawing our attention to the precise parameterization of the solution .    while formulation of practical closure relations to be used together with eq .",
    "( [ di : pde : msa ] ) lies outside the scope of the present contribution , we can give two general non - trivial conditions an ansatz for @xmath169 must fulfill for the consistency problem to be well - posed and for a unique and differentiable solution to exist at all @xmath65 , @xmath64 : ( 1 )  there must not be any sectorals in the sense of the definition given in section  [ sec : char : oz ] ; and ( 2 )  any characteristic passing through a state with @xmath182 at some @xmath183 must remain at a strictly positive inverse temperature @xmath4 of order @xmath184 at lower cutoffs . while the former is quite obvious in the light of section  [ sec : char : msa : interp ]",
    ", the second condition has not featured prominently so far : it merely expresses the absence of rarefactions and shocks at infinite temperature , and for the msa  case as treated here these already imply sectorals , _ _",
    "cf.__section  [ sec : char : msa : interp ] .",
    "both of these criteria share the advantage of involving only the limit @xmath48 .",
    "they can therefore be checked by low order expansions in @xmath4 , which vastly simplifies analysis of the suitability of some specific closure relation in the context of eq .",
    "( [ di : pde : msa ] ) .",
    "another important property is that both of them are quite general : not only do they apply to discrete and continuous systems equally , they are also independent of the particular simplifications we chose to make in the present contribution . in particular , a closure may give a solution where the core condition is violated , leading to a spurious contribution to the energy integral of eq .",
    "( [ u1:didbeta ] ) . in this case",
    "more care should be exercised when evaluating the internal energy , leading to a modification of the pde  @xcite .",
    "the two conditions set out above , however , remain equally valid nevertheless .",
    "a careful study of the characteristics , especially of their compliance with the criteria just set out , is thus of vital importance for the consistency problem involving the energy and fluctuation routes only .",
    "the results of such an analysis are also highly relevant when the compressibility route enters the picture . for suppose that @xmath185 is the solution of the more elaborate pde  so obtained . by evaluating @xmath186 and inserting this into the compressibility sum rule used in both pure hrt  and pure scoza we arrive at a constraint involving both of the two unknown parameters in the parameterization of the solution at any @xmath187 .",
    "restriction to fixed density in the spirit of the line method then again leads to a problem of the type considered here , and the properties of the characteristics of this restricted problem must be taken into account when solving , or discretizing , the pde .",
    "in particular , the density dependence of the directions of the characteristics in the @xmath120 plane are then of prime importance for the numerical tractability of the pde  by finite difference methods . at this point , however , it is not clear how to handle the situation where @xmath4 does not increase monotonously along the characteristics , nor do we know whether that case actually occurs with physically plausible closure relations and interactions .",
    "in summary , in the present contribution we have introduced and started to tackle the problem of unifying scoza  and hrt , pointing out the importance of the condition of consistency between free and internal energies and for the time being setting aside consistency with the isothermal compressibility .",
    "a simplified lattice model system allowed us to derive a suitable pde  and to study its known analytical solutions of msa  type .",
    "in general , however , we can not assume an analytical solution to be available , and we therefore then turned to the problem of solving the pde  without previous knowledge of the exact solution , especially with a view towards a numerical implementation : this highlighted the importance of the characteristic curves of the pde , and we have studied some of their properties and consequences .",
