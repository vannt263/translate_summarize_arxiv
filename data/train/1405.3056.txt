    "the detection of b - mode from cmb by the bicep2 group @xcite has indicated a strong evidence of inflation @xcite . according to the results of bicep2 , the tensor - to - scalar ratio is constrained to @xmath5 at @xmath6 cl for the lensed-@xmath0cdm model , with @xmath7 disfavoured at @xmath8 level . with the help of this new constant on @xmath9 as well as that on the spectral index , some inflation models with prediction of negligible tensor perturbation have been excluded , such as the small - field inflation models .    in a simplest slow - roll inflation model ,",
    "the early universe was driven by a scalar field called the inflaton . to achieve an successful inflation",
    ", the potential of the inflaton field should be very flat .",
    "the most economical and fundamental candidate for the inflaton is the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson , which has been already observed by the collider experiment lhc in 2012 @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "higgs inflation is a simple and elegant model .",
    "however , to realize an inflation model by the higgs boson is not easy to predict correct density perturbations . to see this",
    ", one could simply estimate the mass of the inflaton from the the amplitude of the scalar perturbation power spectrum : @xmath10 gev . which is many orders of magnitude larger than the observed higgs mass , @xmath11 gev .",
    "in other words , the potential of higgs field @xmath12 is not flat enough to realize an inflation .    by introducing a non - minimal coupling to the gravity ( @xmath13 ) , one could indeed achieve such a flat potential after a conformal transformation @xcite .",
    "but this model can not accommodate the new measurement from bicep2 , since it generally predicts a small amplitude of tensor perturbations , see ref.@xcite .",
    "some other alternative higgs inflation models are summarised in ref.@xcite and the references therein . among these models",
    ", there is a very interesting higgs inflation model called the higgs chaotic inflation proposed in ref.@xcite . in this model , the quadratic chaotic inflation model",
    "could be realized by the sm higgs boson based on the so - called running kinetic inflation @xcite .",
    "we will give a very brief review on this model in the next section .",
    "recently , it is found that the cosmological constant plays an important role during the inflation time @xcite .",
    "not only the tensor - to - scalar ratio could be enhanced with the help of the cosmological constant , but also the number of e - folds could be large enough to overcome the problems in the big bang cosmology .    however , there are still two problems left .",
    "one is the famous cosmological constant fine - tuning problem , which states why the cosmological constant observed today is so much smaller than the planck scale , since the effective field theory still valid near this high energy scale . by using the observational value of the hubble constant  @xcite : @xmath14gev with @xmath15 , and the value of the energy density parameter of the cosmological constant @xcite : @xmath16",
    ", one can estimate that @xmath17 .",
    "this is equivalent to ask why the universe is accelerating at present . to explain this later time acceleration",
    ", people usually introduce an exotic energy component with negative pressure called the dark energy @xcite , but so far as we known , we have not find it in the laboratory yet .",
    "the other problem is that there is a tension between the observational results from bicep2 and the report of _",
    "planck_. according to the recent works from _ planck _",
    "@xcite , it gives @xmath18 and @xmath19 at @xmath20cl by combination of _ _ planck__+wp+highl data .",
    "however , when the running parameter defined as @xmath21 is included in the data fitting , it gives @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 at @xmath20cl by the same data . in a word , to give a consistent constraint on @xmath9 for the combination of _ _ planck__+wp+highl data and the bicep2 data , we require a large running of the spectral index .    in history , the cosmological constant",
    "was first introduced by einstein in his field equation as follows @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the ricci tensor and the scalar curvature respectively , while @xmath28 is the energy - momentum tensor of matters . using the bianchi identities and assuming the energy - momentum tensor satisfies the conservation law @xmath29 , it follows that the covariant divergence of @xmath30 must vanish also , and hence that @xmath31 const .",
    "however , if we move the cosmological term @xmath30 to the right - hand side of eq.([equ : ein ] ) , and to interpret @xmath0 as part of the matter content of the universe with total energy - momentum tensor @xmath32 .",
    "hereafter we set the unit @xmath33 for convenience .",
    "once this is done , there are no a prior reasons why @xmath0 should not vary , as long as the total energy - momentum tensor satisfies the conservation law : @xmath34 . for a wonderful review on the variable cosmological constant , see ref.@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will also assume that @xmath0 is no longer a constant during the inflation time , which means there exits an energy transfer between @xmath35 and the inflaton field , see sec.[sec : main ] .",
    "and we find that the cosmological constant fine - tuning problem is solved with the help of inflation , while a large running of the spectral index is obtained with the help of the cosmological constant . in the following , we still call @xmath35 the cosmological constant for the sake of historical convention , but one should keep in mind that @xmath35 is time - dependent now .",
    "the running kinetic inflation can be easily implemented in supergravity by assuming a shift symmetry exhibiting itself in the khler potential at high energy scales , while this symmetry is explicitly broken and therefore becomes much less prominent at low energy scales . in the unitary gauge",
    ", one can write down the lagrangian for the higgs boson @xmath12 @xcite : @xmath36 the effect of non - canonical kinetic term is significant for large @xmath37 .",
    "the kinetic term grows as @xmath38 , that is why the name `` running kinetic inflation '' . by redefining the higgs field",
    ", one can rewrite the lagrangian in terms of canonically normalized field @xmath39 with the effective potential @xmath40 thus , the quadratic chaotic inflation occurs .",
    "during inflation , the spatially flat universe could be described by the friedmann equation @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the energy density of the inflaton , which is dominated by its potential energy , while @xmath43 in the unit of @xmath44 .",
    "furthermore , by using the slow - roll approximation , the friedmann equation could be approximated as @xmath45 also , the conservation law @xmath34 gives @xmath46 with the pressure density of inflaton field , @xmath47 .",
    "notice that the time evolution of @xmath48 and @xmath49 is coupled in eq.([equ : con ] ) , and there is an energy transfer between the inflaton and @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , we have @xmath50 during inflation time . then according to conservation law ( [ equ : con ] )",
    ", it follows that @xmath51 , which means the energy could be transformed from @xmath0 to @xmath49 if @xmath52 . in other words",
    ", there exists an interaction between @xmath0 and the inflaton field , which causes the transfer of energy but keeps the total energy density unchanged , since @xmath53 .    the simplest term in the lagrangian that describing the interaction between the two components might be @xmath54 , which is analogous to the particle - fluid interactions that often emerged in the particle physics .",
    "hence , the conservation law becomes @xmath55 with the coupling term @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a dimensionless constant . here",
    "one can see that , the interaction term @xmath58 as long as the inflaton has non - vanishsed kinetic energy @xmath59 , and @xmath60 would be almost vanished when @xmath0 becomes extremely small . by inserting the explicit form of @xmath49 into eq.([equ : eom1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath61 and in the slow - roll limit , it becomes @xmath62 thus , we have a positive interaction term @xmath63 , which means that the energy density of the cosmological constant @xmath48 is decreasing while that of the inflaton @xmath49 is increasing .    from eq.([equ : eom2 ] ) , we have @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , we obtain @xmath65 } \\approx \\lambda\\exp{\\bigg(- \\alpha \\phi \\bigg ) } \\,,\\ ] ] where the subscript @xmath66 denoted the values at the end of inflaton . it should be noticed that eq.([equ : cc ] ) is very important to explain why the cosmological constant is so small at present universe with the help of inflaton field @xmath67 . in the following",
    ", one can see that @xmath68 could be indeed as the same order of magnitude as its present value , namely , @xmath69 , which is extremely small .",
    "then the interaction term in eq.([equ : q1 ] ) is almost vanished , @xmath70 or @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , @xmath68 becomes a constant after inflation , and it will cause a second accelerating at later time that has been confirmed by the supernovae observations",
    ".    on the other hand , with the help of @xmath0 and the coupling between the inflation and itself , the inflation model could predict a large tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath72 and a large running of the spectral index @xmath73 with @xmath3 and the number of e - folds @xmath74 . to see this",
    ", one may define the following slow - roll parameters @xmath75 it is clearly that when the field value @xmath67 is large , the slow - roll parameters are small enough , i.e. @xmath76 , to drive an inflation .",
    "and the inflation will end when @xmath0 goes small and @xmath77 , namely , @xmath78 .",
    "furthermore , the power spectrum of the scalar perturbation is given by @xmath79 with the amplitude @xmath80 given by @xmath81 where we have used the friedmann equation ( [ equ : fried ] ) and also the relation @xmath82 .",
    "here , @xmath83 is called the spectral index , and @xmath84 is the running of the index . and also the spectral indices and its running could be given in terms of the slow - roll parameters : @xmath85 where we have defined @xmath86 .",
    "notice that , the interaction is also important to produce a relatively large running of the spectral index trough the first term in eq.([equ : run ] ) . without interaction ,",
    "i.e. @xmath87 , one could only get a small running of order @xmath88 .",
    "in fact , one can rewrite the running of spectral index as the following @xmath89    the inflaton mass and its field value could be also obtained in terms of @xmath90 and @xmath91 as @xmath92 where @xmath91 satisfies the friedmann equation ( [ equ : fried ] ) that be rewritten as @xmath93 by using eq.([equ : cc ] ) and the value of inflaton field ( [ equ : phi ] ) , we obtain the following equation    @xmath94       = -2\\alpha \\left ( \\sqrt{\\frac{r}{8 } } - \\alpha \\omega_\\lambda \\right ) \\,.\\ ] ]    the number of e - folds before the ending of inflation is defined as @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the value of the inflaton field at time @xmath97 when there are @xmath98 e - foldings to the end of inflation . substituting the observational values of @xmath99 and @xmath100 into eqs.([equ : maineq ] ) and ( [ equ : maineq2 ] ) , we estimate the values of @xmath101 and @xmath102",
    ". then the number of e - folds before the ending of inflation is given by @xmath4 , while the corresponding value of inflaton is @xmath103 .",
    "it indicates that the inflation field dominates the universe when there are about @xmath104 e - foldings to the end of inflation , while it is also accompanied by a small but very important cosmological constant component .",
    "the energy scale of cosmological constant at time @xmath97 is roughly @xmath105 . in other words , when @xmath106 and @xmath107 are around the values estimated above , one can finally obtain a very small @xmath108 just as the same order of magnitude as its present value , see fig.[fig : la ] .",
    "thus , the cosmological constant fine tuning problem is solved by inflation !    the present value of @xmath108 ( measured in the unit of @xmath109 . )",
    "the parameter @xmath110 .",
    "the dashed - orange , solid - black , and dotted - purple curves correspond to @xmath111 respectively . here",
    "the tensor - to - scalar ratio and the scalar power spectral index are fixed at @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in fact , inflation could last longer than @xmath104 e - foldings . assuming the inflation begins at the time @xmath114 when value of the inflaton is @xmath115 , then the corresponding energy scale of cosmological constant is just at the planck scale @xmath116 .",
    "notice that before the time @xmath114 , the effective quantum field theory will break down , and some modifications from the quantum gravity theory are required .    also , one can estimates the mass of inflaton field by substituting @xmath106 and @xmath107 into eq.([equ : mass ] ) : @xmath117gev , which is slighly smaller than that in ref.@xcite .",
    "if @xmath118 is sufficiently large , say @xmath119 in eq.([equ : potential ] ) , the quartic coupling could be @xmath120 , which is required to explain the correct electroweak scale and the higgs boson mass @xmath121 .",
    "the large value of @xmath118 could be understood in terms of symmetry , see refs.@xcite for details .",
    "the running of the spectral index can be also estimated as @xmath2 , when @xmath101 and @xmath122 . in the meanwhile ,",
    "it predicts the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath123 and the spectral index @xmath124 .",
    "we also plot the values of @xmath125 with different @xmath106 and @xmath126 in fig.[fig : na ] .",
    "generally , one can see that the value of @xmath125 could be as larger as the central value @xmath127 from the fitting results of _ planck _ @xcite . in this sense , we have solved the large running of the spectral index problem of inflation .    the running of the scalar power spectral index @xmath125 v.s . the parameter @xmath110 .",

    "the recent detection of b - mode by bicep2 indicates an exciting leap forward in our ability to explore the early universe and fundamental physics .",
    "the measurement of the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath128 shows a very powerful constraint to theoretical inflation models .",
    "higgs boson is the most likely candidate of the inflaton field .",
