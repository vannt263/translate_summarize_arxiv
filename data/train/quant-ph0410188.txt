    "we can say that quantum computation is a young and promising subject and can revolutionize our computational way of tackling problems , especially the simulation of quantum problems numerically .",
    "nowadays quantum computation is a branch of the wider subject  quantum information @xcite which embraces besides quantum computation , for instance , quantum communication and quantum cryptography .",
    "benioff @xcite and r. feynmann @xcite were the pioneers  of quantum computation suggesting the build up of computers  based on the principles of quantum mechanics .",
    "following the lead of benioff and feynmann , d. deutsch in 1985 @xcite made concrete proposals exploring some properties of quantum mechanics to obtain unprecedented parallelism in computation which represented a really breakthrough to the subject which since then has developed quickly although we can still say that perhaps we are far from building a working practical and economically viable hardware based on quantum mechanics , that is , unfortunately we are still far from having , for instance , a quantum pc  for helping us in working out problems and , why not , for our enjoyment .",
    "however , we should point out that although it seems that a quantum computer would speed up the solution of some problems and even turn out possible the solution of some problems intractable by classical computation , nobody still knows what is the real power of a quantum computer when compared with classical computers . despite this fact we should go on in the enterprise of developing research on this field which can at least give us new insights on quantum theory and quantum information science .",
    "important quantum algorithms are the deutsch algorithm @xcite , the deutsch - jozsa algorithm @xcite , the simon algorithm @xcite , the shor algorithm @xcite and the grover algorithm @xcite .    in this work we present an implementation of the deutsch @xcite  and the deutsch - jozsa algorithms @xcite , via cavity qed .",
    "the deutsch algorithm was the first concrete proposal of computation making use of the special features of quantum mechanics",
    ". a recent alternative proposal of realization of the deutsch algorithm is presented in @xcite .",
    "let us start revising the deutsch problem .",
    "consider an arbitrary boolean function @xmath0 .",
    "there are four such a functions corresponding to two possible arguments and two possible values . for two of them",
    "@xmath1 and in this case we say that @xmath2 is constant . for the cases in which @xmath3 we say that @xmath2 is balanced .",
    "suppose we do not know the function and we are given an oracle which can evaluate it and gives us the result .",
    "notice that in order to decide if @xmath2 is constant or balanced we will have to use the oracle twice to know its value for 0 and 1 .",
    "the deutsch algorithm can solve this problem with just one call of the oracle .",
    "let us see how the deutsch algorithm works .",
    "first let us suppose we have a gate ( @xmath4gate ) .",
    "the action of the @xmath5gate is@xmath6the deutsch algorithm employs a @xmath5gate with @xmath2 being our function which we want to decide if is constant or balanced .  considering that the input two qubit state is@xmath7the output is@xmath8since @xmath9 or @xmath10 this",
    "can be written as @xmath11and as we see the effect is to change the state of the @xmath12 qubit to @xmath13 therefore the value of the function is in the phase of the state @xmath12 .    the actual circuit of the deutsch algorithm is shown in fig . 1 where @xmath14 is a hadamard gate@xmath15   \\label{h}\\]]andlatexmath:[\\]]now , in order to obtain a state @xmath84 in cavity @xmath22",
    ", we detect atom @xmath99 in @xmath100 or in @xmath88 . if we detect @xmath100 we must have have  @xmath101  and if we detect @xmath88 we",
    "we must have have  @xmath102    then , we start assuming that the cavity is prepared in a state @xmath84 and atom @xmath37 is prepared in a state@xmath103after the atom fly through the cavity , for @xmath93 , we have@xmath104if @xmath53 we have @xmath105now , if we use the notation      we can rewrite ( [ psia1cbal2 ] ) and ( [ psia1cconst2 ] ) as @xmath56\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[|0\\rangle _ { c}-|1\\rangle _ { c}]\\]]then , in the case of @xmath1 the atom will be in the state @xmath107 or @xmath108 and after we apply the @xmath14 gate we get latexmath:[$\\pm      the speed up achieved in the deutsch algorithm over the classical algorithm is just a factor of two .",
    "however , in a generalized problem , we are going to discuss now , the speedup is much more than in the classical case showing the power of the quantum computation . let us examine now the deutsch - jozsa algorithm to solve the generalized deutsch problem .",
    "let @xmath113 be a boolean function of a n - bit integer argument and we assume allow only those @xmath114 that are either constant or yield 0 for exactly half of the arguments and 1 for the rest , that is , it is balanced . given an oracle that evaluates the function for a given argument , the problem is to decide if @xmath2 is constant or balanced .",
    "there are @xmath115 possible arguments and to solve the problem classically we will have to calculate the function for @xmath116 arguments in the worst case .",
    "then , we see that the computational resources required to solve the problem grows exponentially with the bit size @xmath117 of the input . the deutsch - jozsa algorithm can however solve this problem very easily .",
    "this algorithm makes use of a quantum @xmath118gate that is a generalization of the one we used above in the deutsch algorithm .",
    "the action in the computational basis is similar to that of the ordinary @xmath5gate , except that @xmath119 here is a computational basis state of a @xmath120bit register .",
    "if the bottom qubit is in the state @xmath121 , then the state of the upper register is transformed according to@xmath122the quantum circuit of the deutsch - jozsa algorithm is shown in fig .",
    "the upper input is @xmath123 ( with @xmath117 factors ) and @xmath124 .",
    "then , the effect of the first hadamard gates on the top input state is@xmath125the hadamard gate acting on the bottom input state @xmath126 produces @xmath121 . thus the @xmath118gate changes the state of the register to@xmath127now notice that the action of the hadamard gates on a computational basis state is given by@xmath128where @xmath129 is the bitwise scalar product where for @xmath130 and @xmath131 we have @xmath132 and @xmath133 is addition mod 2 .  then , the state of the register will be @xmath134now , the amplitude of @xmath135 is @xmath136 and if @xmath2 is constant this gives us @xmath137 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath114 is balanced one half of the terms in the sum cancels exactly the other half and the result is 0 .",
    "then , the probability of observing @xmath138 is 1 if @xmath2 is constant and is 0 if it is balanced .",
    "let us see now how we can implement the deutsch - jozsa algorithm experimentally .",
    "considering atoms @xmath139 prepared in a state like ( [ psiat ] ) .",
    "after they fly through @xmath22 prepared in state ( [ c- ] ) , taking into account ( [ u1 ] ) for @xmath93 we have@xmath140if @xmath53 we have @xmath141      now , if we use the notation ( [ atqubits ] ) and ( [ atqubits2 ] ) we can rewrite ( [ psia1a2ancbal ] ) , ( [ psia1a2ancconst ] ) , ( [ psia1a2ancbal2 ] ) and ( [ psia1a2ancconst2 ] ) as @xmath144where , in the case of ( [ psia1a2ancbal ] ) and ( [ psia1a2ancconst ] ) , if @xmath2 is balanced , @xmath145and if @xmath114 is constant , @xmath146 in the case of ( [ psia1a2ancbal2 ] ) and ( [ psia1a2ancconst2 ] ) , @xmath147    now notice that the action of the @xmath14 gates on a computational basis state is given by@xmath148then , the state of the register will be @xmath149now , the amplitude of @xmath150 is @xmath151 and if @xmath2 is constant this gives us @xmath137 .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath114 is balanced one half of the terms in the sum cancels exactly the other half and the result is 0 .",
    "then , the probability of observing @xmath152 is 1 if @xmath2  is constant and is 0 if it is balanced .",
    "therefore , if we detect @xmath153 then @xmath2 is constant .",
    "concluding , a single call to the quantum oracle followed by a measure of the register and checking if the result is @xmath154 allows us to decide if the function is constant or balanced and we have achieved an exponential speedup over the classical computation .",
    "finally , let us analyze the feasibility of the experimental implementation of the above algorithms .",
    "considering rydberg atoms of principal quantum numbers 50 or 51 , the radiative time is of the order of @xmath155 s and the coupling constant @xmath28 is of the order of @xmath156 khz @xcite and the detuning .",
    "@xmath46 is of the order of @xmath157 khz .",
    "taking into account that @xmath158 , for @xmath159 we have an interaction time @xmath160 s and we could , in principle , assume a time of the order of @xmath161 s to realize the algorithm which is much shorter than the radiative time .",
    "we have to consider also the cavity decay time which in recent experiments , with niobium superconducting cavities at very low temperature and quality factors in the @xmath162  range , have a cavity energy damping time of the order of @xmath163 to @xmath164 ms ,  and which could be larger than the required time to perform the algorithm .        *",

    "the transition @xmath169 is far enough of resonance with the cavity central frequency such that only virtual transitions occur between these levels .",
