    "several known scaling relationships between supermassive black holes ( bhs ) and large - scale properties of their host galaxies , such as mass , luminosity , and velocity dispersion , primarily of the bulge component , suggest a joint galaxy and bh cosmic evolution .",
    "in particular , the almost linear correlation between bh mass and bulge mass suggests parallel growth . more specifically , ` for every @xmath2 1000 units of star formation ( sf ) there is @xmath2 12 units of bh accretion' @xcite .",
    "several observational studies attempted to compare bh accretion rate ( bhar ) and sf rates ( sfrs ) on galactic scale and sub - galactic scales ( @xmath31  kpc , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in general , such a comparison shows a large scatter which is somewhat reduced when the sfr is measured over @xmath31  kpc scales , the region more easily influenced by the bh , and more directly identified with the bulge ( although bulges can be significantly larger ) .    taking a statistical approach",
    ", @xcite argued that the volume averaged ratio of bhar to sfr is about constant up to @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite further suggested that the measured bhar / sfr ratio may vary wildly , mostly because the time - variability of bh accretion is much faster than that of sf ( see also * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . in this view , bhar and sfr",
    "may appear uncorrelated in sources taken one by one , but once a large sample is averaged the underlying correlation emerges .",
    "theoretical models have investigated agn activity and sf on different levels @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggested that galaxy mergers enhance both bh activity and sfr .",
    "@xcite performed a series of simulations of equal - mass galaxy mergers to study the sfr - bhar correlation .",
    "they found that the evolution of bhar and sfr in a single merger is highly complex and that the volume averaged correlation is only approximate .",
    "@xcite develops a feedback model that couples sfr and bhar via outflow - induced pressure - enhanced sf .",
    "this model predicts that , on average , bhar @xmath5 sfr , modulated by the radiative and mechanical efficiencies .",
    "@xcite focus , instead , on isolated high - redshift gas - rich galaxies .",
    "they found that a wide range of sfrs is possible if the bhar is low , because such low rates are characterized by high variability driven by the structure of the interstellar medium and by agn feedback .",
    "@xcite developed a semi - analytic model where bhs grow only during star - formation bursts caused by galaxy mergers .",
    "they naturally explained the lack of correlation between sfr and bhar at low agn luminosities as the measured sfr in such phases is being polluted by secular sf that occurred before the burst and hence is unrelated to the agn activity .",
    "high luminosity agn , on the other hand , are observed at times that are close to the peak of the bh accretion event . in this case",
    "the measured sfr traces the merger - driven burst , concurrent with the merger - driven agn - activity .",
    "previous calculations of galaxy mergers with different mass ratios do not have the required spatial and time resolution to follow nuclear inflows and resolve the different timescales involving bh accretion and sf . improving these resolutions would allow us to address , at the same time , the question of whether the time - dependent bhar washes out an underlying correlation with sfr , and whether merging galaxies behave differently from quiescent ones .    the calculations presented in this paper focus on 1 ) the temporal correlation between sfr and bhar , 2 ) the time variability of sfr and bhar , 3 ) the relative growth of stellar mass and bh mass before , during and after a merger ; and 4 ) the relative magnitude of sfr and bhar through all the phases of the merger event .",
    "the purpose is to address the assembly of stellar and bh mass , and the establishment of scaling relations .",
    "we take both the theorists view , asking if an underlying correlation between sfr and bhar exists , and the observers view , asking if a putative underlying correlation between sfr and bhar can be measured .",
    "the simulations represent a major improvement in this direction .",
    "our new suite of hydrodynamical simulations provides very high spatial and temporal resolution ( gas mass of @xmath6  m@xmath7 , softening length of 20 pc for gas and 5  pc for the bhs , bh properties output every 0.1  myr ) , a large range of initial mass ratios ( 1:1 to 1:10 ) , several orbital configurations , and various gas fractions .",
    "in particular , we keep our time , masses and spatial resolution very high throughout the entire merger process and are able to evolve the galaxies for a long time before and after the merger proper .",
    "this means that we are capturing the properties of galaxies in quiescence ( hereafter ` stochastic ' ) phases and between the ` merger ' and the re - establishment of quiescence ( hereafter ` remnant ' phase ) .",
    "the main limitation of our suite is that it does not allow to simulate large galaxies .",
    "each of our mergers requires @xmath8 particles and the entire suite required @xmath9 particles .",
    "the total equivalent simulated time amounted to @xmath230 gyr of evolution .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in  2 we present the numerical setup . in ",
    "3 we describe the general behaviour of a typical merger and in  4 we discuss the temporal correlation between sfr and bhar , while in  5 we compare the time variability of sfr and bhar . in  6 we study the relative growth of stellar mass and bh mass ; and in  7 we explain the various bh and sf relationships extracted from the simulations . in  8 we compare the relationship between bh and sf to observations .",
    "the numerical setup includes a suite of hydrodynamical simulations applied to mergers of disc galaxies with mass ratios of 1:1 , 1:2 , 1:4 , 1:6 , and 1:10 .",
    "the chosen redshift , @xmath10 , corresponds to the peak of the cosmic merger rate .",
    "the calculations and main results are presented below and the appendix adds the necessary information about the dependences on the numerical resolution and the assumed strength of agn feedback .",

    "the merger phase leads , typically , to a higher ratio of bhar to sfr , and therefore of bh mass to stellar mass . however , there are short episodes where the bhar drops significantly with respect to the sfr .",
    "for instance , for @xmath50 at time=0.87 gyr in m2.gf0.3.pro ( top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr_bhar_ratio ] ) .",

    "once additional gas replenishes the bh environs at the third pericentre , accretion restarts at high levels , with the fiducial ratio between bhar and sfr , on all scales , of @xmath2 few @xmath70 .",

    "[ fig : mbh_mstar5kpc ] ) . during the remnant phase ,",
    "bh accretion remains at levels that are slightly higher than before the merger , keeping the ratio of bh mass to stellar mass roughly constant . at the end of the remnant phase ,",
    "when the galaxy is relaxed and the bulge mass can be measured , the bh to bulge mass ratio is between 0.0025 and 0.004 , i.e. about a factor 1.25 to 2 higher than in the initial conditions .     and @xmath12 .",

    "this would create a discontinuity in the curves . ]",
    "a second diagnostic of the enhancement of bhar relative to the sfr during the merger is the cumulative time fraction spent by the bh and galaxy above a given ratio of bhar / sfr .",

    "this ratio increases by a factor @xmath2 5 during the ( transitory ) merger phase , meaning that during this phase the bh grows more efficiently than its host s stellar mass , skewing the bh to stellar mass ratio to higher values .",
    "we find a very weak dependence of this ratio on orbital configurations , and gas fraction , and a somewhat stronger dependence on the mass ratio .",
    "for example , the enhancement in the merger phase in the cases of mass ratios 1:6 and 1:10 is completely dominated by @xmath50 and @xmath13 .",
    "the appendix gives more details about the dependence on feedback efficiency and resolution .     and @xmath13 but we distinguish for each of them the stochastic , merger and remnant phases .",

    "regarding more massive galaxies that are included in observational samples , we speculate that their behaviour can be inferred from the present calculations using some well know properties of star forming galaxies . in such systems the stellar mass and sfr are coupled to form the `` main sequence '' , and in general sfr@xmath71 where @xmath72 with some hints for changes with redshift .",
    "therefore , for galaxies on the main sequence , sfr would increase approximately linearly with stellar mass .",
    "the galaxies we simulate start on the main sequence , but eventually they move away from it as they consume gas . as a consequence , adopting the linear evolution of sfr with mass characteristic of the main sequence is not rigorously correct at all times , but we can use this approach to infer some trends .    we can conjecture how the bhar would scale with the galaxy mass taking as a starting point the work by @xcite . they find that in a sample of agn , at @xmath73 , the probability of finding an agn with a specific accretion rate , i.e. bhar relative to the stellar mass of the host galaxy , can be described by a power - law distribution , with slope @xmath74 , independent of stellar mass ( see also * ? ? ? * where they find a slope closer to unity ) . calculating the same quantity for the collection of all our simulated galaxies ( fig .",

    "perhaps more important are the slopes of the individual phases .",
    "we find that the slope is steeper for the quiescent and remnant phases , and shallower for the merger phase .",

    "in all our simulations , galaxies inhabit the sf dominated region during the stochastic phase and move between the agn and the sf dominated regions during the remnant phase .",
    "however , during the merger phase the evolution is complex and chaotic ( see tracks for all simulations in the online - only material ) . in general ,",
    "not all mergers lead to an appreciable enhancement of agn activity and not all mergers lead to an appreciable enhancement of sf .",
    "for instance , the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : tracks ] is a clear example of a case where bh accretion is not enhanced .",

    "here there is no difference between measuring the ongoing or the instantaneous sfr , except in the first few 100  myr that include part of the merger phase . in summary , for merging and post - merger galaxies ,",
    "a time - averaged sfr worsens the bhar-@xmath55 correlation , without affecting much the behaviour of bhar versus @xmath56 .",
    "we present a suite of simulations devoted to the detailed study of bh and galaxy properties during various type mergers .",
    "this is the first suite that reaches consistent high time ( data on bhar is extracted every 0.1  myr , data on sfr is extracted every 1  myr ) , mass ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 , for stars and gas respectively ) and spatial ( 10  pc and 20  pc , for stars and gas respectively ) resolution for a range of mass ratios that includes minor mergers , down to 1:6 and 1:10 .",
    "we set the initial pericentre distance near 20 percent of the virial radius of @xmath12 , and start from a separation equal to the sum of the virial radii of the two galaxies , in order to be consistent with cosmological orbits .",

    "this allows us to capture the post - merger phase , which may represent the state where most agn are observed , as they show no hint of a companion galaxy . the set - up allows us to resolve nuclear gas inflows in the innermost region ( @xmath3100  pc ) where bhar takes place , as well as to resolve the sf within the galaxy . we can also meaningfully compare bhar and sfr timescales , both in an abstract way ( i.e. instantaneous sfr and bhar occurring within the same time - step ) and in a realistic way more appropriate for a comparison with the observations ( ongoing sfr )",
    "we analyze three phases that we dub ` stochastic ' ( corresponding to a galaxy in isolation or in the early phases of an encounter ) , ` merger ' proper ( when the merger dynamics dominates ) , and ` remnant ' ( from the end of the merger to the return to quiescence ) . our findings can be summarized as follows :    1 .",

    "for agn in the merger phase bhar and sfr are expected to show similar time variability even on galactic scales .",
    "3 .   the merger phase leads , in most cases , to a higher bhar / sfr , by a factor of a few , when averaged over time , and therefore to high bh mass to stellar mass . however , there are short episodes when bhar drops with respect to the sfr , because of supernova and agn feedback triggered by a previous burst of sf or bh activity .",
    "when measured over the same timescales , bhar and @xmath55 are proportional to each other .",
    "the correlation lessens if the ongoing rather than the instantaneous sfr is measured , since the average sfr is associated to a wide range of bhar .",
    "the timescale over which sfr is measured affects less strongly the interpretation of bhar versus @xmath56 .",
    "bhar and @xmath56 show different behaviour during the three stages . from a rough proportionality in the stochastic phase , with bhar @xmath79 ( and a large scatter ) ,",
    "to bhar@xmath80 for the most luminous agn in the merger phase . in the remnant phase ,",
    "galaxies occupy a region where a limited range in @xmath56 corresponds to a large range of bhars .",
    "a major conclusion of our study is that any comparison between bh activity and sfr must take into account the different stages of the merger process since those properties can change dramatically .",
    "while in the stochastic phase galaxies would , for the most part , not be considered agn , the merger phase is when agn and sf activity is close to their peak .",
    "the remnant phase is characterised by a large range of bhars , moving , at times , the galaxy into the agn - dominated region .",

    "study of bh activity and sfr in large agn and galaxy samples , must take into account the different durations of the various phases .",

    "[ fig : sfr_bhar_res ] we compare the bhar and sfr for these four runs of the same merger ( ` lr ' and ` hr ' in the figure captions stands for low - resolution and high - resolution respectively ) , excluding the nuclear sfr , @xmath55 , as we do not resolve adequately that region in the low - resolution runs .",
    "we supplement this figure with the sfr within 1  kpc as a proxy for the central regions , however .",
    "it is clear that @xmath56 is robust against changes in resolution or agn feedback efficiency during the stochastic phase , while the bhar decreases as agn feedback strength increases . in the merger phase",
    "local dynamics becomes more important than feedback efficiency for bhar , and the low - resolution run with @xmath82 has a bhar similar to the low - resolution runs with @xmath83 and @xmath84 . the new stellar mass formed changes by at most 30% among runs with different @xmath85 .",
    "on the other hand , resolution has an important effect : small - scale gravitational torques and small - scale over - densities can not be resolved at low - resolution , leading to an ` average ' bh growth that may be higher than ( e.g. , in the case of @xmath48 ) or similar to ( in the case of @xmath50 ) the high - resolution run , where the region near the bhs is well resolved ( see fig .",

    "therefore , this trend is caused primarily by the effect of agn feedback on the bhar ( sfr is almost unaffected as discussed above ) .",
    "the ratio shows a high value plateau during the merger phase for all mergers , and returns to roughly constant or decreasing values .",
    "[ fig : sfr_bhar_ratio_res ] explicitly shows how the ratio bhar / sfr within 5  kpc , averaging both quantities in bins of 50  myr , depends on resolution and feedback efficiency . by increasing the feedback efficiency the bhar is affected more than @xmath56 , i.e. , the ratio decreases as @xmath85 increases . as a consequence , in the run with @xmath84 , longer time",

    "we note that if agn feedback were as strong as @xmath84 bhs would require growth boosts driven by mergers in order to attain , over cosmic history , a mass compatible with the bh - bulge correlation .",
