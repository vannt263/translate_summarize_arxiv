    "the interplay of interaction and disorder in quantum phase transitions has been an important issue for past decades . in systems of bosonic particles , the phase coherence in a superfluid(sf )",
    "can be destroyed by either interaction or disorder effect .",
    "however , it is not obvious how these two effects interplay to drive the quantum phase transitions . to investigate the role of disorder ,",
    "the superfluid - insulator transitions of the disordered boson hubbard model@xcite in low dimensions have been studied intensively @xcite .",
    "experimental realization of this problem may include the transitions in @xmath0he in porous media@xcite , cold atoms in optical lattices@xcite , superconducting thin films@xcite , and small josephson - junction arrays@xcite .    in the absence of disorder ,",
    "a strong interaction suppresses the density fluctuations and results in a mott insulator ( mi ) . in the phase of mi it costs finite energy to add an extra particle",
    "this energy gap vanishes at the mi - sf transition as the hopping strength increases , allowing delocalized quasi - particles without any energy cost . in the presence of disorder ,",
    "the situation is subtle .",
    "based on a naive single - particle picture , it has been argued that an arbitrarily weak random potential will localize a single - particle excitation as soon as the mott gap vanishes . therefore , there exists an insulating phase with vanishing gap , called the bose glass ( bg ) phase , which intervenes between mi and sf phases .",
    "a hallmark of the bg - sf transition is that the value of the dynamical critical exponent is given by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the dimensionality of the system , since the bg phase is compressible@xcite .",
    "many numerical searches of the bg phase have been performed by identifying the value of the critical exponents including @xmath3 in two dimensions .",
    "though the existence of bg for the strongly disordered case has been generally accepted , for the weakly disordered case it remains as a controversial problem .",
    "direct mi - sf transitions , without the intervening bg phase , have been found @xcite , especially at commensurate fillings , while no clear numerical evidence of the bg phase has been reported in this case .",
    "this may suggest that the physics of disordered system is divided into the strong and the weak regimes , including the possibility that the particle - hole excitations may screen out weak random potentials .",
    "so far most of the numerical works focus on whether the critical exponents support the direct mi - sf transition .",
    "therefore , it is very useful if one can directly observe the gap near the superfluid - insulator transition to clarify whether there exists the gapless insulating bg phase between the mi and the sf phases in the presence of disorder .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate the behavior of the quasi - particle gap as a function of the tuning parameter for different strength of disorder in a disordered two - dimensional boson hubbard model .",
    "we find that for weak disorder the gap vanishes sharp at the transition , strongly supporting the existence of the direct mi - sf transition .",
    "this feature disappears for strong disorder , thus supporting the scenario that the disordered cases are divided into the strong and the weak disorder regimes .",
    "interacting bosons moving in the presence of a random potential can be described by a boson hubbard model @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the boson annihilation ( creation ) operator at @xmath6-th site , @xmath7 is the number operator , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are strength of the on - site interaction and the hopping amplitude between nearest neighboring sites @xmath10 , respectively , and @xmath11 denotes a diagonal random potential due to local impurities .",
    "we take a random potential @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the strength of disorder , to make its average to be zero for the case of a commensurate density .",
    "the phase diagram of this model with possible three phases , known as the mi , bg , and sf , has drawn a great deal of attention , focusing on whether the bg phase intervening between the mi and the sf phases exists even if the disorder is weak .",
    "it is believed that in the limit of large density these phases and the transition between them can be described by the quantum rotor model@xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is the average integer number of bosons per site ) , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the phase angle of bosons at @xmath6-th site .    for numerical simulations ,",
    "it is very useful to write the partition function @xmath19 in terms of dual current variables so that @xmath20 with the corresponding classical hamiltonian@xcite @xmath21 =   \\sum_{(j,\\tau ) } \\big\\{\\frac{1}{2}[j^{x^2}_{(j,\\tau ) } + j^{y^2}_{(j,\\tau ) } + j^{\\tau^2}_{(j,\\tau ) } ] - { \\bar \\mu}_j j^\\tau_{(j,\\tau ) } \\big\\ } , \\label{cl_hamil}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the tuning parameter controlling the quantum fluctuations .",
    "here @xmath23 means the current conservation condition at each site @xmath24 .",
    "note that in this representation the winding number in @xmath25-direction is the net number of bosons , @xmath26 .",
    "in other words , @xmath27 means a commensurate density , and @xmath28 represent the existence of extra quasi - particle ( hole ) , etc .    when temperature @xmath29 , we expect @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the ground state energy of the quantum hamiltonian .",
    "thus @xmath31 is closely related with the free energy of the classical action , @xmath32 .",
    "this allows us to define a quasi - particle gap @xmath33 from the free energy with a fixed number @xmath26 . for finite systems of size @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the size in a spatial direction and @xmath36 in the temporal direction , we use @xmath36 in place of the inverse temperature @xmath37 .",
    "even though the free energy , equivalently the gap , is hard to observe directly , its derivative with respect to @xmath38 @xmath39 is easily obtainable by monte carlo method adopting the classical hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ cl_hamil ] ) .",
    "suppose the gap vanishes at a continuous transition with the dynamical critical exponent @xmath3 and the correlation length critical exponent @xmath40 .",
    "since we have @xmath41 as we approach the transition below , we expect a diverging behavior @xmath42 when @xmath43 , as schematically shown in figure  [ fig : gap ]",
    ". however , if the gap vanishes before the correlation diverges , the diverging behavior of @xmath44 would not appear . by observing @xmath45 , therefore ,",
    "especially its feature of the sharp rise and the subsequent decline , we are able to investigate the behavior of the gap .    the finite - size scaling ansatz of the gap from the hyperscaling relations can be constructed as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a scaling function . by taking a derivative , we have @xmath48 where @xmath49 is another scaling function .",
    "since it is believed that the gap vanishes for bose glass phase and superfluid phase , we expect @xmath50 in those phases .     a schematic plot for the behavior of the energy gap , @xmath51 , and its negative derivative with respect to @xmath52 , @xmath44 .",
    "as gap vanishes continuously at the transition , @xmath44 increases sharp.,width=302 ]",
    "to investigate the behavior of the gap at a commensurate density , the expectation value of the energy in the equivalent classical model are calculated in three replica with @xmath53 and @xmath54 for the same complexions of the random potential @xmath55 , and , then , average over different random potentials are taken .",
    "we adopt a worm algorithm@xcite to update the current configurations in eq .",
    "( [ cl_hamil ] ) while rejecting any updates changing the the winding numbers in @xmath25-direction in order to keep the number of bosons fixed .",
    "in addition , to create a pair of particle and hole , which also does not change the net winding number in @xmath25-direction , a conventional method of the global loop - current update@xcite is performed in @xmath25-direction .",
    "figure  [ fig : pure ] shows the behavior of the gap as a function of @xmath52 for pure case ( @xmath56 ) . near the critical point @xmath57@xcite marked by an arrow in the figure , a stiff rise and the subsequent decline of @xmath58 appears as shown in fig",
    "this feature becomes sharper in bigger systems , indicating that the gap indeed vanishes at the critical point .",
    "interestingly , this behavior satisfies the scaling ansatz of the gap , given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling ] ) as we can find in fig .",
