    "the polaron concept @xcite plays a fundamental role in understanding the interaction between electrons and atoms in a solid material and the related transport of the material . in order to effectively screen the charge of an electron moving in the material , the atoms shift from their equilibrium positions , which can be described as a phonon in the language of the second quantization .",
    "the electron plus the phonon thus form a quasiparticle  the polaron , which is a basic entry point to discussing the electron  phonon interaction in many standard textbooks ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) .    in the past decades",
    ", the polaron has found many applications not only in condensed matter physics such as organic semiconductors @xcite , quantum dots @xcite , and high-@xmath3 superconductors @xcite ( one can refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for an early review , or for a more recent review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) but also in a variety of other fields such as , for example , bose  einstein condensation @xcite , nanoscience @xcite , biophysics @xcite , polymers @xcite , and so on .",
    "recently , it has also been extended to study spin coherence @xcite in a dissipative quantum system , namely , the spin  boson model @xcite .",
    "while these works @xcite have focused on the dissipative environment , the physics of polarons in a single - mode optical field have not been explored systematically .",
    "in fact , a two - level atom ( qubit ) coupled to a single - mode optical field is the simplest system describing the interaction between light and matter , which is a basic model in quantum optics @xcite , quantum information @xcite , and condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "this model is well known as the rabi model @xcite , which has attracted much attention in the past few years . on the one hand , the exact solutions of this model @xcite and its cousins @xcite have been obtained only recently , which marks an important step toward the understanding of the mathematical structure of this model by proving its integrability @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the experimental progress @xcite toward significant enhancement of the light  matter coupling strength raises the request to consider a full quantum rabi model in order to explain experimental observations @xcite .    however , since numerically solving for the transcendental function zeros in the exact solution is not an easy task , understanding the model from some simple viewpoints is still needed . to explore the physical properties of the rabi model in some intuitive ways ,",
    "many approximation methods have been developed ; these include , for example , the adiabatic approximation @xcite , the generalized rotating - wave approximation @xcite , and the generalized variational method @xcite .",
    "a systematic comparison study of these methods has been given in ref .",
    "it was shown that all these methods are unable to capture the correct physics in the intermediate coupling strengths , especially in the small @xmath1 ( harmonic oscillator frequency ) limit .",
    "apart from the double precision problem in eigenstate calculations@xcite and the careful attention one might need to pay to the criterion and parameter regime for quantum integrability @xcite , it also might be worthwhile to recognize that the basic energy scales involved in the rabi model compete with each other in a subtle way @xcite .",
    "all these factors might contribute to the fact that the physics of the quantum rabi model still has not been fully explored .",
    "thus , one should face the challenge of using an intuitive way to understand the rabi model in a general case , in which extensive physics phenomena might be involved @xcite . in our previous work @xcite",
    ", we found that the deformed polaron picture is a good starting point to study the rabi model in the whole parameter regime , and furthermore , a ground state phase diagram of the rabi model has been extracted and some underlying physics unveiled .",
    "essentially , this diagram consists of two regimes , namely , the bipolaron regime in the strong coupling and the quadpolaron regime in the weak coupling , with a deep nature of symmetry breaking in their transition or crossover .",
    "interestingly , in the latter regime , an overweighted anti - polaron region has been found .",
    "while the basic physics of the rabi model has been clarified @xcite , much less attention has been paid to the asymmetric case , in which the parity symmetry is further broken .",
    "in fact , from the experimental viewpoint , the asymmetric case is more usual .",
    "therefore , it is important to study how the finite asymmetric term affects the basic properties of the rabi model .",
    "the presence of the asymmetric term evidently increases the difficulty of solving the model , owing to parity breaking ; therefore , we first numerically solve the asymmetric rabi model for its ground state wave function .",
    "it is found that the asymmetric term tends to trigger the appearance of the so - called overweighted anti - polaron .",
    "based on the polaron picture , we analyze the competition of a variety of energy scales involved in the asymmetric rabi model , and clarify how an overweighted anti - polaron explicitly appears . if the strength of the asymmetric term is less than the harmonic oscillator frequency , it is found that the overweighted anti - polaron can occur at a certain coupling strength @xmath4 , at which the entanglement entropy drops rapidly to a vanishingly small value and the sign of the displacement of the up - spin component changes from negative to positive .",
    "if the strength of the asymmetric term is greater than the harmonic oscillator frequency , the negatively displaced components are totally suppressed and the anti - polaron in the up - spin component is always overweighted .",
    "these results could be tested by measuring the displacement of the harmonic oscillator in the up- or down - spin components via the balanced homodyne detection method @xcite in quantum optics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] , the rabi model with the asymmetric term is introduced and formulated in position representation . in sec .",
    "[ polaron ] , based on the polaron picture , we numerically solve the symmetric and asymmetric rabi model and obtain the ground state wave function for different coupling strengths .",
    "the occurrence of the overweighted anti - polaron and its mechanism are analyzed . in sec .",
    "[ observable ] , we calculate the displacements of the up- and down - spin components , which provide an experimentally accessible physical quantity to detect the overweighted anti - polaron . in sec .",
    "[ variational ] , by a variational discussion , the connection between the wave function based on the polaron / anti - polaron picture and the approximate methods widely used in the literature is clarified , which facilitates an analytical derivation of the critical asymmetry strength .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ section_con ] is devoted to a brief summary .",
    "the hamiltonian of the asymmetric quantum rabi model @xcite ( @xmath5 ) is @xmath6 where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is the annihilation ( creation ) operator of the bosonic field with frequency @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the pauli matrix of the qubit , @xmath11 is the energy splitting of the qubit , @xmath12 is a strength breaking the parity symmetry of the system , and @xmath2 , which must be positive , is the coupling strength .",
    "one can transform eq . to the following equivalent hamiltonian by the spin rotation @xmath13 as well as the parameter replacements @xmath14 and @xmath15 :    @xmath16    which has the same notation as the spin ",
    "boson model@xcite on a @xmath17 basis .",
    "thus , @xmath18 , which is positive and taken as the unit of energy unless otherwise specifically stated , determines the tunneling rate between the two eigenstates of @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath0 is the asymmetry strength . in this work",
    ", the coupling strength @xmath2 will be scaled by a critical value @xmath19 @xcite , where a superradiance phase transition occurs @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that the rabi model has wide relevance and applications , ranging from quantum optics@xcite , superconducting circuit quantum electrodynamics@xcite to condensed matter physics@xcite .",
    "the notation may be different in different communities , as pointed out by irish@xcite .",
    "hereafter , for the convenience of our analysis , we shall discuss on the basis of eq .",
    ", whose symmetric part has also been widely used in the literature@xcite .    in terms of the coordinate operator @xmath20 and momentum operator @xmath21 , eq .",
    "( [ rabi ] ) can be reformulated as @xmath22 where @xmath23 $ ] , with @xmath24 , describes a displaced harmonic oscillator with the displacement direction conditioned by the qubit state .",
    "one sees that the displacement is driven by the interaction and simultaneously also affected by the mode frequency @xmath1 .",
    "the eigenstate of eq .",
    "( [ xp_dis ] ) can take a general form @xmath25 are the eigenstates of @xmath17 and here @xmath26 denotes the spin orientation , and @xmath27 , the corresponding oscillator states , satisfy @xmath28 .",
    "the eigenstates are determined by the following schrdinger equations coupled for up- and down - spins , @xmath29 \\phi _ { \\pm } + \\frac \\omega 2\\phi _ { \\mp } = e\\phi _ { \\pm } , \\ ] ] which will be solved numerically in the present work by an expansion on the basis set of the standard quantum harmonic oscillator @xcite with a truncation judged via the distribution weight on a basis , which is cut off if below a sufficiently small value . here",
    ", we employ the basis @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the fock state , and the preserved hilbert space is up to 6000-dimensional , so that the distribution weight is smaller than @xmath32 .",
    "we believe that false convergence @xcite is prevented by considering this large preserved hilbert space . a deep discussion on the convergency of the numerical method for the rabi model can be seen in ref .",
    "one sees that the @xmath33 term plays a role of spin flipping ; it is also referred to as the tunneling term , owing to an effective barrier between the two wells of the left and right displaced harmonic potential in the single - particle description@xcite .",
    "to provide a reference for the asymmetric case , we first illustrate the symmetric case . for the symmetric case ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath34 , one can find that the parity operator @xmath35 is conserved because @xmath36 = 0 $ ] .",
    "thus , eq . ( [ general_wave ] ) is also the eigenstate of @xmath37 , which results in @xmath38 where @xmath39 , and @xmath40 and @xmath41 represent even and odd parities , respectively . in this work ,",
    "we only discuss the ground state , which is in odd parity .    in the absence of the tunneling term @xmath42 ,",
    "the ground state of the hamiltonian ( [ xp_dis ] ) consists of two polarized states surrounded by photons that are induced by displacement from the central origin position .",
    "as is known , the ground state of the harmonic oscillator is a photon vacuum , but a displaced state is accompanied by photons .",
    "this resembles the polaron in condensed matter , where the electron is surrounded with photons that are induced by deviation of atoms from their equilibrium positions .",
    "thus , these right ( @xmath43 ) and left ( @xmath44 ) displaced states can be considered as polarons@xcite .",
    "the polaron located at @xmath43 is bounded to @xmath45 and that located at @xmath44 is bounded to @xmath46 .",
    "when the @xmath18 term is gradually increased , the displacement and the tunneling between two polarization states start to compete . on the one hand ,",
    "the polarons prefer to reside at the positions of @xmath47 in order to avoid the cost from higher harmonic oscillator potential in deviating away . on the other hand",
    ", the presence of the tunneling requires that these two polarons should be as close as possible to increase the effective tunneling . as a consequence of this competition , anti -",
    "polarization components arise ; namely , an anti - polaron with negative displacement is bounded to @xmath45 and one with a positive displacement is bounded to @xmath46 , in the opposite displacement directions of the polarons . in this case , the harmonic oscillator wave function components in eq .",
    "( [ general_wave ] ) in both the up- and down - spins can be divided into two parts : @xmath48 where the subscript @xmath26 labels the spin orientation and the superscripts @xmath49 and @xmath50 denote the polaron and anti - polaron , respectively . for simplicity , here , we have incorporated the weights of the polaron and the anti - polaron@xcite into @xmath51 so that the height of the wavepacket peaks will directly reflect the weights of the separated polaron and anti - polaron .",
    "subject to the constraint of parity symmetry , the harmonic oscillator wave function components satisfy the following relations : @xmath52    , @xmath34 , and @xmath53 in ( a ) , @xmath54 in ( b ) , @xmath55 in ( c ) , @xmath56 in ( d ) , @xmath57 in ( e ) , and @xmath58 in ( f ) . ]    to illustrate the profiles of the polaron and anti - polaron , the numerical result of the ground state wave function with frequency @xmath59 is shown in fig .",
    "[ wave_un ] for different coupling strengths ( in the symmetric model ) . increasing the coupling strengths , two characteristic features have been observed .",
    "one is the separation of the polaron and anti - polaron peaks . at sufficiently weak coupling , as shown in fig .",
    "[ wave_un ] ( a ) , the tunneling dominates over the polaron displacements , and as a result , the polaron and anti - polaron overlap so much that , finally , only one total peak is observed around the center position . as the coupling strength increases to @xmath60 ,",
    "the peaks begin to deform and shift away from the center position , as seen in fig .",
    "[ wave_un ] ( b ) .",
    "the change is more obvious by further increasing the coupling strengths , as shown in fig .",
    "[ wave_un ] ( c)(f ) .",
    "the two separated peaks gradually shift toward the position of @xmath47 , where the coupling dominates over the tunneling .",
    "the other feature lies in the weights of the polaron and anti - polaron .",
    "although the weight variation in the weak and intermediate couplings is diversified@xcite , after full separation the weight of the anti - polaron becomes smaller and smaller .",
    "this is understandable , since the anti - polaron needs to overcome the increasing cost of higher and higher harmonic oscillator potentials .",
    "one notes on these characteristic features and their transitions can be well described by the energy scale @xmath60 defined above , which has been shown to be valid only in small-@xmath1 limit @xcite . in this case , these transitions show phase - transition - like behavior @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out that in the small-@xmath1 limit , there is indeed a quantum phase transition between the normal and superradiance phases@xcite . from fig .",
    "[ wave_un ] ( b ) and ( c ) , where the coupling is around the critical coupling @xmath60 , we see that the polaron and anti - polaron start to displace and separate in a narrow interval , which indicates a phase transition .",
    "we can also find that the so - called superradiance phase exhibits displacement and separation between the polaron and anti - polaron .",
    "for a larger @xmath1 , the definition of @xmath60 here is no longer a good energy scale @xcite , and these transitions cross over , as will be shown later . in the following",
    "we consider the physics with finite asymmetry strength .       and",
    "the coupling strengths are the same as those in fig .",
    "[ wave_un ] . ]    in the asymmetric model , @xmath62 , the parity symmetry is broken ; as a result , eqs . are no longer valid . as a comparison to the symmetric model ,",
    "the numerical results for the ground state wave function are presented in fig .",
    "[ wave ] at the same frequency as in fig .",
    "[ wave_un ] , @xmath59 , but in the presence of a finite asymmetry strength @xmath63 . in the weak coupling regime ( @xmath64 ) , the features of the wave functions are similar to those in the symmetric model . however , as @xmath65 , the characteristic behaviors of the wave functions are dramatically different .",
    "first , the weights of the up- and down - spin components are different .",
    "second , the polaron and anti - polaron for the two spin components behave completely differently . for the first point , it is not unexpected , since the finite asymmetry strength is more favorable for the down - spin component .",
    "however , the second point is counter - intuitive and nontrivial . for the down - spin component , the weight of the anti - polaron ( right wave - packets in dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ wave](c)(f ) ) decays sooner in comparison with that of the symmetric version .",
    "more dramatically , the weight of the polaron ( right wave - packets in solid lines ) in the up - spin component decays even more rapidly , and these disappearing weights move totally to the polaron in the down - spin component ( left wave - packets in dashed lines ) with increasing coupling strength .    in this process",
    ", the weight of the anti - polaron in the up - spin component ( left wave - packets in solid lines ) becomes larger than that of the polaron ( right wave - packets in solid lines ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ wave ] ( e ) and ( f ) .",
    "this is the situation of the overweighted anti - polaron .",
    "therefore , the appearance of the overweighted anti - polaron in the up - spin component is here due to the interplay between the tunneling , coupling of light and matter , and finite asymmetry strength .",
    "the overweighted anti - polaron also occurs in the symmetric rabi model in an implicit way , as uncovered in ref .",
    "however , there , the overweighted anti - polaron appears symmetrically for both spin directions with a different mechanism in the subtle competition between the tunneling , coupling , as well as the harmonic frequency , and it only occurs in certain regions . here , a dominant role is played by the finite asymmetry strength : all weights of the negative displacement and the anti - polaron in the up - spin component will vanish as the coupling strength increases .",
    "thus , in the finite asymmetry strength case , the overweighted anti - polaron in the up - spin component must occur beyond a certain coupling strength .",
    "this is the central result of the present work .    in the following we",
    "further analyze the physics of the model from the viewpoint of energy competition . in the asymmetric rabi model ,",
    "there exist four energy scales , namely , the harmonic frequency @xmath1 , tunneling rate @xmath18 ( set to unity ) , coupling strength @xmath2 , and asymmetry strength @xmath0 .",
    "first , the competition between the effective tunneling and coupling strength , which drives the displacement of the potential at a given frequency as indicated by @xmath43 , determines whether the polaron and anti - polaron components get separated , and this phase - transition - like behavior is described by the parameter @xmath60 in the small-@xmath1 case .",
    "second , once the polaron and anti - polaron components become separated , tunneling between the left and right sides , which is unfavorable for the asymmetry strength , is significantly weakened .",
    "the tunneling , remaining on same sides , becomes more compatible with the asymmetry strength and these may even support each other .",
    "thus , the interplay between asymmetry strength and the remaining effective tunneling , in competition with the potential energy cost for increasing the anti - polaron weight , determines whether the negative displacement components are suppressed and whether the overweighted anti - polaron appears .",
    "this changeover turns out to be the second phase - transition - like behavior .    to further understand the competitions , we combine the analysis with an explicit situation in the example we illustrated . for the parameters we have used in fig .",
    "[ wave ] , the energy scales involved are @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , for a sufficiently small coupling strength @xmath68 , the tunneling energy ( characterized by @xmath18 ) is dominant . in this situation ,",
    "the oscillator displacement is totally suppressed , not to mention the even weaker asymmetry strength , which is completely overwhelmed by the tunneling energy . in this case , the asymmetry strength plays a minor role in determining the ground state .",
    "however , as the coupling strength increases , e.g. , @xmath65 , the situation changes dramatically .",
    "in fact , the polaron and anti - polaron will shift away from the central position , owing to the increasing coupling . as a consequence of the displacements ,",
    "the effective tunneling between the polaron and polaron , polaron and anti - polaron , as well as anti - polaron and anti - polaron decays exponentially .",
    "therefore , when the effective tunneling decays to a small value comparable to the asymmetry strength , the asymmetry strength comes to play a considerable role .",
    "in such a situation , the asymmetry strength interplays with the tunneling , since moving the weights of the left - hand - side polaron and anti - polaron to the right - hand - side polaron is favorable both for the asymmetry strength and tunneling energies .",
    "this mutually beneficial interplay quickly wins its competition at the cost of the coupling - and - frequency - dependent potential energy in weight moving and thus , all weights in the up - spin components and those of the anti - polaron of the down - spin components transfer rapidly to the polaron in the down - spin components . as a result , an overweighted anti",
    "- polaron in the spin - up component occurs .",
    "this also behaves like a phase transition , as seen from the entanglement entropy calculations for different asymmetry strengths .     for different asymmetry strengths : @xmath69 ( black ) , @xmath70 ( red ) , @xmath61 ( blue ) , @xmath71 ( green ) , and @xmath72 ( dark yellow ) .",
    "]    the entanglement entropy can be quantified by von neumann entropy : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the reduced density matrix of the qubit .",
    "the result is presented in fig .",
    "it has been noticed that the behaviors of entanglement entropy in the symmetric and asymmetric models are quite different @xcite .",
    "here , based on the polaron and anti - polaron concept , we present a physical picture to understand the behavior of entanglement . as seen from fig .",
    "[ 001s ] , the entanglement entropy has two phase - transition - like points ; one is near @xmath60 , marking the separation of the polaron and anti - polaron , and there the entropy increases dramatically . in the symmetric rabi model , the entropy saturates in the strong coupling limit .",
    "however , in the asymmetric model , after the entropy increases to certain value , it drops rapidly to a vanishing small value , marking another phase - transition - like behavior .",
    "this is due to the asymmetry - induced anti - polaron , which efficiently decreases the entanglement . when the asymmetry strength increases , the latter phase - transition - like behavior happens earlier , but the asymmetry finally becomes dominant and the phase - transition - like behaviors cross over",
    "so far , we have revealed the appearance of an overweighted anti - polaron around an additional transition - like behavior induced by the asymmetric term .",
    "now , a natural question arises : whether the overweighted anti - polaron can be observed in an experiment . to answer this question ,",
    "let us consider a physical quantity , @xmath75 , which is defined as an average of the oscillator state of either the up - spin or down - spin , namely , @xmath76 @xmath77 describes the displacement of the oscillator state @xmath27 .",

    "the wave functions shown in fig .",
    "[ wave ] correspond to the set of parameters denoted by solid and dotted blue lines ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "the solid and dotted black lines denote the symmetric case .",
    "as one sees , in the small asymmetry strength cases , the harmonic oscillators do not displace far away from the central position up to @xmath94 . beyond @xmath60 ,",
    "the displacements vary rapidly but in different ways , depending on the absence or presence of the asymmetric term . in the symmetric case",
    ", the displacement amplitude grows quickly and then approaches the saturation value @xmath95 , with the spin - up and spin - down components being symmetric .",
    "this symmetry in the evolution is broken by finite asymmetry strength .",
    "a striking change can be observed for the spin - up component , which suddenly stops growing in the negative direction and turns abruptly to become positive at a certain coupling strength @xmath4 .",
    "a larger asymmetry strength will have a smaller sign reversing point @xmath4 , whose overall dependence on the finite asymmetry strength value and the harmonic frequency is shown in fig .",
    "the change at @xmath4 is quite sudden and similar to a phase - transition , which is consistent with the dropping behavior of the entanglement entropy .",
    "moreover , when we further increase the asymmetry strength , we find that both displacements for the up- and down - spin components become positive throughout the evolution with respect to the coupling strength , as in the @xmath96 , @xmath97 cases in fig .",

    "this is the case in which both displacements for the up- and down - spin components are positive and the anti - polaron ( if it survives ) is always overweighted , as mentioned in the strong asymmetry strength cases at @xmath92 . therefore , there exists a critical asymmetry strength @xmath102 which determines whether the oscillator displacement transition from negative to positive value in spin - up component will occur .",
    "our numerical calculations indicate that : @xmath103 in the next section , we provide a variational method to discuss the result analytically .",
    "before deriving the analytic expression for @xmath102 , it might be worthwhile to see the implications that the previously discussed polaron and anti - polaron provide for variational methods .",
    "taking the polaron concept as a starting point , one can build a connection between the wave function profiles obtained in the present work and the approximate methods widely used in the literature@xcite .",

    "then , the energy expression can be obtained as @xmath108 minimizing the energy with respect to @xmath109 leads to @xmath110 and the ground - state energy becomes : @xmath111 if @xmath107 is fixed to be @xmath112 , those results discussed in refs .",
