    "<S> we report theoretical investigations on how edge states are destroyed in disordered mesoscopic samples by calculating a  phase diagram \" in terms of energy versus disorder strength @xmath0 , and magnetic field versus disorder strength @xmath1 , in the integer quantum hall regime . it is found that as the disorder strength @xmath2 increases , edge states are destroyed one by one if transmission eigen - channels are used to characterize the edge states . near the insulating regime , </S>",
    "<S> transmission eigen - channels are closed one by one in the same order as edges states are destroyed . to identify those edge states which have survived disorder , </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a generalized current density that can be calculated and visualized .    when a two - dimensional _ mesoscopic _ sample is subjected to external magnetic field , peculiar electronic states  edge states , may be established at the boundaries of the sample@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> classically , lorentz force pushes electrons toward the sample boundary and electron trajectories become skipping orbits . </S>",
    "<S> edge states can be considered as the quantum version of skipping orbits@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , edge states in mesoscopic samples provide necessary density of states ( dos ) between the landau levels , integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) can therefore occur in the clean sample limit@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for infinitely large samples , a degree of disorder in the sample appears necessary which provides dos in between landau levels to stablize the fermi energy for iqhe@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , increasing disorder will eventually destroy iqhe and how does this happen has been an important issue attracting numerous studies .    </S>",
    "<S> here we address the disorder issue for _ mesoscopic _ samples , namely how edge states are destroyed by disorder in the iqhe regime and , at a fixed filling factor @xmath3 , are edge states destroyed all at once or one by one . </S>",
    "<S> these important questions provide insight to the iqhe phase diagram for mesoscopic samples , and may shed light to similar problems in samples of infinite size . </S>",
    "<S> we address these questions by extensive calculations on a mesoscopic graphene system and a square lattice model ( see inset of fig.[fig1]a ) to map out a  phase diagram \" of edge states in the presence of disorder . here </S>",
    "<S> the  phases \" in the  phase diagram \" denote quantum states and no phase transitions are implied between these states . </S>",
    "<S> we use transmission eigen - channels to characterize edge states ( see below ) , and we found that they are destroyed one by one . at large enough disorder , </S>",
    "<S> the system becomes an insulator and transmission eigen - channels are closed one by one in the same order as the edge states are destroyed .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin by discussing our definition of edge states as well as the way to visualize them . in transport theory , for each incoming channel of a semi - infinite lead @xmath4 whose wave function is @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes one of the @xmath7 channels , one solves a scattering problem . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 is an eigen - channel of lead-@xmath4 but not the entire device . to find the eigen - channels of the entire device , we diagonalize@xcite the transmission matrix @xmath8 by a unitary transformation @xmath9 , for a two probe device having scattering matrix @xmath10 , @xmath11 </S>",
    "<S> mathematically , this means acting @xmath9 on the incoming channels @xmath5 ( which is a column vector with n components ) to obtain a new set of orthogonal incoming modes @xmath12 , it will traverse the entire device without mixing with any other eigen - state @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> this way , the resulting transmission matrix @xmath14 is diagonal . in the presence of a strong magnetic field @xmath15 , it is therefore natural to identify @xmath16 as edge states because they are the eigen - states or eigen - channels of the entire device sample . how to visualize edge states in the iqhe regime </S>",
    "<S> this may be achieved by plotting the current density in real space . </S>",
    "<S> the subtle issues of current density in iqhe has been discussed in ref .. in our work where there are disorder in the sample , the eigen - channels provide a convenient way to define a generalized current density for each channel  since the eigen - channels do not mix . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the total transport current is obtained by integrating current density along any cross - section perpendicular to the transport direction .    </S>",
    "<S> the total transmission coefficient is obtained from the @xmath17 hermitian transmission matrix @xmath18 . applying an unitary transformation @xmath9@xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain @xmath19 , which is diagonal with elements @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the transmission coefficient @xmath20 of eigen - channel @xmath21 is a linear combination of @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> using conventional current density @xmath23 with @xmath24 , it is easy to show @xmath25 in the linear bias regime , where @xmath26 is the diagonal element of matrix @xmath8 . in order to find an _ eigen - current density _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath27 such that @xmath28 we define a generalized complex current density @xmath29 so that @xmath30 . the unitary transformation on the incoming wave function </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 suggests the following definition : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the wave function in the scattering region due to the incoming state @xmath33 . from this definition </S>",
    "<S> , we can prove the relationship @xmath34 , as follows . </S>",
    "<S> it is not difficult to show that the following @xmath27 satisfies eq.([eq1 ] ) : @xmath35 where @xmath36 . using this @xmath37 , eq.([eq1 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> becomes @xmath38 denoting @xmath39 the generalized current density matrix with matrix elements @xmath29 , eq.([eq2 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath40 we have also confirmed eq.([gen1 ] ) numerically using specific examples including that shown in the inset of fig.[fig1]a . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , to obtain eigen - current density matrix , we first diagonalize the transmission matrix @xmath8 to find the unitary matrix @xmath9 ; we then calculate the generalized current density @xmath41 according to eq.([gen ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the eigen - current density matrix is finally obtained by @xmath42 and plotted for visualization .    </S>",
    "<S> can eigen - channels be measured experimentally ? to answer this question , as an example let s consider a two - probe device having two eigen - channels or two edge states in the presence of magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> assume one can perform two experiments : ( i ) measurement of conductance and ( ii ) measurement of shot noise . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , conductance is given by @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the shot noise is given by@xcite @xmath44 $ ] . from these @xmath45 and @xmath46 can be determined . in the case of three eigen - channels </S>",
    "<S> , one needs to experimentally measure an additional quantity@xcite , for instance the third cumulant of current @xmath47 . in the linear regime , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath48@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence by measuring @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , one can determine @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the transmission eigen - channels are physical quantities measurable experimentally .     plane ; ( b ) in the @xmath1 plane . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) the order of closing of eigen - channels at large disorder . </S>",
    "<S> color coding are for number of eigen - channels.,width=340,height=245 ]    having prepared analytical tools , we now present numerical calculations on how the edge states are destroyed by increasing degrees of disorder . in the tight - binding representation </S>",
    "<S> , the hamiltonian of 2d honeycomb lattice of graphene can be written as : @xmath53 where @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for an electron on site @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> the first term in @xmath57 is the on - site single particle energy where diagonal disorder is introduced by drawing @xmath58 randomly from a uniform distribution in the interval @xmath59 $ ] where @xmath2 measures the disorder strength . </S>",
    "<S> the second term in @xmath57 is due to nearest neighbor hopping that includes the effect of a magnetic field . here </S>",
    "<S> the phase @xmath60 and @xmath61 is the flux quanta . </S>",
    "<S> we fix gauge so that @xmath62 ; and current flows in the x - direction . </S>",
    "<S> transmission coefficient is given by @xmath63 $ ] where the transmission matrix @xmath8 is obtained from @xmath64 with @xmath65 being the retarded and advanced green functions of the disordered scattering region . </S>",
    "<S> quantities @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) are the line width functions obtained by calculating self - energies @xmath68 due to the semi - infinite leads@xcite . the numerical data are mainly obtained from systems with @xmath69 sites . in the calculations , energy and disorder strength </S>",
    "<S> are measured in unit of coupling strength @xmath70 .     </S>",
    "<S> plane for : ( a ) hole - like charge carriers in graphene ; ( b ) electrons in a square lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the main difference between the two phase diagrams is due to opposite charges of hole and electron.,width=302,height=226 ]    numerically , an edge state is identified if transmission coefficient of an eigen - channel is @xmath71 ; if @xmath72 , the eigen - channel is said to be closed . in addition </S>",
    "<S> , an edge state is said to be  destroyed \" by disorder and becomes a regular eigen - channel if its transmission @xmath73 drops to below @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> fig.[fig1]a plots the phase diagram of edge states of graphene in the @xmath0 plane with @xmath75 and energy range @xmath76 $ ] where band dispersion is linear ( dirac electrons ) . </S>",
    "<S> a mesh of @xmath77 points are scanned in @xmath0 plane and up to 200 disorder configurations are averaged at each point . </S>",
    "<S> several observations are in order . </S>",
    "<S> first , the edge states are destroyed one by one as @xmath2 is increased . for instance , at @xmath78 the @xmath79 edge state is destroyed when @xmath80 . very importantly , we emphasize that at this disorder , there are still three transmission eigen - channels although only two are edge states and the third being a regular eigen - channel having @xmath81 . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the third eigen - channel is still there to participate transport although it is no longer an edge state . </S>",
    "<S> increasing disorder to @xmath82 , the @xmath83 edge state is destroyed ; finally when @xmath84 , all three edge states are destroyed . </S>",
    "<S> we note that edge states would be destroyed all at once if we had used the usual transmission coefficient for each channel @xmath26 to characterize the edge states . </S>",
    "<S> second , upon further increasing @xmath2 , an insulating state is reached where all eigen - channels are closed . </S>",
    "<S> the order of channel closing is also one by one , in the same order as how edge states are destroyed . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown in fig.[fig1]c . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , at @xmath78 there are three eigen - channels to start with , and at large disorder @xmath85 , one of them is closed leaving only two regular eigen - channels . </S>",
    "<S> third , the edge states are easily destroyed at the subband edges while at the subband center they are most robust against disorder . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the energy of landau levels is located at the subband edge . in the presence of disorder , </S>",
    "<S> the landau level is broadened with a finite width@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence the edge state that is close to one landau level can easily relax toward it . </S>",
    "<S> forth , it is more difficult to destroy an edge state at smaller energies . for dirac electrons , </S>",
    "<S> the density of states is proportional to @xmath86 so that the level spacing of lower landau levels is larger than the upper ones . for electrons with smaller energy </S>",
    "<S> it is farther away from nearby landau level than electrons with larger energy . </S>",
    "<S> hence a larger disorder is needed to relax the electrons to the nearby landau level . finally , fig.[fig1]b plots a  phase diagram \" of edge states in the @xmath1 plane for dirac electrons . once again </S>",
    "<S> , the edge states are destroyed one by one , similar to the phase diagram in the @xmath0 plane .    </S>",
    "<S> fig.[fig2]a depicts the  phase diagram \" of edge states of graphene in @xmath0 plane for higher energies in the range @xmath87 $ ] , where hole - like behavior occurs and band dispersion is non - linear ( non - dirac electrons ) . </S>",
    "<S> again , edge states are destroyed one by one . while the  phase diagram \" topology is similar to that for dirac electrons ( fig.[fig1 ] ) , here the band dispersion is quadratic with equal energy spacing between the landau levels . due to this reason , </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath2 that are needed to destroy the last edge state at different subband centers are almost the same . </S>",
    "<S> we have also calculated the  phase diagram \" of edge states of a square lattice in the @xmath0 plane using the same numerical method , results are shown in fig.[fig2]b which are rather similar fig.[fig2]a . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it is more difficult to destroy edge states at low filling factor @xmath88 , consistent with the result of ref ..     sites in the absence of disorder . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath89 and @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the color scale is different for the two panels . </S>",
    "<S> insets : classical skipping orbits.,width=340,height=226 ]    next , we examine the nature of those edge states that have survived disorder by calculating current density from eqs.([gen ] ) and ( [ gen1 ] ) and plotting it along the propagating direction ( x - direction ) . </S>",
    "<S> fig.[fig3 ] shows the current density of two edge states in the absence of disorder for the square lattice model . </S>",
    "<S> edge states are clearly seen . </S>",
    "<S> since the two transmission eigen - channels have different longitudinal energies or effective velocities along the propagating direction , it gives two different transmission patterns that correspond to two different skipping orbits of classical trajectory@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fig.[fig3]a , current flows in the negative direction ( blue region ) near the sample boundary and in the positive direction ( red region ) away from it . there is a region between these opposite flows where the current density is very small . </S>",
    "<S> the classical trajectory of an electron under lorentz force is depicted in the inset , showing a nearly completed circular motion before colliding with the sample boundary . </S>",
    "<S> there is an one - to - one correspondence between the classical and quantum motion : near the sample boundary the flow is from right to left , while it flows opposite away from the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> similar one - to - one correspondence is also seen in fig.[fig3]b . </S>",
    "<S> for the same square lattice model , fig.[fig4 ] plots the current density of two eigen - channels for a particular disorder configuration @xmath84 where the eigen transmission coefficients are @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> in the numerical calculation , we have confirmed that the integral of @xmath93 over any cross - section area along the propagating direction gives the same value that is equal to @xmath94 . from fig.[fig4]a , it is obvious that @xmath91 is an edge state that survived this degree of disorder . </S>",
    "<S> compare to fig.[fig3 ] , the pattern of current density with disorder scattering is clearly different . </S>",
    "<S> for the eigen - channel with @xmath92 , it is clearly a non - edge state ( fig.[fig3]b ) : there is a circulating patten with large current density in the middle of the scattering region , caused by the disorder scattering . finally , we have also calculated current density for edge states in disordered graphene , and similar behaviors are observed as that of fig.[fig4 ] .    , with disorder strength @xmath84 , </S>",
    "<S> energy @xmath89 and magnetic field @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) for an edge state that has survived disorder ; ( b ) edge state that has been destroyed by disorder.,width=340,height=226 ]    in summary , we have investigated the nature of edge states in disordered mesoscopic samples in the iqhe regime . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that edge states are destroyed one by one as disorder strength is increased . in the insulating regime , </S>",
    "<S> all transmission eigen - channels are closed and the closing is also one by one in the same order as the edge states were destroyed </S>",
    "<S> . for graphene and the square lattice model , the  phase diagrams \" have similar topology but with some differences due to band dispersions . </S>",
    "<S> we have introduced a quantity which is the generalized current density , using it the current density of each eigen - channel can be calculated in the presence of disorder , giving us a vivid physical picture on how edge states are destroyed . since transmission coefficients of individual eigen - channels for mesoscopic samples can be determined experimentally in the iqhe regime  as we discussed in the paper , our conclusions on how edge states are destroyed by disorder should be testable experimentally .    </S>",
    "<S> we note in passing that how to generalize our results to the large sample limit is an interesting problem requiring further investigation . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , based on the picture of khmelnitskii@xcite and laughlin@xcite , a global phase diagram of quantum hall effect in the @xmath1 plane was proposed by kivelson__et.al__@xcite for large samples which attracted considerable attention both theoretically@xcite and experimentally@xcite . according to it , an integer quantum hall state with a fixed filling factor @xmath88 will _ float up _ in energy as the disorder strength increases@xcite . in the context of _ mesoscopic _ sample </S>",
    "<S> , this idea would mean the following . </S>",
    "<S> consider fermi level @xmath95 , at the mesoscopic sample boundary there are , say , @xmath88 edge states whose eigen - values cut this energy @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> the  </S>",
    "<S> float up \" idea means that when disorder is increased , the energies of edge states increase to higher values , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ they float up . </S>",
    "<S> hence , at large enough disorder there will only be @xmath97 edge states cutting @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> this way , the system undergoes a series of transitions between @xmath88 to @xmath97 states _ </S>",
    "<S> etc._. our results presented above , however , indicate that for mesoscopic samples edge states do not float up by disorder , they are destroyed to become regular transmission eigen - channels which participate transport . </S>"
