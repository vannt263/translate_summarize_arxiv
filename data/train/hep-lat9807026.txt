    "this is , of course , what one would expect based on universality ; the different ensembles simply amount to different discretization of the manifolds and the details of the discretization should be irrelevant in the continuum limit .",
    "this is true even if the triangulations are restricted even further and only minimal curvature fluctuations of @xmath25 are allowed ( including only vertexes of order 5 , 6 and 7 ) @xcite .",
    "but , as mentioned in the introduction , the finite - size effects do depend on the ensemble used , in particular they increase as more restrictions are placed on the triangulations @xcite .",
    "analogous to two dimensions , by imposing the appropriate restrictions in three dimensions i defined the corresponding three different ensembles of triangulations . by allowing distinct but combinatorially equivalent non - degenerate simplexes",
    ", i define an ensemble of restricted degenerate three - dimensional triangulations . compared to combinatorial triangulations , in this ensemble two tetrahedra may be glued together along more than one of their faces .",
    "i show examples of this in figure  [ tri_3da ] .",
    "relaxing these restrictions further and allow degeneracy within the simplexes themselves defines an ensemble of maximally degenerate triangulations - graph .",
    "for a part of the dual graph to be connected to the rest by a single link , the corresponding part of the triangulation would have to be enclosed by a ( closed ) boundary consisting of a single triangle .",
    "this is , however , impossible .",
    "] , @xmath23 this allows , for example , self - loops both in the triangulation and in its dual graph ( a simplex that is its own neighbor ) .",
    "although this type of degenerate triangulations is _ a priori _ well defined , my numerical investigation indicates that this ensemble does not lead to a well defined statistical model .",
    "i tried to simulate the model eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) using maximally degenerate triangulations ; however , in quasi - canonical simulations ( see section",
    "3 ) it was not possible to tune the cosmological constant @xmath14 in such a way that the volume fluctuated around a fixed target volume @xmath26 .",
    "regardless of the value of @xmath14 used , in the course of the simulations the volume eventually exploded .",
    "this behavior suggests that the numbers of maximally degenerate three - dimensional triangulations grows faster than exponentially with the volume , in which case the partition function eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) does not converge . in the rest of this paper",
    "i only consider the ensemble @xmath22 , omitting the specification restricted when referring to it .",
    "having defined degenerate triangulations , a necessary prerequisite for using them in numerical simulations of simplicial gravity is that there exist a set of ergodic geometric moves which allow us to explore the triangulation - space . for combinatorial triangulations",
    "this is provide by the ( @xmath27)moves , a variant of the alexander moves @xcite . in three dimensions the ( @xmath27)moves consist of either inserting or removing a vertex of order four , or replacing a triangle by an edge of order three and vice verse . these moves are depicted in figure  [ movefig ] .",
    "to apply the same set of moves in simulations with degenerate triangulations i have to show that they are also ergodic when applied to the ensemble @xmath28 . to do",
    "so it is sufficient to show that every degenerate triangulation can be changed into a combinatorial triangulation using a finite sequence of the ( @xmath27)moves .",
    "i distinguish among three different types of degeneracy in restricted degenerate triangulations : combinatorially equivalent _ tetrahedra _ , _ triangles _ and _ edges _",
    ", all of which can be eliminate following the appropriate procedures :    = 5.5 in    _ equivalent tetrahedra _ : + in the case of two , or more , tetrahedra defined by the same set of vertexes it is sufficient to insert a vertex ( applying move @xmath29 ) into each of those tetrahedra , this will create a set of combinatorially distinct 3-simplexes .    _ equivalent triangles _ : + given two triangles defined by identical set of vertexes i can apply move @xmath30 to one of them , i.e.   replace that triangle with a new edge . to ensure that the new edge does not result in multiply connected vertexes , and to make sure the move is not rejected by a geometric constraint , prior to using move @xmath30",
    "i can apply move @xmath29 to both of the tetrahedra containing the triangle in question  the new edge now joins two previously unconnected vertexes .    _ equivalent edges _ :",
    "+ it is slightly more complicated to eliminate a par of distinct edges connecting the same two vertexes . to remove an edge",
    "i must apply move @xmath30 , i.e.replace it with a triangle .",
    "this is , however , only possible if the corresponding edge is of order three . to reduce the order of the edge i apply move @xmath30 repeatedly to the neighboring triangles .",
    "it is possible that some of those triangles could be combinatorially identical ; this i eliminate by first applying procedure ( b ) .",
    "the remaining triangles can then safely be replaced until the order of the edge is three .",
    "an additional complication that could arise when restrictions on the triangulations is relaxed is the appearance of _ pseudo - manifolds _ @xcite . in general when gluing @xmath7simplexes together into a closed manifold one does not get a simplicial manifold but a pseudo - manifold .",
    "a simplicial manifold is defined by the additional requirement that the neighborhood of each vertex is homeomorphic to the @xmath7dimensional ball @xmath31 . as this requirement is trivially satisfied for @xmath32 , all degenerate triangulations in two dimensions",
    "are automatically simplicial manifolds .",
    "it is _ a priori _ not clear that in simulating degenerate triangulations in three dimensions , pseudo - manifolds could not be generated  something we would like to avoid .",
    "i observe , however , that in order to generate a pseudo - manifold the ( @xmath27)moves must change the topology of the dual complex to a given vertex @xmath33 in the triangulation . by the dual complex i mean the two - dimensional triangulation constructed by connecting by edges the centers of all adjacent tetrahedra containing @xmath33 .",
    "but as the moves only change the triangulation , hence the dual complex , locally they will not change its topology .",
    "more precisely , when applying a ( @xmath27)move to a three - dimensional triangulation , degenerate or not , the change in the local neighborhood of each of the vertexes involved in the move can be given in terms of the corresponding two - dimensional ( @xmath27)moves ( i.e.  inserting / deleting a vertex or flipping an edge ) applied to its dual complex .",
    "this ensures that the topology of the dual complex is not changed when the move is applied and pseudo - manifolds are not generated .",
    "to study the model eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) i now turn to numerical simulations . as the ( @xmath27)moves in three dimensions do not preserve the volume of the triangulation the simulations can not be restricted to the canonical ensemble , contrary to what is possible in two dimensions .",
    "in addition , fluctuations in the volume are necessary to maintain ergodicity in the updating procedure . in practice",
    "though i perform quasi - canonical monte carlo simulations , with almost fixed @xmath34 , simulating the partition function @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the canonical partition function and the quadratic potential term added to the action ensures , for an appropriate choice of the parameter @xmath37 , the necessary fluctuations around a target volume @xmath26 . in simulating degenerate triangulations",
    "i found @xmath38 to be an appropriate choice . in all cases",
    "i simulate an ensemble of spherical triangulations .    from a practical point of view simulating degenerate triangulations",
    "is actually simpler than simulating combinatorial triangulations . for the latter",
    "the most time - consuming part of the update is the manifold check , i.e.  to verify that there exist no sub - simplex in the triangulation combinatorially equivalent to the one created by the move @xcite . in three dimensions",
    "this check is done both when a triangle is replaced by an edge , and vice verse .",
    "this check is not needed for degenerate triangulation ; the only geometric check that remains is in replacing a triangle by an edge the two tetrahedra involved must only have one triangle in common .",
    "as this check is local the computational effort needed to update a degenerate triangulation is less than for a combinatorial one .",
    "this does not automatically imply that simulations with degenerate triangulations are more efficient .",
    "as the ensemble of degenerate triangulations is much larger the corresponding critical cosmological constant @xmath39 is also larger than for the ensemble of combinatorial triangulations . and as @xmath39 enters the detail balance condition used in the metropolis test this in effect reduces the acceptance rate in the updating procedure . to compare the efficiency of simulating the different ensembles",
    "i must estimate how fast , measured in cpu - time , independent configurations are generated .",
    "i have done this for both ensembles in the crumpled phase , @xmath40 .",
    "i caution , however , that the comparative efficiency will depend on several factors : the particular implementation of the algorithm , how efficiently the manifold checks are executed , the probability of choosing the different moves , and where in the phase - space the simulations are carried out . in the comparison i use the same program for both types of triangulations , turning on and off the manifold checks , and choose the different moves with equal probability .",
    "i measure the cpu - times @xmath41 ( in ms ) it takes to perform one  sweep  through the triangulations ; a sweep is defined as @xmath26 attempted local moves , and the auto - correlation times @xmath42 in units of sweeps , measured for the time - series of the energy - density @xmath43 . combining @xmath41 and @xmath42",
    ", i get an estimate of how fast independent configurations are generated : @xmath44 for small triangulations , @xmath45 , the effective auto - correlations are comparable for the two ensembles , whereas for larger volumes simulating degenerate triangulations is substantially faster .",
    "the real benefit of using degenerate triangulations comes from the reduction in finite - size effects .",
    "this reduction is especially pronounced in the crumpled phase where the internal geometry is dominated by collapsed manifolds . to demonstrate this i measured the volume dependence of the effective critical cosmological constant @xmath46 for @xmath40 and for triangulations of volume @xmath47 .",
    "this i show in figure  [ cosmo ] . for comparison",
    "i include in the figure the corresponding values @xmath48 for combinatorial triangulations .",
    "for both ensembles @xmath49 approaches a finite value @xmath50 as the volume diverges ; this in turn implies that the canonical partition function @xmath51 is exponentially bounded as a function of volume  an necessary condition for the partition function eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) to be convergent .",
    "i have fitted the data to an assumption of a power - law convergence to an exponential bound ( including volumes @xmath52 ) ; this yields : @xmath53 for both ensembles the quality of the fit ( the @xmath54 ) is acceptable .",
    "this can be compared to a fit to a super - exponential growth of @xmath51 , compatible with the assumption @xmath55 , which is definitely ruled out by a very large @xmath56 value .",
    "there is , however , a marked difference in how fast @xmath39 approaches its infinite volume value for those two ensembles .",
    "this is shown in the insert in figure  [ cosmo ] where i plot @xmath57 .",
    "taken at face value , this suggests a reduction of finite - size effects by two orders of magnitude when using degenerate rather than combinatorial triangulations .",
    "this huge reduction is though presumable only achieved in the crumpled phase where collapsed manifolds dominate the partition function and the geometric finite - size effects are most pronounced .",
    "i now turn to the existence of a phase transition in the model as the inverse newton s constant @xmath15 is varied . for combinatorial triangulations it is well established by numerical simulations that the model eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) has a discontinuous phase transition at @xmath16 , separating a strong - coupling ( small @xmath15 ) crumpled phase from a weak - coupling branched polymer phase @xcite .",
    "as i will demonstrate in this section this is also the case for degenerate triangulations ; moreover , the discontinuous nature of the transition is easily observed on triangulations of relatively modest size .",
    "i have simulated the model eq .",
    "( [ quasi ] ) for target volumes @xmath58 to 6400 , and for each volume i search for a phase transition in the fluctuations of the energy - density @xmath43 . a signal for",
    "a transition would be a peak in the specific heat : @xmath59 this is shown in figure  [ cv_n0 ] for different target volumes .",
    "i did simulations at few values of @xmath15 around the observed peaks , collecting between two and ten thousand independent measurements , and then used standard multi - histogram methods to interpolate between the measurements .",
    "the interpolations is shown as solid lines in figure  [ cv_n0 ] , the dashed lines indicate the errors .    to infer about the nature of the transition i look at the energy - density distribution @xmath60 . for sufficiently large target volume",
    "this distribution has a well resolved double - peak structure , indicating a discontinuous phase transition .",
    "this double - peak structure is observed already on volumes @xmath61 .",
    "i show an example of the measured energy distributions in figure  [ rho_n0 ] ( thin lines ) for the three largest volumes i studied , together with fits to a form composed of two gaussian peaks ( thick lines ) : @xmath62 each distribution is normalized by the height of the peaks and the value of @xmath15 is chosen so that the two peaks are of equal height .",
    "additional evidence for a phase transition comes from other geometric observables such as the maximal order of a vertex , @xmath63 .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the crumpled phase is dominated by triangulations containing few vertexes of very large order , whereas in a branched polymer phase the vertex orders are more or less equally distributed .",
    "this is reflected in a sudden drop in the maximal vertex order across the transition ; this change leads to divergent peaks in both the fluctuations of @xmath63 , i.e.  the susceptibility @xmath64 , and its energy derivative @xmath65 .",
    "in fact , plots of both @xmath66 and @xmath67 look more or less identical to figure  [ cv_n0 ] .",
    "for all the observables the peak heights diverge , an example of this is shown in figure  [ cv_peak ] for the specific heat .",
    "i have estimated the corresponding scaling behavior , fitting the peak values to the form : @xmath68 ; the fitted scaling exponents are shown in table  1 . compared to @xmath66 and @xmath67 , the fit of the specific heat is rendered considerable more difficult by an additional constant contribution to the scaling behavior .",
    "nevertheless , for the specific heat the peak height scales almost linearly for sufficiently large target volume as is expected for a discontinuous phase transition .    to locate the infinite volume critical coupling @xmath69",
    "i fit the pseudo - critical couplings @xmath70 , defined by the location of peaks in the different observables , to the expected finite - volume scaling behavior : @xmath71 the fitted values of @xmath69 and the exponent @xmath72 are shown in table  1 . to asses",
    "the finite - size effects i repeated the fits with a different lower cut - off on the included target volume .",
    "this did not affect the estimate of @xmath69 appreciatively ; in all cases @xmath73 .",
    "note however that , in contrast to what has recently been reported in simulations with combinatorial triangulations @xcite , i observe no indication of the peak locations running to @xmath74 .",
    "for all the observables the pseudo - critical couplings converge nicely .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ kap_c ] .",
    "a fit to an assumption of non - convergence , @xmath75 , is ruled out by a @xmath76 . for the scaling exponent @xmath72 , i get values @xmath77 . for a discontinuous phase transition one would naively expect @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is some appropriate length scale in the system and @xmath80",
    "is the ( internal ) fractal dimension ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "this would imply @xmath81 in eq .",
    "( [ coupscal ] ) .",
    "however , for a system with a fluctuating internal geometry like simplicial gravity , it is not clear what dimensionality should be associated to the system at a discontinuous phase transition where in one phase the internal fractal dimension is infinite , but two in the other . hence it is not obvious how to interpret the observed value of the exponent @xmath72 .",

    "( [ model ] ) is a crumpled phase , characterized by few vertexes of very large order .",
    "qualitatively i observe this behavior regardless of the type of triangulations i simulated .",
    "note , however , that there is _ a priori _ no reason to expect exactly the same behavior for the two ensembles in this phase ; because of the collapsed nature of manifolds it is unlikely that any sensible continuum limit can be taken for @xmath82 .",
    "hence the details of the triangulations  the discretization  may be relevant in the infinite volume limit .",
    "there does indeed appear to be some slight difference in the internal geometry of the ensemble of degenerate triangulations , compared to the combinatorial ensemble , for @xmath40 .",
    "an example of this is the scaling behavior of the effective critical cosmological constant determined in section  3 . for combinatorial triangulations",

    "the geodesic distance between two simplexes is defined as the shortest path traversed through the center of simplexes .",

    "provided it yields a well defined statistical model , does not seem to change the phase structure of the model ; i still observe a crumpled and a branched polymer phase , separated by a discontinuous phase transition .",
    "there is , however , evidence of less finite - size effects in the model , especially in the crumpled phase where the critical cosmological constant approaches much faster its infinite volume value . as a consequence , an exponential bound on the number of degenerate triangulations of a given volume",
    "is more easily established than for the corresponding ensemble of combinatorial triangulations .",
    "this reduction in finite - size effects in the crumpled phase is intuitively clear ; with less restrictions on the connectivity of the simplexes the degenerate triangulations crumple more easily .",
    "in addition , the discontinuous nature of the phase transition is easily observed on triangulations of relatively modest size .",
    "a natural extension of the work presented in this paper is to add a measure term @xcite , or alternatively matter fields @xcite , to the action eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) and to investigate if the phase structure of the model is modified in the same way as has recently been observed in simulations with combinatorial triangulations in both four @xcite and three dimensions @xcite .",
    "there a new phase  a _ crinkled _ phase  appears for a sufficiently large negative coupling to the measure term , or if several matter fields are coupled to the model . if this phase structure does indeed represent some behavior of the continuum it is plausible , based on the expectation of universality , that it should not depend on the details of the discretization and",
    "should also be present for degenerate triangulations .",
    "thus corresponding simulations of modified models of three - dimensional simplicial gravity using degenerate triangulations could serve as a confirmation on the observed phase structure .",
    "this work is in progress .",
    "although the result of my numerical investigation of maximally degenerate three - dimensional triangulations indicated that this ensemble does not lead to a well defined statistical model , i do not rule out the possibility that a less restricted ensemble of triangulations , than considered in this paper , could be used .",
    "the challenge is to identify an appropriate easing of the restriction which defines a consistent , exponentially bounded , canonical ensemble . with the potential benefits provided by an even larger ensemble than restricted degenerate triangulations this is definitely worth investigating .",
