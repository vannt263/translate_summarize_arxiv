    "the roots of optimal transport as a mathematical field go back to monge @xcite and kantorovich @xcite who established its modern formulation .",
    "more recently it experienced a steep development prompted by brenier s theorem @xcite and the milestone phd - thesis of mccann @xcite .",
    "the field is now famous for its striking applications in areas ranging from mathematical physics and pde - theory to geometric and functional inequalities .",
    "we refer to @xcite for recent accounts of the theory .",
    "very recently there has also been interest in optimal transport problems where the transport plan must satisfy additional martingale constraints .",
    "such problems arise naturally in robust finance , but are also of independent mathematical interest , for example  mirroring classical optimal transport  they have important consequences for the study of martingale inequalities ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "early papers to investigate such problems include @xcite , and this topic is commonly referred to as martingale optimal transport . in mathematical finance , transport techniques",
    "complement the skorokhod embedding approach to model - independent / robust finance ( we refer to @xcite for an overview , see @xcite for a link with optimal transport theory ) .    in view of the central role taken by brenier s theorem in optimal transport ,",
    "it is an intriguing question to obtain an analogous result also in the martingale setup . in this direction , @xcite have proposed a martingale version of brenier s monotone transport mapping .    under certain structural properties of the underlying probability distributions ,",
    "it was established in @xcite that the monotone martingale transport plan solves the given variational problem for all coupling functions satisfying the _ spence - mirrlees _ condition . in the present paper",
    "we show that this is in fact true for general continuous distributions @xmath0 .",
    "a basic fundamental result is that the monotone martingale transport plan is _",
    "unique_. however the original derivation ( @xcite ) is intricate and relies on subtle properties of potential functions and a delicate approximation procedure .",
    "we provide a short conceptual proof of this result .",
    "this is based on a new connection with the classical skorokhod embedding problem which may be of independent interest .",
    "on the canonical space @xmath1 , we denote by @xmath2 the canonical process , i.e. @xmath3 and @xmath4 for all @xmath5 .",
    "we also denote by @xmath6 and @xmath7 the collection of all probability measures on @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively . for fixed @xmath10 with finite first moments ,",

    "should be compared to the situation in standard optimal transport problem , where the frchet - hoeffding coupling defines a transport plan concentrated on a graph which solves simultaneously the monge and the kantorovitch problem .",
    "clearly , one can not expect that martingale transport maps be concentrated on one single graph , as this would imply that the martingale is deterministic , and therefore constant which can happen only in the degenerate case @xmath88 .",

    ", we use that a left - monotone martingale transport plan gives rise to a particular solution of the skorokhod embedding problem : for measures @xmath78 , @xmath97 in convex order the skorokhod problem is to construct a stopping time @xmath98 such for a brownian motion started in @xmath99 , the distribution of @xmath100 equals @xmath97 .",
