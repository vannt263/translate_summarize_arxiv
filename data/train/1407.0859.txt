    "the fourier heat conduction law is an empirical law that describes how the heat current is sustained by the temperature gradient , i.e. , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the heat current , @xmath2 is the temperature gradient , and @xmath3 is known as the thermal conductivity , which is a finite constant independent of the system size .",
    "however , not all systems obey the fourier law .",
    "it is known that the transport properties are strongly affected by conservation laws  @xcite . in the extreme case that a system is integrable , the heat conductivity is a linear function of the system size . even in the particular case",
    "in which the total momentum is the only conserved quantity , the heat conductivity may diverge as well . in particular , in one-dimensional ( 1d ) and two-dimensional ( 2d ) cases , since 1970 when alder and wainwright reported their findings  @xcite , it has been realized that momentum conservation may lead to slow decay of time correlations so that transport is not diffusive and is characterized by diverging transport coefficients . for 1d momentum-conserving systems ,",
    "the heat conductivity generally depends on the system size @xmath4 in a power-law manner : @xmath5 .",
    "there is no general consensus on the numerical value of @xmath6 and different theoretical models predict that @xmath6 is @xmath7 if the interparticle interaction is symmetric and @xmath8 otherwise  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that these theoretical predictions equally apply to both fluids and lattices . on the other hand , a recent numerical study  @xcite suggested that when the interparticle interactions are asymmetric , there is a significant difference between fluids and lattices . to summarize , for 1d systems",
    ", the heat conduction properties are believed to depend on integrability , momentum-conservation , interaction symmetry , and the nature of fluids or lattices .",
    "for the particular case of 1d momentum-conserving systems , which is the subject of the present paper , all analytical and numerical results so far available do not allow one to draw definite conclusions yet .",
    "this problem was analyzed with various 1d models in a recent study  @xcite , where it was shown that the fermi-pasta-ulam ( fpu ) chain with symmetric or asymmetric potential exhibits anomalous heat transport , which is consistent with other recent investigations  @xcite .",
    "the plateau in the system size dependence of the heat conductivity found in  @xcite for the fpu model with a certain set of parameters turns out to be a finite size effect and , at larger @xmath4 , the heat conductivity starts increasing again .",
    "in particular in  @xcite it was surmised that the value @xmath8 should be found asymptotically for very large system size , even though , in fact , a value of the exponent @xmath9 was numerically found ( up to @xmath10 ) .",
    "the results of  @xcite also led to an exponent @xmath11 for the asymmetric fpu chain . in  @xcite ,",
    "the value 1/3 was found for the same fpu model but in a different parameter range and for high temperatures . in the same paper ,",
    "the possibility of a finite temperature phase transition was not ruled out . finally , in  @xcite normal heat conductivity",
    "was reported for 1d momentum-conserving systems with the lennard-jones , morse , and coulomb potential .",
    "the overall picture is therefore far from being clear .",
    "_ rebus sic stantibus _ , in order to gain a better understanding in such a complex situation , it might be convenient to consider the 1d diatomic hard-point gas .",
    "indeed , this is a clean and simple system of billiard type and , as such , it should reflect general properties since billiards have been found fundamental in understanding both classical and quantum dynamical systems .",
    "moreover , an important feature of billiard-type systems is that their dynamical properties do not depend on the temperature , which makes their analysis even more simplified . by analyzing the hard-point gas ,",
    "we show that close to the integrable , equal masses limit , the system exhibits normal heat conduction over longer and longer sizes as the integrable limit is approached .",
    "asymptotically , however , the power law divergence of the thermal conductivity sets in with the power 1/3 . to be more precise , we can not exclude the possibility of a phase transition as the mass ratio is increased ; however , our numerical evidence suggests that this possibility should be quite unlikely .",
    "the analysis of the diatomic toda lattice confirm these conclusions .",
    "these results lead us to speculate that as one approaches the integrable limit , anomalous behavior is perhaps more general than so far expected  @xcite even though it might be hard to detect in numerical simulations .",
    "after being initially proposed in 1986  @xcite , the 1d diatomic gas model has attracted increasing interest for investigating various aspects of 1d transport .",
    "the model consists of @xmath4 hard-core point particles in one dimension with alternative mass @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( for odd- and even-numbered particles , respectively ) .",
    "we fix the averaged particle number density to be unity so that @xmath4 refers to the length of the system as well . in order to measure the heat conductivity , two statistical thermal baths with different temperatures @xmath14 and @xmath15",
    "are put into contact with the left and the right end of the system . when the first ( last ) particle collides with the left ( right ) side of the system , it is injected back with a new speed @xmath16 determined by the distribution  @xcite @xmath17 here @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the masses of the first and the last particle and @xmath20 is the boltzmann constant which is set to be unity throughout .    in our simulations ,",
    "each particle is given initially a random position uniformly distributed and a random velocity according to the boltzmann distribution with temperature @xmath21 ( @xmath22 is the position of the @xmath23th particle ) .",
    "then the system is evolved by using an effective event-driven algorithm  @xcite . after the system reaches the steady state ,",
    "we compute the steady heat flux @xmath1 that crosses the system ; i.e. , the averaged energy exchanged in the unit time between a boundary particle and the heat bath , or that between any two neighboring particles",
    ". the heat conductivity is then measured , by assuming the fourier law , as @xmath24 .",
    "we set @xmath25 and @xmath26 so that the nominal temperature of the system is @xmath27 .",
    "the heat conductivity at any other temperature @xmath28 can be obtained through the scaling relation @xmath29 .",
    "we will focus on how the heat conductivity @xmath3 depends on the system size @xmath4 and on the mass ratio @xmath30 ( hereafter we set @xmath31 ) .",
    "we emphasize that in our simulations , long enough integration times ( @xmath32 ) have been taken so that the relative errors of all the measured values of @xmath3 are less than @xmath33 .",
    "now let us turn to the simulations results .",

    "this can be considered as a numerical test .",
    "now , we change the mass ratio to make it slightly larger than one [ see fig .",
    "1(a ) ] ; it can be seen that for small @xmath4 ( @xmath35 ) , @xmath3 follows its integrable limit case , but as @xmath4 is increased further , @xmath3 tends to saturate and becomes constant for @xmath36 .",
    "this could be taken as an empirical demonstration that at least for these mass ratios and for large enough system size , heat conduction is governed by the fourier law , which is in clear contrast with existing theoretical and numerical predictions .",

    "based on the green-kubo formula , which relates transport coefficients to the current time-correlation functions , the heat conductivity of a 1d finite system can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath44 in this formula , @xmath45 represents the total heat current and @xmath46 is its correlation function measured in the equilibrium state with the periodic boundary condition .",

    "2(a ) that for a large system ( @xmath36 ) , the correlation function changes slowly at short times ( @xmath61 ) , which reflects the fact that the system still mimics its integrable limit ; however , from @xmath62 to @xmath63 , the correlation function undergoes a rapid decay and eventually , when @xmath64 , it begins to oscillate around zero .",

    "it can be seen that @xmath65 agrees with @xmath3 despite some deviations at small @xmath4 .",
    "next we consider the dependence on the mass ratio . by using the same nonequilibrium setting",
    "we have extensively investigated the system size dependence of @xmath3 for the mass ratio ranging from 1.07 to 64 .",
    "the results for @xmath66 are shown in fig .",
    "a three-stage process can be recognized : for small system sizes @xmath67 , similar to the integrable case . for large system sizes",
    ", @xmath3 shows a tendency to @xmath68 . in between these two regimes",
    ", there appears an intermediate , bridging regime , where @xmath3 changes at a lower rate ( see particularly the cases of @xmath69 and @xmath54 ) .",
    "actually , in this intermediate regime , as @xmath12 is decreased , the conductivity @xmath3 tends to be constant over a larger and larger interval . for @xmath70 instead",
    "( data not shown here ) the dependence @xmath71 appears more and more clearly in agreement with the existing theories  @xcite . in order to better understand the dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath4 , along each curve provided in fig .",
    "3(a ) we computed its tangent @xmath72 and plot the results in fig .",
    "note that @xmath72 exhibits a non-monotonic behavior and reaches a minimum at a certain system size @xmath58 .",
    "interestingly enough , the value of @xmath58 appear to grow very fast with decreasing @xmath12 [ see the inset in fig .",
    "this result shows that a very small tangent @xmath6 , i.e. , a fourier-like behavior of thermal conduction , can be observed over an increasingly large system size when the integrable limit is approached . at the same time , for @xmath73 , anomalous behavior emerges gradually .",
    "the conclusion is that for any mass ratio different from unity the behavior @xmath74 seems to always take place even though it can not be detected numerically when the mass ratio approaches unity since in this limit @xmath58 becomes exceedingly large . on the other hand , based on our available data ,",

    "the above described scenario in which the fourier law appears in the `` vicinity '' of the integrable limit is not exclusive of the gas model . in the following",
    "we show that it is also the case for lattices .",
    "the model we consider here is a diatomic variant of the toda lattice  @xcite with the hamiltonian @xmath84,\\ ] ] where the potential is @xmath85 , and the particles take masses @xmath12 and @xmath31 alternatively . as for the gas model , this system is integrable when the mass ratio is one .",
    "we measure the heat conductivity in both the nonequilibrium and equilibrium settings again , and find that the results turn out to agree with each other . in the nonequilibrium simulations , we couple the system to two langevin heat baths  @xcite with the temperature @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the heat current is defined as @xmath88 with @xmath89  @xcite . in fig .",
    "4(a ) the measured @xmath3 for different values of @xmath12 is given .",
    "again , for mass ratios close to unity , @xmath3 is close to the integrable case when the system is small ( @xmath90 ) but tends to a value which agrees with that obtained by using the green-kubo formula for the large system s size ( @xmath36 ) . for larger mass ratio ( see the case of @xmath79 )",
    "the heat conductivity is anomalous .",
    "similarly to the hard - point gas model , the tangent @xmath72 exhibits a nonmonotonic behavior , with the minimum reached at a system size @xmath91 rapidly growing when the integrable limit @xmath92 is approached [ see fig .",
    "4(b ) ] . with regard to the equilibrium simulations ,",
    "we assume periodic boundary conditions , null total momentum and total energy corresponding to @xmath93 .",
    "the total heat current is @xmath94 and its correlation function for @xmath95 is shown in fig .",
    "4(c ) , where it exhibits a faster than @xmath83 decay as expected in the case of normal heat conduction .",
    "the overall emerging picture is the same as presented above for the gas model .",
    "this similarity is unlikely a coincidence due to the contrasting difference in the dynamics of the two systems ; rather , it strongly suggests some general mechanisms in the heat conduction properties as one departs from the integrable limit .",
    "we have shown that in two 1d momentum-conserving paradigmatic systems , the heat conductivity can be independent of the system size over a considerably wide range .",
    "such a fourier-like behavior appears as a quite general feature for lattice or gas models close to the integrable limit .",
    "apart from theoretical implications in transport theory , our finding may have experimental relevance as well , because the system size over which the heat conductivity keeps constant , grows very fast as the system approaches its integrable limit .",
    "our present understanding of the heat conduction problem is mainly based on numerical empirical evidence while rigorous analytical results are hard to obtain .",
    "numerical analysis consists of steady - state , nonequilibrium simulations or of equilibrium simulations based on linear response theory and the green-kubo formula .",
    "if both methods give reasonable evidence for the fourier law and if , moreover , they lead to the same numerical value of the heat conductivity @xmath3 , then this has been generally considered as a conclusive evidence that the fourier law is valid .",
    "this conclusion , however , could not be correct . as we have shown in this paper , the agreement between equilibrium and nonequilibrium simulations does not allow , _ per se _ , to draw any definite conclusion .",
    "indeed this agreement might be a finite size effect and the fourier law may appear to hold up to some system size @xmath4 after which anomalous behavior sets in .",
    "the main point is that we have no indications at all about the critical value of @xmath4 after which conductivity becomes anomalous .",
    "what we know from the numerical analysis of this paper is that this critical value seems to diverge rapidly as one approaches the integrable limit .",
    "this result is quite surprising to us and it is a feature which we do not understand yet . while it is natural to expect an initial ballistic behavior for larger and larger system sizes as one approaches the integrable limit , it is absolutely not clear why the value of @xmath3 appears to saturate to a constant value and why this fourier-like behavior may persist in an increasingly wide range of the system size before entering the anomalous regime .",
