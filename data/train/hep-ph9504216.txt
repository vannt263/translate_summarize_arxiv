    "the existence of heavy neutral ( @xmath0 ) and/or charged ( @xmath1 ) vector bosons are a feature of many extensions of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "they arise in extended gauge theories including grand unified theories @xcite , superstring theories @xcite , and left - right symmetric models @xcite and in other models such as the bess model @xcite and models of composite gauge bosons @xcite .    in this report",
    "we survey and compare the discovery potential of the experiments that will be performed over the next decade ( tevatron , hera , and lep200 ) and future facilities that are being planned and considered for the period beyond ( various tevatron upgrades , the lhc @xmath7 collider , the lsgna 60  tev @xmath7 collider , the nlc @xmath8 collider , and the lep - lhc @xmath9 collider ) .",
    "in addition to the discovery reach of each of the experimental facilities we also address the auxiliary question ; that of the measurement of the properties of a newly discovered gauge boson and therefore its identification in the context of a specific model . we therefore examine the diagnostic power of future colliders for heavy gauge boson physics , in particular , a ( model independent ) determination of heavy gauge boson couplings to quarks and leptons .    in the next section",
    "we give a brief description of the various models with new gauge bosons that will be used in the study . given that models without gauge invariance will most likely reveal themselves in ways other than the discovery of extra gauge bosons , we will restrict our analysis to heavy gauge bosons that arise in models with extended gauge symmetries . in section 3",
    "we summarize current constraints on heavy gauge bosons . in section 4",
    "we describe the signatures of extra gauge bosons at future hadron and @xmath8 colliders and the resulting discovery reaches . in section 5",
    "we address the diagnostic power ( identification potential ) for heavy gauge boson physics at the lhc and the nlc , respectively .",
    "conclusions are given in section 6 .",
    "there is a large and growing literature on this subject of which we address only some aspects . our primary goal is to explore the potential of experimental facilities for extra gauge bosons physics over the next decade and beyond .",
    "the emphasis is on comparing the discovery limits as well as the diagnostic power of the different facilities .",
    "other useful reviews which address related topics , some of them in more detail , are : hewett and rizzo @xcite , hewett @xcite , cveti , del aguila and langacker @xcite , and del aguila @xcite .",
    "in this section we briefly describe some of the extended gauge theories which have been studied in the literature . while not totally comprehensive , the properties are representative of models with extra gauge bosons .",
    "the largest set of extended gauge theories are those which are based on guts @xcite .",
    "popular examples are the groups @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "generically , additional @xmath12-bosons originating from @xmath11 grand unified theories are conveniently labeled in terms of the chain @xmath13 where @xmath14 remains unbroken at low energies .",
    "thus , the @xmath0 charges are given by linear combinations of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 charges resulting in the @xmath0-fermion couplings : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a free parameter which lies in the range @xmath19 , @xmath20 ( here we assume the equality ) , @xmath21/2\\sqrt{6}$ ] , and @xmath22/$ ] @xmath23 for @xmath24 $ ] , the left - handed fermions in the * 10 * , @xmath25 , and * 1 * of @xmath26 contained in the usual * 16 * of @xmath10",
    ". special cases of interest are model @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) corresponding to the extra @xmath0 of @xmath10 , model @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) corresponding to the extra @xmath0 of @xmath11 , and model @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) corresponding to the extra @xmath0 arising in some superstring theories @xcite .",
    "@xmath10 guts lead to intermediate symmetries , for example ; @xmath33 the first chain leads to the additional @xmath12-boson , @xmath34 , mentioned above , while the second chain yields the left - right symmetric model ( lrm ) which extends the standard model gauge group to @xmath35 @xcite with a right - handed charged boson as well as an additional neutral current .",
    "the @xmath0-fermion coupling is given by @xmath36\\ ] ] with @xmath37 @xcite , @xmath38 the isospin assignments of the fermions under @xmath39 , @xmath40 the fermion electric charge and @xmath41 .",
    "we assume @xmath42 in our analysis which corresponds to manifest left - right symmetric gauge interactions .",
    "note that the @xmath43 assignments are the same as in the standard model while the values of @xmath44 for @xmath45 and are zero for left - handed doublets .",
    "another extended model based on the second intermediate group is the alternative left - right model ( alrm ) which originates from @xmath11 gut s and is also based on the electroweak gauge group @xmath35 @xcite . here",
    "the assignments for @xmath38 differ from those of the usual lrm for @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 with @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "the lrm and alrm have identical @xmath52-quark , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 couplings . in this model",
    "the right handed @xmath55-boson carries lepton number and has odd r - parity avoiding the usual constraints on the mass of right handed @xmath55 s .",
    "the `` sequential '' standard model ( ssm ) consists of a @xmath0 with the same couplings as the sm @xmath56 boson couplings .",
    "although it is not a gauge invariant model it is often used for purposes of comparison .",
    "the un - unified standard model ( unsm ) @xcite is based on the gauge group @xmath57 , i.e. , left - handed leptons ( quarks ) transform as doublets under @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) and singlets under @xmath59 ( @xmath58 ) , and right - handed fields are singlets under both groups .",
    "the @xmath0-fermion coupling takes the form @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the third component of @xmath62-isospin , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 is a mixing parameter which lies in the range @xmath65 .",
    "we take @xmath66 in our calculations .",
    "the @xmath0 is purely left handed in this model .",
    "there are numerous other models predicting @xmath0 s in the literature @xcite but the subset described above has properties representative of the broad class of models , at least for the purposes of comparing discovery limits at high energy colliders .    in all of the above models the @xmath67 mass matrix takes the form @xmath68 where @xmath69 is determined within each model once the higgs sector is specified .",
    "the physical eigenstates are then @xmath70 where @xmath71 is currently being probed at lep and @xmath72 .",
    "lep measurements constrain @xmath73 @xcite which is smaller than could be observed at high energy collider experiments . without loss of generality",
    "we will therefore ignore @xmath67 mixing in the remainder of this review .",
    "in this report we will also assume that the branching ratios include decays into only _ three ordinary families_.",
    "before proceeding to future colliders it is useful to list existing bounds as a benchmark against which to measure future experiments",
    ". constraints can be placed on the existence of @xmath0 s either indirectly from fits to high precision electroweak data @xcite@xcite or from direct searches at operating collider facilities @xcite .",
    "there have been a number of fits to precision data @xcite .",
    "we list results of langacker @xcite in table [ cvetictab1 ] which includes the most recent ( 1993 ) lep data and is an update of the global analysis of electro - weak data described in ref . @xcite .",
    "two sets of results are presented ; an unconstrained fit with no assumptions on the higgs sector , and a constrained fit with specific assumptions on the higgs sector and therefore the @xmath74 mixing angle .",
    "the highest mass limits come from direct searches by the cdf experiment at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "the cdf limits are obtained by looking for high invariant mass lepton pairs that would result from drell - yan production of @xmath0s and @xmath1s @xcite and their subsequent decay to lepton pairs ; @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the most recent cdf 95 % confidence level results based on @xmath77 are listed in table [ cvetictab1 ] .",
    "the next run with @xmath78  pb@xmath79 will increase the discovery reach by roughly 100 gev .",
    "the direct tevatron bounds on @xmath80 ( for the main production channel @xmath81 ) are in the 600 gev region , while indirect constrained [ unconstrained ] bounds are in the 1.4 tev [ 300 gev ] region",
    ".    =    .5pc    .",
    "current constraints on @xmath82 ( in gev ) for typical models from direct production at the tevatron ( @xmath83 pb@xmath79 ) , as well as indirect limits from a global electro - weak analysis ( 95% c.l . )",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     in fig .",
    "6 we plot 90%  confidence level @xmath84 regions for the @xmath85 and @xmath86 models as @xmath87 versus @xmath88 versus @xmath89 at the @xmath90 .",
    "while the error - bars are small , the figure displays a few - fold ambiguity for the value of the couplings ( [ coup ] ) ( additional ambiguities are off the scale of the plot ) . at the nlc",
    "the error - bars are on the average larger , but the ambiguity in the value of the couplings is now removed .",
    "thus , the lhc and the nlc are complementary and together have the potential to uniquely determine the couplings with small error - bars .",
    "finally , we would also like to point out that the determination of @xmath0 couplings to quarks and leptons would in turn allow the determination of the nature of the underlying extended gauge structure @xcite . as a prime example one can choose the @xmath11 group . in this case",
    "two discrete constraints on experimentally determined couplings have to be satisfied .",
    "if so , the couplings would then uniquely determine the two parameters , @xmath18 and @xmath91 , which fully specify the nature of the @xmath0 within @xmath11 .",
    "if the @xmath0 is part of the @xmath11 gauge structure , then for @xmath92 tev @xmath18 and @xmath91 could be determined to around @xmath93 at the future colliders .",
    "in particular , one would be able to separate the @xmath94 symmetry breaking chains from the @xmath95 chains .",
    "the nlc provides a unique determination of the two constraints as well as of @xmath18 and @xmath91 , though with slightly larger error bars than at the lhc . on the other hand ,",
    "since the lhc primarily determines three out of four normalized couplings , it provides weaker constraints for the underlying gauge structure . for more details",
    "@xcite .",
    "among the facilities operating in the up - coming decade tevatron offers the highest discovery reach for new heavy gauge bosons with masses up to 700900 gev range .    in the longer term , future hadron colliders , _",
    "i.e. _ , different upgraded versions of the tevatron and the lhc , as well as a high luminosity @xmath8 collider , _",
    "i.e. _ , the nlc , would significantly improve limits on the heavy gauge boson masses .",
    "for the typical models such limits are in the 12 tev region for the tevatron upgrades , in the 45 tev region for the lhc , and roughly 2 - 10@xmath96 for the nlc with 50  fb@xmath79 .",
    "the lhc and a high luminosity 500 gev @xmath8 collider have discovery limits for @xmath0 which are in many cases comparable . both facilities have strengths and weakness .",
    "the limits obtained from the lhc are robust , in the sense that they are obtained from a direct measurement with little background , but the sensitivity is dependent on the total width of the @xmath0 , which depends on assumptions of the particle content of the model .",
    "limits obtained for the nlc are indirect , based on statistical deviations from the standard model , and are therefore more sensitive to having the systematic errors under control .",
    "however , they do not depend on the unknown particle content of the model . with these caveats",
    "we would still consider , for the purposes of discovering extra gauge bosons , the lhc to be the machine of choice .",
    "we have also explored the diagnostic power of the lhc and the nlc for a model independent determination of @xmath0 couplings to quarks and leptons , once a @xmath0 is discovered .",
    "in addition , the determination of such @xmath0 couplings would in turn allow one to determine the nature of the underlying extended gauge structure . at the nlc ,",
    "efficient heavy flavor tagging and longitudinal polarization of the electron beam provide probes in the two - fermion final state channels , which are sensitive to the magnitude as well as the relative signs of _ all _ the @xmath0 charges to quarks and leptons . for @xmath97 1 tev , such couplings would be determined to about 1020 % for a class of typical models .",
    "if polarization were not available , the determination of the @xmath0 couplings would be marginal , since the error - bars increase by a factor of 210 . without heavy flavor tagging very little",
    "can be learned about the quark couplings .",
    "the lhc is complementary in nature ; while it primarily allows for the determination of the magnitude of only three out of four normalized couplings , the corresponding errors are typically a factor of @xmath32 smaller than those for the nlc for typical models with @xmath92 tev . in addition , the lhc would measure @xmath82 directly and would allow for a determination of an overall strength of the @xmath0 gauge coupling to fermions .",
    "this is in contrast to the nlc which , for the fixed c.m .",
    "energy , primarily determines only the ratio of an overall @xmath0 gauge coupling strength and @xmath82 .",
    "the two machines possess complementary diagnostic power for the model independent determination of the @xmath0 couplings to quarks and leptons . in conjunction , they allow for determination of the @xmath82 , an overall @xmath0 gauge coupling strength as well as a unique determination of _ all _ the quark and lepton charges with error bars in the 1020% range , provided @xmath982 tev .",
    "in addition , at the lhc @xmath1 diagnostics is possible for @xmath992 tev .",
    "a final observation is that if the di - tevatron were running prior to turning on of the lhc , the non discovery of an extra gauge boson at the di - tevatron would imply that the @xmath0 is too heavy to allow for diagnostic study of its properties at the lhc and/or the nlc .",
