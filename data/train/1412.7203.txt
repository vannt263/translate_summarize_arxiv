    "homogeneous cosmological models have successfully explained many important features of our universe .",
    "however , we know that the distribution of matter is not homogeneous and so these models are only an approximation . in the last decade modelling of inhomogeneity in cosmology",
    "has become a topic of substantial interest .",
    "there are several different approaches to the problem . due to the nonlinear nature of einstein equations one should not rely on perturbation theory completely therefore exact models with nonuniform distribution of matter",
    "should be considered as well . among",
    "the most studied exact inhomogeneous solutions of einstein equations belong lemaitre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) metric @xcite , szekeres solution @xcite , szafron family of solutions @xcite , stephani solution @xcite or lemaitre metric @xcite , which is a generalization of ltb for a fluid with nonzero pressure .",
    "an overview of inhomogeneous cosmological solutions can be found in @xcite .",
    "ltb metric was extensively studied by krasinski and hellaby to model structure formation @xcite - @xcite .",
    "together with bolejko they used the solution to describe formation of voids in the universe @xcite .",
    "ltb metric is a special case of the szekeres solution that was discovered by szekeres @xcite and was developed by hellaby and krasinski in a series of papers @xcite - @xcite .",
    "they gave a geometrical interpretation of the metric functions in all three different types of geometry that are quasi - spherical , quasi - pseudospherical and quasi - planar .",
    "the quasi - spherical case is currently the best understood of all three types .",
    "it has found a cosmological application in the study of bolejko who focused on structure formation @xcite , @xcite and constructed models of a void with an adjourning supercluster .",
    "bolejko also investigated buchert averaging of the quasispherical szekeres metric @xcite , constructed a szekeres - swiss - cheese model that he used to estimate the impact of inhomogeneity on the propagation of light @xcite and cmb observations @xcite .",
    "walters and hellaby showed in a recent paper @xcite how to model inhomogeneity in quasispherical szekeres metric using initial and final data .",
    "they constructed three models where they specified initial and final radial density profile and one extreme value of the density on the final time slice in terms of a deviation function along with the position of the extreme . in this way they set up all 5 degrees of freedom in",
    "the szekeres metric and worked out an algorithm to calculate all other metric functions in the model .    for practical purposes",
    "it would be desirable to consider the evolution of inhomogeneities in szekeres spacetime determined only by initial data . in our approach",
    "we specify the curvature function @xmath2 and the radial density profile with one extreme value at the initial time .",
    "thus we set up only 3 degrees of freedom which is however sufficient to model the density contrast .",
    "to make an appropriate choice for the initial density extreme we investigate the shell crossing conditions in terms of the density extremes and show that the resulting constraints are preserved throughout the evolution ( for the assumed value of @xmath2 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we give an overview of the szekeres metric and describe its basic properties . in section 3",
    "we derive conditions that the density extremes have to satisfy in order to avoid a shell crossing singularity . in section 4",
    "we show that if these conditions are met at the initial time , then they are fulfilled at later times if the curvature function vanishes . in section 5",
    "we derive an analytical formula for the density contrast defined as the difference of the extreme values and for the case @xmath3 we show that if the initial radial inhomogeneity is small , then the density contrast is proportional to @xmath4 and the radial dependence of the function does not evolve substantially in time . in section 6 we set up the model by specifying two more functions and show the time evolution of the density contrast in a specific example .",
    "we conclude in section 7 .",
    "the szekeres spacetime is an exact dust solution of einstein equations without any symmetries .",
    "it was found by szekeres @xcite and generalized by szafron @xcite for an energy momentum tensor describing a perfect fluid .",
    "the lt type of szekeres metric can be written as @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6,\\ ] ] @xmath7-\\frac{p'}{s}\\left(p - p\\right)-\\frac{q'}{s}\\left(q - q\\right)\\ ] ] and @xmath2 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 are arbitrary functions of @xmath1 .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 can have only three values @xmath12 and it determines the geometry of the two - spaces of constant @xmath0 and @xmath1 . from einstein equations it follows a dynamical equation for the function @xmath13 @xmath14 and an equation for the density evolution @xmath15 where prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath1 , @xmath16 is another arbitrary function and @xmath17 is cosmological constant .",
    "so we have two einstein equations ( [ 11 ] ) , ( [ 12 ] ) and by solving the first one we obtain one more arbitrary function @xmath18 , which enters the solution in the form @xmath19 .",
    "from now on we will use a redefined form of the density @xmath20 and for the sake of simplicity we will drop the bar .    as mentioned above",
    ", the metric does not have any symmetries , in other words it has no killing vectors .",
    "nevertheless the three spaces of constant @xmath0 are conformally flat @xcite .",
    "the parametrization of the metric involves 6 arbitrary functions however the number of physical degrees of freedom is 5 , because we can still rescale the radial coordinate ( the metric is invariant with respect to the transformation @xmath21 ) .      the sign of the function @xmath2 effects the solution of the einstein equation ( [ 11 ] ) .",
    "it is a dynamical equation for @xmath13 and it looks very similar to the friedman equation , except that here the functions @xmath2 and @xmath16 depend on @xmath1 .",
    "we will assume only the case when @xmath23 .",
    "there are three different types of evolution @xcite . if @xmath24 the evolution is elliptic which means that the universe is first expanding and at some point the expansion stops and the universe is collapsing to a final singularity .",
    "the solution is given in a parametric form @xmath25 for @xmath26 the evolution is hyperbolic in the sense that the sign of the expansion does not change , the universe either expands or collapses depending on initial conditions and the parametric solution to the equation ( [ 11 ] ) is @xmath27 for @xmath3 the evolution is parabolic and is given by equation @xmath28 since @xmath2 is a function of @xmath1 , the universe may have different evolution in different regions .",
    "the parabolic evolution can be on the boundary between two regions , one having elliptic evolution and the other one hyperbolic .",
    "so the sign of @xmath2 determines the sign of scalar curvature of the three - spaces of constant @xmath0 and when @xmath29 , the three - spaces are flat which corresponds to a presence of pure decaying modes as was shown in @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath22 is called the bang time function , because @xmath30 is the moment when big bang happened .",
    "so unlike in homogeneous models , the initial moment of evolution is position dependent .",
    "the interpretation of the other metric functions ( @xmath13 , @xmath16 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) depends on @xmath11 and from now on we will only consider the case @xmath31 which is often called the quasi - spherical case .      we can make a coordinate transformation @xcite @xmath32 and rewrite the induced two - metric of the surfaces of constant @xmath0 and @xmath1 into coordinates @xmath33 and @xmath34 . after applying the transformation we get @xmath35 which is a metric on a unit sphere .",
    "the transformation ( [ 16 ] ) is nothing but a stereographic projection and the function @xmath36 describes how the @xmath37 plane is mapped onto a unit sphere .",
    "every sphere is multiplied by @xmath38 and the function is sometimes called the areal radius , because it is actually the radius of a sphere on a comoving coordinate @xmath1 .      in order to understand more about the geometrical properties of the metric ( [ 9 ] ) it is important to investigate the function @xmath36 .",
    "we can see that this function appears in the metric and in the equation for the density ( [ 12 ] ) in the form @xmath39 .",
    "particularly , we can investigate when the function is equal to zero and what are its extreme values . using the transformation ( [ 16 ] ) in ( [ 10 ] ) and ( [ 25 ] ) we can write @xmath39 as @xmath40 the equation @xmath41 now becomes @xmath42 and after realizing that @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , the equation ( [ 28 ] ) becomes @xmath46 which is an equation of a plane that goes through the origin of the spherical coordinate system and intersects the @xmath47 sphere in a great circle . now calculating the derivatives of ( [ 31 ] ) with respect to @xmath33 and @xmath34 and putting it equal to zero we can find that there are two extreme values and they are located at opposite sites on the sphere , in other words if one extreme is at the coordinates @xmath48 , the other one is at @xmath49 and they are located symmetrically with respect to the plane @xmath41 , because the coordinates of the extremes are exactly the components of the unit normal to the plane @xmath41 .",
    "the values of the extremes are @xmath50 where max and min refers to maximum and minimum respectively .",
    "so the extremes have opposite values and the function @xmath39 behaves on the sphere like a dipole @xcite .",
    "we are now going to study the formula for the density ( [ 12 ] ) .",
    "we can see that under certain circumstances the density can change sign or possibly diverge if the denominator becomes zero .",
    "those points where this happens are called the shell crossing singularity .",
    "the conditions that the metric functions @xmath16 , @xmath2 , @xmath51 and @xmath13 have to satisfy in order to avoid shell crossing singularity can be found in @xcite . in this section",
    "we will derive the conditions that the extreme values of the density @xmath52 and @xmath53 have to satisfy in order to avoid the shell crossing singularity .    we can rewrite ( [ 12 ] ) as @xmath54 where we define @xmath55 and @xmath56 here",
    "@xmath57 is the density that we get from ( [ 12 ] ) if we set @xmath41 .",
    "it is also a radial density in the sense that on a given @xmath1 it is the value of the density around the great circle that lies in the plane that defines the dipole on the sphere .",
    "the index @xmath58 refers to lemaitre - tolman - bondi metric , because its density is given with exactly the same formula as ( [ 35 ] ) .",
    "if we make the choice @xmath59 and use the fact that the function @xmath16 depends only on @xmath1 , we can express it on the initial time slice when @xmath41 as @xmath60 where the index @xmath61 refers to the value of the function at the initial time @xmath62 .",
    "in that case the definitions @xmath63 and @xmath64 can be further rewritten as @xmath65 the initial condition ( [ ic ] ) and formulas ( [ 37 ] ) - ( [ den ] ) will however not be used in the following calculations ( with the exception of equation ( [ 68 ] ) giving critical point position ) and the main results of this section are independent of it , thus giving us generally applicable criteria .",
    "it is good to take a look at the derivative of the density with respect to @xmath39 @xmath66 from the derivative we can see , that if @xmath67 the derivative is positive and the density is growing as @xmath39 increases . on the other hand",
    "if @xmath68 the density will decrease as @xmath39 increases . either way we can see that the density behaves on each sphere also like a dipole in the sense that it has two extreme values , maximum and minimum and they are located at the same position as extreme values of the function @xmath39 . in the case when @xmath68 we can write for the density maximum @xmath69 and for the minimum @xmath70 in the case when @xmath67 the role of @xmath71 interchanges with @xmath72 in the last two equations .",
    "we split the investigation of the density into three parts , in the first part we investigate when both the numerator and the denominator are positive , in the second case we check when they are both negative and in the last case we take a look at the special case when they are both zero",
    ". it will be convenient to split the first part into three more subcases depending on the value of @xmath73 .",
    "for the investigation we will also need a formula for the function @xmath39 given in terms of @xmath57 and @xmath74 which we can derive from ( [ 34 ] ) @xmath75    first case : numerator and denominator of the density are both positive .",
    "+ subcase a : @xmath68    from the positivity of the denominator in ( [ 34 ] ) we get @xmath76 because as follows from ( [ 38 ] ) if @xmath68 we can see that @xmath39 has maximum where the density has minimum . from the dipole property @xmath77 we know that @xmath71 is non - negative and ( [ 42 ] ) implies that @xmath78 and therefore we have to consider @xmath79 .",
    "we can now set conditions for @xmath53 so that the right hand side in ( [ 42 ] ) is nonnegative . inequality ( [ 42 ] ) simplifies to @xmath80 it is reasonable to require @xmath81 , because the minimum should be the smallest value on each sphere ( @xmath82 corresponds to the case when the density is homogeneously distributed on the whole sphere ) . since we consider",
    "@xmath79 it follows that @xmath83 and the right hand side of ( [ 42 ] ) is nonnegative .",
    "it means that besides the obvious condition @xmath81 we do nt have any other restriction for the minimum .",
    "due to the dipole property we can try to derive a condition for the maximum @xmath84 since @xmath52 should be greater than or equal to @xmath57 it implies that @xmath85 in order for the right hand side in ( [ 45 ] ) to be non - negative .",
    "this condition is reasonable since @xmath74 is not true value of the density as follows from its definition ( [ 36 ] ) .",
    "taking this into consideration we can solve the inequality ( [ 45 ] ) and the solution is @xmath86 and this condition is clearly more restrictive than @xmath85 .",
    "for the numerator of ( [ 34 ] ) we need @xmath87 which can be rewritten as @xmath88 it again follows that @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the right - hand side of ( [ 48 ] ) has to be non - negative and we know that @xmath81 and since @xmath79 we also have @xmath83 so the inequality ( [ 48 ] ) is always true and we do nt get any new condition for @xmath53 .",
    "we now use the property ( [ 44 ] ) and look for a condition for @xmath52 @xmath89 we know that @xmath90 so to make the right hand side non - negative we need @xmath85 . the solution to the inequality ( [ 49 ] )",
    "is @xmath91 the conditions for the denominator and the numerator have to be satisfied simultaneously , so for the maximum we have ( [ 46 ] ) and ( [ 50 ] ) and ( as can be seen from figure 1 ) the condition ( [ 50 ] ) is stronger in the case of @xmath79 and has to be fulfilled in order for the density to be positive .",
    "as far as the minimum is concerned , apart from the obvious condition @xmath81 it is not constrained at all .",
    "first case : numerator and denominator of the density are both positive .",
    "+ subcase b : @xmath67    the subcase b will be investigated similarly .",
    "the only difference is that from ( [ 38 ] ) we know that if @xmath68 the function @xmath39 has maximum where the density has maximum and this modifies ( [ 39 ] ) and ( [ 40 ] ) accordingly . from the denominator of ( [ 34 ] ) we have @xmath92 which again implies @xmath78 and @xmath93 because @xmath94 and it simplifies to @xmath95 the analysis is basically the same , we again need the right - hand side to be non - negative . we know",
    "that @xmath90 and therefore @xmath96 as well , so the inequality ( [ 52 ] ) will be always true as long as @xmath93 and we do nt get any further condition for the maximum . for the minimum we have @xmath97 in order for the right - hand side to be non - negative we need @xmath98 which is a valid condition for the density minimum , because as mentioned above @xmath74 is not true value of the density .",
    "the inequality ( [ 53 ] ) has the solution @xmath99    from the numerator of ( [ 34 ] ) we have the condition @xmath100 it again implies @xmath78 and @xmath93 and it does not give us any constraint for the maximum , because we know that @xmath90 and therefore @xmath96 .",
    "so ( [ 55 ] ) holds as long as @xmath78 and @xmath93 . for the minimum we can write @xmath101 the right - hand side will be positive if @xmath98 and the solution to ( [ 56 ] ) is @xmath102 all together in the case of @xmath67 we have two conditions ( [ 54 ] ) and ( [ 57 ] ) for the minimum and as can be seen from figure 1 the first one is stronger . for the maximum , except for the obvious @xmath90 , we do nt have any constraint so the density will be positive as long as ( [ 54 ] ) holds and @xmath90 .    , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath57 .",
    "]    first case : numerator and denominator of the density are both positive .",
    "+ subcase c : @xmath105    before we consider this special case we can first rewrite ( [ 34 ] ) as @xmath106 now using @xmath105 we can see that the formula for the density simplifies @xmath107 in other words the value of the density is independent of @xmath33 and @xmath34 and the density is homogeneously distributed on the whole sphere as follows also from ( [ 38 ] ) because the derivative of the density is now zero .",
    "using the same argument as in subcase a and b we have @xmath78 and therefore @xmath108 . for the extreme values of the density",
    "we obviously need in this case @xmath109    the point where @xmath108 is especially interesting because the shell - crossing conditions for @xmath52 and @xmath53 change here and the location of @xmath52 and @xmath53 interchanges by passing through the plane @xmath41 .",
    "the position of this critical point @xmath110 generally evolves and we can get its value as the solution to the equation @xmath111 where we used the initial condition ( [ ic ] ) and formulas ( [ den ] ) in order to express @xmath57 and @xmath74 . so the time evolution of the critical point will depend on the time evolution of the function @xmath112 .",
    "second case : numerator and denominator of the density are both negative .    in order for the denominator of the density ( [ 34 ] ) to be negative ,",
    "we need @xmath113 this condition will not be fulfilled unless @xmath114 because @xmath115 .",
    "the investigation is than similar as in the first case and leads to the same conditions for @xmath53 and @xmath52 as can be easily verified .    on the other hand",
    "if @xmath78 and we allow the denominator to be negative on a given @xmath1 , it will be also positive on that @xmath1 for some specific @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "this behaviour may or may not be correct , depending on the behaviour of the numerator and specifically depending on whether or not the numerator changes sign at the same @xmath33 , @xmath34 . for the numerator we have inequality",
    "@xmath116 this can be rewritten as @xmath117 the same argument as in the case of denominator tells us that this will be satisfied only if @xmath114 .",
    "so if the numerator is negative on a given @xmath1 but @xmath78 , there is a region on this @xmath1 where it is positive too . for the positiveness of the denominator in a region",
    "@xmath118 we have @xmath119 and for the numerator the condition is @xmath120 clearly the conditions are not the same unless @xmath108 , so except for this special case , there will always be a region on a given @xmath1 where the numerator and the denominator will have different signs .",
    "the places where the sign changes are in both cases circles on the sphere , that are parallel to the great circle that defines the plane of the dipole .",
    "the order in which the circles go are seen in figure 2 , where the parallel circles are mapped as parallel lines .",
    "so if in the second case @xmath78 there are no conditions for the density extremes that would prevent shell crossing .",
    "third case : numerator and denominator of the density are both zero .",
    "the denominator is zero when @xmath121 but this equation will be satisfied on a given @xmath1 for all @xmath33 and @xmath34 only if both @xmath112 and @xmath39 are zero .",
    "this consequently means that @xmath122 .",
    "the same arguments are valid for the numerator of the density .",
    "as was discussed in @xcite and in the context of ltb metric in @xcite this point will not be a singularity if also @xmath123 .",
    "since @xmath124 and @xmath125 are independent of time it implies that @xmath126 can not evolve and we need stationary configuration in order to avoid shell crossing .",
    "[ tab1 ]     @xmath52 +   + @xmath127 & @xmath128 +   + @xmath129 & @xmath130 +   + @xmath82 & @xmath131 +    the table 1 summarizes the conditions for the extreme values of the density that we obtained so that shell crossing would be avoided .",
    "from the dipole property ( [ 44 ] ) it follows that there is a constraint between the density extremes @xmath132 which means that knowing one extreme value allows us calculate the other one with a formula @xmath133 that follows from ( [ 69 ] ) . and",
    "for the other extreme we just interchange min for max in the last equation .",
    "consequently it is sufficient to ensure that just one of the extremes satisfies the conditions in table 1 and the constraint ( [ 69 ] ) ensures that the other density extreme has a value that does not break the conditions in table 1 .",
    "in the previous section we derived conditions that @xmath52 and @xmath53 have to satisfy in order to avoid shell crossing singularity . to find out",
    "if a shell crossing occurs at a given time , we need to calculate @xmath52 or @xmath53 at that time and then check if the conditions are met . it would be useful to have conditions in terms of the initial @xmath134 and @xmath135 or @xmath136 that would ensure no shell crossing at any time during the evolution . in this section",
    "we show that in the special case when @xmath3 , if we avoid shell crossing at the initial time , it is guaranteed that no shell crossing occurs during the time evolution .",
    "first we show that if on the initial time slice @xmath137 , then this condition holds at any later time .",
    "we will use the initial condition ( [ ic ] ) and start with the inequality that we want to prove @xmath138 @xmath139 this can be rewritten as @xmath140 and the inequality sign depends on the sign of @xmath126 and here we assumed @xmath78 .",
    "we can see that the time dependence in the last inequality is hidden in the function @xmath141 . the choice @xmath3 has parabolic evolution and the solution to the equation ( [ 11 ] ) is given by ( [ 15 ] ) . if we substitute in ( [ 15 ] ) for @xmath16 from ( [ 37 ] )",
    "we get @xmath142 we can fix the bang time function @xmath51 using ( [ ic ] ) to be @xmath143,\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the initial moment of the evolution . by calculating the radial derivative of ( [ 73 ] ) we can express @xmath141 as @xmath144 after calculating radial derivative of the bang time function ( [ 74 ] ) and substituting it in the last formula we obtain @xmath145 now we define @xmath146 and using this definition we can rewrite ( [ 76 ] ) as @xmath147 from this formula it can be shown that @xmath141 is a monotonic function of @xmath0 . for @xmath148 ,",
    "its value is 1 , which follows from our initial condition @xmath149 and for @xmath150 , @xmath151 so it is increasing if @xmath137 and it is decreasing if @xmath152 . in any case",
    "the function is positive which implies @xmath78 so our assumption of the inequality sign in ( [ 72 ] ) is justified . using the definition ( [ 77 ] ) and substituting for @xmath141 into ( [ 72 ] )",
    "we get @xmath153 since @xmath154 the last inequality will be satisfied as long as @xmath155 , which is equivalent to @xmath137 as can be seen from the definition of @xmath156 .",
    "so we can see exactly what we wanted to prove , if @xmath137 than @xmath138 at any time .",
    "similarly we could prove that if @xmath152 than @xmath157 at any time .",
    "next we will assume that @xmath137 and we will express the shell crossing condition @xmath158 in terms of initial data . for the function",
    "@xmath39 we have formula ( [ 41 ] ) and since the function does not depend on time , we can express it on the initial time slice @xmath159 we plug the last formula into ( [ 40 ] ) and after some calculations we get @xmath160 and we used @xmath161 which follows from its definitions ( [ 35 ] ) and ( [ 36 ] ) .",
    "we will now define @xmath162 and using this definition with ( [ 77 ] ) we can rewrite ( [ 81 ] ) as @xmath163 the inequality @xmath158 can now be rewritten as @xmath164 we need to multiply the last inequality by the denominator , but in order to do that we need to find out its sign . from ( [ 77 ] ) and ( [ 82 ] ) it follows @xmath165 next using the minimal value of @xmath141 to be @xmath166 we can write for the denominator of ( [ 86 ] ) @xmath167 because we assume @xmath137 , i.e @xmath155 .",
    "so the denominator is negative and when we multiply by it in ( [ 86 ] ) , we get after some calculations @xmath168 which is inequality ( [ 72 ] ) written in terms of @xmath156 and we already proved that it holds as long as @xmath155 .",
    "so we can see that if @xmath137 than @xmath158 is fulfilled and the shell crossing will be avoided at any time . similarly it could be shown that in the case @xmath152 , i.e. @xmath169 , if @xmath170 than @xmath171 at any time .",
    "we can also see that if @xmath172 at some point @xmath110 , it means that we have @xmath173 and from ( [ 78 ] ) it follows @xmath174 .",

    "we will choose @xmath134 in such a way that @xmath175 .",

    "also if at late time @xmath0 the bang time function is small compared to @xmath0 we can see that @xmath198 is proportional to @xmath201 .",
    "we can try to evaluate ( [ 104 ] ) at the initial time @xmath148 @xmath202 so we can see that if a is close to 1 the approximation gives us what we expect .",
    "the szekeres spacetime has 5 degrees of freedom , so to fully specify the model we need to set up 5 functions .",
    "but since we are only interested in the density contrast , it is sufficient to specify just three functions , which is the curvature function @xmath2 that we assume to be zero , the initial radial profile @xmath134 and one extreme value of the density .",
    "we will set up two models @xmath203 and @xmath204 .",
    "for the initial radial profile we choose @xmath205 both of them are peaked at the origin and @xmath206 is the background density at the initial time .",
    "the @xmath134 is chosen in such a way that besides the origin it is less then @xmath207 , therefore for the extreme value we specify the density minimum since the only requirement for it is that it has to be equal to @xmath134 at the origin and less everywhere else .",
    "we choose @xmath135 as @xmath208 the models differ by the size of the radial inhomogeneity that is in the model @xmath204 twice as big as in the model @xmath203 and we want to demonstrate , that the approximation formula will work better for the model @xmath203 , because the function @xmath156 is closer to 1 than in the model @xmath204 .",
    "the functions @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath207 for the model @xmath203 are shown in figure 3a .",
    "the function @xmath156 for both models is shown in figure 3b .",
    "the initial time is chosen as @xmath209 that approximately corresponds to the time of last scattering .",
    "the final time @xmath210 which is approximately present time .",
    "the initial density contrast @xmath211 and the final density contrast @xmath212 for both models are shown in figures 4 , @xmath213 denotes the background density at the final time .",
    "the impact of the time evolution on the initial shape is minimal as we expected since @xmath156 is close to @xmath214 , on the other hand the magnitude of the density contrast drops significantly because of the factor @xmath215 in ( [ 104 ] ) .",
    "we can also see in the figure 4 that the formula ( [ 104 ] ) approximates the density contrast better for the model @xmath203 , that corresponds to the lower peak , because we chose the radial inhomogeneity lower than in model @xmath204 .",
    "we studied model of inhomogeneity in quasispherical szekeres model .",
    "we set up only 3 of 5 degrees of freedom , which is sufficient for studying the evolution of the density contrast .",
    "the lack of specification of the last two degrees of freedom means that we do not have the detailed information about the density distribution , particularly we do not know the position of the extreme values on the spheres .",
    "we specify the initial radial density profile @xmath134 which is the value of the density around the great circle that lies in the plane that defines the dipole .",
    "next , we choose one extreme value of the density at the initial time , either @xmath135 or @xmath136 , and the last function that we choose is the curvature function @xmath2 . in order to choose an appropriate value for the density extremes",
    ", we investigated the shell crossing conditions in terms of density @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath57 and @xmath74 .",
    "we derived conditions that @xmath52 and @xmath216 have to satisfy in order to avoid shell crossing and we showed that in the special case @xmath3 , if the conditions are fulfilled on the initial time slice , then they will hold at any time .",
    "next , we derived an analytical formula for the density contrast @xmath198 as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in the special case @xmath3",
    ", we derived an approximation formula that is valid if the initial inhomogeneity is small and we showed that in this approximation the density contrast is proportional to the initial density contrast and depends on time as @xmath215 , so there is a decrease in magnitude during time evolution , however the shape of the function is preserved .",
    "it shows that the dynamics is very simple and close to homogeneous one for small inhomogeneity confirming the expected behaviour . in this sense",
    "one may argue that a small inhomogeneity can be successfully treated in perturbation theory and the influence of nonlinearity is negligible .",
