    "the isocam instrument ( cesarsky et al . 1996 ) on board of the _ infrared space observatory _ ( _ iso _ ; kessler et al .",
    "1996 ) has been able to unveil at 15 @xmath0 a population of mir galaxies with two orders of magnitude fainter flux densities than observed by the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( _ iras _ ) .",
    "these galaxies result to be ten times more numerous than expected if there were no evolution from @xmath12 up to @xmath13 ( see elbaz et al .",
    "these results are confirmed by the detection of a substantial diffuse cosmic infrared background in the 140 @xmath14 m - 1 mm range ( puget et al .",
    "1996 ; hauser et al . 1998 ; fixsen et al . 1998",
    "; lagache et al .",
    "1999 ) , which suggests a strong evolution of the galaxies in the ir ( stronger than observed at any other wavelengths ) .",
    "the suggested evolution can either imply a larger fraction of galaxies experiencing an ir luminous phase in the past , or that mir galaxies were more luminous in the past ( see e.g. chary & elbaz 2001 ) .",
    "so far , the nature of the sources responsible for the strong evolution observed in the mir band has only been studied in small fields , containing sources well known at other wavelengths : the hubble deep field north ( hdf - n ; aussel et al .",
    "1999a , b ) and south ( hdf - s ; oliver et al .",
    "2002 ; mann et al . 2002 ; franceschini et al .",
    "2003 ) , the canada - france redshift survey ( cfrs ) 1452 + 52 field ( flores et al . 1999 ) and the elais - s2 field ( pozzi et al . 2003 ) .",
    "this has yielded a small but meaningful sample of sources sufficient for most multiwavelength studies .",
    "most of these sources can easily be identified with relatively bright optical counterparts ( @xmath15 ) with a median redshift of @xmath16 imposed by the mir _ k_-correction ( aussel et al .",
    "1999a , b ; flores et al .",
    "1999 ) .    however , to obtain reliable source counts and statistically significant information about the nature and evolution of the mir extragalactic source population , large - area surveys covering a wide range of flux densities are required .",
    "in particular , it is very important to bridge the gap between the _ iras _ surveys ( @xmath17 mjy ) and the deep isocam surveys ( @xmath18 mjy ) .",
    "elais ( oliver et  al . 2000 ) , with its broad flux range ( 0.5@xmath19150 mjy ) and several thousand sources detected over a @xmath312 deg@xmath20 area ( rowan - robinson et  al .",
    "2004 ) , is the crucial survey to investigate the nature and evolution of the mir sources in the region where the source counts start diverging from the non - evolution predictions ( a few mjy at 15 @xmath14 m ; elbaz et al .",
    "1999 ; gruppioni et al .",
    "2002 ) and with data not affected by cosmic variance ( which might be a strong effect in the narrow area surveys ) .    in order to better understand the nature of the mir extragalactic population on the basis of a larger identification statistics than the ones obtained so far , we performed photometric and spectroscopic identifications for a source sample selected at 15 @xmath14 m in the elais southern field s1 ( @xmath34 deg@xmath20 ) . here",
    "we present the results of the identification of 406 objects , which form a complete and highly reliable sub - sample drawn from the 15 @xmath0 catalog of lari et  al .",
    "the areal coverage , mir and optical completeness are discussed in detail to allow statistical and evolutionary analyses with this sample .",
    "the counts down to 0.6  mjy for each class of source have been derived . the multiwavelength ( radio , mir , near - infrared ( nir ) , optical ) properties of the 15 @xmath14 m sources are investigated in order to study the nature and evolution of the infrared extragalactic population .",
    "the infrared luminosity function and the evolution of 15 @xmath14 m galaxies and agn are discussed in two companion papers ( pozzi et al .",

    "the elais - s1 area has been observed by isocam at 15 @xmath14 m with 9 separate rasters ( see figure [ field ] ) .",
    "20 out of the 462 sources were excluded as they were detected twice at the edges of overlapping rasters ( in this case the sources with the highest s / n ratio have been selected ) .",
    "moreover , 36 sources were excluded as we decided to use only those sources with the highest reliability ( rel=0 ) after a visual inspection of their pixel histories .",
    "the isocam observations of the central ( s1_5 ) raster have been repeated three times ( instead of one ) and thus in this part the survey reaches fainter fluxes . as a consequence , we have divided the sample into two regions : a ) s1_5 ( i.e. raster 5 ) which covers 0.55 deg@xmath20 and reaches a 20@xmath40 completeness at @xmath30.7 mjy , and b ) s1_rest ( i.e. all the remaining rasters ) which covers 3.65 deg@xmath20 and reaches a 20@xmath40 completeness at @xmath31.1 mjy .",
    "note that in this work , as well as in the counts paper ( gruppioni et al .",

    "this interpretation is discussed in detail by pozzi et al .",
    "anyway the counts ( see figure [ fig_counts ] ) show that the upturn is mostly due to the contribution of the @xmath56 sources ( i.e. sources fainter than our spectroscopic or photometric limits ) , which represent about half of the extragalactic sources at fluxes @xmath30.6 - 1 mjy .",
    "these sources could be either optically less luminous ( absorbed ? ) galaxies at redshift similar to those of the already spectroscopically identified sample , or higher redshift sources .",
    "we favor the second hypothesis on the basis of the following discussion .",
    "we have tried to estimate a redshift for the @xmath56 sources in order to distinguish between the two different scenarios described above .",
    "we have combined our sample with the fainter hdf - s and hdf - n samples .",
    "then we have tried to derive a flux - redshift relationship applicable to the elais - s1 unidentified sources in order to estimate their redshifts .",
    "after several trials using multiple polynomial relations between @xmath73 and both 15 @xmath14 m flux ( @xmath74 ) and magnitude ( @xmath43 ) , we have assigned a redshift to the 116 @xmath75 sources on the basis of their @xmath43 magnitudes only ( @xmath76 was assumed for all the unidentified 76 ( @xmath77 ) sources ) , by considering the following empirical relation and its spread :    @xmath78 where @xmath79 (= 0.15 ) is the 1@xmath35 dispersion of the relation and @xmath80 is a gaussian distribution with center 0 and width @xmath79 ( see figure [ fig_fitz ] , @xmath81 ) .",
    "note that the fit is non - linear in @xmath73 vs. @xmath43 , since we found that a linear fit to the data extrapolated to faint magnitudes was providing too high redshifts , inconsistent with the k - correction limit of isocam ( @xmath82 ) and with the median redshifts of @xmath83 objects from the hdf - s and hdf - n . using the estimated redshifts , we have computed mir and optical luminosities for the unidentified sources ( by assuming all of them being star - forming galaxies , thus using m82 sed ) and we have placed also these objects in the @xmath71 vs. @xmath66 diagram ( see the @xmath84 panel of figure [ fig_fitz ] ) .    according to our estimates ,",
    "the unidentified objects in our survey are likely to be rather luminous mir objects ( @xmath66 ranging between @xmath85 l@xmath7 and a few @xmath86 l@xmath7 , in the lig / ulig region ) , and their optical and mir estimated luminosities appear to be consistent with ( and extending to higher luminosities ) the @xmath71 vs. @xmath66 correlation found for the identified sources . the estimated redshift distribution for the unidentified sources is shown in figure [ fig_z_empty ] , where it is compared with the distribution found for the spectroscopically identified sources and with the model fitting derived from our data ( i.e. the 15 @xmath14 m luminosity function in s1 ; pozzi et al .",
    "the agreement between the model and the data ( either observed and estimated ) is good .",
    "it results that the unidentified sources are expected to fill the secondary high-@xmath11 peak of the model - predicted redshift distribution .",
    "the double peaked redshift distribution ( see figure [ fig_z_empty ] ) is caused by the 15 @xmath0 k - correction . as shown in figure [ fig_kcorr ] , at @xmath11=0.5 the 15 @xmath0 observed fluxes decrease by @xmath330% . for our flux",
    "limited sample this implies that the elais - s1 galaxies at @xmath11=0.5 correspond to 30% higher intrinsic luminosities .",
    "but at @xmath11=0.5 the elais - s1 galaxies sample the bright steep slope of the luminosity function ( log(l@xmath87@xmath4711 @xmath47 l@xmath88 ) , where 30% higher intrinsic luminosities correspond to an order of magnitude lower density of galaxies .",
    "this decrease of density of galaxies is also evident in the r - magnitude distribution ( see figures [ fig_histr ] and [ fig_sr ] ) , where , due to the k - correction effects , a lack of sources with r@xmath320 - 21 ( and @xmath11@xmath30.5 ) is evident .",
    "the r - band histogram ( figure [ fig_histr ] ) shows a triple peaked distribution : stars populate the brightest peak at r@xmath310 - 12 , @xmath11@xmath10.5 galaxies populate the intermediate peak at r@xmath317 - 19 , and higher redshift ( @xmath11@xmath470.5 ) galaxies populate the fainter peak that can be observed at r@xmath4721 - 22 .    under the alternative hypothesis",
    "that elais - s1 @xmath56 were instead lower redshift ( @xmath11@xmath10.5 ) sources suffering from dust extinction , it would be more appropriate to consider the 15-@xmath0 flux ",
    "@xmath11 relation rather than the @xmath89 relation ( because affected by dust ) to estimate their redshifts . in this case , we would obtain a redshift distribution for the @xmath56 sources similar to that of the optically identified , but they would be located in a separate region of the @xmath71 vs. @xmath66 diagram ( i.e. at similar @xmath66 , but with at least one order of magnitude higher @xmath71 ) .",
    "this would imply the existence of a absolutely different population of objects , with much higher level of obscuration ( without continuity ) than the identified ones , but at similar flux density and redshifts .    the first hypothesis is also supported by the faint spectroscopic identifications in the hdf - n ( aussel et al .",
    "1999 ) and cfrs 1452 + 52 ( flores et al .",
    "1999 ) fields which have mainly found a population of @xmath11=0.4 - 1.0 galaxies .",
    "for all these reasons we conclude that the vast majority of the faint ( r@xmath4720.5 ) elais - s1 @xmath56 objects should belong to the same population as the identified sources , but at higher redshifts ( @xmath11=0.5 - 1.5 ) , and that consequently the present sample is virtually spectroscopically complete up to @xmath11=0.5 , as far as the star forming galaxies are concerned .      as we have seen , our sample is virtually complete up to @xmath90 . up to this redshift",
    "we have identified 167 extragalactic objects : 3 agn1 , 20 agn2 , 33 e(a ) , 9 e(b ) , 67 e(c ) , 32 k(e ) , and 3 k galaxies .",

    "( 1999 ) ( see  4.2 ) . the majority of the sources with @xmath11@xmath10.5 is composed by normal star forming spirals ( e(c ) , 41% ) , and by absorbed star forming galaxies ( e(a ) , 20% ; 23% including the agn2 ) .",
    "the total fraction of optical spectra which show emission lines which are indicators of star formation ( e(b)+e(c)+e(a)+k(e ) ) is 84% .",
    "14% of the sources are agns , and only 2% of the sources do not show emission lines ( k galaxies ) .",
    "this confirms that the mir and the optical data agree on revealing both ongoing star formation and accretion driven ( agn ) activities .",
    "the lack of k+a / a+k galaxies in the elais - s1 sample suggest that these galaxies are not strong mir emitters .",
    "this result is consistent with the lack of emission lines in their optical spectrum and with their post - starburst interpretation ( see poggianti and wu 2002 ) .",
    "the e(a ) galaxies are believed to be associated with dust enshrouded starburst galaxies .",
    "following poggianti et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and poggianti & wu ( 2000 ) , the spectra of e(a ) galaxies are explained as the result of selective dust extinction which affects the youngest , most massive , stars in hii regions much more than the older stellar population responsible for the continuum flux .",
    "a search for similar spectra in the local universe ( poggianti et al . 1999 ) revealed that they are frequent among merging / strongly interacting galaxies ( @xmath340% ) , while they are scarce in optically selected surveys of field galaxies at low @xmath11 : 7 - 8% in the las campanas redshift survey and in kennicut ( 1992 ) .",
    "dressler et al . ( 1999 ) and poggianti et al . ( 1999 ) found that e(a ) galaxies constitute about 10% of their sample of cluster and field galaxies at @xmath11@xmath30.4 - 0.5 .    at 15 @xmath14",

    "the observed 20 - 23% fraction of e(a ) galaxies in the elais - s1 sample at @xmath1@xmath11@xmath47=0.20 , is thus higher than observed in optically selected samples and in agreement with the estimates at similar redshifts by duc et al .",
    "( 2002 ) in a mir selected sample .",
    "this confirms that e(a ) galaxies are dusty absorbed star forming galaxies which are preferentially selected at longer wavelengths ( mir ) , and whose frequency increases with increasing redshift , as the cosmic star formation rate .",
    "we have compared the @xmath52 colors of our sources to those of the field galaxies and we did not find evidences of reddening .",
    "becouse of the bright k - band limit magnitude we limited our comparison in the magnitude range r=15 - 17.5 , and consequently the statistic are poor .",
    "the average r - k color is 2.04 and 2.27 for elais and field galaxies respectively , with a 1@xmath35 dispersion of @xmath30.50 for both samples . on the contrary",
    ", dust extinction seems to affect the spectral lines of our objects . in figure [ fig_alphaoii ] the ew of the [ oii ] line",
    "is compared to the ew of the h@xmath25+[nii ] line .",
    "the @xmath91)/ew(h\\alpha+[nii])$ ] ratio is related to the differential extinction due to dust , the @xmath92 $ ] emission being more affected than @xmath93 emission due to its shorter wavelength .",
    "the dashed line in figure [ fig_alphaoii ] is the relation found by kennicutt ( 1992 ) for local field galaxies ( @xmath91)/ew(h\\alpha+[nii])$]@xmath940.4 ) .",
    "most of our sources lie below that relation , and the presence of upper limits ( i.e. [ oii ] non - detections ) would even lower the average value of the @xmath91)/ew(h\\alpha+[nii])$ ] , implying a larger amount of extinction in our data than in the local sample of kennicutt ( 1992 ) .",
    "the average ratio for the galaxies having both [ oii ] and h@xmath25+[nii ] lines is 0.36@xmath950.15 , 0.35@xmath950.03 , 0.29@xmath950.02 for e(b ) , e(c ) and e(a ) galaxies respectively .",
    "thus , as expected , at least for the normal star forming ( e(c ) ) and absorbed star forming ( e(a ) ) galaxies the difference from the local observed ratio ( 0.4 ) is significant .    in order to disentangle a possible dependence on redshift or luminosity of the average extinction of the galaxies",
    ", we have combined our sample with a subsample of 39 galaxies from the local sample of rms for which ew measures for [ oii ] and h@xmath25+[nii ] were available in the literature ( see alexander & aussel ( 2000 ) for a discussion of this sample ) .",
    "the data show that the extinction affecting the lines is an increasing function of luminosity while a correlation with redshift is not statistically significant : a partial correlation kendall test gives in fact a 10@xmath96 probability that the ew is not dependent on luminosity , and a 0.04 probability that the ew is not dependent on redshift .",
    "figure [ fig_linetrend ] ( @xmath97 ) shows the distribution of the rms and elais galaxies in the luminosity - redshift plane .",
    "we have then selected the galaxies with @xmath98@xmath1@xmath11@xmath1@xmath99 in order to show the dependence on luminosity ( figure [ fig_linetrend ] , @xmath100 ) , and the galaxies in a small luminosity interval ( @xmath101@xmath1@xmath102@xmath1@xmath103 ) in order to show the not significant trend with the redshift ( figure [ fig_linetrend ] , @xmath84 ) .",
    "these results suggest an increase of dust extinction with luminosity .",
    "similar results , based on a smaller sample , were found also by pozzi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) in one of the smaller but deeper elais fields , s2 .",
    "a quantitative estimate of the amount of optical extinction affecting the elais - s1 mir galaxy sample can be obtained by the measure of the observed balmer decrement in the h@xmath25 and h@xmath44 lines .",

    "spectra showing h@xmath44 lines in absorption were excluded .",
    "this method was adopted in order to minimize the effects of underling h@xmath44 absorption which causes the observed h@xmath25/h@xmath44 ratio to be larger .",

    "these value refers to the absorption of the lines emission ; typically the absorption on the continuum is a factor of two smaller ( see also pozzi et al . 2003 , and poggianti & wu 2000 for similar results ) .",
    "as expected , the larger extinction values are found for e(a ) and k(e ) galaxies , reinforcing the interpretation that the e(a ) signature is associated with dust extincted starbursts .",
