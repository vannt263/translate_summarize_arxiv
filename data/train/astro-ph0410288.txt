    "rotation curves are the best tool to study the dark matter halos of galaxies , and the most extended ones will better constrain the dark matter halo parameters .",
    "rotation curves derived from neutral hydrogen ( hi ) observations enable us to probe the dark matter potential to distances of at most 20 to 25 @xmath6 ( where @xmath6 is the optical disk exponential scale length ) , for gas - rich late - type spiral galaxies with particularly extended hi ( eg .",
    "ngc2841 from begeman 1987 or ngc2915 from meurer  1996 ) .",
    "but it is not possible to obtain any kinematical data with 21 cm emission further out than the radius at which the gas density falls to levels of a few times @xmath7 atoms @xmath8 , even with very sensitive observations , as the hi column falls off sharply beyond this point ( eg . the hi edge observed in ngc3198 , van gorkom 1991 ) .",
    "this sharp truncation of the hi distribution is believed to be the result of ionization of the atomic gas by the extragalactic uv radiation field ( as predicted by silk & sunyaev 1976 ) . at lower column densities",
    "the neutral fraction is therefore predicted to drop off dramatically in comparison to the total ( ionized ) hydrogen column ( see maloney 1993 ) .",
    "some studies have attempted to detect the faint ionized gas just beyond the hi limit from recombination emission in h@xmath9 .",
    "depending on the volume density of the plasma at the critical column density where the outer disk becomes optically thin to this radiation ( about @xmath10  @xmath8 for ngc3198 ) , the emission measure from recombination radiation expected to be emitted by this ionized gas is only 0.025 to 0.25  @xmath11pc ( maloney 1993 ) .",
    "the only reported detection of recombination radiation so far is that of ngc253 for which sensitive fabry - perot observations by bland - hawthorn  ( 1997 ) managed to extend the hi rotation curve from 1.2 to 1.4 @xmath12 , with measured surface brightness values in h@xmath2 from 80 to 40 mr ( millirayleighs , where 1 rayleigh = 10@xmath13/4@xmath14 photons @xmath8s@xmath15sr@xmath15 or 2.78 @xmath11pc at h@xmath2 ) . but at this level , as pointed out by the authors , the emission is probably not due to recombination after ionization by the metagalactic background , but rather from hot young stars near the center of the galaxy ionizing the warped outer hi disk .",
    "if indeed spiral galaxies have extended ( mostly ionized ) gas disks it should then be possible to detect them in absorption in the spectrum of a bright background quasar , down to hi column densities of only @xmath1610@xmath17 atoms @xmath8 .",
    "with such a suitably placed uv - bright background object one could obtain kinematical information on that galaxy s outer rotation curve out to 30 to 40 @xmath5 or more . at such radii the data",
    "could potentially reveal the extent of the dark matter halo , and constrain the mass profile out to such large galactocentric radii .",
    "this could then provide strong tests of cosmological galaxy formation scenarios .",
    "for example , according to the rotation curves predicted by cold dark matter - dominated n - body simulations ( e.g.  navarro , frenk & white 1996 ) in low - mass dwarf galaxies we should detect a turn - down in the rotation curve if we could get data points just 15 or 20% further out in radius than currently mapped by hi observations .",
    "this matching of a ly@xmath2 absorption line velocity with the kinematics of the nearest galaxy has already been attempted , originally by barcons ( 1995 ) , who found that for two galaxies at z=0.075 and 0.09 the ly@xmath2 velocities as measured from background qsos spectra at impact parameters 64 @xmath1kpc (= 16@xmath5 ) and 83 @xmath1kpc ( = 35@xmath5 ) , were consistent with gas in extended gaseous haloes co - rotating with the inner stellar disks ( with @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the hubble constant and @xmath20 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "hoffman ( 1998 ) found that the dwarf galaxy mcg+00 - 32 - 16 , which is the closest galaxy to the low redshift ly@xmath2 system in the sightline of 3c273 , has an hi disk which would be counter - rotating compared to the ly@xmath2 velocity . in this case",
    "however the impact parameter is 204 kpc which for the dwarf galaxy represents about 153 @xmath5 , in other words an excessively large radius to expect the extended gas halo to reach .",
    "more recently steidel ( 2002 ) have obtained long - slit spectra of 5 intermediate redshift galaxies ( 0.44 @xmath21 z@xmath210.66 ) in the proximity of mgii absorbers sightlines ( with projected separations from 19 to 95 @xmath1kpc ) , and succeeded in reasonably matching the mgii absorbers velocities with the galaxies rotation curves , but only when setting various disk thicknesses and velocity scale heights ( describing the velocity fall - off with z - height above the plane ) case by case .",
    "our approach here is the reverse . instead of identifying and analysing the galaxies found near the line - of - sight of a quasar exhibiting a known ly@xmath2 line ,",
    "we start by selecting nearby galaxies , normal and well - behaved kinematically , hence easy to subsequently model dynamically , and search for bright background quasars at some particular impact parameter away , ie : at the interesting radii beyond the galaxy s hi envelope and up to about 50 @xmath6 .",
    "we then observe these quasars with hst , first to attempt to detect a ly@xmath2 line arising from the extended galaxy s disk , and then to use this ly@xmath2 line velocity to probe the outer dynamics of the galaxy .",
    "our study does not aim at elucidating the overall nature of all ly@xmath2 forest lines ( other studies are better designed for this , by surveying all lines along several qso sightlines and getting numerous spectra of galaxies in the surrounding fields eg .",
    "penton 2002 , morris 2002 ) .",
    "indeed , while it is now generally accepted that most metal - line absorption systems found in qso s spectra are associated with gaseous galaxy halos , the situation for the ly@xmath9 absorption systems has been long under debate .",
    "some studies claim that ( at least the stronger ) ly@xmath2 lines are associated to extended halos of galaxies , while most believe that the majority of the lines occur in the intergalactic medium , tracing the cosmic web ( cf .",
    "van gorkom et al .  1996 ) , this intricate network of filaments and sheets of gas predicted by hydrodynamical simulations ( eg .",
    "dav 1999 ) .",
    "some convincing arguments of the latter are the fact that several ly@xmath2 lines have been detected in voids ( mclin 2002 ) , also confirmed by deep hi observations that would have detected dwarf galaxies and other low surface brigthness galaxies ( shull 1998 )",
    ". also observations of double qsos sightlines find ly@xmath2 lines in common in both spectra on scales of typically half a mpc ( dinshaw 1997 , 1998 ) . here",
    "we are testing the simple conjecture that gaseous galactic disks extend further beyond that which can be probed in emission in hi , by searching for a corresponding ly@xmath2 line .",
    "more importantly , a successful detection , can be used as a dynamical probe of the outer halo of the galaxy .",
    "in section 2 we explain the selection of our targets , section 3 describes the observations ( hst and radio ) , then section 4 discuss the results of matching the ly@xmath2 velocities with the galaxies rotation curves and the implications .",
    "our list of qso - galaxy pairs suitable for our purpose was compiled by cross - correlating all 646 quasars with v@xmath22 17.0 in the vron & vron catalogue 6th edition ( 1993 ) , with the _ hi catalog of galaxies _ ( hutchmeier & richter 1989 ) .",
    "this magnitude limit was imposed to make sure that the background qso observations would stay within a reasonable amount of time to be feasible with hst .",
    "our criteria for selection were :    * i ) * the projected distance between the qso and the galaxy was less than roughly 10 times the optical diameter ( d@xmath23 ) of the galaxy .",
    "this was to find qsos in the interesting region beyond the galaxy s hi emission extent but where the column density of neutral gas would still be high enough to be detected in absorption ( assuming that galaxies have extended gaseous disks out to large radii as suggested by eg .",
    "chen 2001 ) .",
    "* ii ) * the galaxy systemic velocity was @xmath24 550 .",
    "this ensured that the associated ly@xmath2 detection stayed clear from the geocoronal lyman-@xmath2 emission at 1216  ( from the earth s exosphere ) .",
    "moreover this also ensured that the ly@xmath2 detection s velocity would not fall in the range covered by the damped ly@xmath2 wing of our galaxy , which can extend to @xmath25 1220  towards some sightlines , depending on the total hi column density present in that direction .",
    "if a galaxy s systemic velocity is too low , any associated line would get lost in the wing of the galactic damped line , where the continuum against which to detect this absorption line is seriously depleted .",
    "* iii ) * the galaxy was not interacting and was relatively isolated .",
    "this means that an observed ly@xmath9 line would be fairly unambigously assigned to that object , ie",
    ": qso - galaxy pairs in the middle of clusters , such as for 3c273 , were discarded ( but one target , ngc5033 , was later found to be surrounded by several dwarf galaxies , see section 4.1 ) .",
    "* iv ) * the galaxy s optical diameter was at least @xmath26 so that a detailed kinematical study , using hi rotation curves , is feasible ( since the hi radio beams will be in the best cases about a dozen of arcsecs ) . in some cases the rotation curves were already available in the literature . for the same reason the galaxy also had to appear well - behaved \" , with no obvious distortions or morphological asymmetries  in other words as normal as possible .",
    "we observed a sample of 9 qso - galaxy pairs with hst , chosen to cover a range of morphological types ( sa to sd ) , with a range of magnitudes @xmath27 . assuming successful detections of ly@xmath2 absorption lines",
    ", this would allow testing of scaling relations across a wide range of galaxy properties . for example chen ( 1998 ) , in their study of 26 galaxy - absorber pairs with separations ranging from 16 to 209 @xmath1 kpc , find that the strength of the absorption depends not only on the impact parameter separation but also on the b - band luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "hence galaxies with a wide range of properties were chosen for our sample to investigate these possible trends .",
    "table  [ tab3 ] lists the properties of our selected target galaxies .",
    "note that the impact parameters of the galaxy - qsos are based on distances estimated using @xmath28 km / s / mpc . in the case of ngc2841",
    "there is a cepheid distance of 14.1 @xmath29 1.5 mpc ( macri 2001 ) .",
    "its velocity simply estimated with @xmath30 would give a distance of 8.5 mpc , which is only 60% of this true distance .",
    "hence this gives an idea of the possible large uncertainties in these impact parameters estimates .",
    "spectroscopy of our 9 target qsos was obtained with the hst ghrs through the small science aperture ( ssa ) with the g140l grating , as well as with the hst stis / fuv - mama through the 52x0.1 aperture with the g140l and g140 m gratings , as listed in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "this table also gives details of the observations ( the hst dataset filenames , date of the observations ) and the total integration times of the spectra .",
    "since the qsos have a range of fluxes , the integrations were set such as to result in a 3@xmath31 limiting equivalent width of at least 0.3  , or in the case of the stis data , to fill completely the one orbit necessary ( this 3@xmath31 limit being in almost all cases achievable in less than one orbit ) .",
    "the preliminary ghrs data reduction was carried out with the standard calhrs software using the final ghrs reference files , and further reduction and analysis were performed with the iraf / stsdas package . to fully sample the psf ,",
    "quarter - diode substepping was employed , producing four spectra per exposure . with this mode 6% of the time",
    "is spent measuring the background with the science diodes .",
    "the wavelength shifts between these different groups , and then between the different exposures , were determined to align all the spectra before combining them and merging the wavelength and flux information . with the g140l grating the dispersion is 0.57   per diode , corresponding to a velocity resolution of about 140  at 1200  . the default wavelength scale is expected to have a maximum rms of 55 m  for g140l .",
    "however , zero - point shifts can be significant : even though we used the small aperture which will limit the effect of the uncertainty in the position of the target within the aperture , thermal effects in the ghrs as well as geomagnetic effects are a large source of wavelength error ( see ghrs instrument handbook ) .",
    "the wavelength accuracy achievable is about 30 , even when a wavelength calibration exposure is obtained just before the science exposure .",
    "for this reason these zero - points were corrected by assuming that low - ionization galactic interstellar lines lie at the same velocity as the observed dominant component of the galactic hi along these sightlines .",
    "the strongest galactic lines were used such as si iii @xmath321206.5 , si ii @xmath321260.4 and cii @xmath321334.5 .",
    "the galactic hi lsr velocity measurements were taken from the leiden / dwingeloo survey ( hartmann & burton 1997 ) .",
    "for the stis observations , the g140 m centered at 1222   provides a resolution of 20  ( with a pixel size of 0.05  ) and wavelength coverage from 1195 to 1249  .",
    "in addition short g140l observations were obtained for the 3 qsos at higher redshifts ( pg1049 - 005 , pks1103 - 006 , and pg1259 + 593 ) .",
    "this was to make sure that any absorption feature detected at 1218 - 1222   ( where our ly@xmath2 lines are expected ) is not in fact a ly@xmath33 line associated with some ly@xmath2 line at higher redshift along the sightline .",
    "the g140l therefore provided us with a spectrum over a larger wavelength range ( roughly 1130 to 1720  ) to check on this possibility .",
    "the standard calstis procedures were followed to flatfield the individual spectra , extract them and then wavelength - calibrate and flux - calibrate them .",
    "the mama spectroscopic accuracy is expected to be about 0.2 pixel when using the narrow slit ( @xmath03  with g140 m ) , but is ill - defined in practice . hence the zero - points were corrected the same way as for the ghrs data , by shifting galactic lines in the spectra to the main galactic hi lsr velocity . in this case the galactic lines used were si iii @xmath321206.5 and ni @xmath321199.55 , @xmath321200.22 , @xmath321200.71 when suitable . for the galactic hi velocities , several sightlines had higher resolution hi galactic spectra from effelsberg ( wakker 2001 , 9.1 beam ) , and for the rest the measurements were extracted from the leiden / dwingeloo survey ( hartmann & burton 1997 , 36 beam ) , or from nrao 43 m data ( lockman & savage 1995 , 21 beam ) .",
    "care was taken with galactic features at non - lsr velocities due to high - velocity clouds ( hvcs ) present in some of our sightlines .",
    "for example the mrk876 sightline crosses the region of complex c , a prominent hvc covering  10% of the northern sky , and consequently the galactic and complex c si iii line are blended in the spectrum ( gibson 2001 ) .",
    "our final shifts applied to the spectra differed from the original calibration by 0.8  up to 11.6  at most .",
    "finally , after continuum fitting and normalization with a low - order polynomial , wavelengths and equivalent widths were measured , and voigt profiles were fitted to the observed absorption lines .",
    "these profile fits are depicted in figure  [ fig3 ] . in the case of pg1309 + 355 , slightly better residuals were obtained if fitting 3 subcomponents to the line , and similarly for pg0804 + 761 with 2 subcomponents . for sightlines with non - detections ,",
    "equivalent width limits were calculated following the equations of ebbets ( 1995 ) .",
    "ly@xmath9 absorption lines were successfully detected for 5 of our qso - galaxy targets ( illustrated in figure 1 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the ( unbinned ) spectra with the detections , as well as the 4 spectra with non - detections .",
    "table  [ tab3 ] lists the detections , and their corresponding velocities and equivalent widths .",
    "in many cases other ly@xmath2 lines were also detected along the same sightlines at other various redshifts , and do not necessarily seem to be associated with any nearby galaxy .",
    "these will be discussed more fully in a forthcoming paper . in all cases",
    "the velocities of our detections agreed within errors with those in the literature when available , for example from higher resolution fuse data detecting the ly@xmath33 counterparts of some of our lines .",
    "for pg0804 + 761 our line of interest at @xmath34=1570  has not been previously reported , but a higher redshift line in the spectrum which we detect at @xmath35=5561 @xmath29 8  has been reported by shull ( 2000 ) at @xmath35=5565  and by richter ( 2001 ) at @xmath35=5553  ( from a fuse ly@xmath33 line ) . for mrk876 shull ( 2000 ) report a @xmath35=958  ( no errors quoted ) for which we have @xmath35=950 @xmath36 .",
    "for the equivalent widths , a large part of the uncertainties come from the continuum fitting , especially since some of the lines are sitting on the edge of the galaxy s ly@xmath2 damped wing .",
    "hence the errors as presented in table  [ tab3 ] are the sums in quadrature of the uncertainties ( 1@xmath37 ) from photon noise and the estimated errors from different reasonable placements of the continuum fit .",
    "the continuum signal - to - noise per resolution element in our spectra in the region of the expected or detected absorption ranges from 2.2 to 12 , since our target qsos have a wide range of fluxes ( the lowest s / n of 2.2 is for pks1103 - 009 which had a detected flux of only 3/5 of the value estimated from iue data ) .      to compare the five detections of ly@xmath2 absorptions in spectra of background qsos with the associated galaxy s kinematics we needed its velocity field and rotation curve . for ngc5033 and ugc8146",
    "these were available in the litterature ( begeman 1987 ; rhee & van albada 1996 ) . for the other 3 galaxies we carried out very large array ( vla ) hi observations , for which the observational parameters are summarized in table  [ tab4 ] .",
    "the correlator was set to a 3.125 mhz bandwidth with 128 channels , for a channel separation of 5.2 .",
    "the calibration and reductions were performed with the nrao package aips , following standard procedures .",
    "the absolute flux calibration was determined by observing the standard source 1331 + 305 . after applying calibration and bandpass corrections to the _ uv _",
    "databases , the continuum emission was subtracted in the visibility domain using channels free of line emission .",
    "several sets of maps were produced for each galaxy , one with uniform weighting preserving the best resolution , and a few with natural weigthing smoothed to various larger beams .",
    "these sets of maps were cleaned well into the noise by monitoring the total cleaned flux as a function of the total number of clean components recovered , and finally were restored with a circular symmetric gaussian beam .",
    "these maps were then corrected for the beam response of the antennae to rectify for attenuation away from the center of the primary beam .",
    "no hi emission was detected from other galaxies within the primary beam and through the bandwidth observed other than the intended source .",
    "moment maps were obtained from each datacube using hanning smoothing in velocity and gaussian smoothing spatially , to produce integrated total hi column density maps , intensity - weighted velocity maps , and velocity dispersion maps .",
    "hi rotation curves were obtained by fitting a tilted - ring model to the velocity fields ( begeman 1987 , ct 2000 ) , and are given in table  [ tab5 ] . in each case",
    "the rotation curves are slowly rising and just barely reach the flat part at the last measured points .",
    "the errors in velocity were calculated from half the difference between the velocities on each side ( receding and approaching ) or from the formal errors given by the least - squares fits , whichever were the highest .",
    "the rotation curves were derived with the systemic velocities and orientation parameters ( position angle and inclination ) set to the values shown in table  [ tab4 ] .",
    "the derived systemic velocities agree extremely well with the rc3 values , within 1 .",
    "the orientation parameters as well agree within a few degrees with those derived optically ( from the rc3 ) , which show that these galaxies do not have strong warps in their outer hi gaseous envelopes .",
    "the hi distributions and hi velocity fields are shown in figure  [ fig4 ] , and the gas suface density profiles in figure  [ fig5 ] , for which the hi surface density values were scaled by 4/3 to account for the presence of helium .",
    "although the three surface density profiles differ greatly , they are all within the range of what is commonly detected in late - type spirals .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] show the 5 ly@xmath9 absorption detections amongst our 9 target qsos , and table  [ tab3 ] gives their details .",
    "the target galaxy - qsos which give rise successfully to a ly@xmath9 detections have impact parameters from 55 kpc to 169 @xmath1  kpc , and the detections correspond to hi column densities ranging from log n@xmath38=13.0 to 13.9 @xmath8 . pg1309 + 355-ngc5033 with an impact parameter of 276 @xmath1  kpc , also give rise to a detection , however in this case it was later found that ngc5033 is part of a small loose group of galaxies and is surrounded by a swarm of dwarf galaxies , some of which are closer to the qso sightline than is ngc5033 ( eg .",
    ", ugc8261 , ugc8323 , ugc8314 ) ; and it is hence not possible to attribute the absorption detection to ngc5033 alone .",
    "we will return to this case later on .    in each case",
    "the ly@xmath9 line velocity matches extremely well the systemic center - of - mass velocities of the galaxies .",
    "in particular for pg 1259 + 593 and mrk 876 their ly@xmath9 absorption lines correspond to velocities of 679 and 935  ( respectively ) , which are the lowest redshift ly@xmath9 lines ever detected so far in association with nearby galaxies .",
    "presumably closer galaxies , e.g. m31 , could produce ly@xmath9 lines of even lower redshift but they would be impractical to detect because of the damped wing of the milky way galaxy absorbing away all the continuum flux .",
    "in fact in figure  [ fig2 ] , in all our spectra , the slope of the galaxy s damped wing is clearly seen , ie : the ly@xmath9 detections are sitting inside the range covered by the galaxy s damped wing which extends to at least @xmath3 1220  , sometimes 1222  .    as for the ly@xmath2 non - detections , they occur for galaxy - qso separations ranging from 162 to 387 @xmath1  kpc .",
    "their 3@xmath37 limiting equivalent width is in each case above the level needed to detect an absorption line even weaker than the ones detected in the other five spectra . in terms of hi",
    "column density limits it corresponds to a 3@xmath37 detection limit around log n@xmath38=13.1 @xmath8 on average .",
    "this at first sight thus appears to confirm the findings of several studies of moderately low redshift galaxy surveys associated with absorbers , which seem to point to most galaxies being surrounded by tenuous gas out to @xmath16 240 @xmath1 kpc .",
    "chen ( 1998 ) and ( 2001 ) , in a continuation of the work of lanzetta ( 1995 ) , find for 34 galaxies and absorbers pairs at z=0.07 to 0.89 with impact parameters @xmath39 from roughly 16 to 233 @xmath1 kpc , a near unity covering factor for tenuous gas halos around typical l@xmath40 galaxies out to a radius of @xmath3 240 @xmath1 kpc .",
    "furthermore chen ( 1998 ) found that the absorbing gas equivalent width depends on the galaxy - qso impact parameter as well as the galaxy b - band luminosity , which if true would greatly strengthen the case for a direct association between the absorber and its nearest galaxy .",
    "meanwhile bowen ( 1996 ) found that for 38 galaxies at z=0 to 0.08 lying at @xmath0 400@xmath41 kpc from a sightline of a bright qso observable with fos , for lines with equivalent widths @xmath42 0.3the covering factor is 44% between 67 to 400 @xmath1 kpc .",
    "recently bowen ( 2002 ) detected ly@xmath9 lines in the outer regions of all eight nearby galaxies probed , with impact parameters up to 265 @xmath1 kpc , down to @xmath43 .",
    "our results concord with these studies .",
    "all of our detections occur at impact parameter @xmath0 180 @xmath1 kpc from the nearest galaxy , and only one of our non - detections occurs for @xmath44 180 @xmath1 kpc ( pks1103 - 006 - ngc3521 at @xmath39=162 @xmath1 kpc ) .",
    "note however that there is considerable uncertainty in the values of @xmath39 due to the distance dependence ( see above ) .",
    "all these results seem very suggestive of a link between the detected absorbers and their neighboring galaxies .",
    "but one needs to look into the detailed kinematical match between the ly@xmath2 absorption line and the kinematics of the inner galaxy to probe more directly any direct link between an extended gaseous disk or halo of the galaxy and the absorber s velocity .      we will try to compare here the velocity of the qso ly@xmath9 system , with that of the associated galaxy . for 4 out of 5 detections ,",
    "the associated galaxy is confirmed to be isolated , hence the absorber can be unambiguously matched to this galaxy , assuming it is indeed due to a galaxy . for 3 of these galaxies",
    ", ugc4238 , ugc7697 and ngc6140 , we obtained the hi rotation curves ( section 3 ) .",
    "the 4th one , ugc8146 , has been observed by the westerbork synthesis radio telescope and its rotation curve was extracted from rhee & van albada ( 1996 ) .",
    "to compare the inner galaxy dynamics with the velocity measured by the ly@xmath2 line , we will assume that the line does indeed arise in the extended gaseous disk of the galaxy and see how well it matches the velocities of the hi rotation curve in that case .",
    "the observed radial velocity of the line , @xmath45 , is related to the corresponding rotation velocity @xmath46 in the disk of the galaxy by : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the systemic velocity of the galaxy , @xmath49 is its inclination , and @xmath50 where the qso has coordinates , in the plane of the sky , of x along the galaxy major axis , and y along the minor axis , with @xmath51 r is the radius in the plane of the galaxy at which the measurement lies , in other words , the deprojected impact parameter of the qso ( a figure demonstrating these formulae is provided in kerr & de vaucouleurs 1955 , in which however the inclination angle is defined as @xmath49=0 for an edge - on galaxy contrary to the modern convention ) . for the orientation parameters of our galaxies we have used those derived from the fits to their hi velocity fields .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows the resulting rotation curves .",
    "the inner points show the velocities obtained from the hi velocity fields , and the single outer point is from the ly@xmath2 detection .",
    "the plotted curves are simply the best fits cdm models ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 ) to the inner rotation curve , and serve to guide the eyes to what velocities might be expected in these outer parts ( note that such cdm curves are actually bad fits to observed rotation curves in the inner parts , see , e.g. ct 2000 , but here we just need them as rough approximations for the outer parts ) .",
    "the rotation curves in every case just reach the flat part at the very last measured point(s ) ( see table  [ tab5 ] ) . each case",
    "is discussed separately below .",
    "ngc 6140 is the only galaxy for which the ly@xmath2 velocity could be reasonably reconciled with the value expected if indeed arising from an extended gaseous corotating disk .",
    "although the ly@xmath2 line velocity is much lower than the maximum rotation velocity @xmath52 of the inner rotation curve , or than the velocity expected from cdm models at that radius , there are some ways to make it consistent with a disk velocity at that radius . for example",
    "a strong warp in the orientation parameters of the galaxy in the outer parts would change the deprojection factors and hence the calculated ly@xmath2 rotation velocity could rise to match the expected value . the present ly@xmath2 velocity was calculated using the hi orientation parameters .",
    "one would need a warp as large as about 40  in inclination , or alternatively of 22  in inclination and -31  in position angle , to bring the velocity in line with the disk expected one .",
    "most galaxies are observed to be warped in their outer parts , but such strong warps are rare for isolated galaxies .",
    "but although unusually large , one can not a priori dismiss the possibility of such a warp in ngc6140 .",
    "another possibility to consider is if the disk , and the dark matter halo as well , of ngc6140 are truncated -for whatever reasons- just outside the radius of the last measured point in hi . in this case",
    "the velocities in the outer parts should follow a keplerian fall - off , and the velocity expected at the radius of the ly@xmath2 velocity would fall to about 46.2 , close to the measured @xmath34=36.2 @xmath29 5 .",
    "finally another possibility is that the velocity measured is not due to gas actually in the disk plane , but from material at a certain @xmath53 height in a thick disk or halo . assuming a thick rotating disk in which the circular velocities decrease rapidly as a function of scale height , @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the velocity in the disk midplane and @xmath56 is a velocity scale height",
    ", then one can easily recover from the model a lower velocity like the one observed here by choosing an appropriate value of @xmath56 . except in the case of",
    "an infinitely large @xmath56 where the thick disk is corotating cylindrically , the velocities at some @xmath53 distance will be much lower than the midplane one this is observed in ngc  891 for example , in which some hi halo gas extending up to 5 kpc from the plane is seen to rotate 25 to 100 more slowly than the gas in the plane ( swaters , sancisi & van der hulst 1997 ) .",
    "hence the observed ly@xmath2 velocity of ngc6140 would not be at all unphysical but would simply reflect the presence of a rotating thick disk ( with detectable gas only at higher z height , and none in the plane of the disk ) . for the moment , with only one sightline velocity at large radius ,",
    "it is not possible to discriminate between these various possibilities and confirm any of them .",
    "the situation for ugc4238 and ugc8146 is different . in these two cases , assuming planar kinematics",
    ", the measured ly@xmath2 velocity corresponds to a circular velocity actually larger than the expected cdm one or even the @xmath52 reached by the inner rotation curve .",
    "a very significant increase of rotation velocity with radius would be required to explain the observed velocity .",
    "however one can again invoke warps to make the observed velocity consistent with the extrapolation of the inner disk rotation .",
    "in fact in these two cases , because of the particular orientation parameters of the galaxies and their angle with respect to their associated quasars sightline , one would need only mild warps ( of the order of 10  in the suitable direction ) to make the match .",
    "consequently one can still not dismiss a priori the possibility that the absorptions indeed arise from co - rotating gaseous extensions of the inner disks , albeit non - planar motions .",
    "the qso , ton1542 , is situated at the south - west of the galaxy ; the observed velocity ( @xmath57 ) is greater than the systemic velocity ( @xmath48=2536 ) ; yet the galaxy s approaching side is towards the west , meaning the velocities should all be smaller than @xmath48 . the observed velocity from the absorption line is counter - rotating with respect to the disk velocities .",
    "and the observed velocities and geometry of the case of ugc7697 are such that warps can not provide consistency with an extended gas disk .",
    "unusually large warps would be required to reverse the inclination of the disk on the sky so that counter - rotation is observed , and such twisted rotating disks would be unlikely to be stable ( with the exception of nearly face - on galaxies where the reversal of the inclination would be easier to achieve ; see for example cohen 1979 or appleton , foster & davies 1986 , where such a possibility is discussed to explain the apparent velocity reversals in ic10 and m51 ) .",
    "counter - rotation at very large radii has been observed in hi in a few galaxies , but those are always galaxies interacting with a nearby dwarf ( for example ngc4449 , hunter 1998 ) or which also harbour inner counter - rotation and hence easily stand out morphologically ( like ngc4826 , the evil - eye galaxy , braun 1994 ) .",
    "neither of these cases apply here for any of the galaxies in our sample . in the case of ugc7697",
    "no amount of disk thickening , or warps could explain the discrepancy ( unless abnormally large ) .",
    "there are simply no physical way to produce such a velocity with an extended corotating disk .",
    "this is sobering because ugc7697 is one of the galaxies for which the qso is at the smallest impact parameter , and yet the absorption s velocity does not match .",
    "it is also interesting to note from figure 1 that for ugc7697 the qso lies close to the projected optical major axis in angle ( compared to the other galaxies ) .",
    "if the gas has a higher column density in the disk than in the halo we should have expected a clear detection of the rotating hi disk of ugc7697 , if it does reach out to this radius at the @xmath58 level .    note that some have invoked the existence of very low - surface brightness galaxies or dwarf galaxies , undetected in the optical , which could lie closer to the qso sightline than the apparently nearest galaxy and from which the ly@xmath2 line would originate . in the case of ugc7697",
    "this is very unlikely since we also acquired deep hi pointings with the vla on all of our qsos fields and should have detected such galaxies , down to a few 10@xmath59 ( to be presented in a forthcoming paper ) .",
    "our conclusion that the ly@xmath2 absorptions can not arise in simple extended disks are confirmed by two other galaxies associated with ly@xmath2 absorbers taken from the literature , for which similar results are found .",
    "bowen , pettini , and blades ( 2002 ) targeted a sample of eight nearby galaxies near the sightlines of qsos and agns .",
    "most of their galaxies are not isolated ( contrasting with the careful selection criteria of our sample ) , but are part of binary pairs or small groups ( their sample was produced by cross - correlating the rc3 with the veron - cetty & veron ( 1996 ) catalog , and choosing galaxies with @xmath42 1300 , and with impact parameters to qsos of less than 200 @xmath60 kpc ) .",
    "however two galaxies , ngc988 and ngc3942 are reasonably isolated , at least on the scale of a few hundreds of kpc .",
    "their projected separations from their associated qsos are 211 and 123  @xmath1 kpc respectively , and no other galaxies are known around a diameter of 400 kpc from these qso sightlines .",
    "unfortunately no rotation curves , either optical ( in h@xmath2 ) or hi , are available for these two galaxies .",
    "but for the sake of comparing the inner galaxy s kinematics with the ly@xmath2 absorption velocity , we can use ngc988 and ngc3942 s magnitude to derive approximate rotation curves , using the universal rotation curve of persic & salucci ( 1996 ) ( where they obtained , based on a sample of 1100 rotation curves , a relation between the shape and amplitude of a rotation curve , and the luminosity of the galaxy ) .",
    "we will see below that these approximations are more than satisfactory to be able to draw our conclusions .",
    "the ly@xmath2 line velocities observed in the spectra of mrk1048 and pg1149 - 110 respectively are taken from bowen ( 2002 ) .",
    "one last important piece of information needed to compare the inner and outer velocities is that the sense of rotation of the galaxy must be known , ie .",
    "we must determine if the qso lies behind the approaching or the receding side of the galaxy ( otherwise it is not known if the velocity difference is due to corotation or counter - rotation ) .",
    "this might be difficult to establish without a proper 2d velocity field for these two galaxies .",
    "fortunately ngc988 and ngc3942 are reasonably nearby and extended in angular size , and hence their hi envelope should be at least a few arcmins in diameter . in that case",
    "it is possible to detect the change in shape of the hi global profile at different positions around the galaxy in the hipass scans ( hipass is the all - southern - sky hi survey performed with the parkes multibeam receiver and available on - line , barnes 2001 ) . by retrieving the hi profiles on each side of the galaxy ( the pointings in the on - line catalog are separated by roughly 8 arcmins from each other ) , it is possible to follow the change from a double - peak profile for ngc988 ( with a systemic velocity of 1504 ) to a single peak roughly at 1400  at the east to one around 1600  at the west , and hence determine that for ngc988 the approaching side is at the east and the receding one at the west . similarly for ngc3942 the approaching side is seen to be in the south - east and the receding one in the northwest . with this information one",
    "can then plot the rotation curves of figure  [ fig7 ] .",
    "they confirm the findings on our galaxies above .",
    "because for ngc988 the velocity difference between the ly@xmath2 absorption line and the systemic velocity of the galaxy is already quite large , this translates into a rotation velocity ( with the appropriate deprojections ) which is ridiculously too elevated ( @xmath611192 ) , and no amount of warping , no matter how severe , can bring this velocity down to a value close to v@xmath62 .",
    "for ngc3942 the calculated rotation velocity is also inadequate , as we find here another case of counter - rotation .",
    "again ngc3942 has a relatively small impact parameter to the ly@xmath2 line , compared to those in our sample , with the projected distance corresponding to 147 @xmath1 kpc , and yet already at that radius we do not detect any longer the extended corotating gaseous disk of the galaxy .      could it be that somehow , although not in a corotating disk or halo , this detected gas is still associated to the galaxy ?",
    "after all the milky way is known to be surrounded by high - velocity - clouds , which can have velocities above , or below , the galaxy s rotation velocity by several hundred  ( see , e.g. wakker 1991 ) .",
    "following strong supernovae events some ejected gas might hide into a hot phase until eventually it cools down and could then be detected to low column densities in our sightlines at very large radii .",
    "multiple supernovae remnants can drive a superbubble evolving quickly into a blowout , leaving a hole in the galactic disk ( eg .",
    "maclow & mccray 1988 ) .",
    "some gas can even be accelerated beyond the escape velocity and be blown - away , completely unbound from the galactic potential ( de young & heckman 1994 ) . for small dwarf galaxies ,",
    "for which it is easier to escape the potential , it might be possible to generate large ( 100 kpc size ) gaseous halos with supernovae - driven winds ( nath & trentham 1997 ) . for larger galaxies",
    "it is expected that there should be a local circulation of gas ( to a few scalelengths above the disk ) via a fountain - type flow ( shapiro & field 1976 ) .",
    "however it might be unlikely though to blow gas out of a more normal galaxy ( closer to @xmath63 ) to distances of more than 100 kpc , corresponding to factors of up to 7.5 times the diameter of the galaxy -as is the case here for ngc6140 .",
    "another possibility is that we are intercepting satellites objects ( very small galaxies or clouds of gas ) orbiting around the primary galaxy .",
    "this would explain the counter - rotating velocities , as satellite objects can have retrograde as well as prograde orbits .",
    "in fact in the study of the supermassive disk galaxy ngc5084 orbited by a record number of 9 satellite dwarf galaxies ( carignan 1997 ) , the large majority of the satellite objects ( 7 out of 9 ) are on retrograde orbits .",
    "the problem with this explanation though is the overly large covering factor of the detected gas for impact parameters @xmath0 160 kpc . in the bowen ( 2002 )",
    "study they find a detection for _ all _ qsos at impact parameters @xmath0265 @xmath1kpc ( down to @xmath64 0.11  ) , and in our case all qsos at @xmath0 136 @xmath1 kpc yield a detection .",
    "it would thus be very unlikely that by chance the sightlines always intercept one of the satellites , considering especially the range of orientation parameters of the targets .",
    "moreover these satellite objects would have to have very unusual properties compared to other dwarf galaxies , since we have deep vla hi pointings of all our fields in which we would have detected any objects above about 10@xmath13 m@xmath65 ( to be presented elsewhere ) .",
    "another important clue in constraining the nature of the detected ly@xmath2 absorbers is the inspection of the lines equivalent widths .",
    "a strong argument in favour of the extended galactic disks origin of the ly@xmath2 lines has been the apparent anti - correlation between equivalent width and impact parameter for the lines , the absorption being stronger the closer it is to the galaxy ( lanzetta 1995 ) . the chen ( 1998 )",
    "study find also a dependence on the luminosity of the galaxy , of the form : @xmath66 meaning that brighter galaxies would have stronger absorptions at a given radius .",
    "tripp ( 1998 ) discussed a few possible selection biases that could explain this anti - correlation .",
    "most interestingly bowen ( 2002 ) plotted this relation for their 8 nearby galaxy - qso pairs and found that the chen luminosity dependence is not confirmed .",
    "in fact they found a correlation in the _ opposite _ sense , significant at the 2.8@xmath37 level , implying that stronger absorbing lines are associated with fainter galaxies .",
    "they concluded that this relation is probably coicidental , simply a result of small number statistics . in our data , with four points , we find a dependence in - between that of chen ( 1998 ) and bowen ( 2002 ) , in fact it is consistent with no dependence on luminosity .",
    "meanwhile the hydrodynamical simulations of dav ( 1999 ) have been able to succesfully reproduce the anti - correlation of equivalent widths and impact parameters in the context of the cosmic web .",
    "they showed that the cosmic gas which loosely trace the large scale structure will have 3 phases : the strongest absorbers arise near galaxies because the gas is denser there ; the majority of the absorbers will arise at impact parameters between 40 and 360 @xmath1kpc from shock - heated gas around galaxies ; and at impact parameters further than 360 @xmath1kpc the absorbers will be associated with a cooler diffuse gas component .",
    "this is corroborated by another interesting correlation , plotted by bowen ( 2002 ) , between the equivalent widths and the local volume density of galaxies .",
    "for each of the sightlines they calculated the total equivalent width by summing all lines within @xmath29 500 , and plotted them against the number of galaxies with @xmath67 in a cylinder of 2 @xmath68 mpc radius with a length equal to the distance between + 500  and -500  from the ly@xmath2 line .",
    "their choice of @xmath69 was dictated by the limiting apparent magnitude for completeness in the rc3 along their sightlines .",
    "they find that the higher the density of @xmath70 galaxies in a given volume , the stronger the equivalent width of ly@xmath2 absorption over 1000 .",
    "this suggests that the strength of the ly@xmath2 absorbers are not related to their nearest galaxy neighbour but rather to the overall volume density of galaxies within a few mpc of the sightline .    in figure  [ fig8 ]",
    "is plotted similarly our l@xmath2 lines versus the estimated volume density of galaxies around our targets . following bowen ( 2002 ) we summed all components of ly@xmath2 absorption within + 500  and -500  from the main ly@xmath2 line . only in one case ( pg0804 + 761 ) was there another ly@xmath2 absorber to add up within that range .",
    "we considered similarly only galaxies with @xmath67 within a 2 @xmath68 mpc radius and within + 500  and -500  in the rc3 .",
    "our data agree very well with the bowen ( 2002 ) result , within errors ( our errors in @xmath71 are simply @xmath72 ) .",
    "the sightline to ton1542 goes through the least dense area ( with only 2 bright enough galaxies within the 2 @xmath68 mpc radius ) and the ly@xmath2 line is indeed the weakest of all our targets . on the other hand ,",
    "the sightline to pg1309 + 355 and close to ngc5033 is surrounded by galaxies ( in fact we had to a posteriori eliminate ngc5033 from the rotation curve analysis precisely because of this , there are too many other galaxies close to the qso and hence it was not possible to attribute the ly@xmath2 detection to a galaxy in particular ) . and the ly@xmath2 line in the spectrum of pg1309 + 355 is by far the strongest and most complex , blending several components into a line with total equivalent width of 1.14 @xmath29 0.09  .",
    "the other three sightlines , with small equivalent widths , fall in - between the former and the latter in terms of volume density of galaxies .",
    "the three datapoints are all lying at higher volume density than the bowen  points of similar equivalent width , but considering the small number statistics here it is probably not a significant offset .",
    "these galaxies all lie at smaller systemic velocities than those studied by bowen so it is possible that the neighborhoods of these local galaxies have been better surveyed . on the other hand",
    "these galaxies are so close ( @xmath73 ) that the estimation of the galaxy volume density by adding all galaxies within + 500  and -500  probably does not make much sense considering the large deviations from a smooth hubble flow that are seen at these small distances from us .    while the choice of 2 @xmath68 mpc radius for estimating the galaxy volume density in bowen ( 2002 ) was rather arbitrary , the limiting @xmath70 was guided by the estimated completeness to @xmath74 of the rc3 for the furthest targets of their sample . in our case because our galaxies are closer we can inspect the volume density down to a fainter limit using the rc3 .",
    "in fact we know that our strongest line , for pg1309 + 355 , is surrounded by dwarf galaxies in close proximity , but which were not counted in the previous volume density estimate because they were of lower magnitude than the @xmath67 .",
    "for figure  [ fig9 ] we have recomputed volume densities of galaxies down to @xmath75 , which corresponds to a @xmath74 for our sample objects , and in a smaller cylinder of 0.5 @xmath68 mpc radius .",
    "again the relation holds very well , although we are dealing with even smaller number statistics .",
    "it thus appear that there is a relationship between the ly@xmath2 column density along a sightline and the surrounding volume density of galaxies .",
    "this makes sense if the absorbers are simply part of the cosmic web .",
    "the galaxies have condensed in the densest parts of this network of filaments and sheets of gas , and hence the ly@xmath2 detections will be denser when crossing a web filament / sheet rich in galaxies .",
    "the ly@xmath9 absorbers are only detected within about @xmath76 @xmath1  kpc down to our limiting equivalent widths in the neighbourhood of galaxies because that is where the gas has higher column density in the filament , in the dense region from which the galaxy has condensed .",
    "on a larger scale , the ly@xmath9 line will be stronger when crossing the core of a filament , or a busy intersection of filaments of the web , where one finds a higher density of galaxy , on a scale of 2 @xmath68 mpc radius .",
    "that the relationship seems to still hold on the smaller scale of 0.5 @xmath68 mpc radius when considering the density of lower luminosity galaxies ( figure  [ fig9 ] ) is perhaps not surprising , as small groups of galaxies ( like the agglomeration around pg1309 + 355 ) tend to be found on the periphery of larger clusters while most of our other targets are probably in semi - void regions ( since galaxies were purposely selected to be isolated for the aim of this project ) .",
    "it is not obvious what should be the relevant scale to calculate the surrounding galaxy density . in simulations of the cosmic web ,",
    "the filaments come in various thickness although are definitly of the order of the mpc , down to the detectable column densities as here ( miralda - escud 1996 , dav 1999 ) .",
    "observations of double qsos sightlines also find that , by looking at ly@xmath2 lines in common in both spectra , the typical scale is around 0.5 mpc ( dinshaw 1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "it is interesting to look also at the doppler @xmath77 parameters from the voigt profile fits and compared them to those obtained by bowen ( 2002 ) ( keeping in mind that some @xmath77 values are uncertain because of the @xmath78 degeneracy for saturated lines ) . in most of their sightlines",
    "several resolved ly@xmath2 lines were added up ( within their + 500 and -500  limit ) to add up to the total equivalent widths plotted in figure  [ fig8 ] . in constrast , for most of our sample , the total equivalent widths come mostly from a single line .",
    "pg0804 + 761 is an exception , for which two lines were added , and also because the main line associated with the galaxy ( ie . which matches more closely in velocity )",
    "is better fitted by two profiles rather than one .",
    "similarly for pg1309 + 355 , the profile , which has the highest equivalent width of all , is very broad and show several features , and the fit is considerably improved by fitting 3 voigt profiles rather than a single one .",
    "interestingly the trend of figure  [ fig8 ] holds well whether one is considering the addition of several narrow lines ( typically @xmath79 ) in the case of the bowen ( 2002 ) sample , or the denser , wider single @xmath77 lines from our sample .",
    "one can not exclude that our single lines are actually unresolved groups of narrower lines . if not there might be a real physical difference in the density and temperature of the cosmic web gas depending on the environment , since our galaxies were mostly selected to be isolated , while the bowen ( 2002 ) ones are part of pairs or small groups .",
    "the bowen ( 2002 ) lines are also at redshifts on average twice as distant than for our sample . while some evolution with redshift is expected for the density of the cosmic web , since at lower redshift more of the gas will have condensed along the filaments ( dav 1999 ) , the two samples discussed here probably do not cover a wide enough range in redshift to see this .",
    "our @xmath77 values go up to about 150 , unusually large for ly@xmath2 forest absorption lines , although a few of the bowen ( 2002 ) sample do reach similar values .",
    "if the lines are indeed composed of only a single component , and assuming that the linewidth is purely due to the gas kinetic temperature ( in which case @xmath80 with @xmath81 being the boltzmann constant and @xmath82 the proton mass ) , then this would represent absorption from hot gas at a temperature of @xmath83 , in our cases @xmath84 to @xmath85k .    based on these relationships",
    "it thus appears that the cosmic web is the most likely explanation for the origin of our ly@xmath2 absorption - line detections .",
    "thus the positive ly@xmath2 detections , despite appearing in proximity to the target galaxies , are not directly related to these galactic disks , but only indirectly related because of the way that these galaxies are positionned in the large scale structure of the cosmic web .",
    "sightlines of qsos at impact parameters 55 to 387 @xmath1  kpc from nine nearby galaxies ( at systemic velocities from 566 to 5538 ) were probed , using ghrs and stis . in five cases",
    "a ly@xmath2 absorption line was successfully detected at a velocity coincident with the galaxy s .",
    "some of these ly@xmath2 lines are the lowest - redshifts ly@xmath2 lines ever detected , and in fact most of them are sitting on the wing of the milky way ly@xmath2 damped line ( hence introducing uncertainties in the derived equivalent widths ) .",
    "the positive detections occur for qso - galaxy pairs with separations from 55 to 169 @xmath1  kpc , while non - detections are for pairs with separations from 162 to 387 @xmath1  kpc .",
    "although at first sight it appears that the ly@xmath2 lines might be genuinely arising in the extended disks of the target galaxies , this is not what transpires from inspecting the detailed kinematics of these galaxies .",
    "hi velocity fields were obtained at the vla for our galaxies ( and in one case was available from the literature ) , to derive their rotation curves . when comparing the inner rotation curves of the galaxies with the velocity at large radius provided by the ly@xmath2 line it appears that it is very difficult to explain this ly@xmath2 velocity as part of the extended gaseous rotating disk .",
    "in most cases one would need to invoke large warps in the extreme outer gas disks to reconcile the observed velocities with the predicted ones .",
    "worse , in some cases the ly@xmath2 line velocity indicates in fact counter - rotation with respect to the inner disk rotation .    in light of these results it appears that there is no detectable gas , down to levels of about 10@xmath17 @xmath8 , corotating in an extended gaseous disk at radii @xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "the cosmic web is the most likely origin for the detected ly@xmath2 lines .",
    "the observed equivalent widths of the lines are consistent with this picture .",
    "indeed the equivalent widths are correlated with the local volume density of galaxies around the sightline .",
    "this makes sense if the ly@xmath2 lines arise from the cosmic web , which is denser in regions of higher volume density of galaxies ( since the galaxies have formed by condensating in the denser parts of the network ) .",
    "this correlation would be difficult to explain if the ly@xmath2 lines arised from halos or extended disks of the most nearby galaxy .",
    "one could argue that the equivalent widths should be larger for sighlines close to larger galaxies , which tend to be found in regions of higher galaxy volume density , which could then explain the trend observed .",
    "however if this were the case then one would observe presumably an even stronger correlation between the equivalent widths and the luminosity of the nearby galaxy , and although this was reported to be the case by chen ( 1998 ) it is now clearly contested by the results of bowen ( 2002 ) , as well as in our sample for which no correlation is found between equivalent widths and luminosities .    note",
    "that these results do not necessarily imply that the dark matter haloes of these galaxies do not exist at the radii probed by our qso sightlines .",
    "it simply means that there is no longer some detectable gas in rotation in an extended gas disk at these radii , and that the ly@xmath2 lines detected are due to foreground or background cosmic web gas surrounding the galaxy .",
    "in fact weak lensing studies seem to indicate that indeed the dark matter halo extend very far out , typically @xmath42 300 @xmath1kpc for a @xmath63 galaxy ( eg . the weak - lensing studies such as smith 2001 ) .",
    "but there is no gas to trace its dynamics out there , at least down to our limiting column densities .",
    "hi as traced by background qsos is therefore not a useful tracer of galactic potential in the far outer regions of a @xmath16200 kpc halo",
    ". only weak lensing , and perhaps h@xmath2 in recombination from the extended ionized disk ( bland - hawthorn 1997 ) are hopeful tracers of dynamics at such radii .",
    "these qsos turn out however to be extremely useful to probe the phases of the cosmic web gas .",
    "many more sightlines will be required though before one can attempt to understand the cosmic gas distribution and density , as well as its evolution with redshift .",
    "the planned hst cos spectrograph would have allowed to probe the sightlines of fainter qsos which would greatly increase the available sample , and hopefully the decision regarding hst can be reversed in the future . eventually the next generation of sensitive giant radio telescopes as the clar ( ct 2002 ) and eventually the ska , will be able to survey efficiently large areas of the sky down to colum densities as deep as 10@xmath86 @xmath8 , and hence trace directly in emission the structure of such low column density gas in the cosmic web .",
