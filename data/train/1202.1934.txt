    "the telescope array ( ta ) experiment is designed to observe extensive air showers caused by ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) , using air fluorescence telescopes and an air shower array installed in the west desert of utah , usa @xcite .",
    "an important scientific objective of the ta experiment is to measure the energy spectrum of cosmic rays in the ultra - high energy region , where a cutoff structure generated by the interaction of uhecrs with the cosmic microwave background has been predicted by greissen , zatsepin and kuzmin ( gzk ) @xcite .",
    "a measurement reported by the agasa experiment in 1998 showed a spectrum that extended beyond the expected gzk cutoff @xcite .",
    "the hires experiment recently reported a strong suppression of cosmic ray flux @xcite at around the predicted energy of 10@xmath0  ev @xcite , which was also observed by the pierre auger observatory @xcite .",
    "a precise measurement of the cutoff energy and the spectral shape around the cutoff is crucial to the identification of the origin of the observed structure , i.e. , whether it is caused by the gzk effect or by some other mechanism such as the acceleration limit of cosmic rays .",
    "answering this question is an important objective of the ta experiment .",
    "the ta consists of two different types of detectors .",
    "an air shower array covers a ground area of about 700  km@xmath1 with 507 scintillator surface detectors ( sds ) deployed in a grid of 1.2  km spacing .",
    "the spectral shape of uhecrs can be measured with good accuracy by the sd .",
    "it is fully efficient for the trigger and event reconstruction above 10@xmath2  ev .",
    "three fluorescence detector ( fd ) stations , each with 12 - 14 fluorescence telescopes , view the sky over the surface array from the periphery ( figure  [ fig : ta_layout ] ) .",
    "the energies of uhecr events can be reliably determined by the fd because it directly measures the energy deposit in the atmosphere generated by air showers .",
    "the energy determination by the fd is affected by several experimental uncertainties such as the fluorescence spectrum and yield , the atmospheric attenuation of fluorescence photons , the photometric calibration of the telescope , and the missing energy carried away by high energy muons and neutrinos . in this paper , we address the third uncertainty , i.e. , the photometric calibration of the pmts used for the fd camera .",
    "one of the three fd stations of the ta , middle drum ( md ) , is located to the north of the sd array ( figure  [ fig : ta_layout ] ) .",
    "the telescopes at the md site are refurbished hires @xcite telescopes .",
    "a calibration procedure similar to that employed by hires using a xenon flasher was applied to the fds in md .",
    "the role of md is to import the established energy scale of previous experiments ( hires-1 , hires-2 , and fly s eye ) to the ta .",
    "the other two fd stations , i.e. , black rock mesa ( brm ) in the southeast and long ridge ( lr ) in the southwest , were newly produced for the ta experiment @xcite . a spherical mirror ( diameter 3.3  m ) and an imaging camera ( 16 @xmath3 16 pmt matrix )",
    "are installed in the fds of brm and lr .",
    "the field of view of one telescope is 18@xmath4 in azimuth and 15.5@xmath4 in elevation .",
    "a combination of 6 @xmath3 2 telescopes at each station provides a field of view of 108@xmath4 in azimuth and 3@xmath4@xmath533@xmath4 in elevation .    for the new telescopes at brm and lr , we calibrated a combination of pmt and readout electronics using a pulsed uv light source developed specially for this purpose",
    "this system is composed of a pulsed nitrogen laser and a gas - filled chamber in which laser photons are scattered by the gas molecules and detected by a pmt to be calibrated .",
    "we call it crays ( calibration using rayleigh scattering ) . in this paper",
    ", we describe the development of crays and the absolute photometric calibration of the fd camera pmts via crays .",
    "a photograph of the pmt assembly used for the fd camera is shown in figure  [ fig : pmt_photo ] .",
    "the pmt ( r9508 , hamamatsu photonics ) has a hexagonal photo - sensitive window with the opposite side distance of 60  mm .",
    "the pmt has a typical quantum efficiency of 27% for @xmath6 = 337.1  nm ( the laser wavelength ) and a collection efficiency of 90% as reported by the manufacturer .",
    "the gains of all the pmts were adjusted at @xmath76.0  @xmath3  10@xmath8 as described later in this paper .",
    "a uv transparent filter ( bg3 , schott ag ) of 4  mm thickness is attached to the pmt window .",
    "its transmittance is measured to be 89% for @xmath6 = 337  nm @xcite .",
    "the signal from the pmt is amplified by a factor of 52.7 at the pmt base and is sent to a signal digitizer and finder ( sdf ) module @xcite using a 25 m long twisted pair cable .",
    "the waveform is digitized by a 12-bit , 40  mhz flash adc ( fadc ) with 2.0 v full scale .",
    "four consecutive digitizations of the same input signal are summed together by the field programmable gate array ( fpga ) in the sdf , and the data of 14-bit dynamic range is read out .",
    "the overall schematics of the fd pmt calibration at the ta is shown in figure  [ fig : calib_schematics ] .",
    "we calibrated 75 pmts using crays in a laboratory at the institute for cosmic ray research ( icrr ) , university of tokyo , in japan .",
    "the crays - calibrated pmts were transported to the ta experimental site in utah , and installed into the fd cameras - one calibrated pmt at the center of each camera ( standard pmt ) and another calibrated pmt toward the corner of the camera to monitor the behavior of the standard pmt .",
    "the same high voltage ( hv ) , as determined by the crays calibration at the icrr , was applied to the standard pmt at the ta site .",
    "using a diffused xenon flasher @xcite in situ , we adjusted the hvs of all other pmts ( 255 units ) in the camera such that the gains of these pmts are equal to the standard pmt .",
    "all the pmts calibrated via crays have a small yap light pulser ( diameter 4  mm ) @xcite embedded in a hole at the center of the bg3 filter ( figure  [ fig : pmt_photo ] ) .",
    "the yap is composed of a yalo@xmath9:ce scintillator with 50 bq of @xmath10am applied on the surface .",
    "the yap generates a light flash ( wavelength @xmath7350  nm ; duration @xmath730  ns ) and produces approximately 450 photoelectrons in the pmt .",
    "the gains of the pmts calibrated via crays in the laboratory have been monitored in the field using the yap signal .",
    "the setup of crays is shown in figure  [ fig : crays ] .",
    "a pulsed laser beam is directed into a scattering chamber filled with a high purity gas ( @xmath1199.999% ) consisting of a single molecular species , either n@xmath12 or ar . scattered photons from the beam illuminate a pmt viewing the chamber through a window . since the gas is very pure and the molecules in the gas are much smaller than the wavelength used , the scattering process in the chamber is well described by molecular ( rayleigh ) scattering .",
    "the total number of photons in the laser pulse is calculated from the energy measured by a calibrated energy probe at the end of the beam line .",
    "the number of the rayleigh scattered photons is calculated using the cross - section formula , which has been experimentally verified to an accuracy of @xmath71% @xcite ( sections  [ sec : crosssection ] ) . with a typical setup of crays for nitrogen gas ( laser intensity 200  nj ; gas pressure 1000  hpa ) ,",
    "an intensity of approximately 80 photons / cm@xmath1 is obtained on the pmt window ( section  [ photonacc ] ) .",
    "uncertainties of the crays calibration are 0.3% ( statistical ) , 7.2% ( systematic ) , and 3.7% ( from transport to ta site ) as described in section  [ sec : syserrall ] .",
    "we note that the same crays setup was also used with much lower laser intensity for calibrating the icecube pmts in single photon counting mode @xcite .",
    "we used a nitrogen laser ( vsl-337nd - s , laser science , inc . ) as a light source ( wavelength 337.1  nm ; duration 4  ns ) .",
    "the maximum energy is 300 @xmath14j per pulse .",
    "the wavelength of the nitrogen laser matches that of the brightest air fluorescence line in the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the diameter of the laser beam was limited to @xmath71  mm by a set of irises at the exit of the laser and at the entrance of the scattering chamber .",
    "a remote - controlled shutter in the beam line prevented the laser light from entering the chamber , as required . a neutral density ( nd )",
    "filter was used to reduce the beam intensity .",
    "the reflected beam by the nd filter was measured by a pyro - electric energy probe ( rjp-435 , laser probe , inc . ) that monitored the relative intensity of the beam .",
    "the nitrogen laser is inherently depolarized . to eliminate an elliptical polarization introduced by the nd filter , a combination of a polarizer and a retardation plate ( @xmath6/4 ) was used to convert the beam into a circular polarization .",
    "the intensity of the beam in the scattering chamber was measured using a silicon photodiode energy probe ( rjp-465 , laser probe , inc . ) placed at the end of the beam line .",
    "both energy probes were calibrated with 5% absolute accuracy by the manufacturer .",
    "the energy measured by rjp-465 ranged from 190  nj to 220  nj with a typical pulse - to - pulse fluctuation of 3% as shown in figure  [ fig : laser_energy ] .",
    "the cylindrical scattering chamber has a diameter of 500  mm .",
    "the inner surface is anodized in black , and the inner wall is coated with non - reflective black paper to suppress stray light .",
    "the chamber was evacuated to @xmath73  hpa using a membrane vacuum pump ( dau-100 , ulvac , inc . ) before introducing the high purity scatterer gas .",
    "the differential pressure of the chamber with respect to the atmospheric pressure was monitored by a capacitance manometer ( boc edwards , barocel 600ab ) and the temperature inside the chamber was measured by a thermister thermometer .",
    "the pmt to be calibrated was installed just outside the chamber , as shown in figure  [ fig : crays ] .",
    "the distance from the center of the chamber to the pmt glass window was set to 312  mm .",
    "the pmt detects photons scattered by the gas molecules near the center of the chamber at a scattering angle ( @xmath15 ) of 90@xmath4 .",
    "the aperture of the pmt is limited by a slit ( width 38.9  mm ; height 10  mm ) located 37.5  mm away from the beam line .",
    "the aperture is further limited by a removable mask installed 7  mm in front of the pmt glass window .",
    "masks having a hole of 20.0  mm and 36.0  mm in diameter exposed only the central part of the pmt window where the uniformity is expected to be good .",
    "all chamber windows are made of caf@xmath12 with anti - reflection coating .",
    "a transmittance greater than 99% for @xmath6 = 337  nm was measured by the manufacturer .",
    "we used the same data acquisition electronics and cables used at the ta sites as much as possible with the exception of the high voltage power supply of the pmt .",
    "we verified the applied hvs were the same at the crays calibration and at the ta sites , using a reference resistor and a digital multi - meter .",
    "data acquisition was controlled using a pc that generated a trigger for the laser .",
    "the synchronization output of the laser was fed to the energy probes , and the energy readings of each laser shot were recorded by the pc .",
    "the pressure and the temperature of the chamber were also recorded for each calibration run .",
    "the waveform output from the pmt was transmitted to the digitizer module ( sdf ) installed in a vme crate .",
    "the synchronization signal from the laser was recorded by the sdf to define the signal integration interval in the off - line analysis . for yap data recording ,",
    "a trigger was generated in the sdf by the yap signal itself .",
    "the daq rate was approximately 20 hz for the crays run and 50 hz for the yap run .",
    "before using crays for calibration , we made the following investigations to ensure that the photons detected by the pmt originated from the rayleigh scattering of the laser beam and that the background photon was under control .",
    "first , the polarization of the beam was measured by temporarily inserting a rotatable polarization plate and recording the output of the energy probes at different rotation angles . in figure",
    "[ fig : polarization ] , the relative intensity of the laser beam measured by the downstream energy probe is plotted with respect to the change of the polarizer rotation angle @xmath16 .",
    "a fit to the sinusoidal curve @xmath17 was made with an amplitude @xmath18 and a phase @xmath19 as free parameters .",
    "the obtained values , @xmath18 = @xmath50.04 and @xmath19 = @xmath58@xmath4 , indicate an elliptical polarization of 4% in the axis 37@xmath4 away from the vertical - upward direction .",
    "an effect of the polarization on the number of expected rayleigh scattered photons in the crays setup is described in section  [ sec : uncertainty ] .",
    "next , the amount of the scattered photons and the pmt responses were measured by changing the pressure of the gas between 3 and 1013  hpa .",
    "the integration of the fadc signal and the pedestal subtraction were done in the same manner as described in sections  [ integration ] and  [ results ] .",
    "the result of the measurements for nitrogen and argon gas are shown in figure  @xmath20 .",
    "good linearities of the pmt output with respect to the change of the gas pressure were obtained both for nitrogen and argon .",
    "the argon to nitrogen ratio ( ar / n@xmath12 ) was 0.857 @xmath21 0.007 from a linear fit to the measured fadc counts and taking a ratio of the two slopes .",
    "the measured ratio is in a good agreement with the theoretical cross - section calculation , which predicts a value of 0.849 ( section  [ sec : crosssection ] ) .",
    "a signal of 16-photons - equivalent was detected in the vacuum setup .",
    "this is about 1.9% of the rayleigh scattered photons for the laser energy of 200  nj , measured with the pmt mask of 36  mm@xmath16 ( nitrogen gas ; pressure , 1000  hpa ) .",
    "this background without scatterer molecules in the crays chamber was attributed to the stray light generated by reflection of the laser by beam line elements such as the caf@xmath12 window and the energy probe .",
    "the background amount was stable during the calibration runs , and its contribution to the pmt signal was subtracted in the data analysis .",
    "finally , a linear polarization was artificially introduced in the beam line using the rotatable polarization plate , and the pmt signal was measured for different polarization angles .",

    "the number was less than one when a random ( isotropic ) scattering was assumed .",
    "because the scattering is expected to be close to lambertian on the black paper covering a major part of the chamber wall , we concluded that the effect of stray light originating from the rayleigh scattering in the beam line is negligible .",

    "an old measurement by shardanand and rao @xcite gave cross - section values for nitrogen and argon at 5 wavelengths from @xmath84  nm to @xmath85  nm , which are in agreement from expectations within @xmath86 ( figure  [ fig : crosssectionm ] ) .",
    "naus and ubachs firstly carried out a modern laboratory laser measurement of rayleigh scattering cross - sections of nitrogen and argon in @xmath87  nm with the cavity - ringdown technique @xcite .",
    "they compared their measured values of cross - section and the expectations from the formula  ( [ eq : rcrosssection ] ) with @xmath52 evaluated with ( [ eq : peck ] ) ( [ eq : larsen ] ) and @xmath53 by ( [ eq : bateskingc ] ) , and concluded that the measured and the calculated cross - sections agree within an experimental uncertainty of @xmath80 .",
    "they also gave an empirical expression for the rayleigh cross - section in a form @xmath88 by fitting their measured values to ( [ eq : csempirical ] ) they obtained @xmath89 and @xmath90 for nitrogen , and @xmath91 and @xmath92 for argon @xcite .",
    "this experiment was followed by the measurements in shorter wavelengths , as sneep and ubachs in @xmath93  nm @xcite , and ityaksov , linnartz and ubachs in @xmath94  nm @xcite .",
    "although there are few cross - section data available in the very vicinity of our interest , @xmath68  nm , the measured values both in the shorter and the longer wavelength ranges are in excellent agreement with the expectation from ( [ eq : rcrosssection ] ) within @xmath7 1% , and there is no evidence of non - validity of ( [ eq : rcrosssection ] ) at 337.1  nm .",
    "a list of systematic uncertainties for the calibration constant , @xmath44 ( 36  mm@xmath16 ) , obtained by crays is given in table  [ tb : sys_error ] .",
    "the calibration of pmts with crays is fully dependent on an evaluation of the total and differential cross - sections of rayleigh scattering , @xmath49 and @xmath95 , and its modification due to the polarization of the incident laser beam .",
    "as described in section  [ sec : crosssection ] , the direct measurement of @xmath49 agrees with the calculation within @xmath71% in the shorter and in the longer wavelength ranges around 337.1  nm . using crays , we measured the argon - to - nitrogen ratio at @xmath6 = 337.1  nm and showed that the calculation and the measurement of the ratio agree also within 1% ( section  [ sec : performance ] ) .",
    "this measurement gives an additional support that our calculation of @xmath49 is valid at the wavelength of 337.1  nm : no unexpected phenomena ( as resonant absorptions ) happened to the nitrogen laser photons in nitrogen gas .",
    "the differential cross - section , @xmath95 , for diatomic molecules such as n@xmath12 is modified by a small amount from the equation  ( [ eq : dsdth ] ) , which we used for estimating the number of rayleigh - scattered photons entering the pmt ( section  [ photonacc ] ) .",
    "this modification factor at @xmath83 is @xmath96 , or 1.011 using @xmath97 for the depolarization ratio of n@xmath12 gas induced by the incident light of wavelength 337.1  nm .",
    "for monoatomic molecules such as argon , the depolarization ratio is zero and @xmath95 is calculated by equation  ( [ eq : dsdth ] ) . for nitrogen gas , we observed the depolarization effect in the crays setup as described in section  [ sec : performance ] .",
    "we assign a systematic uncertainty of + 1.1% for @xmath95 .",
    "we observed an elliptical polarization of 4% for the incident laser beam with its polarization axis pointing @xmath98 away from the vertical - upward direction ( section  [ sec : performance ] , figure  [ fig : polarization ] ) .",
    "rayleigh scattering of linearly polarized ( 100% ) laser beam at @xmath15 = 90@xmath4 modifies the cross - section by a factor of @xmath99 , where @xmath27 is the rotation angle of the scattered photon measured from the direction of the polarization @xcite .",
    "the @xmath27 is 53@xmath4 for the crays setup whereas @xmath100 corresponds to zero correction on the cross - section .",
    "the observed polarization of 4% gives a correction factor of @xmath101 on the cross - section , corresponding to @xmath102 .",
    "we assign a systematic uncertainty of 1.4% for the polarization effect .    in summary , for the systematic uncertainty of rayleigh scattering cross - section , we have @xmath103 from @xmath49 , @xmath95 and the polarization .",
    "we evaluate a total systematic uncertainty of 2.8% , taking a quadratic sum for two @xmath21 uncertainties and adding + 1.1% uncertainty linearly .",
    "the molecular density of the scatterer gas is calculated from the temperature ( t ) and the pressure ( p ) of the gas inside the crays chamber .",
    "we evaluate an error of 1.3% for the molecular density calculation , consisting of the absolute calibration of the mercury barometer ( 0.5% ) , the stability of the pressure gauge calibration ( 1.0% ) , and the difference of the room temperature and the gas temperature in the scattering chamber ( maximum 2@xmath4c corresponding to 0.7% ) .    the largest contribution to",
    "the systematic uncertainty comes from the absolute calibration of the energy probe @xcite .",
    "the manufacturer calibrated the probes with an absolute accuracy of 5% using nist traceable standards .",
    "we used two rjp-465 probes and the results were well within the quoted accuracy .",
    "the second largest contribution comes from the acceptance calculation , which is dominated by the measurement accuracy of the slit size ( 38.9@xmath210.5  mm ) and the distance from the laser beam line to the pmt mask ( 312@xmath213  mm ) including the inaccuracy of the laser beam position in the scattering chamber .",
    "we estimated a total uncertainty of the acceptance to be 3.0% .",
    "the uncertainty of @xmath47 is estimated as 2.0 % from the signal integration and 1.9 % from the background noise contribution .",
    "the uncertainty of signal integration ( 2% ) is determined from the change of @xmath47 by using a different method of estimating the pedestal level , and by using different signal integration intervals .",
    "the uncertainty of background and noise subtraction ( 1.9% ) is taken from the remaining @xmath47 for the zero chamber pressure run .",
    "it is a conservative estimate because the amount of the background was stable throughout the calibration , and its contribution was actually subtracted in the data analysis .",
    "an uncertainty of 1.0% was estimated for the geomagnetic effect from the change of @xmath47 for the yap run taken in different azimuthal orientations .",
