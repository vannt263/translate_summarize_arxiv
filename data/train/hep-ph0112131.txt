    "two pion decay of radially excited heavy quarkonium ( @xmath6 ) states empirically constitutes a significant fraction of their total decay widths  @xcite .",
    "indeed , in the case of the @xmath7 ( or @xmath8 ) , the branching ratio of the @xmath0 decay mode is empirically as large as @xmath9 .",
    "consequently , there has been considerable theoretical interest in these decays as the coupling of two pions to heavy flavor mesons ( or quarks ) involves at least two gluons if not a glueball .",
    "a number of different theoretical approaches for the coupling of two - pions to heavy mesons have been proposed , ranging e.g. from effective field theory descriptions  @xcite and directly qcd - motivated models  @xcite to phenomenological models  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a lagrangian motivated by chiral perturbation theory has been fitted to experiment .",
    "the current empirical data on the @xmath0 decay of the @xmath7 and the analogous @xmath10 ( or @xmath11 ) state , along with a review of the relevant literature on the subject is given in ref .",
    ".    theoretical work on the @xmath0 decays of excited heavy quarkonia has demonstrated that the empirical energy spectra of the emitted two - pion system demands that the pions be derivatively coupled to the heavy quarkonium states .",
    "this is consistent with the role of the pions as goldstone bosons of the spontaneously broken approximate chiral symmetry of qcd .",
    "most models  @xcite have dealt with the coupling of two - pions to the heavy meson as a whole rather than to its constituent quarks .",
    "the satisfactory description obtained suggests that the decay amplitude @xmath12 at the quark level should be a smoothly varying , almost constant , function of the two - pion momentum @xmath13 , which is dominated by single - quark mechanisms for two - pion emission .    at the quark level , this is , however , not _ a priori _ expected to be the case . in the non - relativistic approximation , the amplitude for @xmath0 decay of excited @xmath14-wave states to the ground state through single - quark mechanisms is small because of the orthogonality of the quarkonium wave functions for different states .",
    "in this approximation the hadronic matrix element does not lead to a constant decay amplitude , but to one that increases quadratically with the two - pion momentum @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore , the pion rescattering or pion exchange term that appears naturally as a consequence of the coupling of two - pions to constituent quarks is in contrast not suppressed by the orthogonality of the wave functions , and may actually be shown to be dominant even in the relativistic case .    it is shown here that an unrealistically large pion exchange contribution may be avoided if the @xmath1 vertex involves an intermediate , fairly light and broad @xmath2 meson , in line with the phenomenological resonance model of ref .",
    "an intermediate @xmath2 meson leads to a drastic reduction of the contributions from pion exchange mechanisms , while single quark amplitudes are but slightly affected .",
    "this can be understood qualitatively as a consequence of the exchanged pion being off shell .",
    "the relativistic treatment of the quark spinors is shown to lead to a significant strengthening of the single quark amplitudes relative to those of pion exchange , and also reproduces the expected smooth behavior of the decay amplitude .",
    "the wave functions of the heavy quarkonium states are here obtained as solutions to the covariant blankenbecler - sugar ( bslt ) equation  @xcite with an interaction hamiltonian , which consists of the scalar linear confining + screened one - gluon exchange ( oge ) model of ref .",
    "@xcite and the instanton model employed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a fairly satisfactory description of the empirical @xmath0 decay rates and spectra for the transitions @xmath16 and @xmath17 is achieved when the pion rescattering contribution is   the decay @xmath18 remains something of a puzzle , as the spectrum of the two - pion for this transition indicates a dominance of the rescattering contribution .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section 2 describes the interaction hamiltonian of the @xmath6 system as employed with the bslt equation and the resulting spectra and wave functions of the @xmath6 states .",
    "section 3 contains the calculation of the @xmath0 width and the derivation of the decay amplitude @xmath12 and the hadronic matrix elements . in section 4",
    "the results for the @xmath0 decays of the @xmath7 and @xmath10 states are presented .",
    "section 5 contains a discussion of the obtained results for the @xmath0 decays of these states along with remarks on the implications of this model for the @xmath0 decays of the @xmath5 state .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian used in this paper in conjunction with the covariant blankenbecler - sugar ( bslt ) equation to obtain spectra and wave functions for the charmonium ( @xmath19 ) and bottomonium ( @xmath20 ) states may be expressed as @xmath21 where the different parts denote the confining interaction , one - gluon exchange ( oge ) and instanton induced interactions respectively . in view of the indications given by the radiative m1 transitions in heavy quarkonia  @xcite as well as the m1  @xcite and pion",
    "@xcite decays of the heavy - light mesons , the confining interaction is here taken to couple as a lorentz scalar . the oge interaction motivated by perturbative qcd has vector coupling structure . in the nonrelativistic approximation",
    "the interaction potentials in the hamiltonian  ( [ ham ] ) may be expressed in the form : @xmath22 for the scalar confining interaction , where the constant @xmath23 is known  @xcite to be of the order @xmath24 gev / fm . the second term in eq .",
    "( [ statconf ] ) represents the spin - orbit component of the confining interaction .",
    "note that the antisymmetric spin - orbit interaction will be omitted throughout since it vanishes in the case of equal quark and antiquark masses .",
    "similarly , the oge interaction may be expressed as  @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the running coupling constant of perturbative qcd , @xmath27 is the usual tensor operator @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , @xmath30 denote the heavy quark and antiquark masses , respectively .    the instanton induced interaction in systems with heavy quarks has been considered in refs .",
    "@xcite and consists of a spin - independent as well as a @xmath31 spin - spin interaction term .",
    "however , it was also found that only the spin - independent term contributes significantly for systems composed of two heavy quarks .",
    "thus the instanton contribution to eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) may be expressed as  @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the mass shift of the heavy constituent quark due to the instanton induced interaction . for a charm quark ,",
    "this is expected to be of the order of @xmath34 mev  @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath35 represents the instanton density , which is typically assigned values around @xmath36 .",
    "the covariant blankenbecler - sugar equation for a quark - antiquark system may be expressed as an eigenvalue equation similar to the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation : @xmath37 here @xmath38 denotes the reduced mass of the quark - antiquark system , while the eigenvalue @xmath39 is related to the energy @xmath40 of the @xmath6 state as @xmath41 \\left [ e^2 - ( m_q - m_{\\bar q})^2 \\right ] } { 8\\mu e^2}. \\label{ebslt}\\ ] ] for equal quark and antiquark masses , this expression simplifies to @xmath42 . the relation between the interaction operator @xmath43 , which in general is nonlocal , to the @xmath6 irreducible quasipotential @xmath44 is ( in momentum space ) @xmath45 where the function @xmath46 is defined as @xmath47 with @xmath48 . in the born approximation the quasipotential @xmath44 is set equal to the @xmath6 invariant scattering amplitude @xmath49 , and thus a constructive relation to field theory obtains .",
    "comparison of the bslt equation to the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation reveals that the quadratic mass operator employed by the former  ( [ ebslt ] ) leads to an effective weakening of the repulsive kinetic energy operator .",
    "also , wavefunctions that are solutions to eq .",
    "( [ diffeq ] ) , allow retention of the conventional quantum mechanical operator structure . for systems that contain charm quarks the static interaction hamiltonian described above has but qualitative value , because of the slow convergence of the asymptotic expansion in @xmath50  @xcite . therefore the potentials in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) should be replaced with versions , which take into account both the modification  ( [ vbslt ] ) and the relativistic effects associated with the lorentz structure of the interaction , as well as the effects of the running coupling @xmath51 .",
    "if the nonlocal effects of quadratic and higher order in @xmath52 are dropped , this may be achieved by replacing the main term of the oge interaction by  @xcite @xmath53 where the factors @xmath54 and @xmath55 are defined as @xmath56 for the running qcd coupling @xmath57 , the parameterization of ref .",

    "@xmath59 and @xmath60 are parameters that determine the high- and low - momentum transfer behavior of @xmath26 respectively , which will be determined by a fit to the experimental heavy quarkonium spectra . with exception of the effects of the running coupling @xmath26 , which lead to a strengthening of the long - range part of the oge interaction , the relativistic modifications in eq .",
    "( [ ogepot ] ) lead to a strong suppression of the short - range coulombic potential .",
    "these relativistic modifications are however significant only for distances @xmath61 fm . in principle , a relativistic form for the linear scalar confining interaction analogous to eq .",

    "[ expdat ] and  [ expdat2 ] indicate that a more favorable description of the @xmath0 invariant mass distributions may be obtained if the coupling constant @xmath70 is taken to be negative .",
    "this appears to be in line with the fact that the experimental distributions for @xmath20 and @xmath19 as shown in figs .",
    "[ expdat ] and  [ expdat2 ] show slight differences . in particular",
    ", the peak at high @xmath71 is somewhat lower for @xmath20 , while the tail at low @xmath71 is broader for @xmath20 .",
    "it has also been noted in ref .",
    "@xcite that the resonance model of ref .",
    "@xcite can not be simultaneously fitted to both the @xmath20 and @xmath19 data .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "[ expdat ] that if negative values of @xmath70 are employed then the abovementioned qualitative differences between the @xmath20 and @xmath19 decay distributions may be accounted for .",
    "the obtained value for the @xmath2 meson mass , 450 mev , is constrained even if single quark diagrams only are considered . in that case , a higher @xmath2 mass would lead to a distribution which is peaked too far to the right .",
    "if pion exchange amplitudes are considered as well , a higher @xmath2 mass leads to unrealistically large pion exchange contributions .",
    "the results are not very sensitive to the @xmath2 width , but standard values of @xmath72 mev appear to be favored by the calculations .",
    "it is also evident from fig .",
    "[ expdat ] that the pion exchange contribution , while having an overall favorable effect , appears to be somewhat overpredicted , particularly for @xmath20 .",
    "this problem can be traced to the nonrelativistic treatment of the pion exchange contribution , and can be alleviated if relativistic matrix elements are employed according to eq .",
    "( [ relexchmat ] ) .",
    "this relativistic weakening of the pion exchange amplitudes may also remedy the apparent underprediction of the @xmath73 width as given by table  [ restab ] .",
    "for @xmath19 the results are much less sensitive to the exact strength and form of the pion exchange amplitude , an effect which is due to the much broader radial wavefunctions of the @xmath19 states . in case of the decay @xmath74",
    ", it may actually be desirable to employ a @xmath75 larger value of @xmath70 , as indicated e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as expected , the logarithmic plot of the pion exchange amplitudes in fig .",
    "[ exchfig ] reveals that if point couplings between heavy constituent quarks and two - pions are employed , then pion exchange will be the dominant mechanism for @xmath0 decay of the heavy quarkonium states .",
    "[ exchfig ] also shows that for the values of @xmath76 obtained by fitting the model to experimental data , the pion exchange amplitudes are subdominant and constitute a relatively small correction .",
    "however , the contribution from pion exchange may still not be neglected . by comparing figs .",
    "[ expdat ] and  [ expdat2 ] , it is revealed that negative values of @xmath70 allow for better agreement with experiment .",
    "[ 1qfig ] illustrates the fact that , even though the charm and bottom constituent quarks are heavy , the nonrelativistic limit is not applicable for the single quark diagrams .",
    "this comes about because of the orthogonality of the wavefunctions in the matrix element  ( [ nrmat ] ) .",
    "it follows that the single quark mechanisms are highly suppressed since the product @xmath77 is always small for the observables considered here . if the spinor factors of eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) in the relativistic matrix element  ( [ relmat ] ) are taken into account , they will lead to an increase of the contributions from single quark diagrams . the resulting amplitude",
    "then becomes almost constant over the whole range of two - pion momenta covered by the @xmath78 decays , allowing agreement with the phenomenological deductions of earlier work  @xcite .",
    "also , since the relativistic modifications increase the effect of the single quark amplitudes by a factor @xmath79 , they also allow avoidance of large values of the coupling constant @xmath70 .",
    "this is even more important since otherwise , even though the pion exchange contributions are very much suppressed by inclusion of the @xmath2 meson , they may still overwhelm the single quark contributions in the nonrelativistic limit , making it very difficult to obtain agreement with the experimental @xmath0 energy distributions .",
    "it is worth noting in this context that the nonrelativistic approximation becomes realistic only if the constituent quark mass is larger than @xmath80 gev .",
    "another interesting point is to check whether the derivative coupling to pions in eq .",
    "( [ q2pi ] ) actually does provide a superior description of the @xmath0 energy spectrum .",
    "a comparison between a model with derivative couplings and one without them is given for the single quark amplitudes in fig .",
    "[ noder ] .",
    "as the inclusion of the @xmath2 mesons leads to the same conclusions of the vanishing of the pion exchange contributions for both models , a fair comparison may already be obtained by comparing the single quark amplitudes only .",
    "[ noder ] indicates that even in the relativistic case , a model without derivative couplings on the pion fields does not provide a good description of the @xmath0 distribution .",
    "such a model is seen to give a rather structureless distribution , which does not reproduce the sharp peak at large values of the scaled @xmath0 invariant mass @xmath71 and also gives a wrong curvature at low @xmath71 , a result which has also been obtained by ref .",
    "this is reassuring since the derivative couplings for pions are consistent with the role of pions as goldstone bosons of the spontaneously broken approximate chiral symmetry of qcd .",
    "the results of the previous section indicate that an overall satisfactory description of the decays @xmath81 and @xmath82 has been achieved .",
    "this good agreement was shown to depend on several factors , most notably the use of derivative couplings to pions , relativistic treatment of amplitudes where the two - pions are emitted from a single constituent quark , and the inclusion of an intermediate scalar @xmath2 meson with a mass of @xmath83 mev .",
    "inclusion of the @xmath2 meson has been shown to lead to a drastic reduction of the amplitudes , where one of the emitted pions is rescattered by the other constituent quark .",
    "still , there remains some issues with these transitions that deserve further discussion .",
    "as seen from table  [ restab ] , the decay widths for the @xmath19 system are generally underpredicted by @xmath84  % , if the coupling constant @xmath70 is determined from the corresponding decays in the @xmath20 system .",
    "there appears to be no obvious reason for this underprediction , as the results are not exceedingly sensitive to the particulars of the model used , nor to the exact values of the masses of the constituent quarks involved .",
    "furthermore , the pion exchange amplitudes are relatively insignificant for the @xmath19 system , and can not account for this underprediction .",
    "if the value of @xmath70 is increased by @xmath85  % for the @xmath19 system , the computed width for the transition @xmath86 comes into close agreement with the current experimental data .",
    "a similar requirement for a slight increase of the coupling constant for the @xmath19 system has also been noted by ref .",
    "@xcite , and is therefore likely to be a real effect .",
    "nevertheless , it has to be noted that the total width of the @xmath7  @xcite state is difficult to determine experimentally and still remains somewhat uncertain .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the agreement between the calculated and experimental @xmath0 energy distributions , as shown in fig .",
    "[ expdat ] , turns out to be somewhat better for @xmath19 than for @xmath20 .",
    "a likely explanation for this feature is the nonrelativistic treatment of the pion exchange amplitudes , eq .",
    "( [ 2q3 ] ) .",
    "this   in a slight overprediction of the pion exchange contribution , the effect of which is amplified by the narrowness of the @xmath20 wavefunctions .",
    "as the present model has only few degrees of freedom , and does not really constitute a `` fit '' to the available data ( e.g. the quark masses are fixed by the @xmath6 spectrum ) then lack of perfect agreement with experiment is not unexpected",
    ". a somewhat better fit to the available data on @xmath0 decay in the @xmath19 and @xmath20 systems has been obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite by employment of a more complex lagrangian with more adjustable coupling constants .",
    "another possible explanation is that eq .",
    "( [ sigmares ] ) may only be a very crude model for the interacting @xmath0 state .",
    "indeed , ref .",
    "@xcite has employed a somewhat more sophisticated @xmath2 model where the width of the resonance is not a constant .",
    "a further possibility is that two - quark contributions associated with intermediate negative energy quarks  ( see e.g. the `` z '' diagrams of ref .",
    "@xcite ) may significantly modify the calculated decay distributions and widths .",
    "these effects , which depend explicitly on the form and lorentz coupling structure of the quark - antiquark interaction arise from the elimination of negative energy components in the bslt quasipotential reduction , which has been employed in this work . for e.g.",
    "the scalar confining interaction and the coupling  ( [ q2pi ] ) they can be shown to be proportional to @xmath87 at the nonrelativistic limit and are therefore highly relativistic effects that , when treated properly , are expected to be of minor significance .",
    "an outstanding problem with the hadronic decays of heavy quarkonia has been the theoretical understanding of the @xmath88 and @xmath89 decays .",
    "these have been experimentally studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , and were found to have roughly equal widths of @xmath24 kev . this is a problematic feature since the derivative coupling of the pions in combination with the phase space factors naturally lead to a strong suppression of the latter decay mode relative to the former .",
    "this has led to the introduction of different coupling constants for the different decay modes in order to compensate for the increase or decrease in phase space . while this may be reasonable",
    "if the @xmath90 and @xmath91 states are treated as fundamental particles , it is difficult to formulate a consistent model using variable coupling constants if the @xmath0 decay is modeled in terms of a @xmath1 coupling . despite the generally good agreement with experiment obtained for",
    "the @xmath0 decays of the @xmath10 and @xmath7 states , a width of only 1 kev for @xmath92 can not be achieved with the present set of parameters .",
    "the @xmath0 energy distribution of the @xmath88 decay shows an anomalous double - peaked structure , which can not be explained by models dominated by single - quark amplitudes , such as the one employed above for the @xmath0 decays of the @xmath10 and @xmath7 states .",
    "this is in obvious contradiction with the conclusions from analysis of the @xmath0 energy distributions of the @xmath4 decays .",
    "in this situation it seems natural to assume that the initial @xmath5 state may have a more complex structure than a simple radial excitation of the @xmath93 .",
    "this has been investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite , where acceptable agreement with the experimentally observed @xmath0 energy distributions has been attained by consideration of intermediate @xmath94 states .",
    "however , the explicit calculation of coupled channel effects in ref .",
    "@xcite , indicates that the interpretation suggested by refs .",
    "@xcite may not be valid .",
    "however , the model of ref .",
    "@xcite also fails to reproduce the experimentally observed @xmath0 spectrum .",
    "the results obtained when the energy distribution for the decay @xmath95 is calculated with the same model as that employed for the @xmath96 decay are shown in fig .",
    "[ 3sfig ] .",
    "the width so obtained is large , 20.1 kev , mainly because the @xmath0 momentum @xmath97 may extend to over 800 mev , and the form of the distribution does not agree with the experimentally determined double - peaked structure .",
    "however , if only single quark diagrams are considered , the calculated distribution does appear quite similar to that obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath0 final state interactions have been taken into account . in that case",
    "the width is obtained here as 25.1 kev .    however , it is interesting to see what may be learned by using models of the present type to fit the observed double - peaked structure of the @xmath95 energy spectrum . in this case",
    "there are three parameters ( @xmath70 ,  @xmath76 and  @xmath98 ) that may be used as free parameters .",
    "it turns out , that the present model does in fact have sufficient freedom to accommodate a double - peaked @xmath0 energy distribution , as may be seen from fig .",
    "[ 3sfig ] . an optimal description of the @xmath0 distribution is obtained for the parameter values @xmath76 = 1400  mev , @xmath98 = 100 mev , @xmath99 , and gives @xmath100 = 1.07 kev . since the employed scalar",
    "meson is now much heavier , the contributions from the pion exchange and single quark amplitudes are of equal magnitude , which makes it possible to obtain a double - peaked spectrum .",
    "this scalar meson mass falls within the range of the empirical scalar resonances @xmath101(1370 ) with mass 1200 - 1500 mev and a width of 200 - 500 mev , and @xmath101(1500 ) with mass @xmath102 mev and a width of @xmath103 mev  @xcite .",
    "both of these states have , analogously to the @xmath2 , a strong coupling to @xmath0 . as a relativistic treatment of the pion",
    "exchange amplitudes will weaken their contribution slightly , the @xmath101(1500 ) appears to be favored by this phenomenological analysis .",
    "since most parts of the present model are concerned with the @xmath104 coupling , an explanation for the apparent absence of an intermediate @xmath2 meson in case of the decay @xmath95 may possibly be found in the ( nonperturbative ) hadronization of the gluon pair emitted by the heavy constituent quark .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that the @xmath0 energy distribution for the decay @xmath105 is not of decisive importance since the maximum value of @xmath97 is only @xmath106 mev for that decay mode .",
    "this implies that the shape of the decay distribution is mostly determined by phase space alone , and can not be used to discriminate between different theoretical models .",
    "the experimental data obtained by ref .  @xcite is also rather crude for that decay . if the parameters given in table  [ restab ] are employed , the @xmath0 width for the transition @xmath105 comes to @xmath107 kev , which is much smaller than the empirically determined @xmath108 kev .",
    "this fact was also noted by ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was found that a much larger coupling constant had to be employed .",
    "the shape of the @xmath0 distribution is however very insensitive to the @xmath2 parameters , and can be fitted with almost any values .",
