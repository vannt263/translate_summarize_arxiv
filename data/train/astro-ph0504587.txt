    "blazars , as a subset of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , are characterized by rapid and strong variability in multi - wavebands .",
    "this behaviour gives us much important information on their central physics .",
    "variability studies of blazars have been essential in understanding their inner structures , radiation mechanism , and other physical processes .",
    "pks  1510@xmath0089 has been the target of many monitoring programs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is a flat - spectrum radio quasar at redshift 0.361 and has a parsec - scale jet within just 3@xmath2 to our line of sight according to @xcite .",
    "a pronounced uv - excess , a very flat x - ray spectrum , and a steep gamma - ray spectrum are found in this object .",
    "its light curve is quite different from those of other blazars . besides fast and small amplitude variations and irregular outbursts , some brightness minima were also observed ( see * ? ? ? * and references there in ) . in particular ,",
    "three deep minima were reported by @xcite , @xcite with variations of 0.65  mag/41  min on 1999 june 14 , 2.00  mag/41  min on 2000 may 29 , and 0.85  mag/44  min on 2001 april 16 , respectively .",
    "these minima have nearly the same time - scales ( @xmath1 min ) and intervals ( @xmath3 d ) , and based on which , @xcite argued that the minimum was a periodic phenomenon and proposed that there was a binary black hole ( bbh ) system in the centre of pks  1510@xmath0089 .",
    "the minimum occurs when the primary black hole ( pbh ) is eclipsed by the secondary black hole ( sbh ) .",
    "they also predicted that a new minimum would occur in 2002 march , and they confirmed it with new observations @xcite .",
    "however , the time - scale of the new minimum reported by @xcite is 89 min , which is more than two times of the time - scales of the three previous minima .",
    "in fact , the authors had no observation for about 55 min before the minimum point ( see figs .  8 and 9 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , making their recorded fading phase ( 73 min ) much longer than the brightening phase ( 16 min ) .",
    "this highly asymmetric light curve would be rejected by an eclipsing model of a binary system .",
    "we also monitored this object from 2002 february to april . in combination with the data in @xcite , we provided new constraints on the optical variations of pks  1510@xmath0089 in this period .",
    "2 describes our observation and data reduction procedures .",
    "the results are presented in sect .",
    "4 discusses the evidence for bbh from periodic light curves and wiggling jets and sect .  5 gives a summary .",
    "our optical observation was performed on a 60/90 cm schmidt telescope located at the xinglong station of the national astronomical observatories of china ( naoc ) .",
    "a ford aerospace @xmath4 ccd camera is mounted at its main focus .",
    "the ccd has a pixel size of 15 @xmath5 and a field of view of @xmath6 , resulting in a resolution of 17 pixel@xmath7 .",
    "the telescope is equipped with a 15 color intermediate - band photometric system , which covers a wavelength range from 3000 to 10000  .",
    "the telescope and photometric system are mainly used to carry out the beijing - arizona - taiwan - connecticut ( batc ) survey and have shown their efficiency in detecting fast variability in blazars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our monitoring program covered the period from 2002 february 23 to april 10 .",
    "three or four photometric measurements were made in each night . however , as a result of the weather condition , only 14 night s data are useful .",
    "we used the most sensitive @xmath8 filter of the batc photometric system , which has a central wavelength of 6711  and a passband of 497  , and which is close to the cousins @xmath9 band .",
    "an exposure time of @xmath10 s , depending on the weather and seeing conditions , was able to produce a ccd image with a good signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the observational parameters are summarized in table  [ t1 ] .",
    "[ f1 ] illustrates the finding chart of pks  1510@xmath0089 and the four comparison stars used by us .",
    "the four comparison stars were also used in other monitoring program ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and have the @xmath9 magnitudes of @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "089 and four comparison stars used by us .",
    "the image was taken with our schmidt telescope in the batc @xmath8 band on jd  2452344 with size @xmath15 ( cut from a @xmath16 image).,width=317 ]    two automatic procedures have been developed for the data reduction of the batc images .",
    "` pipeline i ' includes bias subtraction and flat - fielding of the ccd images , and ` pipeline ii ' measures the instrumental magnitudes of point sources in the batc images .",
    "the latter is based on stetson s standard procedure of daophot @xcite .",
    "the extinction coefficients and zero points of the instrumental magnitudes were obtained by observing the four @xcite standard stars and were used to calibrate the instrumental magnitudes into the batc ab magnitudes . for details of the data reduction procedures ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the light curves of pks  1510@xmath0089 were given in the @xmath9 band in @xcite .",
    "for comparison , we calibrated our @xmath8 magnitudes into the @xmath9 magnitudes , which was done by using the perfect linear relationship between the batc @xmath8 magnitude and the cousins @xmath9 magnitude found by @xcite , i.e. , @xmath17 .",
    "our light curves in the @xmath9 band were then obtained .",
    "the observational results are given in table  [ t1 ] with columns being the observational date and time ( ut ) , julian date , exposure time , and the @xmath9 magnitude and its error .",
    "the overall light curve in the @xmath9 band is plotted in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , in which data in @xcite are also plotted .",
    "the two data sets are basically consistent with each other , except that our amplitudes of variation within each night are much smaller than those of xie et al.s , which is possibly due to our much shorter monitoring durations within each night .",
    "089 in the @xmath9 band from 2002 feb 23 to apr 10.,width=317 ]    the predicted 2002 minimum occurred on march 8 ( jd  2452342 ) according to @xcite . the light curve in that night is given in fig .  [ f3 ] , which combines our and xie et al.s data .",
    "the upper panel illustrates the light curve of the target quasar while the lower panel shows the differential magnitude ( average set to 0.0 ) between the 2nd and 4th comparison stars . from fig .",
    "[ f3 ] we can see that our observations just filled the large gap of xie et al.s observations .",
    "after a short time of fading phase beginning at jd  2452342.329 , the source underwent a brief brightening phase , as observed by us but missed by xie et al .",
    "then its brightness in the @xmath9 band dropped from @xmath18 to @xmath19 mag within 19 min , and rose back to @xmath20 mag in 16 min .",
    "therefore , the actual time - scale of the minimum is 35 min , rather than 89 min reported by @xcite .",
    "the light curve of the minimum becomes basically symmetric , in contrary to xie et al.s result .",
    "089 in the @xmath9 band on 2002 mar 8 .",
    "the open circles and dotted line are data in @xcite while the filled circles and dashed line are our observations .",

    ", @xcite reported three minima with time - scales of 41 , 41 , and 44 min , respectively .",
    "@xcite argued that the minimum is a periodic phenomenon and there is a bbh system in the centre of pks  1510@xmath0089 .",
    "they used the measured time - scales to estimate the black hole masses . in this sense ,",
    "the new 35 min time - scale of the 2002 minimum , as constrained by a combination of our and @xcite data , is more consistent with the time - scales of the three previous minima than the 89 min time - scale measured by @xcite .",
    "moreover , the basically symmetric light curve is more reasonable for an eclipsing model .",
    "periodicities in light curves are often attributed to the presence of bbhs ( see a review by * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "a prominent example is the bl lac object oj  287 , which shows in the optical bands quite a strict period of 11.86 yr @xcite .",
    "most explanations of the periodicity are based on the assumption that there is a bbh system in the nucleus of oj  287 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the periodicity is linked to the orbital motion of the bbh system .    for pks  1510@xmath0089",
    ", the situation is much different .",
    "its light curves show periodic minima rather than periodic outbursts . the best model to explain the minima in such short time - scales is the eclipsing model , as described by @xcite .",
    "other possibilities can hardly result in minima with such short time - scales .",
    "in fact , the four minima with nearly the same time - scales and intervals and the basically symmetric light curves would argue strongly for an eclipsing model and a bbh system .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      evidence for bbh in pks  1510@xmath0089 comes also from radio observations .",
    "pks  1510@xmath0089 is a radio - loud source with high polarizations .",
    "early radio observations detected an arcsecond jet in this object @xcite and classified it as a source with a well - aligned jet @xcite .",
    "more recently , the more sensitive vlba and vlbi observations detected a miniarcsecond ( mas ) jet in the opposite direction of its arcsecond jet @xcite , and then the object shows perhaps the most highly misaligned jet ever observed @xcite .",
    "in order to connect the highly misaligned mas and arcsecond jets , @xcite argued that the jet in pks  1510@xmath0089 bends at a deprojected distance of @xmath21 kpc from the nucleus , near the probable boundary of the host galaxy .",
    "the bend occurs either by ram pressure from winds in the intracluster medium or by the density gradient in the transition to the intergalactic medium .",
    "in fact , the jet shows bends on all scales on the 1.7 and 5 ghz vlba maps , from mas to arcsecond . the smaller the scale , the more significant the bend .",
    "@xcite also noted that the jet ridge - line ` wiggles in the plane of the sky after the first 10 mas ' .",
    "similarly , the 15 ghz image of @xcite reveals a short jet extending to the north and then bending to the northwest within 2 mas of the core .",
    "furthermore , multi - epoch vlba observations have detected several components moving away from the nucleus with different speeds and position angles ( see fig .",
    "26 in * ? ? ?",
    "this pattern of ejection naturally leads to a wiggling or precessing inner jet .",
    "the wiggling or precessing jet can be best explained in terms of a bbh system .",
    "bbhs were first proposed to be in agns by @xcite and have since been frequently used to explain the observed curved or misaligned jets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "bbh systems are formed mainly via galaxy mergers . in most cases ,",
    "the sbh is in an orbit non - coplanar with the accretion disc of the pbh , inducing torques in the inner parts of the disc and resulting in precession of the disc and its jet .",
    "the earth is in the orbital plane of the sbh .",
    "when the sbh moves along the orbit , the inner part of the primary accretion disc will vibrate between positions d1 and d2 , and the jet will oscillate between j1 and j2 , resulting in a wiggling pattern .",
    "( the jet is not in the orbital plane and actually follows a highly eccentric precess when the sbh moves along its orbit .",
    "see text for details . )",
    "the angles are enlarged for clarity .",
    "the minimum occurs when the sbh moves to position b3.,width=302 ]    therefore , the vlba and vlbi observations of the distorted jets in pks  1510@xmath0089 provide another evidence for the presence of the bbh in its nucleus .",
    "however , the situation in pks  1510@xmath0089 is much different .",
    "its light curves show periodic minima rather than periodic outbursts .",
    "correspondingly , it is also different in the interpretation of the periodic minima , which is linked to the periodic eclipse of the pbh by the naked sbh according to @xcite . in their scenario , the orbit of the sbh passes our line of sight to the pbh",
    "this configuration represents an extreme case of bbh systems , for which a schema is given in fig .",
    "the circle represents the orbit of the sbh around the pbh , and the earth is in the orbital plane .",
    "the thick lines denote two extreme positions of the inner part of the primary accretion disc .",
    "when the sbh moves to position b1 , the inner part of the primary accretion disc tends to move to position d1 under the gravity of the sbh , and its jet is directed to j1 .",
    "when the sbh moves to position b2 , the inner part of the primary disc tends to move to position d2 under the gravity of the sbh , and its jet is directed to j2 .",
    "therefore , the sbh moves along the circle , makes the inner part of the primary disc vibrating between d1 and d2 and the jet oscillating between j1 and j2 .",
    "consequently , an apparently wiggling jet is formed .",
    "when the sbh moves to b3 , the point on our line of sight to the pbh , the pbh is eclipsed and a flux minimum occurs .",
    "the minimum is a periodic phenomenon , and the periodicity is caused by the orbital motion of the bbh system .    for simplicity , fig .",
    "[ f4 ] gives only a 2-d diagram .",
    "in the 3-d reality , the jet will have a small angle to the orbital plane of the sbh , and the primary accretion disc will be slightly tilted relative to the normal of the plane . when the sbh moves along its orbit , the jet and the primary accretion disc will follow a highly eccentric precess , with j1 and j2 being two extreme directions of the jet .",
    "the angles in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] are enlarged for clarity .",
    "the jet actually stays in roughly the same direction from the point of view of the observer with only a small wiggling in the plane of the sky . during the orbital motion of the bbh system",
    ", the sbh could eclipse the pbh but it does not pass through the jet , and the jet does not cross the line of sight when precessing .      it is interesting to notice that ( quasi-)helical jet and periodic light curve usually co - exist in blazars .",
    "oj  287 itself shows evidence for a helical jet in its 8.4 ghz vlbi map @xcite .",
    "other examples presenting both helical jets and periodic light curves include 3c  120 @xcite , 3c  345 @xcite , ao  0235 + 16 @xcite , bl lac @xcite , mrk  501 @xcite , pks  0735 + 17 @xcite , and these objects are most proposed to harbor a bbh system in their nuclei @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the periodicity in light curve and helicity in jet usually ` couple ' in blazars and are interpreted within the scenario of a bbh system .",
    "in fact , the ` coupling ' of the periodicity and helicity can be easily explained in that the periodicity in helical jets will result in periodicity in relativistic boosting in jets and hence the periodicity in brightness .",
    "similarly , the periodic minima and wiggling jet observed in pks  1510@xmath0089 can both be taken as evidence for a bbh system .",
    "the sbh orbits around the pbh and exerts tidal torques on its accretion disc , resulting in disc vibration and jet wiggling .",
    "the eclipse of the pbh by the sbh leads to the periodic flux minima .",
    "the blazar pks  1510@xmath0089 was monitored from 2002 february to april .",
    "based on a combination of our data and those of @xcite , we constrained a new time - scale of 35 min and a nearly symmetric light curve for the 2002 minimum reported by xie et al .",
    "the new results are more consistent with the three previous minima observed by @xcite , @xcite and are more reasonable for an eclipsing model of a bbh system suggested by @xcite .",
    "radio observations have revealed wiggling jets in pks  1510@xmath0089 and provided another evidence for the bbh system .",
    "the ` coupling ' of the periodicity in light curve and helicity in radio jet is discussed within the framework of bbh systems .",
