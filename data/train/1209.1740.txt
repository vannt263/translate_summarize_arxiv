    "let the us denote the empirical distribution as @xmath6 , where , @xmath7 note that the empiricals may be given in terms of histogram data as well , i.e. we can have data from disjoint partitions @xmath8 on the sample space , with uniform haar measure @xmath9 .",
    "in such a situation the empirical distribution is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the number of points in @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "assuming that the data is from some unknown density @xmath14 a natural component of exploratory data analysis is to estimate the function @xmath15 .",
    "any density estimator is a descriptor of the population distribution , and when it is known that the population distribution is absolutely continuous with respect to some standard invariant measure , the radon - nykodym derivative is the density .",
    "now , the major question is what is the central problem in using empirical distribution for density estimation ?",
    "note that @xmath16 is unbiased and @xmath17 goes to 0 as @xmath18 .",
    "however , in case we assume that @xmath5 has a derivative @xmath19 with respect to the haar measure @xmath9 on @xmath3 ( in the sense of the radon - nykodym derivative ) the empirical estimate does not work .",
    "for example , it is a known that in @xmath20 , @xmath21 does not work .",
    "there are few different approaches in practice which are majorly used , viz . , kernel density estimation , spline smoothing and orthogonal series .      kernel density estimation ( kde )",
    "is a non - parametric way to estimate the probability density function of a random variable .",
    "kernel density estimation is a fundamental data smoothing problem where inferences about the population are made , based on a finite data sample .",
    "the solution to the smoothing problem lies in the space of all continuously twice differentiable functions , with square integrable second derivative . for kde",
    "the reisz representation is essentially used .",
    "@xmath22 if @xmath23 for all bounded continuous functions @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath25 denote the family of bounded continuous functions for which the estimate is unbiased , @xmath26 being a smoothing parameter , i.e. @xmath27 @xmath28 satisfies for bounded continuous functions , @xmath29 now @xmath30 can be thought of as an approximation to the degenerate measure @xmath31 when @xmath26 is small .",

    "@xmath36 integrating with respect to @xmath37 , we get @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "based on this the optimal value of the bandwidth is derived as @xmath41 thus , the minimal mise can be shown to be @xmath42        the usual smoothing spline problem @xcite can be considered as a minimization problem .",
    "let @xmath43 be a sequence of observations , modelled by the relation @xmath44 .",
    "the smoothing spline estimate @xmath45 of the function @xmath46 is defined to be the minimizer @xcite ( over the class of twice differentiable functions ) of    @xmath47    note that    * @xmath48 is a smoothing parameter , controlling the trade - off between fidelity to the data and roughness of the function estimate . *",
    "the integral is evaluated over the range of the @xmath49 . * as @xmath50 ( no smoothing )",
    ", the smoothing spline converges to the interpolating spline . * as @xmath51 ( infinite smoothing )",
    ", the roughness penalty becomes paramount and the estimate converges to a linear least squares estimate .",
    "it is useful to think of fitting a smoothing spline in two steps :    * first , derive the values @xmath52 * from these values , derive @xmath53 for all @xmath37 .",
    "now , consider the second step first",
    ".    given the vector @xmath54 of fitted values , the sum - of - squares part of the spline criterion is fixed .",
    "it remains only to minimize @xmath55 , and the minimizer is a natural cubic spline that interpolates the points @xmath56 .",
    "this interpolating spline is a linear operator , and can be written in the form @xmath57 where @xmath58 are a set of spline basis functions . as a result , the roughness penalty has the form @xmath59 where the elements of a are @xmath60 .",
    "the basis functions , and hence the matrix a , depend on the configuration of the predictor variables @xmath49 , but not on the responses @xmath61 or @xmath62 .    now going back to the first step",
    ", the penalized sum - of - squares can be written as @xmath63 where @xmath64 .",
    "minimizing over @xmath62 gives @xmath65      it helps in approximations in a suitable hilbert space @xmath66 of functions containing smooth functions .",
    "however , since the original probability distribution is unknown , the choice of @xmath66 becomes arbitrary .",
    "different techniques are needed for different spaces , for eg . in sobolev space",

    "the smoothing here requires the multiplication of the empirical coefficients by a smoothing sequence @xmath72 such that @xmath73 .",
    "now @xmath74 with @xmath75 can be written as @xmath76 thus a natural estimate of @xmath74 is then @xmath77 now by the cauchy - schwarz inequality the right hand side is convergent in @xmath66 .",
    "hence the orthogonal series estimator of @xmath78 is extracted by applying uniqueness of inverse fourier transformation [ give refs ] to the coefficients @xmath79 i.e. @xmath80      the choice of the hilbert space is unknown .",
    "there are several different hilbert spaces and basis which can be used , such as the fourier basis , and wavelets based on unknown smoothness parameters and the choice of the thresholding sequence @xmath72 @xcite . due to the arbitrary - ness in the choice of hilbert space , the choice of @xmath72 , its efficiency and error estimate is user driven .    the orthogonal series estimate are also convolution estimates @xmath81 where @xmath82 .",
    "this holds by the convolution property of the fourier transformation .",
    "there is also an issue regarding the sample space itself .",
    "if @xmath3 does not have a nice topological group structure , ( for eg .",
    "manifolds in @xmath83 , etc ) , then the question of estimation of density is not well posed because we do not have a base measure with respect to which we can define the density . in such cases we look for a transformation @xmath84 which is a 1 - 1 measurable open mapping that maps @xmath3 into a locally compact topological group .",
    "since there exists a natural haar measure @xmath9 in the topological group , it makes sense to talk about density in this situation .",
    "note that @xmath84 must satisfy @xmath85 .",
    "if we denote the density in this space by @xmath86 , we can estimate all integrals of the form @xmath87 by @xmath88 such functions generate the @xmath4-field @xmath89 . if @xmath90 ( borel @xmath4-field ) , i.e. , if @xmath84 is a 1 - 1 isomorphic mapping , we can find all such integrals in this indirect fashion .",
    "the major reasons for concentrating on @xmath2 are the as follows    * trigonometric fouries basis are computationally very efficient , with tools such as the fast fourier transformations , etc * the bochner s theorem which states that , + every positive definite function @xmath91 is the fourier transform of a positive finite borel measure . + let @xmath92 be the family of complex valued functions on @xmath20 with finite support , i.e. @xmath93 for all but finitely many @xmath37 .",
    "the positive definite kernel @xmath94 induces a sesquilinear form on @xmath92 .",
    "this in turn results in a hilbert space @xmath95 whose typical element is an equivalence class @xmath96 $ ] . for a fixed @xmath97 in @xmath20 , the ",
    "shift operator \" @xmath98 defined by @xmath99 , for a representative of @xmath96 $ ] is unitary .",
    "in fact the map @xmath100 is a strongly continuous representation of the additive group @xmath20 . by stone s theorem",
    ", there exists a ( possibly unbounded ) self - adjoint operator @xmath101 such that @xmath102 this implies there exists a finite positive borel measure @xmath46 on @xmath20 where @xmath103 , [ e_0 ] \\rangle = \\int e^{-iat } d \\mu(x)$ ] , where @xmath104 is the element in @xmath92 defined by @xmath105 if @xmath106 and @xmath107 otherwise . because @xmath103 , [ e_0 ] \\rangle = k(-t,0 ) = q(t),$ ] the theorem holds .",
    "+ @xmath108 + the bochner s theorem gives a 1 - 1 correspondence between non - negative definite probability measure and non - negative definite sequences . * the technique of fourier spline . choosing the orthogonal sequence as @xmath109 satisfies other nice properties in terms of homomorphisms , error in approximations , etc . the choice of the penalty can also be easily be determined .",
    "the main criticism of using the fourier basis is the fact it fails to capture local features such as discontinuities and edges .",
    "a survey of the literature shows several works on the adaptation to unknown smoothness by methods such as wavelet shrinkage ( donoho and johnstone ( 1995 ) ) @xcite , aggregation of thresholded wavelet estimators ( chesneau and lecue ( 2009 ) ) @xcite .",
    "several other methods include , the cross - validation methods ( nason ( 1995 ) @xcite and jansen ( 2001 ) @xcite ) , the methods based on hypothesis tests ( abramovich , benjamini , donoho and johnstone ( 2006 ) @xcite ) , the lepski methods ( juditsky ( 1997 ) @xcite ) and the bayesian methods ( abramovich , sapatinas and silverman ( 1998 ) @xcite ) .",
    "edge preserving function estimation has also been studied in literature especially by map estimators,(see bouman and sauer ( 1992 ) @xcite ) .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    in this paper we develop a technique for estimation of densities on @xmath2 using fourier spline and address the issue of adapting non - smooth local features using a hybrid of frequency and spatial domain .",
    "few results on the kernel density estimation can be found in pelletier ( 2005 ) @xcite and taylor ( 2008 ) @xcite .",
    "the classical kernel density estimator was first proposed by fisher @xcite for data lying on the circle , in which he adapted linear data methods of silverman @xcite and used a quartic kernel function @xmath110 . however ,",
    "when using data on the circle , we can not use distance in euclidean space , so all differences @xmath111 should be replaced by considering the angle between two vectors : @xmath112    this may also be written as @xmath113 where @xmath114 is a unit vector .",
    "a more natural choice for the kernel function is therefore one of the commonly used circular probability densities , such as the wrapped normal distribution , or the von mises distribution .",
    "this leads to an alternative representation for the kernel density estimate @xcite @xmath115    in studying properties of kernel density estimates in euclidean space , it is common to take taylor series approximations to give an asymptotic form for the bias and variance .",
    "these can then be combined to give an asymptotically optimal choice for the smoothing parameter ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "for data lying on the @xmath116 - dimensional sphere @xmath117 @xcite described the asymptotic bias and variance of two classes of kernel estimators .",
    "this was done by the use of directional derivatives , thus making the results a close analogue of the taylor series methods used for data in euclidean space .",
    "however , the classical kernel density estimators does not give a good estimate in a general set - up , when data might follow mixture distribution of a continuous and discrete distribution with non intersecting support . in order to illustrate ,",
    "let us consider the following .",
    "suppose @xmath118 truncated on @xmath119 with probability @xmath120 and a discrete distribution with probability @xmath121 , where the discrete distribution takes the values @xmath122 and @xmath123 with equal probability .",
    "note that this discrete distribution can be viewed as outlying data .",
    "the mean squared error using the usual kernel density is estimated via simulation study .",
    "the simulations have been performed using different sample sizes and by taking @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "the percentage increase in the mise when compared to the case taking @xmath126 is shown is table 1 . the whole process is repeated @xmath127 times .",
    ".mean integrated square error of classical kernel estimate [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]         in figure 8 , the gray line depicts the estimate from the standard kde , while the black depicts the estimate from fourier spline . here",
    "too we have been able to almost perfectly detect support .",
    "the extreme regions which have no data , has been correctly identified .",
    "furthermore , few local features such as outliers has also been identified by the procedure at 2.09 . as seen from the figure ,",
    "our estimate is much more closer to the actual probability distribution than the standard kde .",
    "note that although we have got an estimate of our density function by solving the spline smoothing on circle , our solution is not the exact solution because , the solution of the spline smoothing problem must belong to the space of non - negative definite sequence . if our solution was indeed non - negative definite , then by bochner s theorem , the corresponding kernel would have been non - negative .",
    "but as seen from figure 4 in section 2 , this is not the case .",
    "thus , solving the spline problem on circles with the non - negative definite constraint is one of the open problems which should influence researchers to further work in this field .      in this article , we have estimated the local features using the exponential model , and then multiplied it with the corresponding function @xmath128 where @xmath129 , a partition of unity , created on the set of open covers using the function @xmath130 for different choices of @xmath4 .",
    "let us explain this in a bit more details .",
    "suppose , we have detected a local feature in @xmath131 ( using the same notation as before ) , then @xmath131 forms a unit of the open cover .",
    "the rest can be chosen so that they form an intersecting set . now ,",
    "suppose , @xmath132 is has its support in @xmath131 .",
    "so , in order to estimate the local feature , what we have done is we have first estimated the exponential model using the data in @xmath131 and then multiplied that with @xmath132 .",
    "the final estimates is done through proper normalisation .",
    "now instead of doing this , another way of estimating the local feature could be estimating the whole function @xmath133 , where @xmath134 a density from the chosen exponential family .",
    "that is , we can find the optimal values of @xmath135 by maximizing the likelihood given by    @xmath136    instead of maximising , @xmath137 this would give us another estimate and we could do a comparative study on these different methods to see which method gives the best estimate of the local features .",
    "in this article , we have developed a new methodology for estimating circular probability distributions , using spectral isomorphism to solve an equivalent spline smoothing problem on the circle .",
    "there has been already a lot of literature which aims at density estimation on the circle however most of them are based on kernel density estimation with different modifications .",
    "but , working on the problem with the knowledge of presence of local features has hardly been attempted . since during smoothing of the kernel density",
    "the local feature gets lost , it is very difficult to capture these using the conventional kernel density estimation .",
    "we develop the methodology based on the usual spline smoothing problem , which tries to solve the curve fitting problem . in our case , because of the form of the fourier coefficient on the circle , the minimisation problem for finding the density in the @xmath138 space , gets transformed to the spline smoothing problem on the circle .",
    "the solution to that problem , via bochner s theorem can be transformed to a kernel which has a square integrable second derivative .",
    "thus , the density can be obtained through the inverse fourier transformation .",
    "we have been able to solve the spline smoothing problem on the circle and also derive several results on the resultant density estimate .",
    "estimates for the bias and mse has been calculated .",
    "the optimal rate of the density has been proved to match the optimal rate in the standard kernel density estimation .",
    "finally our methodology has been compared with other standard methods as a comparative study .",
    "another major focus of this work has been in the detection and estimation of local features such that outliers , discontinuity and edges .",
    "the testing problem is different for the concerned local feature however , the overall multiple testing has been performed using a novel application of the holm s procedure as well as a novel technique of working with a multivariate @xmath19-value profile .    the support and outlier detection has been done by considering a @xmath139 model , while discontinuity and edge detection has been performed by considering an exponential family .",
    "the final overall estimate is obtained by considering a partition of unity of a special function .",
    "the local functions has been estimated through exponential model and the smooth function is through a weighted adaptation of the fourier spline methodology .",
    "lastly , we have applied our technique to a few artificial densities and to a real life data as well . in all situations ,",
    "this technique proved to be a much better estimate than the standard kernel density estimates .",
    "we also have a few open problems for further research , especially , the problem of solving the spline problem on circle , restricted to the non - negative definite solution . as well as the comparative study of the different techniques of estimating the local features .",
    "we are also focusing our attention to finding the estimate of the local functions in the fourier paradigm itself .",
    "a few details regarding this and the complete flowchart has been discussed in the appendix .",
    "suppose @xmath140 denotes the density of the distribution .",
    "let @xmath141 denote the measure on the space .",
    "correspondingly @xmath142 denotes the empirical cdf .",
    "note that by the riesz representation theorem , @xmath141 can be thought of as an operator working on @xmath140 such that @xmath143 let @xmath144 where @xmath145 for @xmath146 is a partition of the circle .",
    "note that @xmath147 .",
    "now for @xmath148 , @xmath149 is the local information of @xmath140 on @xmath131 .",
    "@xmath142 is a measure on @xmath150 .",
    "let the sample from @xmath131 be denoted by @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "thus @xmath153 maps @xmath151 to @xmath150 .",
    "as @xmath154 becomes larger the information becomes more and more local .",
    "denote the conditional empirical cdf on @xmath131 as @xmath157 . now consider the @xmath158-th fourier coefficient , i.e , @xmath159 thus , @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the scattered empirical fourier coefficients which capture the localisation property at @xmath131 .",
    "thus for each element @xmath131 of the partition we have a localisation value as @xmath161 if @xmath162 and @xmath107 otherwise .",
    "we can consider this as the new data , as if we have only these @xmath158 data points , and we try to find the density value at these points . as mentioned before , we can see that because of equation ( 58 ) the localisation property is lost as the @xmath158-th fourier coefficient is calculated by a weighted average of these local information .",
    "thus , if we can use the information present in each @xmath131 to detect the presence of discontinuity or edges , through @xmath161 , and estimate the same , then the whole procedure can be generalized to the fourier paradigm .",
    "we are still trying to accomplish this and hope to succeed in the near future .",
