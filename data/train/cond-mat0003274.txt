    "since the discovery of cuprate superconductors , quantum spin systems have been studied to understand the magnetic properties of their undoped mother materials . in particular quantum spin systems with spin gap are interesting since the spin gap is possibly related to the superconducting gap in the doped case .",
    "although the materials are two - dimensional , it is basically important to study magnetic properties of spin gap systems in any dimensions .",
    "in one dimension , haldane @xcite predicted that the spin excitation spectrum of a uniform spin chain is gapless if the magnitude of a spin is a half - odd - integer , and is gapful if it is an integer . the prediction has been confirmed theoretically and experimentally in many standpoints .",
    "since haldane s prediction is based on a mapping of a spin hamiltonian to the nonlinear @xmath0 model ( nlsm ) , it is recognized that the nlsm is a useful tool to investigate spin systems .",
    "the nlsm has been developed for periodic inhomogeneous spin chains .",
    "affleck @xcite derived and examined an nlsm for a spin chain with bond alternation .",
    "the application of the nlsm to spin chains with more than one spin species in the period of more than two lattice spacings are also considered @xcite . in particular",
    "we have succeeded to derive an nlsm , with accurately keeping the degrees of freedom of the spin variables , for a general mixed spin chain with arbitrary finite period @xcite .",
    "we applied the nlsm method to systems with period 4 and spin species 2 ( we defines the magnitudes as @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) @xcite . imposing the condition that the ground state is singlet , only the possible order of spin magnitudes in a unit cell is of @xmath1-@xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath2 .",
    "we obtained phase diagrams in the parameter space of the exchange couplings . in a few special cases , numerical calculations",
    "have been performed @xcite .",
    "the phase diagrams obtained by the nlsm are qualitatively agree with the numerical results .    in this paper",
    "we examine another mixed spin chain with period 4 which includes three species of spins .",
    "the sequential order of magnitudes of spins in a unit cell is 1/2 , 1 , 3/2 and 1 .",
    "there are four kinds of nearest - neighbour exchange couplings among them .",
    "if we consider a simplified case , the exchange parameters on the both sides of a 1/2 spin are the same value @xmath3 , and those on the both sides of a 3/2 spin are of the same value @xmath4 .",
    "we in fact consider the distortion of @xmath4 on the both sides of a 3/2 spin .",
    "we map the spin hamiltonian describing the spin chain to an nlsm following ref .  @xcite . from the value of the topological angle in the nlsm ,",
    "we determine the phase diagram of this model in the space of the exchange parameters .",
    "the hamiltonian for the present spin chain is written as @xmath5 where the magnitudes of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are @xmath10 a unit cell is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_cell ] . to reduce the number of parameters , we restrict and reparametrize the antiferromagnetic exchange parameters as @xmath11 where @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) is the distortion parameter describing the asymmetry between the couplings of the both sides of a spin with magnitude 3/2 .        following ref .",
    "@xcite , we can map a general periodic mixed spin chain satisfying a restriction to the nlsm .",
    "the mapped nlsm action is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is an o(3 ) unit - vector field and @xmath16 is the lattice constant . for a general spin chain with period @xmath17 ,",
    "the constants in the action are given as follows : @xmath18 with accumulated spins @xmath19 the action ( [ action - nlsm ] ) is of the standard form of the nlsm : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the topological angle , @xmath22 is the coupling constant and @xmath23 is the spin wave velocity .    in the present model , the accumulated spins ( [ s_tilde_def ] ) are @xmath24 and then the constants ( [ j_n_def ] ) are calculated as @xmath25     as a function of @xmath26 for @xmath12 = 0.0 , 0.2 , 0.4 , 0.6 , 0.8 and 1.0 .",
