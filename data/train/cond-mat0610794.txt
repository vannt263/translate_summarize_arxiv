    "electronic , magnetic and superconducting properties of actinide elements recently attracted significant interest and attention in the condensed matter physics .",
    "most intriguing are the phenomena at the localization threshold of the @xmath1 series , which is crossed between pu and am , where the electron - electron correlations play a prominent role @xcite .    during last few years",
    ", electronic structure calculations of pu and am based on the conventional band theoretical methods ( the local density or generalized gradient expantion approximations lda / gga to the density functional theory ) could not explain essental experimental data . while , the lda / gga band structure calculations predict a local magnetic moment ( ordered or disordered ) to form on the pu @xcite and am @xcite atoms , none of them were seen in the experiment @xcite .",
    "also , the same papers attempted to evaluate the photoemission spectra ( pes ) and electronic specific heat in pu and am making use of single - particle lda / gga densities of states ( dos ) , incorrectly assuming weak electron correlation character of 5@xmath2 systems at the borderline between the localized , nonbonding , behaviour and the bonding situation of electronic bands .",
    "it was shown recently that the _ around - mean - field _ ( amf)-lsda+u correlated band theory gives non - magnetic ground state for pu @xcite and am @xcite .",
    "also , the equilibrium volumes and bulk moduli for @xmath0-pu and _ fcc-_am are calculated in a good agreement with experiment .",
    "however , there is a clear disagreement between the amf - lda+u calculated dos and pes , questioning the validity of this approximation .",
    "the dmft calculations @xcite using the ( amf)-lsda+u form of interacting hamiltonian demonstrated that experimental pes and high @xmath3 coefficient of the electronic specific heat in @xmath0-pu and its selected compounds @xcite originate from the excitations , and not from the ground state dos alone . while accounting for dynamical fluctuations , the dmft of ref .",
    "@xcite does not take into account atomic - like excitations which can play an important role in pu and am .    in this letter",
    ", we develop a dmft based computational scheme based on multi - orbital hubbard - i approximation ( hia ) @xcite including the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) which explicitly accounts for the atomic - like multiplet transition excitations in pu , am and their compounds . starting from the non - magnetic ground state calculated with the static mean - field amf - lsda+u approximation",
    ", we obtain excitation spectra of pu and am in surprisingly good agreement with pes , in support of the atomic - like origin of the electronic excitations in these materials .",
    "we start with the multi - band hubbard hamiltonian @xcite @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the one - particle hamiltonian found from ab initio electronic structure calculations for a periodic crystal .",
    "the indices @xmath6 label the lattice sites , @xmath7 denote the spinorbitals , and @xmath8 is the k - vector from the first brillouin zone .",
    "it is assumed that the electron - electron correlations between s , p , and d electrons are well described within the density functional theory , while the correlations between the f electrons have to be considered separately by introducing the interaction hamiltonian @xmath9 the @xmath10 is an effective on - site coulomb interaction @xcite expressed in terms of the slater integrals @xmath11 and the spherical harmonic @xmath12 . the corresponding one - particle green function @xmath13 is expressed via @xmath14 and the one - particle selfenergy @xmath15 which contains the electron - electron correlations , where @xmath16 is a ( complex ) energy with respect to the chemical potential @xmath17 .",
    "the interactions ( [ eq : hint ] ) act only in the subspace of f - states .",
    "consequently , the selfenergy @xmath15 is nonzero only in the subspace of the f - states . the simplest mean - field approximation ( often called l(s)da+u ) @xcite neglects the @xmath8- and energy - dependence of @xmath18 replacing it by the on - site potential @xmath19 . for a given set of spin - orbitals @xmath20",
    "the potential reads : @xmath21^{\\sigma}_{mm ' } = \\sum_{p , q,\\sigma ' } \\big ( \\langle m , p|v^{ee}|m',q \\rangle - \\langle m , p|v^{ee}|q , m ' \\rangle   \\delta_{\\sigma,\\sigma ' } \\big ) n^{\\sigma'}_{p , q } \\ , , \\label{eq:4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the local orbital occupation matrix of the orbitals @xmath20 .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the kohn - sham equation with the potential eq.([eq:4 ] ) can be obtained by making use of variational minimization of the lda+u total energy functional ( i.e. of the expectation value of the multiband hubbard hamiltonian ) in a way similar to the conventional density functional theory @xcite .    in what follows we use the local approximation for the selfenergy , i.e.",
    ", we assume that it is site - diagonal and therefore independent of @xmath8",
    ". then we can employ the  impurity \" method of ref .",
    "we first obtain a local green function integrating @xmath23 , eq.([eq:1gf ] ) , over the brillouin zone @xmath24 and define a  bath \" green function ( the so - called weiss field ) @xmath25 @xmath26 all @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath18 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gff ] , [ eq:6 ] ) are matrices in the subspace of the @xmath20 f - orbitals .",
    "the dmft self - consistency condition is now formulated by equating @xmath29 , eq.([eq : gff ] ) , to the green function @xmath30 of a single - impurity anderson model ( siam ) @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the effective hybridization function and @xmath33 is the siam self - energy .",
    "we write the eq.([eq:8 ] ) in the form of the eq.([eq:6 ] ) @xmath34 from which it follows that @xmath35 has the meaning of the siam  bath \" green function . the iterative procedure to solve the periodic lattice problem in the dmft approximation is now formulated in a usual way @xcite : starting with single particle hamiltonian @xmath36 and a guess for local @xmath18 , the local green function is calculated using the eq.([eq : gff ] ) and the  bath \" green function is calculated from eq.([eq:6 ] ) ; the siam is solved for this  bath \" and a new local @xmath18 is calculated from eq.([eq:8 ] ) , which is inserted back into eq.([eq : gff ] ) .",
    "the lda+u procedure can be viewed in the same way .",
    "there is no need to apply the full dmft iterative procedure described above and to solve the siam with the  bath \" from eq.([eq:6 ] ) . the self - energy @xmath37 is now approximated by a static potential @xmath19 from eq.([eq:4 ] ) , and the well - known relation between the green function , eq.([eq:6 ] ) , and the local orbital occupation matrix @xmath38 is used .",
    "in addition , the charge- and spin - densities needed to construct the single - particle hamiltonian @xmath39 in eq.([eq : gff ] ) are calculated self - consistently .",
    "we emphasize that lda+u approximation is generically connected with the lda+dmft procedure .",
    "here we attempt to build a computational scheme based on self - consistent static mean - field lda+u ground state that will allow us to access the correlated electron excitations .",
    "we specifically choose the _ around - mean - field _ version of lsda+u ( amf - lda+u ) which was shown to describe correctly the non - magnetic ground state properties of @xmath0-pu @xcite , fcc - am , pu - am alloys @xcite , and selected pu - compounds @xcite .",
    "we extend our previous works @xcite towards the dmft to account for the multiplet transitions which are necessary for a correct description of pe excitation spectra .",
    "we use the multiorbital hia which is suitable for incorporating the multiplet transitions in the electronic structure , as it is explicitly based on the exact diagonalization of an isolated atomic - like f - shell .",
    "further , we restrict our formulation to the paramagnetic phase , and we closely follow the procedure described in @xcite . we construct the atomic hamiltonian including the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) : @xmath40 and perform exact diagonalization of @xmath41 to obtain all possible eigenvalues @xmath42 and eigenvectors @xmath43 .",

    "we used lda+u eigenvalues and eigenfunctions calculated in the full - potential lapw basis @xcite to construct the on - site spin - orbital green function matrix , eq.([eq:14 ] ) .",
    "we evaluate the static  bath \" @xmath54 from eq.([eq:6 ] ) and find the hybridization function @xmath55 together with @xmath56 which determines the energy of  impurity \" level with respect to the solid potential : @xmath57 here we added the soc explicitly and assumed the paramagnetic case .",
    "we point on a difference in a physical meaning of @xmath58 in the original siam and in the auxiliary siam used in lda+dmft ( lda+u ) : in the former , it labels the position of the non - interacting f(d)-level so that the chemical potential is determined self - consistently for a given @xmath55 ; in the latter , the chemical potential @xmath17 is determined by a periodical crystal - basically by the green function of eq.([eq : gff ] ) - so that the auxiliary @xmath58 accommodates all the electrostatic shifts between correlated electrons and the potential of the solid .",
    "now we can formulate a simple approximate procedure to solve the dmft eqs.([eq : gff],[eq:6],[eq:8 ] ) with hubbard - i self - energy , eq.([eq:13 ] ) .",
    "we assume that the self - consistent static mean - field lda+u already gives a correct number of particles and hybridization . using the lda+u green function , eq.([eq:10 ] ) , and the potential , eq.([eq:4 ] ) , we evaluate the weiss field @xmath59",
    ". then we insert the hia self - energy , calculated for the same number of correlated electrons as given by lda+u , into this  bath \" , and calculate the new green function @xmath60^{-1 } + ( \\epsilon_{+u } - \\epsilon_{h } ) - \\sigma_{h}(z ) \\big)^{-1 } \\ , , \\label{eq:16}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is chosen so as to ensure that @xmath62 $ ] is equal to a given number of correlated electrons @xcite .",
    "starting from self - consistent amf - lsda+u ground state solutions for @xmath63-pu @xcite , and _",
    "fcc_-am @xcite , and making use of the corresponding eigenvalues and eigenfunctions we evaluate the @xmath64 green function given by eq.([eq:14 ] ) and the @xmath65  bath \" green function ( eq.([eq:15 ] ) ) @xcite . in hia calculations",
    "eq.([eq:10 ] - [ eq:13 ] ) we used the commonly accepted values of soc constants @xmath66 = 0.3 ev ( pu ) and 0.34 ev ( am ) . to find @xmath67 eq.([eq:11 ] ) , we choose the amf - lda+u values of @xmath68 , namely , @xmath69=6.0 for am and @xmath69=5.4 for pu @xcite .",
    "the self - energy eq.([eq:13 ] ) was calculated along the real axis for @xmath70 , where @xmath0 = 63 mev @xcite , and @xmath47 was varied from 100 to 1000 ev@xmath71 .",
    "we found no sizable effect due to the variation of @xmath47 for a given @xmath67 in the resulting spectral density eq.([eq:16 ] ) .    in fig.1a",
    "we show the f - projected dos ( fdos ) from amf - lda+u together with spectral density calculated from eq.([eq:16 ] ) . for _",
    "fcc_-am , the well localised fdos peak at -4 ev transforms to the multiplet of excited state transitions @xmath72 below the fermi energy , and fdos - manifold around + 2 ev to @xmath73 multiplet transitions . although there is no doubt that the 5f multiplets must dominate the experimental valence - band spectra of am - based systems , individual lines are not resolved ( except for partly resolved features in the spectrum of am metal ) , and the position of the 5f intensity in the energy spectrum is the main indicator of the agreement with calculations . in this sense ,",
    "the calculated am spectral density is in a good agreement with pes @xcite",
    ". it also agrees with similar calculations @xcite @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we performed the calculations of amn and amsb using the same @xmath74 set of values as for elemental am .",
    "the amf - lda+u yields amn as an indirect gap semiconductor and amsb as a semi - metal .",
    "the hia spectral densities for am @xmath2 manifolds in amn and amsb are shown in fig.1b , c and are in good agreement with pes experiments @xcite .",
    "experimental valence - band spectra of @xmath0-pu and several other pu systems exhibit three narrow features within 1 ev below @xmath75 , the most distinct one very close to @xmath75 being accompanied by a weaker feature at 0.5 ev and another one at 0.8 - 0.9 ev .",
    "their general occurrence and invariability of characteristic energies practically excludes any relation to individual features in density of electronic states .",
    "instead , a relation to final state multiplets has been suggested @xcite among other possible explanations .",
    "similar to am , the link to atomic multiplet is corroborated by the present calculations also for pu . for @xmath0-pu shown in fig.2a , the amf - lda+u fdos manifold at around -1 ev transforms into a set of multiplet transitions with high value of spectral density at @xmath75 .",
    "similarly to the pu metal , the pes exhibits the three most intense peaks for a broad class of pu compounds .",
    "the calculations performed for pute ( see fig .",
    "2b ) indeed demonstrate the three - peak pattern similar to pu , in agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "also we point out a good agreement between our calculations and recent dmft calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite , as well as those of svane for puse @xcite",
    ". one should note that the high spectral intensity at the fermi level is explaining enhanced values of the @xmath3-coefficient of electronic specific heat , observed in @xmath0-pu and other pu systems . as a conclusion",
    ", we have shown that the three narrow features observed in the valence band spectra of pu and majority of pu compounds can be identified with the most intense atomic excitations ( multiplets ) , calculated using the lda+u and the multi - orbital hia calculations .",
    "the calculations explain that the atomic excitations can be observed even if the 5f states are not fully localized as in @xmath0-pu , and the atomic character fixes the characteristic energies ( not intensities ) such that similar features are found in spectra of diverse pu systems . a reasonable agreement with experiment",
    "is found also for am and its compounds calculated on the same footing .",
