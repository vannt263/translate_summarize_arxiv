    "decades before grand unified theories were considered , dirac @xcite realized that the existence of monopoles implies charge quantization .",
    "it turns out that monopoles and guts are intrinsically connected , and monopoles can arise dynamically as topologically stable gauge field configurations from spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "their dynamics appear quite distinct from other kinds of objects in quantum field theory , and actions that incorporate monopoles into a theory with electric charges have to be either lorentz - violating @xcite or non - local @xcite .",
    "a magnetically charged condensate leads to a magnetic dual meissner effect and represents one possible explanation for confinement @xcite .",
    "( for an excellent review of these ideas the reader is directed to @xcite . )    in 1994 seiberg and witten @xcite were able to use elliptic curves to find the low - energy effective action of @xmath7 supersymmetric @xmath8 gauge theories .",
    "as the gauge symmetry is broken to @xmath9 we would expect to find heavy topological monopoles and dyons .",
    "they discovered that some of those topological states become massless weakly coupled particles at certain singular points on the moduli space , where the electric gauge coupling diverges .",
    "furthermore , softly breaking these theories to @xmath10 supersymmetry ( susy ) lifted the moduli space and induced the massless monopole to condense , leading to electric confinement and providing an illuminating perspective on the well - known @xmath10 phenomenon of gaugino condensation .",
    "( a pedagogical introduction can be found in @xcite . )",
    "these results were soon generalized to higher gauge groups @xcite .",
    "the higher - dimensional moduli spaces of these theories contain singular submanifolds where both electric and magnetic charges of the same @xmath9 gauge group become simultaneously massless , providing the first example of a self - consistent quantum field theory where this particle content arises dynamically .",
    "it is also possible to apply these methods to the analysis of minimally supersymmetric @xmath11 theories in the coulomb phase and extract the holomorphic parts of the low - energy effective action @xcite .",
    "susy is , of course , extremely interesting for phenomenological reasons , the most important one being the stabilization of the weak scale .",
    "while there are several possible mechanisms for breaking supersymmetry @xcite and mediating its breaking to the supersymmetric standard model , no clear favorite has emerged .",
    "it is therefore prudent to continue looking for new ways of breaking susy .",
    "the unique properties of monopoles , and the fact that they arise as light states dynamically and calculably in some theories , motivate the construction of susy - breaking models that rely on monopole dynamics .",
    "the hope is that eventually some new mechanisms with desirable , novel features might be found . in this paper",
    ", we initiate the study of such constructions .    models involving meta - stable susy - breaking @xcite circumvent the restrictive witten index constraint @xcite .",
    "the topic enjoyed a fresh surge of interest since intriligator , seiberg , and shih showed how theories as simple as sqcd in the free magnetic phase can feature metastable susy - breaking vacua @xcite , and since then many models have been proposed to incorporate these ideas into a phenomenologically viable model @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite also suggested that @xmath12 sym might plausibly feature such susy - breaking vacua , and their intuition turned out to be correct .",
    "deformed @xmath12 theories can generate susy - breaking local minima at generic points of their moduli spaces @xcite , but the metastable vacua do not lie on the singularity and the monopoles of the theory play no role .",
    "@xcite considers an @xmath12 model in the coulomb phase softly broken to @xmath10 which classically breaks susy in a metastable vacuum via a fayet - illiopoulos term .",
    "they find that the susy - breaking survives the nonperturbative quantum effects , and that light dyons undergo condensation at the meta - stable susy - breaking minimum .    here , we want to construct a dynamical model of supersymmetry - breaking where susy would be restored in the absence of a monopole condensate .",
    "our starting point will be the @xmath10 @xmath13 model @xcite , where the gauge symmetry is broken to @xmath9 on the moduli space and there are singular submanifolds on which monopoles or dyons become massless .",

    "there is one possible source of tuning in this model , which is the alignment of the deformations in the electric theory . if the coefficients of @xmath206 and @xmath111 in the linear combinations @xmath109 are not properly chosen in the electric superpotential eq .",
    "( [ e.model1wtree ] ) then they do not correspond to the canonical ir degrees of freedom @xmath69 and the effective ir superpotential will not exactly resemble eq .",
    "( [ e.model1deformations ] ) .",
    "we can get a feeling for the required level of alignment by considering the following more general superpotential , @xmath207 most of these misalignments are harmless , shifting tree - level vevs or inducing tree - level tadpoles for the pseudomodulus .",
    "however , some can destabilize the susy - breaking vacuum .    the @xmath208 term , apart from inducing a tree - level pseudomodulus tadpole like @xmath209 , shifts the effective @xmath91-coupling in the fermion contribution to @xmath94 . for @xmath210 , the maximum allowed values of @xmath208 that do not destroy the local minimum lie in the range @xmath211 depending on @xmath102 and @xmath54 , with @xmath212 decreasing for larger @xmath102 and smaller @xmath54 .",
    "this represents the required level of tuning in the @xmath213 linear combinations .",
    "the @xmath214 and @xmath215 terms give a mass to the pseudomodulus @xmath216 , where @xmath217 . adding a pseudomodulus mass to the shih - oraifeartaigh model creates a susy minimum at @xmath218 and tilts the pseudomoduli space away from the origin .",
    "we have to make sure that @xmath94 is not overwhelmed by this gradient , which at a position @xmath99 on the pseudomoduli space is given by @xmath219 translating this to our effective shih - oraifeartaigh model and using equations ( [ e.shihxvev ] ) , ( [ e.shihbarriergradient ] ) , we obtain the following upper bounds : @xmath220 where we have used the fact that for small @xmath91 , @xmath221 when @xmath85 .",
    "consider the explicit example of scales considered below equation eq .",
    "( [ e.model1constraints ] ) .",
    "@xmath115 is already a small number satisfying @xmath222 .",
    "the constraint eq .",
    "( [ e.epsilonytuning ] ) gives @xmath223 if we take @xmath224 , @xmath225 could be as big as @xmath226 for @xmath96 and unity for @xmath227 , representing the required level of tuning in the @xmath228 linear combination .",
    "in section [ s.model1 ] we constructed a theory of monopole - triggered susy - breaking based on the @xmath13 model .",
    "this method of deforming models with massless monopoles to induce susy - breaking seems fairly general , and it is instructive to try and embed the shih - model differently into the monopole sector .",
    "the first alternative possibility is to make @xmath161 composite instead of the pseudomodulus @xmath80 .",
    "starting from eq .",
    "( [ e.cefssuperpot1 ] ) , this would lead us to add the deformations and singlet fields @xmath229 these couplings preserve the @xmath58 global symmetry as long as @xmath160 and @xmath230 are also charged . the @xmath140 tadpole induces a monopole vev which generates a mass for @xmath43 , completing the shih - oraifeartaigh sector .",
    "the coupling @xmath231 comes from an operator that is higher dimensional than in the model of section [ s.model1 ] .",
    "the stability of @xmath80 against incalculable corrections as well as the existence of a susy - breaking minimum requires the hierarchy @xmath232 turning off the @xmath13 gauge interactions ( @xmath106 ) does not destroy the susy - breaking pseudomoduli space at tree - level , meaning the gauge interactions deform a classically existing susy - breaking minimum , similar to @xcite .",
    "since the goal of this paper is to find a model of dynamical monopole - triggered susy - breaking we will not pursue this possibility further .",
    "the ` most dynamical ' embedding of the shih - oraifeartaigh sector into the @xmath13 model is to make both the pseudomodulus @xmath80 and @xmath161 composite .",
    "since we are using ` more ' of the monopole sector to break susy this requires fewer deformations : @xmath233 again the @xmath140 tadpole induces a monopole vev , which now provides a tadpole for @xmath131 as well as a mass for @xmath43 , which act as the pseudomodulus and @xmath161 respectively .",
    "stability of @xmath80 against corrections and existence of the susy - breaking vacuum requires @xmath234 due to the smallness of @xmath235 : @xmath236 as desired , susy is restored in the @xmath106 limit .",
    "both of these models feature standard shih - oraifeartaigh runaways in the strong coupling case , with @xmath140 adjusting to keep the trajectory on the singularity .",
    "this latter model appears more elegant than the model of section [ s.model1 ] , but it suffers the unfortunate drawback that corrections render the @xmath43-mass incalculable , a result of the monopole vev doing double duty . while this also does not fulfill our requirements for a calculable monopole - triggered dynamical susy - breaking theory , these two alternative deformations of the @xmath13 model demonstrate how one might produce many more models of susy - breaking",
    "that include monopole dynamics .",
    "monopoles have many unique characteristics that make them very interesting",
    ". their unusual dynamics might hold the key to constructing novel models of supersymmetry ( or perhaps electroweak ) breaking .",
    "topological monopoles , traditionally treated as nonperturbative objects , can be calculationally controlled using seiberg - witten methods .",
    "this opens up new avenues for model building .    in our model ,",
    "supersymmetry breaking is triggered by monopole condensation .",
    "a suitably deformed @xmath13 theory with massless monopoles takes on the form of an effective shih - oraifeartaigh model with a meta - stable susy - breaking local minimum . in constructing such a model within the limitations of @xmath11 supersymmetry",
    "it is important to check that incalculable corrections do not destabilize the false vacuum .",
    "we have shown that these contributions can be controlled , and through appropriate choices of scales can be made subdominant .",
    "additional deformations of the @xmath13 model , with varying characteristics , demonstrate more generally how models with massless monopoles might be deformed to induce susy - breaking .",
    "it is our hope that this will open up new investigations which might eventually yield elegant mechanisms of breaking supersymmetry that circumvent some of the problems encountered by other approaches",
    ". it would be interesting to explore susy - breaking in theories that have both massless electrically and magnetically charged particles .",
