    "the cybele region , adjacent and exterior to the asteroid belt , is usually defined as the region in semi - major axis between the 2j:-1a and 5j:-3a mean - motion resonances with jupiter . an increase in the number density of three - body resonances at semi - major axis larger than 3.7 ( gallardo 2014 ) makes the region between the cybele area and the hilda asteroids dynamically unstable , making the cybele region the last outpost of an `` extended '' main belt , according to some authors ( carruba et al .",
    "binary asteroids in the region suggested the presence of asteroid families , but only relatively recently a new dynamical family was found near 87 sylvia ( vokrouhlick et al .",

    "we then obtain age estimates of the four families identified in this work , sylvia , huberta , ulla and helga , with the method of yarkovsky isolines and the monte carlo yarko - yorp approach of vokrouhlick et al .",

    "we confirm the presence of the new helga group ( vinogradova and shor 2014 ) that could extend the boundary of the cybele region up to the 5j:-3a mean - motion resonance , and the fact that the estimated age of the sylvia could be compatible with an origin just prior to the late heavy bombardment .",

    "[ sec : conc ] , we present our conclusions .",
    "we start our analysis by obtaining proper elements for asteroids in the cybele region ( defined as the region between the 2j:-1a and 5j:-3a mean - motion resonances with jupiter , i.e. , with an osculating semi - major axis between 3.28 and 3.70  au ) .",
    "we computed synthetic proper elements for the 1507 numbered and 433 multi - opposition asteroids in the region , whose osculating elements were downloaded from the astdys site ( http://hamilton.dm.unipi.it/astdys , kneevi and milani 2003 ) on october 29th 2014 , with the procedure discussed in carruba ( 2010b ) . of the 1940 particles , 1327 numbered asteroids and 317 multi - opposition survived for the length of the integration ( 10 myr ) .",
    "we also eliminated all objects for which one of the proper elements @xmath2 or proper frequencies",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 had errors larger than those classified as `` pathological '' by kneevi and milani ( 2003 ) ; i.e. , @xmath5  au , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "this left us with a data - set of 1225 numbered and 275 multi - opposition asteroids with proper elements in the orbital region , for a total of 1500 asteroids with good - quality proper elements .    a projection in the @xmath9 plane of the proper elements ( with their errors in proper @xmath10 ) for the surviving 1500 objects is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ai_da ] . objects classified as having unstable proper @xmath10 ( @xmath11  au ) are shown as yellow full dots .",
    "we then computed the location of two- and three - body mean - motion resonances with the approach of gallardo ( 2014 ) .",
    "this method allows to compute the value of the semi - major axis of the resonance center and to estimate the resonance strength through a parameter @xmath12 whose maximum value is one .",
    "the location of three - body resonances was estimated up to order 30 including planets from earth to uranus , and using the values of eccentricity , inclination and argument of pericenter of 87 sylvia , the asteroid with the largest family in the region .",
    "two - body resonances with @xmath12 up to @xmath13 and three - body mean - motion resonances with @xmath12 up to @xmath14 are shown as vertical red lines and blue lines , respectively ( for simplicity we only identify three - body resonances with @xmath15 .",
    "the thickness of the lines is associated with the resonance strength .",
    "linear secular resonances are displayed as blue lines , while the inclined red line display the approximate location of the center of the @xmath16 non - linear secular resonance ( see carruba ( 2010b ) for a description of the method used to plot the center of libration for secular resonances ) .",

    "2010 ) , known asteroid families tend to cluster in the regions with lower number density of resonances . if we define highly inclined asteroids as those with inclination higher than that of the center of the @xmath17 secular resonance , only one numbered asteroid satisfies this criteria : 1373 cincinnati , with an inclination of @xmath18 . generally speaking , the @xmath17 secular resonance forms the upper boundary in inclination of the cybele region , while the 2j:-1a and 4j:-7a mean - motion resonances with jupiter delimit the region in semi - major axis for most of the asteroids in the region , with the notable exception of the new ( 522 ) helga group , between the 4j:-7a and 5j:-3a mean - motion resonances , that could be the main belt family most distant from the sun ( vinogradova and shor 2014 ) , and is of particular interest because of the very peculiar dynamics of 522 helga , characterized by weak instabilities on extremely long timescales , the so - called `` stable chaos '' of milani and nobili ( 1992 , 1993 ) .",
    "asteroids in the cybele region do not generally experience planetary close encounters .",
    "the region is also crossed by a web of non - linear secular resonances , of which the most studied ( vokrouhlick et al .",
    "2010 ) is the @xmath19 secular resonance .",
    "we will further discuss secular dynamics in the region in the next section .",
    "secular resonances occur when there is a commensurability between the proper frequency of precession of the argument of pericenter @xmath3 or of the longitude of the node @xmath4 of a given asteroid and a planet .",
    "if the commensurability is just between one frequency of the asteroid and one frequency of the planet , such as in the case of the @xmath20 secular resonance , the resonance is linear .",
    "higher order resonances involving more complex combinations of asteroidal and planetary frequencies , such for instance the @xmath21 resonance , are called non - linear secular resonances . carruba ( 2009a )",
    "defines as likely resonators the asteroids whose frequency combination is to within @xmath22 arcsec / yr from the resonance center . for the case of the @xmath16 resonance",
    ", this means that @xmath23  arcsec / yr . about 90% of the @xmath16 likely resonators in the padua family area were found to be actual librators , when the resonant argument of the resonance was analyzed .",
    "we selected likely resonators for all non - linear secular resonances in the cybele region up to order six following the procedure described in carruba et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , and then verified that the appropriate resonant argument for each of these asteroids was in a librating state .",
    "[ fig : cybele_ggs ] displays a projection in the proper @xmath24 plane of asteroids in the region ( panel a ) , as well as a projection of asteroids found to be in librating states of non - linear secular resonances in the region ( panel b , only two - body resonances were reported in this plot for simplicity ) .",
    "our results are summarized in table  [ table : sec_res ] , where we display the name of the resonances with a population of asteroids larger than 1 , the value of the combination of planetary frequencies in the resonant argument , the number of likely resonators , and the number of asteroids actually found in librating states .",
    "no asteroids in the cybele region were found to be in or near linear secular resonances .",
    "the large number of likely resonators found for the @xmath25 resonance is in fact an artifact caused by the perturbation on the @xmath3 frequency value of objects near the separatrix of the 2j:-1a mean - motion resonance ( no asteroid was found to be in librating states of this resonance by our analysis ) .",
    "three @xmath26 resonances have the largest population of librators , the @xmath16 resonance with 22 asteroids ( most of which are found in or near the sylvia family ( vokrouhlick et al . 2010 ) ) , the @xmath27 ( six bodies ) , and the @xmath28 with five objects .",

    ", we estimated that the sylvia family may have been @xmath29 time more numerous at the time of its formation . at the end of the run 36.0% of the asteroids with @xmath30  km ,",
    "30.2% of those with @xmath31  km , and 18.5% of those with @xmath32  km were still in the sylvia family region , so suggesting that only the largest fragments of an hypothetical lhb sylvia family may still be visible today in the cybele region .",
    "of more interest were the results of the sylvia simulations starting 4200 myr ago .        in this longer simulation the sylvia family",
    "did not completely dispersed up to the end at 4.2 gyr .",
    "more importantly , 10.0% of the asteroids with @xmath30  km , 3.4% of those with @xmath31  km , 5.6% of those with @xmath32  km , and 0.8% of those with @xmath33  km could still be found at the end in the sylvia family region .",
    "these results our displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : count_dia ] , the horizontal black line shows the minimum number of objects to identify a cluster in the cybele region ( 8) , while the vertical black line shows the minimum estimated age for the end of the lhb ( 3.8 gyr ) .",
    "see the figure legend for the color code associated with the each given range in particles diameter .",
    "as found in the shorter sylvia simulation , we confirm that the largest fragments ( @xmath34  km ) of a post - lhb sylvia family could possibly remain in the cybele region since its formation .",
    "we identify 30 x - type objects in this area with @xmath35 and @xmath34  km , two of which , ( 149776 and 172973 ) , are current sylvia family members . since space weathering effects on x - type objects are not well understood ( nesvorn et al .",
    "2005 ) , the possibility that some of these asteroids predates the formation of the current sylvia family remain speculative and difficult to prove .",
    "but , it could be an interesting field of future research .",
    "finally , none of the simulated sylvia fragments reached the regions of the ulla and helga families during the 4.2 gyr simulations , which raises questions about the possible mechanisms that put the parent bodies of these groups in their current orbits .",
    "concerning the other integrated families , our results for the huberta family seems to confirm the age estimate obtained in sect .",
    "[ sec : chron_huberta ] : in both the 1100 and 3000 myr simulations the family dispersed in timescales comparable with the estimated age of the family , i.e. , 1100 myr . extrapolating the current loss rates to the past",
    ", we estimated that the huberta family may have been @xmath36 time more numerous at the time of its formation .",
    "the upper estimate of the age of 3000 myr would have required an initial population more than 10 times larger then the current one , which seems unlikely . concerning the families proposed by vokrouhlick et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , camilla and hermione , our results show that such families would have dispersed in timescales of the order of 1.5 gyr at most .",
    "should such families have formed before that time , they would no longer be recognizable , as suggested by these authors .",
    "since results in sect .  [",
    "sec : dyn_cybele ] suggested the possibility that some members of a pre - late heavy bombardment sylvia family may have survived to the present , here we investigated what would have happened to a hypothetical family formed before @xmath0 4.0  gyr when jupiter jumped in the jumping jupiter scenario of planetary migration of nesvorn et al .",
    "( 2013 ) . in this work",
    "the authors showed that the current orbital distribution of jupiter trojans may have occurred when jupiter s orbit and its lagrange points were displaced in a scattering event with an ice giant and felt into a region populated by planetesimal .",
    "of the three models for this jump capture , we choose to work with their case 1 , where five giant planets started in the 3:2 , 3:2 , 2:1 , and 3:2 resonant chain , since this scenario was the most favourable in reproducing the current orbital distribution of jupiter s trojans .",
    "to better understand the local dynamics before and after jupiter jumped , we obtained dynamical maps in the @xmath9 plane for the planetary configurations at the beginning and at the end of the 10 myr integration with the scenario of nesvorn et al .",
    "we integrated 4131 initially equally displaced particles in the @xmath9 plane , in a grid of 51 by 81 particles , with a step in @xmath10 of 0.01  au and of @xmath37 in @xmath38 , starting from 3.20  au and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "the eccentricity and the other angles of the test particles were the same of 87 sylvia at present .",
    "[ fig : map_jump ] displays our results for the two simulations .",
    "black dots represent synthetic proper elements computed with the approach described in sect .",
    "[ sec : prop_el ] , while red vertical lines identify the positions of the main mean - motion resonances at each epoch .",
    "mean - motion resonances appear as vertical strips deprived of particles , while secular resonances appears as inclined , low - density bands .",
    "since timescales for migration are quite fast in the jumping jupiter scenario , and of the order of the myr , we ignored secular dynamics in this analysis .",
    "one can notice that the current sylvia and huberta families lie on top of the 2j:-1a mean - motions at the beginning of the scenario , and would have been destabilized on timescales of less then a few myr . after jupiter jumped , the 2j:-1a mean - motion resonance would have migrated towards smaller semi - major axis , but a series of three - body resonances currently at higher semi - major axis then the center of the 5j:-3a would also have been displaced inwards , making the cybele region , and the sylvia family region in particular , rather unstable .",
    "these results suggest that the cybele asteroids should not be primordial , and must have reached their current orbits after jupiter jumped .",
    "to confirm the instabilities of asteroid families in the cybele region with the jumping jupiter scenario , we also integrated the same 1000 particles used for our simulation with the sysyce 4200 myr integration of the sylvia family discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : past_dyn ] , with the approach described in nesvorn et al .",

    "2 , over 10 myr . we choose to work with this timescales because this correspond to the period of planetary instability . in this scenario ,",
    "jupiter jumped at @xmath40 myr .",
    "[ fig : sylvia_jj ] displays an osculating @xmath9 projection of orbital elements of the integrated asteroids at the beginning ( panel a ) , and at t = 5 , 6 , and 10 myr of the simulation . since the particles osculating elements changed significantly over the length of the integration , we preferred not to compute proper elements in this case . of the 1000 particles",
    "that were simulated in this scenario , only 7 had orbits in the cybele orbital region at the end of our integration whose orbits were stable enough to allow the computation of synthetic proper element , i.e. , 0.7% of the initial population .",
    "overall , a pre - lhb sylvia family would have been almost completely dispersed , so confirming the results of other authors for the cybele region ( bro et al .",
    "interestingly , 5 particles temporarily reached the ulla family region during the length of the simulation , as defined in sect .",
    "[ sec : past_dyn ] . since minton and malhotra ( 2011 ) argued that the ulla region should have been depopulated by the effect of sweeping secular resonances , and since we showed in sect .",
    "[ sec : past_dyn ] that the parent body of this family may have not reached its current orbit by mobility caused by the yarkovsky and yorp effects , our results suggest that perhaps the ulla family parent body could have been launched into its current orbit at the time when jupiter jumped , either from regions at lower semi - major axis , as investigated in this paper , or , possibly , from the outer main belt . investigating the second scenario is , in our opinion , beyond the purposes of this work , that aimed mostly at investigating the dynamics of cybele asteroids .",
    "but it could be proposed as an interesting possible future line of research .",
    "in this work we :    * obtained high - quality synthetic proper elements for 1500 among numbered and multi - opposition asteroids in the cybele region and computed the location of two - body and three - body mean - motion resonances using the approach of gallardo ( 2014 ) for all resonances with a strength parameter @xmath12 up to @xmath13 for two - body and @xmath14 for three - body resonances . as discussed in gallardo ( 2014 ) , the number density of mean - motion resonances grows considerably for semi - major axis larger than 3.7 au . *",
    "studied the secular dynamics in the cybele region and identified the population of librators currently in non - linear secular configurations .",
    "we identified a population of 32 asteroids in @xmath26-type secular resonances , 22 of which in @xmath16 librating configurations , so confirming the important role that this resonance has in shaping the dynamical evolution of asteroids in this region ( see vokrouhlick et al . 2010 ) .",

    "we confirmed the age estimates for our families found with previous methods and found that a fraction of about 5% of the largest fragments of a hypothetical sylvia family that formed just after the lhb could have remained in the cybele region up to these days ( but would be of difficult identification ) .",
    "any family that formed from the binary asteroids camilla and hermione should have dispersed in time - scale of 1.5 gyr at most , in agreement with previous results ( vokrouhlick et al . , 2010 ) .",
