    "thin nematic film spread on liquid substrate represents a fascinating system to study the influence of interfaces on the organisation of liquid crystal ( lc ) molecules .",
    "the pioneering works by lavrentovich , sparavigna and pergamenshchik  @xcite were focused on understanding the spontaneous spreading of 5cb ( 4-pentyl-4-cyanobiphenyl ) lc on glycerol .",
    "the authors observed the formation of spatially - periodic stripes in films of submicron thickness resulting from the competition between the surface and volume energy namely between the boundary conditions and the elastic bulk anisotropy of nematic lc .",
    "one of the first models  @xcite , accounting for these observations , suggests the crucial role of the splay - bend elastic constant @xmath0 , which should not vary more than by 5% to fit the data .",
    "another model  @xcite quantifies the threshold thickness in agreement with experimental data , while the wavelength of stripes was not determined .",
    "recent systematic experiments performed by the group of cazabat  @xcite suggest that the stripe phase occurs within the range of thickness @xmath1 , where the lower threshold @xmath230  nm and the upper threshold @xmath3@xmath4 m seem to be independent of the type of substrate and lc molecules .",
    "the period @xmath5 of the stripe domains is controlled by the thickness @xmath6 of the film in a non - trivial way , yielding the ratio @xmath7 for different lc systems  @xcite .",
    "the presence of the free nematic ",
    "air interface allows the thickness of the spreading film to be adopted by the film itself rather than being a fixed parameter .",
    "the striking feature of the experiments  @xcite is the existence of a _ forbidden range of thickness _",
    ", visible as a discontinuity in microdroplet profile . at the room temperature",
    "the lower boundary is a trilayer of molecules ( @xmath8  nm ) while the upper boundary is @xmath930  nm .",
    "the structure of the film with @xmath10 is unknown , and in fact on water and glycerol striped domains coexist directly with trilayer and @xmath10 is the thickness of the thinnest striped film @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "there is no theoretical approach which could account for these experimental observations .    within the continuum theory of liquid crystals",
    "@xcite nematics are characterised by the unit vector , called the director , specifying the averaged orientation of molecules , which tend to align parallel to each other .",
    "the presence of interfaces influences the surface ordering and orientation of nematic director , also known as anchoring , which is far from being understood completely  @xcite .",
    "the conventionally assumed degenerate azimuthal anchoring on liquid substrates , does not necessarily mean that lc molecules can align along any direction simultaneously without some energy cost .",
    "rather it means that because of some microscopic ( e.g. adsorption layer  @xcite ) or geometric  @xcite reasons there is a tendency of molecules to align ( spontaneously or not ) along a common preferred direction on substrate interface . to describe the planar",
    "degenerate anchoring at the nematic  liquid substrate interface the fourth order terms of the tensorial order parameter must be included in surface free energy  @xcite .",
    "although nematics are uniaxial in the bulk , the wetting layer may exhibit biaxiality due to the lower symmetry near the surface  @xcite . according to  @xcite",
    "the biaxiality arises naturally close to a curved surfaces with imposed homeotropic anchoring ( free interface with air ) , where the order tensor becomes biaxial along the principal directions of the surface .",
    "our recent analysis  @xcite shows that without accounting for azimuthal anchoring at either of the interface , the wavelength of stripes at the lower threshold is infinite , in contradiction with experimental observations  @xcite .",
    "the presence of small azimuthal anchoring at one of the interfaces penalises strong in - plane distortions of the nematic director ( stripe domains ) and favours the common alignment of the molecules .",
    "however , contrary to the polar anchoring , the effective azimuthal anchoring can be thought of as an extrinsic parameter of our system , induced either by the thickness gradient  @xcite , biaxiality  @xcite or short - range intermolecular forces .",
    "it is known  @xcite for example , that part of ncb molecule is buried in water with a preferential orientation dictated by its short - range interactions with water , resulting in adsorbed monolayer , which then leads to the azimuthal anisotropy in ncb s orientation distribution .    in the present manuscript",
    "firstly we generalise the theoretical analysis  @xcite towards the distorted hybrid aligned nematic ( han ) state in presence of azimuthal anchoring at nematic  liquid substrate interface .",
    "this allows us to identify the _ upper threshold _ for stripe instability @xmath12 m as well as finite wavelength and amplitude of the perturbation .",
    "the predictions are robust , compatible with experimental observations of 5cb-7cb and mbba on glycerol and water and do not depend on a particular choice of elastic constants , contrary to  @xcite .",
    "next we explore the implications of simplified model on the director s configuration in unperturbed state by i )  introducing an effective azimuthal anchoring at both interfaces accounting for possible biaxial order  @xcite or ii )  assuming a certain scaling for the azimuthal and polar degrees of freedom of the nematic director .",
    "within such an _ ad hoc _ approach we find twisted state and modification of the barbero ",
    "barberi condition  @xcite .",
    "clearly these approaches are oversimplified to understand the physical picture as a whole , where the interplay between hydrodynamic and elastic instabilitites  @xcite , may lead to a nontrivial film profile extending over the micrometers and thickness discontinuity , which occurs within nanometers scale  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is a good starting point to investigate the connections between molecular and mesoscopic scale phenomena quantitatively .",
    "nematic liquid crystals are described by the unit vector @xmath13 , called the director , characterising the averaged orientation of molecules . the free energy associated with distortions of this director in space",
    "is given by [ eq : fel ] f_el = 12_v dv \\{k ||^2 - k_24 ( ( ) + ) } , where we have assumed the one - constant approximation of the oseen  zocher  frank free energy  @xcite , quadratic in the director derivatives .",
    "the elastic constant @xmath14 stands for the equal splay , twist and bend elastic moduli  @xcite , while the saddle - splay elastic constant @xmath15 should satisfy the ericksen s inequalities  @xcite [ eq : ericks ] |k_24|k , k0 , which guarantee the stability of the uniform nematic state @xmath16",
    ". the uniformly aligned director configuration can become unstable in presence of the competing boundary conditions and the saddle - splay elastic term , favouring the distorted configuration of the nematic director .",

    "<S> we identify the upper threshold for the formation of stripes and compare our results with experimental observations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the wavelength and the amplitude of the in - plane director undulations can be related to the small but finite azimuthal anchoring . within a simplified model we analyse the possibility of non - planar base state below the barbero  barberi critical thickness .    </S>",
