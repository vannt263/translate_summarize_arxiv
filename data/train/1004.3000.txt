    "the old - new interest in the problem of soliton - soliton intertaction and soliton molecules has been increasingly accumulating particularly over the past few years .",
    "this is mainly motivated by the application of optical solitons as data carriers in optical fibers @xcite and the realization of matter - wave solitons in bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "one major problem limiting the high - bit rate data transfer in optical fibers is the soliton - soliton interaction . on the one hand ,",
    "soliton - soliton interaction is considered as a problem since it may destroy information coded by solitons sequences . on the other hand",
    ", it is part of the problem s solution , since the interaction between solitons leads to the formation of stable soliton molecules which can be used as data carriers with larger `` alphabet '' @xcite .",
    "the interaction force between solitons was first studied by karpman and solovev using perturbation analysis @xcite , gordon who used the exact two solitons solution @xcite , and anderson and lisak who employed a variational approach @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the force of interaction decays exponentially with the separation between the solitons and depends on the phase difference between them such that in - phase solitons attract and out - of - phase solitons repel .",
    "this feature was demonstrated experimentally in matter - wave solitons of attractive bose - einstein condensates @xcite where a variational approach accounted for this repulsion and showed that , in spite of the attractive interatomic interaction , the phase difference between neighboring solitons indeed causes their repulsion @xcite .    for shorter separations between the solitons ,",
    "malomed @xcite used a perturbation approach to show that stationary solutions in the form of bound states of two solitons are possible .",
    "however , detailed numerical analysis showed that such bound states are unstable @xcite .",
    "stable bound states were then discovered by akhmediev @xcite and a mechanism of creating robust three - dimensional soliton molecules was suggested by crasovan _",
    "recently , soliton molecules were realized experimentally by stratmann _",
    "_ in dispersion - managed optical fibers @xcite and their phase structure was also measured @xcite .",
    "perurbative analysis was used to account theoretically for the binding mechanism and the molecule s main features @xcite .",
    "quantization of the binding energy was also predicted numerically by komarov _",
    "_ @xcite . in refs.@xcite ,",
    "a hamiltonian is constructed to describe the interaction dynamics of solitons .",
    "the mechanism by which the relative phase between the solitons leads to their force of interaction , and hence the binding mechanism , is understood only qualitatively as follows . for in - phase ( out - of - phase ) solitons , constructive ( destructive ) interference takes place in the overlap region resulting in enhancement ( reduction ) in the intensity . as a result",
    ", the attractive intensity - dependent nonlinear interaction causes the solitons to attract ( repel ) @xcite .",
    "a more quantitative description is given in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in view of its above - mentioned importance from the applications and fundamental physics point of views",
    ", we address here the problems of soliton - soliton interaction and soliton molecule formation using the exact two solitons solution .",
    "this approach has been long pioneered by gordon @xcite where he used the exact two solitons solution of the homogeneous nonlinear schr@xmath0dinger equation to derive a formula for the force of interaction between two solitons , namely @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the solitons separation and @xmath3 is their phase difference .",
    "this formula was derived in the limit of large solitons separation and for small difference in the center - of - mass speeds and intensities , which limits its validity to slow collisions",
    ". with appropriately constructed hamiltonian , wu _ et al . _",
    "have derived , essentially , a similar formula that gives the force between two identical solitons and reliefs the condition on slow collisions @xcite .    here , we present a more comprehensive treatment where we derive the force between two solitons for arbitrary solitons intensities , center - of - mass speeds , and separation .",
    "we also generalize gordon s formula to inhomogeneous cases corresponding to matter - wave bright solitons in attractive bose - einstein condensates with time - dependent parabolic potentials @xcite and to optical solitons in graded - index waveguide amplifiers @xcite .",
    "many interesting situations can thus be investigated .",
    "this includes the various soliton - soliton collision regimes with arbitrary relative speeds , intensities , and phases .",
    "most importantly , soliton - soliton interaction at short solitons separations will now be accounted for more quantitatively than before .",
    "specifically , soliton molecule formation is clearly shown to arise from the time - dependence of the relative phase which plays the role of the restoring force . in this case , the force between the two solitons is shown to be composed of a part oscillating between attractive and repulsive , which arises from the relative phase , and an attractive part that arises from the nonlinear interaction . the time - dependence of the relative phase results in a natural oscillation of the molecule s bond length around an equilibrium value .",
    "the various features of the soliton molecule , including its equilibrium _ bond length _ , _ spring constant _ , _ frequency _ and _ amplitude _ of oscillation , and _ effective mass _ , will be derived in terms of the fundamental parameters of the solitons , namely their intensities and the nonlinear interaction strength .",
    "the two solitons solution is derived here using the inverse scattering method @xcite .",
    "although the two solitons solution of the homogeneous nonlinear schr@xmath0dinger equation is readily known @xcite , here we not only generalize this solution to inhomogeneous cases , but also present it in a new form that facilitates its analysis . the solution will be given in terms of the four fundamental parameters of each soliton , namely the initial amplitude , center - of - mass position and speed , and phase .",
    "the main features of the solution will be shown clearly such as the contribution of the nonlinear interaction to the actual separation and phase difference between solitons where it turns that the separation between the two solitons increases with logarithm of the difference between the amplitudes of the two solitons .",
    "furthermore , the general statement that _ a state of two equal solitons with zero relative speed and finite separation does not exist as a stationary state for the homogeneous nonlinear schr@xmath0dinger equation _ , will be transparently and rigorously proved .",
    "stability of soliton molecules is an important issue since , in real systems , perturbations caused by various sources such as losses , raman scattering , higher order dispersion , and scattering from local impurities , tend to destroy the molecules . to investigate the stability of the soliton molecules described by our formalism , we have considered three situations .",
    "first , we studied the reflection of the molecule from a hard wall and a softer one .",
    "while for the hard wall the molecule preserves its molecular structure after reflection , it generally breaks up for the softer ones due to energy losses at the interface .",
    "secondly , the scattering of the molecule by a potential barrier was also investigated .",
    "we show that the molecular structure is maintained only for some specific heights of the barrier .",
    "this suggests a quantization in the binding energy as predicted by komarov _",
    "the oscillation period of the reflected molecule is noticed to be smaller than for the incident one .",
    "in addition , the outcome of scattering depends on the phase of the molecule s oscillation at the interface of the barrier .",
    "for instance , a dramatic change in the scattering outcome takes place if the _ coalescence _ point of the molecule lies exactly at the interface .",
    "in such a case , the otherwise totally transmitting molecule will now split into reflecting and tunneling solitons .",
    "thirdly , we have considered the collision between a single soliton with a stationary soliton molecule .",
    "the effects of different initial speeds , amplitudes , and phases of the scatterer soliton were studied .",
    "it turns out that for slower collisions , it is easier for the scatterer soliton to break up the soliton molecule , while for fast collisions the scatterer soliton expels and then replaces one of the solitons in the molecule .",
    "the phase of the scatterer soliton plays also a crucial rule in preserving or breaking the bond of the molecule , which can be used as _ key _ tool to code or uncode data in the molecule .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ exact_sec ] ,",
    "we use the inverse - scattering method to derive the two solitons solution of the inhomogeneous nonlinear schr@xmath0dinger equation and present the solution in the above - mentioned appealing form .",
    "the main features of the solution will be discussed in subsection  [ mainsec ] .",
    "the center - of - mass positions and relative phases will be derived in subsections  [ com_sec ] and [ phases_sec ] , respectively .",
    "the force between solitons will be derived in section  [ force_sec ] where gordon s formula will be extracted as a special case in subsection  [ gordon_sec ] and our more general formula will be derived in subsection  [ our_sec ] . in subsection",
    "[ num_sec ] , we compare our formula with the numerical calculation . in section  [ molsec ] , we show the possibility of forming soliton molecules , derive their main features in subsection  [ formation_sec ] , and investigate their stability in subsection  [ stability_sec ] .",
    "we end in section  [ conc_sec ] with a summary of results and conclusions .",
    "the details of the derivation of the two solitons solution and the center - of - mass positions are relegated to appendices a and b , respectively .",
    "matter - wave solitons of trapped bose - einstein condensates and optical solitons in optical fibers can be both described by the dimensionless gross - pitaevskii equation @xmath4 , time to @xmath5 , and the wavefunction @xmath6 to @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the characteristic frequencies of the quasi one - dimensional ( @xmath10 ) trapping potential in the axial and radial directions , respectively . in these units",

    "hence , @xmath41 and @xmath42 correspond to the initial center - of - mass position and speed , respectively .",
    "the second sech term contains the same features in addition to a shift in both the center - of - mass position and phase .",
    "it should be noted , however , that @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 correspond to the center - of - mass position and speed , normalization , and phase of the single noninteracting solitons . due to the interaction between solitons",
    ", these four characteristic quantities may not correspond exactly to the values of the same physical quantities as they did for the single soliton solution .",
    "for instance , @xmath37 will not correspond to the center - of - mass of one of the solitons .",
    "instead , the soliton may be shifted from that position due to the interaction with the other soliton . in the following , we present a detailed analysis of the locations and phases of the two solitons .",
    "inspection shows that there are two main regimes for the two solitons solution , namely the regime of resolved solitons and the regime of overlapping solitons . in the former case ,",
    "the center - of - mass concept is well defined and analysis of the relative dynamics becomes feasible .",
    "the solitons are considered resolved as long as the two main peaks are not overlapping , which means that partial overlap may occur in this regime .",
    "the analysis in this section assumes the resolved solitons regime .    in the resolved solitons regime ,",
    "the argument of the second sech term of eq .",
    "( [ exactsol ] ) , namely @xmath47 $ ] , simplifies to a function with three roots .",
    "the fact that the sech function is peaked at the roots of its argument , leads to that the second sech term corresponds to three `` solitons '' .",
    "this is shown in fig  [ fig1 ] .",
    "we denote these solitons as the `` left '' , `` central '' , and `` right '' solitons with peak locations at @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "we notice that the central soliton is located at the position of the soliton of the first sech term , namely near @xmath37 .",
    "further inspection shows that the two solitons at this location are out of phase and interfere destructively such that they do not appear in the total profile .",
    "therefore , the two solitons that our solution of eq .",
    "( [ exactsol ] ) describes are in fact the left and right solitons arising from the second sech term .",
    "this is different from what one aught to conclude from the form of the exact solution , namely that the first sech term corresponds to one soliton and the second sech term corresponds to the other soliton .",
    "in general , the center - of - mass locations of the left and right solitons , @xmath48 and @xmath50 , do not match @xmath37 and @xmath51 .",
    "typically , @xmath48 will be shifted to the left of @xmath37 , @xmath50 will be shifted to the right of @xmath51 , while @xmath52 remains near @xmath37 .",
    "the amount of shift depends mainly on the normalization difference @xmath53 and the relative speed @xmath54 , as will be shown in the next subsection .",
    "an interesting general and exact result is that , for the homogeneous case @xmath16 , a state of two equal solitons , @xmath55 , with zero relative speed , @xmath56 , and finite separation , does not exist as an exact solution of the gross - pitaevskii equation .",

    "furthermore , we show in section [ phases_sec ] that the phase difference between this central soliton and that of the first sech term equals , in this case , @xmath60 ; guaranteeing their destructive interference .",
    "thus , the three solitons disappear in such a special case and @xmath6 becomes the trivial solution .    in view of the above , a need arises to derive formulae for the center - of - mass positions , @xmath48 and @xmath50 in terms of the solitons parameters , which will then be used to derive the force between the two solitons .      in this section",
    ", we derive formulae for the three roots of @xmath57 which correspond to the locations of the left , central , and right solitons , @xmath48 , @xmath52 , and @xmath50 , respectively . to facilitate the derivation ,",

    "assuming , without loss of generality , @xmath71 , and noting that in the resolved solitons regime the solitons separation @xmath72 is large , we argue in appendix  [ appb1 ] that @xmath73 for all @xmath15 , @xmath74 for @xmath75 , @xmath76 for @xmath77 , and @xmath78 for @xmath79 . based on this",

    "it is established in the homogeneous case , as will also be shown in section [ molsec ] , that the time - dependence of the phase difference is responsible for binding the two solitons in the soliton molecule .",

    "this artifact divergency can be remedied by associating the location of the local maximum of @xmath57 to @xmath48 once this maximum has reached the @xmath15-axis from above .",
    "restricting our study to the region where agreement is obtained , we interestingly notice that the acceleration is oscillating between positive and negative values .",
    "this means that the force between the solitons is oscillating between attractive and repulsive .",
    "the possibility of having attractive forces for finite @xmath124 is particularly interesting ; for two solitons with nonzero relative positive speed , i.e. the solitons are initially diverging from each other , the force between them is attractive .",
    "this suggests that , if the force remains attractive for sufficient time , the two solitons will slow down and eventually converge at some point .",
    "if true , this should occur at small distances since the force decays exponentially with distance and when the two solitons are allowed to diverge even for a short while , the force might be weakened such that the two solitons can not return back . to be able to judge on such a possibility , we need to know what happens to the acceleration at later times . to that end , we calculate numerically the acceleration in terms of @xmath124 and @xmath14 .",
    "the result is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , where it is clear that the acceleration indeed decays with time for all @xmath124 .",
    "this leads to that any nontrivial effect of the oscillating force is most likely to take place at short solitons separations .",
    "this is what we find in the next section where the possibility of forming stable soliton molecules is pointed out .",
    "we have shown in the previous section that , as a result of the solitons time - dependent relative phase , the force of interaction between solitons is oscillating between repulsive and attractive .",
    "since the force decays exponentially with the solitons separations , this oscillation will have a tangible effect only when the two solitons are close to each other . in this section ,",
    "we investigate the force of interaction between solitons for short solitons separation .",
    "in such a special case , eq .  ( [ deltaeq ] ) takes a simple form that accounts for the solitons separation in terms of their relative phase . using this formula",
