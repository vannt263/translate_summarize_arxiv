    "generation of high - energy ion beams by interaction of an ultra intense laser pulse with a solid target is one of today s hot topics in laser - plasma interaction .",
    "such ion beams have properties making them very interesting for a wide range of applications , such as proton radiography  @xcite , fast ignition in the context of inertial fusion  @xcite , or hadron - therapy  @xcite .",
    "while generation of ions with energies up to several tens of  mev has already been demonstrated  @xcite , controlling their energy distribution remains a crucial issue for most applications .",
    "different mechanisms of ion acceleration have been proposed depending on whether ions originate from the front - side ( irradiated by the laser ) or the rear - side of the target .",
    "ion acceleration at the target front - side occurs mainly in the electric field resulting from electron sweeping at the front of the laser pulse  @xcite , leading to creation of collisionless electrostatic shocks  @xcite or solitary waves  @xcite . at the target rear - side",
    ", ion acceleration occurs in the strong electrostatic field resulting from charge separation due to hot electrons escaping into vacuum .",
    "this mechanism , referred to as target normal sheath acceleration ( tnsa )  @xcite , is the dominant process of ion acceleration for currently available ( moderately relativistic ) laser intensities  @xcite .",
    "tnsa provides ion beams with interesting properties , such as good laminarity , small aperture angle ( a few degree ) and relatively large efficiency of energy conversion ( a few percents ) from the laser pulse to the ions . however , the resulting ion beams have a characteristic broad ( quasi - thermal ) spectrum with a sharp cut - off at maximal energy .",
    "several proposals have been made how to control the energy distribution of laser - created ion beams .",
    "recently , efficient acceleration with relatively small energy dispersion has been observed in numerical simulations where a circularly polarized ( cp ) laser pulse was focused on a thin target  @xcite . using cp",
    "light indeed allows to strongly reduce electron heating  @xcite and therefore prevents tnsa and the associated broadening of the ion spectrum .",
    "ion acceleration then follows from a front - side mechanism referred to as laser - piston or light - sail acceleration .",
    "the whole target is accelerated as a neutral bunch , resulting in a quasi - monochromatic ion energy distribution . however , due to the non - homogeneous field in the piston , the presence of low - energy ions in the beam can not be avoided .",
    "moreover , alternative methods based on multi - species ( homogeneous or multilayered ) targets have been proposed to control the ion spectrum  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "double layer targets have attracted a lot of interest as they allow to increase ion beams monochromaticity  @xcite . in the proposed schemes",
    ", a laser pulse is focused on the first target layer that consists of heavy , highly charged , ions .",
    "electrons gain energy in the laser field and are either heated or completely extracted from the laser focal spot . in the first case ,",
    "ions of the second layer are accelerated in the ambipolar electrostatic field created at the rear - side of the first ion layer by hot electrons  @xcite . the possibility to generate 1.3  mev proton beams with energy dispersion @xmath0 and 3  mev  carbon beams with energy dispersion @xmath1 using double layer target",
    "has already been demonstrated experimentally by schwoerer  _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite and hegelich  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , respectively .",
    "the mechanisms behind these observations are similar to tnsa , and generation of hot electrons is a dominant process under present experimental conditions .",
    "this rather complex mechanism makes the control of the ion beam properties non trivial . in the second case , where electrons are removed from the target ,",
    "light ions are accelerated in the strong electrostatic field of the expanding first ion layer .",
    "this is the so - called regime of directed coulomb explosion ( dce )  @xcite .",
    "while ion acceleration in the ambipolar field is highly sensitive to the hot electron temperature and thus to the laser parameters , ion acceleration by dce depends only on the target properties , thus allowing a better control of the ion source .",
    "nevertheless , no efficient mechanism has yet been proposed to expel all electrons from the target and achieve optimal dce .    in this paper , we present an elaborated laser - based ion acceleration scheme which allows to control energy dispersion , potentially below 10  @xmath2 .",
    "this scheme relies on the complete , laser - induced , removal of electrons from an ultra - thin double layer target . to make electron sweeping by the laser radiation pressure more effective ,",
    "we make use of a cp laser beam .",
    "one - dimensional ( 1d ) and two - dimensional ( 2d ) numerical simulations are performed with the particle - in - cell ( pic ) code calder  @xcite .",
    "they show that complete extraction of electrons from the target is possible above a threshold intensity that depends mainly on the target areal charge . the resulting ion acceleration from the double layer target",
    "is then discussed using both numerical simulations and analytical modeling .",
    "first , light ions making the second target layer are accelerated in the quasi - homogeneous electrostatic field created between the first ion layer ( that consists of heavy , highly charged , ions ) and the forward - going electron cloud .",
    "this first stage , referred to as linear plasma acceleration ( linpa ) , ends when electrons are pushed far enough from the heavy ion layer .",
    "the subsequent acceleration phase of light ions depends on whether they have acquired or not relativistic velocities in the linpa stage .",
    "especially , it is shown that low - energy ions can gain further energy in a stage similar to dce , while high - energy , relativistic , ions gain most of their energy in the linpa stage of acceleration . the final energy and energy dispersion",
    "are shown to depend mainly on the target composition and geometry .",
    "because this novel mechanism of light ion acceleration depends mainly on the target properties , it is thus much less sensitive to the inevitable shot - to - shot fluctuations of the laser parameters than tnsa - based schemes .",
    "the ability to control the ion beam properties by a careful design of the target makes this acceleration process particularly interesting for applications requiring high - quality ion beams , such as hadron - therapy .",
    "our characteristic target ( see fig .  [ fig0 ] ) consists of a first layer of heavy , highly charged ions with mass @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the proton mass ) and charge @xmath5 , atomic density @xmath6 and thickness @xmath7 . in this paper ,",

    "as will be discussed later in the paper , these ions must have a charge - over - mass ratio larger than the one of the so - called heavy ions .",
    "this is usually the case for species with @xmath16 , first because of the neutron contribution to the mass of the nucleus , and second because the heavy ions may not be fully ionized .",

    "@xcite where the possibility to generate dense electron bunches with ultra - intense laser pulses with sharp rising edge is discussed .",
    "more recently , refs .",
    "@xcite have reported similar electron behavior when investigating the transition from rpa to coulomb explosion of a monolayer target .",
    "it is interesting to note that , for a given target electron density , complete extraction of all electrons indeed requires the target thickness to be smaller than the so - called optimal thickness for rpa .    for laser field amplitude @xmath40 ,",
    "electrons become relativistic almost instantaneously and the separation time scale is @xmath41 ( in units of @xmath42 ) .",

    ", we restrict our study to a 1d problem , thus the electrostatic field amplitude does not depend on the distance between the ion and electron layers . limiting multi - dimensional effect are discussed later in sec.[sec3 ] .",

    "in both limits , the relative energy dispersion remains small if the electrostatic field @xmath59 due to light ions is small compared to the accelerating field @xmath45 ( due to heavy ions ) , and it can be controlled by adjusting the target properties .",
    "the acceleration scheme then suffers limitations similar to any linear accelerator : controlling the relative energy dispersion limits the areal density of accelerated ions @xmath60 ( in units of @xmath61 ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is shown in what follows that satisfactory values of @xmath62 can be obtained using laser field amplitude @xmath63 .",

    "[ fig6]a , where the longitudinal component of the electrostatic field at the position of the proton bunch is shown as a function of time . the early stage of proton acceleration is characterized by a constant accelerating field , and its duration , @xmath68 , can be extracted from fig .",

    ", it is interesting to note that @xmath68 is not twice as long for @xmath192 as for @xmath185 .",
    "this is because in the case where @xmath192 , some electrons come back toward the ion layers and thus reduce the accelerating field prematurely . for short times , @xmath193 ,",
    "protons are consequently accelerated in the capacitor - like electrostatic field characteristic of the linpa process .",

    "in addition , figs .  [ fig6]c and  [ fig6]d show the temporal evolution of the proton bunch energy and angular dispersions . especially , fig .",
    "[ fig6]c shows that , while the proton energy dispersion is not strongly modified by increasing the laser pulse transverse width , it can be tuned by changing the density of the hydrogen dot .",

    "multi - dimensional effects thus set in , reducing the accelerating field ( fig .  [ fig6]a ) and making proton acceleration less efficient ( fig .  [ fig6]b ) .",
    "while the proton energy in the linpa stage of ion acceleration did not depend on the transverse width @xmath24 of the laser pulse , increasing @xmath24 allows to enhance the final proton energy by delaying multi - dimensional effects .",
    "furthermore , in this second stage of proton acceleration , one can observe an enhancement of both the energy and angular dispersion of the proton bunch ( figs .",
    "[ fig6]c and  [ fig6]d ) . while energy dispersion is still mainly determined by the charge in the second layer ( fig .",

    "this prompts us to suggest that , in this phase of the acceleration process , both the transverse inhomogeneity of the accelerating field and coulomb self - repulsion are responsible for the proton bunch angular aperture . at the end of the simulation , energy dispersion of the order of @xmath197 and angular aperture @xmath198",

    "we obtain the traveled distance @xmath204 and the light ion layer thickness @xmath205 at the end of the linpa stage : @xmath206 in what follows , we shall show that light ions exhibit two distinct long - time behaviors depending on whether or not they are relativistic at the end of the linpa stage .",
    "\\(i ) as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , for effective laser powers below @xmath207 ( which also corresponds to @xmath208 ) , light ions are non - relativistic at the end of the linpa stage . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) and  ( [ eq6 ] ) , we obtain that such ions have propagated on a distance @xmath209 during this first stage , while the light ion layer thickness has increased to @xmath210 . for most parameters of interest ,",
    "this thickness @xmath211 remains much smaller than the transverse width @xmath22 , so that the light ion layer conserves its pancake - like shape .",
    "moreover , because @xmath212 , light ions remains close to the heavy ion layer at the end of the non - relativistic linpa stage . as a consequence , they will gain further energy in the electrostatic field due to heavy ions while the effect of the electron cloud on ion acceleration for @xmath213 can be neglected .",
    "the acceleration process then becomes similar to dce , with the difference that particles have a finite initial kinetic energy . considering that both light and heavy ion layers retain their disk - like shape and that the distance between both layers @xmath214 remains small compared to the transverse width @xmath196 , the accelerating field at the rear side of the heavy ion layer behaves as @xmath215 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors assume that the field inhomogeneity @xmath216 through the second layer is responsible for both , light ions bunching and energy dispersion .",
    "however , they do not account for the self - consistent field @xmath59 in the second layer that , under conditions of interest in our work , exceeds the field inhomogeneity @xmath217 .",
    "we thus find that the field inhomogeneity weakly affects the long - time ( @xmath218 ) energy dispersion of light ions , which mainly originates from electrostatic repulsion between the protons , as previously observed in 2d simulations ( sec .",
    "[ simu2d ] ) .",
    "the energy gain of light ions during the dce stage can be estimated from their potential energy in the heavy ion electrostatic field , while their energy dispersion is obtained from their potential energy in the self - consistent field @xmath59 : @xmath219 the first term in the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) is similar to estimates obtained in ref .",
    "the second term accounts for the fact that , in contrast to what occurs in `` classical '' dce , part of the potential energy of light ions has already been transformed into kinetic energy in the linpa stage . obviously ,",
    "because light ions have not traveled far from the heavy ions layer during the non - relativistic linpa stage under current conditions , the dce stage provides the main contribution to the final energy of accelerated ions .",
    "finally , the light ion energy at @xmath218 is simply @xmath220 and it scales as the square - root of the laser power .",
    "moreover , the relative energy dispersion @xmath221 is obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) and  ( [ eq8 ] ) .",
    "it can be kept to a rather low level assuming that both the electrostatic field @xmath59 in the light ion layer and the transverse width @xmath22 of this layer are small compared to the accelerating field @xmath45 and the transverse width @xmath196 , respectively .",
    "in addition , we want to point out that previous considerations on 3d electron behavior on long times ( sec .  [ temp ] ) suggest that the ion beam leaves the target as a non - neutral bunch .",
    "the effect of electrons on long time scales , which can be disastrous in terms of energy dispersion , can thus be neglected : coulomb repulsion of the light ions is the main source of energy dispersion .",
    "\\(ii ) for laser powers above @xmath207 , light ions gain relativistic energies in the linpa stage and the acceleration process beyond @xmath68 is modified . indeed , taking @xmath222 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) and  ( [ eq6 ] ) , we obtains that light ions have traveled over a distance @xmath223 in the linpa , while their thickness as increased to @xmath224 .",
    "once more , for characteristic parameters of interest , @xmath225 , and the light ion bunch keeps its pancake - shape .",
    "however , considering that electrons have propagated on a distance @xmath226 , light ions should stay close to the electron cloud at the end of the linpa stage ( @xmath227 ) .",
    "therefore , in a second stage , light ions may gain further energy in the field due to the electron cloud , which is continuously pushed by the laser pulse .",
    "this scenario might prove very interesting for generating high - quality relativistic ion beams .",
    "nevertheless , a full 3d modeling is required to quantitatively account for the non - trivial long - time electron behavior",
    ". this will be the subject of future studies .",
    "in this paper , we propose a novel ion acceleration mechanism allowing for an excellent control of all ion beam properties .",
    "this mechanism is based on complete removal of electrons from an ultra - thin double layer target by radiation pressure .",
    "the consequences of this mechanism in terms of ion acceleration are discussed here for the first time .",
    "numerical simulations show that complete expulsion of electrons from the target can be achieved above a laser intensity threshold that depends on the areal charge of the irradiated target as well as on the pulse profile and polarization . for a nano - scale target irradiated by a cp laser pulse , laser field amplitudes @xmath228 ,",
    "typically , are required .",
    "we discuss acceleration of light ions of a double - layer target , in a regime where a capacitor - like , quasi - homogeneous , electrostatic field is built up between the ion and electron layers .",
    "the resulting acceleration process is referred to as linpa .",
    "it may accelerate light ions up to high energies over a few optical cycles only , with an energy dispersion that can be controlled by the target properties ( areal charge and geometry ) .",
    "generation of relativistic light ions during this stage is also expected when using an effective laser power larger than @xmath207 , proportional to the squared inverse charge - over - mass ratio . for protons ,",
    "this threshold power is of a few petawatt .    beyond this transient linpa stage ,",
    "the light ion acceleration is determined by multi - dimensional effects .",
    "analytical considerations suggest that two scenarii should be considered depending on whether or not light ions have acquired relativistic velocities at the end of the linpa stage . while low energy ion generation mainly follows from dce ,",
    "relativistic ions are mainly accelerated in the linpa stage and may gain further energy in the electron cloud field afterwards . in between ,",
    "modeling from the linpa should provide good estimates for the ion source properties .",
    "the energy dispersion of the resulting ion source follows mainly from coulomb self - repulsion of the light ions .",
    "energy dispersion is shown to depend mainly on the ratio of the areal charge in the two layers and on the target geometry .",
    "an excellent control of the energy , energy dispersion as well as total charge of the light ion beam can thus be achieved by choosing appropriate target properties .",
    "this approach thus appears to be extremely attractive for applications such as proton therapy , where high - quality ion beams are required .",
    "multi - dimensional effects are partly accounted for in our theoretical model , but , at the present stage , we can only give rough estimates on expected ion beam properties .",
    "moreover , we do not discuss the complex behavior of electrons when they are strongly accelerated by the laser pulse . in a realistic 3d configuration",
    ", inhomogeneities in the laser intensity distribution will definitely affect this process .",
    "as already observed by other authors  @xcite , rayleigh - taylor - like or weibel instabilities may occur .",
    "another mechanism likely to influence the electron behavior and in turn ion acceleration is the radiation friction experienced by ultra - relativistic electrons in the presence of a high - amplitude laser field .",
    "all these effects on ion acceleration are beyond the scope of this work and are left for future investigations .",
    "the drawbacks of the proposed light ion acceleration scheme are similar to those of other methods based on the irradiation of a thin double - layer target by high power lasers .",
    "first , maintaining the integrity of such thin targets requires ultra - high contrast laser pulses ( in excess of @xmath229 ) . also , the conversion efficiency from the laser to light ion is rather small and most of the absorbed laser energy goes to electrons and heavy ions .",
    "moreover , techniques to separate the high - quality light ion beam for other particles such as heavy ions and electrons must be considered . while this is greatly simplified by the fact that all particles have different charge - over - mass ratio , standard deflection and shielding techniques",
    "may drastically enhance the size of the ion source .",
    "experimental exploration of this acceleration mechanism requires petawatt lasers with well - controlled temporal profile and the design of nano - structured targets , such as diamond - like carbon foils .",
    "fast developments in the technology of high - power lasers  @xcite and ultra - thin target fabrication  @xcite may make generation of high - quality , well - controlled , light ion beams feasible in a near future .",
    "finally , let us note that the possibility to obtain high - energy ions on very short time scales ( a few optical cycles ) makes our mechanism particularly interesting for investigation at high - power , modest energy , laser facilities such as eli  @xcite .",
