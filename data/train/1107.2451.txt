    "recently , since the developments of both hardware and software in computer science enable us to simulate complex physical processes numerically , such computer simulations become more important from industrial viewpoints .",
    "especially the computation of the incompressible multi - phase fluid dynamics has crucial roles in order to evaluate the behavior of several devices and materials in a micro - region , _",
    "e.g. _ , ink - jet printers , solved toners and so on . in the evaluation , it is strongly required that the fluid interfaces with multiple junctions are stably and naturally computed from these practical reasons .    in this article , in order to handle the fluid interfaces with multiple junctions in a three dimensional micro - region , we investigate a surface tension of an incompressible multi - phase flow with multiple junctions as a numerical computational method under the assumption that the reynolds number is not so large . in the investigation",
    ", we encounter many interesting mathematical objects and results , which are associated with low dimensional interface geometry having singularities , and with the infinite dimensional geometry of incompressible fluid dynamics .",
    "further since even in a macroscopic theory , we introduce artificial intermediate regions in the material interfaces among different fluids or among a solid and fluids , the regions give a resolution of the singularities in the interfaces to provide extended euler equations naturally . thus even though we consider the multi - phase fluid model as a computational model , we believe that it must be connected with mathematical nature of real fluid phenomena as their description .",
    "we will mention the background , the motivation and the strategy of this study more precisely as follows .",
    "for a couple of decades , in order to represent the physical process with the interfaces of the multi - phase fluids , the computational schemes have been studied well .",
    "these schemes are mainly classified into two types .",
    "the first type is based on the level - set method @xcite discovered by h - k .",
    "zhao , t. chan , b. merriman , s. osher and l. wang @xcite .",
    "the second one is based on the phase - field theory , which was found by j. u. brakbill , d. b. kothe and c. zemach @xcite , and b. lafaurie , c. nardone , r. scardovelli , s. zaleski , and g. zanetti @xcite .",
    "the authors in reference @xcite called the scheme surfer . following them ,",
    "there are many studies on the surfer scheme , _",
    "e.g. _ , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* references therein ) .",
    "the level - set method is a computational method in which we describe a ( hyper-)surface in terms of zeros of the level - set function , _",
    "i.e. _ , a real function whose value is a signed distance from the surface , such as @xmath2 in section [ sec : two - one ] . using the scheme based upon the level - set method in the three dimensional euclidean space , we can deal well with topology changes , geometrical objects with singularities , _",
    "e.g. _ , cusps , the multiple junctions of materials , and so on .",
    "however in the computation , we need to deal with the constraint conditions even for two - phase fluids @xcite .",
    "a dynamical problem with constraint conditions is basically complicate and sometimes gives difficulties to find its solution since the constraint conditions sometimes generate an ill - posed problem in the optimization . in the numerical computation for incompressible fluid",
    ", we must check the consistency between the incompressible condition and the constraint condition .",
    "the check generally requires a complicate implementation of the algorithm , and increases computational cost .",
    "its failure sometimes makes the computation unstable , especially when we add some other physical conditions .",
    "since instability disturbs the evaluation of a complex system as a model of a real device , it must be avoided .    on the other hand , using the surfer scheme @xcite , we can easily compute effects of the surface tension of a two - phase fluid in the navier - stokes equation .",
    "the phase field model is the model that we represent materials in terms of supports of smooth functions which roughly correspond to the partition of unity in pure mathematics ( * ? ? ?",
    "* i p.272 ) as will be mentioned in sections [ sec : four ] and [ sec : five ] .",
    "we call these functions color functions or phase fields .",
    "the phase fields have artificial intermediate regions which represent their interfaces approximately . in the surfer scheme @xcite ,",
    "the surface tension is given as a kind of stress force , or volume force due to the intermediate region .",
    "hence the scheme makes the numerical computations of the surface tension stable .",
    "however it is not known how to consider a multi - phase ( @xmath0-phase , @xmath1 ) flow in their scheme . in reference",
    "@xcite , the authors propose a method as an extension of the surfer scheme @xcite to the contact angle problem by imposing a constraint to fix its angle . in this article",
    ", we will generalize the surfer scheme to multi - phase flow without any constraints .",
    "nature must not impose any constraints even at such a triple junction , which is governed by a physical principle .",
    "if it is a hamiltonian system , its determination must obey the minimal principle or the variational principle .",
    "we wish to find a theoretical framework in which we can consistently handle the incompressible flows with interfaces including the surface tensions and the multiple junctions without any constraints . as the multiple junctions should be treated as singularities in a mathematical framework which are very difficult to be handled in general , it is hard to extend mathematical approaches for fluid interface problems without a multiple junction @xcite to a theory for the problem with multiple junctions .",
    "our purpose of this article is to find such a theoretical framework which enables us to solve the fluid interface problems with multiple junctions numerically as an extension of the surfer scheme .    for the purpose",
    ", we employ the phase field model .",
    "the thickness of the actual intermediate region in the interface between a solid and a fluid or between two fluids is of atomic order and is basically negligible in the macroscopic theory .",
    "however the difference between zero and the limit to zero sometimes brings a crucial difference in physics and mathematics ; for example , in the sato hyperfunction theory , the delta function is regarded as a function in the boundary of the holomorphic functions @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "as mentioned above , the phase field model has the artificial intermediate region which is controlled by a small parameter @xmath5 and appears explicitly even as a macroscopic theory .",
    "we regard that it represents the effects coming from the actual intermediate region of materials .",
    "namely , we regard that the stress force expression in the surfer scheme is caused by the artificial intermediate region of the phase - fields and it represents well the surface effect coming from that of real materials .    in order to extend the stress force expression of the two - phase flow to that of the multi - phase ( @xmath0-phase , @xmath1 ) flow",
    ", we will first reformulate the surfer scheme in the framework of the variational theory . in reference",
    "@xcite , a similar attempt was reported but unfortunately there were not precise derivations .",
    "our investigations in section [ sec : four ] show that the surface tension expression of the surfer scheme is derived as a momentum conservation in noether s theorem @xcite and its derivation requires a generalization of the laplace equation @xcite as the euler - lagrange equation @xcite , which is not trivial even for a static case . in order to deal with this problem in a dynamics case consistently , we should also consider the euler equation in the framework of the variational principle .",
    "it is well - known that the incompressible fluid dynamics is geometrically interpreted as a variational problem of an infinite dimensional lie group , related to diffeomorphism , due to v. i. arnold @xcite , d. ebin and j. marsden @xcite , h. omori @xcite and so on . following them ,",
    "there are so many related works @xcite . on the reformulation of the surfer scheme @xcite for the dynamical case",
    ", we introduce an action integral including the kinematic energy of the incompressible fluid and the surface energy .",
    "the variational method reproduces the governing equation in the surfer scheme .",
    "after then , we extend the surface energy to that of multi - phase fields and add the energy term to the action integral .",
    "the variational principle of the action integral leads us to a novel expression of the surface tension and the extended euler equation which we require . using the extended euler equation",
    ", we can deal with the surface tensions of the multi - phase flows , the multiple junctions of the of phase fields including singularities , the topology changes and so on .",
    "we can also compute a wall effect naturally and a contact angle problem .",
    "the computation of the governing equation is freed from any constraints , except the incompressible condition .",
    "in other words , in this article , we completely unify the theory of the multi - phase ( @xmath0-phase , @xmath1 ) field and the theory of the incompressible fluid dynamics of euler equation as an infinite dimensional geometrical problem .",
    "contents are as follows : section [ sec : two ] is devoted to the preliminaries of the theory of surfaces in our euclidean space from a low - dimensional differential geometrical viewpoint @xcite and noether s theorem in the classical field theory @xcite .",
    "section [ sec : three ] reviews the derivation of the euler equation to the incompressible fluid dynamics following the variational method for an infinite - dimensional lie algebra based upon reference @xcite . in section [ sec : four ] , we reformulate the surfer scheme @xcite . there",
    "the laplace equation for the surface tension and the euler equation in reference @xcite are naturally obtained by the variational method in propositions [ prop:4 - 4 ] and [ prop:4 - 6 ] .",
    "section [ sec : five ] is our main section in which we extend the theory in reference @xcite to that for a multi - phase flow and obtain the euler equation with the surface tension of the multi - phase field in theorem [ th:5 - 2 ] .",
    "the extended euler equation for the multi - phase flow is derived from the variational principle of the action integral in theorem [ th:5 - 1 ] . as a special case",
    ", we also derive the euler equation to a two - phase field with wall effects in theorem [ th:5 - 3 ] . in section 6 , using these methods in the computational fluid dynamics @xcite , we consider numerical computations of the contact angle problem of a two - phase field because the contact angle problem for the two - phase field circumscribed in a wall is the simplest non - trivial triple junction problem . by means of our scheme , for given surface tension coefficients ,",
    "we show two examples of the numerical computations in which the contact angles automatically appeared without any geometrical constraints and any difficulties for the singularities at triple junctions .",
    "the computations were very stable .",
    "precisely speaking , as far as we computed , the computations did not collapse for any boundary conditions and for any initial conditions .",
    "in this subsection , we review the theory of surfaces from the viewpoint of low - dimensional differential geometry .",
    "the interface problems have been also studied for last three decades in pure mathematics , which are considered as a revision of the classical differential geometry @xcite from a modern point of view @xcite , _",
    "e.g. _ , generalizations of the weierstrass - ennpper theory of the minimal surfaces , isothermal surfaces , constant curvature surfaces , constant mean curvature surfaces , willmore surfaces and so on .",
    "they are also closely connected with the harmonic map theory and the theory of the variational principle @xcite .",
    "we consider a smooth surface @xmath6 embedded in three dimensional euclidean space @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath8 be of the cartesian coordinate system and represent a point in @xmath7 , and let the surface @xmath6 be locally expressed by a local parameter @xmath9 .",
    "we assume that the surface @xmath6 is expressed by zeros of a real valued smooth function @xmath10 over @xmath7 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath11 such that in the region whose @xmath12 is sufficiently small ( @xmath13 for a positive number @xmath14 ) , @xmath15 agrees with the infinitesimal length in the euclidean space .",

    "the function @xmath10 can be locally regarded as so - called the level - set function @xcite .",
    "we could redefine the domain of @xmath10 such that it is restricted to a tubular neighborhood @xmath21 of @xmath6 , @xmath22 over @xmath21 , @xmath10 agrees with the level - set function of @xmath6 .",
    "there we can naturally define a projection map @xmath23 and then we can regard @xmath21 as a fiber bundle over @xmath6 , which is homeomorphic to the normal bundle @xmath24 .",
    "however the level - set function is defined as a signed distance function which is a global function over @xmath7 as a continuous function @xcite and thus it has no natural projective structure in general ; for example , the level - set function @xmath25 of a sphere with radius @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 which induces the natural projective ( fiber ) structure but the origin @xmath28 in the sphere case .",
    "the level - set function has no projective structure at @xmath28 in this case , and we can not define its differential there . in other words , the level - set function is not a global function over @xmath7 as a smooth function in general .",

    "even though the phase - field model has the artificial intermediate regions with unphysical thickness @xmath231 , our theory supplies a model which shows how to evaluate their effects on the surface tension forces , from geometrical viewpoints .",
    "the key fact of the model is that we express the low - dimensional geometry in terms of the infinite - dimensional vector spaces , or",

    "thus we can treat them in the framework of infinite dimensional lie group @xcite to consider its euler equation .",
    "it is contrast to the level - set method ; in analytic geometry and algebraic geometry , zeros of a function expresses a geometrical object and thus the level - set method is so natural from the point of view .",
    "however as mentioned in section [ sec : two - one ] , the level - set function can not be a global functions as @xmath103 and thus it is difficult to handle the method in the framework of the infinite dimensional lie group @xmath83 .    as our approach gives a resolution of the singularities by a parameter @xmath231 , in future we will explore topology changes , geometrical objects with singularities and so on , more concretely in our theoretical framework .",
    "when @xmath231 approaches to zero , we need more rigorous arguments in terms of hyperfunctions @xcite but we conjecture that our results would be correct for the vanishing limit of @xmath231 because the heaviside function is expressed by @xmath569 in the sato hyperfunction theory , which could be basically identified with @xmath570 of the finite @xmath231 . since an application of the sato hyperfunction theory to fluid dynamics was reported by imai on vortex layer and so on @xcite , we believe that this approach might give another collaboration between pure mathematics and fluid mechanics",
