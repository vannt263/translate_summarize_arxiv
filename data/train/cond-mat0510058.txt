    "surface and interface growth processes attract much interest for their applications in solid state physics and material science  @xcite .",
    "they motivated the study of many interface growth models , which led to significant advances in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics and related fields  @xcite .",
    "the simplest quantitative characteristic of a given interface is its roughness , also called the interface width , defined as the rms fluctuation of the height around its average position .",
    "the squared width , @xmath5 , is usually averaged over different configurations , and its scaling on time and length is used to characterize the growth process . for short times , in the so - called growth regime , the average roughness increases as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the growth exponent . for long times in a finite substrate , a steady state is attained , where the average roughness scales with the linear size @xmath8 as @xmath9 with @xmath10 called the roughness exponent ( notice that steady state averages are denoted without further labels here , while indexes @xmath11 or @xmath12 are frequently used in the literature to denote saturation ) .",
    "the connection of discrete or continuous growth models to certain growth equations is frequently based on accurate numerical calculation of those scaling exponents .",
    "however , this procedure may be quite difficult when huge finite - size or finite - time corrections are present in the scaling of @xmath13 .",
    "alternatively , one may investigate features of the full roughness distribution , @xmath14 , which is the probability density of the roughness of a given configuration to lie in the range @xmath15 $ ] . in recent years , the steady state distributions of several interface models",
    "have been analyzed  @xcite and they were shown to fit the scaling form @xmath16 alternatively , the scaling relation @xmath17 can be adopted , where @xmath18 is the rms deviation of the squared roughness . despite the study of roughness distributions being useful for determining the universality classes of some growth processes , it is usually performed independently of the calculation of scaling exponents ( notice that the values of the exponents are not necessary to fit the scaled distributions ) .",
    "indeed , finite - size corrections in the universal functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 are typically much smaller than those in the family - vicsek scaling relation  @xcite , which gives eq .",
    "( [ defalpha ] ) a limiting case .    on the other hand , from eqs .",
    "( [ scaling2 ] ) and ( [ defsigma ] ) , we expect that the roughness fluctuation @xmath0 in the steady state scales with exponent @xmath10 as the average roughness : @xmath21 consequently , numerical estimates of @xmath0 may also be used to estimate @xmath10 , but , as far as we know , this was not done in previous works .",
    "the expectation of weaker finite - size corrections using @xmath0 instead of @xmath22 follows from the recent observation  @xcite that eq .",
    "( [ scaling2 ] ) provides a better data collapse of simulation data when compared to eq .",
    "( [ scaling1 ] ) , for several growth models .    in order to estimate a scaling exponent with accuracy ,",
    "the standard method is to extrapolate effective exponents obtained from consecutive slopes of log - log plots ( see , e. g. , appendix a of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    ", we will show that the effective exponents obtained from @xmath0 provide reliable estimates of the roughness exponent and , in some cases , varies with @xmath8 slower than the estimates from the average width @xmath22 .",
    "this is illustrated with applications to three growth models which belong to different universality classes , in one- and two - dimensional substrates .",
    "subsequently , we will apply this method to calculate the roughness exponent of two versions of the ballistic depositon ( bd ) model  @xcite in two - dimensional substrates .",
    "numerical works showed discrepancies in the estimates of that exponent in @xmath23 and a rigorous derivation of a continuous equation for bd  @xcite deviates from the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation  @xcite .",
    "however , when effective exponents of bd are calculated with @xmath0 , the asymptotic estimates of @xmath10 are close to the best known kpz values .",
    "the conclusion that this is the universality class of bd is reinforced by the comparison of the full roughness distributions .    the rest of this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we present the models which will be used to test the method for estimating roughness exponents and the results of these tests . in sec .",
    "3 we apply that method to two versions of bd in @xmath23 and analyze their roughness distributions . in sec",
    "4 we summarize our results and conclusions .",
    "the first model analyzed here is the rsos model  @xcite , in which the incident particle can stick at the top of a column only if the differences of heights of all pairs of neighboring columns do not exceed @xmath24 after aggregation .",
    "otherwise , the aggregation attempt is rejected .",
    "the second model was proposed for etching of a crystalline solid by mello et al  @xcite : at each growth attempt , a randomly chosen column @xmath25 , with current height @xmath26 , has its height increased of one unit ( @xmath27 ) , and all neighboring column whose heights are smaller than @xmath28 grows to @xmath28 ( this may be called the growth version of the etching model  @xcite ) .    in the limit of large lengths and long times ,",
    "these models are represented by the kpz equation  @xcite @xmath29 here , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are constants and @xmath32 is a gaussian noise with zero mean and variance @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the dimension of the substrate . in @xmath35 ,",
    "the exact roughness exponent is @xmath36  @xcite , and in @xmath23 the best numerical estimates are around @xmath37  @xcite .",
    "numerical estimates of @xmath22 for the rsos and etching models in @xmath35 provide estimates of exponents which converge to the exact values with negligible finite - size corrections",
    ". however , that is not the case in @xmath23 , particularly for the etching model  @xcite , consequently our tests will focus this case .",
    "the widths @xmath22 and their fluctuations @xmath0 were calculated at the steady states in two - dimensional substrates up to @xmath38 for the rsos model and up to @xmath39 for the etching model .",
    "finite - size estimates of the roughness exponents are given by @xmath40 } \\over \\ln{2 } } \\label{defalphaw}\\ ] ] and @xmath41 } \\over \\ln{2 } } .",
    "\\label{defalphas}\\ ] ] the presence of significant corrections to eqs . ( [ defalpha ] ) and ( [ scalingsigma ] ) is reflected in a size - dependence of @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "these effective exponents are shown in fig . 1 for the rsos and the etching models as a function of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "an asymptotic estimate near @xmath46 is consistent with the trend of the rsos data as @xmath47 . for this model ,",
    "small differences in the estimates obtained from @xmath22 and @xmath0 are observed , as well as weak finite - size effects .",
    "the linear fit of @xmath48 shown in fig .",
    "1 suggests @xmath49 .",
    "however , the finite - size dependence of the data for the etching model is remarkable : the effective exponents vary between @xmath50 and @xmath51 in fig .",
    "1 . for the largest lengths @xmath8",
    ", @xmath43 approaches the asymptotic region @xmath49 faster than @xmath48 , as illustrated by the curves through the data points in fig .",
    "it suggests that , for large @xmath8 , the corrections to the scaling of @xmath0 are smaller than the corrections to @xmath22 . although the fits of the data in fig .",
    "1 do not represent systematic extrapolation procedures , our interpretation is reinforced by the fact that the extrapolated @xmath43 for the etching model is very close to the value predicted by the rsos model .    for the etching model , we were not able to perform reliable extrapolations of @xmath48 or @xmath43 as functions of @xmath52 , with any exponent @xmath53 ( the value @xmath54 is used in fig .",
    "1 ) . this is related to the large deviations from the asymptotic scaling in small lattices , typically @xmath55 .",
    "it contrasts to ref .",
    "@xcite , where a extrapolation of @xmath42 up to @xmath56 was possible with @xmath57 .",
    "however , here we are working with data for @xmath58 because there are very large error bars in the estimates of @xmath0 for larger lattices . with a small number of data points , even more sophisticated extrapolation methods  @xcite are not able to provide better estimates than previous work .    an extended version of the conserved rsos ( crsos ) model is also suitable for this test .",
    "in this model , if the aggregation at the column of incidence disobeys the condition @xmath59 , then the incident particle executes a random walk among neighboring columns until finding a column in which it can aggregate  @xcite .",
    "the crsos model belongs to the class of the nonlinear molecular - beam epitaxy equation , or villain - lai - das sarma ( vlds ) equation  @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are constants .",
    "our extended version of the crsos model is different from the original one  @xcite but has the same symmetries and , consequently , belong to the same universality class .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the effective exponents of this model obtained from simulations up to @xmath38 , with linear fits of both data sets .",
    "the evolution of @xmath43 and @xmath48 suggest @xmath63 asymptotically , but the difference between @xmath43 and the asymptotic value is clearly much smaller .",
    "this is consistent with the different slopes of the linear fits shown in fig .",
    "2 ( smaller slope for fitting @xmath64 ) .    this application provides additional support to the conclusion that @xmath65 in the vlds class in @xmath35  @xcite ( @xmath66 is obtained from one - loop renormalization ) .",
    "the estimate @xmath4 follows from the extrapolation of those data .",
    "it improves our previous estimate @xmath67 , obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , where effective exponents were calculated from the second and fourth moments of the height distribution in sizes up to @xmath56 .",
    "the above analysis , performed with models in different universality classes and with noticeable ( but not huge ) finite - size corrections to eq . ( [ defalpha ] ) , shows that roughness exponents may be estimated from @xmath0 with comparable or higher accuracy than those obtained from @xmath68 , suggesting its application to controversial situations .",
    "in the simplest version of the ballistic deposition model , particles are released from a randomly chosen position above a @xmath34-dimensional substrate , follow trajectories perpendicular to the surface and stick upon first contact with a nearest neighbor occupied site  @xcite .",
    "the resulting aggregate is porous and has a rough surface .",
    "several applications of the bd model or its extensions to real growth processes were already proposed , which justifies the present analysis ( see e. g. recent applications in refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the mechanism of lateral aggregation suggests that bd is in the kpz class . however , several numerical works on this model showed discrepancies between the estimated exponents and the kpz values  @xcite . in a recent work",
    ", we have shown that the kpz values are obtained with good accuracy in @xmath35 if effective exponents @xmath48 are properly extrapolated  @xcite . in @xmath23",
    ", the effective roughness exponents rapidly vary with @xmath8 , but they are still far from the region @xmath69 $ ] up to @xmath39  @xcite . an apparent consistency with the kpz value is obtained in @xmath23 only after assuming of a constant correction term in eq . ( [ defalpha ] ) ( the intrinsic width ) , but error bars are very large  @xcite .",
    "consequently , from numerical work , there is no clear evidence that bd is in the kpz class in @xmath23 .",
    "recently , katzav and schwartz derived a continuous equation for another version of bd which differs from the kpz equation  @xcite .",
    "they analyzed the bd model with next - nearest neighbor aggregation , hereafter called bdnnn , in which the incident particle sticks upon first contact with a nearest neighbor or with a next - nearest neighbor occupied site . in @xmath35",
    ", they showed that the squared gradient in eq .",
    "( [ kpz ] ) is replaced by the absolute value of the gradient in the continuous equation corresponding to bdnnn .",
    "this is suggested as a possible reason for the slow convergence of the scaling exponents to their asymptotic values . in @xmath70",
    "the situation is more complicated : the only contribution to the local growth rate comes from the direction @xmath71 along which the height gradient is maximum , and that contribution is @xmath72 .",
    "this accounts for the maximal growth ingredient of the model .",
    "however , the presence of the lattice axis in that equation contrasts with the rotation symmetry of the kpz equation .",
    "thus , also from analytical work , there is no a priori reason to expect bd to be in the kpz class  @xcite .",
    "this scenario motivates the extension of our method to estimate roughness exponents of bd and bdnnn in @xmath23 .",
    "simulations of both models were performed in lattices up to @xmath39 , where @xmath68 and @xmath0 can be obtained with reasonable accuracy .",
    "the number of different realizations used to estimate those quantities were near @xmath73 for @xmath74 , @xmath75 for @xmath38 and @xmath76 for @xmath39 .    in fig .",
    "3a we show @xmath48 and @xmath43 for the original bd model .",
    "@xmath48 rapidly varies with @xmath8 in the whole range of our data and attains a value near @xmath77 in the largest lattice , which is much smaller than the estimates for the kpz class .",
    "this complex finite - size behavior was already pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite and , consequently , no reliable extrapolation of @xmath10 could be extracted from those data . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath43 is in the range @xmath78 $ ] for the largest @xmath8 . as @xmath79 , fig .",
    "3a indicates that @xmath43 converges to an asymptotic value between @xmath80 and @xmath81 .    in fig .",
    "3b we show the effective exponents for the bdnnn model .",
    "we notice that @xmath48 is even farther from the kpz estimate in this model .",
    "however , the trend of @xmath43 as @xmath79 suggests an asymptotic value between @xmath82 and @xmath81 , although finite - size effects seem to be much stronger than those of the original bd model",
    ".    extrapolations of @xmath48 and @xmath64 for bd and bdnnn as functions of @xmath83 , varying the exponent @xmath84 along the same lines of ref .",
    "@xcite , were also tested , but no significant improvement of the above mentioned estimates was obtained . however ,",
    "those estimates are consistent with the best currently avaiable values for the kpz class , which lie in the range @xmath85 $ ]  @xcite , which strongly suggests that bd and bdnnn are also in that class in @xmath23 .",
    "another important test is a comparison of the full roughness distributions of these models and that of other kpz models .",
    "the distribution for the rsos model , which shows negligible finite - size effects , can be used as a representative of the kpz class  @xcite . in fig .",
    "4 we show this distribution , scaled according to eq .",
    "( [ scaling2 ] ) , and the scaled distributions for the bd and the bdnnn models in @xmath38 ( data for @xmath39 was not used here due to their lower accuracy , mainly in the tails of the distribution ) .",
    "the collapse of all data into a single universal curve reinforces our conclusion that both models are in the kpz class in @xmath23 .    a quantitative support to the universality of the scaled distributions of fig .",
    "4 is given by the estimates of the skewness and kurtosis of those curves .",
    "for the rsos and the etching models , @xmath86 and @xmath87 were obtained in ref .",
    "here , for bd we obtained @xmath88 and @xmath89 , and for bdnnn we obtained @xmath90 and @xmath91 , both in good agreement with the values of the other kpz models .",
    "we proposed the calculation of roughness exponents from the scaling of roughness fluctuations @xmath0 in the steady states .",
    "tests for two models in the @xmath2-dimensional kpz class and for a model in the @xmath3-dimensional vlds class were performed and showed that effective exponents obtained from that quantity provide comparable or better asymptotic estimates than the average width @xmath1 .",
    "we also applied this method to two versions of the ballistic deposition model , the original one ( bd ) and the next - nearest neighbor one ( bdnnn ) , in order to clarify a controversy on its universality class raised by numerical results and an exact derivation of its corresponding continuous equation .",
    "effective exponents calculated from @xmath0 suggest that the asymptotic class is kpz , while those calculated from @xmath13 show much more complex finite - size behavior .",
    "additional support to this conclusion is obtained from the collapse of the full roughness distributions of those models into the distribution of the rsos model .    at this point",
    "it is important to recall that higher moments of the height distribution , such as the fourth moment @xmath92 , are also frequently used to estimate the roughness exponent .",
    "their accuracy is usually lower than that of @xmath22 and , consequently , do not improve the estimates of @xmath10 ( see e. g. ref .",
    "this quantity , however , must not be confused with @xmath93 , which is the fluctuation of the global roughness in the steady state .    the successful application of the above method to estimate the roughness exponent , possibly combined with the analysis of roughness distributions , suggests its extension to other models in which remarkable finite - size corrections in the effective exponents are observed ."
