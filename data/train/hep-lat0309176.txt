    "lattice studies of the baryonic system consisting of three static quarks ( 3q ) are important for clarification of the baryon structure .",
    "recently there appeared a number of papers devoted to the studies of the 3q system at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "it was concluded that the flux tube has a y - shape , at least at large distances .    in this paper",
    ", we study the flux tube profile in the baryonic system at finite temperature in qcd with dynamical fermions . the structure of the flux tube is investigated with the help of abelian observables after the maximally abelian gauge is fixed . in particular , we study the monopole and the photon parts of abelian flux tube profiles . in our previous study of the baryonic flux tube at zero temperature in both su(3 ) gluodynamics and qcd with dynamical quarks",
    "@xcite it has been demonstrated with an accuracy unmatched by gauge invariant nonabelian observables that the flux tube is of y - shape .",
    "the abelian and the monopole dominance phenomena well established in the gluodynamics @xcite and in qcd with dynamical quarks @xcite gives confidence that our results provide a qualitatively correct description of the baryonic flux tube at finite temperature .",
    "our study is also important to check the dual superconductor scenario of confinement which predicts that the effective infrared theory of qcd should be a kind of the dual abelian higgs model .",
    "to study qcd with dynamical quarks we consider @xmath1 flavors of degenerate quarks , using the wilson gauge field action and non - perturbatively @xmath2 improved wilson fermions  @xcite .",
    "configurations are generated on the @xmath3 lattice at @xmath4 , @xmath5 , corresponding to temperatures below and above the finite temperature transition at @xmath6 ( @xmath7  mev )  @xcite .",
    "details of the simulation can be found in  @xcite .",
    "we fixed the maximally abelian ( ma ) gauge on generated configurations employing the simulated annealing algorithm @xcite .",
    "the abelian projection procedure @xcite defines the diagonal link matrices",
    "@xmath8 @xmath9    we study the abelian action density @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the abelian plaquette variable , the abelian color electric field @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the regular part of the abelian plaquette angle , @xmath14 , and the monopole current @xmath15 correlators with the baryonic source are defined as follows : @xmath16 where @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22    .",

    "first we discuss the structure of the baryonic flux tube in the confinement phase .",
    "fig.[fig : profile_e.eps ] shows the monopole and photon parts of the color electric field in the 3q system .",
    "the monopole part is squeezed into a flux tube while the photon part is of coulombic form . in the monopole component",
    "the flux tube is compatible with y - shape .",
    "we expect that the agreement with y - shape will be better when the distance between quarks will be large in comparison with the intrinsic width of the flux tube .",
    "._,width=302 ]    _ , width=264 ]    [ fig : profile_b.eps ]    the same conclusions can be drawn from the fig.[fig : profile_s.eps ] where the distribution of the monopole and photon parts of the action density is depicted .",
    "fig.[fig : profile_b.eps ] shows the monopole currents distribution .",
    "one can see circulating monopole currents around the color electric field in each slice . in the plane",
    "where the color electric field is divided into two parts , the circulating monopole current is not a perfect circle anymore .",
    "this indicates a possibility of forming two circulating currents if the distance between quarks would be made larger .",
    "next , we show how the profile of the flux tube changes when the temperature increases and crosses over to the high temperature phase . from fig.[fig : profile_pt.eps ] one can see that the squeezed color electric field ( the monopole component ) disappear at @xmath23 .",
    "in contrast , the photon component of the color electric field , depicted in fig.[fig : profile_e.eps](right ) , does not show any essential changes when the temperature increases .",
