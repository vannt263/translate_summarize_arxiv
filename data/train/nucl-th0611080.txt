    "various meson production reactions in nuclei are a rich source of our understanding of hadronic interactions . in particular , interactions involving hyperons have to be explored by strangeness exchange reactions , since hyperons are absent in ordinary nuclear systems . naturally , the absence itself is a consequence of the properties of strange hadrons .",
    "the interaction between the lambda hyperon and the nucleon is fairly well known , since the experimental data for @xmath5 hypernuclei has been accumulated in last more than 30 years .",
    "the @xmath7-@xmath8 and @xmath9-@xmath8 interactions , by contrast , have not been well understood .",
    "even the sign of the @xmath7 single - particle ( s.p . ) potential in nuclear medium , which reflects basic properties of the @xmath7-@xmath8 interaction , has not been established .",
    "interactions among hyperons are far less investigated , except for the @xmath10 case .    in recent years",
    ", much experimental effort has been directed to the study of strange baryons and baryonic resonances in nuclear medium , using incident @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 beams with the energy of 1 @xmath14 2 gev .",
    "the extraction of meaningful understanding of these baryon properties from such reaction processes is not so simple , however . for analyzing experimental data",
    "we need to take into account various effects , such as the proper treatment of projectiles and outgoing hadrons , the model description of elementary processes in nuclei and the decent description of the target nucleus and the residual ( hyper ) nucleus .",
    "we also have to keep in mind the possibility of the change of properties of the relevant hadrons themselves in nuclear medium .",
    "since fully microscopic description is far from practical , various approximations are commonly introduced to analyze the experimental data .",
    "then , it is important to employ a model as simple and reliable as possible , bearing in mind that lack of some proper treatment can easily lead to misunderstanding of the basic hadron properties .",
    "@xmath7 formation spectra in @xmath15 and @xmath16 reactions with nuclei are not expected to have narrow peaks , because of the strong @xmath17 coupling . in spite of this , however , the early @xmath16 experimental spectra @xcite were interpreted as indicating an attractive @xmath7 s.p .",

    "the experimental discovery of 4s @xcite has shown that the @xmath7-@xmath8 interaction in the @xmath18 channel is sufficiently attractive to support the bound state in this specific nucleus , as discussed by harada @xcite .",
    "it has been recognized , however , that due to the strong repulsion in the isospin @xmath19 channel , @xmath7 bound states are unlikely to be observed in heavier nuclei .",
    "this conjecture was supported by experimental results on targets of @xmath20li and @xmath21be measured at bnl @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath16 spectra on @xmath21be from bnl @xcite given by dabrowski @xcite in a plane wave impulse approximation method suggested that the @xmath7 potential is repulsive of the order of 20 mev .",
    "the shift and the width of @xmath6 atomic states are another source of the information on the @xmath7-nucleus potential .",
    "batty , friedman and gal @xcite reexamined the @xmath6 atomic data and concluded that the @xmath7 potential should be attractive at the surface region but changes its sign to become repulsive at the higher density region in a nucleus .",
    "theoretical studies for the two - body @xmath7-@xmath8 force have also been inconclusive . in the 1970s ,",
    "the nijmegen group started to construct hard - core hyperon - nucleon potentials in a one - boson exchange model .",
    "parameter sets corresponding to two typical choices of the su(3 ) mixing angles were named as models d and f @xcite . the @xmath22-matrix calculation by yamamoto and bando in ref .",
    "@xcite showed that the model d yields @xmath23 mev for the @xmath7 potential in nuclear matter at the normal density ( @xmath24 @xmath25 ) and the model f repulsive 5.8 mev , though the explicit numbers vary in a different calculational scheme .",

    "a different approach using a non - relativistic su(6 ) quark model has been developed by the kyoto - niigata group @xcite to obtain a unified description of octet baryon - baryon interactions . in this model , the description of the short - ranged part of baryon - baryon interactions basically provided by the resonating - group method with the spin - flavor su(6 ) quark model wave functions and the one - gluon exchange fermi - breit interaction is supplemented by effective meson - exchange potentials acting between quarks .",
    "this model has little ambiguities in the hyperon - nucleon sector after the nucleon - nucleon interaction is determined .",
    "@xmath22 matrix calculations in the lowest order brueckner theory @xcite with the potential named as fss @xcite show that the @xmath7 s.p .",
    "potential in symmetric nuclear matter is repulsive of the order of 20 mev at normal density .",
    "the repulsion due to a strongly repulsive character in the isospin @xmath28 @xmath29 channel originating from quark pauli effects overcomes an attractive contribution in the @xmath18 @xmath29 channel which is similar to that in the @xmath30 case .",
    "the latest version of this quark model potential , fss2 @xcite , gives a smaller repulsion of about 8 mev in symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "we briefly mention relativistic mean filed model description for the hyperon sector .",
    "this model does not seem to have much predictive power , but once parameters are determined to fit basic properties it has wide applicability , for example , to a variety of neutron star matter calculations .",
    "in early models including only @xmath31 meson , the @xmath7 hyperon is predicted to have the similar attractive potential to the @xmath5 in nuclear medium .",
    "having recognized that the @xmath7 s.p .",
    "potential may be repulsive in nuclei , the model was extended to include @xmath32 meson to account for that property .",
    "the repulsion of 30 mev has been tentatively used in literature @xcite , although this specific number did not have a solid basis .",
    "it is also noted that kaiser @xcite calculated the @xmath7 mean - field in symmetric nuclear matter in the framework of su(3 ) chiral perturbation theory and found a moderately repulsive potential , that is , 59 mev for the real part and -21.5 mev for the imaginary one at normal density .",
    "recently , inclusive @xmath0 spectra corresponding to @xmath7 formation were measured at kek @xcite with better accuracy than before , using the pion beam with the momentum of @xmath33 gev / c on medium - to heavy nuclear targets .",
    "dwia analyses in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath3si and similar analyses later on other nuclear targets @xcite gave a notable conclusion that the @xmath7 potential is strongly repulsive , as large as 100 mev .",
    "harada and hirabayashi @xcite showed in similar calculations with their optimal fermi - averaging for the elementary @xmath34-matrix that the @xmath7 potential is repulsive inside the nuclear surface , though the actual strength varies with the imaginary part supposed .",
    "the determination of the @xmath7-@xmath8 interaction is of fundamental importance in the study of such problems as those of neutron star matter and heavy ion collisions , because the baryonic component of such hadronic matter , especially the hyperon admixture , is governed by the basic baryon - baryon interactions . considering the importance of determining the @xmath7-@xmath8 interaction on the basis of experimental data , it is desirable to analyze the kek experiments in a different and independent calculational scheme from those in refs .",

    "iv : first for the @xmath5 formation to see the applicability of the scdw model and next for the @xmath7 formation .",
    "the latter case is the main concern of the present paper to obtain more solid information about the strength of the @xmath7 single - particle potential than before . in this paper",

    "conclusions are given in sec .",
    "v , with the outlook of the future extension of our model .",
    "the starting formula for the double differential cross section in a standard distorted wave model description of the @xmath38 hyperon ( @xmath40 ) production inclusive reaction is expressed as    @xmath41    where @xmath42 and @xmath43 represent the incident pion and final kaon wave functions with energies @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively , and @xmath46 is the energy transfer .",
    "the formula describes the process in which the nucleon in the occupied single - particle state @xmath47 is converted to the unobserved outgoing hyperon ( @xmath5 or @xmath7 ) state @xmath48 .",
    "the elementary amplitude of the process @xmath49 is denoted by @xmath50 , which depends on the energy and momentum of the particles in the reaction . in order to treat such dependence ,",
    "it is necessary to introduce momentum space integration . in that case , the explicit calculations involve higher - dimensional integrations .",
    "it is desirable , in practice , to develop a tractable and trustful approximation method .",
    "one procedure that has been frequently used is the factorization approximation , in which the elementary process is taken out of the integration , assuming some averaging wisdom . as used in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath51 , the elementary amplitude in the integrand may be replaced by the averaged differential cross section over the nucleon momentum distribution @xmath52 , @xmath53 with @xmath54 , and is taken outside of the integration .",
    "the remaining quantity is the green function , which is not difficult to evaluate in the case of a local optical potential .",
    "a more sophisticated fermi - averaging method was used in ref . @xcite .",
    "though such procedure has been widely applied to show various successes , the justification is far from trivial .",
    "important dynamical effects might be hidden in the averaging treatment .      in ref .",
    "@xcite , we presented our scdw approximation method for the dwia cross section formula , eq .",
    "( 1 ) . there",
    ", we introduced a local fermi gas approximation for the target nucleus . in this paper , we improve the description by explicitly treating s.p .",
    "wave functions of the target nucleus .",
    "the semiclassical treatment was first introduced in the description of the intermediate energy nucleon reactions on nuclei @xcite .",
    "since the amount of numerical calculations is reduced , it becomes feasible to include and assess multi - step contributions .",
    "the calculations of @xmath55 and @xmath37 inclusive spectra have shown that the scdw method works well .",
    "the semiclassical approximation employs the following idea for the propagation of the wave function . denoting the midpoint and the relative coordinates of @xmath56 and @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) by @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively , we assume that the propagation of the distorted waves , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , from @xmath62 to @xmath56 or @xmath57 is described by a plane wave with the local classical momentum @xmath63 at the position @xmath62 . @xmath64",
    "the local momentum @xmath63 is defined as follows .",
    "the direction is specified by the quantum mechanical momentum density @xmath65 calculated by @xmath66 where @xmath67 represents taking the real part , and the magnitude is determined by the energy - momentum relation @xmath68 at @xmath62 .",
    "here , @xmath69 is the real part of an optical potential for the distorted wave function @xmath70 with energy @xmath71 .",
    "the relativistic energy - momentum relation is used for the distorted wave function described by the klein - gordon equation .",
    "the above approximation is expected to work well if the dominant contributions in the integration over @xmath56 and @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is restricted in the region where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are close to each other .",
    "actually , the density matrix @xmath72 brings about this desirable feature , as is shown in the following heuristic argument .",
    "it is sufficient for the qualitative discussion to assume that nuclear s.p .",
    "wave functions are harmonic oscillator ones .",
    "the summation over the @xmath73-component of the angular momentum of each orbit means that we are treating two oscillator functions coupled to the total angular momentum @xmath74 ; @xmath75 the transformation to the @xmath62 and @xmath76 coordinates are carried out using the talmi - moshinsky brackets .",
    "@xmath77 the reaction processes which we consider take place mostly at the surface of the target nucleus .",
    "when @xmath62 is located in the surface region , the dominant components in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( 7 ) are those in which @xmath78 is the largest .",
    "this indicates that the dependence on the relative coordinate @xmath76 is governed by the @xmath79 ( @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) function , which is certainly short - ranged compared with the size of the target nucleus .",
    "thus we expect that the scdw treatment of eqs .",
    "( 3,4 ) in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is meaningful .",
    "note that since the scdw approximation should be exact in homogeneous matter , the scdw works well inside of the nucleus .",
    "the above reasoning implies that the scdw approximation is also applicable to the surface region .",
    "this fact is probably connected to the fact that the local density approximation based on the density matrix expansion method @xcite works well in nuclear structure calculations , including the surface region .      in the preparatory calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite , we introduced a thomas - fermi approximation for the density matrix @xmath82 of the target nucleus . here , we elaborate the description of the density matrix by using a wigner transformation .",
    "the wigner transformation of the density matrix of the target nuclear wave function is defined as @xmath83 @xmath84 is given by the inverse transformation as @xmath85 the summation over the @xmath73-component of the angular momentum is implicit in these expressions . as is shown in the appendix ,",
    "@xmath86 may be expressed in terms of the legendre expansion : @xmath87 where @xmath88 denotes the angle between two vectors @xmath89 and @xmath62 .",
    "it is easy to see that the thomas - fermi approximation for the density matrix used in ref .",
    "@xcite amounts to the replacement @xmath90 where @xmath91 is a step function and @xmath92^{1/3}$ ] is a local fermi momentum determined by the local proton or neutron density @xmath93 at @xmath94 .",
    "we describe unobserved hyperons by a local optical potential .",
    "actually , the hyperon optical potential should be complex , because there are inelastic processes .",
    "the standard way to treat the completeness of the final states described by a complex hamiltonian is to use the green function method @xcite . at this stage , however , we adopt a simplified prescription , employing a real potential of the standard woods - saxon form , @xmath95 and we convolute the result of the calculated spectrum with a lorentz - type distribution function with the typical width , simulating the effects of inelastic channels . in that case , the expression of eq .",
    "( 1 ) is directly used .",
    "then , we introduce the scdw approximation as in eqs .",
    "( 3,4 ) also for the hyperon wave functions @xmath96 and @xmath97 .    using these approximations explained above , the double differential cross section in the scdw model becomes    @xmath98    the summation @xmath99 means the sum over the spin and the momentum of the outgoing unobserved hyperon : @xmath100 .",
    "if we use the energy , instead of the momentum , to specify scattering states , the momentum integration @xmath101 is written as follows : @xmath102    the above final expression ( [ eqscdw ] ) admits of the simple interpretation that the reaction in which @xmath103 yields @xmath104 takes place at the position @xmath62 and satisfies conservation of local semiclassical momentum : @xmath105 these momenta , @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 , are calculated with eq .",

    "it is seen that the dimension of the integration does not change from eq .",
    "( 1 ) to eq . ( [ eqscdw ] ) .",
    "however , we can now treat the momentum dependence of the transition amplitude @xmath50 explicitly .    in the present formulation , the correction for the lack of the translational invariance @xcite in the target nuclear wave function is not included . in describing electron scattering on a nucleus composed of @xmath109 nucleons , the center - of - mass effects @xcite in the nuclear shell model",
    "have been taken care of by a multiplicative factor @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the momentum transfer and @xmath112 is the oscillator constant . for @xmath113 and @xmath114 @xmath115 , the factor @xmath116 amounts to 1.5 when the momentum transfer is 2 @xmath25 .",
    "thus the calculation without the center - of - mass correction tends to underestimate the cross section .",
    "the appropriate treatment of the center - of - mass effects in our scdw method deserves to be studied in the future .",
    "the on - shell amplitude @xmath50 of the elementary process is related to the differential cross section by @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the invariant mass squared . in eq .",

    "the @xmath22-matrix calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite indicates that the repulsive strength is not energy - independent .",
    "because of the strong repulsive contribution from the isospin @xmath28 channel , it is hypothesized that the @xmath6-nucleus potential becomes more repulsive in the case of a neutron excess . in this respect",
    ", analyses of the @xmath0 data with heavier nucleus targets will be interesting for the purpose of investigating whether such quantitative isospin dependence actually exists .    in the present calculations ,",
    "there are various treatments to be improved .",
    "the smearing caused by the lorentz - type convolution should be treated by the precise way of the green s function method , though much calculational efforts have to be devoted .",
    "a quantitative estimation of the contribution from multi - step processes is needed , which could fill the difference of the experimental data and the calculational results as is seen in the @xmath5 formation spectra .",
    "a model description of the elementary process is to be upgraded , though new experimental data is required to do it . after improving these points and the proper account of the cm motion of the target wave function",
    ", the scdw framework serves as a quantitatively reliable model to study the possible modification of the elementary amplitudes in nuclear medium .",
    "the direction of the change of cross sections , increase or decrease , depends on how the amplitudes are altered through the underlying dynamical processes .",
    "we have developed a semiclassical distorted wave model for @xmath166 inclusive spectra corresponding to @xmath5 and @xmath7 formation processes , using the wigner transformation of the nuclear density matrix .",
    "the expression of the double differential cross section consists of the incoming pion distorted wave function , the outgoing kaon distorted wave function and the undetected hyperon distorted wave function at each collision point , where the conservation of the classical local momenta is respected .",
    "the momentum distribution of the bound nucleon in the target nucleus is obtained from the wigner transformation of hartree - fock wave functions .",
    "we have first applied the model to inclusive @xmath167 @xmath5 formation spectra on the @xmath3si and @xmath2c targets measured at kek @xcite . in this case , since the @xmath5 s.p .",

    "the standard @xmath5 potential strength is found to reproduce well overall energy dependence of the data .",
    "the strength is underestimated .",
    "however , this is a rather preferable result , because the proper treatment of the cm motion has to be implemented in our scdw formulation and there should be some contributions from two - step processes which are not taken into account .",
    "the quantitative estimation of these effects is one of the important subjects to be investigated .    observing from the @xmath167 @xmath5 formation",
    "spectra that the scdw model provides a useful description of the inclusive spectrum without any adjustable parameters and renormalization factors , we have proceeded to the @xmath168 @xmath7 formation spectra .",

    "potential strength in a standard woods - saxon geometry with experimental data from kek @xcite has shown that an attractive @xmath7-nucleus potential overestimates the spectrum at lower excitation energies .",
    "although there are rather large uncertainties in the information of the elementary process , we see that the repulsive potential is necessary to account for the absolute strength of the spectrum .",
    "although we have to await quantitative estimation of various effects above mentioned to specify the strength of the @xmath7-nucleus potential , it is reasonable to conclude that the @xmath7 hyperon experiences repulsion in nuclear medium and its magnitude is not so strong as around 100 mev which was suggested by dwia analyses in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the information about the repulsive feature of the @xmath7-nucleus potential constrains the two - body @xmath7-@xmath8 potential model and thereby improves our understanding of the interactions between octet baryons . in the literature",
    "there has been a few @xmath7-@xmath8 potential models which predict repulsive @xmath7 mean field . in nijmegen models",
    "@xcite , only the model f is satisfactory in this respect .",
    "another model is a su(6 ) quark model by the kyoto - niigata group @xcite .",
    "the model fss gives 20 mev @xcite , on the other hand the more sophisticated version fss2 predicts somewhat smaller repulsion of 8 mev .",
    "more studies are certainly needed to determine the strength of the @xmath7 s.p .",
    "potential , by employing various choice of the potential shapes .",
    "the energy dependence of the @xmath7-nucleus potential may also have to be taken into consideration .",
    "the analyses of the data of heavier target nuclei are important in the next step .",
    "since the neutron excess means that the @xmath28 contribution becomes larger , we could check the isospin dependence of the @xmath7-@xmath8 interaction on the basis of experimental data .",
    "the scdw analyses of the data on @xmath169ni , @xmath170 in and @xmath171bi taken at kek @xcite are in progress .",
