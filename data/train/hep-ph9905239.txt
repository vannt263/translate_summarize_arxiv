    "therefore , the rate in the high temperature phase , the so - called hot sphaleron rate , can not be computed using weak coupling methods .    close to thermal equilibrium , the rate for topology changing transitions can be written in terms of a different - time correlation function of the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the average over a thermal ensemble @xcite .",
