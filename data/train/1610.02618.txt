    "enormous neutrino oscillation experiments in the last two decades have provided definite evidence for non - zero neutrino masses and the mixing between different flavors  @xcite .",
    "this becomes the first hint that the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics must be extended .",
    "meanwhile , the higgs boson is the last building block of sm and its discovery has significantly improved our knowledge over spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "however , the origin of neutrino mass as one of the motivations to go beyond it , remains an open question .",
    "the neutrino could have a dirac mass through yukawa mechanism like other sm fermions .",
    "but , first of all , the hierarchy in @xmath3 at @xmath4 is quite unnatural .",
    "a second argument arises from the prediction of electric charge quantization .",
    "the bound on neutrino electric charge @xmath5 is @xmath6(68% cl , @xmath7 is the magnitude of the electronic charge ) by assuming charge conservation in @xmath8-decay @xmath9  @xcite , and @xmath10 from sn1987a astrophysics observation  @xcite .",
    "anomaly - free conditions determine @xmath11 as the unique @xmath0 gauge symmetry in sm up to a normalization factor  @xcite .",
    "though extending sm with milli - charged dirac neutrino does not explicitly violate the anomaly - free conditions , the hyper - charge assignment is no longer unique unless the neutrino is a majorana particle  @xcite .",
    "these motivate the study of majorana neutrinos .    taking the effective theory approach ,",
    "majorana neutrino mass term is from the non - renormalizable weinberg operator @xmath12  @xcite where @xmath13 is dimensionless .",
    "this dimension - five operator breaks @xmath14 lepton number by two units(@xmath15 ) , indicating new physics comes in at @xmath16 scale .",
    "being remanent of the global chiral symmetry , lepton number and baryon number arise as accidental symmetries which would be violated by non - perturbative gravitational effects at the planck s scale @xmath17 . however , if one identify @xmath17 as the @xmath16 scale , the neutrino mass is only of order @xmath18  ev , which is much too small to explain for the observed oscillation phenomenon .",
    "another possibility is that @xmath19(ev ) neutrino mass is a consequence of @xmath20 suppression since the grand unification theory(gut ) scale is several orders lower than @xmath17 .",
    "the simplest realization is the so - called type - i  see - saw \" mechanism where a sm singlet neutrino @xmath21 forms dirac mass term with lepton @xmath22 doublet as @xmath23 and a majorana mass term by itself @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "the lighter mass eigenstates are then identified as the light neutrinos and the heavy ones with mass @xmath25 are still in search .",
    "the sm singlet @xmath21 can be accommodated in the spinor representation of @xmath26 gut group as @xmath27 . in such gut - models",
    ", @xmath28 spontaneously breaks the @xmath29 gauge symmetry .",
    "further possibility exists in extended models where a higher - dimensional weinberg operator @xmath30\\ell_{i}\\ell_{j}\\phi\\phi$ ] allows more freedom in choosing @xmath31 scale and @xmath32 coefficient for correct neutrino mass .",
    "neutrionless double beta decay ( @xmath1 ) is the most important experiment to test such @xmath15 process .",
    "so far there s no @xmath1 signal observed by gerda and kamland - zen collaborations , which put lower half - life limits on @xmath33 and @xmath34 isotopes  @xcite .",
    "these results provide the strongest bound on the mixing @xmath35 between electron and heavy majorana neutrinos as @xmath36-@xmath37 for a wide @xmath25 window ranging from @xmath38 mev to @xmath39 gev .",
    "however , the existence of majorana @xmath40 phases could cause cancellation between amplitudes in @xmath1 process and this significantly weaken the exclusion limits when there re more than two sterile majorana neutrino flavors  @xcite .",
    "there are also direct or indirect searching experiments that put constraints on the mixings at different @xmath25 regions from ev to tev@xcite .",
    "related phenomenological analysis could be found in  @xcite .",
    "the direct production of heavy neutrino on colliders makes the searches possible in both precision frontier and energy frontier .",
    "experiments with abundant mesons could probe mass region smaller than meson masses in process @xmath41 .",
    "the decay branching ratio is proportional to the mixing @xmath42 and the lepton energy spectrum deviates from the usual case with light active neutrinos . if the heavy neutrinos are majorana particles , their lnv decays into same - sign leptons could further be detected . in lhcb and belle experiments where precise measurement of @xmath43-meson decay is available , constrains on the mixing @xmath42 from lnv decay search",
    "is around @xmath44 when @xmath45 is close to @xmath46@xcite . in the case",
    "when @xmath25 is smaller than @xmath47 , the so - called beam dump search experiments could detect the decay final states of those @xmath48 coming from @xmath49-mesons .",
    "the charm and nutev experiments each could push the upper limit of @xmath50 and @xmath51 down to below @xmath37 while the ps191 and e949 bounds in the region below @xmath52  mev are even stronger@xcite .",
    "the most severe bound in this region is close to @xmath53 when @xmath45 is around @xmath54  mev .",
    "the @xmath55 peak search , for example in the @xmath56@xcite and @xmath57@xcite processes , could be used in the very small mass region below that .",
    "collider experiments at the energy frontier could also probe the heavy majorana particles .",
    "the delphi experiment at lep put upper limit to @xmath58 decay branching ratio for @xmath25 between @xmath59 and @xmath60  gev through the measurement of z decay and @xmath61 upper abound is set at @xmath62(@xmath18 )  @xcite .",

    "the smoking gun signature is same - sign dilepton plus jets with no @xmath63 .",
    "both the atlas@xcite and the cms@xcite collaborations have published the result with @xmath64  tev data for @xmath45 up to @xmath39  gev . however , this is still weaker than the electroweak precision observables ( ewpo ) bound , which is sensitive to the non - unitarity of leptonic mixing matrix @xcite _",
    "i |v_ei|^2|v_e|^2_ew = 2.110 ^ -3 .",
    "[ ewpobound ]    recently , several future electron - positron colliders have been proposed for precise higgs measurement .",
    "such machine may enable the inverse @xmath1 process as @xmath65 ( fig.[eeww ] ) to probe majorana neutrino .",
    "this could become an alternative and complementary experiment to the conventional @xmath1 because the energy scales are different .",
    "previous studies in related topics could be found in  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the collider phenomenology and searching strategies of @xmath66 .",
    "the @xmath66 scattering could be measured in three decay modes as pure leptonic , semi - leptonic and pure hadronic . in the following",
    ", we will first discuss the kinematic features of each modes for experimental measurements .    in the pure leptonic mode , the two final state leptons always move back - to - back with each other as @xmath67 is from a spin - zero system and only left - handed electrons take part in the weak interaction .",
    "this leads to an angular - distribution which peaks at @xmath68 .",
    "the @xmath69 cut could be applied to distinguish signals from backgrounds .    on the other hand ,",
    "the two invisible neutrino final states make it impossible to reconstruct the two @xmath70 bosons with @xmath71 information .",
    "@xmath72 method could be used here by defining a minimization of all possible matches of @xmath73 and @xmath74 variables as  @xcite m_t2 ^ 2__1+_2=_t where @xmath75 is the missing transverse momentum and @xmath76 is the reconstructed transverse mass .",
    "the @xmath72 variable has an upper bound at @xmath77 and the corresponding @xmath78 could be used in reconstructing the system invariant - mass , whose distribution is around @xmath79 in signal events .",
    "moreover , if the electron collider could be upgraded to a few - tev machine , the distinct boosted properties of final states allow us more kinematic handles on data sample reconstruction .",
    "we thus treat the highly boosted leptons and neutrinos from a same @xmath70 boson as they re approximately collinear .",
    "then the approximate relation @xmath80 could be used to solve for the two neutrinos as = if all the final states are obtained in this approximation , the invariant - mass cut could still be applied .",
    "the semi - leptonic decay has larger signal production cross - section than the pure leptonic mode and it s more reconstructable . since the two beams are symmetric , the momentum of the only neutrino is just @xmath81 the two on - shell @xmath70 bosons could be reconstructed either with a proper pair of jets or with the lepton and neutrino .    in the hadronic mode with multi - jet final states , the @xmath70 bosons could be reconstructed with proper choices of jet - pairs and the invariant - mass of the two pairs of jets is to be compared with @xmath79 for event selection . if the collision is energetic enough , the boost effect could be prominent as two jets from a boosted @xmath70 would form a fat @xmath70-jet(@xmath82 ) with jet mass around @xmath83  gev .",
    "the appearance of two @xmath70-jets is a key feature of hadronic decay at high collision energy .    the backgrounds of this process and the decay channels they contribute to are listed in table.[bkgtable ] below .",
    "we include processes with extra electrons because of the abundance of background electrons on this @xmath84-collider .",
    "these extra electrons could fake @xmath63 if they are not really detected , especially in the effective gauge - boson approximation and vector boson fusion process .",
    "the radiated photons from leptons are also taken into consideration because the cross - section could be comparable with other channels . its contribution is calculated in the effective photon approximation with the improved weizsaecker - williams formula@xcite .",
    ".backgrounds of inverse @xmath1 process and the decay channels [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it s apparent that for the channels with more signal events survived than backgrounds , the detection is purely through event counting . in order to get the @xmath85 excess significance in the rest channels , the @xmath86  tev pure leptonic decay with @xmath87 , @xmath86  tev semi - leptonic decay with @xmath88 and @xmath39  gev hadronic decay require about @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 data samples respectively .    in fig.[signal-5sigma-4j ]",
    ", we show the comparision of @xmath92 exclusion limit in the pure hadronic decay mode with the ewpo bound .",
    "we assume the luminosity could reach @xmath93 . in the @xmath94gev case ,",
