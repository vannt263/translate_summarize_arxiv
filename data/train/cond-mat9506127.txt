    "the eliashberg equation is usually solved in the limit of an infinite electronic bandwidth , @xmath7 , and fermi energy , @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9 limit may be justified in the conventional superconductors where the fermi energy is much larger than the characteristic phonon frequency , @xmath10 .",
    "the superconducting pairing occurs mainly within a region of width @xmath10 around the fermi surface , and for @xmath11 , it makes no difference whether we take @xmath8 finite or infinite .",
    "there are , however , superconducting materials where @xmath8 is comparable with @xmath10 : for fullerene superconductors , @xmath12 ev , @xmath13 ev , and @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , of great interest to study how the superconducting properties are modified as the bandwidth and fermi energy are reduced .",
    "this is an important as well as difficult problem which concomitantly calls for a reinvestigation of the migdal theorem and coulomb pseudopotential @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the migdal theorem ensures that the phonon vertex corrections are smaller than those terms included in the theory of superconductivity by the factor of @xmath16 , hence may be neglected for conventional low temperature superconductors with @xmath11 .",
    "the coulomb repulsion , @xmath17 , is reduced to @xmath18 \\approx 0.1 \\-- 0.2 $ ] , owing to the retardation effect . if @xmath14 , however , then the phonon vertex correction should be important , and the coulomb repulsion will not be reduced , @xmath19 , which will almost always kill superconductivity .",
    "we will not , however , try to investigate these complications in this paper .",
    "we will instead assume that superconductivity results within the framework of eliashberg theory , and will investigate how the strong - coupling eliashberg theory is modified due to a finite bandwidth and what the consequences are of the modification .",
    "this problem was first treated by zheng and bennemann @xcite in the context of fullerene superconductors , who calculated the pressure dependence of the transition temperature , @xmath0 , for doped fullerenes within the strong - coupling eliashberg formalism .",
    "their calculations with the finite bandwidth explicitly included agree well with the experimental observations . in the different context of a @xmath20-@xmath21 superconductivity ,",
    "marsiglio @xcite investigated the dependence of @xmath0 on nonmagnetic and magnetic impurities including the effects of a finite bandwidth .",
    "he found that the nonmagnetic impurities reduce @xmath0 for finite @xmath7 .",
    "this is interesting in view of the recent debate over the abrikosov and gorkov ( ag ) theory of impure superconductors @xcite .",
    "kim and overhauser @xcite pointed out that the ag theory , if evaluated literally within the @xmath20-@xmath22 weak - coupling bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) framework @xcite , implies a substantial reduction of @xmath0 by nonmagnetic impurities in an apparent contradiction to the anderson s theorem @xcite and to experimental observations on conventional low temperature superconductors @xcite .",
    "it is now understood that the ag theory is in accord with the anderson s theorem if treated within the eliashberg theory taking fully into account the @xmath22 nature of a pairing interaction , whereas the criticism by kim and overhauser should be valid for a non - retarded pairing interaction @xcite .",
    "the problem of retardedness is directly related with a cutoff in the frequency or momentum summation . by working with a more realistic finite bandwidth eliashberg theory , with cutoffs both in the frequency and momentum summations",
    ", we will be able to understand the recent controversy on the ag theory more clearly as will be discussed later .    in the ag theory of impure superconductors of infinite bandwidths ,",
    "the thermodynamic properties are independent of the impurity scattering rates because there exists a scaling relation between pure and impure superconductivity @xcite .",
    "this simple relation , however , breaks down if finite bandwidths are taken into consideration as will be discussed below .",
    "therefore , the thermodynamic properties of dirty superconductors are no longer independent of impurity scattering rates when the finite bandwidths are explicitly taken into account .",
    "two of the thermodynamic properties , transition temperature , @xmath0 , and nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate , @xmath23 , are studied in this paper within the phonon - mediated eliashberg theory .",
    "when an electronic bandwidth is finite , @xmath0 is suppressed as impurity scattering rate , @xmath24 , is increased .",
    "the rate of @xmath0 suppression by impurities is determined by the electronic bandwidth and strength of electron - phonon coupling , and in the limit of @xmath9 , @xmath0 is independent of impurity scattering rate in agreement with the anderson s theorem .",
    "the impurity suppression of @xmath0 is @xmath25 a consequence of a time reversal symmetry breaking , but follows dynamically from the modified eliashberg equation of a finite electronic bandwidth , as is reflected in the fact that nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath23 is rather enhanced by the impurity scatterings . as the electronic bandwidth",
    "is reduced , the available electronic states to and from which quasi - particles can be scattered are restricted , and the effective electron - phonon coupling constant , @xmath1 , consequently , is decreased .",
    "the reduced @xmath1 implies decreased @xmath0 and enhanced nmr coherence peak in @xmath26 .",
    "there are several factors that affect the nmr coherence peak of @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the suppression of nmr coherence peak may be attributed to ( a ) gap anisotropy / non @xmath28-wave pairing of superconducting phase @xcite , ( b ) strong - coupling phonon damping @xcite , ( c ) paramagnetic impurities in samples @xcite , and/or ( d ) strong coulomb interaction @xcite such as paramagnon / antiparamagnon effects @xcite .",
    "the nonmagnetic impurity scatterings , on the other hand , have no influence on @xmath27 for conventional superconductors of infinite bandwidth @xcite , other than the smearing of gap anisotropy .",
    "this is because ( a ) there exists a simple scaling relation between the gap and renormalization functions of pure and impure superconductors of infinite bandwidth , and ( b ) in the expression for @xmath27 , the numerator and denominator are of the same powers in renormalization function , as will be detailed below .",
    "we found that @xmath0 is reduced and the nmr coherence peak is enhanced as @xmath24 is increased for a finite bandwidth , because the effective @xmath1 is reduced .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the previous study of paramagnetic transition metals by macdonald @xcite . in considering the effects of a finite bandwidth of the @xmath29 electrons on the mass enhancement ,",
    "macdonald found the reduced bandwidths cause a reduction in the mass enhancement due to electron - paramagnon interaction .",
    "the reduced @xmath30 means reduced @xmath1 in agreement with the present work .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we will present the eliashberg equation on imaginary frequencies for impure superconductors with finite bandwidths . within the formalism",
    ", we will also discuss the anderson s theorem including the scaling relation between the pure and impure superconductivity .",
    "we can solve the eliashberg equation either in the imaginary frequency to obtain the gap function , @xmath31 , and renormalization function , @xmath32 , or in the real frequency to obtain @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "it is , however , much easier to solve the eliashberg equation in the imaginary frequency .",
    "we therefore carried out the @xmath0 calculations in the imaginary frequencies .",
    "detailed numerical calculations of as well as qualitative discussions on @xmath0 will be presented in detail in sec .",
    "a brief comment on the theory of @xmath0 of impure superconductivity will be made in view of recent debates on the topic . for calculating @xmath6 , we need @xmath33 and @xmath34 in real frequencies .",
    "it is more efficient to solve the eliashberg equation in the imaginary frequency and perform analytic continuations to real frequency than to solve it in real frequency . using the iterative method for analytic continuations @xcite extended to finite bandwidths",
    ", we calculate the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rates @xmath6 as the bandwidths , electron - phonon couplings and impurity scattering rates are varied .",
    "the results of these calculations will be presented in sec .",
    "finally , we will summarize our results and give some concluding remarks in sec . v.",
    "the electron - phonon interaction is local in space and retarded in time .",
    "consequently , it s momentum dependence is weak and neglected in the isotropic eliashberg equation , but the frequency dependence is important and fully included .",
    "the isotropic eliashberg equation in the imaginary frequency including the finite electronic bandwidth and impurity scatterings on an equal footing is written as @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 here , @xmath37 is the density of states at the fermi level , @xmath38 s the pauli matrices operating in the nambu space , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the matsubara frequency given by @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath17 is the chemical potential , which should not be confused with the coulomb repulsion .",
