    "to describe the flow of an isotropic and compressible newtonian fluid on a continuum level , it is necessary to have precise values of both shear viscosity @xmath0 and bulk viscosity @xmath1 . in a newtonian fluid",
    ", the shear viscosity @xmath0 relates a shear flow @xmath2 to the off - diagonal component @xmath3 of the stress tensor and is thus a measure for the resistance of a fluid element against _ deformation of shape_. similarly , the bulk viscosity @xmath1 relates a divergence in the flow field @xmath4 to the trace of the stress tensor @xmath5 and is thus a measure for the resistance of a fluid element against _ deformation of volume_. for many flows only shear viscosity is of interest .",
    "however , bulk viscosity can play an important role for the brownian motion of a large particle ( e.g. a colloid ) or especially for shock wave problems ( e.g. damping of a sound wave ) .",
    "in fact shockwave problems are exactly the systems chosen experimentally to determine the bulk viscosity @xcite .",
    "there exist two different ways to determine transport coefficients like shear and bulk viscosity of a fluid using molecular dynamics ( md ) .",
    "one can create a non - equilibrium state and calculate the transport coefficients using direct measurements ( force , stress or flow measurements ) @xcite .",
    "we will refer to this as non - equilibrium molecular dynamics ( nemd ) .",
    "alternatively , equilibrium fluctuations are evaluated to determine transport coefficients using green - kubo @xcite or einstein - helfand relations @xcite .    in nemd ,",
    "it is favorable to simulate a non - equilibrium steady - state with time - independent statistical properties .",
    "this is easily possible in the case of steady - state shear flow : one can use boundary - driven shear flow @xcite , lees - edwards boundary conditions @xcite , force - driven poiseuille flow @xcite or momentum interchange @xcite .",
    "all these methods have been used to determine the shear viscosity @xmath0 of fluids . however , creating a steady - state divergent flow field to measure the bulk viscosity @xmath6 is much more complicated .",
    "as mentioned above , the bulk viscosity is related to the deformation of the volume of a fluid element and thus to a change of the local thermodynamic state of the system .",
    "this is the reason why it is difficult to measure the bulk viscosity in a steady - state experiment @xcite . to the best knowledge of the authors , the only nemd calculations of the bulk viscosity use either cyclic compression @xcite or the relaxation of an instantaneous distortion @xcite .",
    "the methods used in these studies can not be applied to systems with stochastic dynamics  either because they are explicitly designed for hamiltonian systems @xcite , or , in the case of ref .",
    "@xcite , because they can not be used to determine the instantaneous contribution of the random force to the viscosity ( as already mentioned in @xcite ) due to the finite time step in md simulations .",
    "in addition to the above mentioned calculations , there have been extensive nemd studies of the elongationaly viscosity using the so called sllod equation of motion @xcite .",
    "this boundary - driven nemd method does not rely on a hamiltonian dynamics and it should be possible to generalize it to stochastic equations of motion",
    ". however , in order to calculate the bulk viscosity , it will be necessary to choose a vanishing strain rate in order to minimize the change of volume .",
    "therefore , all these methods depend on a perturbation parameter @xmath7 that has to be chosen very small to get reliable results , hence they can only be used in the linear response regime .    in that regime , using green - kubo or einstein - helfand relations is an attractive alternative to nemd methods .",
    "the great advantage is that one can evaluate transport coefficients without having to create a non - equilibrium state . in conservative systems ,",
    "both relations are well - understood and often used",
    ". however , the correct way to account for random and dissipative forces is less clear . in 1995",
    "espaol @xcite suggested a generic green - kubo form @xmath8 which depends on the conservative and dissipative projected momentum currents @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "`` generic '' means , that the equation is not restricted to a specific viscosity . in sec .",
    "[ green - kubo ] we will identify the projected momentum currents @xmath11 to find practical green - kubo relations for the shear viscosity @xmath0 and the bulk viscosity @xmath1 .",
    "the formula implies that the random force has no direct contribution and the total viscosity is just a summation of the conservative and the dissipative contribution .",
    "more recently , espaol and vzquez @xcite and later ernst and brito @xcite suggested another generic green - kubo form , @xmath12 where the instantaneous viscosity @xmath13 denotes a contribution of stochastic forces .",
    "the time evolution is defined by the pseuodstreaming operator @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( details in sec .",
    "[ green - kubo ] and ref .",
    "this expression explicitly accounts for the fact that the dissipative force is _ not invariant under time reversal symmetry_. to our best knowledge , none of these formulae have been verified by simulations in the presence of random and dissipative forces to this date .",
    "recently espaol @xcite also presented a generalized einstein - helfand form that can be used if the underlying dynamics is dissipative and stochastic .",
    "it could be shown that both relations should give the same result . in the present work we focus on generalized green - kubo expressions that have the useful advantage of separating the stochastic contribution and",
    "should therefore give better statistics .",
    "in the future , it will also be interesting to test einstein - helfand relations in the presence of stochastic and dissipative interactions .",
    "the purpose of the present work is two - fold .",
    "first , we propose two novel nemd techniques to measure the bulk viscosity @xmath16 from fluid simulations of steady - state systems with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "one , denoted  particle transfer method  , creates a divergent flow field by manually displacing particles .",
    "this method is most efficient in systems of particles interacting by soft potentials .",
    "the other , denoted  force driven method  , makes use of a spatially varying body force and a non - zero center of mass velocity and can be used in a wider range of molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "second , we test the green - kubo relations ( [ eq : espanol ] ) and ( [ eq : ernst ] ) using the example of a dissipative particle dynamics ( dpd ) fluid and compare the resulting values with the results from nemd simulations .    our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ nemd ] , we present our new nemd methods for determining bulk viscosities from fluid simulations . in sec .",
    "[ green - kubo ] , we briefly introduce the different green - kubo relations for the shear and bulk viscosity . in sec .",
    "[ results ] , we present simulation results for dpd fluids and compare the values of the viscosity parameters obtained with different methods .",
    "we summarize and conclude in sec .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "in this section we present the nemd methods for calculating viscosity parameters from fluid simulations .",
    "first we review the momentum interchange method to create a steady - state shear flow that was introduced by mller - plathe @xcite .",
    "then we introduce our novel techniques to create a steady - state divergence of the flow field .",
    "the last section explains how to evaluate the local stress tensor to determine precise values of the viscosities .",
    "the methods are illustrated by the example of dpd simulations of fluids _ without conservative interactions_.    in dpd the particles are interacting via dissipative and random pair forces , which are constructed in a way that the total momentum is conserved @xcite . both forces are connected via fluctuation dissipation theorems such that a proper canonical distribution is reached at equilibrium @xcite .",
    "therefore dpd is a galilean invariant thermostat and can be used to study hydrodynamics .",
    "in fact , marsh _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that dpd fulfills the hydrodynamic equations ( navier - stokes equation ) and calculated theoretical values for transport coefficients .",
    "the dpd equations of motion can be written as stochastic differential equations @xcite    @xmath17    with the velocity difference @xmath18 , the distance @xmath19 and the fluctuation dissipation theorems @xmath20 and @xmath21 .    in the present work ,",
    "we use the weight function @xmath22 .",
    "the simulation units are defined by setting @xmath23 ( energy ) , @xmath24 ( length ) and @xmath25 ( time ) . in these units ,",
    "we choose the dpd parameter @xmath26 and the time step @xmath27 .",
    "if a shear flow @xmath28 emerges in a fluid , it will be damped due to shear viscosity @xmath0 .",
    "this damping can be described by a momentum flux @xmath29 which transports momentum @xmath30 in @xmath31-direction . to maintain the shear flow",
    "it is therefore necessary to counteract the damping by enforcing a similar momentum flux in @xmath32-direction .",
    "momentum interchange method to generate steady - state shear flow .",
    "right panel illustrates the idea of the method .",
    "left panel shows the velocity profile from simulation results for a dpd fluid at density @xmath33 . ]    the idea of the momentum interchange method @xcite is to produce this counter flux by swapping the momentum of particles with a certain rate .",
    "the algorithm of one interchange works as follows ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : shear_flow ] , right ) :    1 .",
    "choose the particle with the highest velocity in @xmath34-direction in the middle slab 2 .",
    "choose the particle with the highest velocity in @xmath35-direction in the top slab 3 .",
    "swap the momentum of these two particles    the shear rate @xmath36 will depend on the rate of these momentum interchange steps and the velocity profile will be linear in good approximation if the interchange rate is not too large ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : shear_flow ] , left ) .",
    "unfortunately , the momentum interchange method can not be used for creating steady - state _ divergent _ flow ( with gradient @xmath37 ) .",
    "this is because the transported momentum @xmath30 and the direction of flux @xmath38 are no longer orthogonal .",
    "in fact , the directions of particle and momentum transport are parallel and therefore a transport of _ particles _ is necessary to maintain the steady - state .",
    "this can be achieved in two different ways : either by manually displacing particles or by imposing a global flow .",
    "our two methods of generating steady - state divergent flow are based on these two types of mass transport .",
    "the methods can be motivated theoretically by solving the mass and momentum continuity equations with appropriate source terms .",
    "the local conservation of mass on a continuum level with source term reads : @xmath39 with density @xmath40 , velocity field @xmath41 and mass source term @xmath42 .",
    "similarly one can write down the local conservation of momentum : @xmath43 with the external force field @xmath44 and the constitutive relation @xcite : @xmath45 with flow field @xmath41 , pressure @xmath46 , shear viscosity @xmath47 and bulk viscosity @xmath1 .",
    "the external force and mass source terms can be chosen freely and allow us to manipulate the flow and density profiles . however , to conserve global mass and momentum both the mass source term @xmath42 and the force field @xmath48 must fulfill the relations : @xmath49 in the following , we assume that the fluid is barotropic , i.e. , there exists a unique relation @xmath50 .",
    "we are interested in stationary solutions @xmath51 and @xmath52 , where @xmath53 exhibits a gradient in @xmath54-direction and profiles are constant in all other directions . assuming that higher order derivatives of the flow field can be neglected , we obtain the following equations : @xmath55      in the particle transfer method , we aim at creating a velocity gradient while keeping the density profile constant , @xmath56 .",
    "this leads to @xmath57 to get a linear profile @xmath58 , one therefore has to choose a mass source term @xmath59 and a force term @xmath60 which vanishes at order @xmath61 .",
    "these source terms can be realized by transferring particles between two halves of the box at a certain rate ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : divergence_exchange ] ) .",
    "the algorithm is very simple :    1 .",
    "choose a random particle in the right half of the simulation box 2 .",
    "place it at a random position in the left half of the simulation box     particle transfer method to generate steady - state divergent flow .",
    "bottom panel illustrates the idea of the method .",
    "upper panels show corresponding simulation results for the velocity ( top ) and the density ( middle ) of a dpd fluid at mean density @xmath33 . in this method , the density is roughly constant . ]",
    "this algorithm conserves momentum and  in the special case of vanishing conservative forces  also energy . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : divergence_exchange ] , the resulting velocity profile is approximately linear and the density profile almost constant , in perfect agreement with the above described theoretical prediction . therefore , this algorithm is perfectly suitable to study the bulk viscosity @xmath1 of fluids that are interacting only via soft potentials .",
    "+   + however , the particle transfer method can become problematic in the presence of hard - core potentials , like the widely used lennard - jones potential , because particle insertion in dense fluids is difficult and usually associated with large energy penalties .      in the force driven method",
    "there is no particle transfer and hence no mass source term , @xmath62 .",
    "this directly leads to @xmath63 const .",
    "a velocity gradient is invariably associated with a density gradient , and can only exist if the mean velocity @xmath64 is nonzero .",
    "the force density now reads @xmath65 to create a linear profile @xmath66 , one therefore has to apply an external force @xmath67 where the constant is given by @xmath68 .",
    "+ these equations explain how to create a linear velocity profile in the absence of a mass source term : one has to create a steady - state particle flow in the presence of periodic boundary conditions by imposing a non - zero center of mass velocity . to create a divergent flow field ,",

    "this method has the great advantage that one does not have to manually change the position of particles .",
    "it can thus be used in combination with hard - core potentials .",
    "it is also physically more ",
    "realistic  since it only requires an external force and a non - zero flow velocity .",
    "therefore , the basic idea may be applicable in experiments .",
    "the main disadvantage of this technique is that the gradient in the flow field is unavoidably associated with a density gradient .",
    "this is a problem because the bulk viscosity strongly depends on the density .",
    "one can reduce the problem by applying a very small force .",
    "however , very long simulations are then necessary to obtain sufficiently good statistics .",
    "the solution used in this work is to calculate a bulk viscosity @xmath1 for every bin in the simulation box and associate it to the density in the respective box . in this way",
    "one obtains many data points for various densities that can be used to determine not only the bulk viscosity for a constant density but also the density dependence ( see sec .",
    "[ ssec : resultsbulk ] ) .",
    "we calculate the viscosity by direct evaluation of the local stress tensor using both newton s constitutive relation and a localized irving - kirkwood formula .",
    "this has the great advantage that one can decouple the problems of creating a steady - state flow and calculating viscosities . when using this method it is also possible to distinguish between the dissipative and the conservative contribution to the viscosity .",
    "the local stress tensor of an isotropic , compressible newtonian fluid can be calculated using newton s constitutive relation ( see eq .",
