    "inflationary cosmology  @xcite is currently the leading paradigm that describes the very early universe .",
    "inflation is driven by a substance that can be well approximated by a positive cosmological constant , and in practice it is usually realised by the potential energy of a ( nearly ) homogeneous scalar field , dubbed the inflaton .",
    "in fact , it is not known what is the precise nature of the substance that drives inflation , nor it is known what was the universe alike before inflation , close to the planck scale at which ( nonperturbative ) quantum gravity effects become important . string theory as the leading contender for quantum gravity is of little help here , since the desire to preserve supersymmetry after compactification to four space - time dimensions favors the compactification on six dimensional calabi - yau spaces on anti - de sitter ( ads ) backgrounds , _",
    "i.e. _ on space - times with a negative cosmological constant @xmath0 .",
    "this is clearly at odds with inflation , which requires ( a substance that can be well mimicked by ) a positive cosmological constant @xmath0 .   in this letter",
    "we construct a nonlocal cosmology that resolves this impasse .",
    "we show that in our model strong backreaction effects can lift the universe from an anti - de sitter phase to an inflating universe .",
    "we also show that the subsequent inflationary era can last long enough ( i.e. more than 60 e - foldings ) to solve all of the standard problems inflation is invoked to solve , which include the homogeneity , isotropy and causality problems , as well as that it can provide nearly scale invariant seeds for the large scale structure of the universe .",
    "finally , we show that the late time cosmology is that of matter era in model i and of radiation era in model ii . within our toy models",
    "we do not have a simple explanation for the dark energy of the universe .",
    "let us now for completeness recall some of the basics of standard cosmology .",
    "the metric of a flat homogeneous cosmology is @xmath1 , where @xmath2 denotes the scale factor , and the classical ( friedmann ) equations are , @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the hubble parameter ( @xmath5 ) , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the energy density and pressure of the ( perfect ) cosmological fluid and @xmath0 is the cosmological term .",
    "for simplicity we shall assume that the cosmological fluid obeys a constant equation of state , @xmath8 and we shall take @xmath9 . from the covariant conservation equation , @xmath10 , we immediately infer , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is an initial energy density .",
    "equations  ( [ friedmann1][friedmann2 ] ) admit solutions provided @xmath13 , _",
    "i.e. _ if the initial energy density of the fluid is large enough to compensate the negative cosmological constant  . in this case",
    "the solution of  ( [ friedmann1 ] ) is @xmath14       ^\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_0 } \\,;\\qquad   h(t ) = \\sqrt{\\frac{-\\lambda}{3}}\\cot\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{-\\lambda}{3}}\\epsilon_0t\\right ) \\ , ,",

    "hence this universe resembles a closed universe . for a large @xmath21",
    "the universe is short lived , and thus it does not constitute a realistic model of the universe .",
    "the question we address next is how to repair the model and make a realistic universe with a negative cosmological constant .",
    "to study the quantum backreaction in cosmology is hard , so one often resorts to studying toy models , which capture important features of the quantum backreaction in realistic cosmological settings .",
    "our main inspiration here are the simple model of nonlocal cosmology proposed by deser and wooodard  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) and the nonlocal model considered in ref .",
    "we emphasize however that , apart from their simplicity , and the hope that these models incorporate some important features of the quantum backreaction , these models are used primarily to illustrate the main idea : to demonstrate that cosmology with the quantum backreaction included can exhibit qualitatively different behavior from standard cosmology .    to model the backreaction , we shall endow the friedmann equation  ( [ friedmann1 ] ) with the nonlocal operator @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the retarded green s function of the scalar dalembertian operator on a homogeneous expanding background , @xmath24 $ ] .",

    "note that the integral term in  ( [ friedmann : nonlocal ] ) and its time derivative are both equal to zero at @xmath33 .",

    "the solid gray line represents the ricci scalar curvature @xmath30 , which  as the backreaction builds up  shows the characteristic oscillatory behavior .",
    "the backreaction term ( shown in dotted blue ) grows mostly during the time when the ricci scalar is large .",
    "when the backreaction grows large enough ( corresponding to a time @xmath35 for the current choice of parameters ) , the universe exits from the oscillating phase end enters inflation . for comparison",
    ", we also show the first few ` oscillations ' of the ricci scalar  ( [ ricci scalar : local ] ) for the corresponding local cosmology ( dashed red ) , whose value blows up at the times @xmath36 ( that signify the big bang and the big crunch singularities ) . for this plot",

    "( radiation ) ought to be excluded because we solve the trace friedmann equation , to which radiation does not contribute . likewise , a matter with @xmath41 mimics the cosmological constant , and hence it also should be excluded . ] to study how the nonlocal backreaction term in  ( [ friedmann : nonlocal ] ) modifies the universe s evolution , it is instructive to look at the ricci scalar @xmath30 , which we plot in figure  [ fig : model1:oscillatory ] in units of @xmath42 .",

    "( [ ricci scalar : local ] ) diverges ( dashed red line ) . in figure  [ fig : model1:oscillatory ] we also show the contribution of the backreaction term to the ricci curvature ( blue dotted line ) , from which we see that the backreaction grows mainly during the intervals when the ricci scalar is very large ( nonadiabatic regime ) .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the behavior shown in figure  [ fig : model1:oscillatory ] is generic , in the sense that the preinflationary oscillatory epoch is generic as long as initially @xmath9 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "a further generic property of the model is that the oscillatory epoch ends when the backreaction grows sufficiently large such to compensate the negative cosmological term , terminating in inflation .",
    "the number and the length of oscillations depends , of course , on the choice of parameters . clearly , for a smaller value of the backreaction coupling @xmath28 there will be more oscillations , while the size of @xmath21 ( and to a certain extent @xmath45 ) determines the length of each oscillation .",
    "next , we consider the inflationary epoch .      ) with a negative @xmath0 and a matter component with the equation of state parameter @xmath34 .",

    "the hubble parameter ( solid blue line ) decreases approximately linearly with time . after inflation ends , the hubble parameter @xmath50 oscillates , as shown in the inset . during this oscillatory stage @xmath47",
    "remains mostly positive ( corresponding to an expanding phase ) , although there are small intervals during which @xmath51 ( corresponding to a brief contracting phase ) .",
    "[ fig : model1:inflation],width=480 ]    in figure  [ fig : model1:inflation ] we show the evolution of the scale factor @xmath52 ( dashed red line ) and the hubble parameter ( in units of @xmath53 ) ( solid blue line ) during the subsequent inflationary epoch , that follows the oscillatory epoch .",
    "there are two notable features characterizing the inflationary period in our model : ( 1 ) a linear ` decay ' of the hubble parameter in cosmological time and ( 2 ) oscillations in the scale factor ( and the hubble parameter ) that follow the inflationary epoch .",
    "the linear decay of @xmath47 could be tested by precisely measuring the dependence of the power spectrum of scalar cosmological perturbations on momentum scale .",
    "namely , from the slow roll approximation we know that the scalar spectrum amplitude squared ( at the hubble crossing ) is given by , @xmath54 , where we used @xmath55 . from this formula",
    "it follows that the spectrum slope is given by @xmath56 , where we made use of @xmath57  .",
    "the oscillatory phase following inflation ( see the inset ) is reminiscent of the preinflationary oscillatory epoch .",
    "but , unlike during the preinflationary stage , here the effective cosmological constant is small and positive .",
    "these oscillations are due to the oscillations in the backreaction term and , as times goes on , they get slowly damped . as we show in the next section , after inflation the universe enters a matter era .",
    "the number of e - foldings in the model is quite sensitive on the strength of the backreaction @xmath28 in  ( [ friedmann : nonlocal ] ) . in general , for smaller couplings @xmath28 one gets longer inflation .",
    "we find that it is quite easy to get 60 ( and much more ) e - foldings of inflation . in the example shown in figure  [ fig : model1:inflation ] , @xmath48 $ ] and the number of e - foldings is about @xmath49 . on the other hand ,",

    "we show the scale factor @xmath2 ( solid blue line ) at late times .",
    "the scale factor follows the time dependence of a nonrelativistic matter @xmath60 ( shown for illustration as the solid red line ) , on which small amplitude oscillations are superimposed ( see the inset ) .",
    "the curve @xmath61 can be clearly distinguished from other power law expansions . to show that , we also plot a radiation era curve ( red dashed ) , @xmath62 , which clearly does not fit .",
    "the parameters are the same as in figure 2 : @xmath48 $ ] and @xmath34 .",
    "[ fig : model1:matter era],width=480 ]    the late time evolution of the universe in our model is characterized by a matter era , with the scale factor @xmath60 , on which small oscillations are superimposed .",
    "this can be nicely seen in figure  [ fig : model1:matter era ] , where the suitably adjusted matter era curve ( solid red ) completely overlaps with the numerical solution ( solid blue curve ) , suggesting that the quantum backreaction term studied here can be a viable dark matter candidate .",
    "we emphasize that the nonrelativistic matter late time evolution is independent on the equation of state parameter @xmath45 of the preinflationary matter .",
    "the small oscillations ( that can be seen in the inset of figure  [ fig : model1:matter era ] ) are a memory of the inflationary stage , and characterize this model .",
    "these oscillations are slowly damped with time , such that even at very late times ( in our figure @xmath63 ) they are important in the sense that the universe goes through periods of accelerated and decelerated expansion . the question which we at this stage can not answer is whether this feature can be used to explain the dark energy of the universe , or perhaps to rule out the model .",
    "whatever may be true , the postinflationary oscillations in the scale factor in a model with a realistic quantum backreaction will have to produce oscillations that are more damped than in the model studied here .",

    "therefore , just like in the case of model i , our model  ii produces a universe which , at late times , qualitatively differs from that of standard cosmology ( which exhibits a big crunch ) .",
    "instead , the quantum backreaction term in model ii compensates precisely the negative cosmological constant and the universe asymptotes a radiation era at late times . unlike in model  i , model  ii neither exhibits an oscillatory nor inflationary epoch .",

    "the late times ricci scalar mimics that of a matter ( radiation ) era .",
