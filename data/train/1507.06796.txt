    "recently , a theorem announced by schrder and simpson in @xcite and presented with a proof in @xcite has attracted some attention . before stating this result we need some preparations .",
    "let @xmath1 be an arbitrary topological space .",
    "the emphasis is on non - hausdorff spaces like directed complete partially ordered sets (= dcpos ) with the scott topology ( see @xcite ) and quotients of countably based spaces ( qcb - spaces , see @xcite ) .",
    "but , of course , compact and locally compact hausdorff spaces are classical examples .",
    "we consider functions defined on @xmath1 with values in @xmath2 , the set @xmath3 of nonnegative real numbers extended by @xmath4 as top element .",
    "such functions @xmath5 are _ lower semicontinuous _ if , for every @xmath6 , the set @xmath7 is open in @xmath1 .",
    "we denote by @xmath8 the set of all lower semicontinuous functions @xmath9 with the pointwise defined order .",
    "the pointwise supremum of any family of lower semicontinuous functions is lower semicontinuous so that @xmath8 is a complete lattice .",
    "the pointwise defined sum @xmath10 of two lower semicontinuous functions @xmath11 as well as the scalar multiple @xmath12 for @xmath13 are also lower semicontinuous .",

    "on @xmath19 one also has a pointwise defined order , addition and multiplication by nonnegative real numbers .",
    "we endow @xmath19 with the weak@xmath0upper topology , that is , the coarsest topology such that the evaluation maps @xmath20 remain lower semicontinuous for all @xmath21 .",
    "the schrder - simpson theorem says :    [ ss ] for every linear functional @xmath22 which is lower semicontinuous with respect to the weak@xmath0upper topology , there is an @xmath23 such that @xmath24 for all @xmath25 .",
    "this theorem sounds exactly like a simple general fact from classical functional analysis ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter iv , 1.2 ) ) : _ let @xmath26 be a topological vector space over the field of real numbers and @xmath27 the dual vector space of all continuous linear functionals @xmath28 , then every linear functional @xmath29 defined on the topological dual @xmath27 which is continuous with respect to the weak@xmath0 topology is the evaluation at some @xmath30 , that is , @xmath31 for every @xmath32 .",
    "_ here the weak@xmath0 topology is the coarsest topology on @xmath27 such that all the evaluation maps @xmath33 , @xmath30 , remain continuous .",
    "( here @xmath34 is meant to carry the usual hausdorff topology ) .",
    "the idea behind the quite simple proof of this classical result is to reduce the question to the finite dimensional case , where it is trivial .",
    "the schrder - simpson theorem is a kind of asymmetric version of this classical fact in a special situation .",
    "its original proof was technical and involved .",
    "a new proof in a conceptual framework was published in @xcite . a short proof by j.  goubault - larrecq @xcite has appeared just recently .",
    "let us remark that the schrder - simpson theorem has a predecessor in domain theory : if @xmath1 is a continuous dcpo ( with the scott topology ) , then @xmath19 is a continuous dcpo , too , and every scott - continuous linear functional on @xmath19 is the evaluation at some @xmath23 ( see c. jones @xcite and kirch @xcite ) . for a continuous dcpo @xmath1 , the scott topology on @xmath19 agrees with the weak@xmath0upper topology as kirch @xcite has shown , a fact that is now longer true for more general spaces .",
    "thus , the schrder - simpson theorem is a far reaching generalization .",
    "the proofs of the schrder - simpson theorem due to keimel and goubault - larrecq are based on two lemmas that hold for every lower semicontinuous linear functional @xmath29 from the valuation powerdomain @xmath35 with the weak@xmath0upper topology into @xmath2 , where @xmath1 is any topological space :    ( lemma 2 in @xcite , theorem 5.3 in @xcite ) [ lem:2 ] there is a family @xmath17 of functions in @xmath8 such that @xmath36 for every @xmath25 .",
    "( lemma 1 in @xcite , lemma 5.5 in @xcite ) [ lem:1 ] the set of all @xmath23 such that @xmath37 for all @xmath25 is directed .",
    "the schrder - simpson theorem [ ss ] can now be deduced as follows : given a lower semicontinuous linear @xmath38 , lemma [ lem:2 ] gives us a family of @xmath17 of functions in @xmath8 such that @xmath36 for all @xmath25 . by lemma [ lem:1 ]",
    "the family @xmath17 can be chosen to be directed and we let @xmath39 . since the valuations @xmath40 are scott - continuous on @xmath8 , they preserve directed suprema and we obtain that @xmath41 for all @xmath40 .",
    "in fact , it suffices to find a subcone @xmath42 of @xmath8 and to prove the two lemmas above for subfamilies of @xmath42 , for example for the subcone of step functions .",
    "it is desirable to prove an analogue of the schrder - simpson theorem for situations different from the valuation powerdomain . for the moment",
    "i do not know how to generalize lemma [ lem:1 ] . for lemma [ lem:2 ] ,",
    "a general conceptual argument had been developed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.1 ) by reducing the problem to a situation close to the classical vector space situation ; but this argument needed some quite heavy background from the theory of quasi - uniform locally convex cones .",
    "goubault - larrecq found a simple direct argument for the proof of lemma [ lem:2 ] for the special situation of the valuation powerdomain . in this note",
    "we present a direct approach to lemma [ lem:2 ] based on goubault - larrecq s idea but in an appropriate generality .",
    "it uses the classical idea to reduce the problem to the finite dimensional case .",
    "let us recall the motivation behind all of this .",
    "the schrder - simpson theorem concerns the probabilistic powerdomain over arbitrary topological spaces used in semantics for modelling probabilistic phenomena in programming .",
    "goubault - larrecq @xcite recently has applied the result in his work on modelling probabilistic and ordinary nondeterminism simultaneously .",
    "the schrder - simpson theorem can not be proved with methods from classical functional analysis , since the real - valued lower semicontinuous functions on a topological space @xmath1 do not form a vector space . for a lower semicontinuous function @xmath43 ,",
    "its negative @xmath44 is not necessarily lower semicontinuous .",
    "similarly , we are in an asymmetric situation for the valuations , those being scott - continuous linear functionals .",
    "we therefore work with cones , a weakening of the notion of a vector space by restricting scalar multiplication to nonnegative reals and not requiring the existence of additive inverses .",
    "this offers the advantage of including infinity . in this section",
    "we provide some basic concepts .",
    "the connection to our goal will appear only later .",
    "we denote by @xmath3 the set of nonnegative real numbers with the usual linear order , addition and multiplication . the letters @xmath45 will always denote nonnegative reals . further @xmath46 denotes the nonnegative reals extended by @xmath4 as a top element .",
    "we also extend addition and multiplication from @xmath3 to @xmath2 by defining @xmath47 for all @xmath48 and @xmath49    [ cone]a _ cone _ is a commutative monoid @xmath42 carrying a scalar multiplication by nonnegative real numbers satisfying the same axioms as for vector spaces ; that is , @xmath42 is endowed with an addition @xmath50 and a neutral element @xmath51 satisfying : @xmath52 and with a scalar multiplication @xmath53 satisfying:@xmath54 for all @xmath55 and all @xmath56 . an _ ordered cone _ is a cone @xmath42 endowed with a partial order @xmath57 , such that addition and multiplication by fixed scalars @xmath58 are order preserving , that is , for all @xmath59 and all @xmath60 : @xmath61    unlike for vector spaces , addition in cones need not satisfy the cancellation property , and cones need not be embeddable in vector spaces . for example",
