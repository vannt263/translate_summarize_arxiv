    "we study in this paper a long - distance contribution to the decay @xmath0 , which has the interesting feature of possessing a large dynamical phase . when added to the short - distance amplitude determined by the @xmath1 penguin operator , this produces an asymmetry @xmath4 between @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "in addition , the presence of the long - distance component affects the polarization state ( stokes vector ) of the photon .",
    "this effect can be measured in the decay @xmath17 .",
    "an analogous effect on the stokes vector occurs in the decay @xmath13 .",
    "the stokes vector turns out to be very sensitive to the proposed long - distance contribution and thus may give more insight into the structure of the radiative decay amplitude .",
    "the main contribution to the amplitude of the decay @xmath0 is believed to come from the effective hamiltonian @xmath18 @xmath19 is fermi s constant , @xmath20 the ckm matix elements , @xmath21 the wilson coefficient and @xmath22 is the electromagnetic penguin operator @xmath23 the corresponding amplitude contains a parity conserving ( magnetic ) term and a parity violating ( electric ) term and can be written as @xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the momentum of the @xmath26 meson , @xmath27 is the momentum of the photon and @xmath28 its polarization vector , @xmath29 is the momentum of the @xmath30 meson and @xmath31 its polarization vector .",
    "( the subscript @xmath32 denotes short - distance . )    using the identity @xmath33 it immediately follows that @xmath34 since only one weak phase is involved , this amplitude on its own produces no @xmath3 violation .",
    "the branching ratio is : @xmath35 where @xcite @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the form factor of the @xmath38 transition due to the tensor current @xcite .",
    "the decay @xmath0 possesses another observable : the stokes vector , specifiying the polarization state of the photon . conforming to the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite , we rewrite the decay amplitude ( [ amplitudepengdom ] ) in the general form @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 , the dots denoting further interaction terms to be introduced later .",
    "the polarization of the photon is defined by the density matrix @xmath42 : @xmath43 where @xmath44 are the pauli matrices and @xmath45 is the stokes vector .",

    "we introduce an extra contribution to the @xmath0 amplitude that carries not only a different weak phase but a non - trivial dynamical ( strong ) phase , thereby generating non - vanishing values for the observables @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
