    "target only the final @xmath12 .",
    "the isometries are optimized by repeated up- and down - sweeps to provide the best final state .",
    "each isometry alone and the whole set of isometries in tune are serving the single goal to make the targeted state as accurate as possible .",
    "unlike in the time evolution , they are not compromised to provide accurate thermal states at intermediate imaginary times . even if @xmath5 is the best peps tensor at the final @xmath12 , @xmath124 does not need to be the best one at @xmath125 .",
    "the last property contributes to the main advantage of the variational peps - ttn over time evolution .",
    "the variational algorithm can probe a low temperature phase without any need to evolve from infinite temperature across a critical point .",
    "not only there is no direct evolution through intermediate temperatures , but also the intermediate tensors @xmath124 do not need to be thermal states at all . the problems with evolution across the critical point are illustrated in figure [ fig : compare ] , where we compare three ferromagnetic magnetization curves obtained with three different algorithms .",
    "the direct evolution runs into trouble at the critical point , where exact evolution would require a divergent @xmath87 , and the magnetization makes a discontinuous jump .",
    "this problem can be partly circumvented by adding a tiny symmetry breaking bias to the hamiltonian , h  =  -_m z_m , that smooths the transition making the necessary @xmath87 finite , but significantly alters the physics at the critical point .",
    "nevertheless , the bias allows smooth evolution from infinite temperature deep into the low temperature phase , where the effect of the tiny bias becomes negligible .",
    "however , even the bias can not prevent the evolution from accumulating errors with time .",
    "in retrospect , it may be tempting to combine the new variational strategy with the mps ansatz instead of ttn .",
    "after all , the powerful methods developed for mps @xcite may be efficient enough to optimize even the huge number @xmath122 of isometries .",
    "unfortunately , these methods can not be applied in 2d . instead",
    ", the isometries in mps have to be optimized by the procedures in fig .",
    "[ fig : peps ] combined with cmr . since an isometry in mps maps from @xmath126 to @xmath28 dimensions , rather than from @xmath74 to @xmath28 in ttn , the procedures are more efficient for mps than for ttn . however , the actual bottleneck that limits @xmath28 on an infinite lattice is the cmr whose cost depends only on the net @xmath28 and not on the underlying ansatz .",
    "thus with mps one can achieve the same @xmath28 as with ttn , but at the expense of an algorithm that is linear instead of logarithmic in @xmath127 .",
    "apart from this , the linear algorithm has a lot more variational parameters , hence in principle it may be more liable to getting trapped in local maxima of the figure of merit",
    ". however , this discussion does not quite exclude mps in some applications like , e.g. , a finite lattice .",
    "the proposed peps - ttn method is the first 2d finite - temperature tensor - network algorithm that is both variational and becomes numerically exact with increasing bond dimension .",
    "it avoids the demanding direct imaginary time evolution and employs full tensor environment in variational optimization .",
    "there is still a lot of room for improvement and development .",
    "for instance , the simple ttn could be made more powerful with some unitary disentanglers @xcite .",
