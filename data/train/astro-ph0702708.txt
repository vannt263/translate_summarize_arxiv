    "three ir / optical robotic telescopes for prompt observation of grbs and afterglows are being developed . the project , _ mitsume , _ is promoted by tokyo tech , national astronomical observatory of japan ( naoj ) , the institute of cosmic - ray research ( iccr ) , kyoto university , and aoyama gakuin university .",
    "_ mitsume _ stands for _ multicolor imaging telescopes for survey and monstrous explosions , _ and also means _ three eyes _ in japanese .",
    "the objective of the project is multi - band photometry from @xmath5 to @xmath6 of grbs and afterglows within tens of seconds and detection / determination of cosmological events with redshifts exceeding 10 .",
    "two optical telescopes , _",
    "akeno 50 cm _ and _ oao 50 cm _ , have been constructed at akeno observatory of the iccr , akeno in yamanashi prefecture , and at okayama astrophysical observatory ( oao ) of naoj , kamogata in okayama prefecture .",
    "each telescope has a _ tricolor camera _ capable of @xmath0-bands photometry .",
    "an existing 91-cm telescope at oao is being converted to an ir telescope , _ oaowfc _ ( oao wide field camera ) .",
    "it is designed to have a wide field of view of @xmath7 and perform @xmath8 photometry  @xcite .",
    "these three telescopes are to be automatically operated and respond to grb alerts .",
    "the specification of each telescope is shown in table  [ tab : spec ] .",
    "_ oao 50 cm _ can be maneuvered at a speed of 4 deg s@xmath9 , or within 45 s to any direction , and _ akeno 50 cm _ at a speed of 9 deg s@xmath9 , within 20 s to any direction .",
    "_ oao 50 cm _ and _ akeno 50 cm _ have large field of views of @xmath10 and are suitable for a source with a position uncertainty up to @xmath11 , which is typical for an on - board localization by grb monitoring missions . _",
    "oaowfc _ has an even larger field of view of @xmath12 , and will be used for a survey of mira variables when it is not occupied in a follow - up observation .",
    "a mixture system of @xmath6 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is adopted for _ akeno 50 cm _ and _ oao 50 cm _ instead of the standard johnson - cousins system  @xcite or the sdss system  @xcite .",
    "we have chosen @xmath6 rather than @xmath2 , because the broader bandwidth of the former would give a better sensitivity  @xcite .",
    "we have chosen @xmath14 rather than @xmath15 for the same reason . by selecting @xmath13 instead of",
