    "to determine @xmath7 , one needs to measure precise distances to galaxies sufficiently distant for local departures from a smooth hubble flow to be of negligible importance .",
    "consequently we need to extend the distance scale to distances of order @xmath8 mpc or more .",
    "although the _ hubble space telescope  _ ( _ hst _ ) has greatly extended the range of direct cepheid  based distances , it can not reach the region where the hubble flow dominates , and despite the successful determination of many new cepheid distances with _ hst _",
    ", the dispute over the global value of the hubble constant is still not settled .",
    "methods to reach the hubble flow via the virgo cluster through the use of various secondary distance indicators have tended to obtain values larger than @xmath9 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 ( @xcite ) , whereas methods using a cepheid calibration of the peak brightness of type ia supernovae consistently have given values below @xmath10 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently , methods based on correlations between light curve shapes and the luminosity of type ia supernovae ( @xcite ) , as well as the nebular sn ia method based on modeling of the forbidden line emission at late phases ( @xcite ) , have resulted in values in the range @xmath10@xmath9 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 .",
    "part of the problem is evidently the significant depth of the virgo cluster ( @xcite ) .",
    "this uncertainty is eliminated if secondary indicators can be applied to extend distance measurements directly to more remote clusters .",
    "hjorth & tanvir ( 1997 ) have combined the cepheid distance to the leo  i group ( @xcite ) with a comparison of the fundamental plane ( fp ) of early  type galaxies in the leo  i group with the fp of the coma cluster ( @xcite ) . also , baum _",
    "( 1995 , 1997 ) have directly compared the globular cluster luminosity functions for two giant ellipticals in the coma cluster with the combined luminosity function for the milky way and m31 .",
    "these studies also find values in the range @xmath10@xmath9 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 . in the same spirit",
    "we shall , for the first time , derive the distance to the coma cluster based on surface brightness fluctuations .",
    "the sbf method was introduced by tonry & schneider ( 1988 ) as a precise secondary distance indicator for early  type galaxies . until now applications of sbf distances",
    "have been limited to ground  based @xmath0band ( @xcite ) and @xmath11band ( @xcite ) observations .",
    "the superb resolution of the _",
    "hst  _ should , however , make the wfpc2 camera an ideal instrument for obtaining sbf distances to early  type galaxies in the coma cluster , the main difficulty being the relatively modest aperture of the telescope .",
    "a typical luminosity fluctuation must produce at least one detected photo electron during the total exposure time in order not to be overwhelmed by the photon noise .",
    "the present work is based on eight @xmath12  s exposures of ngc  4881 obtained with the pc1 camera in the wide ",
    "band @xmath13 ( @xmath0 ) filter .",
    "the basic data reductions are fully described by baum _ et  al . _",
    "our final sbf flux @xmath14 is equivalent to @xmath15 detected photons in the @xmath13band in a total exposure time of @xmath16  s.    surface brightness fluctuations are due to the random distribution of discrete point sources ( stars ) across the field of the detector . @xmath14",
    "is defined as the flux of a hypothetical ` fluctuation star ' which , when randomly spread across the detector , produces the same flux mean and variance per pixel as the observed stellar population .",
    "as the statistical properties of the power spectrum are completely determined by the mean and variance of the observed flux per pixel , we are allowed to simulate luminosity fluctuations by a spatially random distribution of a suitable number ( in this case @xmath17 stars / pixel ) of ` fluctuation stars ' over the field of the detector .",
    "we have thus obtained an accurate estimate of the random error , as well as the statistical bias , by reducing many such simulated fluctuation fields . a high resolution",
    "poissonian stellar fluctuation field is first convolved with a point spread function ( psf ) created by the tiny tim ( v4.0 ) program ( @xcite ) .",
    "subsequently , this array is rebinned to the resolution of the pc1 camera , resulting in a noiseless stellar fluctuation frame . finally , poissonian photon noise and gaussian read noise are added .",
    "the whole sequence is repeated @xmath18 times , and all these frames are reduced in the same way as the real data .",
    "the sample average of the derived sbf magnitudes is @xmath19  mag fainter than the true value ( i.e. , we must _ subtract  _",
    "@xmath20  mag from the derived values ) , and the standard deviation on a measurement of a single simulation ( @xmath21 s ) is @xmath22  mag .",
    "a kolmogorov ",
    "smirnov test ( @xcite ) did not detect any deviation from normality .",
    "our error estimate relies completely on the monte carlo simulations , which assume that the psf is well described by the tiny tim model .",
    "fortunately , figure  1 shows that the power spectrum of the tiny tim psf is a nearly perfect match to a high signal  to  noise power spectrum of an annular region near the center of m32 .",
    "the power spectrum is obtained from a 400 s @xmath13 exposure with the pc1 camera ( _ hst _ archive data , id5464 ) , and the fluctuation amplitude is derived from the same angular area and by the same procedure as we use for the ngc  4881 data .",
    "this shows that it is fully acceptable to use the tiny tim model instead of an empirical psf .",
    "we have chosen to derive the fluctuation magnitude @xmath1 for an annular region between @xmath23 and @xmath24 from the nucleus of ngc  4881 . in that region ,",
    "the white noise will be dominated by photon statistics , not by the read noise ( @xmath25 ) , and a good fit to a model galaxy is obtained ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "this letter is not the place for a detailed description of the sbf method , especially as many of the reduction procedures are quite similar to the ones described by sodemann & thomsen ( 1995 ) .",
    "instead , we shall concentrate our description on the steps that are specific for this particular application .",
    "the sbf amplitude , @xmath27 , is obtained from the radial power spectrum of the normalized residual image and the radial power spectrum of a high resolution psf ( a factor of 4 sub  sampling ) as calculated by the tiny tim ( v4.0 ) program ( @xcite ) .",
    "the volume of the psf is normalized to one , so the derived sbf amplitude ( flux ) corresponds to a total magnitude .",
    "specifically , @xmath28 is calculated using equation ( 15 ) in sodemann & thomsen ( 1995 ) .",
    "we must emphasize that the lowest wave numbers are omitted , as they are influenced by flat ",
    "fielding and galaxy fitting errors .    in figure  2",
    "we plot the scaled power spectrum of the psf on top of the radial power spectrum for the annular region in ngc  4881 .",
    "the constant power spectrum of the white noise , 0.030 dn , has been subtracted from the plotted data points .",
    "note that the high power values with wave numbers less than 12 are not used in our derivation of @xmath28 .",
    "we wish to thank the anonymous referee for pointing out that the power spectrum of the ngc 4881 data appeared more noisy than the power spectrum of the simulated data , i.e. , the power spectrum of the white noise in the ngc  4881 data was significantly higher than expected from photon noise and assumed read noise ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "several identifiable sources evidently contributed to this excess white noise : the actual read noise ( @xmath30 ) was higher than had been assumed , there was a poissonian noise associated with the subtracted dark current ( @xmath31 ) , and the effective number of frames was slightly less than 8 due to the rejection of pixels containing cosmic ray events .",
    "however , these identifiable sources did not completely explain all of the excess white noise .",
    "some of it must have been introduced by the pipeline processing .    in order to evaluate the importance of the excess white noise",
    ", we added the missing amount of gaussian noise to 25 of the already existing simulated fluctuation frames .",
    "the standard deviation on a measurement of a single simulation increased from @xmath22  mag to @xmath32  mag .",
    "figure  3 shows a plot of the scaled power spectrum of the psf on top of the radial power spectrum for one of the simulated fluctuation fields with the correct amount of gaussian noise added .",
    "although greater noise reduces the precision of our sbf distance to the coma cluster , it does not alter the sbf distance itself .",
    "our calculated amplitude is @xmath33 in @xmath12  s , which according to equation ( 7 ) of holtzman _ et  al . _ ( 1995 ) gives a total fluctuation magnitude of @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35  mag to this value in order to bring it onto the instrumental aperture ( @xmath36 ) system defined by holtzman _",
    "et  al . _",
    "in addition we must _ add  _",
    "@xmath20  mag because at the time of the ngc  4881 observations the ccd was operated at @xmath37  @xmath38c instead of @xmath39  @xmath38c , which was used after 23 april 1994 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we can transform the instrumental magnitude @xmath40 to cousins @xmath1 by applying holtzman _",
    "et  al . _",
    "s ( 1995 ) synthetic transformation , which is equivalent to @xmath41 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "9 ) ) for a typical red fluctuation color of @xmath42 .",
    "although it is possible that the transformation from the @xmath13 band to the cousins @xmath0band may be different for the fluctuations than it is for stars , we derived @xmath43 for a similar region in m32 , which is consistent with the transformation in light of the @xmath1 values given for m32 by tonry _",
    "et  al . _",
    "( 1990 ) and sodemann & thomsen ( 1996 ) .",
    "the fact that the @xmath40 for m32 ( where @xmath44 ) , transformed according to holtzman _",
    "_ , agrees with the ground  based @xmath1 for this galaxy does not completely ensure that there will be similar good agreement for the redder stellar populations of giant ellipticals .",
    "in order to settle this question we have compared @xmath45 , as derived from stellar population models ( @xcite ) having solar metallicity and ages between 2 gyr and 17 gyr , with @xmath46 for the giant stars used in the models . the fluctuation magnitude @xmath40 transforms , within a few hundreds of a magnitude , in the same way as the f814w magnitude of giant stars if one chooses the stars red enough to match the sbf colors .",
    "actually , a 12 gyr model , which matches the average @xmath47 index of our annulus in ngc  4881 , has an offset of @xmath48 and a fluctuation color of @xmath49 . a red giant library ",

    "the difference between this value and the offset @xmath52 given by holtzman _",

    "the difference between landolt & bessell filter passbands ( @xmath54 mag ) is an indication of the remaining uncertainty in the transformation of @xmath13 for m stars . in the following",
    "we shall use @xmath55 .",
    "the variance per pixel due to unmasked globular clusters ( gcs ) can be written as @xmath56 ( @xcite ) , where @xmath57 is the number of detected gcs per pixel , @xmath58 is a flux defining the location of the apparent gc luminosity function ( gclf ) , and @xmath59 is a factor that is calculated from the apparent gclf and the completeness function ( a detection probability ) . for a gaussian lf , @xmath59",

    "the variance per pixel due to unmasked background galaxies can be expressed as @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the number of detected background galaxies per pixel and @xmath67 is a factor that is calculated from the apparent galaxy lf and the completeness function .",
    "the slope of the galaxy lf is taken as the average of the values given for the @xmath0band by tyson ( 1988 ) and lilly _",
    "et  al . _",
    "( 1991 ) , respectively . for galaxies",
    "it is not so obvious that we can use our shifted completeness function for the @xmath63band to calculate @xmath67 for the @xmath0band , because galaxies have a much larger color spread than gcs .",
    "fortunately , the relative contribution from galaxies , as compared to the one from gcs , is only @xmath68 so we can safely neglect the error introduced by assuming that background galaxies have the same colors as the gcs .",
    "the contribution to the sbf flux from unmasked gcs and background galaxies is calculated as @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the mean galaxy flux per pixel .",
    "there are 13 detected gcs inside the annulus [ 3 , 5 ] , and we expect only about @xmath71 background galaxies brighter than detection threshold within the same annulus ( @xcite ) . using these values we find that we must decrease the measured sbf flux by @xmath72  dn .",
    "we must accordingly _",
    "@xmath73  mag in order to correct for the undetected point sources .",
    "if we instead use the gaussian gclf ( @xmath74 , @xmath75 ) suggested by whitmore ( 1996 ) we obtain a correction of @xmath76  mag , which is not significantly different from the value derived for the hyperbolic gclf .",
    "correction for the integrated spectrum of an elliptical galaxy at the coma distance is quite modest for the @xmath0band , but fluctuation colors are very red , so it is much larger for @xmath1 .",
    "correction for @xmath40 is @xmath77 mag , where the redshift ( @xmath78 ) of ngc  4881 relative to the sun ( @xcite ) has been used .",
    "the quoted error was estimated from a comparison of the k ",
    "corrections derived from stellar population models ( @xcite ) having solar metallicity and ages between 5  gyr and 12  gyr .",
    "the galactic absorption in the direction of ngc  4881 is @xmath79 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the final corrected fluctuation magnitude for ngc  4881 is then @xmath80 .",
    "we shall calibrate the sbf distance to ngc  4881 in terms of the distance @xmath81  mpc ( random errors ) to ngc  3379 @xmath82 m  105 in the leo  i group .",
    "we have adopted the _ average _ sbf distance for the leo  i group , as recently derived by tonry _",

    "the spiral galaxy m  96 interacts with a giant 200  kpc diameter hi ring ( @xcite ) orbiting the two central galaxies in the leo  i group , the e1 galaxy ngc  3379 and the s0 galaxy ngc  3384 .",
    "thus the distances to ngc  3379 and m  96 are tied together by a physical connection .",

    "the assigned error on the constant term mainly reflects the photometric zero point error .",
    "this formula should only be used to interpolate @xmath1 in the metallicity range @xmath93 .",
    "fortunately , thomsen & baum ( 1987 ) have measured the magnesium gradient for ngc  4881 to be @xmath94 mag arcsec@xmath95 . combining this gradient with dressler s ( 1984 ) measurement @xmath96 of the @xmath47 index within a @xmath97 region centered on the nucleus of ngc  4881 we obtain the following relation : @xmath98 , where the mean of @xmath99 for a disk with the same area as dressler s slit is @xmath100 , and the mean of @xmath99 for the annulus between @xmath101 and @xmath102 is @xmath103 .",
    "our best estimate of the @xmath47 index for the sbf annulus in ngc  4881 is thus @xmath104 . using our relation between @xmath1 and @xmath47 , a k  correction of @xmath105 , and a galactic extinction of @xmath106 ( @xcite ) , we find that a stellar population in ngc  3379 with the same @xmath47 index as the one in our sbf annulus in ngc  4881 has a fluctuation magnitude of @xmath107 .    based on our sbf measurements the best estimate of the relative distance modulus between ngc  3379 and ngc  4881 is @xmath108 ( random errors only ) , corresponding to a ( luminosity ) distance ratio of @xmath109 . using our adopted distance to ngc  3379 , @xmath81  mpc ,",
    "we finally obtain a distance modulus for the coma cluster of @xmath110 ( random errors only ) , corresponding to a luminosity distance of @xmath111  mpc .",
    "at small redshifts the distance modulus is given by @xmath112 , where @xmath113 ( @xcite ) , @xmath114 is the redshift of the coma cluster with respect to the cosmic background radiation ( @xcite ) , and @xmath7 is the hubble constant in km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 . if we assume that @xmath115 then @xmath116 .",
