    "the dynamics of systems interacting with their surroundings is in general very complicated . very often , however , the physical systems of interest are sufficiently isolated from their environment to allow the use of certain approximations such as the weak coupling approximation and the markovian approximation @xcite .",
    "the former one assumes that the interaction between the system and the environment is sufficiently weak , i.e. the system is quasi - closed .",
    "the latter one relies on the assumption that the characteristic times of the system are much longer than those of the environment , and it always assumes the validity of the weak coupling approximation .",
    "most of the results on open systems dynamics are based on the weak coupling and markovian approximations .",
    "recent studies have shown the limits of the markovian description of quantum computation and quantum error correction @xcite .",
    "moreover , nanotechnology - based devices using hybrid systems , e.g. combining quantum optical and solid state systems , have been investigated and seem to be very promising for future technological applications @xcite . in order to describe decoherence in many solid state systems",
    "non - markovian approaches need often to be used @xcite .",
    "finally , a comprehensive and complete understanding of the interaction between a quantum system and its environment , not relying on the weak coupling and/or markovian approximations , is crucial in order to clarify fundamental issues such as the quantum - classical border , and in order to gain new insight in the dynamics of quantum systems which are not in thermal equilibrium .    outside the region of validity of the markovian approximation the master equation describing the dynamics",
    "can not be usually cast in the well known lindblad form @xcite .",
    "this fact has several consequences : one for all , complete positivity of the dynamical map @xcite is not guaranteed anymore , and even positivity may be violated .",
    "the latter of this properties , i.e. positivity , is necessary to guarantee the statistical interpretation of the density matrix , while the former one ensures that the time evolution in the system - environment total space is unitary .",
    "non - lindblad master equations are much more difficult to solve , both analytically and numerically , than lindblad ones , and they may lead to non - physical behaviors such as , e.g. , violation of positivity of the dynamical map [ see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the break down of the positivity condition stems from the phenomenological nature of most of the non - markovian approaches .",
    "exact generalized master equations indeed , by definition , do not violate neither positivity nor complete positivity but they are generally far too complicated for providing useful means for studying the system dynamics .",
    "in this paper we focus on a basic model of an open quantum system with memory , i.e. a two - level system ( qubit ) interacting with a bosonic thermal reservoir .",
    "we apply a recently proposed post - markovian approach @xcite which interpolates between the exact kraus map and the markovian dynamics .",
    "we compare the solution of the post - markovian generalized master equation with the solution of the typical memory kernel master equation @xcite . for a specific physically interesting form of the reservoir spectral density it is possible to derive an exact solution starting from a microscopic description of the total system , i.e. system plus reservoir .",
    "this fact allows us to make a comparison between the phenomenological memory kernel approaches and the exact microscopic approach . from this comparison",
    "a new physical interpretation of the reservoir correlation function will emerge .",
    "finally the limitations of the memory kernel approaches will be underlined and issues related to the loss of positivity of the dynamical maps will be carefully analyzed .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we recall the post - markovian master equation and we present the solution for the case of a qubit interacting with a thermal reservoir . in sec .",
    "iii we recall the solution of the typically used generalized master equation with memory , we compare it to the post - markovian solution , and we analyze the non - physicalregion of the parameters space where positivity breaks down . in sec .",
    "iv we consider the exact solution and in sec .",
    "v we present conclusions .",
    "very recently a new general post - markovian master equation has been presented @xcite .",
    "an interesting feature of this phenomenological master equation is that , by construction , it interpolates between the generalized measurement interpretation of the exact kraus operator sum map , and the continuous measurement interpretation of the markovian dynamics .",
    "it is worth reminding that the dynamics of open quantum systems may be described equivalently either by means of the density matrix satisfying the master equation or by means of a stochastic wave function which is the solution of the stochastic schrdinger equation unravelling the dynamics @xcite . for markovian dynamics there",
    "exist a physical interpretation for the time evolution of the stochastic wave functions ( quantum trajectories ) .",
    "indeed it has been shown that the quantum trajectories describe the time evolution of the system conditioned to a continuous measurement of the environment @xcite .",
    "different types of detection schemes of the environment ( photon counting , homodyne and heterodyne detection ) correspond to different unravellings ( different types of stochastic schrdinger equations ) . at contrast , in the case of non - markovian dynamics , it has been shown that quantum trajectories do not have a physical interpretation @xcite although attempts to find an interpretation in extended hilbert states have been performed @xcite . in more detail",
    ", it turns out that the stochastic wave function at time @xmath0 represents the state the system would be in at that time if a measurement was performed on the environment at that time , and yielded a particular result ( generalized measurement interpretation ) .",
    "however , the wavefunction at time @xmath0 does not have any link with itself at times less then @xmath0 , and therefore there can not be any physical interpretation of the quantum trajectories , for non - markovian systems @xcite .",
    "the reason can be traced back to the finite correlation time characterizing the non - markovian bath .",
    "now , since the post - markovian master equation actually interpolates between the exact dynamics and the markovian dynamics , an analysis of the time evolution according to this equation may give new insight in the dynamics of non - markovian systems , in the possible physical phenomena taking place when the markovian approximation fails , and in their role in the break down of the continuous measurement interpretation .",
    "this is in fact what we are going to investigate in the rest of the paper .",
    "moreover , we will study the usefulness of the post - markovian master equation presented in ref .",
    "@xcite for the description of open quantum systems , comparing it to other common non - markovian approaches . to this aim",

    "a we recall the form of the solution of the markovian master equation via the damping basis method .    in the following",
    "we will focus on a widely use form of memory kernel , namely the exponential memory kernel @xmath10 it is worth stressing that @xmath11 , which hereafter we will call the shabani - lidar memory kernel , is a quantity introduced phenomenologically in ref .",
    "therefore , it should not be confused with the memory function , appearing in the second order approximation of the nakajima - zwanzig equation , which is related to the spectral density of the reservoir [ see , e.g. , @xcite , p.465 ] . in order to understand the meaning of the shabani - lidar memory kernel we recall",
    "that , in the measurement scheme approach to open quantum systems , the post - markovian master equation describes a situation in which a measurement of the environment at a time @xmath12 is followed by a markovian evolution , described in terms of continuous measurements of the environment at times @xmath13 .",
    "the time @xmath12 characterizes the bath memory effects . in this picture , the shabani - lidar memory kernel is a function which assigns weights to different measurements ( selecting different @xmath14 ) @xcite .",

    "finally we have considered the following physical implementation of the system : the qubit describes the excited and ground electronic state of an effective two - level atom crossing a high @xmath121 cavity ; the reservoir is formed by the quantized modes of the high @xmath121 cavity which are distributed according to a lorentzian peaked at the atomic bohr frequency .",
    "this physical system , typical of cavity qed , represents one of the few examples of exactly solvable open quantum systems .",
    "the comparison between the exact dynamics and the post - markovian and memory kernel solutions shows that there exist situations in which the post - markovian approach does not present any advantage over the second order approximated memory kernel master equation .",
    "the reason is traceable back to the fact that , by derivation , the post - markovian master equation can not describe accurately situations for which the characteristic time of the reservoir @xmath48 is greater than the characteristic time of the system @xmath49 .",
    "when @xmath122 the dynamics is characterized by virtual exchanges of energies between the system and the environment which can not be described by the post - markovian approach .",
    "such virtual processes , absent in the markovian dynamics , seem to be responsible for the lack of a physical interpretation of single quantum trajectories in terms of continuous measurements performed by the environment .",
