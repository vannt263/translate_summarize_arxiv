    "the general relativity ( gr ) has emerged as a highly successful theory for cosmological models , surviving various tests . in search of a generalization of gr emerged a theory of gravity known as modified @xmath0-gravity .",
    "an important consequence of this new theory resides in the fact that it is no longer necessary to introduce unknown entities to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe and the formation of structures .",
    "searching for further generalization , it was introduced also the palatini formalism where the most fundamental aspect to be noted is the independence , _ a priori _ , between the metric tensor and affine connection .    in this work , in order to study the formation of structures , we adopt a model described by @xmath0-gravity from the point of view of the palatini approach , which is able to describe the dynamics and the collapse of collisionless self - gravitating systems . to investigate this dynamics",
    ", it becomes necessary the introduction of the collisionless boltzmann and poisson equations for the fields .",
    "the boltzmann equation is an essential tool for the understanding of the processes that occurs in interstellar clouds , as the damping waves perturbations .",
    "here we investigated the jeans instability for physical systems that exhibit weak gravitational field , with slow variation or static and objects which moves slowly compared to the speed of light .",
    "this instability causes the collapse of interstellar gas clouds and hence , the formation of structures .",
    "this occurs when the internal pressure of the gas is not enough to prevent gravitational collapse .",
    "the aim of this work is to show the difference in the behavior between the solutions obtained from this model and from those obtained by @xmath0-gravity in the metric formalism in the newtonian limit [ 1 , 2 ] and by newtonian gravity [ 3 ] .",
    "here we adopt the signature @xmath1 and follow the book [ 4 ] for the conventions of the riemann tensor and its contractions .",
    "the action which represent the modified gravity theories reads @xmath2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath0 is an analytic function of the ricci scalar @xmath3 , @xmath4 denotes the gravitational field coupling and @xmath5 is the lagrangian density of the matter field .    from the variation of the action ( [ 1 ] ) according to the palatini formalism we get the modified einstein s field equations @xmath6 above @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the energy - momentum tensor of the gravitational sources . the ricci tensor @xmath9 and the affine connection @xmath10 are given in terms of the riemannian ricci tensor @xmath11 and connection @xmath12 by @xmath13.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the newtonian approach the metric tensor can be written in terms of the minkowski tensor @xmath14 plus corrections of order @xmath15 [ 4 ] as @xmath16 and @xmath17 . up to this order",
    "we have @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are gravitational potentials associated with @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .    in this work",
    "we consider the following expression for @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a small quantity . the function proportional to @xmath25",
    "is not able to reproduce an accelerated expansion of the universe as it is currently observed .",
    "however , it should not be a problem , since the formation of structures , which is the focus of this work , occurred at a period much earlier than the current acceleration of the universe . in this case",
    "the trace of ( [ 3a ] ) in the @xmath26 approximation reads @xmath27 or by considering @xmath28 an invertible operator @xmath29,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is an approximation up to the order @xmath30 .",
    "since @xmath31 the time component of the ricci tensor ( [ 3a ] ) in the @xmath26 approximation reduces to @xmath32.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the source of the gravitational field is a pressureless fluid where the components of the energy - momentum tensor are given by @xmath33 with @xmath34 denoting the fluid mass density .",
    "now the time component and the trace of einstein s field equations ( [ 2 ] ) together with ( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) leads to the following system of poisson equations @xmath35 respectively .",
    "if we sum the above equations and consider @xmath36 , the standard poisson equation is recovered .",
    "now the aim is to obtain from the collisionless boltzmann equation in the newtonian limit a criterion for the collapse of stellar systems , which is related with a dispersion relation .",
    "the collisionless boltzmann equation has the following form in the newtonian limit @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the distribution function , which gives the mass density of the stellar system through @xmath39    we consider that the self - gravitating equilibrium system  described by a time - independent distribution function @xmath40 and potentials @xmath41 and @xmath42  is subjected to a small perturbation , namely , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , where @xmath46 .",
    "the equilibrium for a homogeneous system is achieved by jeans `` swindle '' that allows us to make @xmath47 and @xmath48 without loss of consistency .",
    "after these considerations , we linearize the boltzmann ( [ 8 ] ) and the field equations ( [ 7a ] ) , ( [ 7b ] ) through the substitution of the above conditions .",
    "subsequently we write the resulting equations in fourier space as follows @xmath49 where the overbarred quantities indicate the fourier transforms in the @xmath50 space .    by eliminating the overbarred quantities from the system of equations ( [ 10a ] ) - ( [ 10c ] )",
    "it follows the dispersion relation @xmath51    in stellar systems one assumes usually the maxwell distribution function @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a dispersion velocity and @xmath54 a constant mass density .    without loss of generality we can choose @xmath55 so that the dispersion relation ( [ 11 ] ) together with (",
    "[ 12 ] ) can be integrated with respect to the velocity components @xmath56 and @xmath57 , yielding @xmath58 here we have introduced the jeans wavenumber @xmath59 and the integration variable @xmath60 .",
    "unstable solutions are such that @xmath61 and @xmath62 [ 3 ] . in this case",
    "the integral on the right - hand side of ( [ 13 ] ) can be evaluated [ 5 ] and the dispersion relation ( [ 13 ] ) reduces to @xmath63 above @xmath64 is the complementary error function and we have introduced the same parametrization for @xmath65 that was adopted by [ 1 ] .",
    "the choice of this parameterization was made with the intention of describing a dimensionless ratio and to compare directly with the work done in [ 1 ] .",
    "other choices could have been made , but they all culminate in the same result , differing only by constants . without the terms within the brackets in the numerator and denominator on the left - hand side of (",
    "[ 14 ] ) , it follows the classical dispersion relation for newtonian gravity .",
    "the terms within round brackets refer to the contribution of the @xmath0 theory in the metric formalism [ 1 ] , while the ones within the round and angular brackets correspond to the palatini formalism .",
    "the solution of ( [ 14 ] ) for @xmath66 furnishes the following limiting values for the wavenumber : ( a ) @xmath67 for the @xmath0 theory in the palatini formalism , ( b ) @xmath68 for the @xmath0 theory in the metric formalism and ( c ) @xmath69 in the newtonian theory . for comparison , the dispersion relation ( [ 14 ] )",
    "is plotted in fig .",
    "1 together with the results obtained from the @xmath0 theory in the metric formalism and from the newtonian gravity .",
    "the gravitational collapse occurs for the unstable wave solutions where the values of @xmath70 lie below the curves in fig .",
    "1 . above these values",
    "the oscillations remain stable .",
    "we infer from this figure that the @xmath0 theory in the palatini formalism furnishes a large range of solutions than the metric one , which in its turn is larger than the one of the newtonian theory .",
    "the stellar system is stable up to a critical mass and if this critical value is exceeded the gravitational collapse occurs . in the newtonian theory",
    "this critical value is the jeans mass @xmath71 , which is defined as the mass within a sphere of diameter @xmath72 , i.e , @xmath73 . from the above results one",
    "obtain the following ratios : ( a ) @xmath74 for the @xmath0 theory in the palatini formalism and ( b ) @xmath75 for the @xmath0 theory in the metric formalism .",
    "hence the @xmath0 theory in the palatini formalism furnishes the smallest critical mass for the occurrence of the gravitational collapse .     versus normalized frequency @xmath76 from the dispersion relation ( [ 14 ] ) for @xmath0-gravity in palatini formalism ( bold line ) , for @xmath0-gravity in metric formalism ( thin line ) and for newtonian gravity ( dashed line).,width=260 ]",
    "the dispersion relation is a collapse criterion for infinite homogeneous fluid and stellar systems . here , this relation is used to study the instability of collisionless systems .",
    "figure 1 shows the behavior of the dispersion relation of the models : newtonian gravity , @xmath0-gravity in the metric formulation and this one in the palatini formalism .",
    "it is worth stressing that the characteristic wavenumber is given in terms of the classical one .",
    "the model proved to have a higher instability limit when compared to the others .",
    "the collapse occurs for higher values of the wavenumber when compared with the jeans wavenumber , so that critical mass of interstellar clouds decreases , modifying the initial conditions to start the collapse .",
    "the dispersion relation obtained via palatini formulation differs from that obtained via metric formulation only for terms of order up to @xmath30 ; below this order , no difference was found .",
    "the terms of order @xmath30 arise only in the palatini solution , when one writes the generalized ricci scalar depending on the usual one .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the differences reported here are a direct result of using the palatini formalism .",
    "the jeans mass is a criterion for the study of gravitational collapse of interstellar clouds .",
    "the cloud is stable for sufficiently small mass ( at a given temperature and radius ) , smaller than the limit established by jeans mass .",
    "if this cloud exceeds this mass limit , it starts a process of contraction until some other force can impede the total collapse .",
    "it was shown that the jeans mass for the systems described by @xmath0-gravity via palatini formalism exhibits values smaller than the ones found for the metric case , and especially for newtonian gravitation .",
    "this demonstrates that the limit for initiating the collapse of an interstellar cloud is below the classical limit favoring more the formation of structures .",
    "we may interpret this result by saying that the same amount of matter is able to produce a larger curvature , causing a larger acceleration of test particles .",
    "hence the test particles describe a different geodesic than that they would follow in the metric formalism . in this way",
    ", we conclude that in the palatini formalism of @xmath0 gravity the formation of structures is more efficient than in the metric formalism of @xmath0 gravity and newtonian gravity .    *",
