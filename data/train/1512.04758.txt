    "the 2015 nobel prizes in physics is a great acknowledgment of the fundamental importance of the model - independent discoveries of neutrino oscillations in the super - kamiokande atmospheric neutrino experiment @xcite and in the sno solar neutrino experiment @xcite .",
    "these discoveries , which proved that neutrinos are massive and mixed particles , led to the standard three - neutrino mixing paradigm ( @xmath1 ) , in which the three active neutrinos @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 are superpositions of three massive neutrinos @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 with respective masses @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ( see ref .",
    "there are two independent squared - mass differences , the small solar @xmath11 and the larger atmospheric @xmath12 , which can be interpreted as @xmath13 and @xmath14 , with @xmath15 ( see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "the completeness of the @xmath1 mixing paradigm has been challenged by the following indications in favor of short - baseline neutrino oscillations , which require the existence of at least one additional squared - mass difference , @xmath16 ( see the review in ref .",
    "@xcite ) :    1 .   the reactor antineutrino anomaly @xcite , which is an about @xmath17 deficit of the rate of @xmath18 observed in several short - baseline reactor neutrino experiments in comparison with that expected from the calculation of the reactor neutrino fluxes @xcite .",
    "2 .   the gallium neutrino anomaly @xcite , consisting in a short - baseline disappearance of @xmath2 measured in the gallium radioactive source experiments gallex @xcite and sage @xcite with a statistical significance of about @xmath19 .",
    "3 .   the lsnd experiment , in which a signal of short - baseline @xmath20 oscillations has been observed with a statistical significance of about @xmath21 @xcite .    the additional squared - mass difference @xmath22 requires the existence of at least one massive neutrino @xmath23 in addition to the three standard massive neutrinos @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 . since from the lep measurement of the invisible width of the @xmath24 boson we know that there are only three active neutrinos ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , in the flavor basis the additional massive neutrinos correspond to sterile neutrinos @xcite , which do not have standard weak interactions .",
    "sterile neutrinos are singlets of the standard model gauge symmetries which can couple to the active neutrinos through the lagrangian mass term . in practice",
    "there are bounds on the active - sterile mixing , but there is no bound on the number of sterile neutrinos and on their mass scales .",
    "therefore the existence of sterile neutrinos is investigated at different mass scales .",
    "this review is devoted to the discussion of sterile neutrinos at the ev scale , which can explain the indications in favor of short - baseline neutrino oscillations listed above . however , there are other very interesting possibilities which are under study : very light sterile neutrinos at a mass scale smaller than 0.1 ev , which could affect the oscillations of solar @xcite and reactor @xcite neutrinos ; sterile neutrinos at the kev scale , which could constitute warm dark matter according to the neutrino minimal standard model ( @xmath25msm ) @xcite ( see also the reviews in refs .",
    "@xcite ) ; sterile neutrinos at the mev scale @xcite ; sterile neutrinos at the electroweak scale @xcite or above it @xcite , whose effects may be seen at lhc and other high - energy colliders .",
    "let us also note that there are several interesting models with sterile neutrinos at different mass scales @xcite .",
    "the possible existence of sterile neutrinos is very interesting , because they are new particles which could give us precious information on the physics beyond the standard model ( see refs .",
    "the existence of light sterile neutrinos is also very important for astrophysics ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and cosmology ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this review",
    ", we consider 3 + 1 @xcite and 3 + 2 @xcite , neutrino mixing schemes in which there are one or two additional massive neutrinos at the ev scale and the masses of the three standard massive neutrinos are much smaller .",
    "we do not consider schemes in which @xmath26 is obtained with one or more very light ( or massless ) non - standard massive neutrinos and the three standard massive neutrinos have almost degenerate masses at the ev scale ( e.g. , the 1 + 3 , 1 + 3 + 1 and 2 + 3 schemes ) , because this possibility is strongly disfavored by cosmological measurements @xcite and by the experimental bound on neutrinoless double-@xmath0 decay ( assuming that massive neutrinos are majorana particles ; see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "in the 3 + 1 scheme , the effective probability of @xmath27 transitions in short - baseline experiments has the two - neutrino - like form @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the mixing matrix , @xmath30 is the source - detector distance , @xmath31 is the neutrino energy and @xmath32 .",
    "the electron and muon neutrino and antineutrino appearance and disappearance in short - baseline experiments depend on @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which determine the amplitude @xmath35 of @xmath36 transitions , the amplitude @xmath37 of @xmath38 disappearance , and the amplitude @xmath39 of @xmath40 disappearance .    since the oscillation probabilities of neutrinos and antineutrinos are related by a complex conjugation of the elements of the mixing matrix ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the effective probabilities of short - baseline @xmath41 and @xmath20 transitions are equal .",
    "hence , the 3 + 1 scheme can not explain a possible cp - violating difference of @xmath41 and @xmath20 transitions in short - baseline experiments . in order to allow this possibility",
    ", one must consider schemes with more than one sterile neutrino .",
    "in the 3 + 2 scheme there are four additional effective mixing parameters in short - baseline experiments : @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 $ ] ( see refs .",
    "since the complex phase @xmath46 appears with different signs in the effective 3 + 2 probabilities of short - baseline @xmath41 and @xmath20 transitions , it can generate measurable cp violations .",
    "several analyses of short - baseline neutrino oscillation data have been done after the discovery of the lsnd anomaly in the middle 90 s @xcite .",
    "the interest in short - baseline neutrino oscillations was renewed after the discovery in 2006 of the gallium neutrino anomaly @xcite and especially after the discovery in 2011 of the reactor antineutrino anomaly @xcite .

    "the main projects are listed in tab .  [",
    "tab : accelerator ] ( see also ref .",
    "they aim at checking the short - baseline @xmath20 lsnd signal in both neutrino ( @xmath41 ) and antineutrino ( @xmath20 ) mode ( see also the low - energy neutrino factory studies in refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    for accelerator experiments a crucial ingredient for reaching a robust result is the presence of `` near '' and `` far '' detectors ( as , for example , in the sbn @xcite experiment , where there will be even the `` middle '' microboone detector , albeit smaller than the near detector ) .",
    "the near detector provides a normalization of the neutrino flux and cross section which allows to measure the oscillations between the two detectors with small systematic uncertainty .",
    "figure  [ fig : fut - sem ] shows the sensitivities in the @xmath47@xmath48 plane of the sbn @xcite and nuprism @xcite accelerator experiments , which are expected to observe with a convincing statistical significance @xmath36 consistent with the lsnd signal if sterile neutrinos at the ev scale exist .",

    "[ tab : accelerator ] ( see also the nessie proposal in ref .",
    "@xcite and the low - energy neutrino factory studies in refs .",
    "@xcite ) can measure also the short - baseline @xmath3 and @xmath52 disappearance which is necessarily associated with @xmath36 oscillations .",
    "let us emphasize that it is important to measure short - baseline @xmath3 and @xmath52 disappearance for which so far there are only upper limits , whereas the short - baseline @xmath2 and @xmath18 disappearance associated with @xmath36 oscillations is given by the gallium and reactor anomalies .",
    "the consistency of the short - baseline neutrino oscillation scenario with any number of sterile neutrinos requires that also @xmath3 and @xmath52 disappearance must be observed @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : fut - smm ] shows the sensitivities in the @xmath49@xmath48 plane of the sbn @xcite and kpipe @xcite accelerator experiments .",
    "one can see that also @xmath40 disappearance should be observed if the short - baseline neutrino oscillations indicated by the lsnd , reactor and gallium anomalies really exist .      in principle",
    ", measuring the neutral - current scattering of active neutrinos is the best way to probe their disappearance into sterile states .",
    "however , neutral - current measurements are extremely difficult , because the only observable signal is the recoil of the target particle .    the signal can be enhanced at low neutrino energies by the coherent scattering on nuclei @xcite for which the cross section is approximately proportional to the square of the number of neutrons in the nucleus ( the proton contribution is suppressed by @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the weak mixing angle ) .",
    "this process has not been observed so far , but it is actively searched for @xcite . in the future it may lead to the direct measurement of active - sterile transitions @xcite .",
    "the most sensitive experiments on the search of the effects of neutrino masses in @xmath0 decay use the tritium decay process @xmath55 non - zero neutrino masses distort the measurable spectrum of the emitted electron . it is convenient to consider the kurie function ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the electron kinetic energy , @xmath58 is the @xmath59-value of the process , and @xmath60 is the heaviside step function .",
    "considering an experiment in which the energy resolution is such that @xmath61 for the three standard light neutrino masses ( @xmath62 ) , the kurie function can be approximated by @xmath63 with the effective light neutrino mass @xmath64 given by @xmath65 hence , @xmath64 causes a distortion of the end - point of the electron kinetic energy spectrum and a heavy nonstandard neutrino mass @xmath66 with @xmath67 can be measured by observing a kink of the kinetic energy spectrum of the emitted electron at @xmath68 below the end point @xcite .",
    "recently , the mainz @xcite and troitsk @xcite collaborations obtained upper bounds for the mixing factor @xmath33 for @xmath69 . in the 3 + 1 scheme",
    "these bounds imply an exclusion curve in the @xmath70@xmath48 plane for @xmath71 @xcite , which is well above the allowed region obtained in the pragmatic 3 + 1 global fit prglo shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : glo ] .    the experiment katrin @xcite , which is under construction and is scheduled to start data taking in 2016 , will aim to reach a sensitivity of @xmath72 at 90% c.l . for @xmath64 in five years of running .",
    "some studies have been performed to analyze the sensitivity of the katrin experiment to the effects of heavy sterile neutrinos with kev - scale masses @xcite and light ev - scale sterile neutrinos @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : fut - see ] shows the katrin sensitivity presented in ref .",
    "one can see that it covers a significant portion of the prglo allowed region .",
    "hence , there is a concrete possibility that katrin can observe the effect of @xmath73 if @xmath74 exists and both @xmath73 and @xmath33 are not too small .",
    "the implications of non - standard mainly sterile massive neutrinos at the ev scale for neutrinoless double-@xmath0 decay experiments have been studied by several authors @xcite .",
    "if massive neutrinos are majorana particles ( see the recent reviews in refs .",
    "@xcite ) , in the case of 3 + 1 mixing the rate of neutrinoless double-@xmath0 decay is proportional to the square of the effective majorana mass @xmath75 in this expression there are three completely unknown complex phases @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 which depend on the majorana phases in the neutrino mixing matrix .",
    "these unknown complex phases can generate cancellations between the different mass contributions .",
    "figure  [ fig : mbb ] shows the range of allowed values of @xmath79 as a function of the lightest neutrino mass in the cases of @xmath1 and 3 + 1 mixing with normal and inverted ordering of the three lightest neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 mixing parameters are those obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite and the sterile neutrino mixing is that obtained in the global pragmatic 3 + 1 prglo fit of short - baseline neutrino oscillation data discussed in section  [ sec : global ] .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : mbb ] one can see that the presence of an additional massive neutrinos at the ev scale can change dramatically the predictions for the possible range of values of @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "in the case of a normal @xmath1 mass hierarchy ( @xmath80 ) the value of @xmath79 is dominated by the contribution of @xmath74 , which implies that @xmath81 .",
    "this range of values of @xmath79 is larger than that predicted by the standard @xmath1 mixing in the case of a normal hierarchy and similar to that predicted in the case of an inverted hierarchy in the standard @xmath1 mixing scheme . on the other hand ,",
    "in the case of an inverted @xmath1 mass ordering there can be a complete cancellation between the contribution of @xmath74 and those of the three standard light neutrinos , leading to the disappearance of the lower limit for @xmath79 predicted by the standard @xmath1 mixing scheme .    the next generation of neutrinoless double - beta decay experiments ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) is planned to explore the range of @xmath79 between about @xmath82 and @xmath83 predicted by the standard @xmath1 mixing in the case of an inverted hierarchy .",
    "they are not expected to reach the range of @xmath79 between about @xmath84 and @xmath85 predicted by the standard @xmath1 mixing in the case of a normal hierarchy . from fig .",
    "[ fig : mbb ] it is clear that the predictions are dramatically changed in the 3 + 1 neutrino mixing scheme and a positive result in these experiments is guaranteed in the case of a normal mass hierarchy , whereas in the case of an inverted mass hierarchy the allowed range of @xmath79 goes from zero to about 0.1 ev .",
    "the reactor , gallium and lsnd anomalies can be explained by neutrino oscillations if the standard three - neutrino mixing paradigm is extended with the addition of light sterile neutrinos which can give us important information on the new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the global fits of short - baseline neutrino oscillation data in the framework of mixing schemes with one or more sterile neutrinos suffer from a tension between the results of appearance and disappearance short - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "this tension can be alleviated adopting the `` pragmatic approach '' advocated in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the anomalous miniboone low - energy excess of @xmath2-like events is neglected from the global analysis of short - baseline neutrino oscillation data .",
    "the cause of the miniboone low - energy excess is going to be investigated in the microboone experiment at fermilab @xcite .",
    "moreover , the cosmological data indicate a tension between the necessity to have a sterile neutrino mass at the ev scale and the expected full thermalization of the sterile neutrinos through active - sterile oscillations in the early universe @xcite . hence , the possible existence of light sterile neutrinos at the ev scale is controversial and needs new reliable experimental checks .",
    "the impressive program of new experiments reviewed in section  [ sec : perspectives ] gives us confidence that the question of the existence of the light sterile neutrinos indicated by the reactor , gallium and lsnd anomalies will be answered in a definitive way in the next years .    for neutrino physics",
    ", the discovery of the existence of light sterile neutrinos would open a rich field of experimental and theoretical research on the properties of the sterile neutrinos , their mixing with the active neutrinos and their role in neutrino experiments ( e.g. in solar @xcite , long - baseline @xcite , and atmospheric @xcite neutrino experiments ) in astrophysics ( e.g. in supernova neutrino experiments @xcite and indirect dark matter detection @xcite ) , high - energy cosmic neutrinos @xcite , and in cosmology ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "let us finally emphasize that the discovery of the existence of sterile neutrinos would be a major discovery which would have a profound impact not only on neutrino physics , but on our whole view of fundamental physics , because sterile neutrinos are elementary particles beyond the standard model .",
    "the existence of light sterile neutrinos would prove that there is new physics beyond the standard model at low - energies and their properties can give important information on this new physics . without any doubt , such a discovery would deserve a new nobel prize in physics .",
