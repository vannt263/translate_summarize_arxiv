    "most stars , both in the solar neighborhood and in young clusters are members of binary or multiple systems . yet , the formation and early evolution of binary and multiple stars is poorly constrained observationally , and not well understood theoretically .",
    "for instance , the fraction of wide binaries in dense star - forming regions such as the orion nebula cluster and ic  348 are comparable to that of field stars @xcite whereas the frequency of binaries is much higher among young stars in dispersed t  associations like taurus - auriga ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "predictions are that the binary fraction is higher among higher mass stars , and that brown dwarfs are never close companions to stars @xcite .    while past multiplicity surveys , using speckle imaging and adaptive optics on @xmath10-m class telescopes , have drawn attention to the ubiquity of binaries in star - forming regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , their limited contrast and angular resolution have left many key questions unanswered or only partially answered .",
    "for instance , the frequency of higher - order multiples is uncertain , and so is the frequency of very low - mass stellar and sub - stellar companions @xcite .",
    "multiple systems are probably common .    with adaptive optics on @xmath11-m class telescopes , it has become straightforward to detect all stellar and even all brown dwarf companions down to the deuterium - burning limit with separations of tens of au for nearby young stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite presented a census of wide binaries in cha  i that encompasses our sample while @xcite investigated circumstellar disks , including the effect of companions on disks , for a subsample of cha  i targets with available near - ir data .    among the issues we address in this work",
    "is the dependence of multiplicity on primary mass , i.e. , whether higher mass stars are more likely to be in binaries and multiples than their lower mass counterparts .",
    "an increase in wide binaries with increasing mass has been observed for both young stars and field dwarfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "although the source of dichotomy between ctts and wtts is currently unknown , the presence of non - accreting @xmath24myr old stars is surprising .",

    "second , we examined the radial velocity measurements for variations consistent with sb1s .",
    "we identified sb2 candidates as targets that have broadening functions with prominent multiple peaks that can not be accounted for by non - companion sources ( e.g. , see v826tau ; fig .",
    "[ fig : tau__v826taua+b ] ) .",
    "plausible non - companion sources include sky or moon contamination , and contribution from a known resolved companion .",
    "we discuss these influences below .",
    "an extra peak near the observer s rest frame could be attributed to possible contamination from moonlight or twilight sky .",
    "this occurs commonly in our data , since we did not correct for sky in our reduction ( see  [ sec : observations ] ) . to assess this contamination",
    ", we checked the angular distance of the target to the moon and the altitude of the sun below the horizon at the time the data were taken , and we inspected the raw data frames .",
    "additional peaks in the broadening function may be caused by light from nearby resolved companions .",
    "we collected information on known visual binaries by cross - referencing our target list with those of speckle and direct imaging surveys : for cha  i , we used @xcite , and for tau - aur we checked @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . to gauge the significance of the visual binaries on the broadening functions",
    ", we used the @xmath72 magnitudes and @xmath73-band flux ratios reported in the surveys to calculate corresponding @xmath74-band flux ratios .",
    "this calculation consists of the following eight steps :    1 .",
    "use the spectral type of the targets to estimate effective temperatures @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "2 .   with @xmath75 ,",
    "compute luminosities @xmath76 from the models of @xcite .",
    "3 .   with @xmath76 ,",
    "compute bolometric magnitudes @xmath77 .",
    "4 .   use the spectral type of the targets and the color - temperature relation of @xcite to compute the bolometric correction @xmath78 , and the @xmath79@xmath74 and @xmath79@xmath73 colors of the primary stars .",
    "combine the above to calculate the absolute @xmath74 and @xmath73 magnitudes of the primary stars .",
    "apply the reported @xmath72 magnitudes and @xmath73-band flux ratios of the systems to derive the absolute @xmath73 magnitudes of the companions .",
    "use these absolute @xmath73 magnitudes to estimate the corresponding absolute @xmath74 magnitudes by interpolating the color - temperature relation of @xcite .",
    "combine the derived absolute @xmath74 magnitudes of the primary stars and the companions to find the @xmath74-band flux ratios of the systems .",
    "obviously , the above calculation relies on numerous assumptions , and the resulting estimated @xmath74-band flux ratios are thus only approximate .",
    "however , they suffice for our purpose of gauging whether a significant contribution to the broadening function from a resolved companion is likely .",
    "our ability to identify sb2 candidates from the broadening functions is limited by several factors .",
    "first , the contribution of companions to the broadening function must be sufficiently large to discriminate them from their primary stars .",
    "the sb2 candidates we could identify had a flux ratio lower bound of @xmath21 .",
    "second , the radial velocity separation of component stars with similar @xmath80 must be large enough to distinguish each star in the broadening function .",
    "the minimum measurable velocity separation is equal to the sampling interval of @xmath62kms@xmath3 ; however , we find empirically the lower limit of the velocity separation for our identified sb2 candidates is @xmath81kms@xmath3 .",
    "note , resolved companions are generally in long - period orbits , and thus , the radial velocity separation between the host and the companion is usually small , and the peaks in the broadening function from the pair would likely overlap . moreover ,",
    "overlapping contributions from two sources would produce an additional sharp central peak in the broadening function , thus a lack of this feature excludes some targets with only two wide peaks , e.g. , t20 and hd283572 , from being identified as sb2s due to bad model fitting .",
    "third , the @xmath18 of the component stars with similar radial velocities must be large enough to distinguish each star in the broadening function .",
    "for example , see the broadening function of dftau in fig .  [",
    "fig : tau__dftaua+b ] , the two component stars have similar radial velocities and could only be distinguished because of the significant difference in @xmath18 between them . among applicable sb2 candidates ,",
    "the smallest difference between component star @xmath18 is @xmath82kms@xmath3 .",
    "we identified thirteen sb2s , four suspected sb2s , and four sb3s in our sample .",
    "of the thirteen sb2s , five show significant acceleration based on their broadening functions whereas the other eight display no remarkable radial velocity changes .",
    "we re - labeled these latter objects as long - period sb2s . for seven out of the eight long - period sb2s , resolved companions are likely the source of the secondary peaks in their broadening functions , and thus , they are also visual binaries",
    ". the one remaining long - period sb2 , rxj0443.4 + 1546 , could have a binary separation of a few au , which would be smaller than can be currently resolved by imaging techniques but large enough not to show a significant change in radial velocity over the time baseline of our observations .",
    "the sets of radial velocity measurements for all candidate and suspected sb2s , and sb3s are listed in tables  [ tbl : rvsb2 ] & [ tbl : rvsb3 ] .",
    "we identified sb1 candidates as targets that have radial velocity scatter that can not be accounted for by noise ( e.g. , see rxj0415.8 + 3100 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : tau__rxj0415.8 + 3100 ] ) .",
    "we consider not only measurement noise but also possible intrinsic noise from the star .",
    "of particular relevance are apparent radial velocity changes due to spots , which effectively attenuate light from part of the star .",
    "combined with rotation , this leads to apparent velocity changes on cycles connected to the rotation period of the star . to test the significance of the radial velocity changes of each target",
    ", we calculate several relevant statistics .",
    "first , to evaluate the overall radial velocity scatter of each target , we compute the @xmath39 statistic of the radial velocity measurements with the null hypothesis of constant velocity using the relation + @xmath83 + where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the radial velocities and measurement uncertainties of the target at epochs @xmath86 , respectively , and @xmath87 is the weighted mean of the radial velocity of the target .",
    "we would like to achieve a confidence level of @xmath88 that no single star is mistakenly identified as an sb1 in our sample .",
    "given that we have @xmath89 targets , this condition requires a confidence level of @xmath90 for correct identification of individual targets . for a typical target",
    "observed at four epochs , this implies that we require @xmath91 to identify a target as an sb1 .",
    "second , to estimate systematic noise for each target , we consider the measurements for each observing run separately .",
    "since each observing run is only a few days long , velocity changes of a few kms@xmath3 on this timescale are much more likely to be due to rotation than to orbits .",
    "specifically , for each target , we calculate the systematic noise during each observing run , + @xmath92 + where @xmath93 is the weighted standard deviation of the radial velocities for observing run @xmath94 , and @xmath95 is the weighted mean of the radial velocity errors for observing run @xmath94 .",

    "comparison between our sample and those of the field population is not straightforward because the surveys have different time baselines and companion mass sensitivities .",

    "one possibility is that primary mass is important for binaries with wide separations because of dynamical interactions within the cluster .",

    "moreover , the kinetic energy of a passing star must be greater than the gravitational binding energy of the binary for break up to occur .",

    "these separations are in the regime of imaging surveys .",
    "although scattering events are possible for binaries with separations of tens of au in cha  i and tau - aur , the likelihood of an encounter depends on the stellar densities of the star - forming regions .",
    "moreover , the interaction timescale @xmath203 is roughly equal to @xmath204 where @xmath42 is the encounter cross - sectional area @xmath205 , @xmath150 is the stellar density , and @xmath193 is the average relative velocity between stars . for a typical wide binary in cha  i and tau - aur , at current densities of @xmath206 @xcite ,",
    "the interaction timescale is of order a few gyr or longer .",
    "the interaction timescale only becomes comparable to the current cluster age for binaries with separations of @xmath207au .",
    "visual binaries with separations much less than this show a mass dependence .",
    "therefore , if dynamical interaction is a major source of the mass dependence of wide binaries , then those stars must have emerged from subgroups with stellar densities several orders of magnitude higher than their current sparse environment .",
    "there is observational evidence that stellar density may not solely influence the frequency of wide binaries .",
    "the wide binary frequency in the periphery of the onc is similar to that in the core , where stellar densities are two orders of magnitude higher @xcite . while this trend is not observed by @xcite , both wide binary frequencies in the onc",
    "are observed to be several times lower than those of chamaeleon  i and taurus - auriga .",
    "if the initial binary fractions in these regions were similar , we would expect a much higher number of binaries in the onc periphery than observed . aside from the dense subgroup scenario mentioned above ,",
    "one possible explanation is that the initial binary frequency differs significantly between star - forming regions .",
    "this suggests that the binary formation rate is influenced by environmental conditions",
    ".      one obvious source of stellar radial velocity fluctuations over time is a close companion .",
    "however , close companions are not the only plausible explanation for oscillatory radial velocity behaviour .",

    "however , real star spots do not affect all spectral features equally nor do they have identical impact at all optical depths . a technique such as line bisector analysis , which probes radial velocity bias at different depths ,",

    "the net effect of star spots on radial velocity measurements relies on the asymmetry that the spots produce on the stellar surface . in terms of contribution to radial velocity bias",
