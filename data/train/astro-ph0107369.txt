    "a luminous quasar in a high redshift universe has been supposed to inhabit a massive host galaxy in its forming phase .",
    "@xcite showed that this scenario can reproduce an observed evolution of luminosity function of agns / qsos well .",
    "more recently , @xcite showed the star formation history of the universe can also be accounted by this scenario with some assumptions for physical process of star formation and agn formation .",
    "the scenario is also supported by the linear correlation between a black hole mass at the center of a galaxy and a mass of a spheroid component of its host galaxy in the local universe ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus a luminous quasar at high redshift may be a site where burst star formation under which bulk of stellar population of a present - day massive elliptical galaxy formed is on - going .    in these several years , huge amount of molecular gas and dust have been found in quasars up to @xmath10 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcitea ; @xcite ; @xciteb ; @xcite ) .",
    "molecular gases have been also detected toward two radio galaxies at @xmath11 ( @xcite ) .",
    "these detections strongly suggest the presence of intense starburst in the host galaxies , and the inferred star formation rates in these systems are an order of 1000 @xmath8 yr@xmath4 , judging from the estimated masses of the molecular gas and the dust ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively ) .",
    "physical conditions of the molecular clouds can also be examined by multi - transition co observations ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . moreover ,",
    "some of these objects show the presence of two molecular gas components physically close each other ( @xcitea ; @xcite ) ; we may be witnessing a merging process and the star burst may be triggered by the interaction .",
    "therefore , a detection of a co emission from a higher redshift quasar provides us an opportunity to study starting epoch of galaxy formation , star formation properties of a galaxy in a forming phase , and a dynamical assembling process of a galaxy",
    ". it may be also possible to obtain a clue to examine whether a quasar appeared before formation of bulk of stars in a galaxy by co observations as well as submillimeter observations of quasars at the highest redshift .",
    "sdssp j104433.04@xmath1012502.2 ( or sdss 1044@xmath10125 for short ) is a quasar located at @xmath14 , which was the highest among quasars known at the time of the observation ( @xcite ) .",
    "this quasar is one of the most promising targets for co search , because ( 1 ) the continuum emission at 850@xmath15 m has been recently detected with a flux density of @xmath16 mjy by scuba on jcmt ( mcmahon , private communication ) .",
    "( 2 ) a rest - frame @xmath17-band absolute magnitude is estimated to be @xmath18 mag , which is the brightest among high-@xmath2 quasars and is comparable to those toward which co emission was detected ( @xciteb ) .",
    "( 3 ) the rest - frame uv spectrum shows a broad `` weak''-type profile of ly@xmath19 ; co and dust are tend to be detected in such quasars ( @xciteb ) .",
    "( 4 ) a lyman limit system at @xmath20 is seen in the spectrum of the quasar ; the presence of the lyman limit system at such a close redshift is also a common feature seen in high-@xmath2 quasars toward which co emission is detected .",
    "motivated by these , we made co(@xmath0 ) observations of the quasar aimed at pushing the co detection back to the earlier universe . throughout this paper , we adopt a cosmological parameter set of @xmath21 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "the observations were executed in total 10 nights , 25th to 29th november 2000 , and 20th to 24th december 2000 , using nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) of nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) .",
    "the array configuration for both observations was d , which is the most compact configuration of nma , giving an angular resolution ( half - power beam size ) of 7@xmath24 at the observed frequency .",
    "the field of view was @xmath370@xmath25 centered on the quasar .",
    "fan et al .",
    "( 2000 ) estimated the redshift of sdss 1044@xmath10125 as 5.80 @xmath26 0.02 , using observed wavelengths of o @xmath27 + si @xmath28 @xmath291302 and si @xmath30 + o @xmath30 ] @xmath291400 emission lines .",
    "it is known that high - ionization rest - frame uv emission lines such as si @xmath30 observed in quasars at @xmath32 show blueshifts of several hundred km s@xmath4 or larger with respect to systemic redshifts ( @xcite ) .",
    "we adopted 500 km s@xmath4 for the amount of the blueshift and obtained an estimated systemic redshift of 5.811 .",
    "the difference between the observed frequencies of co(@xmath0 ) emission from objects at the redshifts of 5.800 and 5.811 are @xmath3 165 mhz , which is very much small as compared with a wide coverage of the spectrometer used ( 1024 mhz , @xmath33 km s@xmath4 ) .",
    "the central frequency for the first observing run ( november ) was 101.52 ghz , the expected frequency of co(@xmath0 ) emission from the object located at @xmath34 . among the data taken in the first observing run",
    ", some data showed a hint of the presence of an emission feature around 101.8 ghz , hence we slightly shifted the observed frequency for the second observing run ( december ) .",
    "the central frequency was set to be 101.76 ghz .",
    "the frequency range covered by both observing runs was @xmath3780 mhz ( about 2300 km s@xmath4 or a redshift ranging from 5.78 to 5.83 ) .",
    "in general the weather conditions were fairly good , except for four nights , when the atmospheric phase stability was not always good .",
    "the system noise temperature ( ssb ) was @xmath3400 k during the observations .",
    "we used a quasar j1058 + 015 as a reference calibrator , which is located very close ( @xmath35 ) to the quasar .",
    "data reduction and analysis were made using uvproc2 developed by nro , and aips developed by nrao , usa . data reduction was made independently by two of the authors ( ii and kn ) , by employing a different selection criterion for quality of the data .",
    "severely judged the quality of the data and discarded low quality data such as those taken under a relatively bad atmospheric condition or at low elevation .",
    "i.i . adopted a relatively loose criterion for data quality and included data of all 10 days , and the resulting total effective on - source time was @xmath3 36 hours .",
    "there is no distinct difference between the resulting two spectra at the quasar position , except for a rather poorer signal - to - noise ratio in the severe criterion case .",
    "we also examined the two dirty channel maps and found no significant difference at and around the quasar .",
    "we will use the latter result below .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)figure1a.eps ( 80mm,80mm)figure1b.eps ( 80mm,80mm)figure1c.eps    in figure [ fig1 ] we present spectra at the optical position of the quasar with a resolution of 40 mhz ( @xmath3 120 km s@xmath4 ) . figure [ fig1](a ) and ( b ) show the spectra obtained in the first observing run and in the second one , respectively .",
    "note that the observed frequency range for the two runs is slightly different from each other .",
    "for each spectrum , data of five - days are combined .",
    "resulting rms noise at a 40 mhz bin is 3.2 mjy beam@xmath4 and 2.7 mjy beam@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "there is no significant emission feature appeared in both spectra .",
    "figure [ fig1](c ) shows a spectrum made by combining 10-days data .",
    "only the frequency range common to both observations is plotted , and a typical rms noise is 2.1 mjy beam@xmath4 . within the reduced rms noise level , figure [ fig1](c )",
    "indicates no significant emission feature .",
    "although we also checked spectra with different frequency resolutions , we could not find any significant sign of emission lines .",
    "we carefully examined the channel maps of each observing run and combined data with different channel binings .",
    "there are some `` spikes '' in the field around the quasar which appeared in data obtained taken in particular one or two days .",
    "some of them remain in combined data .",
    "we consider they are spurious noises , since none of such features appears throughout the other observing days .        where @xmath39 is the speed of light , @xmath40 the boltzmann constant , @xmath41 the luminosity distance to the object , @xmath42 the rms noise flux density ( 2.1 mjy beam@xmath4 for a frequency range 101.28 ghz to 101.99 ghz ) , @xmath43 the velocity resolution ( 120 km s@xmath4 ) , @xmath44 the assumed velocity width of the emission line ( 250 km s@xmath4 ) , @xmath45 the rest - frame central frequency observed , and @xmath2 the redshift of the object .",
    "the 3@xmath36 upper limit of the co(@xmath0 ) luminosity of sdss1044@xmath10125 is thus derived to be 2.8 @xmath5 k",
    "km s@xmath4 pc@xmath6 .",
    "if we adopt a co - to - h@xmath46 conversion factor of 4.5 @xmath8 ( k km s@xmath4 pc@xmath47 ( e.g. , solomon et al . 1992 ) , the upper limit on the molecular gas mass is estimated to be @xmath48 @xmath8 .",
    "the co luminosity upperlimits for the frequency ranges covered by just one observing run are 4.2 @xmath5 k km s@xmath4 pc@xmath6 in 101.04 ghz to 101.28 ghz , and 3.5 @xmath5 k km s@xmath4 pc@xmath6 in 101.992 ghz to 102.272 ghz",
    ".    we can now compare the values with those detected in high redshift ( @xmath49 ) quasars .",
    "since the co(@xmath50 ) and co(@xmath514 ) flux densities of br1202@xmath10725 at @xmath10 are very similar to each other ( @xcitea ) , it would be reasonable to regard that the co(@xmath0 ) flux density of the object is close to that of co(@xmath52 ) emission ( 9.3 mjy ) .",
    "then the co(@xmath0 ) luminosity of br1202@xmath10725 is estimated to be 5.1 @xmath5 k km s@xmath4 pc@xmath6 .",
    "( we also suppose that the line width of 220 @xmath26 74 km s@xmath4 does not change with the transitions . )",
    "the upper limit of co(@xmath0 ) luminosity of sdss1044@xmath10125 is slightly smaller than that of br1202@xmath10725 .",
    "co(@xmath52 ) emission from bri1335@xmath10417 at @xmath53 ( @xcite ) and from bri0952@xmath10115 at @xmath53 ( @xcite ) are detected . as is the case for br1202@xmath10725 ,",
    "if we suppose the co(@xmath0 ) flux densities of them are close to the co(@xmath52 ) flux densities ( peak flux of 6mjy , velocity width of 420 @xmath26 60 km s@xmath4 for bri1335@xmath10417 , 4mjy , 230 @xmath26 30 km s@xmath4 for bri0952@xmath10115 ) , then the co(@xmath0 ) luminosities for bri1335@xmath10417 and bri0952@xmath10115 are @xmath54 and @xmath55 k km s@xmath4 pc@xmath6 , respectively . sdss1044@xmath10125 is less luminous than bri1335@xmath10417 , though our 3@xmath36 upper limit is slightly larger than the co luminosity of bri0952@xmath10115 .",
    "note , however , that there is a possibility of amplification by gravitional lensing for these quasars , especially for bri0952@xmath10115 .",
    "much deeper co observations would be required to discuss the amount of the molecular gas in this object .",
