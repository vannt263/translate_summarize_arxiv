    "persistent topology consists in the study of the properties of filtered topological spaces . from the very beginning",
    ", it has been applied to shape comparison @xcite . in this context",
    ", data are frequently represented by continuous @xmath0-valued functions defined on a topological space @xmath1 . as simple examples among many others",
    ", these functions can describe the coloring of a 3d object , the coordinates of the points in a planar curve , or the grey - levels in a x - ray ct image .",
    "each continuous function @xmath4 is called a _ filtering function _ and naturally induces a ( multi)filtration on @xmath1 , made by the sublevel sets of @xmath5 .",
    "persistent topology allows to analyse the data represented by each filtering function by examining how much the topological properties of its sublevel sets `` persist '' when we go through the filtration .",
    "the main mathematical tool to perform this analysis is given by persistent homology @xcite .",
    "this theory describes the birth and death of @xmath6-dimensional holes when we move along the considered filtration of the space @xmath1 .",
    "when the filtering function takes its values in @xmath7 we can look at it as a time , and the distance between the birthdate and deathdate of a hole is defined to be its _",
    "persistence_. the more persistent is a hole , the more important it is for shape comparison , since holes with small persistence are usually due to noise .",
    "an important property of classical persistent homology consists in the fact that if a self - homeomorphism @xmath8 is given , then the filtering functions @xmath9 can not be distinguished from each other by computing the persistent homology of the filtrations induced by @xmath5 and @xmath10 .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , this is a relevant issue in the applications where the functions @xmath9 can not be considered equivalent .",
    "this happens , e.g. , when each filtering function @xmath11 describes a grey - level image , since the images respectively described by @xmath5 and @xmath10 may have completely different appearances .",
    "a simple instance of this problem is illustrated in figure  [ letters ] .",
    "represented by functions @xmath12 from @xmath13 to the real numbers .",
    "each function @xmath14 describes the grey level at each point of the topological space @xmath13 , with reference to the considered instance of the letter @xmath15 .",
    "black and white correspond to the values @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively ( so that light grey corresponds to a value close to @xmath17 ) . in spite of the differences between the shapes of the considered letters , the persistent homology of the functions",
    "@xmath12 is the same in every degree.,width=207 ]    therefore , a natural question arises : how can we adapt persistent homology in order to prevent invariance with respect to the group @xmath3 of all self - homeomorphisms of the topological space @xmath1 , maintaining just the invariance under the action of the self - homeomorphisms that belong to a proper subgroup of @xmath3 ?",
    "for example , the comparison of the letters illustrated in figure  [ letters ] should require just the invariance with respect to the group of similarities of @xmath13 , since they all are equivalent with respect to the group @xmath18 .",
    "we point out that depicted letters are constructed from thick lines and therefore have some width in opposite to the concept of geometrical lines .",
    "one could think of solving the previous problem by using other filtering functions , possibly defined on different topological spaces .",
    "for example , we could extract the boundaries of the letters in figure  [ letters ] and consider the distance from the center of mass of each boundary as a new filtering function .",
    "this approach presents some drawbacks :    1 .",
    "it `` forgets '' most of the information contained in the image @xmath19 that we are considering , confining itself to examine the boundary of the letter represented by @xmath20 .",
    "if the boundary is computed by taking a single level of @xmath20 , this is also in contrast with the general spirit of persistent homology .",
    "it usually requires an extra computational cost ( e.g. , to extract the boundaries of the letters in our previous example ) .",
    "3 .   it can produce a different topological space for each new filtering function ( e.g. , the letters of the alphabet can have non - homeomorphic boundaries ) . working with several topological spaces instead of",
    "just one can be a disadvantage .",
    "it is not clear how we can translate the invariance that we need into the choice of new filtering functions defined on new topological spaces .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present a possible solution for the previously described problem .",
    "it is based on a dual approach to the invariance with respect to a subgroup @xmath2 of @xmath3 , and consists in changing the direct study of the group @xmath2 into the study of how the operators that are invariant under the action of @xmath2 act on classical persistent homology .",
    "this change of perspective reveals interesting mathematical properties , allowing to treat @xmath2 as a variable in our applications .",
    "according to this method , the shape properties and the invariance group can be determined separately , depending on our task .",
    "the operators that we consider in this paper act on the space of admissible filtering functions and , in some sense , can be interpreted as the `` glasses '' we use to look at the data .",
    "their use allows to combine persistent homology and the invariance with respect to the group @xmath2 , extending the range of application of classical persistent homology to the cases in which we are interested in @xmath2-invariance rather than in @xmath3-invariance .",
    "the idea of applying operators to filtering functions before computing persistent homology has been already considered in previous papers .",
    "for example , in @xcite convolutions have been used to get a bound for the norm of persistence diagrams of a diffusing function .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite scale space persistence has been shown useful to detect critical points of a function by examining the evolution of their homological persistence values through the scale space . as for combining persistent homology and transformation groups , the interest in measuring the invariance of a signal with respect to a group of translations ( i.e. the study of its periodicity or quasi - periodicity ) has been studied in @xcite , using embedding operators .",
    "however , our approach requires to consider just a particular kind of operators ( i.e. non - expanding @xmath2-invariant operators on the set of admissible filtering functions ) , and faces the more general problem of adapting persistent homology to _ any _ group of self - homeomorphisms of a topological space .    for another approach to this problem , using quite a different method , we refer the reader to @xcite .      after choosing a set @xmath21 of admissible filtering functions from the topological space @xmath1 to @xmath7 , and a subgroup @xmath2 of @xmath3",
    ", we consider the set @xmath22 of all non - expanding @xmath2-invariant operators @xmath23 .",
    "basically , our idea consists in comparing two functions @xmath24 by computing the supremum of the bottleneck distances between the classical persistence diagrams of the filtering functions @xmath25 and @xmath26 , varying @xmath27 in @xmath22 . in our paper",
    "we prove that this approach is well - defined , @xmath2-invariant , stable and computable ( under suitable assumptions ) .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ setting ] we introduce some concepts that will be used in the paper and recall some basic facts about persistent homology . in section  [ main_results ]",
    "we prove our main results concerning the theoretical properties of our method ( theorems  [ stabilityofd ] , [ maintheoremforg ] and  [ fiscompact ] ) . in section  [ experiments ] we illustrate the application of our technique to an experiment concerning 1d - signals .",
    "in section  [ towards ] a possible application to image retrieval is outlined .",
    "a short discussion concludes the paper .",
    "let us consider a ( non - empty ) triangulable metric space @xmath1 with nontrivial homology in degree @xmath6 .",
    "this last assumption is always satisfied for @xmath28 and unrestrictive for @xmath29 , since we can embed @xmath1 in a larger triangulable space @xmath30 with nontrivial homology in degree @xmath6 , and substitute @xmath1 with @xmath30 .",
    "let @xmath31 be the set of all continuous functions from @xmath1 to @xmath7 , endowed with the topology induced by the sup - norm @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath33 be a topological subspace of @xmath31 , containing at least the set of all constant functions .",
    "the functions in the topological space @xmath33 will be called _ admissible filtering functions on @xmath1_.    we assume that a subgroup @xmath2 of the group @xmath3 of all homeomorphisms from @xmath1 onto @xmath1 is given , acting on the set @xmath21 by composition on the right ( i.e. , the action of @xmath34 takes each function @xmath35 to the function @xmath36 ) .",
    "we do not require @xmath2 to be a proper subgroup of @xmath3 , so the equality @xmath37 can possibly hold .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath2 is a topological group with respect to the topology of uniform convergence . indeed",
    ", we can check that if two sequences @xmath38 converge to @xmath39 and @xmath40 in @xmath2 , respectively , then the sequence @xmath41 converges to @xmath42 in @xmath2 . furthermore ,",
    "if a sequence @xmath43 converge to @xmath40 in @xmath2 , then the sequence @xmath44 converges to @xmath45 in @xmath2 .",
    "we also notice that if two sequences @xmath46 in @xmath21 and @xmath2 are given , converging to @xmath5 in @xmath21 and to @xmath40 in @xmath2 , respectively , we have that @xmath47 .",
    "since @xmath48 converges uniformly to @xmath40 in @xmath2 and @xmath5 is uniformly continuous on the compact space @xmath1 , @xmath49 .",
    "moreover , @xmath50 , due to the invariance of the sup - norm under composition of the function inside the norm with homeomorphisms .",
    "since @xmath51 converges uniformly to @xmath5 in @xmath21 , @xmath52 . hence @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , the right action of @xmath55 on the set @xmath21 is continuous .",
    "if @xmath56 is a subset of @xmath3 , the set @xmath57 will be denoted by the symbol @xmath58 . obviously , @xmath59 .",
    "we can consider the natural pseudo - distance @xmath60 on the space @xmath21 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) :    [ defdg ] the pseudo - distance @xmath61 is defined by setting @xmath62 it is called the _ ( @xmath17-dimensional ) natural pseudo - distance associated with the group @xmath2 acting on @xmath21_.    the term `` @xmath17-dimensional '' refers to the fact that the filtering functions are real - valued .",
    "the concepts considered in this paper can be easily extended to the case of @xmath0-valued filtering functions , by substituting the absolute value in @xmath7 with the max - norm @xmath63 in @xmath0 .",
    "however , the use of @xmath0-valued filtering functions would require the introduction of a technical machinery that is beyond the purposes of our research ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite ) , in order to adapt the bottleneck distance to the new setting .",
    "therefore , for the sake of simplicity , in this paper we will just consider the @xmath17-dimensional case .",
    "we observe that the max - norm distance @xmath64 on @xmath21 , defined by setting @xmath65 is just the natural pseudo - distance @xmath60 in the case that @xmath2 is the trivial group @xmath66 , containing only the identity homeomorphism and acting on @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , the definition of @xmath60 immediately implies that if @xmath67 and @xmath68 are subgroups of @xmath3 acting on @xmath21 and @xmath69 , then @xmath70 for every @xmath71 . as a consequence ,",
    "the following double inequality holds , for every subgroup @xmath2 of @xmath3 and every @xmath71 ( see also theorem 5.2 in @xcite ) : @xmath72    [ weneedagroup ] the proof that @xmath60 is a pseudo - metric _ does _ use the assumption that @xmath2 is a group , and we can give a simple example of a subset @xmath56 of @xmath3 for which the function @xmath73 is not a pseudo - distance on @xmath21 . in order to do that , let us set @xmath74 , and consider the set @xmath75 containing just the identity @xmath76 and the counterclockwise rotation @xmath77 of @xmath78 radians .",

    "the rationale of using the natural pseudo - distance is that pattern recognition is usually based on comparing properties that are described by functions defined on a topological space .",
    "these properties are often the only accessible data , implying that every discrimination should be based on them .",
    "the fundamental assumption is that two objects can not be distinguished if they share the same properties with respect to a given observer ( cf .",

    "* @xmath499 . * @xmath500 .",

    ". the reader can easily verify that our twelve operators are non - expansive and @xmath2-invariant , when @xmath2 is the group of all isometries of @xmath13 .",
    "we look for the most similar images to three images from the dataset . in each of the figures [ exa ] , [ exb ] and [ exc ] we present the three images that have the smallest computed pseudo - distance with respect to a query image .",
    "[ remimages ] due to the randomness of the method we used to construct our images , it is quite unlikely that our dataset contains two identical ( or even nearly identical ) images , especially when the number of bumps that appear in the images is @xmath501 or @xmath502 .",
    "we would like to underline that our goal is not to find images that are equal to each other , but images that resemble each other with respect to the group of isometries .",
    "[ remmeaning ] we intentionally decided to build our dataset by producing images that do not encode meaningful information for humans . otherwise , the qualitative results would be biased by a priori knowledge of the image content . in our research",
    "we focus on topological and geometrical properties , and neglect the perceptual aspects of image comparison .",
    "therefore , we decided not to use standard datasets from image comparison and retrieval projects .",
    "in our paper we have described a method to combine persistent homology and the invariance with respect to a given group @xmath2 of homeomorphisms , acting on a set @xmath21 of filtering functions .",
    "this technique allows us to treat @xmath2 as a variable in our problem , and to distinguish functions that are not directly distinguishable in the classical setting .",
    "our approach is based on a new pseudo - distance depending on a set of non - expansive @xmath2-invariant operators , that approximates the natural pseudo - distance in the limit .",
    "some relevant questions remain open :    * how can we choose the @xmath2-invariant operators in order to get the best possible results , depending on the set @xmath21 and the group @xmath2 ?",
    "how large should the set of operators be ? is it possible to build a dictionary of operators to be used for a specific group ? * how could our theoretical results be applied to problems in shape comparison ?",
    "* how could our approach benefit from the use of multidimensional persistence ?",
    "our first experiments suggest that the introduced method is pretty robust , taking advantage from the stability of persistent homology .",
    "we hope that this property can open the way to new applications of the concept of persistence , in presence of constraints concerning the invariance of our data .    in conclusion",
    ", we would also like to consider the problem of formalizing the framework that we have described in this paper . in our approach , each object belonging to a given dataset is seen as a collection @xmath503 of continuous functions .",
    "these functions represent the measurements made on the object .",
    "no attempt is made to define the objects in a direct way , according to the idea that each object is accessible just via acts of measurement ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "however , the measurements @xmath503 are not directly used by the observer that has to judge about similarity and dissimilarity .",
    "indeed , perception usually changes the signals @xmath503 into several new ( and usually simpler ) collections @xmath504 of data .",
    "this passage is given by some operators @xmath505 , taking each function @xmath506 into a new function @xmath507 .",
    "in the approach that we have presented , these operators are supposed to be @xmath2-invariant and non - expansive , because perception usually benefits of some invariance and quantitative constraint . in other words ,",
    "the observer is represented by an ordered family @xmath508 of suitable operators , each one acting on a set @xmath509 of admissible signals . as a consequence ,",
    "two objects in the dataset can be distinguished if and only if the observer is endowed with an operator @xmath27 , changing the corresponding signals into two new signals that are not equivalent with respect to the invariance group .",
