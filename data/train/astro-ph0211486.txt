    "sextans a ( ddo 75 ) is a dwarf irregular galaxy , which lies in a small group of galaxies including ngc 3109 , sextans b , and the antlia dwarf at a distance of approximately @xmath3 mpc .",
    "the group appears to not be bound to the local group @xcite , making it the nearest group of galaxies to us .",
    "cepheids were discovered in the galaxy by @xcite , who calculated a distance modulus of @xmath4 .",
    "later work @xcite improved the photometry and adjusted the cepheid magnitudes by over half a magnitude fainter , a change that was largely counteracted by revisions to the period - luminosity relation .",
    "@xcite reobserved the five sandage & carlson cepheids and added observations of five new cepheids in sextans a. they derived a distance modulus of @xmath5 based on a distance modulus of 18.5 for the lmc .",
    "@xcite added new , single epoch photometry of the six cepheids with periods between 10 and 25 days and calculated a distance modulus of @xmath6 as well as an rgb tip distance modulus of @xmath7 .    the distance",
    "to sextans a is important for three reasons .",
    "first , as noted above , the galaxy is part of the antlia - sextans group , which may or may not be bound to the local group .",
    "improved measurements of the distances of the four members should help to clarify this issue .",
    "second , accurate distances to all of the nearest galaxies are important for an accurate characterization of the local mass distribution and the degree to which galaxy distributions follow mass distributions ( e.g. , peebles et al . 2001 , ekholm et al .",
    "2001 , and references therein ) . perhaps of greatest interest",
    "is that sextans a is one of the lowest metallicity objects in which classical cepheids have been discovered ( with hii region abundances of 12 + log[o / h ] @xmath8 7.6 skillman , kennicutt , & hodge 1989 ; pilyugin 2001 ) .",
    "thus , observationally studies of the variable stars in sextans a can shed light on the question of the metallicity dependence of the cepheid distance scale ( e.g. , kennicutt et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "hst observations permit a more accurate measurement of the distance of sextans a. not only does the increased resolution permit more accurate photometry of the brighter distance indicators such as the rgb tip , but the deeper photometry allows the red clump position to be measured for the first time .",
    "additionally , our study of leo a @xcite indicates that we should find large numbers of short - period cepheids in low - metallicity star - forming galaxies ( such as sextans a ) ; accurate photometry of these objects is difficult from the ground but lies easily within the capabilities of hst and can potentially provide a new distance measurement .",
    "this paper is the second in our study of sextans a based on deep wfpc2 images . in paper i @xcite , we used the blue helium - burning ( bheb ) stars to examine its recent star formation history . in this paper",
    ", we use the 3-day observation baseline to examine the variable star population .",
    "section 2 describes our photometry and identification of variables . in section 3 , we examine the short - period cepheid population and determine the distance to sextans a. section 4 is a comparison of distance moduli to sextans a and other dwarf galaxies , as determined using a variety of standard candles .",
    "the observations were described in detail in paper i. summarizing briefly , the data consist of 24 pairs of 1200 second images .",
    "sixteen of the pairs were taken through the f814w filter , eight through f555w .",
    "data were taken with four dithering positions , with one quarter of the observations ( four pair of f814w images and two pair of f555w images ) made at each .",
    "a pair of f656n images was also taken , but was not used for our variable star work and thus will not be referenced again in this paper .",
    "the total baseline of observations was slightly over 3 days .",
    "the data were obtained from the stsci archive using on the fly calibration , and thus were pipeline - calibrated using the best available calibration images at the time of retrieval .",
    "reduction and photometry was made with the hstphot package @xcite .",
    "for this variable star study , each pair of images was cosmic ray cleaned and combined , to give effective 2400 second images .",
    "additionally , a deep f555w frame at the first pointing was created to provide a reference image for alignment . the mosaic of this image is shown in figure [ figimage ] .",
    "photometry was obtained on the 24 images simultaneously , producing photometry for all epochs for a common list of stars .",
    "calibration to the wfpc2 flight system was made using hstphot - produced cte corrections and calibrations @xcite .",
    "figure [ figcmd ] shows the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) for all well - photometered stars ( those with @xmath9 , @xmath10sharpness@xmath11 , total signal - to - noise of at least 5 , and observed in both filters ) .",
    "variable star candidates were identified first using a series of automated cuts , similar to those used in our study of ic 1613 @xcite . the star had to meet each of the following five criteria , testing the photometry , variability , and periodicity .",
    "first , the object had to be a well - photometered star . while it is possible for a variable star to be part of a blend , our psf - fitting photometry attempts to fit the profile to that of a single star and",
    "thus is unreliable for photometering blends .",
    "our next cuts were intended to eliminate non - variable or weakly - variable stars .",
    "the simplest requirement was that the rms magnitude scatter , @xmath12 had to be 0.14 magnitudes or greater .",
    "next , the overall reduced @xmath13 , @xmath14 had to be 3.0 or greater .",
    "these two cuts eliminate stars that are weakly variable and those for which the photometry signal - to - noise is insufficient to discern variability .",
    "we also clipped 1/3 of the extreme points and required that the recalculated reduced @xmath13 exceed 0.5 ; this was intended to eliminate non - variable stars with a few bad points .",
    "the final test was a modified lafler - kinman algorithm @xcite , which tests for periodicity .",
    "this was implemented by computing @xmath15 for periods between 0.1 and 4.0 days .",
    "the @xmath15 parameter is calculated by determining the light curve for a trial period and using the equation @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the number of exposures for a given filter , @xmath18 is the magnitude at phase @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the mean magnitude . if the trial period is the correct period , each magnitude @xmath18 will be close to the adjacent magnitude @xmath21 , giving a value of @xmath15 that decreases as @xmath22 . if the trial period is incorrect , there will be less correlation and consequently larger values of @xmath15 . because we had data in two filters",
    ", we combined the @xmath15 values with : @xmath23 for a star to pass the periodicity test , its minimum value of @xmath15 had to be 0.85 or less .",
    "our photometry identified 39947 total objects , of which 33681 were well - photometered stars and 110 passed our automatic selection process .",
    "nine of these stars appeared to not be clean detections upon manual examination of the images and were removed from the list .",
    "each of the remaining stars was examined manually and subjectively graded based on its quality .",
    "a quality value of 4 means that the variable had clean light curves in both filters , the f555w and f814w light curves were in phase , and the period had no ambiguity .",
    "lower quality values were assigned to variables that failed to meet one or more of these criteria . only those variables with quality of 3 or 4 were kept ; 82 passed this test .    to compute mean magnitudes , we computed a phase - weighted average using @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the phase and @xmath18 is the magnitude at each point along the light curve .",
    "these values , still in wfpc2 f555w and f814w magnitudes , were then transformed to standard @xmath26 and @xmath27 by application of color terms .",
    "complete photometry for all variable stars is shown in table [ tab_phot ] and summarized in table [ tabvars ] ; light curves are shown in figure [ figlcs ] .",
    "although location on the cmd was not a criterion , all of our variable stars were found near the expected location of short - period cepheids  brighter and bluer than the red clump .",
    "figure [ figvcmd ] shows the sextans a cmd , with the variable stars highlighted .",
    "the apparent horizontal extensions of the cepheid population at @xmath28 are artifacts of poor phase coverage in f555w , explained in the next section .",
    "it should be emphasized that our detection efficiency was not 100% .",
    "thus we can not rule out the existence of population ii cepheids , nor are we confident that the `` non - variable '' stars falling within the instability strip are not , in fact , variables that were not detected .",
    "additionally , while the cmd from combined photometry is 50% complete to @xmath29 , the single epoch signal - to - noise of stars below @xmath30 is such that detection of fainter periodic variables , such as rr lyraes , would have been extremely difficult .",
    "for example , the signal - to - noise of our individual epoch photometry at the expected location of rr lyraes is @xmath31 in @xmath27 ; thus a variable at that magnitude would have to have an rms variability of @xmath32 magnitudes in @xmath27 to pass all of our variability tests .",
    "since the primary goal of these observations was the obtaining of deep photometry , the program was not carried out in a way that would maximize the phase coverage .",
    "thus , a variable star with one period may have excellent coverage of its light curve while one with another period may have poor coverage .",
    "figure [ figdphase ] shows the maximum gap in our phase coverage as a function of period , assuming that the star was measured at every epoch .",
    "while the f814w observations consist of 16 epochs and thus give the better coverage , we will have poor phase coverage of any variable whose period is between 0.8 and 1.1 days .",
    "for such a star , all 16 f814w observations would cover only about 40% of the light curve , while the 8 f555w observations cover about 50% .",
    "thus our detection efficiency will suffer , since such a star may not show sufficient variability over the phase range included in our observations to trigger our @xmath13 flag .",
    "additionally , if such a variable is recovered , the absence of half the light curve prevents an accurate mean magnitude determination and creates ambiguity between periods of a day and half a day . fortunately , the color of such a star should be measured acceptably since both light curves would have their gaps at close to the same phases .",
    "in addition to detection efficiency , poor phase coverage affects our period and mean magnitude determinations .",
    "eight stars could have been fit with either one - day or half - day light curves ; fortunately all such stars could be identified using their locations in the period - luminosity diagram . the mean magnitude errors are more problematic , since the lack of half the light curve can bias the calculation in either direction if the star is observed only near maximum or minimum brightness . for stars with periods of about one day , this affected the mean magnitudes in both filters similarly , since the same phases were observed in both filters .",
    "however , for stars with periods of about 1.2 days , the phase coverage in f814w was excellent ( maximum phase gap of 0.1 ) while that in f555w was poor ( maximum phase gap of 0.6 ) .",
    "five such stars were observed only near minimum in f555w ; these are the five that appear to be on top of the red clump in figure [ figvcmd ] ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) . correcting for this measurement error , we find that the five are , on average , 0.4 magnitudes brighter in @xmath26 ( and thus bluer ) than our measurement .",
    "similarly , four 1.2-day variables were observed exclusively near maximum in f555w , creating the apparent blue extension at the same @xmath27 magnitude .",
    "figure [ figpl ] shows our period - luminosity ( p - l ) relations in @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath27 relation is significantly sharper for two reasons ",
    "better phase coverage in f814w allows for a better measurement of the mean magnitude , and the p - l relation has less scatter in redder bands .",
    "we note that one of the fundamental - mode pulsators ( c4-v24 ) has a period of only @xmath35 days ; such objects were also seen in our variable star study of leo a @xcite .",
    "we note that the gap between c4-v24 and the one with the next - shortest period ( c1-v07 ; @xmath36 days ) is the result of our poor phase coverage in that period range as described in the previous section . as with the three @xmath37 day cepheids in leo",
    "a , we believe c4-v24 to be a _ bona fide _ classical cepheid rather than an rr lyrae or anomalous cepheid .",
    "because the p - l relations have have steeper slopes at short periods than at long periods @xcite , we calculated relations using short - period ( @xmath38 day ) cepheids ( 638 fundamental - mode and 611 first - overtone pulsators ) from the ogle smc cepheid database @xcite : @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 assuming an smc distance modulus of @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "converting to the reddening - free parameter @xmath44 , the relations become @xmath45 @xmath46 the true distance modulus is thus given by @xmath47 , allowing us to measure a distance for each sextans a cepheid . averaging the individual distances of our cepheids ,",
    "we measure true distance moduli of @xmath48 from 39 fundamental - mode cepheids and @xmath49 from 43 first - overtone cepheids . for the complete sample of 82 cepheids , we measure a true distance modulus of @xmath50 .",
    "additionally , we measure a mean extinction of @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the agreement with the value of @xmath53 measured from the maps of @xcite supports our estimate of the extinction necessary for the distance measurement .",
    "fitting p - l relations ( slopes and zero - points ) to the sextans a data , we find that the slopes are consistent with those of the smc data ; this is also provides confirmation of the reliability of our application of the smc relation to sextans a. we will discuss this more in section 4 .",
    "the lines in figure [ figpl ] are the above relations , shifted to our measured apparent distance moduli of @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "our data contain two other distance indicators , the rgb tip and red clump , which can be used to provide independent checks of our cepheid distance .",
    "figure [ figtrgb ] shows the @xmath27-band luminosity function in the region of the rgb tip .",
    "we measure the tip position to fall at @xmath56 , which is consistent with the measurements of @xmath57 by @xcite and @xmath58 by @xcite .",
    "correcting for extinction and adopting @xmath59 computed from the z=0.001 and z=0.0004 padova models @xcite , we calculate the true distance modulus to be @xmath60 .    another independent distance can be determined from the position of the red clump .",
    "figure [ figrc ] shows the @xmath27-band luminosity function in the region of the red clump .",
    "our best fit to the luminosity function was obtained with a gaussian centered at @xmath61 with a width of @xmath62 . using the semi - empirical red clump calibration described by @xcite",
    ", we calculate an absolute magnitude of @xmath63 for sextans a ; this produces a true distance modulus of @xmath64 .    combining our three distance determinations",
    ", we calculate the true distance modulus to sextans a to be @xmath0 , corresponding to a distance of @xmath1 mpc .",
    "we note that this distance is significantly closer than the value of 1.44 mpc assumed in paper i ( adopted from dohm - palmer et al .",
    "we also note that , while we do not explicitly include calibration uncertainties , these are @xmath65 magnitudes and thus do not add to our reported uncertainties .",
    "our distance is consistent with the @xcite cepheid distance of ( @xmath5 ) , but is inconsistent at the @xmath66 level with the @xcite cepheid distance ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "we note , however , that the @xcite cepheid distance is based on single - epoch photometry and thus is more uncertain than is indicated by their error bars .",
    "in addition , @xcite present an rgb tip distance modulus of @xmath7 , which is consistent with our distance at the @xmath66 level .",
    "distance measurement using cepheids typically rely on longer - period cepheids with ( @xmath67 days ) . as we have observed in sextans a and previously in leo a",
    ", large numbers of short - period cepheids are present in low - metallicity star - forming galaxies , due to the passage of the bheb sequence through the instability strip at fainter magnitudes @xcite .",
    "this allows for the determination of the distance using 82 cepheids , which is potentially much more accurate than that using the 5 longer - period cepheids of @xcite .",
    "however , one must first examine the question of whether or not these objects serve as reliable standard candles .    to address this question , we present distance moduli to five nearby galaxies in table [ tabcompare ] as determined by a variety of distance indicators . because of its relative insensitivity to age and metallicity , we will adopt the rgb tip distance as the comparison standard . comparing the short - period cepheid distances with the rgb tip distances , we see no significant systematic differences for the low - metallicity galaxies ( all but the lmc ) .",
    "we do note that the first - overtone distances are shorter by an average of 0.08 magnitudes for the lowest - metallicity galaxies ( sextans a and leo a )",
    ". this may be the sign of a real effect , but we also note that the data are consistent with no metallicity dependence of the distance . at the @xmath66 level , we can only conclude that any dependence of the short - period cepheid p - l relations on metallicity is no more than @xmath68 magnitudes per dex .",
    "however , the lmc distance from short - period cepheids is inconsistent at the @xmath69 level with that from the rgb tip ( as well as from all other distance indicators ) , in that they are roughly @xmath70 magnitudes closer .",
    "we interpret this as resulting from the metallicity dependence of the position of the bheb sequence as mentioned above . at sufficiently low metallicities",
    ", the heavily - populated bheb sequence passes through the instability strip at a luminosity that produces large numbers of cepheids with periods of @xmath71 day . at higher metallicity ,",
    "the bheb sequence passes through the instability strip at a brighter magnitude , and thus 1-day cepheids are only produced by stars passing through the instability strip as they evolve off the main sequence .",
    "based on these data , it appears that the dividing line is between the metallicities of the smc and lmc .",
    "the eros p - l relations @xcite give strength to the argument that there is a fundamental difference between the lmc and smc cepheid populations , as they found a significant slope change at 2 days in their smc cepheids but not their lmc ones .",
    "table [ tabcompare ] also gives the distances as calculated using rr lyraes , long - period cepheids , and the red clump .",
    "this allows us to expand on the comparison we made in an earlier paper @xcite , which considered only ic 1613 and the magellanic clouds .",
    "the four rr lyrae samples are all taken from objects with @xmath72 , thus providing an insufficient baseline for an examination of the effects of metallicity on the rr lyrae calibration .",
    "however , we can compare the zero point of the calibration to that of the rgb tip , and we find that the values we assumed are consistent at much better than the @xmath66 level .",
    "a comparison of the four long - period cepheid distances with the rgb tip distances shows a hint of a metallicity dependence in the cepheid distances . making a least @xmath13 fit",
    ", we measure a slope of @xmath73 magnitudes per dex , in the sense that low - metallicity galaxies are measured to be more distant by cepheids than by the rgb tip .",
    "this slope is consistent with those predicted theoretically by @xcite and measured by @xcite . while this is a @xmath66 result , improved data on the sextans a long - period cepheids ( or those in similarly metal - poor galaxies ) is needed to improve the measurement .",
    "it is clear that the p - l relation does not have a large ( @xmath32 magnitudes per dex ; beaulieu et al .",
    "1997 and gould 1994 ) dependence on metallicity .",
    "we find no evidence of a correlation between metallicity and the red clump @xmath74 rgb tip distance difference , which is comforting since metallicity is accounted for in our semi - empirical red clump calibration .",
    "the zero points are also consistent at the @xmath66 level , providing additional evidence that the red clump is an accurate distance indicator , provided that population effects are properly accounted for .    finally , we present distance moduli relative to the smc for all galaxies in table [ tabrelative ] .",
    "although the lmc is generally the standard for such comparisons , we chose to use the smc for the comparison because it has accurate distances determined with all five distance indicators .",
    "we have presented photometry of deep wfpc2 observations of sextans a. observations were made over 16 epochs in f814w and 8 epochs in f555w , permitting a search for variable stars .",
    "we identified 82 periodic variables with clean light curves in both bands ; all 82 appear to be short - period cepheids .",
    "we found fundamental - mode cepheids with periods as short as 0.8 days and first - overtone cepheids with periods of 0.5 days .    using these cepheids , we measured a distance to sextans a using a p - l relation computed using smc short - period ( @xmath71 day ) cepheids .",
    "we compared this distance to that obtained with other means , and find that short - period cepheids are indeed a viable standard candle for objects at or below the metallicity of the smc .",
    "given the large numbers of these that should be found in low - metallicity star - forming galaxies , these objects can provide much more accurate distance measurements than those obtained using other distance indicators .",
    "we also examined relative distances produced by five distance indicators for five galaxies in and near the local group : sextans a , leo a , ic 1613 , and the magellanic clouds .",
    "we find that relative distances calculated using the rgb tip , red clump , and rr lyrae are consistent for the sample .",
    "however , we find a metallicity dependence of @xmath73 magnitudes per dex in distances calculated using reddening - free cepheid techniques .",
    "the relative distances for the five galaxies are calculated using these distance measurements .",
