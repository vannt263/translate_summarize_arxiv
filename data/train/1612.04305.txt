    "in the last decade , we have observed a paramount advance in the area of condensed matter physics : for the very first time an allotrope of carbon with the thickness of a single atom was synthesized .",
    "this allotrope has become popular under the name of graphene ; in this material the carbon atoms are arranged in an hexagonal lattice @xcite .",
    "the graphene was imagined by p. r. wallace in the fourties when he considered an isolated layer of carbon atoms as a model to understand the parallel and transverse conduction properties of graphite @xcite . the synthesis of 2004 confirmed and found new exceptional properties of graphene @xcite .",
    "in particular , the experimental evidence confirmed that the charge carriers in graphene can be described through quasi - particles that have the same behaviour as relativistic dirac fermions @xcite .",
    "this fact had been predicted theoretically when it was proved that the dirac field theory in @xmath5 space - time dimensions emerges from wallace s tight - binding model in the low energy regime ( see @xcite and @xcite for a related construction ) .",
    "it is noteworthy to mention that the dirac structure emerges , in graphene as in the nowdays so called dirac materials , as a consequence of specific symmetries @xcite .",
    "the realization of graphene opens up new horizons in the production and the study of other two - dimensional materials like h - bn , germanene , and silicene , among others ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "experimentally , it has been shown that graphene presents corrugations even in free state @xcite .",
    "accordingly , it has turned out that the dirac equation in curved space is a natural model to study the electronic properties of the graphene sheet when corrugations and topological defects are taken into account @xcite . in the last two decades , motivated by different problems in condensed matter physics",
    ", an intense activity has emerged in the study of the dirac equation in curved space .",
    "this equation has been used to approach various problems like the spectrum of fullerenes @xcite , the problem of disclinations in icosahedral fullerenes @xcite , the problem of impurities and topological defects in graphene @xcite , the role of ripples in graphene @xcite , the quantum hall effect in topological insulators @xcite , the ultra - cold atoms on optical lattices @xcite , the flexural phonons in curved graphene @xcite and other gravitational analogues ; problems that may have a physical realization in a bench - top experiment like wormholes in graphene @xcite , btz black holes @xcite , and the hawking - unruh effect in graphene @xcite , among others .",
    "some of the major changes correspond to the production of a gauge field similar to the electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "in particular the existence of pseudo - magnetic as a consequence of local deformations of graphene was first suggested theoretically @xcite and confirmed experimentally afterwards . in the scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm )",
    "experimental results , levy and coworkers showed the existence of pseudo - landau levels for fields greater than @xmath6 in the corresponding triangular bubble - like structures created by the deformation @xcite .",
    "the strain in graphene has resulted in a series of novel effects that are absent in flat graphene ( see @xcite and references therein ) . based on symmetry arguments of the fundamental lattice , in this last report , all the interaction terms between the charge carriers and phonon on a sheet of deformed graphene that are linear in the strain tensor and its derivative were constructed in a very clean way . at a first glance @xcite , this approach of introducing the strain in graphene is not compatible with the model based on the dirac equation in curved space when the metric tensor is @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the strain tensor , unless the curved surface is interpreted as the dirac cone manifold @xcite . here",
    ", we must emphasize that a model built using only symmetry arguments of the fundamental lattice may fail to account for the role of topological defects like the disclinations or pentagons formations due to the strain , which certainly break the hexagonal symmetry of the lattice @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the curvature effects on the electronic properties of a sheet of graphene based on the dirac equation on curved spaces @xcite . in order to study the effect of curvature we use the local density of states ( ldos ) , which is calculated using the green s function approach @xcite .",
    "the general covariance of the corresponding green equation and the lichnnerowicz formula @xcite are exploited in order to explore the curvature dependance of the green s function .",
    "the calculation is done using the coordinate frame provided by the riemann normal coordinates ( rnc ) @xcite .",
    "namely , two physical situations of interest are considered : a sheet of graphene almost flat with small corrugations and a sheet of graphene with pronounced curvature in a local domain .",
    "these scenarios give rise to two different physical behaviors in ldos ; particularly , in the first situation we noticed that the curvature changes the conical nature of the dispersion relation resulting in a shift on the momentum space of the dirac cone , while in the second situation we found that the geometric protuberance implies the existence of emergent landau pseudo - states . here ,",
    "as remarked below , we promote the curvature , that is the ricci ( or equivalently the gaussian curvature in this 2d case ) , to be the fundamental physical quantity that characterizes the deformation of graphene sheet .",
    "furthermore , we put forward the idea that ricci curvature is the actual physical quantity that gives origin to the pseudo - landau levels in analogy to the flat graphene case in presence of a uniform magnetic field . in this manner ,",
    "the pseudo - magnetic field is proportional to the curvature itself . finally ,",
    "looking out for more tangible curvature effects , we give expressions for the electronic internal energy and heat capacity of graphene in the small curvature regime and the energy of the ground state in the strong curvature regime .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ] , the model for a curved graphene sheet is presented .",
    "the model is based on the dirac equation defined on a space - time , @xmath9 of dimension @xmath10 . in section [ sec3 ] ,",
    "the green s function is computed using rnc in both physical regimes mentioned above . in section [ sec3dot5 ]",
    "we establish the analogy of the dirac fermions in curved space with the landau problem . in section [ sec4 ] ,",
    "the curvature effects on the electronic properties of graphene are probed through the ldos .",
    "finally , in section [ sec5 ] , we summarize the main conclusions and perspectives of this work .",
    "in this section , we introduce the simplest model to describe the electronic degrees of freedom in a curved sheet of graphene . to introduce the model , we start from the dirac equation , @xmath11 defined on a @xmath5 curved space - time @xmath9 , where @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath13 are the dirac matrices that satisfy the clifford algebra @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the minkowski metric tensor .",
    "the @xmath16 is a set of vierbeins attached to each coordinate patch of @xmath9 .",
    "the capital latin indices @xmath17 label the minkowski flat coordinates whereas the greek indices @xmath18 label the local curved coordinates . in the dirac equation @xmath19 is the covariant derivative for the spinor representation of the lorentz group @xmath20 , where @xmath21 $ ] is the spin - connection and @xmath22 are elements of a @xmath23-form that satisfy the maurer - cartan equations @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath24 and @xmath25 encode the geometrical content of the dirac equation .",
    "the general space - time metric tensor can be written in terms of vierbeins , i.e. @xmath26 . for simplicity , we consider a stationary space - time with curved space only , @xmath27 with @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the fermi velocity . now , we separate the time component from the spatial ones of the indices @xmath17 and @xmath18 , that is @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively . thus , suitable vierbeins for this metric are @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , such that , @xmath35 . for this metric , it is not difficult to show that @xmath36 and @xmath37 , with spatial indices @xmath38 and @xmath39 . therefore , the covariant derivative is reduced to @xmath40.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] next , the separation between temporal and spatial indices , in the dirac equation , turns out to be a schr@xmath41dinger type of equation @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "this is the same decomposition performed in @xcite for ultracold atom systems .",
    "now , we have the ingredients to write down a field - theoretic hamiltonian for the curved sheet of graphene : @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 is matrix transposition . the letters @xmath47 and @xmath48 are refering to the two independent dirac points .",
    "a particular representation of the dirac matrices is @xmath49 , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 , with @xmath53 , are the standard pauli matrices . in this representation , for flat graphene",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath54 , i. e. the low energy limit of the wallace tight - binding model @xcite .",
    "also , this hamiltonian @xmath55 is the same cosmological model posed by m. a. h. vozmediano and coworkers @xcite .",
    "given fields @xmath56 that satisfy eq .",
    "( [ thedirac ] ) through an standard fourier transformation in time we get @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the time - fourier transformed field . a general field configuration is obtained using the green function , @xmath59 of @xmath60 , where @xmath61 with @xmath62 by the standard technique @xcite . here , however , we will use this green function in order to give an expression for the local density of states ( ldos ) ( see equation ( [ ldos ] ) ) of the curved sheet of graphene .",
    "the general covariance of the green equation is exploited to explore the curvature dependance of the green function .",
    "we shall use the local frame defined by the so - called riemann normal coordinates ( rnc ) @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is a fiducial point that can be chosen as the origin @xcite . to this end",
    ", we revisit the calculation of the green function in these coordinates .",
    "let us first express @xmath65 , where @xmath66 .",
    "consequently , @xmath67 satisfies the equation @xmath68 with the reduced quantities @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "further simplification is gotten by taking the square of @xmath71 , since the clifford algebra implies @xmath72 , and using the lichnerowicz formula @xcite we obtain @xmath73 where @xmath2 is the scalar curvature .",
    "following @xcite , we perform the change @xmath74 , and additionally the factor @xmath75 in the dirac delta @xmath76 can be replaced by @xmath77 in order to atain further simplification @xcite .",
    "now , the green equation , after these changes , is cast into @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",
    "we can appreciate now the analogy with a quantum mechanical problem with `` hamiltonian '' @xmath80 .",
    "this operator can be further simplified as @xmath81    next , we use the fact that the metric tensor and spin connection ( using rnc ) can be written as a taylor series with coefficients given in terms of the covariant derivative of the riemann tensor @xcite .",
    "the first terms of these series expansions are @xmath82 where @xmath83 are higher order terms @xmath84 with @xmath85 .",
    "after some calculations , this means that the `` hamiltonian '' @xmath80 can be written as @xmath86 where curvature coefficients are evaluated already at the fiducial point @xmath64 .",
    "this expression for @xmath80 is exact but not so easy to manage because it involves an infinite number of terms .",
    "nevertheless , eq . ( [ eqexact ] ) is our starting point to carry out approximations for @xmath87 .",
    "the approximations we are going to make here correspond to two different physical situations ( see figure [ figesc1 ] ) . in the first scenario ,",
    "the value of the scalar curvature satisfies the condition @xmath88 , where @xmath3 is a typical graphene sample s size . in this case",
    ", one has an almost flat sheet of graphene with small curvature corrugations .",
    "thus , one can consider @xmath89 , with @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is a perturbation from the flat graphene that includes all curvature dependance .",
    "in addition , the coordinates @xmath92 range over all the domain of the graphene . in the second scenario ,",
    "the value of the scalar curvature satisfies the condition @xmath93 , where @xmath4 is a typical size of a local domain or patch where graphene presents a pronounced curvature . in this case , one has a sheet of graphene with strong curvature values at some points where the geometry around these points is considered approximately quadratic , which can be either parabolic or hyperbolic , depending on the sign of the scalar curvature @xmath2 . in this case , the coordinates range over all point of the domain of radius @xmath4 . in what follows ,",
    "we give expressions for the green functions in both approximations .",
    "top and bottom show schematic pictures of graphene in the weak and strong curvature regimes , respectively.,title=\"fig : \" ] +   top and bottom show schematic pictures of graphene in the weak and strong curvature regimes , respectively.,title=\"fig : \" ]      the simplest approximation corresponds with the situation where @xmath91 consist of a perturbation from the flat  hamiltonian \" @xmath94 . in this approach , the green s function can be written through the resolvent operator @xmath95 which can likewise be expanded as a perturbation series : @xmath96 where the unperturbed resolvent operator is given by @xmath97 .",
    "next , we need to find an expression for @xmath91",
    ". the first approximation consist of cutting off the series expansion up to linear terms in curvature , then , the pertubation is written as @xmath98 next , we sandwich the equation ( [ resolvent - expansion ] ) between bra @xmath99 and ket @xmath100 and use the resolvent identity @xmath101 . also , we simplify the calculation using the relation ( [ relation ] ) .",
    "the interaction contribution of the green function can be written as @xmath102 now , it is not difficult to show that the first two terms of @xmath91 ( eq . ( [ approxih ] ) ) do not contribute as a consequence of the antisymmetric character of the riemann curvature tensor ( see appendix [ apendice ] ) . thus , the green function up to first correction is given by @xmath103 this result for the green function is the same obtained some time before by l. parker et al @xcite in the context of quantum field theory ( qft ) in curved space - time .",
    "clearly , one can follow the procedure implemented here , based in the references @xcite , to compute higher order curvature terms . these terms , however , will be left out of the scope of this work .      within this approximation one",
    "retains a quadratic form of the local geometry . in this sense",
    ", we will look for eigenvalues and eigenstates of the operator ( [ eqexact ] ) .",
    "one can further simplify using @xmath104 , valid for two - dimensional manifolds , and @xmath105 for the spin - connection .",
    "accordingly , the operator is @xmath106 now , using the commutation relation @xmath107=i\\delta^{\\ell i}$ ] , the second term of eq .",
    "( [ complete - approx ] ) can be expressed as @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the two dimensional angular momentum operator .",
    "further corrections can be included when we consider variations of the curvature .",
    "clearly , @xmath110 can be written as @xmath111 with @xmath112 where @xmath113 , and @xmath114 .",
    "now , to find the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the operator ( [ eqop ] ) we express the operators @xmath115 and @xmath116 in terms of creation and annihilation operators .",
    "since we have a two - dimensional problem we introduce the operators @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 , which are given in terms of the @xmath121 s , conjugated operators to the @xmath115 s , defined by @xmath122 . in appendix",
    "[ alg - op ] , the commutation algebra of the operators @xmath115 and @xmath121 is presented .",
    "these relations are useful to show @xmath123=\\left[b_{\\zeta } , b^{\\dagger}_{\\zeta}\\right]=1 $ ] and @xmath124=\\left[a^{\\dagger}_{\\zeta } , b_{\\zeta}\\right]=\\left[a^{\\dagger}_{\\zeta } , b^{\\dagger}_{\\zeta}\\right]=\\left[a_{\\zeta } , b^{\\dagger}_{\\zeta}\\right]=0 $ ] .",
    "the advantage of introducing these operators is that the angular momentum operator can be written as @xmath125 and the operator @xmath126 as @xmath127 in addition , following up the analogy with the quantum harmonic oscillator one can diagonalize straightforwardly this operator .",
    "the resulting quantum states are @xmath128 where the quantum numbers @xmath129 and @xmath130 , where @xmath131 being the eigenvalue of the number operator @xmath132 and @xmath129 is the eigenvalue of the number operator @xmath133 . here , the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath126 are denoted by @xmath134 .",
    "these eigenvalues are @xmath135 , where @xmath136 and @xmath137 is the cyclotron frecuency in this situation .",
    "notice that @xmath134 does not depend on @xmath138 ; this means that @xmath139 and @xmath140 have the same eigenvalues .",
    "this is not a surprise since there is not preference between the triangular lattices that make up the hexagonal lattice . in the above energy eigenvalues",
    "@xmath141 is the sign function . also , let us note that for negative values of curvature the quantum number @xmath129 has a minimum value different from zero , namely , for both sign of curvature by @xmath142\\theta\\left(-r\\right)$ ] .",
    "additionally , for a finite system of area @xmath17 the landau degeneracy , in the symmetric gauge , is given by @xmath143 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath144 this means that @xmath145 , where @xmath146 . in accordance with our regime of approximation",
    "let us notice that the angular momentum modes @xmath147 are practically not excitated since @xmath148 .",
    "hence , in this case the eigenvalues modes reduce to @xmath149 .    now that we know the quantum states and their associated energy eigenvalues , we may write the spectral decomposition of the green function @xmath150 where @xmath151 are normalized eigenfunctions . for the moment , the explicit form of eigenfunctions is not needed in the present work , but they can nonetheless be written in various representations .",
    "in this section , we establish an analogy of the dirac fermions in curved space with the landau problem .",
    "the squared hamiltonian of the massless dirac fermions in a uniform constant field is @xmath152 where the gauge - invariant kinetic momentum is @xmath153 and @xmath154 the uniform magnetic field ( see appendix [ landau ] ) .",
    "now , in order to establish precisely the analogy between the landau hamiltonian for the massless dirac fermions in curved space we write down again the equation ( [ eqop ] ) @xmath155 note that the first term of @xmath156 corresponds to a landau problem hamiltonian in the symmetric gauge where @xmath157 plays the role of the `` magnetic field '' or pseudo - magnetic field as it is posed in @xcite , whereas the second term involves a rotor contribution where the curvature term @xmath158 plays the role of the inverse of the moment of inertia .",
    "the cyclotron resonance frecuency satisfies @xmath159 .",
    "these squared hamiltonians ( [ diracmagnetic1 ] ) and ( [ eqopap1 ] ) bear two crucial differences , in the magnetic case the curvature strength @xmath154 is coupled to @xmath51 whereas in the curved case the corresponding curvature @xmath2 is couple to the identity matrix @xmath160 . in addition , with the approximation we performed another crucial difference is the @xmath161 term present in the curved case . besides these differences one can think of curvature @xmath2 as a physical field , analogous to the magnetic field , that is responsible of several phenomena like the pseudo - landau states .",
    "we emphasize that the relation between curvature @xmath2 and pseudo - magnetic field can be subjected to experimental scrutiny .",
    "in particular , let us focus on figures @xmath162 and @xmath163 found on @xcite by levy and coworkers . as they mentioned , figure @xmath162 corresponds to the experimental topographic line scan and the experimental determination of the @xmath164 over the tip trajectory shown in black line in their figure @xmath163 .",
    "we extracted data of the topographic line scan in order to fit a curve with a fifth order polynomial ( see eq .",
    "( [ fitcurve ] ) of appendix [ pseudo ] ) and then computed the curvature @xmath165 of this curve at the maximum , this corresponds to a principal curvature of the graphene nanobubble .",
    "although we did not access the data of the transverse line , by inspection of the figure 3(b ) of the same work @xcite one can state that the radius of curvature @xmath166 for a transverse line is bigger than @xmath167 , which means that the ricci curvature @xmath168 . now",
    ", using this value of curvature one gets the bound @xmath169 . in others words ,",
    "the relation between @xmath2 and @xmath164 looks reasonably in agreement with the experimental observations .",
    "in this section , we give expressions for the ldos in both physical scenarios posed in the last section , which are weak curvature corrugation and strong curvature regime on the graphene sheet .",
    "the local density of states ( ldos ) , @xmath170 , is used in order to probe the curvature effects on the electronic degrees of freedom of graphene . in particular",
    ", ldos is expressed through the the green s function @xcite by @xmath171 the @xmath172 is the valley degeneration due to the two independent dirac points in graphene and @xmath173 refers to trace over the pseudo - spin and spin space .      in this subsection",
    "we compute the local density of states corresponding to curved graphene within the approximation ( [ expansion2 ] ) .",
    "basically , we need to take the pseudo - spin and spin trace , the imaginary part , and the limiting process @xmath174 on the function @xmath175 .",
    "the pseudo - spin trace cancels out the term @xmath176 since the matrix structure of @xmath177 is traceless , thus one has @xmath178 , where @xmath179 are the pseudo - spin and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "to take the imaginary part and the limiting process of @xmath180 one can follow various ways , for instance , one could express @xmath181 in terms of bessel functions as done in @xcite . here , we note that at the level of approximation stated above ( [ expansion2 ] ) , the green function @xmath181 is consistent with @xmath182 where we have shown explicitly the @xmath183 dependance .",
    "now , we take @xmath174 or @xmath184 and recall that @xmath185 , use the dirac identity @xcite and then we take the imaginary part . accordingly , the local density of states is given by @xmath186 where @xmath187 .",
    "note that this last relation imposes the condition @xmath188 the dirac delta can be expanded by means of an identity @xcite @xmath189,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath190 .",
    "then , the ldos is given by @xmath191 where @xmath192 is the heaviside function .",
    "clearly , for flat spaces @xmath193 , we recover the standard relation for the local density of states @xcite .",
    "also , it is noted that , within this approximation , for points @xmath194 with negative values of curvature the local density of states corresponds to the usual one .",
    "however , for points @xmath194 with positive values of curvature we find a change in the local density of states .",
    "these results for the ldos can be improved with higher order curvature corrections of the green function @xcite .",
    "in addition , this same result ( eq .",
    "( [ ldos ] ) ) can be seen at the level of the dispersion relation @xmath195 , which can be computed using the operator @xmath80 .",
    "the energy dispersion relation turns out to be @xmath196 note that this energy dispersion relation is similar to the relativistic energy dispersion relation where @xmath197 plays the role of mass .",
    "the curvature appears with a prefactor @xmath198 which makes @xmath199 for a sample of size @xmath200 . in the positive curvature case",
    ", we have shown that in graphene arise a small gap , whereas in the negative curvature case we found the manner in which the curvature induces a minimum value of the charge carriers momentum .",
    "these both cases modify the conical nature of the energy dispersion relation turning on a shift in the momentum space of the dirac cone .      in order to look for a more tangible curvature effect ,",
    "let us evaluate the electronic internal energy , @xmath201 , for a sheet of graphene with weak curvature .",
    "taking into account particles and holes , @xmath201 can be computed using the following expression : @xmath202 where @xmath203 and @xmath204 is the density of states ( dos ) , with @xmath205 being the area element of the surface .",
    "now , we substitute the ldos ( [ ldos ] ) and we exchange integrals , to get @xmath206 for @xmath193 , one can integrate and find that the internal energy per unit of area , @xmath17 , is given by the standard result @xcite @xmath207 for curved graphene , @xmath208 , we performed a perturbative expansion in powers of @xmath209 and computed the heat capacity per unit of area , @xmath210 @xmath211\\left(\\frac{\\hbar v_{f}}{k_{b}t}\\right)^2+\\cdots,\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath212 is a local domain with positive curvature .",
    "note that , at the level of this approximation , negative values of curvature do not make any correction to the heat capacity of the graphene .      in this section ,",
    "we give a formal expression for the density of states in terms of the energy eigenvalues using the approximation ( [ approx2 ] ) .",
    "it is assumed , for simplicity , that curvature is approximately constant .",
    "similarly to the weak curvature regime one has @xmath213 .",
    "next , we use the orthogonality property of @xmath214 , the limit @xmath184 and the dirac identity @xcite .",
    "finally , we use the fact that within the strong curvature approximation the angular momentum is not excitable . in this manner",
    ", the density of states is given by @xmath215 the energy eigenvalues of the dirac fermions moving in a positive and negative local curved patch of a manifold are given by @xmath216 where we recall the resonance cyclotron frecuency @xmath217 .",
    "these eigenvalues spectrum is almost the same as the one obtained for flat graphene in presence of a strong and transversal magnetic field @xcite .",
    "in what follows , we give the expression for the internal energy for the strong curvature regime .",
    "we substitute the dos in ( [ internal ] ) and we use the identity @xcite . after a straightforward calculation ,",
    "the internal energy and the number of particles ( particles and holes ) are @xmath218 where @xmath219 is the fermi - dirac statistics .",
    "also , we have introduced a chemical potential @xmath18 .",
    "the energy eigenvalues are proportional to @xmath220 , thus it is natural to define a characteristic temperature by @xmath221 .    as a matter of consistency",
    ", one must recover the standard internal energy per unit of area ( [ int - energ ] ) in the limit when @xmath222 .",
    "indeed , one can make the steps in the appendix [ cp ] to reach this statement .",
    "now , the opposite limit @xmath223 is usually the case when one has a pronounced value of curvature .",
    "for instance , the pseudo - magnetic field , @xmath164 , ranges the values @xmath224{\\rm t}$ ] in the levy et al .",
    "experiment @xcite .",
    "these values correspond to the characteristic temperature @xmath225 in the range @xmath226\\times 10^{3}{\\rm k}$ ] .",
    "hence , the thermal effects are practically negligible for massless dirac fermions confined in an strong curvature protuberance .",
    "thus , the internal energy corresponds essentially to the energy of the ground state .",
    "the energy of the ground state can be computed assumed that all pseudo - landau levels are filled up to the fermi level @xmath227 , where @xmath228 is the density of the particles in the domain where the curvature is pronounced .",
    "thus the energy of the ground states , @xmath229 , is @xmath230}e_{n}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this energy will have discontinuities in the pseudo - magnetization @xmath231 at the pseudo - magnetic field values @xmath232 we expect , then , an analogous de haas - van alphen effect occurs in this case . in a future communication",
    "we will report a systematic study of this analogous phenomena .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the electronic degrees of freedom of a graphene curved sheet upon the basis of the dirac equation on curved space - time .",
    "the curved space - time we use corresponds to the metric @xmath27 , where @xmath29 is the fermi velocity and @xmath233 are the components of the metric tensor of the spatial sector .",
    "these electronic degrees of freedom are studied by means of the local density of states ( ldos ) , which is expressed through the green function associated to the operator @xmath234 , where @xmath235 is the energy and @xmath177 is an euclidean dirac operator .",
    "it was studied in two different physical situations : i ) weak curvature regime and ii ) strong curvature regime .    in the first case",
    "i ) , we found that ldos has an open gap proportional to @xmath236 for positive values of curvature whereas ldos corresponds to the flat expression for the negative values of curvature . in the second case",
    "ii ) , it was found an analogy with the well known landau problem of the flat graphene under a strong magnetic field . the pronounced curvature , in this situation , affects the charge carriers in such a manner that pseudo landau states emerge .",
    "this analogy allows us to identify the curvature with a pseudo - magnetic field @xmath164 through the relation , @xmath237 .",
    "the resonance cyclotron frecuency turns out to be identical to the magnetic case @xmath238 .",
    "the particular differences with the original landau problem were briefly discussed .",
    "in addition , using the values of the pseudo - magnetic field @xmath239 reported in @xcite it was found that the characteristic temperatures are around @xmath240 .",
    "this means that in the strong curvature case the thermal effects are practically negligible and the internal energy is essentially the energy of the ground state . in particular , we give an expression for the energy of the ground state and we remarked the expectation of an analogous de haas - van alphen effect . in a future communication we will report a systematic study of this analogous phenomena .",
    "our approach can be extended in various directions . as was mentioned before ,",
    "the calculations performed in the weak curvature regime can be improved including higher order curvature terms in the green function of the dirac equation . in the strong curvature regime",
    ", it requires a systematic analysis of the oscilations in the pseudo - magnetic field that appear in the de haas - van alphen effect ; one can take a guide study of the magnetic case ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the pseudo - landau states found here can also be precursive to other analogous effects like the quantum hall effect and the khalatnikov - de haas van alphen effect .",

    "our starting point to compute this amplitude is the eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) .",
    "the interaction operator @xmath91 can be split into three terms @xmath242 the amplitude associated to the last term is straightforward . for the first and second operator it is convenient to use the relation @xmath243 where @xmath244 is a collective indice of order @xmath147 which means that @xmath245 . for the first operator , @xmath246",
    ", one has to use @xmath247 . after substituting in the amplitude one has @xmath248 where @xmath249 .",
    "next , one can show that @xmath250\\nonumber\\\\&+&k_{2}(p)p_{i}p_{j}p_{k}p_{l } , \\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath251 and @xmath252 .",
    "thus one has a symmetric tensor in the indices @xmath253 and @xmath254 , then by contracting with the riemman tensor , which is antisymmetric in these indices , one gets that the amplitude is exactly cero .",
    "the set of operators @xmath259 form a closed lie algebra .",
    "in particular , they satisfy the commutation relations @xmath260&=&-i\\zeta",

    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then @xmath261 and @xmath262 can be diagonalize simultaneously .",
    "alternatively , one can define the operators @xmath263 , whose commutation relations are @xmath264=4\\zeta i\\epsilon_{ij}/r},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which commute with each @xmath115 ; in particular , the angular momentum operator can be written as @xmath265      in this section we can follow @xcite for the treatment of massless dirac fermions in presence of a uniform magnetic field .",
    "let us begin with the landau hamiltonian in this context @xmath266 where @xmath267 is the vector potential . to obtain the eigenvalues and eigenstates of @xmath55 , it is often common to square the operator .",
    "thus , after a straigforward calculation it is not difficult to find @xmath268 where the gauge - invariant kinetic momentum @xmath153 and the curvature strength tensor @xmath269 .",
    "the squared hamiltonian , ( [ square ] ) , is in fact , a lichnnerowiczs formula for the dirac operator on a manifold .",
    "in addition , for an uniform magnetic field one has the vector potential in the symmetric gauge : @xmath270 , then @xmath271 . which yields the following squared hamiltonian @xmath272      in this subsection , we estimate the value of the pseudo - magnetic field based on the extracted points of figure 3(a ) of the article by levy and coworkers .",
    "this data corresponds to a section of the actual surface that represents the graphene nanobubble .",
    "once we have extracted the data , we fit a curve with a simple polynomial approximation .",
    "the best fit found corresponds to a fifth order polynomial @xmath273 where values @xmath274 , with @xmath275 are given by @xmath276 , @xmath277 , @xmath278 , @xmath279 , @xmath280 , and @xmath281 .",
    "this function allows us to compute the curvature of the curve by using the formula @xmath282 this curvature corresponds to a principal curvature of the surface along the topographical line measured in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , we do not know the values of the transversal curve so as to compute the value of the other principal curvature . however",
    ", glimpsing the figure 3(b ) of @xcite one can say that the radius of curvature of the transverse line is bigger than the actual line , i.e. t @xmath283 , so @xmath284 , and the ricci curvature is @xmath285 .",
    "using now the eq .",
    "( [ pseudo - campo ] ) one gets the corresponding bound on the pseudo - magnetic field @xmath286 , which looks reasonably in agreement with experimental observations .",
    "we substitute the dos in ( [ internal ] ) and use the identity @xcite . after a strightforward calculation , the internal energy ( particles and holes ) is @xmath287 where we have taken into account the angular momentum modes .",
    "let us take positive curvature , @xmath288 .",
    "in addition , define @xmath289 such that the energy levels ( [ energy - level ] ) are given by @xmath290 notice that for each @xmath147 value @xmath291 is almost a continuos spectra for @xmath292 small .",
    "this means that we can replace @xmath293 by a continuos variable .",
    "thus , within this approximation the internal energy is given by @xmath294 we perform the change of variable @xmath295 , hence @xmath296.\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , using @xmath297 , due to landau degeneracy , and the area @xmath298 , it is not difficult to conclude that the internal energy per unit area is given by the desired expression ( [ int - energ ] ) .",
