    "heusler alloys consist a large family of intermetallic compounds which attract regularly considerable attention due to the variety of magnetic phenomena which they present . lately",
    "the interest has been focused on the ones being half - metals ( hm ) like nimnsb or co@xmath0mnsn.@xcite these compounds are ferromagnets for which the minority spin - band presents a gap and the fermi level falls within this gap .",
    "thus the spin polarization at the fermi level is 100% and these materials are of special interest for spintronic applications;@xcite the spin of the electron and not the charge is used as the property to control the device .",
    "contrary to other hm systems like the diluted magnetic semiconductors or the manganites and some oxides,@xcite the half- and full - heusler alloys ( e.g. nimnsb and co@xmath0mnsn , respectively ) and the zinc - blende compounds like cras@xcite present very high curie temperatures making them attractive for industrial applications .",
    "lately i have devoted a lot of work on the latter compounds trying to address three main points i ) the origin of the half - metallicity@xcite ii ) whether the half - metallicity is preserved at the surfaces or films@xcite and iii ) to predict new half - metallic materials which may present better growth on top of semiconductors.@xcite using first principle calculations it was shown in the case of the ordered half - heusler alloys like nimnsb that the gap is formed between the occupied bonding @xmath8 states resulting from the interaction between the higher- and the lower - valent transition metal atoms and the corresponding antibonding states.@xcite for the full - heusler alloys like co@xmath0mnsn the situation is more complicated since there are also states located only at the co sites and the resulting gap is tiny.@xcite the total spin moment for the latter compounds is given by the relation @xmath3=@xmath5 - 24 , where @xmath3 is the total spin moment in @xmath4 and @xmath5 the total number of valence electrons .",
    "i will discuss this behavior in detail in a later paragraph .    in the present contribution i will conclude this study by examining the behavior of the so - called quaternary heusler alloys . in the latter compounds ,",
    "one of the four sites is occupied by two different kinds of neighboring elements like co@xmath0[cr@xmath1mn@xmath9al where the y site is occupied by cr or mn atoms ( see fig . 1 in ref .",
    "for the definition of the structure ) . to perform this study i used the korringa - kohn - rostoker ( kkr ) method@xcite developed by professor akai , which has been already used with success to study the magnetic semiconductors.@xcite the atomic disorder at a specific site is implemented using the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) .",
    "the space is divided in non - overlapping muffin - tin spheres and the vanishing charge in the interstitial region is considered to be constant and charge neutrality is imposed .",
    "such an approximation is reasonable to describe a close - packed structure like the one of the heusler alloys . to check the validity of this description",
    "i compared the total spin moment with the full - potential calculations performed in ref . .",
    "for all the compounds with the exception of co@xmath0val both methods produced similar magnetic properties for the experimental lattice constants.@xcite v @xmath10 wavefunctions have a large extent and the muffin - tin approximation is not adequate to describe the v magnetism ; thus i had to use a lattice constant 4% larger than the experimental one to get a half - metallic compound , as predicted by the full - potential kkr for the experimental lattice constant .",
    "i assumed that the lattice constant varies linearly with the concentration @xmath6 which has been verified for several quaternary alloys.@xcite finally i should mention that the total spin moment is not exactly an integer due to numerical inaccuracies . to decide whether an alloy is half - metallic or not i used the total dos as a criterion , as was also the case in the previous studies.@xcite i will firstly focus my study on the behavior of the total spin moment for several cases and show that it follows the slater - pauling behavior when the limiting cases are half - metals . afterwards",
    "i will study the case where the y site ( see fig.1 in ref . )",
    "is occupied by two different elements like co@xmath0[cr@xmath1mn@xmath2al , followed by the case when there are two different types of @xmath11 atoms like co@xmath0mn[al@xmath1sn@xmath2 .",
    "final case is when the x sites are disordered like [ fe@xmath1co@xmath2@xmath0mnal . at the end",
    "i summarize and conclude .     in @xmath4 for a variety of compounds as a function of the concentration @xmath6 ( @xmath6=0,0.1,0.2, ... ,0.9,1 ) .",
    "i assumed that the lattice constant varies linearly with the concentration @xmath6 . with filled geometrical objects the cases obeying the rule @xmath7 where @xmath5 is the total number of valence electrons ;",
    "this is the so - called slater - pauling behavior . ]",
    ".[table1]atom - projected spin moments for co@xmath0[cr@xmath1mn@xmath2al with @xmath6=0,0.1,0.2, ... ,0.9,1 .",
    "the spin moments have been scaled to one atom .",
    "the total moment is given by the relation @xmath12 , where @xmath13 stands for the interstitial region . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     now i will go on with the case of the x@xmath0y[z@xmath1z@xmath14 compounds , where i change the charge at the z site .",
    "i studied both the co@xmath0mn[al@xmath1si@xmath9 and co@xmath0mn[al@xmath1sn@xmath9 .",
    "si and sn are isoelectronic and both families present the same behavior , thus i will restrict my presentation to the second family .",
    "the moment changes from 4 up to 5 @xmath4 linearly and thus all the intermediate cases are hms . in table",
    "[ table2 ] i have gathered the atom - resolved spin - moments .",
    "the @xmath11 atoms show a practically constant moment and the extra charge is taken into account by the transition metal atoms .",
    "if i look carefully at the mn majority spin band ( not presented here ) , there are unoccupied states at the vicinity of the fermi level which pass under the fermi level and become occupied as the concentration of sn increases .",
    "thus the mn spin moment increases practically linearly from 2.6 to 3.2 @xmath4",
    ". the higher polarization of the mn @xmath8 states polarizes also the co bands since they form a common majority band and the co moment increases by 0.2 @xmath4 .",
    "atom projected dos in the case that both x sites are occupied by co and fe with 50% probability ( system is denoted by [ fe@xmath15co@xmath15]@xmath0mnal ) and when one sublattice is occupied exclusively by fe and the other by co atoms ( system is denoted by fecomnal ) .",
    "all compounds are half - metals .",
    "the numbers in the legends are the atomic spin moments in @xmath4 and the larger ones are the total spin moments . ]",
    "the last case i will discuss is when i mix the high - valent transition metal atoms .",
    "the first family is the [ fe@xmath1co@xmath2@xmath0mnal , where the total spin moment increases from 2 to 4 @xmath4 with the concentration .",
    "the al moment stays small and is negligible while the mn moment is 2.6 @xmath4 for all concentrations .",
    "the fe moment varies form @xmath170.32 to @xmath170.26 @xmath4 and the co one from 0.63 to 0.75 @xmath4 .",
    "thus the atomic spin moments change little and the increase in the total spin moment arises exclusively from the substitution of fe by co. it is also interesting to compare [ fe@xmath15co@xmath15]@xmath0mnal with @xmath18 . in the latter compound one of the sublattices",
    "is occupied exclusively by fe atoms and the other by co ones .",
    "both systems are hms as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and the total spin moment is 3 @xmath4 .",
    "both compounds show similar atomic spin moments , thus the exact position of the fe and co atoms is not so relevant for the magnetic properties , which are controlled mainly by the concentration of the chemical elements .",
    "if i compare the doss presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , i see that the atom projected ones have the same characteristics although the ones for fecomnal are more spiky .",
    "the main difference is a small majority gap just below the fermi level in fecomnal which is washed out for [ fe@xmath15co@xmath15]@xmath0mnal .",
    "this gap is the signature of the order .",
    "+ the second family of compounds is the [ rh@xmath1co@xmath2@xmath0mnal .",
    "rh and co are isoelectronic elements and the total spin moment is 4 @xmath4 for all concentrations . also rhcomnal is a hm with magnetic properties similar to [ rh@xmath15co@xmath15]@xmath0mnal as it was the case for the compounds containing fe . since rh moment is much smaller than the co one , the mn moment has to increase considerably , from 2.6 to 3.4 @xmath4 , with the increase of rh concentration to keep the total spin moment constant , .",
    "a special case uder study is the [ mn@xmath1co@xmath2@xmath0val family . for this compound",
    "the spin moment changes from @xmath172 to 2 @xmath4 with the concentration @xmath6 . as shown in ref .",
    "the mn and v atoms in mn@xmath0val are antiferromagnetically coupled and v carries a large spin moment , while in co@xmath0val the co and v atoms are ferromagnetically coupled and the moment is mainly carried by the co atoms .",
    "for @xmath6=0.5 there is the case of a compound with zero total spin moment but with magnetic constituents ; @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the mn spin moment decreases from @xmath171.45 @xmath4 to -0.35 with the concentration @xmath6 while the co spin moment increases from 0.2 to 0.95 @xmath4 and the v one decreases from 0.8 to 0.16 @xmath4 .    in this contribution",
    "i expanded the study already performed for the ordered heusler alloys to cover also the quaternary heusler compounds like co@xmath0[cr@xmath1mn@xmath2al , co@xmath0mn[al@xmath1sn@xmath2 and [ fe@xmath1co@xmath2@xmath0mnal . using the korringa - kohn - rostoker method in the coherent potential approximation",
    "i have shown that independently from which site is disordered , all compounds are half - metals and the total spin moment @xmath3 scales linearly with the total number of valence electrons @xmath5 following the rule @xmath7 , thus @xmath3 scales also linearly with the concentration @xmath6 . depending of the family under",
    "study the atomic spin moments change in a way that the above rule , known also as the slater - pauling behavior , is obeyed .",
    "finally an interesting case is [ mn@xmath1co@xmath2@xmath0val where the moment scales linearly from @xmath22 @xmath4 to 2 @xmath4 and for @xmath23 the total spin moment is zero but the constituents are magnetic .    financial support from the rt network of computational magnetoelectronics ( contract rtn1 - 1999 - 00145 ) of the european commission",
