    "increasing attention is directed towards the study of surface - adsorbate complexes , since these systems are key to understanding important chemical processes , @xcite , and also constitute the next natural paradigm for fundamental light - matter processes .",

    "the first term gives a repulsive interaction between the atomic cores , while the second term is attractive and due to the exchange of electrons between the adsorbate and the surface .",

    "if we are not interested in the full wavefunction of the system but we choose to directly look at single particle quantities , negf offer a natural general and in - principle - exact way to go beyond size limitations , and to treat electrons and nuclei exactly and on equal footing ( in practice approximations must be introduced ) . for our present system",
    ", this would imply a two - component formulation of coupled kadanoff - baym ( kbe ) equations , one component for each type of degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "however , to just explore the scope of negf for adsorbate dynamics , we here adopt a much cruder strategy , namely we use negf for electrons and a classical treatment for the nuclei .",
    "the most straightforward approximation is then to use the born - oppenheimer separation of electronic and atomic degrees of freedom , and for each atomic configuration extract effective potentials generated by the electrons and felt by the atoms , known as born - oppenheimer surfaces . given these potential surfaces , there exists a number of schemes to propagate an initial atomic wave packet ; here we consider the ehrenfest approximation ( ea ) @xcite , which amounts to replace the nuclear wavepacket with a delta function , and to let the atomic position evolve under the average force from the electrons , or in other words demoting the operators @xmath56 and @xmath10 to classical variables .",

    "if the system is composed of an interacting region connected to a non - interacting reservoir ( as for example , the adsorbate and substrate parts in our system ) , the latter can be removed from the explicit description and still taken into account exactly via an embedding procedure @xcite . in this case , the self - energy for the interacting region becomes @xmath64 .",

    "let us first look at the evolution of the nuclear subsystem , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : position ] . with the full quantum mechanical solution we observe bond stretching for the pulse @xmath112 , but for large times the nuclear position returns to a region close to its equilibrium value . for the pulse @xmath113",
    "the nuclear coordinate continues to increase also for large times , signalling a finite probability of desorption .",
    "this is typical of the full quantum solution , where in general one part of the initial wave packet remains bound and performs oscillations in the potential well , while another part overcomes the potential barrier and thereafter propagates quasi - freely ( strictly the potential is zero only for @xmath114 ) .",
    "we note that with increasing interaction @xmath1 and increasing amplitude @xmath115 , the desorption probability also increases .",
    "the former is a result of the interaction induced quenching of electronic motion between the adsorbate and surface , resulting in a lower average bond kinetic energy and therefore a weaker bond ( cf . the form of electron - nuclear coupling in eq .",
    "[ ham_as ] and the definition @xmath116 for the bond kinetic energy ) .",
    "since the ea is a classical treatment of nuclei the only possible outcomes of an experiment is to have either full or no desorption , and in the intermediate regime the approximation will inevitably fail to reproduce the exact dynamics .",
    "this is verified in fig .",
    "[ fig : position ] where the exact results are best reproduced in the cases where the quantum solution predicts either a very small or very large desorption probability .",
    "the agreement is in general better for the pulse @xmath112 , which varies more slowly in time and is closer to the adiabatic situations where the ea is known to perform well .",
    "we now turn our attention to the electron dynamics , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : finiteelectron ] . when comparing the exact solution with the ea+ex@xmath81 dynamics we see clear differences , that are most pronounced in the case of partial desorption .",
    "in particular the ea shows oscillations in the electron density of greater amplitude , that persist even for long time .",
    "this can be explained in part by the inability of the ea to transfer energy from the electronic to the nuclear subsystem , due to neglect of electron - nuclear correlations , that in the exact simulation act as a dissipation channel for the electrons . in part",
    "it is also due to the fact that the effective adsorbate - surface hopping amplitude is larger in the ea , making is more probable for the electrons to tunnel between the substrate and the adsorbate . with quantum mechanical nuclei , the hopping amplitude ( proportional to @xmath117 ,",
    "[ ham_as ] ) is decreased by the presence of a split - off part of the nuclear wave packet having propagated to large distances .    comparing the exact and the ea+2b electron evolution",
    "we observe that the oscillations in density seen in the ea are reduced compared to the ea+ex@xmath81 result , and that this difference increases with stronger interactions .",
    "the damping of electron oscillations is a generic feature of approximate solutions of the kbe in finite systems , and was first discussed in @xcite .",
    "briefly , the reason for damping is that self - consistent approximations ( like the 2b ) include infinitely many electron - hole excitations ( through the infinite set of diagrams contained in the self - energy ) , which can not occur in finite systems .",
    "thus , even though the agreement between the exact and the ea+2b solution seems better than ea+ex@xmath81 , it should be kept in mind that this result is due to unphysical effects .    with the ea+hyb method we observe a slightly better agreement in phase with the ea+ex@xmath81 treatment , but for the model considered here the improvement of local correlations brought by the exchange - correlation potential have a rather small overall effect .",
    "this points to the importance of non - local correlations for the desorption process , and to capture more closely the exact dynamics approximations beyond 2b ( or even inclusion of non - perturbative effects ) are necessary .",
    "as a first step in this direction we are currently working on including correlations in the @xmath118-matrix approximation .",
    "( green ) , ea+2b ( blue ) and ea+hyb ( orange).the first row shows results for the external field @xmath108 of amplitude @xmath109 with interaction strength @xmath119 and @xmath110 with interaction strength @xmath79 , and the second row gives the corresponding results for the field @xmath111 .",
    "]      finally , we contact the system to a semi - infinite lead and compare the resulting dynamics within ea+2b and ea+hyb to the corresponding finite system simulations ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : extendedelectron ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the addition of the particle reservoir seems to have a rather small impact on the short - time dynamics , both for the electronic and nuclear subsystem . at larger times the desorption probability decreases in the presence of a lead , since there is now an additional energy dissipation channel for the electrons that reduce the amount of energy transferred to the nuclei .",
    "however , for the nuclear part there is not much difference between the ea+2b and ea+hyb methods .",
    "the electron dynamics of the finite and extended systems show a qualitative agreement , the major difference being that the amplitude of the density oscillations decay faster in the latter case . for a contacted system",
    "the damping of electron oscillations is an inherent physical effect , in contrast to the artificial behavior discussed in the previous section . for the faster pulse @xmath113",
    "we also observe a slight dephasing of the ea+2b and ea+hyb solutions , favoring the ea+hyb method in both the finite and contacted case .",
    "the difference between the ea+2b ( or ea+hyb ) and the exact solution is typically greater than the difference between the finite and contacted solution within a given approximation scheme .",
    "this might imply that to model adsorbate - surface systems , and in particular non - perturbative processes such as desorption , it is more important to properly account for the electron - electron and electron - nuclear correlations close to the surface , than for the infinite extent of the system .",
    "this conclusion is strongly dependent on the parameters chosen , but for a strong electron - nuclear coupling ( so that the system is in the surface molecule limit ) we expect it to hold .     of amplitude @xmath110 with the interaction strength @xmath79 , and the second column gives the results for the external field @xmath111 of amplitude @xmath109 with the interaction strength @xmath107 . ]",
    "we present a model to treat real - time surface - adsorbate system dynamics induced by ultrafast laser pulses , and solve it exactly numerically in its finite size realisation .",
    "the exact results are compared to a treatment within the framework of negf , on the level of the second born approximation and also to a recently introduced hybrid negf / tddft approach . by the standard embedding procedure",
    "this allows us to also solve the semi - infinite version of our model . in the finite size case we treat the nuclear coordinate exactly using first quantisation , and",
    "compare it to the semi - classical case of having exact electronic dynamics and nuclear motion within the ehrenfest approximation .",
    "for the process of desorption , interesting due to its non - perturbative character , we find good qualitative agreement between the exact and ehrenfest nuclear dynamics when the exact result predicts either a very small or a very large desorption probability . in the intermediate case , characterized by a splitting of the nuclear wave packet into a bound and a quasi - free part of comparable magnitude , the ehrenfest",
    "treatment fails to reproduce the exact results . for the case of chemisorption considered here",
