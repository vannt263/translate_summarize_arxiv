    "millisecond pulsars ( msps ) significantly differ in properties from other ( ordinary ) radio pulsars .",
    "first of all , msps possess very short and stable spin periods , @xmath19 ms , with extremely small period derivatives , @xmath20 s s@xmath12 .",
    "these two main parameters separate msps from the majority of other pulsars , as illustrated in the @xmath21@xmath1 diagram shown in figure  1 . according to the conventional pulsar magnetic - braking model ,",
    "msps are very old neutron stars , with characteristic ages @xmath2210 gyr , and low surface magnetic fields @xmath23 g ( see fig .  1 ) . they were presumably spun up by angular momentum transfer during a mass accretion phase in binary systems ( e.g. , alpar et al .",
    "1982 ) , and their low values of @xmath24 could be explained by the ohmic and/or accretion - induced decay of magnetic field ( see cumming 2005 and references therein ) .",
    "discoveries of several accretion - driven binary msps , first of all the famous pulsar sax j1808.43658 with @xmath25 ms , support this hypothesis ( see , e.g. , wijnands 2004 for a review on accreting msps ) .    since the discovery of the first fast rotating pulsar b1937 + 21 by backer et al .",
    "( 1982 ) , msps have been extensively searched for and studied in radio domain .",
    "currently , about 130 msps are known ( manchester et al . 2005 ) . outside the radio band , as msps are intrinsically faint at optical wavelengths and most of them ( @xmath26% ) reside in binary systems with optically brighter white dwarf companions , the soft x - ray energy range ( @xmath010 kev ) is the main source of information on these pulsars . the detection of pulsed x - ray emission from the brightest ( and nearest ) msp j04374715 with @xmath27 ( becker & trmper 1993 ) initiated a series of dedicated x - ray observations of these intriguing objects in 90 s with this satellite and also @xmath28 , beppo@xmath29 and @xmath30 . later on this observational `` relay '' has been continued with  and .",
    "so far , firm x - ray detections have been reported for about three dozens of isolated ( solitary , or non - accreting if in binaries ) msps .",
    "the majority of these objects are located in globular clusters ( mostly 47  tuc  see bogdanov et al .",
    "this paper mainly concentrates on eight msps , listed in table  1 , with available detailed information on properties of detected x - ray emission . besides @xmath21 and @xmath31 , table  1 gives estimates on the distances to these objects , @xmath32 ( inferred from either pulsar parallaxes or dispersion measures and the ne2001 galactic electron density model by cordes & lazio 2003 ) kpc )",
    ", the distance estimates obtained from the pulsar parallaxes and those inferred from their dispersion measures agree well with each other ( see hotan , bails & ord 2006 and lommen et al .",
    "] , and on their spin - down energies , @xmath33 ( assuming a standard neutron star moment of inertia , @xmath34 g @xmath35 ) . note that for psr j10240719 the intrinsic period derivative is not well determined , @xmath36 s s@xmath12 ( hotan , bails & ord 2006 ) , that results in the lower and upper limits on @xmath31 and @xmath37 , respectively .    generally , x - ray emission from radio pulsars consists of two different components , thermal and nonthermal , generated on the neutron star surface or in its vicinity .",
    "the nonthermal component is usually described by a power - law ( pl ) spectral model and attributed to radiation produced by synchrotron and/or inverse compton processes in the pulsar magnetosphere , whereas the thermal emission can originate from either the whole surface of a cooling neutron star or small hot spots around the magnetic poles ( polar caps ; pcs ) on the star surface , or both .",
    "as predicted by virtually all pulsar models , these pcs can be heated up to x - ray temperatures ( @xmath38 mk ) by relativistic particles generated in pulsar acceleration zones .",
    "a conventional assumption about the pc radius is that it is close to the radius within which open magnetic field lines originate from the pulsar surface , @xmath39^{1/2}\\simeq 2\\,[p/5\\,{\\rm ms}]^{-1/2}$ ] km ( for a neutron star radius @xmath40 km ) . in case of msps ,",
    "the entire surface at a neutron star age of @xmath38 gyr is too cold , @xmath41 mk , to be detectable in x - rays ( although it may be seen in the @xmath42 band  see sec .",
    "therefore , only nonthermal ( magnetospheric ) and/or thermal pc radiation is expected to be observed in x - rays from these objects .",
    "in addition to the radiation produced by msps themselves , nonthermal emission from pulsar - wind nebulae ( pwne ) associated with msps moving at supersonic velocities ( @xmath43 km s@xmath12 ) through interstellar medium may be detected .",
    "another source of nonthermal x - ray radiation generated in binary systems can be an intrabinary shock formed where the pulsar wind and matter from the stellar component collide ( arons & tavani 1993 ) , although such a component would be hardly separated from radiation produced by the pulsar itself ( unless properties of the nonthermal emission varies with orbital phase ) .",
    "the msps in table  1 belong to two distinct groups : those which emit almost pure nonthermal radiation and those with a predominantly thermal pc component .",
    "the next two sections provides details on the x - ray properties of these objects .",
    "section  4 is devoted to three x - ray emitting msps whose properties remain uncertain .",
    "x - ray pwne powered by msps are briefly discussed in section  5 .",

    "of the msps listed in table  1 , these are psrs b1937 + 21 , b1957 + 20 , j0218 + 4232 , and b182124 .",
    "they are characterized by large values of spin - down energy , @xmath44 erg s@xmath12 , and shorter spin periods , @xmath45 ms .",
    "psr j0218 + 4232 is also one of few @xmath46-pulsars known ( kuiper et al . 2000 ) .",
    "x - ray observations of these msps revealed their nonthermal spectra , albeit with different photon indices @xmath47 .",
    "figures  25 show the spectra detected with  and/or from these msps .",
    "although the spectral data on these pulsars do not formally require any other component ( in addition to a pl ) , one can not exclude that there is also a contribution of thermal pc emission in the detected x - ray fluxes , as indicated in figures  25 . for psrs",
    "b182124 , j0218 + 4232 , and b1937 + 21 the measured photon indices are @xmath48@xmath49 .",
    "the spectrum of psr b1957 + 20 , was found to be much steeper , with @xmath50 ( although the x - ray radiation of this pulsar can consist of two component  see below ) .",
    "note that these estimates on @xmath47 are derived for the phase - integrated fluxes , whereas the observational data on psrs j0218 + 4232 and b1937 + 21 indicate that the spectral slope may change with pulsar rotational phase ( see webb , olive & barret 2004 and nicastro et al .",
    "2004 ) . however , much more sensitive observations are required to confirm this effect . regarding the x - ray spectrum of psr b182124 ( located in the globular cluster m28 ) , becker et al .",
    "( 2003 ) speculated that there is a marginal evidence for an emission line around 3.3 kev ( see also fig .  2 ) .",
    "if this feature is real , it could be interpreted as cyclotron emission from an optically thin corona above the pulsar provided its magnetic field is strongly different from a centered dipole .",
    "the estimated nonthermal ( isotropic ) luminosities of these four objects in the 0.2@xmath5110 kev range , @xmath52 , and the corresponding `` nonthermal '' efficiencies , @xmath53 , are given in table  2 .",
    "note that a fraction of the x - ray emission detected from the eclipsing pulsar b1957 + 20 , which is thought to ablate its companion in a close binary system with a 9.2-hr orbital period , may be due to an intrabinary shock between the pulsar wind and that of the companion star . the  data on this msp showed an apparent ( at a 99% confidence level ) modulation of the x - ray emission detected at the pulsar s position with orbital phase ( stappers et al .",
    "2003 ) , with lowest and highest fluxes during and immediately after eclipse ( respectively ) . assuming that this flux modulation is genuine , stappers et al .",
    "( 2003 ) obtained a 50% estimate on the contribution of x - ray emission from the intrabinary shock in the total flux detected from the pulsar .",
    "this fraction is accounted for in deriving the nonthermal luminosity and efficiency for psr b1957 + 20 given in table  2 .",
    "another prominent feature of the nonthermal emission from three of these msps is the shape of the x - ray pulsed profiles , with strong and narrow main pulses and large pulsed fractions @xmath54 ranging from about 65% for psr b02184232 up to nearly 100% for psrs b1937 + 21 and b182124 .",
    "figure  6 presents the pulsars light curves .",
    "nonthermal pulsed emission from these msps was also detected up to about 20 kev with @xmath30 ( rots et al .",
    "1998 ; kuiper , hermsen & stappers 2004 ; cusumano et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the main x - ray and radio peaks of these pulsars were found to be nearly aligned in phase ( based on both  and @xmath30 data ) .",
    "data that the main x - ray and radio pulses of psr b1937 + 21 are separated by @xmath55 in phase . ]",
    "this suggests that nonthermal photons emitted from these msps in the radio and x - ray bands are generated in the same ( or close ) zones , although it still remains unclear where those zones are located : closer to the neutron star surface ( as suggested by the polar - cap model of harding , usov & muslimov 2005 ) or near the pulsar light cylinder ( according to the outer - gap model  e.g. , cheng , ho & ruderman 1986 , romani 1996 ) .",
    "pulsations of the x - ray flux emitted by psr b1957 + 20 have to be detected yet .",
    "this is the second group of objects in table  1 which consists of psrs j0030 + 0451 , j21243358 , j10240719 , and j04374715 .",
    "these msps are less energetic in terms of @xmath37 , have longer spin periods and are much closer to earth .",
    "x - ray spectra of the two brightest members of this group , psrs j0030 + 0451 and j04374715 can not be fitted with a single pl model , whereas for the other two pulsars such a fit yields too large photon indices , @xmath564 , and the obtained estimates on hydrogen column density , @xmath57@xmath58 @xmath59 , towards these objects greatly exceed those inferred from independent measurements ( zavlin 2006 ) . a broken - pl model , suggested by becker & aschenbach ( 2002 ) to interpret the spectra of psrs j0030 + 0451 and j04374715 , results in unrealistic estimates on @xmath60 .",
    "a model involving a pl and a simple one - temperature thermal component also faces the same problem .    analyzing @xmath27 data on",
    ", zavlin & pavlov ( 1998 ) suggested a thermal model implying a nonuniform temperature distribution over pcs .",
    "these authors discussed that relativistic particles bombarding magnetic poles of an msp could heat a region larger than the conventional pc size ( see sec .",
    "1 ) because the low magnetic field of the pulsar does not prevent the released heat from propagating along the neutron star surface .",
    "the applied model assumes two identical pcs on magnetic poles covered with a weakly magnetized hydrogen atmosphere ( zavlin , pavlov & shibanov 1996 ) .",
    "it also takes into account the gr effects ( redshift and bending of photon trajectories near the neutron star surface ) . in this model",
    "the thermal radiation depends on pc temperature and radius , the neutron star mass - to - radius ratio , which determines the gr effects , and the star geometry ( the viewing and magnetic angles , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively ) .",
    "the sketch shown in figure  7 illustrates the neutron star geometry and the effect of light bending ( see also , e.g. , zavlin , shibanov & pavlov 1995 for more details on the gr effects on pulsar pc emission ) .",
    "the nonuniform temperature was approximated with a step - like function , referred as pc `` core '' and `` rim '' .",
    "observations of  with  ( zavlin et al .",
    "2002 ) and  ( zavlin 2006 ) showed that such a model , supplemented with a pl component of @xmath63 , fits well the spectrum of  up to 10 kev and yields reasonable pulsar parameters as well as @xmath60 .",
    "the thermal model provides the bulk of the pulsar s x - ray flux , whereas the pl component prevails only at photon energies @xmath64 kev .",
    "a similar ( nonuniform pcs plus pl ) model works also well on the spectral data of psr j0030 + 0451 .",
    "figures  8 and 9 demonstrate this .",
    "the inferred parameters of the thermal components are : @xmath65 and 2.1 mk , @xmath66 and 0.8 mk , @xmath67 and 0.1 km , @xmath68 and 1.4 km , for psrs j04374715 and",
    "j0030 + 0451 , respectively ( in the latter case the pl index was fixed at @xmath69 because of a poorer data statistics at higher energies ) . for psrs",
    "j21243358 and j10240719 the same model yields pc parameters close to those mentioned above , although low quality of the observational data on these two objects at @xmath70 kev allows one to put only upper limits on intensity of the nonthermal component ( zavlin 2006 ) . the bolometric luminosities of one pc , @xmath71 , and `` pc efficiencies '' , @xmath72 , can be found in table  2 , together with the estimates on @xmath52 and @xmath73 for the nonthermal component ( or corresponding 1@xmath74 upper limits ) .",
    "upper limits on the luminosity of a possible thermal pc component in the x - ray fluxes of the four nonthermally emitting pulsars ( sec .  2 ) are also given in table  2 .",
    "note that a more detailed study of possible thermal emission from these four pulsars is hampered by large distances ( a few kpc ) and , hence , strong interstellar absorption ( @xmath75-@xmath76\\times 10^{21}$ ] @xmath59 ) towards these objects .     and @xmath77 , and viewing and magnetic angles @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( respectively ) .",

    "for example , in the framework of the conventional pulsar model with the magnetic dipole at the neutron star center , psr j0030 + 0451 can be a nearly orthogonal rotator ( i.e. , @xmath94 ) with two pulses in its light curve being due to contributions from two pcs seen during the pulsar s rotation .",
    "for the other msps , the bulk of the detected x - ray fluxes is expected to come mostly from one pc .",

    "a feasible interpretation is that the observed asymmetry in the pulsed profiles of these three msps is caused by contribution of the nonthermal component whose peak is shifted in phase with respect to the pulse of the thermal emission .",
    "results of the energy - resolved timing and phase - resolved spectroscopy on the  data on  support this explanation ( zavlin 2006 ) . for psr j21243358",
    ", there may be an alternative interpretation of the shape of the pulsar s light curve : the steeper rise and longer trail could be caused by relativistic effects ( in particular , the doppler boost ) in fast rotating pulsars ( braje , romani & rauch 2000 ) , although it then should be understood why these effects are not seen in the pulse profiles of the other three msps whose the spin periods close to that of psr j21243358 ( table  1 ) . another way to attempt to explain the observed light curves is to involve a model with a decentered magnetic dipole ( or another magnetic field configuration",
    " see the presentation by s. zane at this conference ) , what has not been done yet for interpreting pulsed x - ray emission from msps . in any case",
    ", to produce a pulsed fraction at a level of @xmath95 , thermal emission has to be anisotropic , as predicted by neutron star atmosphere models , to counteract the effect of light bending near the star surface on pulsations of the thermal flux ( zavlin , shibanov & pavlov 1995 ) .",
    "so far , the difference in phases between radio and x - ray pulses was determined only for  based on  data ( zavlin et al .",
    "2002 ; see also fig .",
    "as the bulk of the x - ray flux from this pulsar is of the thermal pc origin , the small difference in phases of the radio and x - ray peaks suggests that the pulsar s radio emission is generated close to the neutron star surface , unless the effects of field - line sweepback and/or aberration cancel the travel - time difference .",

    "the numbers presented in table  2 indicate that the larger is @xmath37 , the higher is the `` nonthermal '' efficiency @xmath73 , whereas the opposite tendency is apparent for @xmath116 .",
    "a similar behavior of @xmath116 follows from results of the theoretical modeling of the pc heating by returning positrons produced through curvature radiation and inverse compton scattering ( see figs .  7 and 8 in harding & muslimov 2001 and 2002 , respectively , with account for the relation @xmath121/[n-1]}=\\tau^{-2}$ ] , for the magneto - dipole braking index @xmath122 ) .",
    "in addition , high luminosity of the nonthermal emission may be associated with large values of the magnetic field at the pulsar light cylinder ( saito et al .",
    "1997 ) , @xmath123 ^ 3 $ ] .",
    "indeed , the nonthermally emitting msps possess magnetic fields , @xmath124@xmath125 g , close to that of the crab pulsar ( @xmath126 g ) and exceeding those in the msps with thermal emission ( as well as in psrs j0751 + 1807 and j1012 + 5307 ) , @xmath127 g , at least by an order of magnitude .",
    "this may indicate that the nonthermal radiation of msps is generated in emission zone(s ) close to the light cylinder ( as predicted by the outer - gap pulsar models ) and that @xmath128 is an important parameter governing the magnetospheric activity . on the other hand , a model by harding , usov & muslimov ( 2005 ) for acceleration and pair cascades on open field lines close to pulsar",
    "pcs describes rather well the spectrum of psr j0218 + 4232 observed from x - rays through @xmath46-rays .",
    "hence , at the present stage , neither of the two models ( outer - gap or polar - cap ) of the nonthermal emission of msps could be regarded as more favorable . besides",
    ", one can not rule out that the pulsar spin period also affects @xmath73  the msps of the first group have shorter periods than those of the other four pulsars ( table  1 ) . definitely , a bigger sample of x - ray emitting msps is required to draw more conclusive speculations .",
    "the results of section  3 point out that pcs of msps are likely nonuniform , with temperatures decreasing by a factor of 23 from the pc center down to its edge .",
    "there have not been yet reliable calculations of the temperature distribution around the pulsar magnetic poles .",
    "hence , sophisticated theoretical models of pc heating and temperature distribution are required for further investigation of thermal x - ray emission from msps .    as shown by pavlov & zavlin ( 1997 ) , modeling of an x - ray pulsed profile",
    "can yield constraints on the pulsar mass - to - radius ratio as well as its geometry . to do",
    "that , more elaborated models of magnetospheric pulsed emission and data of a better quality at higher energies are required to disentangle nonthermal and thermal components .    and  provided remarkable detections of two double - neutron - star binary systems with msps as companions , j07373039 and j1537 + 1155 ( campana , possentti & burgay 2004 ; mclaughlin et al . 2004 ;",
    "pellizzioni et al . 2004 ; kargaltsev , pavlov & garmire 2006 ) .",
    "although the collected data are of a rather scanty statistics , one could conclude that the inferred x - ray spectra and luminosities of these two system are similar , suggesting the same mechanisms generating the detected radiation . among various interpretations proposed",
    ", the most plausible one is that the observed emission consists of a thermal pc component emitted by the msps plus nonthermal x - rays from the interaction of the pulsar winds with the neutron star companions .",
    "this interpretation explains a gap observed in the orbital dependence of the x - ray flux emitted by the highly eccentric j1537 + 1155 system ( kargaltsev , pavlov & garmire 2006 ) . to investigate these systems in more detail , a phase - resolved spectroscopy on x - ray data of a better quality",
    "is required to separate possible components in x - rays from these objects .",
    "further observations are expected to constrain both the properties of the pulsar winds and those of the pulsars themselves in these ( and other ) double - neutron - star systems .",
    "so far , only one msp , j04374715 , has been observed and detected in the @xmath42 band ( kargaltsev , pavlov & romani 2004 ) .",
    "the shape of the inferred spectrum suggests thermal emission from the whole neutron star surface of a surprisingly high temperature of about 0.1 mk .",
    "a heating mechanism should be operating in a gyr - old neutron star to keep its surface at such temperature .",
    "as discussed by kargaltsev , pavlov & romani ( 2004 ) , among several possible mechanisms ( both internal and external ) , chemical heating ( reisenegger 1995 ) and frictional heating ( e.g. , cheng et al .",
    "1992 ) of the neutron star core are the most plausible options . to understand thermal evolution of neutron stars , more msps ( e.g. , the other three pulsars discussed in sec .  3 ) and close ordinary old pulsars ( psr b0950 + 08 is one of the best candidates",
    " zavlin & pavlov 2004 ) should be observed in the @xmath42 band .",
    "the example of  shows that such an observational program would be feasible .    as a final remark",
    ", it is worth mentioning that so far all known isolated ( non - accreting ) msps were first discovered in radio . in x - rays a first attempt to find millisecond pulsations from an isolated compact object was done by zavlin & pavlov ( 2006 ) who suggested that the most famous ( and intriguing ) member of the group of the `` dim '' isolated , radio - quite , and thermally emitting neutron stars discovered with @xmath27 ( see the presentation by f. haberl at this conference ) , rx  j1856.53754 , could be an msp ( see pavlov & zavlin 2003 for a discussion ) .",
    "one of the reasons to look for millisecond pulsations was the fact that the x - ray flux detected from this object in deep observations with and  revealed no pulsations at periods above 20 ms ( the period range to which those observational data were sensitive ) , with a stringent upper limit on the pulsed fraction @xmath129 . to check the msp hypothesis , a deep  observation of rx  j1856.53754 in an instrumental model with a temporal resolution of 0.03 ms",
    "was conducted in april 2004 . despite a very large number of source counts collected in this observation ( @xmath130 ) ,",
    "no significant pulsations were found at periods in the range @xmath13120 ms .",
    "the derived 1@xmath74 upper limit on the pulsed flux for this period range is @xmath132 .",
    "this nondetection virtually excludes the msp interpretation for rx  j1856.53754 and supports alternative hypotheses of a very special neutron star s geometry and/or a very long spin period ( @xmath133 hr ) .",
