    "then the 5-ghz image was slightly shifted to account for the frequency - dependent core shift .",
    "the apparent change in the core position in flat - spectrum radio quasars is due to the frequency - dependent opacity in synchrotron self - absorbed compact jets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as shown by @xcite on the basis of 9-frequency analysis of vlbi - scale structures in 20 agn between the observing frequencies of 1.6 and 15  ghz , the core shift effect is considerably more prominent at the lower frequencies . in their study , the average value of the core displacement between 1.6 and 5  ghz was 0.88 mas .",
    "the displacement shows a systematic direction along the jet : in all sources , 1.6-ghz cores are found to be closer to the outermost optically thin components than their 5-ghz counterparts .",
    "the sources studied by @xcite are distributed within the redshift range from 0.056 to 2.707 . given a clear trend of decrease of the core shift with the increasing frequency ( fig .  3 in * ? ? ?",

    "our observed frequencies correspond to @xmath110  ghz and 31  ghz .",
    "the images could in principle be aligned using the positions of optically thin jet components seen at both frequencies . in our case , this proved uncertain since the jet has a complex structure with several components that are difficult to cross - identify in the two images with sufficient positional accuracy . a more sophisticated method developed by @xcite would maximize a cross - correlation function between the two images of the entire optically thin region of the jet to estimate a core shift .",
    "here we applied a somewhat similar but simpler method .",
    "we transferred the circular gaussian model components describing the 1.7-ghz brightness distribution ( table  [ lband - modelfit ] ) to the 5-ghz data , and fixed the positions of these components .",
    "we then performed a new modelfit in difmap , allowing only the jet component sizes , the flux densities , and , for the point - like core component , also the position to vary .",
    "the resulting difference in the position of the 1.6-ghz and 5-ghz core ( 0.57mas ) is consistent with the expected value ( @xmath31mas ) as described above on the basis of the analysis by @xcite .",

    "the spectral index in the core region is @xmath8 .",
    "its sign is consistent with the value derived from the fitted flux densites of the point - like core component ( @xmath28=@xmath29 ) .",
    "the difference in the spectral indices obtained by the two methods could be attributed to resolution effects , i.e. the blending of the core and the innermost jet component ( table  [ cband - modelfit ] ) in the 5-ghz image restored with a more extended beam .",
    "the integral flux densities in our vlbi components ( 180.4  mjy at 1.7  ghz and 79.2  mjy at 5 ghz ) are about 2040 per cent smaller than the total flux density values obtained from the literature .",
    "this indicates the presence of jet emission on angular scales of @xmath1100  mas which is resolved out by our vlbi observations .",

    "this claim @xcite was based on the best - fitting brightness distribution model of the vlba data with an elongated central elliptical gaussian component .",
    "the evn observation at 5  ghz presented in this paper used longer interferometer baselines and therefore achieved finer angular resolution compared to the earlier vlba experiment @xcite .",

    ", the radio core ( i.e. the base of the inner jet with optical depth of unity at the given frequency ) can now be more reliably resolved into , and fitted with a point - like compact component and a nearby circular gaussian ( components a2 and b2 in table  [ cband - modelfit ] and fig .",

    "alternatively , the jet may follow a curved ( helical ) trajectory , like in the case of e.g. j1159 + 2914 @xcite . however , vlbi imaging data from just two epochs are not sufficient to investigate this .",
    "for the first time , at least tentatively , we could estimate the apparent speed of the jet components in j1026 + 2542 .",
    "the jet speeds for the three components with significant values are consistent with being equal within the uncertainties ( table  [ properm ] ) . for the following calculations ,",
    "we adopt the median value , @xmath44=12.5 , as the one representative of the beam speed . in turn , the doppler factor we can estimate from the measured core brightness temperature lower limit , @xmath50  k. for this , we first have to assume a value for the intrinsic brightness temperature ( @xmath51 ) .",

    "<S> the prominent jet structure allows us to identify individual components whose apparent displacement can be detected over the time span of 7.33  yr . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first time when jet proper motions are directly derived in a blazar at @xmath0@xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the small values of up to @xmath10.1  masyr@xmath3 are consistent with what is expected in a relativistic cosmological model if redshift is a measure of distance . </S>",
