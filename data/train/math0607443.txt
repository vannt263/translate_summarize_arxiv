    "for a simple example posed by v. i. arnold @xcite , the existence of the so - called arnold diffusion has been proved ( see e.g. @xcite @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the argument involves two parts : a calculation of the melnikov - arnold integrals @xcite and a transversal intersection argument @xcite supported by a @xmath0-lemma @xcite .",
    "other arguments of variational type were also developed @xcite",
    "@xcite @xcite @xcite .    nevertheless , the theory of arnold diffusion is far from complete @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "the main challenge is dealing with high dimensional specific systems of interest in applications . when the dimensions of the kam tori are large , more melnikov - arnold integrals are needed to establish arnold diffusion . calculating these integrals",
    "is a dauting task if not impossible , even with computers . in an infinite dimensional phase space , even the dimensions of the kam tori",
    "become a challenging issue .",
    "are there infinite dimensional kam tori ? in what form ? in the classical setting of a banach space with angles - momenta coordinates , the challenge is how to deal with the perturbation v.s . the decay of the sequence of momenta .",
    "it is a very interesting problem .",
    "the aim of the current article is to draw attention to two canonical systems of mathematical physics : the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation ( dnls ) and its continuous version  the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) .",
    "dnls and nls are integrable systems that describe many different phenomena in physics @xcite .",
    "dnls is an integrable finite difference discretization of nls .",
    "an interesting fact about dnls is that one can choose and change the dimensions of the phase space by selecting the number of particles in the discretization .",
    "for a two particle case , under periodic hamiltonian perturbations , the resulting system is 5-dimensional , for which the existence of arnold diffusion will be proved here . for a three particle case , the system is 7-dimensional , and will be a good testing ground for a higher dimensional theory .",

    "the reason is that one can utilize locally invariant center manifolds instead of kam tori . for the purpose of arnold diffusion , local invariance ( i.e. orbits can only enter or leave the submanifold through its boundaries ) is not enough .",
