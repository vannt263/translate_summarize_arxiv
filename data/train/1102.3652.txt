    "the electromagnetic form factor of pion is an interesting quantity to investigate in lattice qcd .",
    "experimentally it has been measured in a set of experiments @xcite .",
    "together with the nucleon form factors , it provides the first important test case of our understanding of hadron structure that arises from the quark content . from lattice qcd point of view ,",
    "form factor calculations represent one of the first steps going beyond static quantities like the mass spectrum which require only two - point functions .",
    "the pion form factor is a natural first choice in this direction since usually pion green s functions are statistically the most stable quantities in lattice qcd measurements .",
    "an interesting point with the pion form factor @xmath10 is its slope at the origin as a function of the momentum transfer squared @xmath11 , _",
    "i.e. , _ the pion charge radius defined by @xmath12 it has been known for some time from chiral perturbation theory analysis @xcite that this quantity diverges logarithmically with vanishing pion mass squared",
    ". quantitative confirmation of such a behavior would provide an important check on the control of chiral behavior in lattice qcd simulations toward the physical point .",
    "the pioneering lattice qcd calculations of the pion form factor appeared more than 20 years ago @xcite , and a number of studies were carried out over the years .",
    "recently , with the development of simulations with dynamical quarks , several groups have attempted calculations with @xmath13 @xcite and @xmath0 @xcite dynamical flavors using a variety of quark actions .",
    "the @xmath13 calculations employed wilson - clover @xcite , twisted mass @xcite or overlap @xcite quark action , and explored the pion mass region down to @xmath6  mev . the values for @xmath14 from those simulations are significantly smaller than the experimental value , and nnlo fits of su(2 ) chiral perturbation theory were needed to find consistency with it at the physical pion mass . for @xmath0 dynamical flavors ,",
    "there has been a single calculation employing domain - wall quark action @xcite , which made measurements at a single pion mass of @xmath6  mev .",
    "carrying out nlo analyses in su(2 ) and su(3 ) chiral perturbation theory , this work found @xmath14 to be consistent with the experimental value at the upper edge of a 10% error band .",
    "in this paper we present our calculation of the electromagnetic form factor of pion in @xmath0 dynamical flavor qcd using the wilson - clover quark action . for measurements we employ the @xmath0 pacs - cs gauge configurations generated on a @xmath15 lattice using the iwasaki gauge action and the wilson - clover action at a lattice spacing estimated to be @xmath2  fm at the physical point @xcite .",
    "since the pion mass on this gauge configuration set covers the range from @xmath16mev down to @xmath17  mev , we are able to examine both the known range above @xmath6mev and a novel range below toward the physical pion mass .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  2 we present our method to calculate the pion form factor .",
    "in order to access the region of small momentum transfer , we use the method of partially twisted boundary condition @xcite , and in order to fight increasing computational cost for smaller pion mass , we apply the method of random wall source @xcite . in addition",
    "we make use of a judicious choice of momenta carried by the incoming and outgoing quarks off the electromagnetic vertex , which helps in reducing statistical fluctuations in the form factor measurements . in sec .",
    "3 we present the results of pion form factor measurements , and in sec .",
    "4 we analyze the data as a function of the momentum transfer squared and pion mass . in particular we examine consistency with the predictions of chiral perturbation theory . finally , in sec .  5",
    ", we discuss our findings closer to the physical point including the results of our test calculation on a @xmath8 lattice with the quark masses tuned to the neighbour of the physical point .",
    "we end this work with conclusions in sec .",
    "a preliminary report of this work was presented in @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic pion form factor @xmath18 is defined by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the four - momentum transfer , and @xmath21 is the electromagnetic current given in @xmath0 qcd by @xmath22 in the limit of vanishing four - momentum transfer @xmath23 , the form factor equals unity due to the charge conservation .",
    "we extract the form factor from a suitable ratio of the pion two- and three - point functions .",
    "we use a ratio , which has the advantage of simultaneously reducing fluctuations and renormalizing the current , defined as @xmath24 which converges as @xmath25 for large @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 denotes pion energy for spatial momentum @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the three - point function with momenta @xmath29 at the source and @xmath31 at the sink @xmath27 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the two - point function , @xmath34 after contraction of quark fields , the three - point function consists of the connected and disconnected contributions .",
    "the latter vanishes after the gauge field average due to charge conjugation invariance , and hence need not be calculated . since we assume degeneracy of up and down quark masses in the present calculation , the connected contribution is equal to @xmath35\\right>.\\ ] ] this contribution can be calculated by the traditional source method @xcite .",
    "the ratio ( [ eq : ratio ] ) makes use of two- and three - point functions in an appropriate combination to extract the form factor for the renormalized current .",
    "the presence of ratios guarantee that statistical fluctuations are suppressed .",
    "nonetheless , making simple choices such as @xmath36 and @xmath37 , we have observed an increasingly larger fluctuation of the ratio as pion mass is reduced , and this trend worsens for larger momenta . with an interesting choice of momenta ,",
    "@xmath38 but @xmath39 , the ratio ( [ eq : ratio ] ) simplifies to @xmath40 since the two - point functions as well as the ratio of energies drop out , leaving just the ratio of three - point functions , we expect this choice to yield better signals than those choices for which all factors are present .",
    "furthermore , one can choose 6 permutations in momentum directions while keeping @xmath39 , gaining more statistics .",
    "the minimum non - zero quark momentum @xmath41 for the periodic boundary condition on a @xmath15 lattice with a 2  gev inverse lattice spacing is about 0.4  gev . to probe the region of smaller momentum transfer as well as to improve the resolution of four - momentum transfer ,",
    "we apply the method of partially twisted boundary condition @xcite in which valence quark fields are subjected to twisted boundary condition while periodic boundary condition is kept for sea quark fields .",
    "if one imposes the boundary condition given by @xmath42 on a valence quark field , the spatial momentum of that quark is quantized according to @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the spatial lattice size , @xmath45 the unit vector in the spatial @xmath46-th direction and @xmath47 real parameter . in this way",
    "one can explore arbitrarily small momentum on the lattice by adjusting the value of twist @xmath47 .",
    "for the meson two - point function consisting of quark and anti - quark propagators , we apply the twist only to quark and not to antiquark or vice versa .",
    "similarly , for the three - point function , we twist only one or two out of the three quark propagators . in other words , we pretend that each valence quark line in the two- and three - point function quark diagrams carry a different flavor and select the appropriate flavor to apply twisting . in this way",
    "we can avoid a twist of a quark line cancelled by the opposite twist of the antiquark line carrying the same flavor @xcite .",
    "this procedure and the twisting of only valence quarks mean that we deal with partially quenched qcd with a different flavor symmetry content in the valence and sea quark sectors .",
    "as was discussed in detail in @xcite using chiral perturbation theory , the associated effects are expected to appear as finite - size effects exponentially small in spatial volume for channels which do not have final - state interactions such as three - point functions for form factor calculations . since terms of such magnitude are also present in unitary theory with periodic valence and sea quarks ,",
    "we ignore this issue in the present work .",
    "the twisted boundary condition can be imposed on a periodic quark field configuration by the following transformation @xmath48 in practice we transfer the twist from the quark sector to the gluon sector by an @xmath49 transformation on the spatial gluon link fields given by @xmath50 thus valence quark propagators are solved with the periodic boundary condition but on the pacs - cs gauge configurations twisted by the u(1 ) transformation above .    in order to check that the term @xmath51 acts as true physical momentum , we carried out a test of the energy - momentum dispersion relation of the pion on some pacs - cs configurations .",
    "of the two valence quarks inside the pion , we twisted one quark with a twist angle @xmath52 and left the other untwisted . in fig .",
    "[ fig : checktbc13700](a ) we plot the effective energy for the ground state , two values of the twist angle and their combination with the first integer momenta at the hopping parameters @xmath53 , @xmath54 where @xmath55  mev .",
    "the propagator is fitted over @xmath56 to extract the energy @xmath57 .",
    "errors are estimated by the jackknife method with the bin size of 100 trajectories .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : checktbc13700](b ) , together with the expected behavior , @xmath58 which demonstrates clearly that the term @xmath51 acts as true physical momentum .",
    "the two data points on the right represent combinations of an integer momentum @xmath59 and a twist .",
    "the energy - momentum relation is correctly reproduced in this case as well .      at light quark masses",
    "the computing cost for inversion of dirac operator becomes very expensive .",
    "thus we have employed some improvements for obtaining the form factor with acceptable statistical errors at reasonable computing time .",
    "the first improvement is to utilize the random wall source .",
    "this method has a long history and has been applied to two - point functions in a variety of contexts .",
    "more recently , applications to three - point functions have shown their effectiveness for form factor calculations @xcite .",
    "we consider the use of @xmath60 random noisy source as introduced in @xcite .",
    "consider a set of random sources whose real and imaginary components are randomly chosen from @xmath61 for each site , color and spin , @xmath62 this set has the property that in the limit @xmath63 @xmath64 to use this kind of source in calculating correlators , one can choose it to be a set of random wall source located at @xmath65 , @xmath66 @xmath67 making use of ( [ eq : impr5 ] ) to rewrite the pion two - point function at zero momentum as , @xmath68   d^{-1\\dagger}_{c\\kappa , a\\alpha}(\\vec{y},t ; \\vec{z},t_0 ) \\big)\\\\ & = & \\sum_{\\vec{y } } \\left < \\psi^{(n)}(\\vec{y},t|t_0 ) \\psi^{\\dagger(n)}(\\vec{y},t|t_0 ) \\right>_n,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the solution vector of the dirac equation , @xmath70     +    with a random @xmath60 wall source the solution for quark propagator needs only single inversion instead of @xmath71 corresponding to color and dirac components required for a point source or smeared source . when the number of configurations in the ensemble is large enough , even if one uses a single random source for each configuration , ( [ eq : impr5 ] ) is expected to hold in the ensemble average .",
    "one may expect to obtain meson correlators of a similar statistical quality as with the traditional point source with only 1/12 of computing time .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : c2ptpointvsz2 ] , we compare the effective pion mass plot calculated on a set of 10 configurations at @xmath72 ( @xmath73mev ) from the pacs - cs ensemble using ( a ) point source , ( b ) single random @xmath60 wall source , and ( c ) smeared source .",
    "we observe that the signal with the random @xmath60 wall source is somewhat better than that for point source , while the signal for smeared source is better than that with the random @xmath60 wall source .",
    "using 4 random wall sources for each configuration , we observed that the quality of signal becomes comparable to that for smeared source .",
    "since the computing time is still @xmath74 for the random wall source , we employ the method of random wall source with 4 sets of random wall sources in our measurements .",
    "in addition we repeat measurements with the source located at @xmath75 since the time extent of our lattice is 64 .",
    "we apply our calculational setup to a subset of the pacs - cs gauge configurations @xcite corresponding to the degenerate up - down hopping parameter in the set @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "the hopping parameter of strange quark is fixed at @xmath80 .",
    "the first set of measurements , which we call data set i , is made with an exponentially smeared source and local sink , setting the final pion at zero momentum @xmath81 and varying that of the initial pion @xmath29 in the three - point function .",
    "the fixed sink time @xmath27 in the ratio ( [ eq : ratio ] ) needs to be chosen large enough to eliminate excited states contributions .",
    "however , statistical fluctuations increase as @xmath27 increases , and examining measurement results , we choose @xmath82 to balance the two opposite features .",
    "the twist technique is applied to the quark running from the source to the current .",
    "two values are chosen for the twist angle @xmath83 such that the smallest four - momentum transfer of the current takes the value @xmath84 or @xmath85 .",
    "adding integer momenta , we then collect data for @xmath86 in the range @xmath87 .",
    "the statistics of data set i is given in table [ table : stat_dataset1 ] together with pion and kaon mass .",
    "results of data set i have been previously reported in @xcite .    in order to extract the form factor",
    ", we fit the plateau of the ratio @xmath88 by a constant .",
    "the fitting range should be chosen around the symmetry point between the source and the sink , with additional considerations on the time interval required for the pion state to become dominant .",
    "since we employ an exponential smeared source and a point sink , we shift the fitting range one time unit closer to the source than the symmetric point @xmath89 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : plateau_pff](a ) we plot the ratio @xmath88 at various momentum transfer for the pion mass @xmath55  mev . at this pion mass",
    "we have good signals for all 7 values of the four - momentum transfer .",
    "there is a good plateau from @xmath90 to 15 for every momentum transfer .",
    "thus at this pion mass we can choose the fitting range from @xmath90 to 15 to extract the form factor .",
    "however , as the pion mass decreases , the plateau signal becomes worse as exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig : plateau_pff_296](a ) for the lightest case of @xmath91  mev where the ratio @xmath88 at the two smallest momentum transfers , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , is shown .",
    "we then choose larger values for the starting point of the fitting range for better suppression of excited states at lighter pion masses .",
    "the error is estimated by the jackknife method using 10 configurations corresponding to 50 hybrid molecular dynamics time units as the bin size after checking saturation of the magnitude of error as function of bin size .",

    "it is very difficult to find a stable fit in the 5-dimension parameter space .",
    "therefore we fix @xmath96 at the phenomenology values since they were calculated with small error bar from experimental data@xcite . for @xmath97 , which is only required in the formulation with @xmath98 , we apply the value obtained by an nlo fit of data in the range @xmath99  mev by the pacs - cs collaboration@xcite .",
    "we find that stable fits are difficult to obtain unless we utilize data at more than a single pion mass in the fit procedure .",
    "the fit result obtained with data for the two pion masses @xmath100 and 411  mev , which were used for the nlo analysis , is listed in table [ table : pff_chpt_su2_nnlo_2lightest ] and shown in figs .  [ fig : chpt_su2_nnlo_2lightest - f ] and [ fig : chpt_su2_nnlo_2lightest - fpi ] .",
    "combining the data at the two pion masses is acceptable since strange quark mass does not vary much , @xmath101 and 92.2(1.3 )  mev at @xmath100 and 411  mev , respectively @xcite .",
    "we observe that the results for @xmath102 are consistent between the two fits within the error of 1015% and so are the predictions for the squared charge radius at the physical point , indicating that chpt reasonably converges at nnlo up to @xmath103  mev and @xmath104  gev@xmath105 .",

    "the squared charge radius predicted at the physical point is close to the experimental value and is consistent within statistics errors of 10% .",
    "while chpt to nnlo yields a reasonable result for the physical pion charge radius , the estimated error of 10% is quite large .",
    "we feel that for a convincing understanding of the physical pion charge radius one needs to explore the region of pion mass closer to the physical point than the value @xmath6  mev analyzed so far .",
    "the pacs - cs gauge configurations has one more set corresponding to @xmath106 .",
    "we tried to calculate the form factor on this set , and found that the pion two- and three - point correlators exhibit very large fluctuations , to the extent that taking a meaningful statistical average is difficult .",
    "this trend becomes more pronounced as the twist carried by quarks becomes larger . since @xmath107 at this pion mass for @xmath108 , we suspect that this phenomenon is caused by a small size of the lattice relative to the pion mass , and consequent increase of large fluctuations .    a natural remedy to",
    "this difficulty is to employ larger lattices as one moves toward the physical pion mass .",

    "we used the same setup as for the data set ii , namely , ( i ) the incoming and outgoing pions in the three - point function carry momenta of the same magnitude @xmath39 but point in different directions , ( ii ) 4 random @xmath60 wall sources located at @xmath75 are employed , ( iii ) the twist technique is applied to the two quarks running from the source to the current and from the current to the sink , and ( iv ) four values are chosen for the twist angle @xmath110 and its permutations such that the four - momentum transfer of the current takes the value @xmath111 .",

    "center lines exhibit pacs - cs estimation of pion mass calculated from larger statistics of 53 configurations . ]    since we use 4 random sources for each of the 4 locations of the source in time , our measurement on 4 configurations gives 64 two - point functions .",
    "the pion effective mass from our measurement together with the pacs - cs estimate of pion mass calculated from larger statistics of 53 configurations is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : c2ptdata_64latt ] .",
    "although only 4 configurations have been used , one can already observe a plateau - like behavior for pion effective mass in this figure .",

    "while the error is too large to seriously discuss consistency with experiment , it is certainly encouraging that the value is larger than those obtained at @xmath118 of about 300  mev , and that the physical point simulation appears possible for the pion electromagnetic form factor on a @xmath8 lattice .",

    "we have utilized some improved techniques besides traditional methods for the form factor calculation .",
    "we have shown that , choosing momenta of the incoming and outgoing pions to have the same magnitude but different directions , the ratio for extracting the pion form factor becomes statistically much better behaved .",
