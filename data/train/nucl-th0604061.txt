    "<S> + one of the most actual topics in nuclear physics in the energy region of a few gev is the investigation of the excitation and the structure of excited states of the nucleon , i.e. , the investigation of @xmath3 baryon resonances @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one experimental tool to study these excitations is the exclusive ( near threshold ) production of selective baryon resonances on the nucleon with hadronic or electromagnetic beams . </S>",
    "<S> currently , such experiments are currently vigorously pursued with protons at cosy ( up to last year also at celsius ) @xcite and with electrons at mami , elsa , cebaf , bes and hermes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + as a characteristic feature , </S>",
    "<S> heavy meson production , even at threshold , involves large momentum transfers of typically 1 gev / c ; consequently , such reactions probe the short range dynamics of the baryon - baryon system . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> meson - exchange calculations at such large momentum transfers are in general not dominated by the single pion - exchange : for a quantitative description , the exchange of all mesons with masses up to typically 1 gev , i.e. , the exchange of the goldstone bosons @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , of the vector mesons @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and of the @xmath12-dominated scalar mesons @xmath13 and @xmath14 have to be included explicitly @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as the relative phases and the form factors of the corresponding meson-@xmath0 vertices are in general unknown , even in the cleanest single - meson production reaction , such as the near - threshold @xmath7 and @xmath15 production , which are dominated , respectively , by the excitation of the @xmath3(1535 ) and @xmath3(1650 ) resonances @xcite , the model predictions depend sensitively on the _ ad hoc _ interplay between the various meson exchanges @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> examples for near - threshold @xmath7-production show a characteristic uncertainty up to one order of magnitude in exploring the relative phases between the different mesons@xcite . an additional , equally drastic uncertainty is the highly unknown behavior of the different meson - baryon transition vertices if continued far off - shell into the space - like region . </S>",
    "<S> + of course , there are prescriptions in the literature , specifying both diagonal and non - diagonal mesonic nucleon couplings to baryon resonances with arbitrary spins and positive or negative parity , and the relative phases between different meson - induced transition vertices @xcite . for the transition to negative parity , </S>",
    "<S> spin 1/2 , baryon resonances , which we investigate in this note , i.e. for @xmath16 @xmath17 vertices ( @xmath18 denotes scalar , pseudo - scalar or vector mesons ) , the standard recipe is to start from the @xmath19 vertices - which are expected to be well understood from experimental evidence , such as from nn scattering at low energies @xcite - and add for the transition vertices the negative parity operator @xmath20 , yielding a well defined scheme for the relative mesonic couplings ( of course , the strength of various vertices on and off shell remains completely open ) . </S>",
    "<S> already at first inspection such a procedure may be ambiguous depending on the explicit order of implementation relative to the dirac matrices in the @xmath19 vertices ( while , for example , the extension of the pseudo - scalar ( ps ) @xmath21 vertex to @xmath22 is unambiguous , however , a sign ambiguity may already arise for the pv vertex from @xmath23 ( the absolute coupling constants are related by the equivalence theorem for the baryons on their mass shell @xcite ) ; similarly on the su(3 ) level mesonic vertices involve d and f components , implying different phases for the @xmath16 vertices @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + in this note we would like to investigate these questions , i. e. the relative phases of the different meson exchanges and the structure of the meson - nn@xmath24 transition form factors in a quark - diquark model for the baryons . in the following chapter </S>",
    "<S> we derive the corresponding formalism ; the main results are then presented and discussed in chapter 3 . finally , in chapter 4 we close with a summary and an outlook for improvements .    </S>",

    "<S> , opposite to the last reference , it seems questionable to fix in a fairly model independent way the vertices @xmath25 , which still involve an overall arbitrary phase for the various resonances ; only the coupling to a given resonance is well defined with respect to the phases in @xmath19 , which are fairly well known . </S>",
    "<S> thus we focus here on a specific resonance , the @xmath27 and investigate the relative phases of selected @xmath16 couplings and the t - channel continuation of the coupling constants ( the same conclusions hold for the @xmath28 resonance ) . as we aim to apply our findings in a next step to meson exchange models at high momentum transfers up to 1 gev / c </S>",
    "<S> , our emphasis is to estimate form factors for the off - shell continuation in a ( at least approximately ) covariant , but still economical way . for this end </S>",
    "<S> , we compromise on our quark representation of the interacting hadrons : we represent baryons as quark - diquark objects @xcite , keeping in this work only the scalar - isoscalar component . for our purpose </S>",
    "<S> such an approximation seems well justified : different investigations show a strong dominance of the scalar component for the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon up to ( and beyond ) momentum transfers of 1 gev / c ; in the same momentum range axial diquarks renormalize magnetic form factors , having , however , no significant influence on their momentum spectrum @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> as the form factors derived show a smooth momentum spectrum ( see the discussion below ) , minor modifications of axial diquarks are readily taken into account in a slight renormalized range parameter for the quark - diquark wave function . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , as a main advantage , lorentz boosts are easily incorporated in a purely scalar diquark picture ( the incorporation of lorentz boosts is still matter of discussion in the literature @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the mesons we still treat as elementary objects , which couple directly to the q - ( qq ) system ( one may include a phenomenological form factor to simulate their finite extension ) . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that our treatment of the meson fields is qualitatively acceptable , as we do not aim at absolute predictions of @xmath16 parameters , but develop simple scaling rules for the n@xmath24 vertices , by exploring their structure relative to the ground - state baryon , i.e. , the nucleon . for the baryons , the quark - diquark representation allows to incorporate approximate covariance beyond non - relativistic potential models , being able to include lorentz - quenching in the radial wave function and the modification of the small component , which enters explicitly into the leading non - relativistic reduction of the vertices . </S>",

    "<S> clearly more sophisticated representations for the @xmath44 as 3q objects found in the literature , they , however , focus either on baryon spectroscopy @xcite or only on a very selective decay channel ( i. e. the @xmath7 channel , @xcite ) . as in addition , extensions to include @xmath45 admixtures in baryons as the leading component in a systematic fock expansion , which clearly are of significant importance for baryons in the continuum , as well as a more detailed and systematic baryon - spectroscopy in a quark - diquark representation are currently missing , we have to defer the investigation of these aspects to future work . + * ii.2 . </S>",

    "<S> we extract both the relative phases between the @xmath16 vertices ( for p - wave dominated @xmath123 resonances ) and the momentum spectra of the hadronic form factors for momenta up to 1 gev / c . for our findings </S>",
    "<S> we feel on a safe ground for the relative phases of the coupling constants , however , the hadronic form factors should be improved in the light of more sophisticated representations for @xmath124 resonances ( we remark , however , that in contrast to the merits of our simple two - body representation of baryons the resolution into 3 quarks immediately raises the well known problems of center - of - mass corrections and lorentz - quenching @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that with continuous and sophisticated data from hadron and electron factories a much more profound understanding of the nature of baryon resonances may be gained in the near future . </S>",
