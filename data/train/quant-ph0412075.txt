    "almost all real - life implementations of schemes for quantum key distribution use qubits as the carriers for the quantum information , and most of them are variants of the very first proposal , the 1984 scheme by bennett and brassard ( bb84 , @xcite ) .",
    "it has an efficiency of @xmath3 under ideal  that is , noise - free",
    " circumstances , which is to say that , on average , one secure key bit can be extracted for two qubits exchanged .    the measurements performed in bb84 do not explore all of the qubit s bloch sphere , but only probe a plane .",
    "the tomography of the qubit state is , therefore , partial rather than complete , which does not matter in ideal , noise - free operation , but it has its drawbacks when the quantum channel is noisy .",
    "by contrast , the `` six - state protocol '' ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) offers full state tomography ; it is the qubit prototype of the higher - dimensional tomographic protocols introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the complete tomography comes at a price ; for each key bit one has to exchange three qubits on average .",
    "full tomography can be had , however , at a much lower cost , as is demonstrated by the protocols with minimal qubit tomography ( mqt ) that we describe here .",
    "they have an ideal efficiency of @xmath0 and thus need only @xmath4 qubits per key bit . put differently , the mqt protocols are potentially 24.5% more efficient than the six - state protocol , their competitor among the standard tomographic protocols .",
    "the key observation is that the tomography of the six - state protocol is redundant , inasmuch as one measures six probabilities to determine the three parameters that specify the qubit state .",
    "by contrast , one measures only four probabilities in mqt to establish the three parameters . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , qubit tomography of this minimal kind is possible indeed .",
    "moreover , a simple one - loop interferometer setup can realize mqt for the polarization qubit of a photon @xcite .",
    "non - interferometric setups are also possible @xcite , and work very well in practice @xcite .",
    "key generation from the raw data is rather straightforward in the six - state protocol where one performs a basis matching as one does for bb84 .",
    "a similar procedure can be applied to the raw data of mqt protocols  the `` renes pairing '' @xcite , discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : renes]but then the achieved efficiency is no more than @xmath1 , the value of the six - state protocol .",
    "thus , if one wishes , as we do , to exploit the advantage offered by mqt , one needs to abandon basis matching and the like in favor of another procedure .",
    "we introduce here one such alternative key generation method that is simple to describe , and to implement , which extracts 0.4 key bits per qubit and thus exceeds the benchmark value of @xmath5 by much and gets quite close to the information - theoretical limit of @xmath6 .    here is a brief outline .",
    "we begin with considering ideal circumstances in sec .",
    "[ sec : ideal ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2ways ] , we then discuss the key generation by two - way communication . the singapore protocol is introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : singprot ] , with emphasis on its tomographic element . in sec .",
    "[ sec : thresh ] , we report the noise thresholds below which the singapore protocol offers secure key distribution .",
    "we close with a summary .",
    "the account given here is a general description of the scheme and a report of all major results of the detailed analysis .",
    "this analysis itself is presented in two companion papers  @xcite .",
    "let us consider ideal circumstances for a start .",
    "we emphasize the symmetry between the communicating parties ",
    "alice and bob  by a scenario in the spirit of ekert s entanglement - based protocol of 1991 @xcite .",
    "a source distributes entangled qubits to alice and bob , one pair at a time .",
    "ideally , the source emits the pairs in the singlet state @xmath7 , whose statistical operator @xmath8 is a symmetric function of the pauli vector operators @xmath9 and @xmath10 for alice s and bob s qubit , respectively .    for each qubit pair ,",
    "one of the four detectors at alice s end will respond , and one of bob s four detectors .",
    "each set of detectors realizes , for the respective qubit , the probability operator measurement ( pom  in the mathematical literature : povm for positive operator valued measure ) that consists of the four half - projectors @xmath11 where the unit vectors @xmath12 have equal angles between them , @xmath13 geometrically speaking , they are the normal vectors for the four faces of a tetrahedron , or one can picture them as pointing from the center of a cube to four nonadjacent corners ; see fig .  1 in ref .",
    "@xcite for an illustration .",
    "their linear dependence and completeness , stated respectively by @xmath14 are basic properties of the tetrahedron vector quartet .",
    "with @xmath15 in we have the members @xmath16 for alice s pom , and likewise @xmath17 gives bob s pom .",
    "the 16 joint probabilities that alice s @xmath18th detector fires together with bob s @xmath19th detector are then given by @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "knowledge of these @xmath22s is tantamount to knowing @xmath23 because the inverse relation @xcite @xmath24 reconstructs @xmath23 from the joint probabilities .",
    "indeed , two - qubit tomography of this kind can be performed and is highly reliable in practice @xcite .",
    "we can think of alice s measurement as preparing bob s qubit at random in the state corresponding to  that is , conditioned on  her unpredictable measurement result . in this sense",
    ", she is sending him a random sequence of qubits through an effective quantum channel .",
    "in fact , if the pair source is located in alice s laboratory , the pair emission in conjunction with her measurement is fully equivalent to a single - qubit source .",
    "conversely , if alice is really operating a single - qubit source with random output , so that the scenario is that of bb84 , we can think of it as an ekert scenario with a corresponding effective two - qubit source .",
    "therefore , our analysis applies to either physical situation .    for the ideal source that emits the singlet states of",
    ", we have @xmath25 that is , two corresponding detectors ( @xmath26 ) never fire together and the other twelve cases are equally probable .",
    "accordingly , the mutual information between alice and bob is @xmath27 where @xmath28 are the marginal probabilities for her and him , respectively ; here simply @xmath29 .",
    "this @xmath30 value exceeds the value of @xmath31 for the six - state protocol @xcite by almost 25% .",
    "the number @xmath32 tells us that alice and bob can generate up to @xmath6 secure key bits for every qubit exchanged through the quantum channel , that is , for every qubit pair they detect .",
    "if they had an appropriate error - correcting code at hand , the key generation could be done by _ one - way _ communication .",
    "unfortunately , however , the best codes that are presently available have an efficiency below the @xmath5 benchmark set by the six - state protocol @xcite .",
    "the standard methods for generating the secret key - bit sequence  for the bb84 scheme , the six - state protocol , and others  all make use of _ two - way _ communication .",
    "such procedures can also be designed for raw data characterized by the joint probabilities in .    for ease of presentation , we assign letters a , b , c , d to the measurement results @xmath21 , so that the raw data make up a four - letter random sequence for alice and another one for bob .",
    "these sequences are such that the two letters for a qubit pair are never the same , and the twelve pairs of different letters are equally frequent .",
    "it is _ as if _",
    "alice were sending a random sequence of the four letters to bob , who never receives the letter sent but gets either one of the other three letters equally likely .",
    "renes s method for key generation @xcite amounts to the following .",
    "suppose alice has letter a , to which she assigns @xmath33 or @xmath34 at random , say @xmath34 to be specific .",
    "then she chooses randomly one of the other three letters , say b , and communicates publicly to bob : `` if your letter is a , call it @xmath33 ; if you have b , call it @xmath34 ! '' , whereby the letter for value @xmath33 is always stated first . bob in turn",
    "reports success if his letter is a or b , failure if he has c or d.    since alice has a @xmath35 chance of guessing bob s letter right when she pairs b with a , the success probability is @xmath35 and the failure probability is @xmath36 . in case of success ,",
    "a pair of potential outcomes is identified with perfect correlations and a key bit is obtained , in full analogy to the pairs of outcomes that are selected by the basis matching of the bb84 protocol or the six - state protocol .",
    "indeed , renes s method is in the tradition of basis - matching procedures inasmuch as his pairing selects a @xmath37 submatrix from the @xmath38 matrix of the joint probabilities of .",
    "there is a crucial difference though : only certain submatrices are useful in the bb84 protocol and the six - state protocol and they are systematically chosen by the basis matching .",
    "but for the mqt probabilities of , the choice is not unique ; you can pair a with b or with c or with d. possibly useful correlations are unavoidably discarded by the renes pairing in the unlucky failure cases and , therefore , this method does not take good advantage of the stronger mqt correlations and does not yield a higher efficiency than the six - state protocol .",
    "one can do much better by other procedures that do not rely on variants of bb84 basis matching and the like .",
    "we describe here one such method , which generates the secret key bits by an iteration and is rather simple to implement .",
    "we recall that the raw data consist of a four - letter random sequence for alice and another one for bob .",
    "each round of the iterative extraction of the key bits then involves the following steps .",
    "* step  1 : *  alice chooses one letter at random , say a. she announces two positions in her sequence where this letter occurs , while not revealing which letter she has chosen .    * step  2a : *  _ if bob has two different letters at these positions _ , say c and d , he forms two groups , one consisting of his letters ( cd ) , one of the others ( ab ) .",
    "he knows for sure that alice s letter is in the second group .",
    "he decides at random to which group he assigns value @xmath33 and to which value @xmath34 .",
    "then he announces the two groups and their values .",
    "alice and bob both enter the value of the group that contains alice s letter as the next bit of the secret key .    * step  2b : *  _ if bob has the same letter twice _",
    ", he announces that this is the case , not telling , of course , which letter he got .",
    "alice records her letter as part of a new sequence for later use .",
    "bob does the same with his letter .",
    "the secondary sequences thus formed have the same statistical properties as the primary sequences .",
    "alice and bob repeat steps 1 and 2 as long as there are enough unused letters .",
    "then they apply the same two - step procedure to the new sequences created in step  2b , thereby getting more key bits and two other new sequences .",
    "next , these sequences are processed , and so forth .",
    "as a result , alice and bob will share an identical sequence of key bits .",
    "nobody else knows the key bits because the public announcements by alice in step  1 and by bob in steps  2a or 2b reveal nothing at all about the values of the key bits .",
    "when a key bit is generated from the original sequences , which happens with probability @xmath39 , two letters are consumed to get it .",
    "for a key bit from the first put - aside sequences , the probability is @xmath40 and four letters are used altogether . for a key bit from the second put - aside sequences",
    ", eight letters are spent with a success probability of @xmath41 ; and so forth .",
    "if the original sequences are @xmath42 letters long , we thus get @xmath43 key bits in total .",
    "the asymptotic efficiency is therefore @xmath44 = \\frac{2}{5 } = 0.4\\,,\\ ] ] which falls short of the theoretical maximum of @xmath6 , but not by much @xcite .",
    "owing to the geometric convergence , just a few rounds are sufficient in practice , the efficiencies being @xmath5 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 for one , two , three rounds , respectively . in short ,",
    "it is easy to get above the @xmath31 efficiency of the six - state protocol .      in any practical implementation of the iterative key generation",
    "one has to settle for a finite number of rounds .",
    "it is then beneficiary to apply the renes pairing in the _ final _ iteration round , i.e. , * step  2b : *  _ if bob has the same letter twice _ , he chooses another letter at random to form a renes pair , which he communicates to alice .",
    "the efficiency is then @xmath47     + \\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^{\\!n\\,}=    \\frac{2}{5}\\left[1-\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^{\\!n+1\\,}\\right]\\ ] ] for a total number of @xmath48 rounds .",
    "thus , this hybrid reaches the @xmath48-iteration yield of after @xmath49 rounds .",
    "the tetrahedron version of renes s `` spherical codes '' @xcite uses the pairing method of sec .",
    "[ sec : renes ] for the key generation from the raw data obtained by mqt .",
    "it does not take advantage of the tomographic power offered by mqt .",
    "in marked contrast , systematic state tomography is a defining element of the _",
    "singapore protocol _ on which we will focus now .",
    "the singapore protocol is specified by ( i ) mqt for the acquisition of raw data ; ( ii ) state tomography for the characterization of the source ; ( iii ) key generation by the iteration method of sec .",
    "[ sec : iteration ] , or by the hybrid method of sec .",
    "[ sec : hybrid ] , or by some other procedure of high efficiency .",
    "the choice of method in ( iii ) distinguishes variants of the singapore protocol , but they all have ( i ) and ( ii ) in common .      the tomographic element in the singapore protocol exploits .",
    "after the detection of many qubits , alice and bob select a random subset of the qubit pairs and reveal to each other , and everybody else , the measurement results obtained for them .",
    "the relative frequencies of the pair events  for which fraction of the pairs did she get , say , a b and he a d ? can serve as simple estimates for the joint probabilities ( @xmath50 for the bd events ) . when used in , they provide an estimate of the two - qubit state emitted by the source .",
    "the more refined methods of quantum state estimation @xcite are likely to give better and more reliable estimates , if the need arises , but in the context of the singapore protocol this is less important .",
    "rather , alice and bob check whether the actual relative frequencies are consistent with the expected output of the qubit - pair source .",
    "they proceed with the key generation only if the source passes the test .",
    "if it fails , the data are rejected as unreliable , and a different source is used .",
    "the `` source '' encompasses here everything that is involved in delivering the qubits to alice and bob : the physical source plus the transmission lines . in the equivalent scenario in which alice produces qubits and sends them to bob",
    ", the tomography establishes the properties of the quantum channel through which the qubits are transmitted .",
    "one can then judge whether the channel is acceptable or not .",
    "one could think that an essential part of the checking is to make sure that the qubit pairs are statistically independent .",
    "this would require a careful look at the joint probabilities for two or more qubit pairs . with a limited number of data sacrificed for the purpose of tomography ,",
    "the confidence level will be high for two pairs , lower for three pairs , even lower for four pairs , and so forth .",
    "but if alice and bob are willing to pay the price , they can reach the confidence level they desire .",
    "in fact , however , such elaborate checks of statistical independence are not necessary because one can rely on the quantum version of the de finetti theorem @xcite .",
    "it ensures that the ensemble of qubit pairs is , for all practical purposes , equivalent to an ensemble of statistically independent pairs if all operations ( consistency check of the relative frequencies of paired qubits iterative key generation ) use randomly selected pairs .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that alice and bob must have criteria according to which they decide whether the source is trustworthy . with a finite number of data at hand",
    ", there can never be absolute certainty about statistical properties . in this respect ,",
    "the tomography of the singapore protocol , and the conclusions about security drawn from it , is on equal footing with the typicality assumptions in the security analysis of schemes for quantum key distribution that follow the paradigm of bb84 .",
    "it is , so to say , a matter of your level of distrust .",
    "when testing a coin that is supposedly unbiased , many would have serious doubts if a million trials gave 70% heads .",
    "but if you are leery , you might mistrust the coin after getting seven heads in ten trials .",
    "an acceptable source would emit independent qubit pairs in the singlet state of with an admixture of unbiased noise  or , equivalently , the noise of an acceptable transmission channel must be unbiased @xcite . accordingly , the statistical properties of the observed detection events must be consistent with the joint probabilities @xmath51 that derive from the two - qubit state of the form @xmath52 where @xmath53 specifies the noise level : no noise for @xmath54 ; nothing but noise for @xmath55 .",
    "the range of interest is @xmath56 because @xmath23 is separable if @xmath57 , and then the correlations exhibited by the @xmath22s are of a classical nature and possess no genuine quantum properties .",
    "the mutual information between alice and bob for the @xmath22s of eq .  ( [ eq : noisy_jointprobs ] ) , @xmath58 decreases monotonically from the @xmath54 value of @xmath6 to @xmath59 for @xmath60 .",
    "it is improbable that the noise in real quantum channels is truly unbiased .",
    "therefore , alice and bob ensure the joint probabilities of eq .",
    "( [ eq : noisy_jointprobs ] ) by twirling : for each pair of detection events the assigning of the letters a , b , c , d to the detectors is done by a random choice of one of the 24 permutations of the letters .",
    "all noise is potentially resulting from eavesdropper eve s attempts at acquiring knowledge about the key bits .",
    "she is given complete control over the source , and the best she can do is to prepare a pure state in which all the qubit pairs sent to alice and bob are entangled with a gigantic ancilla .",
    "upon tracing over the ancilla degrees of freedom , we get the state of many qubit pairs received by alice and bob which  as a result of the full tomography or as an implication of the quantum de finetti theorem  is known to be a product state with one factor for each qubit pair . as a consequence of the schmidt decomposition of the pure entangled state , the reduced ancilla state is unitarily equivalent to this product state , so that eve s ancilla consists of independent qubit pairs , one for each pair sent to alice and bob .",
    "accordingly , eve s optimal strategy @xcite amounts to entangling each qubit pair emitted by the source with a two - qubit ancilla , and to keep all these ancillas as quantum records when the qubit pairs are sent to alice and bob .",
    "eve must ensure that the noisy singlet state results when @xmath61 is traced over the ancilla degrees of freedom , where @xmath62 is the ket for the joint state of a qubit pair sent to alice and bob and the qubit pair of its ancilla .",
    "this requirement determines @xmath62 completely , up to irrelevant unitary transformations on the ancilla ( see @xcite and the appendix in @xcite ) , namely , @xmath63 here , @xmath64 is the singlet for qubits @xmath65 and @xmath18 , whereby qubits @xmath34 and @xmath66 are sent to alice and bob , and qubits @xmath67 and @xmath68 compose the ancilla .",
    "thus , in this most symmetric choice for @xmath62 , the qubit pair of eve s ancilla is on equal footing with the pair sent to alice and bob .",
    "we consider four different eavesdropping attacks . in the first attack ,",
    "eve tries to learn as much as she can about the original letter sequences recorded by alice and bob and does not wait until the public communication between them reveals additional clues .",
    "eve can thus measure her ancillas immediately after the qubits haven been sent to alice and bob , or even before the qubits leave the source , so that this attack could be realized by just emitting a sequence of mixed two - qubit states from the source .",
    "mixed - state attack _ is relevant if eve can not store the ancillas for later processing and alice and bob use a suitable code , such as those discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , to generate the cryptographic key by one - way communication .",
    "if eve can , however , process the ancillas as late",
    "as she wishes , we have the situation discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : message1way ] .    in the second attack , the _ raw - data attack _ on the generated key bits ,",
    "eve takes into account what she learns from the public communication between alice and bob when they execute the steps of secs .",
    "[ sec : iteration ] and [ sec : hybrid ] .",
    "but she continues to rely on the data she gains by the mixed - state attack .",
    "given the limitations of present - day technology , this is the strongest attack alice and bob have to fear in practice .    a much stronger attack , however , is the third attack we consider , the _ collective attack _ on the generated key bits . here , eve performs a collective measurement on all the ancillas to those qubit pairs that contribute to the key bit under attack , exploiting fully the information revealed publicly by alice and bob while they execute steps of secs .",
    "[ sec : iteration ] and [ sec : hybrid ] .",
    "depending on the iteration round in which the key bit is generated , this will involve two , four , eight , ",
    "ancillas , each of them itself a qubit pair .    in order to implement the collective attack",
    ", eve must be able to store the ancillas for a long time , because alice and bob can process their raw data long after it has been acquired , and she must be able to process the ancillas jointly . both tasks are beyond the quantum technology of today and the foreseeable future .",
    "but once the technology exists , such attacks will be a matter of real concern .",
    "therefore , we should also consider the strongest attack conceivable : the _ message attack_. here , eve waits even longer , until after alice and bob have processed the keys generated by the steps of secs .",
    "[ sec : iteration ] and [ sec : hybrid ] by the standard methods of privacy amplification and error correction , and have used the final sequence of key bits to encrypt a message . rather than trying to learn the values of the key bits at any intermediate stage , eve attempts to decrypt the message itself , thereby making optimal use of _ all _ the public information exchanged between alice and bob up to , and including , the encrypted message .",
    "we are content here with giving brief accounts of the results of analyzing these eavesdropping attacks .",
    "the technical details are reported in two companion papers , refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .      for each of alice s detection events ,",
    "there is a conditioned ancilla state of rank  2 .",
    "it is as if alice were sending a random sequence of four different ancilla states to eve , each occurring one - fourth of the time .",
    "eve extracts the information accessible to her by measuring the ancillas with the pom that is optimal for this purpose . for @xmath69 , eve s optimal pom has four possible outcomes and its structure is analogous to the optimal pom for the six - state protocol that is given in ref .  @xcite . for @xmath70 ,",
