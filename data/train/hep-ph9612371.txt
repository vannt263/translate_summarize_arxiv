    "the role of lattice qcd in the field of heavy quark physics is twofold .",
    "first of all it provides experimental and phenomenological physicists with reliable predictions of those non - perturbative qcd parts , which are in nature almost inevitably connected to most of the important electroweak processes .",
    "for example , the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix elements for the weak decay of the @xmath0 quark can not be extracted from experimentally measured b meson decays without distinct knowledge about qcd bound state properties of heavy light systems , i.e. the form factors .",
    "secondly , in the heavy quark regime lattice qcd can successfully describe `` pure qcd '' quantities like quarkonia splittings and the heavy quark potential , which , in turn , can be used to determine the strong running coupling constant @xmath1 .    in order to judge on the quality of results from lattice qcd",
    "it is necessary to understand roughly how the lattice method works in practice , what are its advantages and shortcomings , where systematic uncertainties originate from and how these uncertainties can be controlled .    in principle",
    ", the lattice procedure consists in solving the qcd path integral on a ( euclidean ) space time lattice .",
    "the connection with continuum physics is made in the limit , where ( a ) the lattice constant @xmath2 goes to zero , and ( b ) the lattice volume @xmath3 goes to infinity .",
    "if it were possible to achieve this limit unambiguously , qcd would be solved .    in practice , however , the path integral can be evaluated only for finite values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "this is done numerically with the help of monte carlo methods , which introduce a statistical uncertainty on the results . in order to achieve the continuum limit ,",
    "extrapolations in @xmath2 and @xmath3 are necessary . on top of this ,",
    "most of the lattice calculations in the past have been performed in the so called quenched approximation , where ( roughly speaking ) internal fermion loops are neglected .",
    "progress in lattice qcd therefore has to be measured in terms of    * statistical significance * reliability of the extrapolation @xmath4 , @xmath5 * ability to include internal fermion loops .    especially in the case of heavy - light systems , item ( b ) confronts lattice qcd with a serious problem .",
    "the inverse of the lattice constant @xmath6 can be viewed as a ( gauge invariant ) cutoff to all lattice observables . with todays computer facilities , cutoffs up to @xmath7",
    "can be achieved for suitably large lattice volumes .",
    "if one would try to calculate b - meson properties , with @xmath8 , directly on such a lattice , severe finite cutoff effects would prevent a reliable extrapolation @xmath9 .    an obvious way to alleviate",
    "this problem is of course to extrapolate lattice data in mass from far below the cutoff into the region of heavy masses , e.g. to @xmath10 .",
    "however , as the functional dependence of the lattice data on the heavy quark mass is in general not exactly known , this procedure introduces additional systematic errors , which need to be controlled .    in order to overcome this unsatisfactory situation ,",
    "several methods have been developed and improved over the recent years .",
    "these methods can be classified into three different groups : a priori methods , phenomenological methods , and effective methods .",
    "a priori methods trie to improve on the discretization of the qcd action in such a way , that cutoff effects are reduced .",
    "those `` improved actions '' converge faster to the correct continuum form , leaving the qcd physics unchanged .",
    "the most prominent example in this group is the sheikholeslami - wohlert action@xcite , which is often called clover action .",
    "in contrast to the standard wilson action@xcite , finite cutoff effects proportional to @xmath2 are absent , at least on the classical level .",
    "it turns out , however , that quantum fluctuations can re - introduce @xmath11 cutoff effects .",
    "this problem is currently tackled by a proper adjustment of the coefficient of the ( additional ) clover term .",
    "lattice actions which include this adjustment are traded under the names `` tadpole improved clover action''@xcite or `` non - perturbatively improved clover action''@xcite .",
    "+ in principle it should be possible to formulate a `` perfect '' lattice action , which is free of any cutoff effect .",
    "the construction of such an action is currently under consideration@xcite .",
    "the basic idea of phenomenological methods is , to reduce finite cutoff effects by proper adjustment of lattice observables .",
    "this is achieved by a change in the normalization of the lattice quark propagator ( lmk i)@xcite and by a redefinition of the particle masses ( lmk ii)@xcite . as the modifications are not implemented on a fundamental level , it is not clear whether this method leads to a general improvement of all lattice observables .",
    "effective methods have been designed for heavy quarks on the lattice .",
    "the idea is to remove the largest scale , i.e. the heavy quark mass , from the lattice action .",
    "if all remaining scales are small compared to the lattice cutoff , finite @xmath2 effects should be reduced substantially .",
    "lattice implementations of effective methods have been developed for ( a ) the static approximation@xcite , i.e. the zeroth order of heavy quark effective theory , and ( b ) the non - relativistic qcd@xcite ( nrqcd ) .",
    "the latter approach starts from a non - relativistic approximation of qcd and includes , similar to the well known fouldy - wouthusen transformation , successively relativistic corrections in form of a @xmath12 expansion . clearly",
    ", the range of validity of such methods is limited to the region of ( very ) heavy quarks .    in view of the variety of all these methods ,",
    "whose merits in some cases have not been fully proven yet , one could argue that lattice qcd has lost its status of being an ab initio method . in the following we will try to convince you of the opposite .",
    "the backbone of large scale lattice calculations is always a powerful computer .",
    "the strong increase in sustained computer speed over the recent years allowed for a substantial improvement on statistical significance of lattice data as well as for a variation of the lattice constant and the lattice volume over a much larger range .",
    "with such a tool in hands , one can indeed check on the benefit of the different methods and calculate a reliable estimate of the size of systematic uncertainties .",
    "for example , one can measure the size of finite cutoff effects by performing a series of lattice simulations with different lattice constants @xmath2 .",
    "in that view , the computer can be compared with the accelerator and the detector of a large experiment : the quality of the device has an decisive influence on the quality of the results .    in the following the actual status of the `` lattice experiments '' within the field of heavy quark physics",
    "is reviewed in form of selected examples .",
    "we will discuss the decay constant of the @xmath13 meson , @xmath14 , the semileptonic decays of @xmath13 mesons , and the determination of @xmath1 from quarkonium splittings and the heavy quark potential .",
    "the decay constant of the @xmath13 meson , @xmath14 , is defined in the space time continuum by @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the zeroth component of the axial current and @xmath17 is the @xmath13 meson mass .",
    "thus , @xmath14 can be determined once the matrix element on the left hand side of eq.([za_def ] ) is known .    on the lattice ,",
    "one calculates @xmath18 , which is related to its pendant in the continuum by @xmath19 the renormalization constant @xmath20 accounts for the non - conservation of the axial current .",
    "both , @xmath18 and @xmath20 depend on the lattice spacing @xmath2 , and much work has been devoted to the problem of choosing @xmath20 such that it just cancels the finite cutoff effects of the above product@xcite . as a satisfactory solution to this problem",
    "has not been found yet , an extrapolation @xmath4 is still necessary .",
    "= 12.0 cm    due to limitations in computer time  and computer memory size ",
    "the @xmath13 meson mass is beyond currently attainable lattice cutoffs .",
    "therefore , one calculates @xmath21 with meson masses below the cutoff and in the static limit .",
    "an @xmath22 expansion then interpolates between these results , yielding @xmath14 at a given value of the lattice cutoff .",
    "the quality of such an interpolation is demonstrated in fig.[fig_milc_fb_mps ] .",
    "this procedure has to be repeated for several cutoff values , and finally the continuum extrapolation @xmath4 has to be performed . as the finite volume effects are not crucial for heavy quarks , we will not discuss this point in detail . ] .    as an alternative to this standard procedure",
    ", one can in principle use the nrqcd effective method .",
    "unfortunately , nrqcd is a non - renormalizable theory and one can not send @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , one needs good control over discretization errors of the nrqcd action . in the end",
    "it is necessary to verify , that the results from the standard method and from nrqcd are consistent .",
    "three years ago , the first calculation , which includes the @xmath9 extrapolation , has been performed by the psi - wupp collaboration@xcite . in this simulation , the cutoff and the lattice volume were varied in the ranges @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively . the continuum extrapolation yielded @xmath25mev .",
    "this year , the lattice determination of @xmath14 has been improved by large scale simulations of the jlqcd group@xcite and the milc collaboration@xcite .",
    "preliminary results of a nrqcd calculation of @xmath14 have been published by the sgo collaboration@xcite .",
    "= 14.0 cm    jlqcd has pushed forward in the size of cutoff and volume , namely @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "an important ingredient of their analysis is a careful study of the influence of different choices of @xmath20 on the cutoff dependence of @xmath14 .",
    "the result is displayed in fig.[fig_jlqcd_fb_a ] .",
    "it turns out that , although none of the choices of @xmath20 removes the cutoff dependence completely , the continuum values agree within errors .",
    "the remaining systematic uncertainty due to @xmath20 can be read off the spread of results at @xmath28 .",
    "the final jlqcd results read @xmath29 the first error accounts for statistical , the second for systematic uncertainties .",
    "it is very encouraging to see the psi - wupp result being consolidated by the  more accurate  jlqcd calculation .",
    "= 14.0 cm    the milc collaboration has extended the cutoff even further .",
    "their largest value is @xmath30 .",
    "fig.[fig_milc_fb_a ] shows the final data as well as the extrapolation to @xmath31 .",
    "for the first time in lattice qcd , milc has been able to include full qcd simulations  with @xmath32 dynamical flavors  into the determination of @xmath14 .",
    "the corresponding data is represented by crosses in fig.[fig_milc_fb_a ] . for small @xmath2",
    "the full qcd data seem to enhance the value of @xmath14 . however , the statistical uncertainty is too large to draw a firm conclusion",
    ". instead , milc quotes the quenched result and includes the effect of dynamical fermions as a systematic uncertainty @xmath33 the first error includes statistical errors and systematic effects of changing fitting ranges , the second other systematic errors within the quenched approximation , and the third accounts for quenching effects . within errors ,",
    "the milc result is well compatible with psi - wupp and jlqcd .",
    "the sgo collaboration has analyzed @xmath32 full qcd configurations , using nrqcd for the heavy quark .",
    "they quote a ( preliminary ) value of @xmath34 .    in summary ,",
    "the `` old '' value @xmath35 has been consolidated by more advanced lattice simulations .",
    "however , much work remains to be done in order to reduce statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "a major goal of the next years will be the inclusion of dynamical fermion loops .",
    "semileptonic decay amplitudes can be described as a product of a ( perturbatively accessible ) weak interaction term and perturbatively not accessible qcd part .",
    "the latter is commonly parameterized by a set of form factors@xcite @xmath36 ps , ps and v are momentum dependent pseudo - scalar and vector meson states , and @xmath37 is the ( axial- ) vector current . clearly , the contribution from lattice qcd is a determination of the form factors by a calculation of the left hand side of eq.([ffs_def ] ) .",
    "compared to the calculation of @xmath14 this is not an easy task , as both , the mass dependence and the @xmath38 behavior has to be determined .",
    "due to limited statistical accuracy , it is not yet possible to extract the functional behaviors unambiguously from the data .",
    "thus , systematic uncertainties due to the choice of inter- and extrapolation methods have to be estimated and finally included into the results .",
    "considerable progress with respect to the reliability of inter- and extrapolations has been achieved within the last two years .",
    "`` old '' methods@xcite , simply relied on the validity of the pole dominance hypothesis and on hqet .",
    "as the latter is justified only in the region @xmath40 one had to operate at very large values of @xmath38 .",
    "as current lattice investigations substantially improved on the statistical quality of data , it has become possible to work at more moderate @xmath38 values and to check on the influence of the various assumptions .",
    "the wuppertal group@xcite has performed its analysis at small values of @xmath38 and for meson masses up to @xmath41 . in this region",
    "the form factors can be determined quite reliably . the extrapolation in mass",
    "was done considering various parameterizations for the mass dependence , as shown in fig.[fig_ffs_wuppertal ] .",
    "unfortunately the data is still not precise enough to discriminate between the anstze .",
    "however , the systematic uncertainty due to the extrapolation in mass can be estimated from the variation of results with respect to the various anstze .",
    "an analysis which is more guided by the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) has been performed by the ukqcd@xcite collaboration . in order to extract the maximal information from the data , they work at both , small and large values of @xmath38 , combining the results after extrapolation to @xmath10 .",
    "although this method assumes the validity of hqet at moderate meson masses , e.g. at the @xmath42 meson mass , it leads to quite definite conclusions on the @xmath38 dependence of form factors at the @xmath13 meson mass .    0.1 in    . _",
