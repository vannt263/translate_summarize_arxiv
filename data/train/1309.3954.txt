    "kohn - sham ( ks ) ground - state density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite can be considered the most used method in electronic calculations of quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics .",
    "its practical implementation is based on approximations of the exchange - correlation ( xc ) energy ( @xmath1 ) , which is a subject of intense research @xcite .    the simplest functionals , beyond the local density approximation @xcite ( lda ) , are those based on the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) , which are constructed using the electron density and its gradient .",
    "these functionals can achieve reasonable accuracy at a moderate computational cost @xcite .",
    "however , due to the extreme simplicity of the gga level , no gga functional can be simultaneously highly accurate for atoms and solids @xcite , even if recent ggas can achieve broad applicability , being rather accurate for solids , molecules , surfaces , and interfaces @xcite .",
    "one step further can be achieved by considering meta - generalized - gradient - approximations ( meta - ggas ) @xcite which use the positive ks kinetic energy density @xmath2 ( with @xmath3 being the occupied ks orbitals ) as an additional ingredient to the gga ones .",
    "meta - ggas are the most sophisticated semilocal functionals , incorporating important exact conditions .",
    "they display an improved overall accuracy with respect to the gga functionals @xcite , still having almost the same attractive computational cost .",
    "for these reasons , recently , numerous meta - gga functionals have been proposed @xcite .",
    "nowadays , most semilocal xc functionals are constructed by providing a suitable model for the exchange - correlation energy density .",
    "non - empirical xc functionals base this model on the satisfaction of several exact properties of the xc energy , in order to avoid the use of empirical data and obtain a more robust physical construction .",
    "however , the overall procedure may give rise to some fundamental questions , because the xc energy density is not a well defined physical quantity @xcite and , more importantly , its integral ( i.e. the corresponding xc energy ) is defined up to a gauge @xcite .",
    "therefore , the satisfaction of exact constrains by non - empirical functionals is not a sufficient condition to guarantee the `` exactness '' of the underlying xc energy density model .    for these reasons",
    "it is often useful to consider the alternative definition of the xc energy functional in terms of the xc hole @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the @xmath6-spin density and @xmath7 is the ( coupling - constant averaged ) xc hole ( @xmath8)-spin - density at position @xmath9 around an electron of spin @xmath6 at position @xmath10 .",

    "analysis is obtained as @xcite @xmath20 this is a very powerful tool for understanding in detail the behavior of density functionals at jellium surfaces@xcite , where the small- and large-@xmath19 asymptote are accurately ( exactly ) known .",
    "the modeling of the angle- and system - averaged xc hole is a very important topic in dft because , unlike for the energy density , the angle- and system - averaged xc hole is uniquely defined and is an observable ( at full coupling strength ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , its knowledge can be used via eq .",
    "( [ e_real ] ) to construct non - empirical physically - motivated xc functionals @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the modeling of the angle- and system - averaged xc hole through reverse engineering from an already existing xc approximation can be employed to check the internal consistency of the functional , by comparison with known exact properties of the xc hole .",
    "in fact , any xc functional is better described by its underlying hole , which analyzes the xc energy into contributions of various distances @xmath13 from an electron .    the construction of the xc hole model is well established at the lda @xcite and gga @xcite levels .",
    "however , concerning meta - gga functionals , to our knowledge , only the tpss angle- and system - averaged xc hole model has been back engineered @xcite , proving to be among the most realistic ones currently available in density functional theory .    in this paper",
    "we consider the problem of constructing realistic hole models for sophisticated xc functionals in closer details .",
    "thus , we provide a general model for the angle- and system - averaged xc hole .",
    "the proposed construction can be used for any xc functional satisfying a minimal set of exact constraints of the xc energy .",
    "our model is then applied to construct the angle- and system - averaged xc holes of the non - empirical tpss @xcite , revtpss @xcite , and bloc @xcite meta - gga functionals , which are accurate semilocal functionals respecting many exact constraints of the xc energy , as well as of the widely used empirical m06-l exchange - correlation functional @xcite . finally , the tpss , revtpss , and bloc hole models are applied to perform a real - space analysis of the xc energy of several small atoms and ions , to probe the reliability of the fermi and coulomb holes in each case .",
    "in this section we outline the construction of a general xc hole model for any functional respecting minimal constraints of the exchange and correlation energy .",
    "the procedure for the exchange part closely follows that of ref . and",
    "is briefly repeated here for sake of completeness and to underline better the generality of this construction .",
    "the spin - scaling relation of the exchange energy hole @xcite : @xmath21(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}+\\mathbf{u})= \\sum_{\\sigma}\\frac{n_{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{r})}{n(\\mathbf{r})}\\bar{n}_{x}[2 n_{\\sigma}](\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}+\\mathbf{u } ) , \\label{e7b}\\ ] ] allows to consider only the spin - unpolarized case .",

    "we assume that the functional fulfills the following constraints :    * it recovers lda for a homogeneous electron gas ( i.e. @xmath31 for @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) ; * it can describe accurately one - electron densities .",
    "in addition we ask the functional to be rather accurate for any problem ranging from atoms to jellium models .",

    "this constraint gives the integral equation @xmath53 * * small-@xmath13 behavior*. any accurate dft functional must describe well the local ( nearsighted ) effects @xcite .",

    "the position where the correlation hole equals zero for the first time is defined as the coulomb hole radius @xmath139 .",
    "an alternative definition can be given in terms of the @xmath13-distance where the xc and exchange - only real - space analyses intersect for the first time .",
    "the physical meaning of the coulomb hole radius is to define a sphere of radius @xmath139 around an electron where the probability of finding another electron is reduced by the correlation ( because the correlation hole is negative inside this region ) .",
    "analogously , outside the region enclosed by the coulomb hole radius ( @xmath140 ) the probability to find a second electron is enhanced by the correlation effects @xcite .",
    "the coulomb hole radius is thus a meaningful quantity to be investigated .",
    "however , it has not been given much attention at the dft level .",
    "here we use the semilocal hole models to study this issue .",

    "the results show that all the functionals yield an overestimation for the coulomb hole radius in most of the systems .",
    "this behavior is related to the fact that these functionals describe an insufficient localization for the correlation interaction , tending to represent the correlation interaction as `` smeared out '' in space . as a consequence",
    ", lda fails badly , giving a mean absolute relative error ( mare ) of about 400% , but also the pbe correlation hole model @xcite overestimates @xmath139 by 30% on average .",
    "better results are obtained at meta - gga level . in particular , the bloc correlation , which includes a localization constraint @xcite , can describe the coulomb hole radius with good accuracy .",
    "this latter observation , applied to be and na@xmath137 in particular , suggests that @xmath139 is a quantity mainly governed by the dynamical correlation , so that it can be well described by an accurate semilocal dynamical correlation functional .",
    "thus , static correlation may be supposed to act only on the depth and shape of the correlation hole inside the distance @xmath139 .    to push the investigation",
    "further we computed the value of @xmath139 for the atoms of the periodic table until fr ( @xmath150 ) , using tpss , revtpss , and bloc ( see fig .",
    "[ rc_atoms_fig ] ) .",
    "we use ks exact exchange densities and orbitals . in this case",
    "no exact reference is available , thus the quality of the different results can not be assessed quantitatively .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to draw some interesting qualitative conclusions .",
    "coulomb hole radius computed at the tpss , revtpss , and bloc level for the atoms of the periodic table until @xmath150 . ]    the data of fig .",
    "[ rc_atoms_fig ] show in fact that @xmath139 oscillates strongly for the lighter atoms until @xmath151 ( in agreement with the reference data reported in table [ tab_rc ] ) , while after that the amplitude of the oscillations is dumped .",
    "the first peak in the magnitude of @xmath139 is at he ( @xmath152 ) , the second one is at the o atom ( @xmath153 ) for bloc and revtpss and at the f atom ( @xmath154 ) for tpss ; the third peak is at cl ( @xmath155 ) for bloc and at the sc atom ( @xmath156 ) for both tpss and revtpss .",
    "thus , interestingly for none of the functionals the trend follows exactly the periodicity of the periodic table .",
    "moreover , we see that , although the three functionals display an overall similar trend , important differences can be present for some atoms ( for the o atom the value of @xmath139 differs by more than 1.1 a.u . when computed at the tpss and revtpss level ; a similar difference is found for the @xmath139 of cl computed at the bloc and tpss levels ) .",
    "these features depend on the fact that for some `` critical '' atoms the value of @xmath139 is determined by an inter - shell peak in the correlation hole that is below zero for some functionals and above it for others ( see fig . [ rc_compare_fig ] ) .",
    "real - space analysis of the correlation energy , for na@xmath137 ( top ) and ar ( down ) atoms . ]    without additional benchmark calculations it is not possible to understand whose functional is exhibiting the most correct behavior .    to conclude our short investigation of the coulomb hole radius we consider the problem of how well local and semilocal approximations can perform for atoms with an increasing number of electrons . to this end",
    "we report in fig .",
    "[ nob_rc_fig ] the values of @xmath139 computed at the lda , pbe , and bloc level , for noble atoms with up to 2022 electrons .",
    "the calculations were performed using exact exchange orbitals and densities , similarly with the ones of refs .",
    "@xcite .    coulomb hole radius computed at the lda , pbe , and bloc level for noble gas atoms with @xmath157 . a parabolic extrapolation to @xmath158",
    "is also shown . ]",
    "inspection of the figure shows that lda gives a very diffuse correlation hole for all the atoms ( see also table [ tab_rc ] ) , and only in the limit @xmath158 may become exact @xcite . on the contrary",
    ", pbe yields a visible overestimation with respect to bloc for most atoms in the periodic table , but the two methods agree well for atoms with @xmath159 .",
    "this suggests that in the limit of large atoms the meta - gga and gga levels may be equivalent for the description of the coulomb hole radius .",
    "finally , we note that for heavy atoms @xmath139 is small in @xmath13-space , but not in @xmath89-space .",
    "in fact the lda hole @xcite in the high - density limit has @xmath139 proportional with the thomas - fermi wave vector @xmath160 .",
    "in this paper we have developed a generally - applicable meta - gga xc hole model based on a reverse - engineering method .",
    "it recovers as many exact constraints as a meta - gga hole can and it is very realistic at small and medium electron - electron distances . however , further work can be forseen to improve the large-@xmath13 behavior of the hole model . in fact",
    ", the behavior of a semilocal hole at large electron - electron displacements can be hardly described with accuracy because it is dominated by highly nonlocal xc effects .",
    "this is evident , for example , in the dissociation limit of the hydrogen molecule where the exact xc hole is strongly asymmetrical @xcite in contrast to the semilocal hole which is by construction spherically symmetric .",
    "further difficulties might be encountered by the present semilocal models in the description of low - dimensional problems ( e.g. quasi - two - dimensional regime ) , where additional constraints need to be satisfied @xcite .    despite the limitations mentioned above the hole model developed here",
    "is anyway a powerful tool for dft .",
    "in fact , we have applied it to the tpss , revtpss and bloc meta - gga xc functionals , and we have shown that the resulting meta - gga isotropic coulomb hole is realistic in many situations , giving accurate xc real - space analysis of small atoms and ions as well as xc wave - vector analysis of jellium surfaces .",
    "similar results were also demonstrated for the m06-l xc hole .",
    "moreover , we considered the evaluation of the coulomb hole radius for various atomic systems , showing that this quantity , which was investigated until now only by high - level , wave function methods , being almost out of reach for dft , has a great interest for the detailed understanding of the correlation interaction and the development of better approximations .",
    "also in this case the meta - gga correlation hole models , in particular the bloc one , proved to be efficient tools for the calculation of the coulomb hole radius , yielding errors less than 10% with respect to benchmark data .    finally , we recall that the present hole model can be a good starting point for future developments beyond the semilocal level .",
    "it can be used in fact in the development of higher - level non - local orbital - dependent methods , satisfying exact conditions beyond those available to a meta - gga functional . in this sense ,",
    "screened hybrid functionals @xcite are the most popular example .",
    "however , recently also more advanced models have been proposed such as the screened exchange model of ref . , that reads @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the spin - resolved non - interacting density matrix , and @xmath163 is a screening factor that may be efficiently modeled by considering accurate semilocal exchange and correlation hole models .",
