    "it turns out that @xmath182 can be found analytically in the _ exact _ form . to this goal",

    "the most general expression for @xmath106 that explicitly contains all the powers of @xmath192 up to @xmath197 is as follows @xmath198 where the function @xmath199 and the constant @xmath200 ( of order 1 ) are determined by solution of equation ( [ eq25 ] ) in the required order of @xmath192 .",

    "it is interesting to note that if @xmath96 and @xmath215 , i.e. as in equation ( [ eq20 ] ) , the soliton solution given by equations ( [ eq53])-([eq54 ] ) coincides with the sech - type soliton solution ( [ eq19 ] ) ( in this case @xmath216 and @xmath217 ) .",

    "the cubic term is absent from equation ( [ eq51 ] ) .",

    "[ fg6](b ) indeed cease at the finite values @xmath229 and @xmath230 ( according to equation ( [ eq58 ] ) ) on the boundary @xmath231 of the soliton existence .",

    "[ fg6](a ) , on the contrary , are stable in this limit .",
    "moreover , for @xmath232 , for values of the chemical potential close to the boundary @xmath176 there are soliton solutions which represent the unusual self - bound states of bec , where almost all atoms are gathered in the repulsive @xmath38-condensate .",
    "the unusual solitons have the shape similar to that of soliton-(2 ) of fig .  [ fg4 ] and appear for small values of the parameter @xmath98 .",
    "indeed , their appearance is conditioned by @xmath233 at least , according to formula ( [ eq37 ] ) , while the condition @xmath234 is necessary for a negative lower boundary @xmath208 .",
    "obviously , the stability of such solitons is derived from the strong tunnel - coupling to the attractive @xmath114-condensate and the atoms can be thought as existing in the `` superposition '' of the repulsive and attractive pairs .",
    "we have studied the solitons in bec in a double - well trap with far - separated wells , when the atomic interaction is externally switched from attractive to repulsive in the condensate trapped in one of the wells .",
    "first of all , there are soliton solutions with almost all atoms contained in the attractive condensate , which correspond to weak tunnel - coupling between the condensates in the two wells of the trap . in this case",
    "the attractive condensate serves as a spatially inhomogeneous source of atoms for the repulsive one , thus tailoring the repulsive condensate to the soliton form .",
    "however , there are unusual stable solitons in the system , when almost all atoms are contained in the repulsive condensate .",
    "it is found that such soliton solutions appear for weak repulsion when the zero - point energy of the well with the repulsive condensate is lower than that of the attractive one but is above some critical value depending on the tunneling and interaction coefficients .",
    "the unusual solitons describe the condensates strongly coupled via the quantum tunneling , notwithstanding the fact that the tunneling coefficient is small .",
    "this apparent paradox is resolved by noticing that the tunneling probability is proportional to the number of atoms and that the total number of atoms increases with increase of the relative share of atoms in the repulsive condensate .",
    "the ground state of the system corresponds to the soliton solution with the larger share of atoms contained in the attractive condensate .",
    "however , the solitons with the larger share of atoms in the repulsive condensate are stable , hence they can be experimentally observed .",

    "here we show that the inverse - proportionality relation ( [ eq4 ] ) holds for the eigenfunctions corresponding to the quasi - degenerate energy levels in the double - well trap with weak tunneling through the barrier .",
    "the weakly asymmetric double - well potential can be cast as @xmath235 , where @xmath236 is the symmetric potential and @xmath237 is the perturbation . under assumption ( [ conda1 ] )",
    "the eigenfunctions of the full hamiltonian @xmath238 corresponding to the shifted degenerate energy levels are given by a rotation of the wave functions @xmath239 and @xmath240 corresponding to the degenerate energy levels of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath241 : @xmath242 where @xmath243 and @xmath244 is the energy spitting in the unperturbed and perturbed trap , respectively , and @xmath245 .",
    "the condition for equation ( [ eqa4 ] ) is @xmath246 , where @xmath247 serves as an estimate on the energy gap @xmath248 in the double - well trap",
    ".    equation ( [ eqa4 ] ) guarantees that if the inverse proportionality relation ( [ eq4 ] ) holds for the symmetric double - well it also holds for the asymmetric one .",
    "this follows from a simple calculation : @xmath249 where the supposed inverse proportionality relation ( [ eq4 ] ) for @xmath239 and @xmath240 have been used . on the other hand , under the assumption that the tunneling coefficient is weak the eigenfunctions of the symmetric double",
    "well are well - known combinations of the eigenfunctions for the two far - separated wells : @xmath250 , @xmath251 .",
    "then the relation @xmath252 is obvious due to localization of the wave functions @xmath253 and @xmath254 in the respective wells and the symmetry .",
