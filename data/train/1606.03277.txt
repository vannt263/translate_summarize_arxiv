    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "h@xmath4 is one of the most important species for the thermal evolution in the protostellar collapse , which depends on metallicity and gas density ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . moreover , at densities @xmath5 @xmath6 , dust plays an important role in cooling by radiating away the energy obtained from gas ",
    "grain collisions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "both h@xmath4 formation and dust cooling are governed by the total dust surface area ; therefore , dust grain size distribution is crucial in determining the rates of these processes . @xcite",
    "considered the effects of coagulation on the thermal evolution of star - forming clouds .",
    "although the dense environment enhances the grain  grain sticking ( i.e.  coagulation ) rate , coagulation affects h@xmath4 formation and dust cooling only after these processes are not effective any more .",
    "hence , they concluded that the modification of grain size distribution by coagulation is not important in the thermal evolution of collapsing clouds . according to their results , grains as large as 1 @xmath7 form only at densities @xmath8 @xmath6 in the solar - metallicity case , assuming the brownian grain motion .",
    "some observations have shown the existence of grains larger than @xmath9 in molecular cloud cores and protostellar envelopes .",
    "micrometer ( @xmath7)-sized dust grains are shown to exist in the dense ( @xmath10 @xmath6 ) regions of molecular cores by the scattering - dominated features at wavelengths of a few @xmath7  this scattering phenomena is called coreshine @xcite .",
    "@xcite , based on their coagulation model , concluded that coagulation should last longer than a free - fall time even if they considered enhanced grain motions by turbulence ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this means that the molecular cloud cores are sustained against the self - gravity , creating a favorable condition for grain growth .",
    "grains grow effectively in circumstellar disks at a later stage of star formation @xcite .",
    "the compact emission components near the protostars ( @xmath11a few hundreds of au ) show a small millimeter ( mm ) opacity spectral index ( @xmath12 ) @xcite , while the dust in the interstellar medium ( ism ) has @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the small value of @xmath14 indicates either growth of dust to mm sizes or large optical depth .",
    "protoplanetary disks of class ii young stellar objects show @xmath151 , which may support grain growth to mm sizes in protoplanetary disks @xcite .",
    "some studies have shown that the mm opacity spectral index is small ( @xmath16 ) even in the envelopes of class 0 protostars @xcite .",
    "this implies that mm - sized grains exist not only in the vicinity of protostars but also on larger scales of protostellar envelopes .",
    "however , since class 0 objects are highly embedded , it is difficult to completely separate the optically thick emission , which also decreases the apparent @xmath14 .",
    "recently , @xcite have found a small @xmath17 emission at mm wavelengths in the envelopes of two class i objects , in which we can more easily separate the optically thin envelope component .",
    "their results can be taken as evidence for the existence of mm - sized grains in protostellar envelopes .",
    "@xcite have also analyzed the mm continuum in the orion molecular cloud and found a flat wavelength dependence of dust emission at mm wavelengths , which may also indicate the presence of mm - sized grains . in fig .",
    "4 of @xcite , @xmath16 at @xmath18 1 mm results from a maximum grain size of @xmath19 0.3 mm for compact bare grains .",
    "it indicates that grain growth up to @xmath20 is the minimal requirement to explain the opacity change at mm wavelengths .",
    "some studies show that growth up to 1 mm is necessary to explain the opacity index between @xmath21 and 3 mm @xcite .",
    "if we consider highly porous grains , the grain size should be larger than 1 mm ; @xcite have shown that the absorption opacity of porous grains are the same if the radius times the filling factor are the same . since the conclusion depends on the assumptions on grain properties and radiative transfer effects , we investigate grain growth up to @xmath22 , as a minimum requirement for the phenomenon , and expand our discussions to larger grain radii such as @xmath235 mm .",
    "we refer grains with a size range of @xmath24 to @xmath25 as mm - sized grains in this paper .",
    "the existence of mm - sized grains at the envelope density ( @xmath26 ) enhances the importance of coagulation , more than expected by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , the grain surface area modified by coagulation could affect the grain - surface chemistry and dust cooling in star - forming clouds .",
    "therefore , clarifying the origin of mm - sized grains is of fundamental importance in the understanding of the star formation process . in this paper , we seek to develop a physical scenario that explains the existence of mm - sized grains in the protostellar envelopes .    to this aim",
    ", we first apply our previous coagulation model @xcite to the formation of mm - sized grains in section [ sec : coag ] .",
    "we find that it is unlikely for the grains to grow to mm size in situ in the ( relatively low density ) envelope ; additional physical processes are needed to explain the existence of mm - sized grains in protostellar envelopes . for an additional physical process",
    ", we consider the transportation of mm - sized grains from dense regions to the protostellar envelopes in section [ sec : trans ] .",
    "the survival of such large grains in the envelopes is further examined in section [ sec : survival ] .",
    "finally , section [ sec : summary ] summarizes the scenarios and the main conclusions .",
    "in order to examine the possibility of grain growth in the class  i envelopes , we use the coagulation model in @xcite . we adopt a simple model by @xcite rather than a more comprehensive one in @xcite because it is much faster to compute and more suitable for the large parameter survey needed to determine the minimum density required for grain growth to mm - size . since we use the same models for the grain velocity dispersion as adopted in @xcite",
    ", we expect that we will obtain similar results to theirs . in the model by @xcite ,",
    "the coagulation cross section of a pair of grains with radii @xmath27 and @xmath28 is written as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 represents the increase of the cross section by non - compact aggregates .",
    "the collision rate between the grains is estimated by the radius ( @xmath31)-dependent grain velocities , which are determined by the velocity dispersion of the smallest eddies whose drag force works efficiently within the turn - over time : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the gas temperature , @xmath34 is the hydrogen number density , and @xmath35 is the grain material density .",
    "we assume @xmath33 to be 10 k and @xmath35 to be 3.3 g @xmath6 ( based on silicate ; @xcite ) in this paper .",
    "we assume that the thickness of possible ice coating on the surface is thin and it does not affect @xmath35 .",
    "thermal velocities are small enough to be neglected .",
    "we adopt their `` maximal coagulation model '' ( @xmath36 ; this value is based on @xcite ) , which maximizes the possibility of grain growth , so grains are coated by ice and are sticky as in @xcite .",
    "although some authors have shown that more fluffy aggregates ( i.e. , larger @xmath37 ) than those in @xcite may form in protoplanetary disks @xcite , it is not clear whether such extremely fluffy aggregates form before the disk formation .",
    "in particular , we consider grain collisions with velocities up to @xmath38 ; collisions with such velocities would lead to compaction @xcite . at such a velocity , however , the effect of shattering could become a problem , making the formation of large grains even more difficult @xcite . since the threshold velocities for shattering such as 80 m s@xmath39@xcite are comparable to the typical velocities achieved in our condition , more detailed treatment of grain velocities by considering , for example , grain velocity dispersions would be necessary .",
    "thus , we simply neglect shattering and concentrate on surveying the most optimistic case for the formation of mm - sized grains in this paper .",
    "note that @xmath31 is defined in such a way that @xmath40 is the grain mass , and that the coagulation equations are solved for the grain mass rather than the grain radius in our formulation . since the grain radius @xmath22 appropriate for `` mm - sized grains '' is defined for compact grains ( introduction ) , we eventually need compaction for consistency , or we need much larger grains to change @xmath14 at mm wavelengths if the grains are fluffy .",
    "compaction may occur in the final stage of coagulation when the grain velocities are high @xcite , or in the transportation considered in sections [ sec : trans ] and [ sec : survival ] . since our purpose here is to estimate the most optimistic condition of the density for the formation of mm - sized grains",
    ", we simply assume that such compaction occurs before they are observed in the envelope .",
    "the initial grain - size distribution is set to be proportional to @xmath41 , with @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which is typical in diffuse ism @xcite : @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the normalizing constant determined from the mass density of the grains in the ism : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the hydrogen atom mass , @xmath48 is the atomic weight per hydrogen ( assumed to be 1.4 ) , and @xmath49 ( 0.01 : @xcite ) is the dust - to - gas mass ratio .",
    "the density of the envelope is assumed to be @xmath50 according to @xcite .",
    "we fix @xmath34 and the time is always compared with the local free - fall time ( @xmath51 yr ) .",
    "grains are assumed to be coupled with turbulence whose eddy size is smaller than the jeans length ( so that the assumption of constant @xmath34 is reasonable ) @xcite .    the evolution of grain size distribution by coagulation is shown in fig .  [ fig : coag ] . as shown in fig .",
    "1a , it takes _ much _ more than 10@xmath52 for the grains to grow to @xmath53 even in the maximum coagulation model .",
    "such a long lifetime would require an extremely long - standing sustaining mechanism of molecular clouds against gravitational collapse , and would be physically difficult .",
    "thus , we consider another possibility for the formation of mm - sized grain .     to show the mass distribution per logarithmic grain radius , and is normalized to the hydrogen number density @xmath34 .",
    "the solid , dotted , dashed , dot - dashed and dot - dot - dot - dashed lines show the grain - size distributions at @xmath541 , 3 , 5 , 7 , and 10 , respectively .",
    "the thin solid vertical line indicates the position of @xmath55 . in panels ( a ) and",
    "( b ) , @xmath56 ( the typical density of the envelopes ) and @xmath0 are adopted , respectively.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    it is easier for mm - sized grains to form in a denser region .",
    "we also show the result for @xmath57 in fig .",
    "[ fig : coag]b , trying to see if mm - sized grains can form in the inner , denser regions of the molecular cloud cores .",
    "this time , grains can grow up to @xmath58 in a few @xmath52 , which is reasonably short .",
    "although we neglect shattering , we point out that such a dense region is favorable for growth because grain velocities are @xmath59 m s@xmath60 ( equation [ eq : v_turb ] ) , which is below the shattering threshold @xcite .",
    "thus , we conclude that coagulation is not capable of forming mm - sized grains in the envelope . in order to form such large grains ,",
    "a high density of @xmath61 is necessary .",
    "this means that the existence of mm - sized grains in the protostellar envelopes demands mechanisms other than the in situ formation .",
    "based on that conclusion , we hypothesize that large grains are formed in denser regions near the central object , and are subsequently transported to the envelopes .",
    "we assume that these denser regions hosting coagulation have a spherical geometry for simplicity .",
    "we could in principle also consider other geometries , such as a protoplanetary disk , which should be the site of grain growth leading to the planet formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the basic idea remains qualitatively the same , as long as the formed mm - sized grains are transported relatively early , before the mass of the compact object ( star + disk ) becomes too large , in order to minimize the effect of gravity , which counteracts the outward transportation .",
    "the possibility of transportation is investigated in the next section .",
    "jets and outflows are ejected from the central circumstellar region into the envelope in the class 0 and class i stages ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . in particular , outflows , because of their large opening angles , potentially disperse the large grains in the envelope . to test this possibility",
    ", we consider the motion of mm - sized grains in the outflows .    in section 2 , we concluded that mm - sized grains only form in a region as dense as @xmath61 .",
    "below we consider the motion equation of a grain , whose motion is caused by the friction ( drag ) of the outflow and the gravitational force toward the center . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that the outflow has a constant solid angle of @xmath62 , with a constant velocity @xmath63 .",
    "however , as shown below , the grain motion is determined within the central tens of au , so that the detailed structure of outflow on scales @xmath64 au does not affect our conclusion .",
    "we neglect forces originating from non - spherical motions such as centrifugal force and drag force from a gas rotating around the central star .",
    "the former tends to make the outward transportation of the grains easier , while the latter causes a falling motion toward the central star @xcite . for the treatment of these forces , we need to solve the growths of the disk and the central star .",
    "the physical processes in the growths of these components depend on various factors such as magnetic field strength , and are not fully understood yet @xcite .",
    "thus , we leave a simultaneous treatment of the stellar mass growth processes with grain growth to the future work .    in some numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we see that the mass loss rate @xmath65 is around @xmath66 .",
    "we adopt this value for a fiducial case but examine different values for @xmath67 . with the mass conservation law , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the mass density of molecular gas in the outflow and @xmath70 is the radius from the central protostar",
    ", we get the number density of hydrogen nuclei as a function of @xmath70 as @xmath71    the initial radius @xmath72 is set at @xmath73 ( @xmath74 for @xmath75 , @xmath76 ) and @xmath77 , i.e. , the formation site of the mm - sized grain .",
    "our reference solid angle of @xmath78 corresponds to an outflow opening angle of about 50 degrees , which is roughly in agreement with the observed opening angles of the winds in class 0i sources by @xcite ( @xcite , see their fig .",
    "the drag force on the dust grain is estimated for supersonic motion as @xcite @xmath79 where @xmath31 is the radius of the dust grain and @xmath80 is the relative velocity of the gas to that of the grain .",
    "noting that the grain mass is expressed as @xmath81 , and including the force of gravity by the central object , we obtain the motion equation of the grain ( see also equation 34 in @xcite ) : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the gravitational constant and @xmath84 is the mass inside radius @xmath70 .",
    "first , we consider the condition that the grain obtains an outward motion .",
    "equating the friction term and the gravity term in equation ( [ eq7 ] ) at the initial position ( @xmath85 ) , and further using equation ( [ eq5 ] ) , we obtain the following critical mass , @xmath86 : @xmath87 that is , for @xmath88 , the grain is transported outwards . thus ,",
    "before the mass of the central object ( the central object effectively includes the inner disk as well as the central protostar ) grows up to 0.1@xmath89 , the grains with @xmath901 mm can be `` launched '' into the envelope by the drag force of the gas outflow .",
    "the critical mass does not depend on the radius ; this is because both drag and gravity scale with @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , the condition of grain transportation does not depend on the footpoint of the outflow and is determined by the mass loss rate ( @xmath67 ) , velocity ( @xmath92 ) and opening solid angle ( @xmath62 ) of the outflow .    to investigate the efficiency of grain acceleration",

    "other parameters such as @xmath145 and @xmath141 have minor effects on the total destroyed fraction @xmath170 .",
    "the destroyed fraction @xmath171 ( with @xmath191 ) is rather smaller than @xmath170 because @xmath192 in the parameter ranges of interest . in table",
    "[ tab : phi ] , we show the dependence of @xmath170 and @xmath171 on various parameters to confirm that , unless the grain velocity is @xmath193 , @xmath162 is always significantly smaller than 1",
    ". therefore , mm - sized grains are likely to survive in the envelope .     and @xmath157 . to show the destruction fraction per logarithmic grain radius , we multiply @xmath161 by @xmath31",
    "the solid , dotted and dashed lines show the results for @xmath194 , @xmath195 and @xmath97 respectively .",
    "for example , for @xmath178  mm , @xmath175 peaks at around 200 @xmath7 and the peak value is @xmath1400.1 , which means that the largest contribution to the destruction of the mm - sized grain comes from the field grains with @xmath179 and that around 10 per cent of the mm - sized grain is destroyed by shattering.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    .shattered fractions of the mm - sized grain @xmath170 and @xmath171 with the fiducial parameter set of @xmath196 .",

    "according to a recent observation by @xcite , millimeter ( mm)-sized grains exist in the protostellar envelopes .",
    "we thus investigated the origin of such mm - sized grains using the model by @xcite .",
    "we found that the typical density of the envelopes @xmath197 is not sufficient for the formation of such large grains . only with densities",
    "@xmath61 would such large grains be possible to form .",
    "this means that another mechanism is required to explain the existence of mm - sized grains in the envelopes .",
    "therefore , we further examined the possibility that mm - sized grains formed in denser parts near the central protostar are transported to the envelope by an outflow . first , we found a critical central mass below which the drag force on the dust can win over gravity .",
    "this mass is estimated to be of order 0.1 m@xmath3 for a mass loss rate of @xmath198 .",
    "before the central mass reaches this critical mass , mm - sized grains are transported to the envelope from the dense regions in @xmath199 yr , which is shorter than the mass growth time - scale of the central star .",
    "finally , we examined if the mm - sized grains injected into the envelope are able to survive after shattering in the envelope .",
    "we found that the shattered fraction is @xmath200 , and is robustly smaller than 1 for the reasonable ranges of relevant parameters unless the grain is injected in the envelope with high velocity @xmath201 .",
    "this means that mm - sized grains are likely to survive .",
    "we hence conclude that transportation of mm - sized grains formed in the central dense region to the envelope is a possible scenario for the appearance of mm - sized grains in the protostellar envelope .",
