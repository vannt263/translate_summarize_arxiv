    "the supernova remnant 1e0.4em 0102.2 - 7219  ( hereafter e0102 ) in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) is an interesting example of a young o - rich supernova remnant .",
    "it was first identified as a likely supernova remnant by @xcite based on _ einstein _ soft x - ray images of the smc .",
    "@xcite found a filamentary [ ]  shell ( @xmath2 diameter ) ; the remnant was not visible in h@xmath3   ( [ ] /h@xmath4  @xmath5 ) , and they classified the remnant as o - rich .",
    "they noted diffuse [ ]  and h@xmath3  emission surrounding the [ ]  filaments , with an emission `` hole '' of diameter @xmath6@xmath7 surrounding the [ ] , and suggested that the diameter of the hole could correspond to that of the blast - wave . in a follow - up spectroscopic study @xcite ,",
    "o - rich material was found to have a full width velocity dispersion of @xmath8 .",
    "if the o - rich material is assumed to be undecelerated ejecta , the 6.9 pc diameter of the [ ]  emission ( assuming a distance of 59 kpc ) implies an age of @xmath9 yr .",
    "more recently , the remnant has been studied with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "the remnant has also been observed in the uv @xcite , radio @xcite and numerous times in the x - ray ( hayashi et al .",
    "1994 and references therein ) .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of the remnant has proved difficult to understand ; @xcite were unable to obtain a formally acceptable fit to the _ asca _ data , even with a rather complicated nonequilibrium ionization model , and concluded that the abundances in the plasma are inhomogeneous . by providing high spatial resolution ,",
    "the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ will help us to solve these problems by reducing the spatial confusion that hampered earlier x - ray studies .",
    "we report here on observations of the supernova remnant e0102 obtained during the orbital activation and checkout period for the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ @xcite .",
    "the data were obtained with the s3 chip of the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a backside - illuminated ccd with low to moderate spectral resolution ( @xmath10 at 0.5 kev , @xmath11 at 5.9 kev ) .",
    "we analyzed observation ids ( obsids ) 138 and 1231 ( 1999 aug 23 ; processing version r4c3upd2 ) and obsid 1423 ( 1999 nov 01 ; processing version r4cu4upd1.1 ) .",
    "the 138 and 1231 data were taken with a focal plane temperature of @xmath12 ; the 1423 data were obtained at @xmath13 .",
    "the effective exposure times were 9759 , 9762 and 19104 s ( obsids 138 , 1231 , and 1423 , respectively ) .",
    "we worked from _ chandra x - ray observatory _",
    "center ( cxc ) level 1 and level 2 event lists , and used the _ asca_-like @xmath14 $ ] grade set .",
    "the absolute sky coordinates derived from the fits world coordinate system ( e. w. greisen & m. calabretta 2000 , in preparation ) data in the event list headers yielded slightly different positions for the three data sets ; obsids 138 and 1231 gave consistent results , but obsid 1423 is shifted @xmath15 south - southeast relative to obsid 138 , consistent with a recently discovered secular drift in _ chandra _ coordinate determinations between 1999 august and november .",
    "the 138 and 1231 data were taken within about a day of a boresight calibration observation and should be more accurate .",
    "we registered the three data sets against each other and applied the obsid 138 coordinate transform .",
    "the event data were binned on @xmath16 pixels ( acis pixels ) and smoothed with a @xmath16 fwhm gaussian ( fig .",
    "we computed radial profiles based on @xmath17 sectors and @xmath18 radial binning centered on @xmath19 , @xmath20 ( j2000 ) , the x - ray centroid .",
    "the x - ray emission is dominated by a bright ring with a radius of @xmath21 .",
    "the _ einstein _ and _ rosat",
    "_ hris also detect evidence for a ring of emission , but with at least 5 times poorer spatial resolution , the remarkable substructure and brightness variations were not as evident as with _ chandra_. the ring is inhomogeneous and is brightest and spatially sharpest ( fwhm ) in the southeast , with significant knots south - southwest and west and a ridge northwest ; the peak brightness varies by a factor of about 3 around the ring .",
    "the ring fwhm varies from @xmath22 to @xmath23 with mean @xmath24 ( approximately half the total counts lie within the fwhm ) .",
    "the ring falls off most steeply toward the center , and more gradually outward with suggestions of irregularities or scalloping .",
    "the remnant is bounded by a faint plateau with a relatively sharp outer edge , particularly in the northeast .",
    "this plateau shows a hint of limb brightening in the east and northeast ; the southwest boundary is more diffuse and irregular .",
    "interior to the bright ring the remnant is faint and patchy with suggestions of brighter ridges ; a bright feature extends from near the center toward the bright region south - southwest .",

    "the backside - illuminated s3 chip has good low - energy detection efficiency , but the energy response is nonlinear and temperature - dependent , particularly below @xmath26 ; in view of the uncertainties in the response matrices at this stage of the calibration , we defer a detailed spectral investigation and abundance determination",
    ". nevertheless , the energy scales are sufficiently accurate to allow identification of the major spectral features seen in the earlier _ asca _ data , and for qualitative assessments to be made . in figure  2  , we plot the pulse - height amplitude ( pha ) spectrum for the remnant as a whole ( combined obsids 138 and 1231 ) .    we have examined a number of spectra extracted from various regions in the remnant including the outer shock region , regions of the bright ring , and brighter and fainter regions interior to the bright ring .",
    "the spectra vary throughout the remnant .",
    "the o and ne lines are less prominent in the outer shock region ; the o and ne seem to be in a higher excitation state with much of the emission coming from the h - like stages .",
    "the plasma state ( e.g. , the ratio of the he - like to h - like o [ and ne ] ) also varies around the bright ring .    in order to get a better idea of the variation of plasma conditions within the remnant , we constructed difference maps based on bands centered around the prominent emission lines : @xmath27  @xmath28 kev ( he - like triplet ) , @xmath29  @xmath30 kev ( ly@xmath3 ) , @xmath31  @xmath32 kev ( he - like triplet ) , and @xmath33 ",

    "we plot a difference image of the bands dominated by the  ly @xmath3 line and the  he - like triplet ; in figure  4we show radial profiles for a @xmath17 sector centered @xmath35 south of east ( i.e. , position angle @xmath36 ) .",
    "@xcite ruled out a simple uniform - density shell model for the x - ray emission on the basis of the ( much lower resolution ) _ einstein _ and _ rosat _ hri data .",
    "chandra _ data also suggest that the x - ray morphology is more complex than a uniform shell . in the top panel of figure  4",
    ", we plot the azimuthally averaged x - ray profile and a best fit uniform shell model .",
    "overall , the _ chandra _ data suggest a faint shell of x - ray emission surrounding a bright inhomogeneous ring of emission , possibly thin and ribbon - like . the x - ray remnant as",
    "a whole is remarkably round ( @xmath37% longer northeast to southwest than northwest to southeast ) .",
    "the mean x - ray diameter is @xmath38 . at a distance of 59",

    "@xcite observed the remnant with 3@xmath44 resolution at 6 cm using the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) , and found an outer shell of radio emission with diameter @xmath45 .",

    "( 1981 ) and the x - ray emission ( _ einstein _ hri ) . in figure  5 , we plot radio contours on the _ chandra _ x - ray image . the radio ring maps out the outer x - ray emission well , including the slight northeast to southwest elongation ; the radio ring lies predominantly outside the bright x - ray ring but within the outer x - ray rim .",
    "the radio emission is brightest in the northeast , just inside the brightest portion of the outer x - ray limb .",
    "the radio ring weakens toward the southeast , where the x - ray ring is sharpest and brightest .",
    "however , in the northwest , a bright radio ridge wraps somewhat around the brightest portion of an x - ray ridge and a region of enhanced [ ] emission ( see also  [ sec : comparison.with.optical.data ] ) . in the southwest , a local enhancement of",
    "the radio emission corresponds to a local x - ray enhancement , while the optical data indicate a corresponding gap in the [ ]  and [ ]  emission .",
    "@xcite noted a central enhancement in the 6 cm data and suggested the possibility of a plerionic component ( acknowledging the possibility that it was a mere projection effect ) . at the level of the available _ chandra _ aspect solution ,",
    "the central radio enhancement overlaps a central x - ray bright knot . in the x - ray data ,",
    "this knot coincides with part of a bright ridge extending to the south ( faintly visible in the radio data as well ) , making it likely that the enhancement is a chance superposition .",
    "we obtain an x - ray upper limit on any plerionic contribution as follows : after background subtraction , the number of counts above @xmath46 kev and within @xmath47 of the center of the remnant is @xmath48 counts in a 9762 s exposure , or @xmath49 . using an adopted crab spectrum ( with a power - law of index 2.05 ) , the prelaunch response matrix for the s3 chip , and the assumed distance of 59 kpc , the @xmath1 upper limit is @xmath0 .",
    " _ chandra _ x - ray data with atca 6 cm radio contours .",
    "the x - ray gray scale is the same as in fig .  1",
    ". the radio contours are 0.25 , 0.5 , 0.75 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 2.5 , and 3 mjy beam@xmath50 ; the rms noise is @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "we examined _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) archival [ ]   images of the remnant .",

    "chandra _ x - ray data ( light blue ) .",
    "the southeast portion bright x - ray ring coincides with a series of [ ]   filaments , sharply bounded toward the center of the remnant , with knots and filaments extending outward .",
    "this suggests that we are seeing a tangency of a shock propagating through ejecta .",
    "the [ ]  knots could be engulfed dense ejecta clumps or rayleigh - taylor fingers of ejecta ; the optical emission could be produced by shocks driven into cooler , denser material by the high pressure downstream of the reverse shock , or by photoionization and excitation by the x - rays from the surrounding material @xcite .",
    "note that the [ ]  data were obtained with the planetary camera of the _ hst _ using the f502n filter .",
    "this filter is narrow enough that significant emission may be doppler - shifted out of the filter band pass , particularly for filaments projected toward the interior on the front and back faces of an expanding shell ( blair et al .",
    "the inner edges of the southeast [ ]  filaments may lie inward of the x - ray ring by @xmath53 ( fig .",
    "4 ) ; however , elsewhere in the remnant , bright [ ]  knots coincident with bright x - ray features also tend to be slightly westward of the x - ray emission",
    ". this may also be in part a result of the _ chandra _ absolute coordinate uncertainty .",
    "a number of bright x - ray knots west through south coincide with optically bright features ; most notably , the bright x - ray knot in the south - southwest is likely related to the bright [ ] filament , the brightest [ ]  feature in the remnant .",
    "bright [ ]  filaments border a remarkable gap in the southwest that is suggestive of a blowout .",
    "the x - ray ring is particularly broad at this point , and the radio shows an enhancement as well . as noted above , the outer shock in the southwest quadrant is more ragged and less well defined .",
    "the brightest part of the x - ray ridge in the northwest also coincides with enhanced [ ]  emission .",
    "it is also notable that the 6 cm radio emission shows a ridge in the same location , cupped around the x - ray and optically bright emission ; the morphology suggests a denser clump of ejecta being engulfed by the reverse shock .",
    "there are also puzzling differences between the optical [ ]   and x - ray emission ; for example , an optical filament in the southeast ( between the central spoke and the ring ) is not associated with enhanced x - ray emission .",
    "it is also notable that the x - ray and radio emission look like complete ( if nonuniform ) rings approximately in the plane of the sky , while the optical emission shows , at best , an incomplete ring with large gaps ( _ e.g. _ , north , west , southwest ) ; @xcite modeled the [ ]  emission and velocity distribution as an extremely distorted ring perpendicular to the plane of the sky .    0.8 in",
    "it is plausible to identify the sharp outer edge of the x - ray emission as the location of the direct blast - wave interacting with the ambient medium and the inner edge of the bright ring as the reverse shock .",
    "the scalloping in the region between the bright ring and the rim might then be the result of rayleigh - taylor instabilities of the contact surface .",
    "the outer shock is brightest in the northeast , and at least 5 times fainter in the southwest",
    ". the nonthermal radio emission would be synchrotron emission originating behind the main blast - wave .",
    "the bright radio ridge in the northeast , corresponding to the brightest section of the outer x - ray shock , together with the slight elongation northeast to southwest elongation of the remnant suggests that the ambient medium may be slightly stratified in that direction .    in the x - ray difference maps ( e.g. , fig .",
    "3 ) , the remnant shows a clear layered morphology , in which the inner edge of the bright ring is enhanced in  emission , while the outer part is enhanced in .",
    "the  and   emission shows a similar pattern with  more prominent near the inner edge .",
    "the ne emission is relatively more prominent outward of the peak in the -dominated band .",
    "this pattern suggests that we are seeing the ionization of the gas which has passed through the reverse shock .",
    "the southeast portion of the ring is particularly interesting in this regard , being much brighter and narrower than the rest of the ring ; figure 4   shows radial profiles through this portion of the remnant .",
    "the steep rise at the inner edge and the lag of  relative to  are suggestive of a reverse shock , possibly propagating through a steep density gradient .    in summary ,",
    "the _ chandra _ observations have allowed us to detect the outer blast wave for the first time , and to determine accurately the size of the remnant ; the ring of radio emission is predominantly inward of the x - ray blast wave , which is consistent with an interpretation as synchrotron radiation originating behind the blast wave , but outward of the bright x - ray ring of emission .",
    "complex variations are seen in the bright x - ray ring .",
    "the x - ray spectra vary throughout the remnant .",
    "difference images centered on the prominent h - like and he - like lines of o and ne suggest that the bright ring corresponds to an ionizing reverse shock .",
    "many ( but not all ) of the prominent optical filaments are seen to correspond to x - ray bright regions .",
