    "the two - point correlation function ( hereafter cf ) has been the first and most widely used approach to quantify the degree of clustering in a galaxy sample ( totsuji & kihara 1969 ; peebles 1980 ) .",
    "this statistics has been widely applied to a variety of samples of optically- and infrared - selected galaxies , groups and clusters of galaxies . besides",

    "the correlation length @xmath12 ranges from @xmath17 mpc for optically - selected galaxies ( e. g. , willmer , da costa , & pellegrini 1998 and references cited therein ) to @xmath18 mpc for optically- and x - ray selected galaxy clusters ( e.g. , bahcall & soneira 1983 ; postman , huchra , & geller 1991 ; peacock & west 1992 ; croft et al .",

    "results are far less clear for loose galaxy groups . jing & zhang ( 1988 ) and maia & da costa ( 1989 ) calculated the cf of the groups identified in the cfa1 and ssrs redshift surveys and found that the amplitude of the group cf is lower than that of the galaxy cf . later , from the analysis of the groups identified in a subsample of the cfa2 redshift survey , ramella , geller , & huchra ( 1990 ) found that the amplitudes of the two cfs were similar ( see also kalinkov & kuneva 1990 ) .",

    "we determine the cf ( in redshift space ) of the galaxies and groups in the nearby universe , by using the nog ( `` nearby optical galaxies '' ) sample ( giuricin et al .",
    "2000 ) , which is a complete , distance - limited ( @xmath3 km / s ) and magnitude - limited sample of @xmath27000 nearby and bright optical galaxies , which covers @xmath21 of the sky ( 8.27 sr ) .",
    "this paper is the fourth in a series of papers , in which we investigate on the properties of the large - scale galaxy distribution in the nearby universe by using a nearly all - sky sample of optical galaxies ( marinoni et al .",
    "1998 , paper i ; marinoni et al . 1999 , paper ii ;",
    "giuricin et al .",
    "2000 , paper iii ) . in a forthcoming paper ( marinoni , hudson , & giuricin 2001 ) the optical luminosity function of all galactic systems derived from the nog will be compared to theoretical predictions of the mass function of virialized haloes .",
    "the nog is currently one of the largest samples used in the determination of the galaxy cf , and , compared to other wide - angle , comparatively shallow , bright magnitude - limited galaxy samples , such as the cfa1 , cfa2 , and ssrs2 redshift surveys , the nog may be less sensitive to local density fluctuations because it covers a much larger solid angle .",
    "besides comparing our results with those obtained from other galaxy samples , with our wide sample we examine the dependence of the correlation properties of galaxies on galaxy morphology , attempting a subdivision of galaxies in several morphological subtypes .",
    "we also investigate on the dependence of the galaxy cf on galaxy luminosity . in this respect",
    "our analysis differs from previous relevant studies because we rely on blue total magnitudes fully corrected for internal extinction , galactic extinction , and k - dimming . these corrections lead to brighter magnitudes .",
    "in particular the first correction , which is conspicuous in very inclined spirals , is generally neglected in generic redshift surveys , which comprise many faint galaxies of unknown inclination .",
    "some authors ( e.g. hasegawa & umemura 1993 ) have contended that this correction has a non negligible impact on the determination of luminosity segregation .",
    "furthermore , we investigate on the dependence of the group cf on group properties , relying on two catalogs of groups identified with the hierarchical and percolation _ friends of friends _ algorithms . being extracted from the same galaxy sample , these catalogs allow us to investigate , for the first time , on possible differences in clustering properties strictly related to differences in the algorithm adopted . in the literature",
    "there are as yet no studies dealing with the cf of groups identified with the hierarchical algorithm .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we briefly describe the nog samples of galaxies and groups used in this study . in  3",
    "we deal with the estimate of the redshift - space cf . in ",
    "4 we present the cf of the nog galaxies . in",
    " 5 and  6 we examine the dependence of the galaxy cf on galaxy morphology and luminosity , respectively . in  7 we present the cf of the nog groups and compare it with that of galaxies in order to determine the relative clustering properties . in  8 we explore the dependence of the group cf on group properties ( e.g. , on velocity dispersions , radii , and masses ) .",
    "conclusions are drawn in  9 .",
    "in this work we use the nog sample of galaxies ( described in paper iii ) basically extracted from the lyon - meudon extragalactic database ( leda ; e.g. paturel et al .",
    "1997 ) according to the following selection criteria : i ) galactic latitudes @xmath1 ; ii ) recession velocities ( evaluated in the local group rest frame ) @xmath3 km / s ; iii ) corrected total blue magnitudes @xmath22 mag . in the leda compilation , which collected and homogenized several data for all the galaxies of the main optical catalogs , the original raw data ( blue apparent magnitudes and angular sizes ) have been transformed to the standard systems of the rc3 catalog ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) and have been corrected for galactic extinction , internal extinction , and k - dimming .",
    "the degree of the redshift completeness of the nog is estimated to be 97% . in this work",
    "we consider the sample of 7028 galaxies having @xmath23 km / s .",
    "almost all nog galaxies ( 98.7% ) have a morphological classification .",
    "we divide nog galaxies into two broad morphological bins , early - type galaxies , i.e. e - s0 galaxies ( @xmath24 ) and late - type galaxies ( @xmath25 ) , hereafter denoted as sp , which comprise s0/a galaxies and later types ( t is the morphological type code system of the rc3 catalog ) .",
    "we also attempt a finer morphological subdivision , dividing galaxies into 6 morphological bins , e ( @xmath26 ) , s0 ( @xmath27 ) , s0/a ( @xmath28 ) , sa ( @xmath29 ) , sb ( @xmath30 ) , and later types ( sc@xmath31sd@xmath31sm@xmath31irr , i.e.@xmath32 , hereafter simply denoted as scd ) .",
    "the first subsample , hereafter denoted by e for the sake of simplicity , does not comprise only ellipticals but also lenticulars , since it contains also objects broadly classified as e - s0 .",
    "we also use the catalogs of nog groups identified within the nog by means of the hierarchical ( h ) and the percolation ( p ) algorithms ( see paper iii ) .    in the h method",
    "the authors adopted the galaxy luminosity density as the affinity parameter used to construct the dendrogram and cut the hierarchy at a luminosity density corresponding to a luminosity density contrast of 45 in order to identify groups . in order to take into account the decrease of the magnitude range of the luminosity function sampled at increasing distance ,",
    "the galaxy luminosities were suitably increased with distance .",
    "the authors employed two variants of the p method to identify groups .",
    "in the first variant the authors adopted a velocity link parameter of @xmath33 km / s and a distance link parameter of @xmath34 mpc at the fiducial velocity of 500 km / s ( the latter value corresponds to a number density threshold of 80 ) .",
    "both link parameters were then suitably scaled with distance . in the second variant",
    "the authors scaled with distance only the distance link parameter and kept the velocity link parameter constant at the value of 350 km / s .",
    "given the limited range of redshift encompassed by the nog , this choice was used as an approximation to a slow scaling of @xmath35 with distance , which was suggested by several cosmological n - body simulations ( e.g. , nolthenius & white 1987 ; see paper iii for details on group identifications ) .    excluding the local group , in this paper we consider the 474 groups with at least three members ( of which 61 have at least ten members ) obtained with the h method ( h groups ) and the 506 groups with at least three members ( of which 62 have at least ten members ) obtained with the second variant of the p method ( p groups ) . about 45% of the nog galaxies",
    "are found to be group members .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , in this paper we do not consider groups obtained with the first variant of the p method , because the two variants gave very similar catalogs of groups .",
    "the catalogs of nog groups are among the largest catalogs of groups presently available in the literature .",
    "being extracted from the same galaxy sample , the catalogs of h and p groups allow us also to investigate on differences in the group clustering properties related to differences in the algorithm of group identification .    for the analyses presented in this paper , we construct volume - limited subsamples , which by definition contain objects that are luminous enough to be included in the sample when placed at the cutoff distance .",
    "basically , we define volume - limited subsamples of galaxies with depth of 3000 , 4000 , 5000 , and 6000 km / s .",
    "they contain 1615 , 1895 , 2220 , and 2257 galaxies , respectively .",
    "the absolute magnitude limits corresponding to these distances are @xmath36 - 18.39 , -19.01 , -19.49 , and -19.89 mag , respectively ( here and throughout this paper , in general we omit the 5 @xmath37 term in the absolute magnitude ) .",
    "moreover , we construct volume - limited samples of h and p groups with depth of 4000 km / s , by using suitably modified versions of the h and p algorithms in which the selection parameters which scale with distance are kept fixed at the values corresponding to 4000 km / s .",
    "these volume - limited samples contain 140 h and 141 p groups ( with @xmath38 members ) .",
    "we define the separation in redshift space , @xmath39 , as    @xmath40    where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the velocities of two objects ( galaxies or groups ) separated by an angle @xmath43 on the sky .",
    "we calculate the cf in redshift space , @xmath0 , using the estimator proposed by hamilton ( 1993 )    @xmath44 ^ 2 } -1\\ ] ]    where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 are the number of data  data , random  random , and data  random pairs , respectively , with separation in the interval @xmath48 .",
    "compared to the classical estimator of @xmath0 by davis & peebles ( 1983 ) , which explicitly depends on the mean density assigned to the sample , hamilton s estimator is less affected by the uncertainty in the mean density , which is only a second  order effect . in particular , numerical simulations have shown that hamilton s estimator performs better on large scales where the clustering is weak ( see , e.g. , pons - bordera et al .",
    "1999 and kerscher , szapudi , & szalay 2000 ) for a thorough comparison of the reliability of several estimators of cf ) .",
    "we generate the random sample by filling the sample volume with a random distribution of the same number of points as in the data .",
    "the random points are distributed in depth according to the selection function of the data sample .    in order to minimize the statistical fluctuations in the determination of cf , we average the results obtained using many different replicas of the random sample . in general",
    "we compute 50 replicas in the case of galaxies and 400 in the case of groups .",
    "the counts @xmath45 , @xmath47 , and @xmath46 can be generalized to include a weight @xmath49 , which is particularly important to correct for selection effects at large distances in a magnitude - limited samples . as a matter of fact ,",
    "magnitude - limited samples become sparser at larger distances due to the increasing loss of galaxies caused by the apparent magnitude cutoff .",
    "this effect is quantified by the selection function @xmath50 , which expresses the fraction of objects that are expected to satisfy the sample s selection criteria . for @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is a fiducial distance that we take to be equal to @xmath53 mpc ,",
    "the appropriate selection function for a magnitude - limited sample is simply @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the average completeness level of the sample ( @xmath56 for the nog ) , whereas for @xmath57 the selection function is    @xmath58}^{\\infty } \\phi(l ) dl}{\\int_{l_s}^{\\infty }   \\phi(l ) dl}\\ ] ]    where @xmath59 is the luminosity function , @xmath60 is the minimum luminosity necessary for a galaxy at a distance @xmath39 ( in mpc ) to make it into the sample and the integral is cutoff at the lower limit of @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath60 corresponds to the absolute magnitude @xmath62 , where @xmath63 mag is the limiting apparent magnitude of nog ; thus @xmath64 corresponds to the absolute magnitude @xmath65 mag .    in the calculation of the selection function we use the schechter ( 1976 )",
    "form of the luminosity function that we derive by means of turner s ( 1979 ) method ( see also de lapparent , geller , & huchra 1989 , and paper ii ) , using redshifts as distance indicators , for the whole sample and for specific morphological subsamples .",
    "the adopted schechter parameters are @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( see paper iii ) for the whole nog ( see also paper ii for the values appropriate for the specific morphological types ) .",
    "we have checked that our results on cfs are insensitive to changes of @xmath68 and @xmath69 by 0.2 mag and 0.1 , respectively .",
    "unless otherwise specified , we compute the weighted cf by replacing the counts of pairs with the weighted sum of pairs , @xmath70 , which takes into account the selection effects acting on the sample used .",
    "the weighting scheme we adopt is that of equally weighted volumes , @xmath71 , where @xmath50 is the selection function .",
    "we do not use the minimum variance weighting scheme ( davis & huchra 1982 ) , which requires prior knowledge of the cf .",
    "however , for a dense sample like the nog , the practical improvement provided by using the minimum variance method is very small ( hamilton 1993 ; park et al . 1994 ) .    in several cases we use volume - limited subsamples",
    "this is equivalent to applying a lower limit to the luminosity of the objects of the subsample , leading to an uniformly selected data set with the same weight assigned to each object ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "we calculate the errors for the @xmath0 by using 100 bootstrap resamplings of the data ( e.g. , ling , frenk , & barrow 1986 ) ; bootstrapping tends to overestimate the real errors , as shown by fisher et al .",
    "( 1994 ) .    since in general @xmath0",
    "is satisfactorily described by a power law over a fairly large interval of @xmath39 , we always fit @xmath0 to the form @xmath73 with a non - linear weighted least - squares method in the intervals where @xmath0 is reasonably fitted by a single power - law .",
    "since the points are not statistically independent , it is not strictly correct to use a least - squares method for doing the fit .",
    "but it is a satisfactory approximation ( bouchet et al .",
    "1993 ) especially if we bear in mind that in any case the results of the power - law fits are sensitive to the interval adopted in the fits .",
    "besides , the underestimation of the fit errors due to the bin - bin interdipendence is well compensated by the overestimation given by the bootstrapping - resampling method ( mo , jing , & brner 1992 ) .",
    "the variance of galaxy counts in the volume @xmath74 is related to the moment of @xmath0 which gives the separation  averaged value of @xmath0 in the volume @xmath74 , @xmath75 for a power - law correlation function @xmath15 and a spherical radius of radius @xmath76 ,",
    "this integral can be performed analytically to yield ( cf .",
    "peebles 1980 , section 59.3 )    @xmath77    we use this expression to calculate the _ rms _ fluctuation in galaxy counts within a sphere of 8 @xmath78 mpc radius , @xmath79 , a quantity which is often used to normalize theoretical models .    we evaluate the relative bias between two samples of galaxies of different luminosities or morphological types through the expression    @xmath80    where the starred symbols denote a sample taken as a fiducial .",
    "the redshift - space weighted cf from the whole nog sample , ( 7028 galaxies in the velocity range @xmath81 km / s ) is satisfactorily described by a power law in the interval @xmath82 mpc .",
    "error bars become progressively larger beyond @xmath83 mpc .    from a power - law fit calculated in the interval @xmath7 mpc , which in this case and in most subsamples of galaxies examined in this paper is the one where @xmath0 is best - fitted by a single power law",
    ", we obtain a correlation length of @xmath84mpc and a slope @xmath85 . from these values",
    "we estimate a value of @xmath86 .",
    "more specifically , @xmath0 is not a perfect power - law .",
    "it tends to flatten on small scales ( @xmath87 mpc ) because of the effects of peculiar motions , which smear out galaxy systems along the radial line - of - sight .",
    "it tends to steepen on large scales ( @xmath88 mpc ) .",
    "for instance , we find @xmath89 mpc , @xmath90 in the range @xmath91 mpc , and @xmath92 mpc , @xmath93 in the range @xmath94 mpc .",
    "our values of @xmath12 and @xmath95 turn out to be in good agreement with those relative to the redshift - space @xmath0 derived from the ssrs1 sample ( maurogordato , schaeffer , & da costa 1992 ; @xmath96 mpc , @xmath97 ) , ssrs2 sample ( willmer et al . 1998 ; @xmath98mpc , @xmath99 ) , the sparsely sampled stromlo  apm survey ( loveday et al . 1995 ; @xmath100 mpc , @xmath101 ) , the las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs ; tucker et al . 1997 ; @xmath102mpc ; @xmath103 ) .    besides , the amplitude of the nog @xmath0 is consistent with that of the optical redshift survey ( ors ; hermit et al .",
    "1996 ; @xmath104mpc , @xmath105 for the orsd and orsm samples , respectively ) and that of the cfa2 survey ( de lapparent , geller , & huchra 1988 ) ( @xmath106mpc,@xmath107 ) , which encompasses the great wall , an overdense region characterized by a very high degree of local clustering ( @xmath108 mpc , see ramella , geller , & huchra 1992 ) .    in figure 1",
    "we compare the redshift - space galaxy cf from the whole nog with the redshift - space galaxy cfs from some recent redshift surveys , i.e. the stromlo - apm ( loveday et al . 1995 ) , lcrs ( tucker et al . 1997 ) , durham - ukst ( ratcliffe et al . 1996 ) , and eps ( guzzo et al . 2000 ) redshift surveys .",
    "our results are in good agreement with the results from stromlo - apm and especially with those from lcrs , although the volumes of the last two surveys ( @xmath109 mpc@xmath110 and @xmath111 mpc@xmath110 , respectively ) are quite larger than that of nog ( @xmath112 mpc@xmath110 ) . on small scales ( @xmath113 mpc )",
    ", our results also agree with those from the sparsely - sampled durham - ukst survey ( encompassing a volume of @xmath114 mpc@xmath110 ) , which , however , around @xmath115 mpc , leads to a @xmath0 characterized by a somewhat large amplitude . on the other hand ,",
    "the amplitude of the nog @xmath0 is slightly larger than that of the esp sample ( characterized by @xmath116 mpc , @xmath117 ) , which , owing to its faint magnitude limit , probably contains a much larger population of intrinsically faint , less clustered galaxies .",
    "noticeably , we obtain a smoother @xmath0 than do several previous works probing larger volumes ( see , e.g. the results from the stromlo - apm and durham - ukst surveys plotted in figure 1 ) because nog contains a large number of galaxies .",
    "an important issue to test is the reliability of the weights assigned to each galaxy .",
    "we do that by comparing magnitude - limited subsamples truncated at a given maximum distance @xmath118 to their volume - limited counterparts .",
    "the magnitude- and volume - limited subsamples probe the same volume in space and therefore should lead to the same cf , if the weight in the magnitude - limited subsamples are unbiased , unless there is a strong dependence of clustering on luminosity .",
    "results of this test are presented in figures 2 and 3 .",
    "figure 2 shows the weighted and unweighted cfs of the whole nog sample ( 7028 galaxies ) and the volume - limited sample limited at 6000 km / s ( 2257 galaxies ) .",
    "analogously , figure 3 shows the comparison between the cf of the magnitude - limited ( 4364 galaxies ) and volume - limited ( 1895 galaxies ) subsamples limited at 4000 km / s .    in figures 2 and 3 the cfs of the volume - limited samples satisfactorily",
    "agree with the weighted cfs of the magnitude - limited samples .",
    "this reassures of the validity of the selection function adopted for the nog .",
    "on the other hand , the unweighted cfs have markedly smaller amplitudes .",
    "the differences between the results of the two weighting schemes ( in this case as well as in other cases mentioned below ) stem from the fact that the weighted cf weights each volume of space equally and therefore traces better the clustering of more distant and luminous objects , whereas the unweighted cf is more sensitive to the clustering of nearer and fainter objects . in general , throughout this paper we find that the amplitudes of the weighted cfs are significantly larger than those of their unweighted counterparts and that magnitude - limited and volume - limited subsamples restricted to smaller depths have cfs of smaller amplitudes with respect to subsamples of greater depths .",
    "the cfs of figures 2 and 3 ) .",
    "the latter effects are apparent also in several previous works ( e.g. hermit et al . 1996",
    "; willmer et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "both pronounced tendencies are at least partially due to an increasing clustering with luminosity ( we discuss this issue in  6 ) .",
    "this effect also explains why indeed the volume - limited sample with depth of 6000 km / s tends to lead to a slightly greater cf than the corresponding magnitude - limited sample ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "there are appreciable variations in cfs among small subsamples of nog .",
    "for instance , we have checked that the cf of the subsample ( out to 6000 km / s ) relative to the strip of the sky between the ugc and eso galaxy catalogs ( @xmath119 ) is characterized by an appreciably smaller amplitude and a steeper slope than that of the whole sample , from which the cfs of the regions covered by ugc and eso ( i.e. @xmath120 and @xmath121 , respectively ) do not appreciably depart .",
    "thus , we confirm the results by hermit et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , who , relying on the diameter - limited ors sample , noted the peculiar clustering properties of the above - mentioned strip in the nearby universe .",
    "we analyze the dependence of clustering on galaxy morphology , calculating the cfs for different morphological types .",
    "studies of morphological segregation based on the comparison of two - point correlation functions are complementary to analyses which deal with the relation between galaxy morphology and local galaxy number density , the morphology  density relation .",
    "this relation was defined by dressler ( 1980 ) for galaxy clusters and most of relevant analyses refer to cluster regions , i.e. , to scales smaller than @xmath122 mpc ( see , e.g. , andreon , davoust , & heim 1997 and dressler et al .",
    "1997 for recent accounts of the morphology - density relation ) .",
    "but it was soon suggested that this relation extends outside clusters , i.e. in groups ( e.g. , bhavsar 1981 , de souza et al . 1983 ) and in the field ( postman & geller 1984 ) .",
    "investigations on morphological segregation have also exploited other statistical descriptors of galaxy clustering ( e.g. , lahav & saslaw 1992 ; domnguez - tenreiro et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the weighted cfs for the e - s0 and sp objects of the whole sample and the magnitude - limited sample out to 4000 km / s .",
    "for these magnitude - limited samples and for all volume - limited samples considered , e - s0 galaxies are always more clustered than spirals out to large scales ( @xmath123 mpc ) .",
    "thus we confirm the results of many previous works on the morphological segregation between early- and late - type galaxies ( e.g. , the early works by davis & geller 1976 ; giovanelli , haynes , & chincarini 1986 ; iovino et al .",
    "1993 ) .    remarkably , analyzing the volume - limited sample with depth of 3000 km / s , we find that an appreciable morphological segregation between early- and late - type galaxies is present also at relatively low luminosities ( i.e. , at @xmath124 mag ) , in spite of some recent doubts expressed by beisbart & kerscher ( 2000 ) who claimed that this morphological segregation concerns essentially luminous galaxies .",
    "thus , our results support the contention ( e.g. , the review by ferguson & binggeli 1994 ) that the well - known morphology - density relation inferred for the classical hubble morphological types ( dressler 1980 ) holds also for dwarf galaxies .",
    "we also attempt to use a fine morphological subdivision .",
    "figures 5 and 6 show the weighted cfs for 6 morphological types , e , s0 , s0/a , sa , sb , and scd ( see  2 for details on the adopted morphological subdivision ) for the whole nog sample .    table 1 reports the power - law fit parameters for the various morphological types .",
    "these calculations refer to the interval of separations ( mostly the @xmath125mpc range ) where the cf is in general well approximated by a power law .",
    "if we had attempted to subdivide the e galaxies into two subtypes ( i.e. , @xmath126 and @xmath127 ) we would have found two indistinguishable cfs for the appropriate selection functions .",
    "analogously , if we had subdivided the sa galaxies into two subtypes ( i.e. , @xmath128 and @xmath129 ) we would have obtained two indistinguishable cfs for the appropriate selection functions .    using the whole magnitude - limited sample",
    "is an attempt to extract the maximum signal from the available data , but can have some drawbacks in the presence of luminosity segregation ( see  6 ) , if the type - specific luminosity functions are not similar .",
    "in particular , it is known that scd galaxies are typically less luminous than the other types ( see , e.g. , paper ii ) .",
    "therefore , we have considered also the morphological subsamples extracted from the volume - limited sample at 6000 km / s .",
    "table 2 reports the power - law fit parameters for these subsamples , except for the 101 s0/a galaxies , whose cf is very noisy and can not be reasonably approximated by a power law .",
    "figures 5 and 6 and tables 1 and 2 show that , in general , also morphological subtypes exhibit an appreciable morphological segregation . in general , especially at intermediate scales ( around @xmath9mpc ) there appears to be a gradual decreasing of the strength of clustering from the early - types , specifically from s0 galaxies , to the latest types , the scd galaxies . in several cases",
    "the morphological segregation between the various types persists out to large scales ( @xmath130mpc ) .",
    "as regards the e galaxies , these objects do not exhibit a greater clustering than the s0s .",
    "remarkably , if we had subdivided the e - s0 objects into earlier and later types choosing a different limit in t , i.e. @xmath126 and @xmath131 , we would have found again that the earlier types do not cluster more strongly than the later ones .",
    "the relative differences in the clustering of the various morphological types are confirmed by the analysis of other magnitude - limited samples and volume - limited samples ( e.g. , the samples truncated at 4000 km / s ) . besides",

    "a comparison between table 1 and 2 reveals that , for all morphological subtypes , the cfs derived from volume - limited samples tend to have greater amplitudes than those derived from the corresponding magnitude - limited samples , which is likely to be an effect of luminosity segregation ( see  6 ) . besides , at least partly for the same reason , morphological subsamples limited to smaller depths tend to have cfs of lower amplitudes , as in the general case ( see  4.2 ) .",
    "although the statistical significance of the morphological segregation can be based on the values of the fit parameters ( together with associated errors ) reported in tables 1 and 2 , it is useful to provide a further check on this effect .",

    ", we verify that the luminosity segregation holds separately for early- and late - type luminous ( @xmath158 mag ) galaxies , whereas it is not present in the dim objects of both types . in conclusion , both early- and late - type galaxies show luminosity segregation , which , however , starts to appear only for luminous galaxies ( @xmath170 mag ) .    as in the case of morphological segregation ( see  5 ) , we wish to provide a further test of the luminosity segregation , considering specifically two volume - limited samples at the depth of 6000 km / s , the samples of galaxies having @xmath156 mag and @xmath171 mag . according to the power - law fits reported in table 3 , the difference between the correponding @xmath12-values is significant at the @xmath172 confidence level .",

    "hasegawa & umemura ( 1993 ) claimed that , after correction of luminosities for internal extinction , the early- and late - type galaxies of the cfa1 survey show luminosity segregation of opposite sign ( i.e. segregation and anti - segregation , respectively ) so that this opposite behavior is responsible for a lack of luminosity segregation in the total sample .",
    "beisbart & kerscher ( 2000 ) , who reanalyzed the ssrs2 data in the mathematical framework of marked point processes , found a scale - dependent luminosity segregation attributed mostly to early - type objects .",
    "interestingly , no luminosity segregation was found in the iras 1.2 jy sample ( bouchet et al .",
    "1993 , fisher et al .",
    "1994 ) and in the pscz sample ( szapudi et al . 2000 ) .",
    "a possible explanation for the different behavior of optical and iras galaxy samples with respect to luminosity is that the optical magnitudes are likely to be more strongly related to the mass than far - infrared fluxes .",
    "the dissimilarity between optical and iras samples of galaxies ( and spirals ) can be evidenced by the fact that only 53% of nog galaxies are common to the pscz ; moreover , 30% of the pscz objects contained in the volume encompassed by the nog has no counterparts in the nog .    lets us inspect the sample of very luminous galaxies ( hereafter vlg ) , i.e. the objects with @xmath179 mag ( @xmath180 ) ( see table 3 ) .",
    "the morphological mix of our vlg sample differs from that of the whole nog sample , because the former sample comprises a larger fraction of e - s0 galaxies ( 26% versus 15% ) and a smaller proportion of scd galaxies ( 39% versus 53% ) .",
    "compared to the whole nog sample , there are fewer vlg objects among field ( ungrouped ) galaxies . for instance , for the h groups , the fraction of vlg objects which are field galaxies , members of pairs , members of groups with at least 3 , 10 , and 20 members is 18% , 22% , 60% , 26% , and 15% , respectively ( for the whole nog , the corresponding values are 39% , 17% , 44% , 20% , and 13% ) .",
    "moreover , we count 21 ( 10% ) vlg objects among members of the poor and rich clusters identified within the nog ( i.e. , a194 , a262 , a569 , a3229 , a3565 , a3574 , a3656 , a3742 , centaurus , dorado , eridanus , fornax , hydra , ursa maior , pegasus , virgo ; see table 5 of paper iii ) ; these systems comprise 10% of nog galaxies .",
    "the three richest clusters ( richness class 1 ) in the nog volume ( virgo , hydra , a3565 ) comprise 6 ( 3% ) vlg objects and 5% of nog galaxies . finally , if we count the number of vlg objects and the total number of galaxies belonging to the few systems which have the largest velocity dispersions ( e.g. @xmath181 km / s ) and virial masses ( e.g. , @xmath182 ) , we find again similar percentages ( see  8.1 and  8.3 for the calculation of the two above - mentioned quantities ) .",
    "hence , vlg reside preferentially in galaxy systems ( pairs and groups ) , though not predominantly in rich systems like galaxy clusters .",
    "consistently , they show a value of @xmath12 ( see table 3 ) which is likely to be consistent with that of fairly rich groups , but it is still lower , though not by much , than that of clusters .",
    "we have checked that , if we define the vlg as the objects with @xmath148 brighter than values ranging from -21.1 to -21.5 mag ( @xmath183 ) , we obtain cfs of similar amplitudes .",
    "our results on vlg are in partial agreement with those by cappi et al .",
    "1998 , who , examining the vlg objects ( with @xmath184 - 21 mag , @xmath185 ) extracted from the ssrs2 redshift survey , stated that these objects are not preferentially located in bona fide clusters , but stressed the similarity between their correlation length ( for which they obtained @xmath186 mpc ) and that of apm clusters of low richness ( for which @xmath187 mpc according to dalton et al . 1994 and croft et al . 1997 ) .",
    "in general the redshift distributions of relatively rich p and h groups are shifted to smaller values than that of galaxies .",

    "the nog p groups have smaller sizes than the leda p groups ( the leda h and p groups have a @xmath261-median of 0.62 @xmath78 mpc ; see girardi & giuricin 2000 ) and the new uzc groups by pisani et al .",
    "2001 ( which have a @xmath261-median of @xmath271 mpc ) , probably because we have adopted smaller link parameters .",
    "other catalogs of h and p groups are not easily comparable to the nog groups in this respect , because in general the authors ( e.g. ramella et al .",
    "1997 ) calculate the harmonic radius , which is systematically smaller than the virial radius by a factor of @xmath2 2 ( as discussed by giuricin 1989 ) .    since the redshift distributions of the high-@xmath261 and high-@xmath267 groups",
    "is considerably shifted to greater values than that of the low-@xmath261 and low-@xmath267 groups , we consider only the volume - limited samples of groups in the analysis of the dependence of cf on @xmath261 and @xmath267 .",

    "table 7 reveals that the statistical significance of this effect is at the @xmath275 level . for the volume - limited samples of p and h groups , this effect is respectively slightly larger and smaller than the effect related to @xmath244 .",

    "the virial mass is a reliable indicator of the mass .",
    "reflecting the difference in @xmath244 , the p groups are , on average , more massive than the h groups .",
    "the @xmath276-medians are @xmath278 and @xmath279 for the respective groups with @xmath1893 and increase as we go to richer systems ( e.g. the respective medians are @xmath280 and @xmath281 for the gropus with @xmath189 5 members ) .",
    "the p and h leda groups exhibit an even larger difference in the same sense between the @xmath276-medians ( @xmath282 and @xmath283 , respectively ; see girardi & giuricin 2000 ) , because of differences in the typical sizes of p and h groups discussed in the previous subsection .    as in the case of @xmath261 and @xmath267 , since the redshift distribution is related to @xmath276 , we consider only the volume - limited samples of groups in examining the dependence of cf on @xmath276 .",
    "subdividing the groups according to the @xmath276-medians , we find that the more massive groups tend to be more clustered than the less massive ones , that this effect is more pronounced for the h groups than for the p groups and gets stronger if we raise the limiting values of @xmath276 above their medians .",
    "these results are parallel to those found for @xmath244 and ( especially ) for @xmath261 , as expected from the dependence of @xmath276 on these two quantities .",
    "figures 15 and 16 illustrates the cfs of the high-@xmath276 and low-@xmath284 groups . table 8 , which reports the values of @xmath272 for p and h groups with high and low @xmath276-values ( compared to the value denoted by @xmath285 ) and @xmath189 3 and 4 members , reveals that this effect is in general not stronger than the effect on @xmath244 and on @xmath261 for the volume - limited h and p groups , respectively .",
    "the comparison of the distributions of pairwise group separations of the above - mentioned samples of groups reveals that high-@xmath276 groups have always lower separations , on average , than the corresponding low-@xmath276 groups , with a statistical significance ranging from 95.1% to 99.99% confidence level .",
    "most of galaxy groups are indeed in the phase of collapse and not yet virialized ( e.g. giuricin et al .",
    "1988 , pisani et al .",
    "corrections for non - virialization effects lead to masses which are greater than virial masses by @xmath220 - 60% , depending on the group catalog and on the assumed cosmology ( girardi & giuricin 2000 ) .",
    "however , the corrected masses correlate very well with the ( uncorrected ) virial masses .",
    "therefore , these corrections has no effect on the analysis described in this subsection .",
    "we have calculated the virial crossing time @xmath286 ( expressed in units of ther hubble time @xmath287 ) as @xmath288/[\\sqrt{3 } \\sigma_v]$ ] ( see giuricin et al .",
    "1988 for further details ) .",
    "owing to the difference in the values of @xmath244 and @xmath261 , the h groups have , in general , larger @xmath286-values than the p groups .",
    "the @xmath286-medians are 0.29 and 0.18 for all h and p groups , respectively , with the redshift distribution of the high-@xmath286 p groups being shifted to greater values with respect to that of low-@xmath286 groups .",
    "we have detected no appreciable difference between the @xmath0 of high- and low-@xmath286 h and p groups , for the total and volume - limited samples .",
    "clearly , since @xmath289 , the above - mentioned effects on @xmath261 and @xmath244 cancel out in the ratio .",
    "we have calculated the fraction of early - type ( e+s0 ) galaxies for the nog groups .",
    "the median fraction is 0.2 for the total and volume - limited samples of h and p groups .",
    "as expected from the morphological segregation , this fraction is greater than the fraction of 15% which refers to the whole nog .",
    "groups having a small fraction of early - type galaxies are in general nearer than the norm .",
    "we have detected no appreciable difference between the cfs of the h and p groups with small and large fractions of early - type galaxies for the total and volume - limited samples .",
    "using the two - point correlation function in redshift space , we study the clustering of the galaxies and groups of the nearby optical galaxy ( nog ) sample , which is a complete , distance - limited ( @xmath3 km / s ) and magnitude - limited sample of @xmath27000 nearby and bright optical galaxies , which covers 2/3 of the sky ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "we consider two catalogs of nog groups identified through the hierarchical and percolation algorithms .",
    "\\1 ) the redshift - space two - point correlation function of nog galaxies can be well described by a power - law , with slope @xmath290 and correlation length @xmath291 mpc between 2.7 and @xmath292 mpc , in substantial agreement with the results of most redshift surveys of optical galaxies .",
    "optical surveys , characterized by quite different geometries , volumes , and selection criteria , exhibit similar galaxy correlation functions ( at least between 2 and @xmath8mpc ) , although they show significant discrepancies in the shape and normalization of the resulting galaxy luminosity functions ( as discussed in paper ii ) .",
    "the agreement between galaxy correlation functions derived for a wide range of volumes and sample radii ( as defined in guzzo 1997 ) is in contrast with the fractal interpretation of the galaxy distribution in the universe .",
    "\\2 ) subdividing the nog into early - type ( e - s0 ) and late - type ( spirals and irregular ) galaxies , we note a pronounced morphological segregation , out to 20@xmath78 mpc , between the former objects ( characterized by @xmath293 mpc and @xmath5 ) and the latter ones ( characterized by @xmath294 mpc and @xmath5 ) , in qualitative agreement with many previous investigations .",
    "remarkably , the morphological segregation persists also at relatively low luminosities ( @xmath295 mag ) .",
    "subdividing further the nog into several morphological subtypes , we note a gradual increase of the strength of clustering from the late - type spirals to the s0s , especially on intermediate scales ( around 5@xmath78 mpc ) .    the relative bias factor ( @xmath21.7 in redshift space ) between early- and late - type objects ,",
    "for which there is no good agreement in the literature , appears to be substantially constant with scale .",
    "however , this result is not incompatible with a possible scale dependence in the relation between galaxy number density and mass density ( see , e.g. , blanton et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "\\3 ) analyzing different volume - limited samples , we find that the luminous galaxies turn out to be more clustered than the dim objects .",
    "the luminosity segregation , which is significant for both early- and late - type objects , starts to become appreciable only at relatively high luminosities ( @xmath170 , i.e. @xmath296 ) and is independent on scale ( at least up to 10@xmath78 mpc ) .",
    "the very luminous galaxies ( @xmath297 ; @xmath298 ) reside preferentially in binaries and groups ( though not in clusters ) and their degree of clustering ( @xmath299 mpc ) is compatible with that of rich groups .",
    "both morphological and luminosity segregations are two separate effects ( one effect is not generated by the other ) . the fact that they are present also on large scales favors the interpretation that , on scales greater than @xmath147 mpc , the bulk of these effects is likely to be mostly primordial in origin , i.e. inherent in schemes of biased galaxy formation ( e.g. bardeen et al .",
    "1986 ) and not induced by late environmental effects ( e.g. due to merging , harassment , tidal stripping , accretion , ram pressure ) .",
    "\\4 ) the nog groups identified with the h and p algorithms , though having somewhat different distributions of velocity dispersions , virial masses , and sizes , have similar clustering properties .",
    "the groups show a degree of clustering which is intermediate between those of galaxies and clusters . compared to galaxies",
    ", they exhibit an excess of clustering by a factor @xmath21.5 and @xmath22 , for groups with @xmath188 and @xmath300 members , respectively .",
    "the groups with @xmath188 members are characterized by @xmath301 mpc , which should be regarded as a lower limit since poor groups can be appreciably contaminated by spurious groups .",
    "the groups with @xmath302 members , which have typical ( median ) velocity dispersions of @xmath303 km / s , virial radii of @xmath304 mpc , and virial masses of @xmath305 , are characterized by @xmath306 mpc .",
    "\\5 ) the strength of group clustering depends on the physical properties of groups .",
    "specifically , groups with greater velocity dispersions , sizes ( as traced by virial radii and mean pairwise member separations ) , and virial masses tend to be more clustered than those with lower values of these quantities .",
    "the h groups display a slightly stronger effect than the p groups . on the other hand ,",
    "there is no difference in the degree of clustering between groups with small and large proportion of early - type galaxies .",
    "in comparing the results from different samples through the analysis of correlation functions in redshift space , we have adopted the working hypothesis that , to first order , the influence of redshift space distortions will affect the samples being compared in similar ways .",
    "we are undertaking the analysis of the real - space clustering in the nog .",
    "the results of this work , which is in progress , will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "our results can provide useful constraints to current models of galaxy formation , which are able to fit the two - point galaxy correlation function in a @xmath307cdm cosmology ( e.g. , benson et al .",
    "2000 ) and also attempt to reproduce , with a limited success , the observed morphological and luminosity segregation ( e.g. , kauffmann et al . 1999 ) . as for the clustering of groups , our findings can offer some additional constrains for n - body simulations which in different cosmologies predict the clustering properties of galaxy systems ( see , e.g. , governato et al . 1999 and colberg et al .",
