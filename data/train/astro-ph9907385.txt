    "accretion powers a wide range of energetic objects , systems ranging in size from low - mass x - ray binary systems to the disks surrounding supermassive black holes in active galaxies and quasars .",
    "theoretical models of these systems must be , necessarily , highly simplified .",
    "one such simplification that is often employed is to assume a time stationary disk .",
    "but the rapid time - variability seen in space- and ground - based observations emphasizes that accretion disks are highly dynamic systems .",
    "these observations highlight the need to solve the fully time - dependent equations describing accretion disks , and that , in turn , requires numerical techniques .",
    "recently , time - dependent numerical simulations have been applied to the problem of accretion disk transport .",
    "the discovery of the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) in accretion disks ( balbus & hawley 1991 ) has elucidated the physical basis for this transport : magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence . at the same time , the development of practical three - dimensional mhd codes brought the study of disk mhd turbulence , transport , and evolution into the computational domain .    to date , most of the numerical simulations of the mri have been carried out in a local disk approximation known as the shearing box ( hawley , gammie & balbus 1995 , hereafter hgb ) . in the shearing box model , one considers a frame corotating with the angular velocity at a fiducial radius @xmath2 . by restricting the computational domain to small excursions from this fiducial radius",
    ", one can reduce the geometry ( but not the dynamics ) to a simple cartesian system while retaining tidal and coriolis forces .",
    "local shearing box simulations ( e.g. , hgb ; hawley , gammie , & balbus 1996 , hereafter hgb2 ; brandenburg et al . 1995 ; matsumoto & tajima 1995 ; stone et al .",
    "1996 ) have demonstrated that mhd turbulence is the nonlinear outcome of the mri , and that outward angular momentum transport is its natural consequence .",
    "the total stress @xmath3 is dominated by the maxwell , or magnetic , component rather than the kinematic , or reynolds stress . in disks",
    "the amplitude of this stress is often parameterized with the shakura - sunyaev ( 1973 ) alpha formulation , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the pressure . in the local simulations",
    "typical stress values range from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "these simulations are more fully reviewed in balbus & hawley ( 1998 ) .",
    "an important step in increasing the realism of numerical disk studies is to move from this local approximation to fully global disk simulations .",
    "the difficulties of three dimensional global simulations and , in particular , the demands such simulations place on computer hardware , make this step challenging .",
    "in general , the time- and length - scale differences between the extended radial scales of an accretion disk and the scale of the mhd turbulence are too great to be fully resolved",
    ". nevertheless , global simulations are now possible for somewhat restricted ranges in radius , height , and angle .",
    "several global mhd disk simulations have already been done .",
    "one of the first , by matusmoto & shibata ( 1997 ) , followed the evolution of a thick torus embedded in a weak vertical magnetic field .",
    "what transpires is highly dynamic : the outer layers of the torus slough inward in a process referred to as avalanche accretion .",
    "this avalanche accretion is the global consequence of the radial streaming motion ( the `` channel solution '' ) which is the nonlinear manifestation of the vertical field instability in the local limit ( hawley & balbus 1992 ; goodman & xu 1994 ) .",
    "the vertical field winds up as it is twisted by the torus rotation , and material is accelerated upward and outward along the field lines .    in subsequent work , matsumoto ( 1999 ) evolved constant angular momentum tori containing an initially toroidal field .",
    "the nonaxisymmetric mri rapidly leads to turbulence .",
    "magnetic energy is amplified and approaches a value of @xmath8 . again",
    "the onset and appearance of the nonlinear stage of the instability are understandable in light of what has been seen in local simulations . in this simulation , however , the mri has a global consequence : the resulting mhd stress transports angular momentum outward , rapidly changing the angular momentum distribution from constant with radius to nearly keplerian .",
    "recently , armitage ( 1998 ) performed a global calculation of a cylindrical ( no vertical structure ) keplerian disk using the zeus code ( stone & norman 1992a , b ) .",
    "the initial magnetic field was @xmath9 , with the sine function chosen to vary once over the central part of the disk .",
    "this initial state is unstable , and turbulence rapidly develops along with significant angular momentum transport ; @xmath10 values are on order 0.1 . as in local simulations ,",
    "the maxwell stress is several times the reynolds stress .",
    "the magnetic field in the turbulent disk is dominated by the toroidal component , and the turbulence itself is characterized by structures with small azimuthal wavenumbers @xmath1 .",
    "hawley & balbus ( 1999 ) similarly computed cylindrical models of keplerian disks and constant angular momentum tori .",
    "they found in all cases that the mri rapidly developed leading directly to turbulence and significant angular momentum transport .",
    "global simulations such as these have become possible only recently with advances in available computer speed and memory .",
    "as computer capacities continue to increase , ever more ambitious simulations will become possible .",
    "the aim of this paper is to begin a systematic effort to develop such three - dimensional global mhd disk simulations . to a large extent",
    ", this paper will focus on the technical aspects of such simulations , and the gross dynamics of the mri in global disks .",
    "what type of simulations are currently practical ?",
    "what sort of diagnostics are useful ?",
    "what are the advantages and limitations of simplifications such as axisymmetry or the cylindrical approximation ?",
    "as these questions are addressed , however , several significant conclusions about accretion torus dynamics will be obtained .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows :  2 discusses technical aspects of the global simulations , including the equations , the numerical algorithm , test problems , initial conditions , and diagnostic procedures . in ",
    "3 the results from a range of simulations are presented .",
    "two important simplifications are investigated : two - dimensional axisymmetry , and a cylindrical gravitational potential .",
    "these approximations reduce the computational complexity of global simulations , and a comparison with the full three - dimensional treatment allows their limitations to be assessed .",
    "simulations of fully global three dimensional tori follow . finally ",
    "4 summarizes the conclusions from this work .",
    "the dynamical evolution of an accretion disk is governed by the equations of ideal mhd , i.e. , @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the mass density , @xmath16 is the specific internal energy , @xmath17 is the fluid velocity , @xmath5 is the pressure , @xmath18 is the gravitational potential , and @xmath19 is the magnetic field vector . in the present study",
    "we adopt an adiabatic equation of state , @xmath20 , and ignore radiation transport and losses . since there is no explicit resistivity or physical viscosity , the gas can heat only through adiabatic compression , or in shocks through explicit artificial viscosity , @xmath21 .",
    "artificial viscosity appears as an additional pressure term in equation ( [ ene ] ) , i.e. , @xmath22 ( stone & norman 1992a ) .",
    "the absence of physical shear viscosity in these equations is worth noting .",
    "this is the actual state of the plasma : the molecular viscosity is utterly negligible .",
    "accretion disks evolve due to transport resulting from what is normally referred to as anomalous viscosity .",
    "but this is not an additional term in the equations ; transport results from the dynamics contained within the above equations .    in some simulations below",
    ", the code employs the usual newtonian gravitational potential , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the spherical radius . to deal with the inner boundary in a more realistic manner",
    ", however , the code also makes use of the pseudo - newtonian potential ( paczysky & wiita 1980 ) to model the relativistic effects associated with a schwarzschild metric ( e.g. , minimum stable orbit ) .",
    "this inner boundary permits supersonic ( and super - alfvnic ) accretion off of the inner radial grid , reducing the likelihood of unphysical influences from the boundary conditions .",
    "the pseudo - newtonian potential has the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the `` gravitational radius '' ( akin to the black hole horizon ) , here set equal to 1 . for this potential ,",
    "the keplerian specific angular momentum is @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "here we set @xmath29 , and , for both gravitational potentials , @xmath30 .",
    "this determines the units of time in the simulation with @xmath31 at @xmath32 for a newtonian gravitational potential . all times given",
    "will be reported in these units ; the corresponding orbital periods at locations in the tori will also be given where appropriate .",
    "equations ( [ mass])-([ind ] ) are solved using time - explicit eulerian finite differencing .",
    "the global disk code is written in in cylindrical coordinates , @xmath33 .",
    "the center of the coordinate system is excised , i.e. , the radial coordinate begins at a nonzero minimum @xmath34 ; this avoids the coordinate singularities associated with the axis . in some simulations",
    ", the gravitational potential is assumed to be cylindrical ; this removes the vertical component of gravity , and reduces the number of @xmath35 grid zones required .",
    "when the vertical component of gravity is included , the @xmath35 coordinate is centered on the equatorial plane .",
    "the angle @xmath36 is periodic and covers the full @xmath37 or some integer fraction of @xmath37 . in some simulations ,",
    "only the two - dimensional axisymmetric system @xmath38 will be computed .",
    "a schematic of the computational domain is shown in figure 1 .",
    "most of the three dimensional global simulations are run on parallel computer systems with a version of the global code that uses the message passing interface ( mpi ) library for interprocess communication .",
    "the full computational domain is divided into overlapping subgrids , one for each processor .",
    "boundary zone values are passed between processors using explicit mpi routines . in the description of",
    "what follows , however , this subdivision will be ignored ; the physical domain size and the number of grid zones discussed will be the totals .",
    "the mhd algorithm now has a long history of use .",
    "the magnetic field is evolved with the constrained transport ( ct ) approach of evans and hawley ( 1988 ) that preserves the constraint @xmath39 .",
    "the ct scheme was designed to work in any general curvilinear coordinate system , and here the addition of appropriate geometric terms easily adapts the procedure to cylindrical coordinates .",
    "the algorithm uses information propagated along alfvn characteristics to solve a restricted set of characteristic equations for time - advanced fields and electromotive forces within the ct framework .",
    "this approach is known as the method of characteristics constrained transport ( mocct ) algorithm , and its first implementation is described in detail in stone & norman ( 1992b ) ; the current version is described in hawley & stone ( 1995 ) .",
    "considerable effort has gone into determining the most satisfactory scheme for the individual numerical terms in the present application .",
    "local conservation of angular momentum is particularly important , and a number tests using hydrodynamic keplerian disks on a variety of grids suggest that some numerical approaches are better than others . specifically , it is best to evolve @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the specific angular momentum , as a fundamental variable ( as opposed to angular velocity , or specific angular momentum alone ) and to use consistent advection ( norman , wilson & barton 1980 ) where the advection of all variables is tied to the advection of the density . to minimize errors associated with the coordinate singularity located at @xmath42",
    "we make use of a regularized form of the operator @xmath43 ( evans 1986 ) .",
    "a variety of test simulations were used to verify code performance .",
    "the hydrodynamic implementation was tested with keplerian disks and a series of simulations of constant angular momentum tori similar to those studied by hawley ( 1991 ) .",
    "constant and near - constant angular momentum tori are subject to particularly vigorous growth of the papaloizou - pringle instability ( papaloizou & pringle 1984 ) , especially when such tori are `` slender , '' meaning that their cross section is small compared to the radius of the pressure maximum .",
    "slender tori are unstable to the principal mode of the papaloizou - pringle instability , with growth rates near the maximum value .",
    "these tests gave results that were consistent with past simulations .",
    "for an mhd test , the grid was moved out to large radius and an isolated vertical magnetic field flux tube was embedded in a keplerian flow .",
    "this test is a three - dimensional version of the axisymmetric simulations described in hawley & balbus ( 1991 ) .",
    "again the results were fully consistent with the earlier work .",
    "most of the simulations discussed below consider the problem of the nonlinear evolution of the magnetorotational instability in accretion tori .",
    "tori have significant internal pressure gradients that balance the gravitational and centrifugal accelerations in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "this pressure gives the torus a vertical thickness @xmath44 that can be comparable to its radius @xmath45 .",
    "significant departures from keplerian angular momentum distributions are possible as the torus becomes ever thicker ; the limit is the constant angular momentum torus .",
    "a particularly useful feature of these tori for numerical simulations is that they are well - defined equilibria that can be completely contained on the finite domain of a computational simulation .",
    "this allows their evolution to proceed ( at least initially ) independent of the grid boundary conditions .    for an adiabatic equation of state , a gravitational potential @xmath18 , and an assumed rotation law @xmath46 , the density in the torus",
    "is determined by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the keplerian angular momentum at the pressure maximum and @xmath49 is a constant of integration that establishes the zero pressure surface of the torus .",
    "a given torus is specified by the angular velocity gradient @xmath50 ( with @xmath51 corresponding to constant angular momentum ) , the radial location of the pressure maximum @xmath52 , and the radial location of the inner edge of the torus , @xmath53 ( which determines @xmath49 ) . outside of the torus",
    "the grid is filled with a cold gas with low density .",
    "a floor value of the density and internal energy is applied to ensure that these zones do not become evacuated , or develop extremely high sound speeds .",
    "the floor value of density should be set low enough so that its contribution to the total mass or energy is not significant at any place on the grid . here",
    "the floor value is @xmath54 and the typical torus initial density maximum is @xmath55 .",
    "tori are known to be subject to the purely hydrodynamic global instability discovered by papaloizou & pringle ( 1984 ) .",
    "the papaloizou - pringle instability has been extensively investigated both with perturbation analyses , and with several numerical simulations .",
    "the mechanism of the instability was elucidated by goldreich , goodman & narayan ( 1986 ) and involves the establishment of a global wave that gains energy through the exchange of angular momentum between the inner and outer region of the disk .",
    "amplification requires wave reflection at at least one disk boundary .",
    "the nonlinear evolution of the papaloizou - pringle instability has been followed for both slender ( hawley 1987 ) , and relatively wide ( blaes & hawley 1988 ; hawley 1991 ) tori .",
    "in the slender torus case , the instability saturates as a highly nonaxisymmetric orbiting fluid ellipse ( the `` planet '' solution ; hawley 1987 ) which itself proves to be an equilibrium solution ( goodman , narayan , goldreich 1987 ) .",
    "wider tori saturate in spiral pressure waves ( blaes & hawley 1988 ; hawley 1991 ) .",
    "torus linear stability and , as we shall see , nonlinear dynamics are quite different when a magnetic field is present .",
    "the largest growth rate of the mri greatly exceeds those typical of the hydrodynamic papaloizou - pringle instability .",
    "linear stability analyses bear this out .",
    "curry & pudritz ( 1996 ) and ogilvie & pringle ( 1996 ) have done global linear mhd stability analyses of cylindrical systems ( @xmath56 gravitational potential ) with a variety of initial angular momentum distributions .",
    "they find rapidly growing unstable modes for a wide range of equilibria and field strengths .",
    "although global linear analyses are most appropriate for strong magnetic fields whose most unstable wavelengths are comparable to the size of the torus , weak fields have unstable wavelengths that are much smaller than the torus dimensions .",
    "the essential physics of the mri in these circumstances is local , and the nonlinear evolution should be similar to that seen in the local shearing box simulations .",
    "this is , of course , a testable proposition . in any case",
    ", global simulations will provide information regarding the ultimate consequences of the mri for the evolution , and , indeed , existence of thick tori .",
    "obviously , the initial equilibrium torus can not persist in the face of vigorous instability and the resulting angular momentum transport .",
    "its overall global evolution , however , may present novel features , and the end state of its evolution may represent a more realistic accretion disk structure .",
    "a global simulation will involve a grid with a million to a billion zones , run for possibly hundreds of thousand of timesteps .",
    "a major task is to develop useful diagnostics that concisely and adequately characterize the essential behavior of an evolving disk in such a simulation .",
    "the simplest type of diagnostic is the volume integral of a quantity over the entire grid .",
    "for example , the total mass is @xmath57 time histories are computed of this quantity and others such as total kinetic and magnetic energies ( by component ) , and the radial mass flux @xmath58 through both the inner and outer boundaries .",
    "standard steady - state thin disk models are often expressed in terms of vertically averaged quantities . here",
    "such values can be computed by integrating density - weighted quantities over @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the vertically- and azimuthally - averaged mass density is @xmath59 the averaged mass flux , @xmath60 , is defined by ( [ mdot ] ) , and one can construct similar averages for other quantities . for non - keplerian disks the radial dependence of the average specific angular momentum will be of interest , and this can be computed from @xmath61 the stress @xmath62 consists of a magnetic component ( the maxwell stress ) @xmath63 and a kinematic component ( the reynolds stress ) @xmath64 the value of the perturbed angular velocity @xmath65 is defined for a keplerian disk by @xmath66 . for other angular momentum distributions , including average angular momentum distributions that change with time , we adopt an alternative definition for the perturbed orbital velocity @xmath65 in terms of the difference between the total instantaneous angular momentum flux , and the mass flux times the average angular momentum .",
    "the difference then represents the excess or deficit angular momentum transport due to orbital velocity fluctuations compared to the mean .",
    "specifically , @xmath67    together the maxwell and reynolds stress make up the total stress , which , in the shakura - sunyaev ( 1973 ) parameterization , is set equal to @xmath68 . the stresses observed in the simulations",
    "can be similarly scaled using the vertically averaged pressure to derive an @xmath10 as a function of @xmath45 . in the simulations",
    ", @xmath10 varies with both time and space .",
    "its utility is mainly to provide a familiar point of reference for characterizing the observed stress .",
    "the local shearing box simulations ( hgb ; hgb2 ) found that the maxwell stress , which dominates the total transport , is highly correlated with the total magnetic pressure .",
    "this suggests an alternate stress parameter , the `` magnetic alpha value '' , defined as @xmath69 .    in a steady state disk , the total stress , maxwell plus reynolds ,",
    "would be equal to radial angular momentum flux carried inward by the net radial drift velocity , minus the angular momentum flux at the inner boundary of the disk where the stress is presumed to vanish .",
    "the latter term is generally ignored for radii large compared to the inner disk boundary . in the simulations none of these assumptions",
    "hold _ a priori _ : the typical torus radius is comparable to the inner disk boundary , the stress does not vanish at the inner disk boundary , and the disk will not be in steady state .",
    "in fact , the simulations will prove to be highly dynamic with rapid variations in both time and space .",
    "this is best appreciated from time - dependent animations which also have been used as diagnostics for these global simulations .",
    "while reporting time- and space - averaged quantities tends to obscure this feature , such averages are more practical for a written summary .",
    "in this section the results from a range of three dimensional simulations are presented .",
    "the simulations are listed in the summary table which gives a model designation , the grid resolution used , the gravitational potential , the initial torus angular momentum distribution @xmath50 , the initial magnetic field topology , and the time to which the simulation was run .",
    "the first set of simulations make use of a cylindrical gravitational potential @xmath70 ( the cylindrical disk limit ) .",
    "this is a significant simplification , as it permits the use of periodic boundary conditions in the vertical direction .",
    "further , with this potential there is only one important vertical lengthscale , namely that of the mri ; this reduces the number of @xmath35 grid zones required .",
    "finally , in the cylindrical limit one can study the evolution of models with vertical fields without the stringent courant limits due to the high alfvn speeds associated with strong fields passing through the low density region above the disk .",
    "the first two cylindrical simulations assume a keplerian initial disk .",
    "keplerian simulations provide an immediate comparison with the local shearing box results which also , for the most part , assumed keplerian flow .",
    "consider first the run labeled ck1 in the summary table ; this is a cylindrical computational domain @xmath33 running from 1 to 4 in @xmath45 , 0 to 1 in @xmath35 , and 0 to @xmath71 in @xmath36 .",
    "the grid has @xmath72 zones .",
    "an outflow boundary condition is used at both the outer and inner radial boundaries , and periodic boundary conditions are used for @xmath36 and @xmath35 .",
    "the initial disk has a constant mass density from @xmath73 to the outer boundary .",
    "the adiabatic sound speed is constant and equal to 5% of the orbital velocity at the inner edge of the disk .",
    "the initial magnetic field is vertical and proportional to @xmath74 between @xmath75 and 3.5 , with a maximum strength corresponding to @xmath76 .",
    "the strength of the field , and hence the alfvn speed @xmath77 , was chosen so that the characteristic wavelength of the mri was @xmath78 at the location of the field strength maximum .",
    "this ensures that the @xmath35 domain size and the vertical grid resolution will be adequate to resolve the fastest growing modes .",
    "random nonaxisymmetric pressure fluctuations are added to create a full range of low amplitude initial perturbations .",
    "as the evolution proceeds , the mri sets in , field energy is amplified , and soon the characteristic radial streaming structures ( referred to as the channel solution ) of the vertical field instability appear , much as they do in the local shearing box models . in the present simulation ,",
    "these structures develop first at the inner part of the disk where the rotation frequency is the highest .",
    "the amplitude of the mri becomes nonlinear by 3 orbits at the center of the grid @xmath79 ) , and filaments of strong magnetic field are carried inward and outward by fluid elements well out of keplerian balance .",
    "these reach the outer part of the disk even before the local mri in that region becomes fully nonlinear .",
    "thus there are two immediate global effects not seen in local simulations : linear growth rates that vary strongly with radius ( @xmath80 ) , and extended radial motions of significantly non - keplerian fluid .",
    "in local simulations with initial vertical fields that vary sinusoidally with radius , the initial phase of the instability promptly breaks down into mhd turbulence .",
    "this happens in the global simulation as well .",
    "after the onset of turbulence , the disk displays many tightly wrapped ( i.e. , large radial wavenumber ) trailing spiral features with low azimuthal wavenumber , @xmath1 . the magnetic field energy saturates at about @xmath81 , with the toroidal component dominant : @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "similar ratios were found in the shearing box simulations with zero net initial magnetic field ( hgb2 ) .",
    "the mhd turbulence produces rapid angular momentum transport and mass accretion , with @xmath10 peaking at 0.21 at @xmath84 , and declining beyond this point , dropping to 0.06 at the end of the simulation .",
    "the maxwell stress displays a high correlation with the total magnetic pressure . after an early peak at 0.68 , @xmath85 declines with time ; at the end of the simulation @xmath86 . the ratio maxwell to reynolds stress is about 3 at the time of the largest total stress and rises to about 9 at the end of the simulation .",
    "the overall angular momentum distribution remains nearly keplerian throughout the simulation , becoming slightly sub - keplerian outside of the original inner disk edge , and slightly super - keplerian in the region between this point and the inner grid boundary .",
    "the mass flux , @xmath87 , varies both in space and time .",
    "after 8 orbits of evolution , over half of the initial disk mass has been lost through the boundaries , particularly the outer boundary . since the initial keplerian disk abuts the outer boundary , and the mass increases with radius for a constant initial @xmath15 , it is relatively easy for a considerable amount of the mass to leave the grid , driven in part by a pressure gradient created by a rarefaction wave .",
    "this simulation is similar to that of armitage ( 1998 ) except that it uses a smaller domain in the angular direction , and a constant initial density in the disk .",
    "qualitatively , the two runs exhibit similar behavior , and both are consistent with results from local simulations .",
    "one difference noted by armitage , is that @xmath6 in the global simulation ; this is larger than the value of @xmath88 seen in local simulations with zero net vertical field .",
    "the larger @xmath10 is , however , consistent with what is seen in local simulations with net vertical field .",
    "the global simulations have much larger radial and azimuthal wavelengths available to the mri .",
    "further , the radial scale over which the vertical field sums to zero in the global simulation is much larger than in the local shearing box . here",
    "@xmath89 initially varies between @xmath75 and 3.5 ; this range has a large variation in @xmath90 and hence a large range in growth rates of the mri .",
    "finally , the presence of outflow radial boundaries means the net field need not remain zero over the simulation . in the local simulation ,",
    "periodic boundary ensure that the net field can not change , and by definition , the vertical field sums to zero over a @xmath91 which is small .",
    "reconnection in the local box should be much more efficient , reducing the total magnetic pressure and hence the total stress .",
    "the next simulation , labeled ck2 , begins with the same keplerian disk , but with an initial toroidal field of constant strength , @xmath81 , lying between @xmath92 and 3.5 . generally speaking",
    ", toroidal field simulations are more challenging than vertical field simulations .",
    "although the presence of the linear instability is independent of the orientation of the background magnetic field , the fastest growing toroidal field modes are associated with large vertical and radial wavenumbers .",
    "further , the critical azimuthal wavenumber is large , unless the magnetic energy is comparable to the rotation energy . here @xmath93 .",
    "since there are 80 azimuthal grid zones over @xmath71 in angle , the critical wavenumbers of the instability will be resolved for this choice of field strength .",
    "but it is clear that it takes a relatively strong toroidal field to do so for a reasonable number of grid zones .",
    "this illustrates one of the difficulties with global models : it is necessary to reconcile the practical limitations of grid resolution with the length scales associated with the weakest , and hence most interesting , magnetic fields .    with a toroidal initial field",
    ", the disk evolves at a slower rate that ck1 .",
    "the instability grows over the first few orbits , with the fastest rate of growth associated with the innermost radius .",
    "the growing modes of the instability have the same appearance as seen in the local simulations ; high @xmath1 structures appear first , building to lower @xmath1 with time .",
    "the vertical and radial structure also features high wavenumbers .",
    "the rapid growth phase of the instability ceases after about 8 orbits at the grid center .",
    "at this point the field exhibits a low @xmath1 , tightly wrapped structure , with rapid variations in @xmath45 and @xmath35 .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the linear analysis ( balbus & hawley 1992 ) .",
    "turbulence and accretion begin , and by 12 orbits over half of the disk mass has been lost from the grid ( much of it through the outer boundary ) ; what remains is piled up near @xmath94 and is slowly accreting .",
    "the magnetic field is subthermal and dominated by the toroidal component .",
    "the component magnetic energies at late time are quite similar to those seen in the vertical field run ck1 .",
    "angular momentum transport is again mainly due to the maxwell stress .",
    "compared with ck1 , the toroidal field model has lower overall stress .",
    "this is partly because the vertical field model has a very vigorous initial phase associated with the saturation of the linear instability . at the end of both ck1 and ck2 , @xmath95 .",
    "the mass accretion rate , magnetic field strength , and @xmath10 fluctuate considerably both in time and in space .",
    "the total @xmath10 value rises to 0.12 and then declines to 0.06 by the end of ck2 .",
    "the average ratio of the maxwell to reynolds stress is 6 at late times .",
    "the value of @xmath10 never rises as high as in local vertical field models , including ck1 .",
    "it is comparable , however , to the typical value found for weak field toroidal field models in the local shearing box simulations that began with comparable initial toroidal field strengths ( hgb ) .",
    "these keplerian disk models suffer from significant mass loss through the outer boundary .",
    "in contrast , tori can be completely and self - consistently contained initially within the computational domain .",
    "we next turn to cylindrical models of constant angular momentum ( @xmath51 ) tori , beginning with a torus with @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the torus outer boundary is at @xmath98 .",
    "two simulations are done , model ct1 with an initial vertical field , and ct2 with an initial toroidal magnetic field ; both use the same computational grid as above .",
    "model ct1 begins with a vertical field with constant @xmath99 from @xmath100 to 3.1 .",

    "long before this global instability can develop , the torus is dramatically altered by the local mri .",
    "the torus does not endure as a torus : it expands rapidly outward as the angular momentum distribution shifts from constant toward keplerian .",

    "the overall maxwell stress in the mhd turbulence reaches a peak at @xmath128 , drops off , and then slowly climbs again . at late time @xmath132 , and",

    "reynolds stresses decline with radius , although not as fast as the pressure .",
    "this makes @xmath10 rise sharply .    by the end of the simulation ( @xmath133 ) over one quarter of the disk mass",

    "an examination of the various vertically- and azimuthally - averaged velocities at the end of the run ( fig .",

    "the radial field strength is roughly constant , but the fluid density drops inside of @xmath136 as the flow accelerates inward .",
    "the specific angular momentum drops 3% from @xmath137 to the inner boundary at @xmath75 indicating that there is still some net stress inside @xmath136 .",
    "the cylindrical disk limit represents a useful way of simplifying the full global problem .",
    "another potentially useful simplification is the axisymmetric limit . in this series of simulations , the torus evolution problem is considered in the axisymmetric @xmath38 plane .",
    "these simulations use a pseudo - newtonian potential , and begin with a pressure - supported torus that is fully contained on the grid .",
    "the initial magnetic field is chosen to satisfy two requirements : it must have a poloidal component to allow for the development of the mri , and , as a practical matter , it should be contained completely within the torus to avoid the courant limitations caused by high alfvn speeds due to strong fields in low density regions . a suitable initial configuration consists of magnetic field loops lying along equidensity surfaces in the torus .",
    "this initial setup will develop strong toroidal field due to shearing of the initial radial field .",
    "however , experience has shown that strong toroidal fields are the outcome of all initial field choices , so this should not represent too great an idealization .",
    "all of the two - dimensional simulations considered here will also be run in three dimensions .",
    "the first simulation has a radial grid running from @xmath75 to an outer boundary at @xmath138 and a vertical grid running from @xmath139 to 5 .",
    "the grid resolution is @xmath140 .",
    "a constant-@xmath41 torus is placed on the grid with an inner boundary at the marginally stable orbit , @xmath141 and a pressure maximum at @xmath142 .",
    "the orbital period at the pressure maximum is 50 .",
    "the initial field is obtained from an azimuthal vector potential @xmath143 , and is normalized to @xmath108 using the total integrated magnetic and thermal energies .",
    "density grayscale plots from this simulation are presented in figure 3 .",
    "the initial period of evolution is dominated by the growth of toroidal magnetic field due to shear .",
    "as the magnetic pressure increases , the torus expands , particularly at the inner edge . at first",
    ", low density material is driven outward perpendicular to the torus surface ; subsequently , it flows radially out and around the torus . because of the initial reflection symmetry across the equator , the toroidal field changes sign there and a strong current sheet forms",
    "this current sheet proves to be unstable , and oscillates around the equator .",
    "this is an important part of the evolution , and indicates that it is necessary to simulate the full @xmath38 plane rather than adopt the equator as an explicit boundary .    as the toroidal field pressure increases",
    ", it drives inflow through the marginally stable orbit ; this initial accretion flow peaks at @xmath144 then begins to decline . in the meantime",
    ", the poloidal field mri grows within the torus , and begins to manifest itself visibly in the typical form of radial channels by @xmath145 ( 3.6 orbits ) .",
    "there follows a period of violent readjustment within the disk , featuring strong mass inflow punctuated by episodic accretion events .",
    "this phase lasts until @xmath146 ( 7 orbits ) , beyond which the poloidal magnetic energy declines , and with it the level of turbulence in the disk , and the accretion rate . at the end of the simulation ( @xmath147 , @xmath148 orbits ) about",
    "60% of the initial disk mass has been lost .",
    "most of this mass is lost by @xmath149 ; after this time the inflow accretion rate is very small .",
    "thus there are three distinct phases to the two - dimensional torus evolution : expansion due to the shear - amplified toroidal magnetic pressure , strong nonlinear evolution of the poloidal field mri , and finally a more quiescent turbulent state with declining poloidal magnetic field strengths .",
    "angular momentum transport occurs in all three phases at different rates . in the first phase there is a growing maxwell stress from the amplified @xmath150 field , mainly in the inner region of the disk where the orbital frequency is highest .",
    "the reynolds stress is negligible .",
    "the initially constant angular momentum distribution is unchanged within the disk except in this inner region . with the onset of the mri ,",
    "angular momentum transport occurs everywhere , and the specific angular momentum begins to increase with radius . during the middle of this second phase , angular momentum transport peaks , with @xmath10 ranging between 0.2 and 0.5 through the disk .",
    "as the turbulence subsides , the rate of transport declines with @xmath10 varying between .02 and .1 within the main part of the disk . since this is an axisymmetric simulation , the strength of the poloidal magnetic field",
    "is limited topologically by the antidynamo theorem , and the mhd turbulence must eventually die out .",
    "the next model is a torus located initially at a larger radius , which increases the amount of time that it can evolve prior to reaching the marginally stable orbit .",

    "the orbital period at the pressure maximum is 88 .",
    "again , magnetic field loops are placed along the equidensity surfaces within the torus , with a total magnetic energy corresponding to @xmath99 .    as before , this torus undergoes three phases of evolution : toroidal field amplification , development of the nonlinear poloidal mri , and subsequent turbulence .",
    "the mri saturates around @xmath155 ( 3.4 orbits ) with total magnetic energy @xmath156 .",
    "the phase of strong mri turbulence is over by @xmath157 ( 5.1 orbits ) when the average @xmath116 rises to 6 ; fairly steady accretion follows for the remainder of the simulation which runs to time @xmath158 ( 9.5 orbits ) .    in the third simulation",
    ", the initial torus has an angular momentum distribution closer to keplerian , specifically @xmath159 .",
    "the torus inner boundary is at 4 and its pressure maximum at @xmath160 ( orbital period @xmath161 ) .",
    "the computational domain runs from @xmath162 to 21.5 , and from @xmath163 to 10 in @xmath35 ; the grid resolution is @xmath140 .",
    "although it began with a much different initial angular momentum distribution , the evolution is quite similar to the two previous cases . in the early stage , toroidal field",
    "is amplified by shear .",
    "the poloidal mri soon comes into play , producing the characteristic radial streams .",
    "the total magnetic energy peaks at about @xmath164 ( 4.5 orbits ) .",
    "after this the poloidal field energy declines steadily , as does the maxwell stress and the mass accretion through the inner radial boundary .",
    "toroidal field dominates , with the ratio @xmath165 . beyond @xmath166 ,",
    "the toroidal field energy is essentially constant with a @xmath167 .",
    "angular momentum transport begins almost immediately .",
    "initially it is confined to the inner regions of the torus where shear is strongest , and dominated by the maxwell stress associated with the growing toroidal field",
    ". however , the growth of the mri produces stress throughout the torus .",
    "by @xmath168 the averaged @xmath10 value is between 0.1 and 0.2 . at the end of the simulation at @xmath169 , @xmath10 ranges between 0.01 and 0.04 within the torus .",
    "the ratio of the maxwell stress to the magnetic pressure , @xmath85 , begins small , rises to a value of 0.1 during the initial saturation of the mri , then steadily declines to 0.03 by the end of the simulation as poloidal field is preferentially destroyed .",
    "since this torus began with an angular momentum distribution similar to the end state of the initially @xmath51 tori , there is only a slight change in the slope of the average angular momentum .",
    "once the torus expands , this slope is extended in range all the way from @xmath170 to the outer radial boundary .",
    "now we turn to the evolution of fully three dimensional tori using a pseudo - newtonian potential .",
    "the simulations described in this section are three - dimensional versions of the tori considered above in the axisymmetric limit .",
    "the first , model gt1 , is the constant angular momentum torus with @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "the orbital period at the pressure maximum is @xmath173 .",
    "the computational domain runs from 1.5 to 11.5 in radius , from @xmath174 to @xmath175 in @xmath35 , and from @xmath176 to @xmath71 .",
    "the initial magnetic field is constructed by setting the toroidal component of the vector potential equal to the density inside the disk , @xmath177 , for all @xmath15 greater than a minimum value .",
    "the total magnetic energy is then normalized to a value of @xmath108 , using the total integrated gas pressure of the torus .",
    "different regions within the torus will , of course , have larger or smaller values of @xmath116 .",
    "the strongest initial fields are found between the pressure maximum and the inner edge of the torus .",
    "the simulation is run to time @xmath178 ( 15.6 orbits ) .",
    "the evolution of this torus is illustrated with a series of grayscale plots in @xmath179 ( fig .",
    "4 ) of vertical @xmath38 and equatorial @xmath180 slices . as with the axisymmetric torus ( fig .",
    "3 ) , the initial phase of evolution is controlled by the shear amplification of the toroidal field . however , in three - dimensions this toroidal field is itself unstable to the mri .",
    "the characteristic large - wavenumber structures associated with the instability quickly appear in the inner regions of the disk ( by @xmath181 ) .",
    "this creates turbulence , and momentarily increases the mass accretion rate over that seen in the axisymmetric simulation ( fig .",
    "5 ) . by @xmath129 the disk",
    "contains tightly wrapped , low @xmath1 trailing spiral waves .",
    "the presence of this nonaxisymmetric structure affects the development of the poloidal field instability , eliminating the organized radial streaming flows seen in axisymmetry .",
    "the flow is more turbulent and the mass accretion rate is steadier , without the large impulsive spikes in @xmath182 associated with the radial streaming in two dimensions .",
    "this overall turbulence declines after saturation of the mri , but continues through the end of the run .",
    "this is the stage when the accretion rate in the two - dimensional simulation drops to very small levels . while in three dimensions one might hope that the disk could achieve a nearly steady state mass accretion rate ,",
    "there is , of course , only a finite amount of disk mass available to accrete . at the end of the run 85% of the initial total mass has been lost from the grid , most of it through the innermost stable orbit .",
    "the amount of mass ejected off the outer boundary is about 30% of that accreted through the inner boundary .",
    "although the total volume - averaged magnetic energy drops with time beyond @xmath183 , most of this decline is due to loss from accretion .",
    "average @xmath116 after @xmath129 is @xmath184 and remains fairly constant thereafter .",
    "the magnetic energy is dominated by the toroidal component ; the poloidal field @xmath116 value has an average value of @xmath185 , and also remains nearly constant after @xmath129 . in the axisymmetric simulation",
    "the poloidal @xmath116 value attains a value of @xmath186 at @xmath187 , but rises steadily to @xmath188 by @xmath164 , indicating a poloidal magnetic energy loss rate exceeding that due to accretion alone .",
    "angular momentum transport results in rapid restructuring of the disk .",
    "the angular momentum distribution in the inner half of the torus steepens to a nearly keplerian value by @xmath144 ( fig .",
    "the angular momentum in the outer part of the torus increases over the remainder of the simulation . at the end time",
    "the angular velocity @xmath189 has a slope near @xmath190 .",
    "this is essentially the same as in the axisymmetric run above ( represented by the short dashed line in fig .",
    "this slope adequately characterizes the disk since the angular momentum , and hence angular velocity , is nearly constant on cylinders .",
    "after turbulence has developed , the average @xmath10 values in the main part of the disk are between 0.1 and 0.2 .",
    "the ratio of the maxwell to reynolds stress varies , but lies between 1 and 4 throughout the main part of the disk . the time- and space - averaged value of @xmath85 after @xmath129 is 0.40 .",
    "figure 6 shows that the specific angular momentum continues to decline even inside the marginally stable orbit .",
    "this indicates that even here there remains a significant net stress .",
    "in fact , inside the marginally stable orbit @xmath10 rapidly increases because the gas pressure drops while the maxwell stress remains roughly constant .",
    "the presence of this stress means there is no maximum in the epicyclic frequency , @xmath191 . in the pseudo - newtonian potential ( and , of course in the relativistic potential",
    "that the pseudo - newtonian potential was designed to imitate ) , the keplerian value of @xmath192 has a maximum that occurs at about @xmath193 .",
    "more generally , the epicyclic frequency will go to zero at a stress - free inner edge of a disk where @xmath194 , ensuring a @xmath195 maximum somewhere in the disk . here , however , the inner boundary of the disk is not characterized by a zero - stress condition , the slope of @xmath196 is nearly constant , and the epicyclic frequency does not turn over but continues to rise .",
    "it has been proposed that potentially observable oscillatory modes might be trapped near the disk inner edge where the epicyclic frequency turns over ( e.g. , nowak & wagoner 1993 ) .",
    "the present result must be regarded as preliminary , but if significant stress inside the marginally stable orbit proves to be a generic property of magnetic turbulence , trapped disk oscillations may not be present .    in some respects ,",
    "the two- and three - dimensional simulations are similar .",
    "they both have shear amplification of toroidal field , they both evolve due to the resulting increase in toroidal magnetic pressure , and they both develop turbulence due to the poloidal field mri . both rapidly evolve from constant to nearly keplerian specific angular momentum distributions ( fig .",
    "the three dimensional simulation , however , permits the development of the nonaxisymmetric mri which increases and sustains turbulence and mass accretion . in two dimensions the organized poloidal field channel solution produces an impulsive accretion rate greater than that seen in three dimensions during the initial saturation of the poloidal mri .",
    "but axisymmetry causes the two - dimensional poloidal field to decline , and with it the maxwell stress .",
    "the contrast between @xmath85 in the three- and the two - dimensional simulations is instructive ( fig .",
    "7 ) . in three dimensions",
    "@xmath85 remains relatively constant and near the value typically seen in the local shearing box simulations . in two dimensions",
    "@xmath85 declines steadily with time following the saturation of the mri .",

    "two dimensional simulations are useful for searching a wide range of initial conditions in support of the more challenging three - dimensional models .",
    "to test the idea of using an evolved two - dimensional simulation as an initial condition , consider next a constant-@xmath41 torus with an initial inner edge at @xmath197 and a pressure maximum at @xmath198 where @xmath124 .",

    "this time corresponds to shortly before the nonlinear aspects of the mri first manifest themselves noticeably in the density plots .",
    "random pressure perturbations are added to break the axisymmetry .",
    "while this initialization procedure reduces the total computational time required , it does nt allow the toroidal field instability the opportunity to grow during the initial phase .",
    "this means that the strong coherent poloidal field instability develops as it does in two dimensions .",
    "nevertheless , significant nonaxisymmetric structure appears by @xmath183 , and the overall turbulence is increased over that seen in axisymmetry .",
    "accretion inflow at the inner boundary is about twice what it is in two dimensions after this point in time .",

    "these curves are very similar to those in figure 2 from ct3 .",
    "gt2 shows a stronger initial field amplification phase and a stronger mri saturation ( created by initializing from the axisymmetric run ) .",
    "however the magnetic field amplitudes and stress levels are comparable at late times in both simulations .",
    "these similarities indicate that the cylindrical limit provides a useful approximation for investigating the nonlinear evolution of mhd turbulence near the midplane of a disk .    to summarize",
    ", gt2 shows that fully three dimensional turbulence can be rapidly produced and sustained in a simulation initialized from the output of an axisymmetric simulation .",
    "the late - time properties of such a simulation , essentially one with complicated nonlinear initial perturbations , are quite similar to those obtained from a simulation evolved from a formal equilibrium and linear perturbations .",

    "the mass accretion rate is larger in three dimensions compared to two . near",
    "the end of the simulation , @xmath87 at the inner radial boundary is approximately 2.5 times that seen in axisymmetry .",
    "the value of @xmath85 is rising with time indicating that the poloidal field strength is still increasing at the end of the simulation .",
    "figure 14 shows the radial mass and angular momentum distributions at the initial and final times in gt4 .",
    "also shown are curves from two times in the equivalent axisymmetric calculation .",
    "the average angular velocity parameter @xmath50 decreases by a very small amount over the course of the evolution .",
    "the torus mass , on the other hand , has been substantially redistributed .",
    "in this paper , we have carried out global mhd simulations of accretion tori .",
    "we have also made use of several different limits or approximations : two dimensional axisymmetry , and three dimensional cylindrical gravitational potential , in addition to the full three dimensional global model .",
    "in addition to the intrinsic interest in the results , these simulations begin to map out what is currently possible with the present hardware and algorithms .",
    "first , how useful are the two - dimensional and cylindrical approximations ?",
    "while neither should be relied on exclusively , they both have appropriate applications , and they greatly reduce the computational difficulty of the simulations .",
    "two - dimensional axisymmetric torus simulations demonstrate effects from the generation of toroidal field due to shear , and from the development of the poloidal field mri .",
    "the latter leads to turbulence , rapid angular momentum transport and evolution toward a nearly keplerian angular momentum distribution .",
    "a significant limitation of the axisymmetric system , however , is embodied in cowling s antidynamo theorem .",
    "the @xmath227 component of the vector potential is conserved , except for losses due to dissipative processes .",
    "poloidal field can grow from axisymmetric stretching and folding , but this is ultimately limited . in the simulations , after the nonlinear saturation of the mri , the poloidal magnetic field energies decline and the turbulence begins to die out .    despite this",
    ", considerable similarity is seen between the two- and three - dimensional simulations .",
    "this is due to the dominance in the initial stages of the torus evolution by what is largely axisymmetric dynamics : increase in toroidal field pressure due to shear , the development of the `` channel solution , '' and the rapid redistribution of angular momentum by large stresses . during phases of a disk s evolution when such effects are most important , two - dimensional simulations are a good approximation",
    ". their utility must be limited , however , since genuine nonaxisymmetric effects , including the development of the toroidal field mri , dynamo amplification and maintenance of poloidal fields , and nonaxisymmetric spiral waves , are generally of dominant importance over the long term .",
    "cylindrical disks are a natural extension of the shearing box model .",
    "the cylindrical disk , like the shearing box simulations of hgb and hgb2 , does not include the effects of vertical gravity .",
    "cylindrical keplerian disk simulations , initialized with vertical fields or toroidal fields show rapid development of the mri consistent with the shearing box results . field amplification and stress levels are comparable between the two types of simulation as well . with the cylindrical disk , however , we are able to observe the direct consequences of the stress : redistribution of angular momentum toward keplerian , and mass accretion .",
    "cylindrical disk simulations can provide detailed information about the radial dependence of the growth and saturation of the mri , the resulting mhd turbulence , the transport of angular momentum , and the net accretion flow .",
    "simulations of cylindrical constant angular momentum tori with vertical or toroidal initial fields illustrate many aspects of a full global evolution .",
    "regardless of the initial field configuration , the initially constant angular momentum tori evolve toward radial angular momentum distributions that are nearly , but not quite , keplerian .",
    "the final outcome is largely the same for either initial vertical or toroidal fields , although the early growth of the mri is more rapid for vertical fields , and dominated by small scale structure for toroidal fields .",
    "this is entirely consistent with the local linear analysis .",
    "of course , we want to simulate disks fully globally and with as few approximations or geometric constraints as possible .",
    "indeed , full three dimensionality is essential .",
    "cylindrical simulations can provide little , if any , information about the vertical structure of a disk , energy transport , or the possible formation of winds or jets .    as with the cylindrical disk simulations , the overall evolution of fully global tori are consistent with the intuitions developed from shearing box simulations .",
    "the mri grows rapidly , and produces mhd turbulence that transports angular momentum . in all cases , toroidal field dominates , followed by radial and then vertical field .",
    "one difference is that the shearing box calculations with zero net field ( e.g. , hgb2 ) typically have a total stress value of @xmath88 , whereas here @xmath6 in the heart of the turbulent disks .",
    "this is more a matter of the magnetic pressure that is sustained in the torus versus the shearing box , rather than some qualitative difference in the behavior of the mri . in both the global and local simulations , the stress is directly proportional to @xmath228 : @xmath229 .",
    "all of the present global simulations began with relatively strong field , either in the form of poloidal field loops which immediately generated strong toroidal field through shear , or from the presence of an initially strong toroidal field .",
    "this field strength is by and large sustained , and thus the observed @xmath10 values are consistent with @xmath230 .",
    "it is suggestive that matsumoto ( 1999 ) also obtained @xmath231 for his toroidal field simulations , even one that began with @xmath232 .",
    "global ( rather than local ) length scales make it natural to have larger magnetic field strengths in the saturated state .",
    "computational problems associated with the inner boundary are greatly reduced through the use of the pseudo - newtonian potential .",
    "this provides a physical inner radius for the disks , and ensures that gas and field will flow smoothly off the inner radial grid .",
    "the accretion flow rapidly accelerates inward near @xmath233 , with the radial speed quickly exceeding the sound speed .",
    "interestingly , the angular momentum continues to drop inside of @xmath233 , indicating the continuing presence of maxwell stress .",
    "the absence of a stress - free inner disk boundary is one of the ways in which these disks differ from standard analytic models .",
    "one immediate conclusion from these simulations is that the constant , or nearly - constant angular momentum torus is a remarkably unstable structure in the presence of a weak magnetic field .",
    "the mhd turbulence resulting from the mri simply transports angular momentum too efficiently . within a few orbits the angular momentum distribution changes from @xmath51 to @xmath234 .",
    "the tori considered here did not remain maintain their initial constant angular momentum distribution long enough to develop the coherent structures associated with the nonlinear outcome of the papaloizou - pringle instability .",
    "this does not , however , necessarily imply that accretion disks must be thin .",
    "moderately thick configurations , as seen in the grayscale plots , are still possible even for nearly keplerian angular momentum distributions , if there is significant internal pressure .",
    "averaged properties of the torus such as density , pressure or angular momentum distribution fail to convey the impression of disorder seen in animations of the evolution .",
    "low density , high magnetic field filaments entwine themselves throughout the torus",
    ". regions of strong field develop and rise through the torus into the surrounding low - density atmosphere .",
    "low density material flows outward around the bulk of the torus .",
    "since angular momentum transport is by mhd turbulence , it follows that the disk should be highly dynamic .",
    "the effect of this on observed properties of disks must be considered in subsequent , more sophisticated simulations .",
    "it is not premature , however , to question the relevance of the traditional image of a quiescent steady - state disk .",
    "there remain several limitations to the present simulations to be addressed in subsequent work .",
    "first , greater grid resolution is always welcome , particularly where the accretion inflow is squeezed into a narrow equatorial flow , or for following the growth of the mri from substantially weaker initial field strengths .",
    "because the disks develop oscillations across the equatorial plane , particularly in the simulations that begin with poloidal field loops , the full @xmath38 plane must be simulated in global models , without applying explicit ( e.g. , reflecting ) equatorial boundary conditions .",
    "this doubles the number of grid zones required , but appears to be necessary .",
    "higher resolution simulations are feasible with the addition of more processors to the parallel computation .",
    "the simulations described here used a maximum of 64 .",
    "indeed , a great many issues can be profitably investigated using simulations with more grid zones .",
    "for example , the global simulations presented here featured tori that began close to the marginally stable orbit .",
    "little evolution is required to accrete through @xmath233 and into the central hole .",
    "simulating a greater dynamic range in disk radii , for longer times and with larger numbers of radial grid zones , is an immediate next goal .",
    "the present simulations focus only on the dynamical properties of mhd in tori .",
    "as the thermodynamic properties of the disk are of obvious importance in establishing an overall global disk structure , further algorithm development is desirable . in the present simulations",
    "the simplified equation of state and lack of explicit resistivity mean that the only sources of gas heating are artificial shock viscosity and adiabatic compression .",
    "some amount of energy is necessarily lost through the numerical reconnection of magnetic field .",
    "further , neither radiative transport nor simple radiative losses were included .",
    "these and other issues of global disk evolution must be deferred to subsequent work .    this work is supported in part by nasa grants nag5 - 3058 and nag5 - 7500 .",
    "three dimensional simulations were run on the cray t90 and t3e systems operated by the san diego supercomputer center with resources provided through a national resource allocation grant from the national science foundation .",
    "the three - dimensional torus simulation gt4 was run by greg lindahl on a cluster of 64 alpha processors , part of the centurion system developed by the legion project at the university of virginia .",
    "a portion of this work was completed while attending the program on black hole astrophysics at the institute for theoretical physics , supported in part by the nsf under grant no .",
