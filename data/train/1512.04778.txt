    "densification has been recognized as an effective way to meet the exponentially growing mobile data traffic and to accommodate increasingly diversified mobile applications .",
    "cooperative transmission / reception among multiple base stations is a well - known approach to improve the spectral efficiency and energy efficiency of dense wireless networks @xcite , which is driving the development of novel collaborative architectures for cellular networks .",
    "cloud radio access networks ( cloud - ran ) @xcite have recently been proposed as a cost - effective and flexible way to exploit the cooperation gains by moving the baseband units ( bbus ) into a single cloud data center , i.e. , forming a bbu pool with powerful shared computing resources . as a result , with efficient hardware utilization at the bbu pool , both",
    "the capex ( e.g. , via low - cost site construction ) and opex ( e.g. , via centralized cooling ) can be reduced significantly .",
    "furthermore , the conventional base stations are replaced by the light and low - cost remote radio heads ( rrhs ) with basic functionalities of signal transmission and reception , which are then connected to the bbu pool by high - capacity and low - latency optical fronthaul links .",
    "the capacity of cloud - ran thus can be significantly improved through network densification and centralized signal processing at the bbu pool .",
    "however , the new architecture of cloud - ran also brings new design and operating challenges , e.g. , high - capacity and low - latency requirements for the optical fronthaul links @xcite , virtualization techniques for resource management in the bbu pool @xcite , and massive csi acquisition for cooperative interference management @xcite . in particular , energy efficiency is an important aspect for operating such a dense wireless network , and it is among the major design objectives for 5 g networks @xcite .",
    "conventionally , the energy efficiency oriented design only takes into account the transmit power @xcite and the circuit power @xcite at the base stations .",
    "nevertheless , in such dense collaborative networks as cloud - ran , a holistic view is needed when measuring network power consumption , which should also include the power consumption of the additional optical fronthaul links @xcite . observing that the mobile data traffic would vary temporally and spatially ,",
    "it was proposed in [ 5 ] to adaptively switch off some fronthaul links and the corresponding rrhs to minimize the network power consumption , which is achieved by a new beamforming technique , called _ group sparse beamforming_.    the effectiveness of group sparse beamforming has been demonstrated in [ 5 ] , but with certain limitations in the network model , e.g. , perfect csi is assumed at the bbu pool , and only unicast services are considered . in practice , inevitably there will be uncertainty in the available csi , originating from various sources , e.g. , limited feedback @xcite , channel estimation errors @xcite , partial csi acquisition @xcite and delay in the obtained csi @xcite . in terms of transmission services from the rrhs , it has been well recognized that the physical layer integration technique @xcite can effectively improve the network performance .",
    "in particular , the rrhs should not only transmit data to individual users @xcite ( i.e. , broadcast / unicast services ) but also integrate additional multicast services @xcite , where the rrhs transmit a common message in such a way that all the mus in the same group can decode it .",
    "such multigroup multicast transmission is promising to provide high capacity services and content - aware applications in next generation wireless networks .",
    "for instance , with physical layer caching for wireless video delivery @xcite , it is common that multiple users are interested in the same video stream , which creates multicast groups .    in this paper",
    ", we will thus focus on the design of green cloud - ran by jointly minimizing the rrh power consumption and transport link power consumption , considering the practical scenarios with imperfect csi and multigroup multicast services .",
    "we adopt the robust optimization approach to address the csi uncertainty , such that the qos requirements are satisfied for _ any _ realization of the uncertainty in a predefined set @xcite .",
    "the unique challenges of the network power minimization problem arise from both the infinite number of the non - convex quadratic qos constraints ( due to the robust design criteria and multicast transmission ) and the combinatorial composite objective function ( due to the consideration of both the relative fronthaul link power consumption and the rrh transmit power consumption ) .",
    "although the integration of multicast , individual services and cooperative transmission can significantly improve the capacity of wireless networks @xcite , it will bring significant challenges from both the information theoretic @xcite and signal processing perspectives @xcite . in particular , the physical - layer multicast beamforming problem is in general np - hard due to the non - convex quadratic qos constraints @xcite .",
    "furthermore , to address the csi uncertainty , one may either adopt the stochastic optimization formulation @xcite or the robust optimization formulation @xcite .",
    "however , the stochastic optimization formulations often yield highly intractable problems , e.g. , the stochastic coordinated beamforming problem based on the chance constrained programming @xcite .",
    "the worst - case based robust optimization , on the other hand , has the advantage of computational tractability @xcite .",
    "although the original robust and/or multicast beamforming design problems may be non - convex due to the infinite number of non - convex quadratic qos constraints @xcite , the convex optimization based sdr technique @xcite with s - lemma @xcite has recently been applied to provide a principled way to develop polynomial time complexity algorithms to find an approximate solution @xcite .",
    "however , we can not directly apply such sdr technique to solve the network power minimization problem due to the non - convex combinatorial composite objective function , which represents the network power consumption .",
    "the convex sparsity - inducing penalty approach @xcite has recently been widely used to develop polynomial time complexity algorithms for the mixed combinatorial optimization problems in wireless networks , e.g. , joint base station clustering and transmit beamforming @xcite , joint antenna @xcite or rrh @xcite selection and transmit beamforming .",
    "the main idea of this approach is that the sparsity pattern of the beamforming vector , which can be induced by minimizing a sparsity penalty function ( e.g. , the mixed @xmath0-norm minimization can induce the group - sparsity ) , can provide guidelines for , e.g. , antenna selection @xcite , where the antennas with smaller beamforming coefficients ( measured by the @xmath1-norm ) have a higher priority to be switched off .",
    "however , most works only consider the ideal scenario ( e.g. , perfect csi and broadcast services @xcite ) , which usually yield convex constraints ( e.g. , second - order cone constraints @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , we can not directly adopt the _ non - smooth _ weighted mixed @xmath0-norm developed in @xcite to induce the group - sparsity for the robust multicast beamforming vector .",
    "this is because the resultant group - sparsity inducing optimization problem will be highly intractable , due to the non - smooth sparsity - inducing objective function and the infinite number of non - convex quadratic qos constraints .    based on above discussion and in contrast to the previous work @xcite on group sparse beamforming with a non - convex combinatorial composite objective function but convex qos constraints in the unicast cloud - ran",
    ", we need to address the following coupled challenges in order to solve the network power minimization problem for multicast green cloud - ran with imperfect csi :    * an infinite number of non - convex quadratic qos constraints ; * the combinatorial composite objective function .",
    "thus , to apply the computationally efficient group sparse beamforming approach @xcite to more practical scenarios , unique challenges arise .",
    "we need to redesign the group - sparsity inducing norm , and then deal with the non - convex group - sparsity inducing optimization problem with an infinite number of non - convex quadratic qos constraints .",
    "we should also develop efficient algorithms for non - convex feasibility problems for the adaptive rrh selection , and for non - convex robust multicast beamforming design after determining the active rrhs .      in this paper",
    ", we provide a convex relaxation based robust group sparse beamforming framework for network power minimization in multicast cloud - ran with imperfect csi .",
    "the major contributions are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "a group sparse beamforming formulation is proposed to minimize the network power consumption for cloud - ran .",
    "it will simultaneously control the group - sparsity structure and the magnitude of the beamforming coefficients , thereby minimizing the relative fronthaul link power consumption and the transmit power consumption , respectively .",
    "the group sparse beamforming modeling framework lays the foundation for developing the three - stage robust group sparse beamforming algorithm based on the convex relaxation .",
    "2 .   in the first stage",
    ", a novel quadratic variational formulation of the weighted mixed @xmath0-norm is proposed to induce the group - sparsity structure for the robust multicast beamforming vector , thereby guiding the rrh selection .",
    "the main motivation for such a quadratic form formulation is to make the group - sparsity inducing penalty function compatible with the quadratic qos constraints .",
    "based on the sdr technique , a perturbed alternating optimization algorithm with convergence guarantee is then proposed to solve the resultant non - convex quadratic form group - sparsity inducing optimization problem by exploiting its convex substructures .",
    "3 .   in the second stage ,",
    "a _ phaselift _",
    "approach based algorithm is proposed to solve the non - convex feasibility problems , based on which the active rrhs can be determined with a binary search .",
