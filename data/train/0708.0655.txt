    "these authors created a grid of solar - metallicity spectral models , for which they measured a pair of spectral indices : the h@xmath21o@xmath76 index ( table [ tab_indices ] ) , and an index _ k / h _ measuring the ratio of the heights of the _ k _ and _ h _ peaks .",

    "the ratio of the actual index over the model index provides a scaling , which is used to calibrate the grid of model indices .",
    "the properties , log@xmath77 , of any cool brown dwarf are then determined by comparing the measured indices against the calibrated model indices , and determining the best fit .",
    "an advantage of the method is that it does not require the distance of the object to be known , since the spectral indices record flux ratios .",
    "nevertheless the effect on the measured parameters of varying metallicity away from solar was not explored ( except for one source ) .",
    "interestingly , @xcite estimated a value of @xmath78k for the t8 dwarf 2mass 0939@xmath02448 and the t7.5 dwarf 1114@xmath02618 , lower than the effective temperature determined for 2mass  j0415@xmath009 .",

    "the measured values of the two indices for the three sources gl  570d , 2mass  j0415@xmath009 , and ulas  j0034@xmath000  are provided in table [ tab_newindices ] . for interest",
    "we have also provided the measured values for the t7.5 dwarf hd3651b @xcite .",
    "a brief discussion of this source is provided at the end of this section , but for the remainder we consider only the first three sources .",
    "the table includes the measured indices , as well as the values normalised to the measured indices of 2mass  j0415@xmath009 .",
    "the published spectra of gl  570d  and 2mass  j0415@xmath009  are of much higher s / n than the spectrum of ulas  j0034@xmath000  we have obtained , so the lack of error spectra for gl  570d  and 2mass  j0415@xmath009  is unimportant in this analysis .",
    "the _ k / j _ indices for the three sources are all quite similar , while for @xmath86 the measured index decreases through the sequence gl  570d , 2mass  j0415@xmath009 , ulas  j0034@xmath000 , quantifying the progressive narrowing of the _",
    "j-_band peak visible in figs [ gnirsfull ] and [ gnirszoom ] .    the normalised indices from table  [ tab_newindices ] are plotted in fig .",
    "[ tgplot ] , where the dotted lines outline the @xmath4 ranges for ulas  j0034@xmath000 , along with a grid of solar - metallicity spectral models .",
    "the grid has been scaled to the data by associating the model [ 750 , 5.00 , 0.0 ] with 2mass  j0415@xmath009 , and normalising the indices of all the other models to the measured values for this model . choosing a different model to represent 2mass  j0415@xmath009  merely has the effect of shifting ( and slightly distorting ) the grid in this space such that the new reference model lies at @xmath88 . in this way",
    "it can be seen that the locations of gl  570d  and ulas  j0034@xmath000  imply temperature and gravity differences relative to 2mass  j0415@xmath009  that are , due to the regularity of the grid , almost independent of the actual model chosen to represent 2mass  j0415@xmath009 .",
    "the plot illustrates the fact that the two indices provide complementary information on the two parameters  and log@xmath77 , at fixed metallicity .",
    "the effect of decreasing temperature alone is a decrease in both @xmath86 and @xmath89 , while decreasing gravity alone causes a decrease in @xmath86 , but an increase in @xmath89 .",
    "if 2mass  j0415@xmath009  and ulas  j0034@xmath000  have similar metallicity , the plot indicates that ulas  j0034@xmath000  has  between 60 and 120k cooler , and log @xmath77 between 0.25 and 0.5 lower .",
    "because only two indices are used , the three parameters , log@xmath77 , [ m / h ] can not be determined independently .",
    "the effect of varying metallicity is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ tgplot ] , by reference to the model [ 650 , 4.75 , 0.0 ] .",
    "the dashed line through this model shows the effect of varying the metallicity over the range @xmath90[m / h]@xmath91 .",
    "because the line approximately follows the line of constant gravity , varying metallicity has little effect on the temperature estimate , but , rather , is nearly degenerate with gravity .",
    "this degeneracy may be described by the relation @xmath92(log@xmath93[m / h ] .",
    "therefore ulas  j0034@xmath000  is of lower gravity or higher metallicity than 2mass  j0415@xmath009  as described by the limits @xmath94(log@xmath10[m / h]@xmath11 .",
    "the properties of 2mass  j0415@xmath009  were determined by @xcite to lie along a narrow line from , log@xmath77 of 725 , 5.00 to 775 , 5.37 . adopting 750 , 5.20 for 2mass  j0415@xmath009  implies @xmath8 ( @xmath4 range ) for ulas  j0034@xmath000 .",
    "the temperature estimate from the spectral modelling is in good agreement with the estimate derived from the _ h_@xmath0[4.49 ] colour of @xmath95k ( @xmath4 range ) .",
    "combining these two independent estimates gives an estimate @xmath96 ( @xmath97 error ) , where the uncertainty reflects the random errors in the gnirs spectrum , and the mid - infrared photometry , but takes no account of the uncertainties in the spectroscopic models , in the extrapolation of the temperature - colour relation ( fig .",
    "[ tempcol ] ) , and in the temperature of 2mass  j0415@xmath009 . on the other hand since",
    "the spectroscopic models are calibrated to 2mass  j0415@xmath009  at 750k , it seems very unlikely that ulas  j0034@xmath000  is hotter than 700k .",
    "we adopt the conservative ranges @xmath12k , and @xmath98log@xmath99 , assuming solar metallicity , as the final estimate of the effective temperature and gravity of ulas  j0034@xmath000 .",
    "confirmation of this low effective temperature will require mid - infrared spectroscopy , and measurement of the parallax , both of which are scheduled .",
    "one of the models within the above ranges is [ 650 , 4.5 , 0.0 ] .",
    "the synthetic spectrum generated with these parameters reproduces the observations quite well ( given the known opacity problems ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ datamodel ] .",
    "finally we note that the indices listed in table [ tab_newindices ] for gl  570d  and for hd3651b suggest that the latter is some 50k warmer .",
    "@xcite argued that hd 3651b is of higher gravity than gl  570d , in which case the relative values of the two indices indicate that hd 3651b must also have higher metallicity , in agreement with their findings .",

    "they also demonstrate that photospheric metallicity does not significantly impact the evolutionary parameters in this diagram .",
    "the ranges in and log@xmath77 of 600700k and 4.55.1 , determined above , correspond to ranges in [ age ( gyr ) , mass ( @xmath17 ) ] of [ 0.5 , 15 ] to [ 8 , 36 ] .",

    "<S> we report the discovery of a very cool brown dwarf , ulas j003402.77@xmath0005206.7 ( ulas  j0034@xmath000 ) , identified in the ukirt infrared deep sky survey first data release . </S>",
    "<S> we provide optical , near - infrared , and mid - infrared photometry of the source , and two near - infrared spectra . comparing the spectral energy distribution of ulas  j0034@xmath000  to that of the t8 brown dwarf 2mass j04151954@xmath00935066 ( 2mass  j0415@xmath009 ) , the latest - type and coolest well - studied brown dwarf to date , with effective temperature @xmath1k </S>",
    "<S> , we find evidence that ulas  j0034@xmath000  is significantly cooler . </S>",
    "<S> first , the measured values of the near - infrared absorption spectral indices imply a later classification , of t8.5 . </S>",
    "<S> second , the @xmath2[4.49 ] colour provides an empirical estimate of the effective temperature of @xmath3k ( @xmath4 range ) . </S>",
    "<S> third , the @xmath5- and @xmath6-band peaks are somewhat narrower in ulas  j0034@xmath000 , and detailed comparison against spectral models calibrated to 2mass  j0415@xmath009  yields an estimated temperature lower by @xmath7k relative to 2mass  j0415@xmath009 i.e. @xmath8k ( @xmath4 ) , and lower gravity or higher metallicity according to the degenerate combination @xmath9log@xmath10[m / h]@xmath11 ( @xmath4 ) . combining these estimates , and considering systematics </S>",
    "<S> , it is likely the temperature lies in the range @xmath12k . </S>",
    "<S> measurement of the parallax will allow an additional check of the inferred low temperature . despite the low inferred  </S>",
    "<S> we find no evidence for strong absorption by nh@xmath13 over the wavelength range @xmath14@xmath15@xmath16 m . </S>",
    "<S> evolutionary models imply that the mass and age are in the ranges 1536 @xmath17 and 0.58gyr , respectively </S>",
    "<S> . the measured proper motion , of @xmath18/yr , combined with the photometrically estimated distance of 1422  pc , implies a tangential velocity of @xmath1930  kms@xmath20 , a value consistent with expectation for the inferred age . </S>",
    "<S> ulas  j0034@xmath000  is significantly bluer than 2mass  j0415@xmath009  in , so future searches should allow for the possibility that cooler t dwarfs are bluer still .    </S>",
