    "among giant - planets uranus is unique from several aspects .",
    "firstly , its inner energy source is very weak , so uranus might be expected to have small amount of the atmospheric turbulence .",
    "secondly , uranian rotational pole lies almost in its orbital plane .",
    "this anomalous obliquity allows us to obtain images of different uranian latitudes and causes radical variations in insolation between seasons , in comparison to the other planets .    in recent years",
    ", the observational data of the intensity of the raman scattering features in the giant planet spectra are suggested to be used in determining the relative contribution of the aerosol component of the atmosphere .",
    "this way , we can determine the values of aerosol to gas ratio of the optical depth components @xmath0 and absorbing to scattering ratio @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "dementiev @xcite showed that in uranian atmosphere the aerosol abundance was much larger in 1981 - 1983 than in 1961 - 1973 . in these papers the model of atmosphere was taken to be isothermal , while the real giant planet atmospheres have complex temperature profiles @xcite .",
    "the method of the real temperature profile accounting used in computing the raman scattering effects was developed by morozhenko and kostogryz @xcite .",
    "they estimated the distortion degree of the atmospheric parameters such as @xmath0 and @xmath6 . in the paper",
    "@xcite the real values of these parameters were estimated using observational geometric albedo spectra @xcite .",
    "we should note that sromovsky @xcite is also taking into account the real temperature profile .",
    "he compared the calculated geometric albedo values with the observational ones .    in this paper",
    "we determine the values of the optical parameters such as @xmath0 and @xmath6 using observational data in different years @xcite .",
    "section 2 describes the observational data for uranus .",
    "section 3 contains the review of the atmospheric model .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the method of computation and sections 5 and 6 describe the results of the computation and some conclusions of this work .",
    "to obtain the optical parameters of uranus atmosphere , we used geometric albedo spectra observed by neff et al . @xcite in 1981 and by karkoschka @xcite in 1993 and 1995 .",
    "neff et al .",
    "@xcite derived absolute measurements of the geometric albedo spectra of uranus from 350 to 1050 nm at the resolution of about 0.7 nm . these observations were made with mcdonald observatory 2.1-m telescope and the es-2 spectrograph on 17 - 18 may 1981 ut . the uranus radius is taken to be 25700 km , when the geometric albedo spectra were calculated .",
    "full - disk albedo of uranus derived by karkoschka from observations at the european southern observatory in july 1993 @xcite and in july 1995 @xcite .",
    "the spectra extend from 300- to 1000-nm wavelength at 1-nm resolution . in 1995",
    "the spectra extend from 300 to 1050 nm wavelength .",
    "the spectral resolution was 0.4 nm between 520 and 995 nm , and 1 nm elsewhere .",
    "planetary radius was taken to be 25450 km .",
    "the geometric albedo spectra of uranus in spectral region from 390 to 845 nm at 2-nm resolution derived by dementiev @xcite was not considered because of the low resolution and large errors ( near 10@xmath7 ) in violet region of the spectra .    for our investigations in all observational data",
    "we ve just used the spectral region from 350 to 430 nm where the methane band are very weak or almost absent .",
    "the differences in geometric albedo spectra are near @xmath8 for observational data of karkoschka @xcite and neff et al.@xcite .",
    "the reason for these changes could be either real variations in planetary atmosphere or errors made in the data reduction ( for example , for different planetary radii or comparison stars ) . as we can not correct errors for using different comparison stars",
    ", we take that errors arise due to the different planetary radii .",
    "we assumed that visible radius of uranus was not changed in comparably short time period and reduce all data to @xmath9 km .",
    "but the corrections for the different radii have small influence on the geometric albedo time variations .",
    "so , most likely , these distinctions are due to the real variations of the physical parameters of uranus atmosphere .",
    "later on we try to find the reasons for these differences .",
    "as in previous papers , we used the model of the homogeneous semi - infinite gas - aerosol layer with relative concentration of hydrogen ( 85@xmath7 ) and helium ( 15@xmath7 ) .",
    "we also consider nonisothermal atmosphere of uranus using experimental temperature profiles @xcite .",
    "raman scattering is considered for four major hydrogen transitions : the rotational transitions s(0 ) , s(1 ) and o(2 ) and the vibrational one @xmath10 , which produce significant `` raman ghosts '' .",
    "raman shifts and cross sections at 400 nm of several transitions of molecules of interest in planetary atmospheres were taken from cochran and trafton @xcite .    at the temperatures of planetary atmospheres , most of the molecules are in the lower rotational levels of the ground vibrational state .",
    "therefore , the stokes component of the raman scattering will dominate .",
    "the molecule will absorb energy and the photon will emerge at lower frequency , i.e. longer wavelength .",
    "the values of the effective pressure on the intensity where the diffuse reflected irradiation is forming were taken from morozhenko @xcite",
    "to take into account the raman scattering effects , pollack s equation for the single - scattering albedo was used @xcite .",
    "pollack considered only the @xmath11 vibrational transition , which alone would be unable to generate the ghost features arising from the rotational transitions .",
    "sromovsky @xcite compared different models with raman scattering taken into account .",
    "he said that the problem pollack s original formulation was that it resulted in @xmath12 at some wavelengths , as noted by courtin @xcite , which leads to instability in the solution of the radiation transfer equation .",
    "he propose his own approximation for molecular single scattering albedo .",
    "we also propose more precise expression for the single - scattering albedo , and the form given in eq.[omega ] taking into account rotational @xmath13 and vibrational @xmath14 transitions .",
    "@xmath15    @xmath16-a \\label{pard}\\ ] ]    @xmath17    where @xmath18 are values of the energy in the solar spectrum at the wavelength from which rotation @xmath13 and vibration @xmath14 stokes transitions of the raman scattering carries the sun s photon on wavelength @xmath19 accordingly ; @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the optical depths of the raman scattering of the corresponding transitions , @xmath22 - the amount of hydrogen molecule in ortho- and para- state .",
    "firstly , we estimated the spectral values of the single - scattering albedo , comparing the observational geometric albedo spectra @xcite with the theoretical one , computed for the homogeneous semi - infinite layer ( ovsak @xcite ) .",
    "we used the rayleigh phase function .",
    "the values of d depend on the effective level of diffuse - reflected irradiation forming .",
    "also we used the approximate values of the effective pressure of this irradiation forming for uranus disk in 376 - 439 nm wavelengths .",
    "afterwords , using the following expression @xmath23 we found the values of @xmath24 which were anomalous due to the presence of the raman scattering . here",
    "obviously , b will be changed with the wavelength changing in the case of the absence of the raman scattering effects ( except for the errors of the observational data ) .",
    "the real values of the ratio @xmath26 are @xmath27}{1+a(\\lambda)}\\ ] ]    we supposed that @xmath28 weakly depends on the wavelength in a very narrow spectral region @xmath29 .",
    "thus in the first approximation we neglected this dependence .",
    "then the values of @xmath30 were varied to obtain the minimum dispersion of @xmath31 in each spectral region .",
    "we analyzed the geometric albedo spectra of uranus in different years in the spectral region 350 - 430 nm and obtained values of @xmath28 and @xmath31 ( fig.1 ) .",
    "it is necessary to note here that the uncertainties of the geometric albedo determination have effect only on @xmath31 determination .    ) for uranus in different years .",
    "observational data marked with dotted line ; short dotted line are for the gas atmosphere ( @xmath32 ) ; and solid line is for the real @xmath31 ]    without the raman scattering influence .",
    "we can see that in the spectral region where the intensities of the fraunhofer lines are strong , the values of @xmath30 are much greater than in the region without those lines .",
    "unfortunately , we are still not able to assume the reason for this phenomena .",
    "the possibility that it occurs due to the not fully correct calculations for the raman scattering effects in our method can not be excluded .",
    "the observational correlation between @xmath30 and @xmath26 ( table 1 ) confirms the supposition that the temporal variations of the geometric albedo spectra are due to the amount of absorbing aerosol which changes in the planetary atmosphere .",
    ".the values of @xmath30 in spectral region from 390 to 399 nm in different years ; the values of @xmath26 for 393-nm wavelength and also the ratio of the value of the geometric albedo for the fraunhofer line kcaii to its ghost . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table 1 we adduce the ratio of the geometric albedo values for the fraunhofer line kcaii @xmath34 and for its ghost @xmath35 in various years . as the raman scattering effects decrease",
    "when the values of @xmath30 increase , we can conclude that the observational variations of @xmath36 are due to the variation of the aerosol component of the planetary atmosphere .",
    "as we analyzed @xmath30 variations in various years and the latitude of the center of the visible disk variations , it is readily seen that @xmath30 decreases when the latitude of the visible disk center decreases ( from -65@xmath37 in 1981 to -35@xmath37 in 1995 ) .",
    "this regularity is confirmed by dementiev @xcite and rages et al @xcite .",
    "they claim that the aerosol abundance was much less in uranus atmosphere in 1961 - 1973 than in 1981 - 1983 .",
    "the latitude of the visible disk center in 1961 was -22@xmath37 while in 1981 it was -65@xmath37 .",
    "the qualitative explanation of this effect was given by different authors @xcite .",
    "they have observed that the aerosol cloud features mostly occupied the moderate latitudes .",
    "in this paper we determined the spectral values of @xmath38 and @xmath26 for uranus , using the method of the optical parameter determinations with the use of the raman scattering details for nonisothermal atmosphere @xcite .    using this data we can make the following conclusions :    1 .",
    "the values of @xmath38 and @xmath26 vary in time and depend on the horizontal inhomogeneity of the uranus disk ; 2 .",
    "the possible cause of the long - period variations of the uranus geometrical albedo spectra , which also depend on the latitude , is inhomogeneous aerosol distribution .",
    "i thank a.v.morozhenko and a.p.vidmachenko for good advices and useful discussion of obtained results . and",
    "also i express my appreciation to kathy rages for a very cogent review and useful discussion .",
