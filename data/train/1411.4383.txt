    "loop quantum gravity @xcite , @xcite is a theory of quantum geometry .",
    "it describes the quantisation of general relativity , and as such it is expected to reproduce gravity in a semiclassical limit @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . on the other hand , gravity has been described as an entropic force @xcite and this idea has been studied in many different fields including loop quantum gravity @xcite , @xcite .    in this article",
    "we propose a way to produce an entropic force in loop quantum gravity which involves the mathematical technology of random walks on graphs .",
    "we will work on this in the next section .",
    "we start by considering the interaction of a gravity state space and a particle state space as described in @xcite .",
    "our proposal then is that the hamiltonian of the particle on a fixed gravity state space can be thought of as describing a random walk on a special weighted graph .",
    "the random walk is a motion on the graph , in a probabilistic way , such that there is a tendency for the particle to be localised most probable at some vertices than at others .",
    "by defining a local entropy at each vertex of the graph , at special cases we can make the particle to be localised at the most probable vertex and at the place where entropy is maximised .",
    "this clearly points at some kind of entropic force which can be interpreted as a result of the interaction of a particle with some special gravity state space .",
    "or in other words , loop quantum gravity is really able to reproduce gravity as we know it .",
    "could this special gravity state spaces be semiclassical ?",
    "could they guide us to where we should look in order to obtain the semiclassical limit of loop quantum gravity ?",
    "in this section we describe our proposal of entropic motion in loop quantum gravity which may lead us to entropic forces and to gravity . throughout this article all physical constants used in loop quantum gravity",
    "are considered to be equal to @xmath0 ; except for @xmath1 , the newton s gravitational constant .",
    "the quantum states of the gravitational field in loop quantum gravity , are given by a set of graphs , called spin networks .",
    "of finite(or countable ) sets , such that @xmath2 and @xmath3 consist of unordered pairs of elements of @xmath4 .",
    "the set @xmath4 is known as the set of vertices , and the set @xmath3 is known as the set of edges . ]",
    "each spin network graph @xmath5 , has an edge colouring and a vertex colouring .",
    "an edge colouring is a function @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the set of positive half integers . for any adjacent edges . ]",
    "it is customary to denote the elements of @xmath4 by @xmath8 , and the elements of @xmath3 by @xmath9 , as well as the colouring , @xmath10 , ( figure 1 ) .",
    "we will use a different notation for the edges @xmath3 . if vertex @xmath11 is joined by an edge to vertex @xmath12",
    ", we denote it by @xmath13 and its colour by @xmath14 .",
    "the set of vertices are thought of as chunks of space containing quantum volume whereas the set of edges are thought of as quantum surfaces separating chunks of space .",
    "the colour of edge @xmath13 , represents a quantum surface which area is discrete and given by    @xmath15    a spin network graph @xmath16 is interpreted in loop quantum gravity , as a discrete quantum space .",
    "let @xmath17 be a graph which vertices and edges are the same as those of the spin network @xmath16 , but weighted in a different way .",
    "let the colour of edge @xmath13 be @xmath18 , see figure [ 2 ] .",
    "let us focus on graph @xmath17 and consider some graph theory definitions @xcite",
    ", @xcite .",
    "define the degree of a vertex @xmath19 by @xmath20 , where the sum is over all edges adjacent to @xmath11 .",
    "the adjacency matrix of weighted graph @xmath17 , is an @xmath21 matrix defined by @xmath22 , with rows and columns indexed by @xmath23 , and whose entries are the edge weights .",
    "the degree matrix of weighted graph @xmath17 , is defined by @xmath24 .",
    "it is the diagonal matrix indexed by @xmath23 with the degree of the vertices on the diagonal .",
    "define the matrix    @xmath25    consider the set of all functions @xmath26 from the set of vertices to the real numbers .",
    "this set of functions defines a vector space isomorphic to @xmath27 endowed with the inner product    @xmath28     associated to the particle , scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the matrix @xmath29 can be thought of as an operator acting on @xmath27 by matrix and vector multiplication .",
    "it is not difficult to see that    @xmath30 ^ 2\\ ] ]    up to a constant , which we consider equal to one , formula @xmath31 is identical to the hamiltonian operator @xmath32 of a particle on a gravitational field introduced in @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can denote    @xmath33    however , we have described a completely combinatorial way to arrive at formula @xmath31 .",
    "it was done by considering graph theory concepts .",
    "it is natural to consider the random motion of a particle on the graph @xmath17 .",
    "the reason for this is that the matrix @xmath29 is related to this motion .",
    "define a random walk of a particle on @xmath17 as follows : a single particle located at vertex @xmath11 will move to a neighbour vertex @xmath12 with probability    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the colour of the edge which joins vertex @xmath11 to vertex @xmath12 , and the sum on the denominator is over all edges incident to @xmath11 .",
    "this random walk is known by simple random walk on @xmath17 .",
    "it can be seen that    @xmath36    the probabilities @xmath37 are called transition probabilities .",
    "we can associate a matrix @xmath38 to these given probabilities indexed by @xmath23 .",
    "this matrix is known as the transition matrix for this simple random walk .",
    "it is easy to see that this matrix satisfies    @xmath39    and that    @xmath40    where @xmath41 denotes the identity matrix .    in a random walk , the probability , @xmath42 , that the particle ends up at an arbitrary @xmath12 vertex , after a long period of time",
    "is given by    @xmath43    where we denote , @xmath44 .",
    "these probabilities mean that there is a vertex @xmath12 , where the particle is more likely to be found , whenever    @xmath45    for all the remaining vertices .",
    "it can be seen that the way we have defined the probability transitions and the probabilities @xmath42 , it is satisfied    @xmath46    the first equality is trivial . for the second one ,",
    "it is also easily verified since    @xmath47    these last equalities just tell us that the random walk we are considering is mathematically a specific class of a markov chain , see @xcite , @xcite for an introduction to markov chains .",
    "define the local entropy at each vertex @xmath12 by    @xmath48    this entropy is clearly maximised at a vertex when the number of edges incident to that particular vertex is large , and when they have equal weights .",
    "it is minimal when the weights associated to the edges incident to that vertex are all zero but one which could have any weight associated to it .",
    "the fact that the particle at random motion in the graph @xmath17 will tend to be localised at a vertex @xmath12 where @xmath42 is the largest number , does not necessarily imply that the entropy at that vertex @xmath49 is maximised . in order to have that property we have to consider a very particular graph case .",
    "we will consider the simplest of all cases .",
    "suppose the graph @xmath17 is such that it contains a vertex @xmath12 with a very large number @xmath50 of edges incident to it .",
    "moreover , suppose it is the vertex of largest valance .",
    "let all the weights of the edges incident to vertex @xmath12 be equal and large .",
    "then we have that @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , for all @xmath53 which labels the remaining vertices .",
    "this is the entropic motion we are defining .",
    "for particular cases the particle will move to a place where the entropy is the largest .",
    "this can be though of as an entropic motion .",
    "the particle will tend to increase its entropy by localising itself at the proper vertex .",
    "in this case we have that the particle starting at any vertex of the graph @xmath16 , will be move in the graph and be localised most probable at vertex @xmath12 . the local entropy in this case is simply given by    @xmath54",
    "imagine that the large number of edges incident to vertex @xmath12 are puncturing a spherical surface , like in an isolated black hole description of loop quantum gravity , see figure 4 .    , scaledwidth=60.0% ]    if we follow @xcite and suppose that the number of punctures is related to the spherical area by    @xmath55    we have that    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is a constant with no significance .",
    "let us mention one thing here .",
    "it is known that the entropy of a black hole of very large horizon area in loop quantum gravity has a logarithmic correction , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , given by @xmath58 .",
    "from this we can propose that the logarithmic correction to the entropy of a black hole in loop quantum gravity , may be due to the interaction of quantum space with a particle .",
    "now , let us consider the possibility of whether this entropic motion may reproduce gravitational entropic force as proposed in @xcite .",
    "in order to have an entropic force we need a temperature @xmath59 , and we also need to compute the change of entropy with respect to position . in our case as we have a discrete system given by the graph @xmath17 , we have that the variation of entropy with respect to position is just a difference of the local entropies at neighbour vertices .",
    "this means that the change of entropy at vertex @xmath12 where the particle is moving to , is given by    @xmath60    where @xmath11 is a neighbour vertex of @xmath11 .",
    "if we suppose that vertex @xmath11 has also a very large number of edges @xmath61 incident to it , such that @xmath61 is close to @xmath50 , and such that they have also equal weights , we will have that the difference @xmath62 is small .",
    "following again @xcite , we identify this small number with the mass @xmath53 of the particle    @xmath63    as the particle is most probably moving from vertex @xmath11 to vertex @xmath12 it must cross the imaginary spherical surface .",
    "again as in @xcite , we suppose the temperature of the surface is given by    @xmath64    which implies that    @xmath65    which may imply that the entropic motion we are defining in loop quantum gravity , reproduces newtonian gravity , as suggested in @xcite also .",
    "we have presented an idea of entropic motion and entropic force in loop quantum gravity . a toy model which could be strengthened and become an important issue in loop quantum gravity .",
    "any theory of quantum gravity is expected to reproduce general relativity in a semiclassical limit and of course newtonian gravity .",
    "loop quantum gravity has had difficulty when considering the semiclassical limit .",
    "however , important advances have been developed , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we expect to contribute in a fruitful way with the developed idea of this paper .",
    "for instance , we have seen that given a quantum gravity state , that is , a spin network @xmath16 , we can associate to it a new graph @xmath17 , representing a place where a particle moves in a random way . given a particle which moves randomly in the graph @xmath17 , it happens that there will be some places more visited than others from equation @xmath66 .",
    "and we have mentioned also , what the properties of these graphs should be in order for the random motion to be directed towards maximal local entropy .",
    "formula @xmath67 represents how the entropy varies according to position .",
    "this variation is proportional to the mass of the particle , according to @xcite .",
    "however , in the model we present , this variation may change from point to point and may imply a change in mass .",
    "if we want the mass to be preserved , we should propose formula @xmath67 to remain constant throughout the motion of the particle in the graph @xmath17 .",
    "what types of graphs @xmath17 , are the ones for which the random motion is directed towards an entropic one , that is , where entropy is maximised ? moreover , what should these graphs satisfy in order for equation @xmath67 remain constant throughout the motion of the particle ?",
    "we propose to investigate in this latter question .",
    "it may happen that the types of spin networks @xmath16 , which are associated to entropic motion in @xmath17 represent semiclassical states .",
    "it may not .",
    "but clearly this question may gives us some interesting information about loop quantum gravity .",
    "maybe generalising this toy model we have presented may help to prove more formally that loop quantum gravity really reproduces gravity in the semiclassical limit .",
    "* acknowledgements * i want to thank carlo rovelli for finding time to listen and discuss with me , some issues concerning the idea presented in this paper .",
    "i want to thank him also for his hospitality at the centre de physique theorique de luminy where this idea started ."
