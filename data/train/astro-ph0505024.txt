    "nearby starburst galaxies are fundamental testing grounds for key questions related to both star formation and galaxy evolution , as well as the interplay between galaxies and their surroundings .",
    "a detailed understanding of the properties of local starbursts is also critical to further examine star forming galaxies at high redshift , since the star formation rates of these distant , young galaxies are most similar to those found in local starbursts ( e.g. , steidel et  al .",
    "however , we are still learning about the stellar content and properties of local uv - bright starbursts .",
    "meurer et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) showed that nearby starbursts are irregular structures consisting of diffusely distributed light interspersed with prominent star clusters , including both compact objects ( with half - light radii @xmath3  pc ) , and more extended ob associations .",
    "they estimate that clusters only contribute @xmath4% of the light seen in ultraviolet images of starburst galaxies ( meurer et  al .",
    "1995 ; maoz et  al .",
    "thus the diffusely distributed light actually dominates the starburst , comprising roughly 80% of the total in the uv . to account for the observed `` bimodal '' nature of stellar populations in starbursts , meurer et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) suggested that two modes of star formation occur in high intensity bursts ",
    "prominent cluster formation and dominant diffusely distributed star formation .",
    "several explanations besides star formation occurring in a `` cluster '' mode and a `` field '' mode can explain the observed dichotomy of stellar properties in local starbursts .",
    "currently one popular scenario suggests that the diffuse uv field light is created via dissipation of aging star clusters , which contribute their remaining stars to the field .",
    "there are several works which indirectly support this scenario ( e.g. , tremonti et  al .",
    "2001 ; lada & lada 2003 ; fall , chandar , & whitmore 2004 ) .",
    "the stellar content of nearby starburst galaxies have been studied in more detail using multiband optical wfpc2 photometry .",
    "in addition to star clusters , color@xmath5magnitude diagram ( cmd ) analysis of the field star population suggests two distinct overall populations .",
    "greggio et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) and harris et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) find evidence that the resolved , diffuse stellar populations in ngc  1569 and m83 are older than the clusters .",
    "tremonti et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) compared uv spectroscopy of both resolved clusters and the diffuse field light in the nearby starburst ngc  5253 , with stellar evolutionary models .",
    "they established that the diffuse intra - cluster light in ngc  5253 has a spectrum lacking the strong o - star wind features which are clearly seen in a number of the cluster spectra in this galaxy .",
    "all of these observations are consistent with a scenario where the field is composed of dissolved star clusters .",
    "a possible counter - example , which supports the concept of stars forming early on in both clusters _ and _ in the field , is the tosi et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) study of ngc  1705 .",
    "they found that in order to reproduce the cmd of point sources in this post - starburst galaxy , a 23  myr _ field _ star population was required .",
    "however , other scenarios can also plausibly explain the presence of diffuse uv field light in starbursts .",
    "for example , continuous star formation in galaxies could result in a population of b  stars , which originally formed in clusters over the last few 100  myr , and dispersed throughout the galaxy once the clusters dissolved .",
    "a second possibility is that a fraction of uv photons originating in hot stars embedded in hii regions leak out and scatter off dust grains . in 30",
    "doradus , uit observations suggest that scattered light is the mechanism responsible for the uv field ( cheng et  al .",
    "1992 ) . in he  2 - 10 however ,",
    "a much more distant starburst , we were able to establish that scattered light can not be the dominant mechanism responsible for the observed uv field ( chandar et  al .",
    "barth et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) suggested a third possibility , that the diffuse light in nuclear starburst rings may be dominated by ( lower mass ) , unresolved star clusters .",
    "a fourth possible explanation is that individual massive stars may be forming in relative isolation in the field , as suggested for the nuclear regions of m51 ( lamers et  al .",
    "finally , in our recent work on the stellar content of he  2 - 10 , we established that both the clusters and intra - cluster regions show signatures of massive stars . from our detailed simulations",
    ", we suggest that the field population which formed coevally with the neighboring compact clusters ( @xmath645  myr ago ) may come from less spatially concentrated `` scaled ob assocations '' ( sobas ) , which are not lacking in the most massive stars , rather than faint , low mass coeval compact star clusters .",
    "is he  2 - 10 a unique case , where we are `` catching '' this galaxy early during a well coordinated burst ?",
    "do other galaxies have field stellar populations which appear older than those of neighboring clusters , such as found in ngc  5253 ? here we extend our previous studies of the diffuse intra - cluster light in local starbursts using longslit stis uv spectroscopy .",
    "ten galaxies from our _ hst _ program go-9036 have high enough s / n in the field to allow us to study their stellar composition .",
    "to these , we add the published results of he  2 - 10 and ngc  5253 for a more complete look at the nature of diffuse uv light in starburst galaxies .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : @xmath7 provides background information on the galaxy sample and describes the observations , basic data reduction , and definition of the field regions ; @xmath8 describes reduction and basic analysis of complementary archival wfpc2 images for three of the closest target galaxies ( ngc  4214 , ngc  4449 , and ngc  5253 ) ; @xmath9 derives the stellar content of the field by comparing with starburst99 models ; and @xmath10 takes advantage of spatial information as well as the spectra , in order to constrain the origin of the uv field light in our sample .",
    "finally , in @xmath11 we summarize the main conclusions of this work .",
    "our _ hst _ program , go-9036 , was designed to obtain a homogeneous far- and near- uv spectroscopic dataset of 18 nearby starburst galaxies .",
    "the target galaxies span a broad range of morphologies , chemical compositions , and luminosities .",
    "the primary targets in each galaxy were one to three luminous clusters ( either compact or giant h  ii regions ) ; however , the projected @xmath12 stis long - slit also covers fainter , serendipitous objects ( which could be stars or clusters ) , and regions of diffuse uv emission where no obvious sources are seen in available archival foc and wfpc2 images .",
    "the galaxy sample , distances , and area projected in the slit are compiled in table  [ table : sample ] .",
    "additional details for the galaxy sample and observations ( including slit locations ) are presented in the first paper in our series ( chandar et  al .",
    "2005a ; hereafter paper  i ) .",
    "analysis of the cluster content is the focus of the second paper ( chandar et  al .  2005b ; hereafter paper  ii ) . in this investigation , we analyse the diffuse uv emission seen between clusters in ten target galaxies .",
    "these are the galaxies where the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) of the extracted field spectrum is sufficiently high ( @xmath13 ) to quantify the dominant stellar population .",
    "to these we add the results of our previous work in he  2 - 10 ( chandar et  al .",
    "2003 ) and ngc  5253 ( tremonti et  al .",
    "2001 ) , for a comprehensive study of diffuse uv emission in 12 local starburst galaxies .      in order to combine multiple aligned exposures of the same target",
    ", we added together the flatfielded two - dimensional images ( there were no shifts between multiple galaxy spectra taken for go-9036 ) , updated the exposure time in the headers to reflect the total integration time , and reprocessed through the calstis pipeline .",
    "this pipeline rebins the spectra and provides a global detector linearity correction , dark subtraction , flat fielding , wavelength calibration and conversion to absolute flux units . for subsequent analysis on the field regions we utilized these",
    "fully calibrated rectified two dimensional images reprocessed through the calstis pipeline , which have a linear wavelength scale and uniform sampling in the spatial direction .",
    "further processing steps on the extracted one dimensional spectra included deredshifting ( values taken from ned ) and rebinning to the wavelength scale of the starburst99 models ( 0.75    @xmath14 ) utilized for comparison with the observations .",
    "we then corrected the extracted spectra for strong geocoronal emission at @xmath15 and oi @xmath16 by assuming that an outer portion from the two dimensional spectrum , which is typically located near the edge of the observable galaxy , represents a purely geocoronal spectrum near the @xmath15 and oi @xmath16 features . for each galaxy ,",
    "the spectrum extracted from near the end of the slit is typically at least @xmath17 weaker in continuum flux then the field regions , and displays very weak spectral features ( if they were observable at all ) , indicating that these are suitable for correcting geocoronal features .      in order to study the stellar content of the galaxies in our sample , we first detected objects ( which could be stars or clusters ) from profiles taken along the slit ( 700 columns were collapsed along the spatial direction ) .",
    "our detection procedure is analogous to those generally used for object detection in images .",
    "objects were defined as peaks along the spatial direction which reached a level at least five times higher than the standard deviation ( @xmath18 ) plus the local background level ( a second category , faint objects , which have 3@xmath19 detections are also studied in paper  ii ) .",
    "this technique ensures that we are detecting real sources and not random surface brightness fluctuations . in principle ,",
    "detected objects can be either stellar clusters or individual stars .",
    "however , individual stars should be considered as part of the diffuse uv population .",
    "therefore , it is very important to assess whether our object detection algorithm is detecting individual stars , since we do not want to exclude individual  o and/or b  stars from our definition of the field .",
    "based on the depth of our data and detection limits , the possibility of excluding individual massive stars is only a concern for the closest galaxies , those within @xmath65  mpc . because clusters dim as they age , the total luminosities of clusters and individual o / b supergiants can overlap , making it impractical to use a simple luminosity cut to separate stars and clusters .",
    "a further complication is that the narrow slit used in this study often does not include all of the light from an object , either because the object is extended , and/or because it is not centered in the slit .",
    "thus it is important to consider the _ total _ intrinsic luminosities of detected sources , and not just the light falling in the slit . to address this concern",
    ", we use a combination of object luminosities ( from paper  ii ) measured at 1500   , which are strict lower limits , and size information ( from profiles along the stis slit and sometimes available wfpc2 images ) to assess whether we are indeed detecting individual luminous stars .    here",
    "we use ngc  5253 as an example to examine the nature of detected sources , since the fuv spectrum for this galaxy is the deepest of the three closest targets .",
    "an o  supergiant has an intrinsic spectral luminosity density at 1500   , @xmath20 , of @xmath21 .",
    "this is similar to the light falling in the stis slit for the weakest detected objects ( see e.g. , objects  3 and 11 in tremonti et  al .",
    "however , the spatial profiles for these objects are clearly resolved ( as are the profiles for basically all detected objects in ngc  5253 and ngc  4214 , and most objects in ngc  4449 ) , and the slit location suggests that much of the flux from object  3 in ngc  5253 has been missed . in fact , a comparison of the total @xmath20 from available f170w wfpc2 images and stis spectroscopy ( see table  1 in tremonti et  al .",
    "2001 ) shows that for the four brightest sources , the @xmath20 flux measured from imaging where all of the light from an object is accessible , is higher by factors of 415 than the flux measured from stis spectroscopy .",
    "similar arguments apply for the objects detected in ngc  4214 and ngc  4449 .",
    "we conclude that the detected objects in galaxies closer than 5  mpc are not individual luminous stars , but stellar clusters or groups of stars . for",
    "more distant galaxies object fluxes are too high to come from individual stars .",
    "therefore , we will refer to detected sources in our stis spectra as clusters . in our analysis",
    ", we make an arbitrary distinction in each galaxy between bright clusters ( @xmath22 ) and faint clusters ( typically @xmath23 ) .",
    "these are discussed further in @xmath24 .",
    "we defined the field regions for each galaxy in two ways : ( 1 )  regions within @xmath25 of the local background , and ( 2 )  the entire galaxy minus the 13 targeted luminous clusters ( those used to determine the slit orientation ) .",
    "the spatial pixels defined as belonging to the field were then summed to give a one - dimensional field spectrum .",
    "note that in regions where the background changes rapidly along the slit , it can be difficult to determine the appropriate local level . to address this issue and any lingering concerns that our first definition eliminates small groups of individual o or b  stars from the extracted field , we analysed both extracted field spectra for each galaxy .",
    "we minimized contamination from luminous clusters by avoiding light from the wings of their profiles .",
    "spatial profiles , along with field regions according to our first definition are presented in figure  1 .",
    "note that a number of galaxies , particularly those with a large number of clusters in the slit ( e.g. , ngc  3310 and ngc  4449 ) , also have many `` bumps and wiggles '' in their field portions ( those within @xmath25 of the local background ) .",
    "in fact , in most galaxies , particularly those which are nearby , star clusters are not embedded in a smooth background of uv light .",
    "the field always shows some structure .",
    "is this structure due to variable reddening or discrete stellar populations ?",
    "in @xmath26 we discuss the results of measuring the spatial extent or size of numerous faint `` peaks '' visible in starburst field regions through our slits .",
    "we find in general that a significant fraction of these peaks are unresolved , and those which are resolved have sizes which are comparable to luminous clusters observed in each galaxy .",
    "additionally , we were able to match a few of the brighter peaks observed in the stis field regions with discrete , faint sources in deeper archival wfpc2 images .",
    "taken together , these points suggest that at least some of the faint peaks seen along the spatial direction are actually discrete stellar populations ( possibly a few stars or faint compact clusters ) , rather than variations in extinction or random fluctuations in the background level .",
    "we note that the precise locations defined as the `` field '' in each galaxy depend on a number of factors , such as total exposure time , galaxy distance , and local background levels .",
    "thus the `` field '' as we have defined it , is subject to a number of selection effects / biases .",
    "for example , deeper observations might allow for additional small bumps and wiggles in the spectrum to be added to the `` object '' list , as their s / n is increased .",
    "however , because we have collapsed a large number of pixels along the spatial direction , our definitions are somewhat robust against the depth of the observations .",
    "our definition of `` field '' is also distance dependent in the sense that we are unable to uniformly define a minimum object mass at a given age which is selected as a cluster .",
    "more distant galaxies are more likely to have higher mass clusters hiding in the field . if some of these clusters are very young , than we would expect the signature of massive stars in the extracted field spectra to increase with galaxy distance .",
    "potentially , some of the less massive objects that we have defined as clusters ( this only applies to galaxies closer than @xmath65  mpc ) may be random superpositions of several field o  stars , or possibly `` scaled ob associations '' or sobas ( hunter 1999 ) .",
    "our second extraction of the field , where we have only excised targeted clusters , allows us to directly probe this issue . in @xmath24",
    "we present results comparing the stellar content in the field and cluster spectra with instantaneous burst starburst99 models .",
    "although these models are not a good physical representation of the field , they do provide a simple way to quantify the massive star content .",
    "we found virtually no difference in the best fit ages , and hence in the massive star content , in our two definitions of the field for each galaxy .",
    "figure  1 shows the integrated 12501700    flux along the spatial direction of our longslit spectra .",
    "in addition to allowing us to define clusters / field portions , these spatial profiles give some insight into the stellar variations across each galaxy . in table  [ table : frac ] we present the total fraction of fuv light from star clusters observed in each pointing .",
    "we summed up light from clusters ( along the spatial direction ) and compared with the total light along the slit .",
    "the fraction of light in the field is assumed to be that not found in clusters .",
    "we derive values for the fraction of light in the field portions of local starburst galaxies ranging from roughly 25% to 70% .",
    "however , our slit locations targeted uv - bright clusters , and whenever possible orientations were chosen to maximize the number of such clusters in the slit .",
    "thus the particular locations observed in each galaxy are biased _ against _ the field .",
    "the field fractions presented in table  [ table : frac ] represent lower limits to the field contribution ( and an upper limit to the cluster contribution ) in the fuv , and are roughly consistent with the @xmath65080% field contribution derived by meurer et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) when considering nearby starbursts in their entirety .",

    ", there are five individual compact clusters on an elevated background at uv - optical wavelengths .",
    "the nature of this diffuse field light was investigated , and found to include a significant population of massive stars .",
    "this population could arise in a large number of lower mass compact clusters , or from diffuse sobas . because the density of putative lower mass clusters would have to be very large , we concluded that sobas formed coevally with the compact clusters were likely the main stellar contributor to the massive star - rich field .",

    "the field consists of a number of low level bumps and wiggles .",
    "to further constrain properties of the field regions studied in this work , we downloaded available archival wfpc2 images for our target galaxies .",
    "these allow the study of the stellar populations along the slit at different wavelengths , as well as providing a broader view of the stellar populations in our target galaxies , and not just the pointings targeted by our stis longslit spectra . because much of the available archival data is not very deep , or does not include observations in several filters , we restrict the wfpc2 image analysis to the three closest galaxies , ngc  4214 , ngc  4449 , and ngc  5253 , where individual stars can easily be detected , and the uv spectra are least subject to issues related to distance bias .",

    "we used a threshold of @xmath25 above the local background level , which upon visual inspection appeared to detect all obvious sources .",
    "in general , a detection which is the mean of the local background plus 3 times the standard deviation ( @xmath18 ) of this background , eliminates random surface brightness fluctuations , and leads to detection of actual objects .",
    "the f336w filter has a significant red leak , causing a fraction of an object s flux longward of 4000    to be detected in this filter .",
    "biretta et  al .",

    "however , there is a significant fraction of light outside this radius , which varies based on how extended an object is , and which directly impacts the total magnitude measurements . in order to measure aperture corrections for our sources , we first measured the sizes of all detected objects using larsen s ( 1999 ) ishape routine .",

    "we found that the size estimates from ishape using these two psfs differed by less than 20% .",

    "if lower mass , b - star dominated clusters are found in the field , we can not rule out the possibility that photons leaking out from these lower mass clusters are scattered , and thus produce the field uv light .",
    "regardless , the differences in spectral features observed between the field and clusters demonstrates that the uv emission in each environment originates in a _ different stellar population_.    how can our evidence that the diffuse uv light in starburst originates in a ( faint ) stellar population be reconciled with the claim that the diffuse inter - arm uv light in m101 is due to scattering off dust grains ?",
    "first , the geometry and distribution of dust in large spirals may differ substantially from that in dwarf systems such as those which often host starbursts .",
    "second , popescu et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) point out that even in the most extreme interarm regions discrete sources of uv emission are observed in full - resolution galex images . given the low - resolution of the galex images ( @xmath66  fwhm ) with respect to _ hst _ , it is plausible that some fraction of the diffuse inter - arm emission in m101 arises from a dispersed stellar population rather than from scattering due to dust .",
    "for example , the galex images are not sufficiently deep ( and do not have the spatial resolution ) to detect individual b  stars ( which are a plausible contributor to the diffuse uv field light ) . rather , these observations are appropriate for studying stellar complexes which have sizes of many tens to hundreds of parsecs at the distance of m101 .",

    "the main uncertainties in the values of @xmath48 come from the fact that a power law does not always provide a good fit to the data , mostly due to line blanketing in the spectra ( although we have excluded the most severely line blanketed spectral regions longward of 1640   )",

    "for example , a continuous star formation model with salpeter imf and upper mass cutoff of @xmath69 has an intrinsic slope , @xmath70 ( see @xmath43 for a discussion of continuous star formation models and their comparison with the data ) . because the dominant / youngest uv populations in the clusters are somewhat younger than those in the field ( as discussed in detail below )",

    "[ table : beta ] however , @xmath48 measurements for the field appear comparable to or bluer ( steeper ) for half ( 6/12 ) of the field spectra when compared with the composite cluster spectra in the same galaxy .",
    "because the spectral features in the uv allow us to precisely age - date the stellar populations in the clusters and the field , we know that the dominant stars in the field are generally older or less massive than those in the clusters . therefore one might expect that @xmath48 for the clusters would be bluer than for the field .",
    "however , our study establishes that the field is not _ categorically _ redder than young clusters in starbursts .",
    "a more likely explanation for the observed difference in slopes between clusters and the field is extinction variations between stellar populations residing in each environment , with the field showing less reddening . because the uv - bright clusters are quite young , it is likely that they still have at least some residual natal ism and dust surrounding them , leading to redder slope measurements .",
    "the bluer , less reddened slopes found in the field regions of some local starbursts when compared with star clusters have implications for the overall extinction estimates derived for high redshift galaxies .",
    "this is particularly important when uv spectra of whole high - z galaxies are compared with narrow - slit or small - aperture uv spectra of local star - forming galaxies .",
    "inferences of differences in stellar population compositions and/or extinction characteristics may stems from the fact that the uv spectrum of the local galaxy is only targeting one component ( e.g. , one cluster ) of the entire star forming region .",

    "this result holds for both field definitions , whether we are excluding all peaks above @xmath72 , or only excluding targeted , luminous star clusters .",

    "our main result from analysis of the stellar content of clusters and the field regions of starbursts is that the field generally shows weaker or absent p  cygni profiles compared with clusters .",
    "thus the fraction of high mass stars that are visible is smaller in the field than in the bright clusters .",
    "here we have simply showcased this result by presenting the best fit ages derived by comparing instantaneous burst evolutionary synthesis models with our extracted spectra .",

    "we again focus on the closest galaxies in our sample : ngc  4214 , ngc  4449 , and ngc  5253 all located within 4  mpc . for local peaks within the background which can be reasonably well isolated and do nt show obvious signs of being blends , we determined whether they were resolved or unresolved ( precise size estimates at these low s / n values would have large uncertainties ) .",
    "these three galaxies show fractions of _ resolved _ low level peaks in the field ( typically we found @xmath61317 such peaks per galaxy ) from @xmath87% to 60% . based on our measurement of the spatial profile of the star gd71 , unresolved objects have a fwhm @xmath64 . in the stis spatial cuts ,",
    "we consider a peak to be resolved if it has a fwhm measurement of @xmath88 or greater . at the distances of ngc  4214 , ngc  4449 , and",
    "ngc  5253 , this means that compact clusters with fwhm measurements smaller than @xmath89  pc would be considered unresolved .",
    "note that when compared with the brighter peaks which we have defined as clusters , a smaller relative fraction of the faint peaks in the field are resolved within a given galaxy .",
    "based on the field spectral signature , we know that these are not individual o  stars , although they are precisely in the flux range where we would expect to see individual o  stars included in our definition of the field .",
    "could we be seeing the continua from a dispersed b  star population ? to check if the observations are deep enough to detect the continua from individual b - stars , we first estimated the approximate detection limit for continua in ngc  4214 from the stis spectra ( few@xmath90  @xmath91 at 1500   ) , ngc  4449 ( few @xmath90  @xmath91 ) , and ngc  5253 ( @xmath92",
    "@xmath91 ) in our field regions .",
    "we then estimated the ( unreddened ) flux expected for a b0 supergiant at 1500   , assuming a temperature of 30,000  k , and a mass of @xmath93 from kurucz ( 1993 ) model atmospheres .",
    "we find that in the most optimistic scenario where a single b0 supergiant has no reddening , the flux would be just above our detection limit .",
    "however , this scenario is not very likely , since lower mass b  stars are much more numerous than b0 stars , and because it is unlikely that such stars have no reddening , as demonstrated for example , by a comparison of spectral type and observed color for b  stars in the humphreys ( 1978 ) catalog .",
    "therefore , we conclude that while some of the weaker unresolved peaks in our field spectra could be the continua from individual early b  supergiants , it is unlikely that all of the unresolved peaks come from individual b  stars .",
    "this does not however preclude a population of dispersed b  stars from contributing to the continuum level observed in our uv spectroscopy of the field .    because our calculations suggest that individual b  stars are not responsible for all of the individual faint peaks seen in the field portions of our stis spectra , it is likely that at least some of the unresolved peaks which we observe in the field regions of these local starbursts are either chance superpositions of b  stars , or compact star clusters .",
    "the question then becomes are these young , low mass clusters , or older more massive but faded clusters .",
    "we can also use our photometry to help place limits on the properties of star clusters contributing to our stis spectra , since it is possible to match individual sources seen in archival @xmath28  band wfpc2 images with the objects in our slit .",
    "if we restrict the object samples in the wfpc2 images to those within 50  pc of the stis slit , we set approximate detection limits @xmath94 for ngc  4214 , ngc  4449 , and ngc  5253 respectively , from available wfpc2 imaging .",
    "a comparison of the @xmath77 vs.  @xmath78 colors of resolved objects to the stellar evolutionary models of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) suggests that these sources are almost exclusively young , with likely ages of several myr ( although ages derived from integrated photometry , particularly for such low mass clusters , are subject to relatively large uncertainties ) . by scaling the luminosity of a 7  myr star cluster of @xmath95 ( @xmath96 according to starburst99 models ) , we find that any young clusters which are not observed in the archival wfpc2 images would have masses of several hundred solar masses and less ( i.e. @xmath97 ) .",
    "we note that this is similar to the lowest mass star cluster detected by tremonti et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) in their study of ngc  5253 using stis long - slit spectroscopy .",
    "older clusters at similar luminosities could also contribute to the field , and would be more massive . in @xmath98 5.5.3 and 5.5.4 ,",
    "we explore in turn the possibilities that young , low mass clusters and older , dissolving / fading clusters contribute to our observed field regions .",
    "our main result is that the diffuse uv light in starbursts lacks the strong o - star wind features observed in neighboring uv - bright star clusters . in this section ,",
    "we explore four possible scenarios which can explain this result :    * star formation occurs in both clusters and the field , but the most massive stars in the field remain in the deeply enshrouded phase longer , and thus to do not contribute to the uv flux .",
    "* star formation occurs in both the field and clusters , but there is little or no high mass star formation occuring in the field .",
    "this hypothesis requires that stars formed in clusters and the field have different imfs .",
    "* star formation occurs primarily in clusters , and what we are calling the field is composed of young , but lower mass clusters ( the low mass end of the powerlaw cluster mass function ) , which do not form o stars . * star formation occurs primarily in clusters , and as clusters age they dissolve , releasing their remaining stars into the field .    in  5.5.15.5.4 below , we discuss each scenario in turn including general implications for field formation .",
    "one scenario which could explain the observed difference in massive star signatures between clusters and the field is the possibility that star formation occurs in both environments , but that field o  stars remain obscured ( at uv wavelengths ) on timescales comparable to their lifetimes , and thus longer than similar stars in clusters .",
    "there are two mechanisms which influence when a massive star becomes visible at optical / uv wavelengths : ( 1 )  radiation and winds from massive stars blow out the parent molecular cloud , and ( 2 )  ob associations tend to drift away from their parent clouds , since stars and gas experience different rates of friction , and thus have different velocities . in order to reproduce both the wind features and continuum slopes observed in clusters and field spectra ,",
    "individual o  stars formed in the field can neither blow off their natal material nor drift away from their parent cloud on timescales of @xmath667  myr , otherwise their signature would be observed in our field spectra .",
    "this restriction would not apply to o  stars formed in clusters . the typical travel time , although quite uncertain , has been given as 13  myr ( de jong & brink 1986 ; leisawitz & hauser 1988 ) .",
    "the problem with this scenario is that it requires fine - tuning of both drift and blow out timescales for field o  stars , which must in turn be longer than those for similar stars formed in clusters .",
    "therefore , we conclude that it is unlikely that deeply embedded , individual o  stars are forming in the field regions of these starbursts , and we have just missed them because little uv flux can escape .      if star formation is occuring in both field and clusters , the lack of massive stars observed in the field could arise if the imf differs from that in clusters .",
    "we found in @xmath24 that instantaneous burst starburst99 models older than 68  myr produce reasonably good fits to the field spectra .",
    "however , these are unlikely to be realistic representations of spatially extended field regions . because these field regions cover a minimum linear distance of @xmath6100  pc , it is unlikely that all the stars formed at the same time . here",
    ", we compare continuous star formation models with the extracted field spectra and discuss implications .",
    "these models take @xmath610  myr to equilibrate , after which the fuv spectrum changes very little as a function of age .",
    "therefore , we fix the age at 50  myr , and assume a standard salpeter imf ( slope @xmath99 ) , and lower mass cutoff @xmath75 ( the results of our uv spectroscopy are rather insensitive to the lower mass cutoff to the imf ) .",
    "there are two possible scenarios which can explain the lack of massive stars observed in field regions ; both assume implicitly that star formation is occurring _ in situ _ in the field . in the first set of models , we fix the age of the continuous star formation episode at 50  myr , assume a salpeter imf , and determine whether our field spectra are consistent with an upper mass cutoff which differs from that for clusters .",
    "the second set of continuous star formation models fits for the best imf slope , with an upper mass cutoff of @xmath47 .    for the first set of models where we fit for the upper stellar mass cutoff , we have recorded the best fit in column  2 of table  [ table : field ] .",
    "qualitatively , the lack of massive stars which is expressed by older ages when comparing with instantaneous burst models , translates to upper mass cutoffs lower than @xmath47 .",
    "the effect of varying the upper mass cutoff is shown in the second column of plots in figure  3 .",
    "clearly , as the upper mass cutoff is lowered from @xmath47 , the signature of massive stars , particularly the p  cygni profiles for n  v  @xmath39 , si  iv  @xmath40 , and c  iv  @xmath41 , disappears . in order to reproduce the observed field spectra ,",
    "the upper stellar mass cutoff in these models has to be lowered from the @xmath47 used in the instantaneous burst models , and which provides a good fit for the clusters . for the field spectra in most target galaxies , particularly in the nearest galaxies and those distant ones which",
    "also do not show the signature of massive star wind lines , the preferred upper mass cutoff is 30@xmath2 .",
    "a second possibility is that the imf of stars formed in the field is steeper than those forming in clusters .",
    "for example , massey et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) find field stars as massive as those formed in clusters and associations in the magellanic clouds , even after ensuring that runaway stars are excluded .",
    "we tested this possibility by comparing a continuous starburst99 model fixed at an age of 50  myr , with lower and upper mass cutoffs of @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively , and allowed the slope of the imf , @xmath100 , to vary between a normal salpeter value of @xmath101 and the @xmath102 found by massey et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) for the field in portions of the magellanic clouds .",
    "the most important influence of the massive stars is seen in the wind lines , and so we only weighted n  v  @xmath39 , si  iv  @xmath40 , and c  iv  @xmath41 in our fits .",
    "in the third column of plots in figure  3 note in particular the rapidly decreasing strength in the n  v  @xmath39 line .",
    "we find in general that the preferred value of @xmath100 is between @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "this is steeper than salpeter , but not as steep as found for the magellanic clouds .",
    "comparison of our extracted field regions with continuous star formation models rule out an imf slope as steep as @xmath105 for our galaxies . due to the possibility that our extracted field regions include star clusters , and hence some additional massive stars which would result in a flatter slope , our values of @xmath100 represent a firm lower limit to the field imf slope .",
    "therefore , if star formation is occuring _ in situ _ in the field , and not as a result of dissolving or aging star clusters , the field is much less likely to produce massive stars than the cluster environment .",
    "the ultraviolet emission from the field regions surrounding star clusters in our target starbursts , in all cases with the exception of he  2 - 10 , lacks the strong o - star wind lines of n  v , si  iv , and c  iv that are signatures of the most massive stars .",
    "this lack of high mass stars is not due to undersampling field regions in nearby starbursts , as the field regions contain a considerable amount of light .",
    "if we reject that the imf slope and upper stellar mass cutoff of field regions differs from that found in clusters , there are two remaining possibilities which can explain both the observed spectral signature of the uv field and the strength of the faint peaks in the field regions .",
    "one possibility is that the field is composed of clusters which are coeval with those observed in our slit , but have lower masses .",
    "the second is that the field is made up of older / dissolving star clusters .",
    "the difference in these two scenarios is primary one of _",
    "although galaxies almost certainly form clusters with a range in both age and mass , for simplicity , we assume here that the presumed population formed coevally with the luminous clusters .",
    "these clusters would represent the lower extension of the observed powerlaw cluster luminosity function ( see e.g. , whitmore et  al .",
    "2003 and references therein ) .",
    "we determined in the previous section that clusters with ages of several myr and masses of several hundred solar masses would not have sufficient s / n to be classified as clusters in our spectra , even in galaxies closer than 4  mpc . furthermore , despite their youth , it is reasonable to expect that such low mass clusters may be lacking in the most massive o  stars , yet still be able to form b  stars .",
    "there are two current arguments regarding how the upper mass portion of the stellar imf is populated in lower mass clusters .",
    "the first suggests that the distribution of stellar masses is a random sampling of the initial stellar mass function , which naturally would result in the formation of very few massive o  stars in lower mass clusters .",
    "for example , a recent study by oey , king , & parker ( 2004 ) of the number of ob stars per cluster or association ( @xmath106 ) in the small magellanic cloud , concludes that the distribution of @xmath106 is consistent with these being the most massive stars in groups of lower mass stars .",
    "the second argument ( e.g. , weidner & kroupa 2004 ) suggests that there is a fundamental upper stellar mass limit which depends on the total mass of a cluster . from their figure  4",
    ", a cluster at the detection limit of our study would have an upper _ stellar _ mass limit of @xmath107 .",
    "we performed a simple experiment to investigate whether stars with masses @xmath108 ( @xmath6o  stars ) are likely to form in clusters with masses of a few  100@xmath109 .",
    "we randomly drew stars with masses between @xmath110 and @xmath47 , from a distribution having a salpeter slope ( @xmath101 ) . out of 1000 such simulated clusters ,",
    "roughly 200300 had at least one star more massive than @xmath111 . therefore ,",
    "if young , lower mass clusters dominate the diffuse uv light , our limits imply that there must be a sliding upper stellar mass limit , which is related to the total mass of the cluster , as suggested by weidner & kroupa ( 2004 ) .      because the field regions of starbursts contain less massive stars than the clusters , a fourth possibility that the main difference between the cluster and field stellar populations is truly one of age .",
    "the field could be composed of stars which originally formed in clusters , but which dissolved and released their remaining stars to the field . _",
    "if _ the field is the product of dissolving star clusters , than we can place constraints on the timescales that clusters in these starbursts must disintegrate . based on the youngest and dominant ages of the field compiled in table  [ table : ages ] when compared with those for star clusters , we suggest that clusters which contribute to the field need to be destroyed on very rapid timescales , of order 710  myr .",
    "the evolution of cluster systems in general includes a number of disruptive processes , such as mass loss from stellar evolution , and stellar evaporation due to external gravitational shocks and internal two - body relaxation ( e.g. , fall & zhang 2001 ) .",
    "however , these mechanisms occur over relatively long timescales ( @xmath112  yrs ) when compared with the 710  myr estimated above",
    ". a recent study of the age distribution of star clusters in the antennae galaxies suggests a very rapid decline . fall ( 2004 ) and",
    "fall , chandar , & whitmore ( 2004 ) find that the number of clusters as a function of age falls by a factor @xmath610 by the time the cluster population has reached an age of 10  myr .",
    "this rapid decline is seen for different mass ranges above @xmath113 .",
    "number counts of embedded clusters in the solar neighborhood with masses lower by factors 10@xmath114 also show a similar steep decline ( lada & lada 2003 ) .",
    "fall et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) suggest that this short disruption timescale indicates that the majority of ( but not all ) star clusters in the antennae end up gravitationally unbound , even if the cloud from which they initially formed was initially bound .",
    "the ionizing radiation , stellar winds , and supernovae explosions from massive stars could easily remove a significant fraction of the ism from a protocluster , leaving the stars within it gravitationally unbound and freely expanding .",
    "if this is the case , such clusters would become very difficult to detect after @xmath610  myr .",
    "the very short timescales for cluster dissolution inferred from our data in local starburst galaxies , _ if _ dissolving clusters are responsible for the diffuse uv field emission , are consistent with the timescales of cluster disruption predicted by the free expansion model .",
    "the advantage of using uv spectroscopy , as we have done here , is the ability to track the presence of the most massive stars , and directly translate these into age differences between clusters and the field .",
    "the differences observed in the field and cluster spectra of our galaxy sample have potentially important implications for the rest - uv observations of galaxies at high redshift .",
    "because of their small angular extent , entire galaxies are observed at high redshift , while the best local counterparts are studied in a more piecemeal way .",
    "because the diffuse uv light from starbursts typically dominates the output from stellar clusters , it is very important to include this as an ingredient in spectral synthesis of galaxies at high redshift ( although steidel et  al .",
    "1996 show that a comparison of @xmath115 lyman break galaxy spectra with those of individual local clusters also give reasonable fits ) .",
    "we have combined the extracted field spectra for five metal - poor galaxies ( mkn33 , ngc  4214 , ngc  4449 , ngc  4670 , and ngc  5253 ) which do not show the signature of massive stars , in order to make a high s / n template of a low metallicity `` field '' spectrum ( figure  6 ) .",
    "typical abundances for the galaxies are @xmath61/31/5 solar , which is a good match to abundances measured for high redshift galaxies ( pettini et  al .  2000 ) .",
    "this has a characteristic spectrum which is `` older '' than individual clusters ( i.e.  lacking the signature of massive stars ) , and is well represented by continuous star formation models .",
    "we have used stis long - slit fuv spectra of twelve local starburst galaxies to study the stellar content of the diffuse , uv luminous field regions found between prominent star clusters .",
    "the extracted spectra are compared with starburst99 stellar evolutionary synthesis models .",
    "he  2 - 10 is unique to our study , in that it contains the signature of massive o  stars in the field regions .",
    "the composite field spectrum is very similar to that for four coeval clusters in our slit .",
    "we estimate that 40% of the light in the far uv comes from observed compact star clusters , providing a firm lower limit to the amount of uv light originating in clusters in this starburst .    with the exception of he  2 - 10 , the clusters and field regions in the other 11 target galaxies exhibit pronounced differences .",
    "most of the uv - bright clusters are quite young ( @xmath116  myr ) , and show the strong p  cygni profiles found in o stars .",
    "the neighboring field regions however , clearly lack these wind features . in particular , the nearest galaxies ( ngc  4214 , ngc  4449 , and ngc  5253 ) , as well as a number of more distant ones , have b - star dominated field spectra .    we include an analysis of _ uvi _ wfpc2 imaging for these three closest galaxies , in order to better understand the stellar populations which contribute to the field .",
    "photometry of observed sources in all three galaxies reveals populations of blue resolved and unresolved sources .",
    "the colors and luminosities of resolved objects are indistinguishable from those of unresolved sources .",
    "this suggests the presence of low mass , resolved star clusters , as well as a dispersed population of blue stars .",
    "because we see no evidence for the presence of o  stars in the field regions of these galaxies based on our ( limited coverage ) stis spectroscopy , we suggest that these are a dispersed population of b  stars .",
    "the spatial profiles along the slit show that the field regions are not smooth , but rather contain numerous faint peaks and valleys .",
    "an analysis of the faint peaks in the field regions of our stis spectra suggests that these arise from discrete stellar populations .",
    "roughly 3060% of these peaks are resolved .",
    "our calculations show however , that the stis spectra are just sufficient to detect the continua from unreddened , individual early b  supergiants in the field . therefore , while the population of dispersed b  stars discovered in the archival wfpc2 images probably do contribute to the field spectra , they are probably not responsible for all of the faint peaks we observe .",
    "we conclude that a significant fraction of these faint peaks are likely small groups or clusters of stars , regardless of whether they are resolved or not .",
    "\\(1 ) if star formation occurs _ in situ _ in both clusters and the field , and o  stars formed in the field stay in the enshrouded phase longer than their counterparts in clusters , then these stars would not contribute much to the field uv flux .",
    "this scenario would require a `` fine - tuning '' of both secular drift velocities and blow - out timescales for field o  stars .",
    "therefore we believe that it is unlikely that deeply embedded , individual o  stars are forming in the field regions of starbursts .",
    "\\(2 ) if star formation occurs in both field and cluster environments , the field imf must differ from that found in clusters .",
    "if the field imf has a normal salpeter slope , our data are consistent with an upper mass cutoff of 3050  @xmath117 . alternatively , the field imf slope , @xmath100 , is steeper than salpeter , with best fit values of @xmath103 to @xmath104 .",
    "\\(3 ) if star formation is occuring primarily in clusters and associations , then the field could be composed of young , coeval but lower mass clusters .",
    "our photometry and spectroscopy both imply limits of several @xmath47 for groups or clusters of young stars which could be hiding in our field spectra .",
    "this limit is consistent with a lack of o  stars only _ if _ there is an upper stellar mass limit which scales with the total cluster mass .",
    "so effectively , this is similar to scenario  ( 2 ) .",
    "\\(4 ) if star formation occurs primarily in clusters , but these clusters dissolve to create the observed field , our analysis suggests that clusters must dissolve on very rapid timescales , of order 710  myr .",

    "<S> we investigate the nature of the diffuse intra - cluster ultraviolet light seen in twelve local starburst galaxies , using long - slit ultraviolet spectroscopy obtained with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) aboard the _ hubble space telescope _ </S>",
    "<S> ( _ hst _ ) . </S>",
    "<S> we take this faint intra - cluster light to be the field in each galaxy , and compare its spectroscopic signature with starburst99 evolutionary synthesis models and with neighboring star clusters . </S>",
    "<S> our main result is that the diffuse ultraviolet light in eleven of the twelve starbursts lacks the strong o - star wind features that are clearly visible in spectra of luminous clusters in the same galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the difference in stellar features dominating cluster and field spectra indicate that the field light originates primarily from a different stellar population , and not from scattering of uv photons leaking out of the massive clusters . </S>",
    "<S> a cut along the spatial direction of the uv spectra establishes that the field light is not smooth , but rather shows numerous `` bumps and wiggles . '' </S>",
    "<S> roughly 3060% of these faint peaks seen in field regions of the closest ( @xmath0  mpc ) starbursts appear to be resolved , suggesting a contribution from superpositions of stars and/or faint star clusters . </S>",
    "<S> complementary wfpc2 _ uvi _ imaging for the three nearest target galaxies , ngc  4214 , ngc  4449 , and ngc  5253 are used to obtain a broader picture , and establish that all three galaxies have a dispersed population of unresolved , luminous blue sources . because the field spectra are dominated by b stars </S>",
    "<S> , we suggest that the individual sources observed in the wfpc2 images are individual b  stars ( rather than o  stars ) , or small star clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we consider several scenarios to understand the lack of observed massive stars in the field , and their implications for the origin of the field stellar population . </S>",
    "<S> if the field stellar populations formed _ in situ _ , the field must either have an imf which is steeper than salpeter ( @xmath1 ) , or a salpeter slope with an upper mass cutoff of 30@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> if star formation occurs primarily in star clusters , the field could be composed of older , faded clusters , and/or a population which is coeval with the luminous clusters but lower in mass . </S>",
    "<S> we use these benchmark populations to place constraints on the field stellar population origin . </S>",
    "<S> although the field probably includes stars of different ages , the uv light is dominated by the youngest stellar populations in the field . </S>",
    "<S> if the field is composed of older , dissolving clusters , we estimate that star clusters ( regardless of mass ) need to dissolve on timescales 710  myr to create the field . </S>",
    "<S> if the field is composed of young clusters which fall below the detection limit of individual sources in our spectroscopy , they would have to be several hundred solar masses or less , in order to be deficient in o stars , despite their extreme youth . </S>"
