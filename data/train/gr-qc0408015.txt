    "in relativistic astrophysics and pure general relativity the concept of  phase transition \" is usually associated with very different scenarios . in general relativity",
    "we have the spherically symmetric collapse of a massless scalar field or yang - mills field that leads to a formation of a black hole @xcite . in the astrophysical context",
    "we have first order phase transition in neutron star models , where we found matter condensation from neutron matter to pion - condensed matter and quark matter @xcite .",
    "also we can have a phase transitions in the core of a rotating neutron star @xcite . in the last few years",
    ", the phase transition phenomenon have become important in relativistic astrophysics since we can have emission of gravitational waves @xcite associated to this transition .",
    "observational evidence of this phenomenon can be attained @xcite with the present laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ) .",
    "the ligo - i maximum distance for detection of gravitational waves is about 6.4 mpc , well beyond the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) , whereas the next generation ligo - ii detectors will probably see phase transition events at distances two times longer @xcite .",
    "the model studied in this work is indirectly related to the topics mention above .",
    "our aim is to study the behavior of the thermodynamic properties and the space - time structure in a simple albeit important astrophysical object , a self - gravitating ball of fluid performing a generic first order phase transition . in particular , the riemann - christoffel curvature tensor is study in some detail for the space - time associated the different regions of the matter that presents a first order phase transition .    to model this system in the context of general relativity",
    ", we used the tov equations ( tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ) @xcite .",
    "the tov equations represent the einstein field equations for a stationary , spherical symmetric system with a perfect fluid energy momentum tensor and a local equation of state .",
    "the most simple and general equation of state to model a phase transition in a classical system of particles , is the van der walls equation of state together with the maxwell energy balance construction .",
    "the maxwell energy balance construction have been studied in a rigorous treatment in systems with two - body interaction potential proving the equal - area rule at the transition region in the equation of state @xcite .",
    "also the non analyticity of the van der walls equation of state together with the maxwell energy balance construction appears to be generic for first order phase transitions originated in microscopic short range forces @xcite .    to solve the tov equations one needs a smooth equation of state . in order to overcame the fact that in a first order phase transition we will have a non analytic equation of state we shall perform several smoothing interpolations . afterward we show that the real situation can be obtained as a limit that is independent of the used interpolations .",
    "the article is organized as follows , in section [ two ] we present the basic equations that model our system , in particular we study the tov equations and present a van der walls like equation of state that models a phase transition . in section",
    "[ three ] , we analyze the special case of constant pressure .",
    "this case needs to be treated in a different form because , strictly , the tov equations are not valid in this case . in section",
    "[ four ] , we present the behavior of the thermodynamic variables , the metric components , the kretschmann curvature invariant and the components of the riemann - christoffel curvature tensor inside the star undergoing a phase transition . finally , in section [ five ] we summarized our results .",
    "we consider a static spherical symmetric space - time described by the line element    @xmath0    where @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the matter is represented by the perfect fluid energy momentum tensor    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the energy density , @xmath5 is the four - velocity , @xmath6 is the speed of light , and @xmath7 the pressure measured in the local rest frame .",
    "we also assume that the pressure and the energy density are related by an equation of state of the form @xmath8 .    the einstein field equations ,    @xmath9    where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the gravitational constant , can be written with the help of ( [ eq : ds2 ] ) and ( [ eq : talfabeta ] ) as a set of three equations ,    @xmath12 = -\\zeta   \\left ( \\frac{\\rho } { 2}+\\frac{3}{2 } \\frac{p}{c^{2}}\\right ) , \\nonumber \\\\ & & e^{-\\lambda } \\left [ \\frac{1}{2}\\nu ^{{\\prime}{\\prime } } -\\frac{1}{4}\\lambda ^{{\\prime}}\\nu ^{{\\prime}}+\\frac{1}{4 } ( \\nu ^ { { \\prime } } ) ^{2}-\\frac{1}{r}\\lambda ^{{\\prime}}\\right ] = -\\zeta   \\left ( \\frac{\\rho } { 2}-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{p}{c^{2}}\\right ) , \\nonumber \\\\ & & e^{-\\lambda } \\left [ \\frac{1}{r^{2}}+\\frac{1}{2r } (   \\nu^{{\\prime}}-\\lambda ^{{\\prime } } ) \\right ] -\\frac{1}{r^{2}}=-\\zeta   \\left ( \\frac{\\rho } { 2}-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{p}{c^{2}}\\right ) ,   \\label{eq:14.12a } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in which @xmath13 denotes differentiation with respect to the coordinate @xmath14 .",
    "to write the equations above in a simpler form we use the function @xmath15 defined by ,    @xmath16    @xmath17 is the geometric mass which has dimensions of distance and @xmath18 is the quantity of mass inside a sphere of radius @xmath14 . with this change of variable",
    ", we obtain the system of equations known as the tov equations ,    @xmath19    the first three equations allow us to solve for the geometric mass @xmath15 , the pressure @xmath20 , and the energy density @xmath21 , i.e. the thermodynamic quantities of the system .",
    "the last two equations define the space - time geometry through the functions @xmath22 and @xmath23 present in the metric .",
    "the equation of state ( [ eq : e1 ] ) depends on the particle interactions of the system .",
    "an equation of state that allows a phase transition is a van der walls like equation of state of the the form ,    @xmath24    where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are characteristic parameters of a particular physical system . to solve the tov equations using the equation of state ( [ eq : pvdw ] ) , we have to specify the type of particle considered through the parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "using the law of the corresponding states is possible to obtain an equation of state which is independent of these parameters , in other words , valid for any  real gas \" .",
    "this equation of state in the so called reduce quantities ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) is    @xmath30    with @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 defined by the adimensional relations    @xmath34    where @xmath35 are the values of the pressure , energy density and temperature in which the first and second derivative of ( [ eq : vander ] ) become zero simultaneously .",
    "also @xmath36 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : eevw ] we show a typical van der walls like isothermal for a system in phase transition ( gas - liquid ) in reduce coordinates .",
    "we know that the van der walls like equation of state describes well the regions of gas and liquid but in the region of coexistence it presents physical inconsistencies , e.g. in the transition region we do not have dynamical equilibrium between the phases .",
    "therefore , we modify the equation of state ( [ eq : vander ] ) using the maxwell energy balance construction @xcite .",
    "the maxwell energy balance construction allows us to calculate the pressure of coexistence @xmath37 and the coexistence energy density interval [ @xmath38 through the system of equations ,    @xmath39    first we fix a temperature value @xmath28 and then we solve the system of equations ( [ eq : qq1 ] ) ( e.g. with the newton - raphson method for nonlinear systems ) .",
    "once @xmath37 is found , we can say that the state equations for our system in phase transition between gas and liquid is of the form ,    @xmath40    we note that the equation of state ( [ eq : p(r ) ] ) is not of class @xmath41 because its derivatives have discontinuities in @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "so , the tov equations can not be solved around these energy densities .",
    "furthermore , in the coexistence region , the equation of state satisfies the equation @xmath44 that brings no physical solutions , e.g. negative masses , see equation ( [ eq : e3 ] ) .",
    "for this reason , the case of constant pressure has to be study independently .",
    "the problem of smoothness above mentioned can be solved using an equation of state of class @xmath41 or smoother instead of ( [ eq : p(r ) ] ) .",
    "this is done redefining the equation of state ( [ eq : p(r ) ] ) in the region of coexistence using a virial like equation to make , at least , the joints in @xmath45 and @xmath46 of class @xmath41 .",
    "the line @xmath47 in the coexistence region can be approximated by a straight line with a small slope angle ( @xmath48 ) . in this way ,",
    "our equation of state for the system becomes    @xmath49    where @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 are constants to be determined , and @xmath53 is the interval for the coupling polynomials . in our case we define the coefficients @xmath51 so that the straight line pass through the point @xmath37 at the middle of the interval [ @xmath54 , in this way    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is directly associated with the angle @xmath48 [ @xmath57 ) ] of the straight line in the transition region .",
    "the polynomial coefficients @xmath50 and @xmath52 are calculated using the six boundary conditions given by the continuity of the pressure , its first derivative , and its second derivatives at the junctions .",
    "we found that our @xmath41 class curve defined in this way is a good approximation for the case of a gas - liquid transition .",
    "the analysis of the case with @xmath58 will be discussed in section [ three ] .",
    "for generality sake , we want that the system of equations ( [ eq : e1]-[eq : e5 ] ) be independent on the characteristic parameters of the gas .",
    "we introduce new variables @xmath59 and @xmath60 define as    @xmath61    where the quantity @xmath62 is a scale factor .",
    "furthermore we fix our units by choosing    @xmath63    substituting these expressions in equations ( [ eq : e1 ] ) , ( [ eq : e2 ] ) and ( [ eq : e3 ] ) , the internal structure of the star undergoing a phase transition is found solving the system of equations    @xmath64   \\left [ 3\\rho_r+p_r\\right ]   \\left [ \\frac{\\partial p_r}{\\partial \\rho_r } \\right ] ^{-1 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\frac{\\partial \\widehat{f } } { \\partial \\,\\,\\widehat{r}}= \\rho_r",
    "-2\\frac{\\widehat{f } } { \\widehat{r } } , \\label{eq : sis}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where for each region of the star we have to use the isothermal corresponding to the temperature that allows a phase transition .",
    "to perform the integration of the tov equations through the discontinuities of the coexistence region , we use the class @xmath41 equation of state ( 16 ) with the constants of the coupling polynomials calculated using the six boundary conditions mentioned in section [ two ] .",
    "the coexistence region is modeled , in first approximation , by a straight line with a small slope angle ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "then we let the angle @xmath48 go to zero to assure that the abrupt change presented in the energy density figure ( and other figures that depend on the energy density ) are indeed vertical lines .",
    "the same result can be obtained in a different way . knowing the pressure and energy densities interval for the coexistence region ( e. g. , from the maxwell construction ) one can solved the tov equation independently for the liquid phase as well as for and gas phase",
    ". then the end points are joit with a straight line . with this second method",
    "we never integrate the tov equations through the discontinuities .",
    "both methods give the same results , we use the first one because in our opinion the results appear in a more transparent way .    to determine the behavior of the energy density in the coexistence region and the radial interval in which the transition occurs in the limit @xmath66",
    ", we define a straight line passing through the points @xmath67 and @xmath68 , where we see that for a small @xmath69 [ @xmath70 a good approximation of the line @xmath71 is found .",
    "we choose arbitrary values for the energy density interval @xmath72 and pressure @xmath73 , with these values the equation of state in the coexistence region is of the form ,    @xmath74    when @xmath75 we obtain the case of constant pressure @xmath76 . in figure",
    "[ fig : rocon ] we solved numerically the tov equations ( [ eq : sis ] ) with the equation of state ( [ eq : pconstante ] ) for different values of @xmath69 . in the limit @xmath75 we can affirm that the transition occurs only in a concentric spherical surface of the star .",
    "this means that in the limit of @xmath77 for a given equation of state of the type ( [ smootheqst ] ) with ( [ eq : pconstante ] ) , the tov system brings us a solution of a star model that consists in a foliation of spherical , isobaric , and acronal surfaces .",
    "this is in accordance with the stationary hypothesis made for the model , because if the transition take place in a radial interval instead of a fixed radius , the different gravitational forces at different radius will make a non stationary system .",
    "for didactic purposes we choose the isothermal with reduced temperature @xmath78 and parameters ( @xmath79 , @xmath80 ) to study the thermodynamic properties and the space - time behavior .",
    "it can be verified that all the isotherms that allow a phase transition have the same qualitative behavior . with the values of the coexistence pressure @xmath81 and",
    "the energy density coexistence interval @xmath82 found from ( [ eq : qq1 ] ) , we can solve numerically the system of equations ( [ eq : sis ] ) .",
    "the inner boundary condition can be set recalling that @xmath15 is proportional to the mass inside the sphere of radius @xmath14 , @xmath83 .",
    "so , the inner boundary condition for the new variables are @xmath84 ; which represent a liquid core of high energy density , the value @xmath85 is set arbitrarily . in figure",
    "[ fig : d(r ) ] , we show the numerical solution of the tov equations for the thermodynamic quantities in the star with phase transition .",
    "the phase transition shows up like a suddenly brake in the energy density at @xmath86 .",
    "looking at the energy density plot we can think the high dense region with @xmath87 as a liquid core and the region with small density @xmath88 as a gas mantle .",
    "the pressure has a discontinuity in its radial derivative at @xmath86 and presents the expected behavior , i.e. high and low pressures appears in the high energy density ( core ) an low energy density ( mantle ) regions respectively . the geometric mass increases rapidly in the liquid region and slowly in the gas region , it also presents a discontinuity in its radial derivative at the same radius of the star .",
    "we note that the energy density and the pressure goes to zero for large values of @xmath59 , so in principle we can match continuously to a schwarzschild free - space solution , as was done in neutron - star models @xcite , or to an exterior dust fluid ( with zero pressure ) .",
    "the metric components in the star are found through the functions ( @xmath89,@xmath90 ) from equations ( [ eq : e4 ] ) and ( [ eq : e5 ] ) .",
    "the integration constant from equation ( [ eq : e5 ] ) can be obtained by imposing that the component @xmath91 at a distant radius has to be equal to the schwarzschild exterior solution    @xmath92    where @xmath93 is the radius of the star .",
    "the component @xmath94 is calculated directly from equation ( [ eq : e4 ] ) .",
    "these components are depicted in figure [ fig : g00g11 ] .",
    "we note in this figure that the component @xmath91 of the metric does not present discontinuities in the phase transition region as found in the radial derivative of the @xmath94 component at @xmath86 .",
    "this motivate us to think that , in general , the phase transition could be manifested only in the spatial part of the metric .",
    "to study the space - time curvature in a system with phase transition , we used the kretschmann invariant ( @xmath95 ) . with the help of relations ( [ eq:14.12a ] )",
    ", we find that the kretschamnn invariant can be written as    @xmath96    in figure [ fig : g00g11 ] we see that the kretschmann invariant present a similar behavior than the energy density , i.e. highest curvature values in the core of the star and at long distances the curvature tends to zero .",
    "the kretschmann invariant depends on the values of the pressure , energy density and geometric mass , so it is normal to expect a discontinuity in the coexistence region at the same sphere radius ( @xmath97 ) . for a better understanding of the curvature associated to the phase transition",
    ", we project the riemann tensor along the orthonormal tetrad @xmath98 , where @xmath48 is the contravariant tensor index and @xmath99 a label distinguishing the particular vector .",
    "so , we have    @xmath100    in our case the orthonormal tetrad is    @xmath101^{-1}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and we obtain the following non null components of the riemann tensor :    @xmath102    these components are plotted in figure [ fig : g00g11 ] . we see that all the components are functions of the class _ c@xmath103 _ .",
    "we have discontinuous radial derivative at @xmath86 .",
    "in particular the components @xmath104 and @xmath105 present the same abrupt change that the kretschmann scalar .",
    "the kretschmann scalar can be written as a function of the non zero components of the riemann - christoffel curvature tensor ( [ riemanncompts ] ) .",
    "so , we can assure that the abrupt change in the kretschmann scalar is due to the components @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "these two components depend on the reduce energy density @xmath29 .",
    "so , we can state that the abrupt change in the kretschmann scalar can be thought as a curvature transition in the star due to the loss of energy needed for the phase transition to occur , see the energy density profile from figure [ fig : d(r ) ] .",
    "we note that discontinuities in the scalar curvature are not rare phenomena in nature .",
    "one simple example of this discontinuity is provided by a simple star model described in its exterior by the schwarzschild solution and its interior by the solutions corresponding to a homogeneous sphere @xcite . in this case there",
    "exist a discontinuity in the scalar curvature mainly because the energy    density has a discontinuity , constant inside the star and zero outside .",
    "we studied a model of a stationary spherical symmetric system in phase transition .",
    "the system is a ball of fluid made with identical and auto - gravitating particles with the energy - momentum tensor of a perfect fluid that obeys a van der walls like equation of state .",
    "this model appears to be the most simple and general model to describe a stellar object that undergoes a phase transition .",
    "the phase transition in the thermodynamic quantities is manifested as an abrupt change in the energy density , and discontinuities in the radial derivatives of the pressure and geometric mass at a fix radius .",
    "this radius divides the star in two regions : one with a high energy density ( a liquid core ) and the other with low energy density ( a gas mantle ) . in the space - time geometry of the star ,",
    "we see an abrupt change in the kretschmann invariant and some components of the riemann tensor .",
    "these can be thought as a curvature transition process due to the loss of energy needed for the phase transition to occur .",
    "a discontinuity in the radial derivative is also present in the spatial component of the metric but not in its time component , this lead us to think that phase transitions could be manifested only in the spatial part of the metric . for the results obtained in this work , we interpret the stationary system studied as a foliation of concentric and isobaric spherical surfaces where the phase transition occurs in only one of these surfaces .",
    "we note that the procedure used in this article can be applied to other models , such as systems with different kind of particles and systems characterized with more than one phase transition .",
