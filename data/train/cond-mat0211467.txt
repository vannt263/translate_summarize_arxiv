    "since the pioneering discovery of superconductivity in cecu@xmath5si@xmath5 , @xcite elucidation of the mechanism of unconventional superconductivity in heavy fermion compounds has been one of the central issues both in the experimental and theoretical research fields of condensed matter physics . in particular",
    ", further discoveries of superconductivity in uranium compounds such as ube@xmath6,@xcite uru@xmath5si@xmath5,@xcite upt@xmath7,@xcite upd@xmath5al@xmath7,@xcite and uni@xmath5al@xmath7@xcite have triggered a rapid increase of vigorous investigations on exotic properties of superconductivity in @xmath0-electron materials .",
    "recently there has occurred a second rush of new discoveries of superconductivity in @xmath0-electron compounds .",
    "one such is the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism in uge@xmath5@xcite and urhge.@xcite after this discovery , much attention has been attracted to the mechanism of unconventional triplet superconductivity in @xmath0-electron systems , since it is naively believed that triplet pairing can coexist in the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "a second example is the family of ce - based heavy fermion superconductors cemin@xmath4 ( m = ir , rh , and co).@xcite surprisingly , cecoin@xmath4 exhibits a superconducting transition temperature @xmath8=2.3k , which is the highest among those yet observed for heavy fermion materials at ambient pressure . on the other hand",
    ", ceirin@xmath4 shows @xmath8=0.4k , which is much less than that of cecoin@xmath4 .",
    "note that cerhin@xmath4 is an antiferromagnet with a nel temperature @xmath9=3.8k at ambient pressure , while under high - pressure it becomes superconducting at @xmath8=2.1k .",
    "it is interesting that the ground state properties of these compounds are easily changed by transition metal ions .",
    "third is the superconductivity of the filled skutterudite compound pros@xmath10sb@xmath11 with @xmath8=1.85k and a mass enhancement factor as large as fifty.@xcite again , a relatively high @xmath8 is surprising , while an interesting point is that the ground state is suggested to belong to @xmath12 , leading to a potential role played by quadrupole fluctuations in the mechanism of superconductivity .",
    "another amazing result is the discovery of superconductivity in pucoga@xmath4 with @xmath8=18.5k.@xcite although it is difficult to synthesize this compound and to measure various physical quantities , owing to the inclusion of plutonium , this is truly high @xmath8 and its mechanism is rather mysterious .    among several remarkable features both of new and old @xmath0-electron superconductors ,",
    "one interesting and important point is the common observation of anisotropic cooper - pairing , experimentally suggested by the power - law behavior of physical quantities in the low - temperature region .",
    "as is well known , the value of the power sensitively depends on the node structure of the gap function on the fermi surface .",
    "thus , by analysing carefully the temperature dependence of physical quantities in experiments , it is possible to deduce the symmetry of the cooper pairs under the group - theoretical restrictions . as a result of this phenomenological analysis",
    ", it has been clarified that the superconducting gap in @xmath0-electron materials has nodes on the fermi surface , indicating that non @xmath13-wave cooper pairing occurs in heavy fermion superconductors .",
    "the appearance of non @xmath13-wave pairing itself is easily understood as an effect of strong short - range correlation , if we recall the fact that the cooper pair is composed of a pair of @xmath0 electrons with heavy effective mass . since",
    "superconductivity in heavy fermion materials is a second - order transition phenomenon , the ginzburg - landau theory is still applicable to @xmath0-electron superconductors if we take into account the symmetry of the cooper pairs as well as the crystal structure with the help of group - theoretical arguments .",
    "such efforts have been quite useful to promote the understanding of the nature of unconventional superconductivity without considering the mechanism of the cooper - pair formation.@xcite    as for the microscopic aspects of the mechanism of unconventional superconductivity , it has at least been confirmed that the strong short - range coulomb interaction plays a crucial role .",
    "for instance , it brings about antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations , @xcite which induce singlet @xmath14-wave superconductivity , @xcite consistent with the node structure suggested by some experiments .",
    "it is true that in some @xmath0-electron materials , anisotropic singlet pairing is stabilized , but in upt@xmath7 , it has been experimentally confirmed that triplet pairing occurs.@xcite quite recently , also in uni@xmath5al@xmath7 , a possibility of triplet pairing has been discussed.@xcite unfortunately , the triplet pair formation as well as the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism can not be simply explained as the effect of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations .",
    "one may naively consider that instead , we can include the effect of ferromagnetic spin fluctuations , which was proposed for the origin of superfluidity in helium 3 .",
    "however , we then immediately face another problem , i.e. , how to obtain such fluctuations from the strong short - range coulomb interaction",
    ". it may be possible to derive this based on a realistic electronic band structure , but we do not find that paramagnons are always dominant in the spin fluctuation spectrum when we survey the magnetic properties of those materials .",
    "in fact , in ruthenate sr@xmath5ruo@xmath10,@xcite which is experimentally confirmed to be a triplet superconductor,@xcite instead we find that the incommensurate antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation is enhanced , as observed in neutron scattering experiments.@xcite namely , in contrast to our naive expectation , paramagnons do not seem to play a central role in the occurrence of triplet superconductivity in the solid state . thus , it is still a puzzling and challenging problem to clarify what is the key issue which determines the symmetry of cooper pairs , singlet or triplet , in @xmath0-electron superconductors .    in order to understand this point ,",
    "it is necessary to perform a microscopic analysis based on a model hamiltonian appropriate for @xmath0-electron systems , but unfortunately , we find such a model to be lacking . it may be possible to consider this problem based on the single - band hubbard model , which is believed to describe well the properties of strongly correlated electron systems . in fact , several basic features of high @xmath8 cuprates have been understood based on the hubbard model by analyzing it using various kinds of analytical and numerical techniques.@xcite however , this model is too simplified to include differences among materials characterized by @xmath15 degrees of freedom , although recently , the active role of orbitals has been widely recognized in several materials as a means for understanding novel magnetism and unconventional superconductivity .",
    "for instance , in manganites , @xmath16 orbitals play a primary role for electronic properties,@xcite since orbital ordering has been successfully observed in manganites by means of the resonant x - ray scattering measurement .",
    "@xcite in order to investigate systems with active orbital degrees of freedom , it is necessary to analyze the multi - orbital hubbard model .",
    "such an extension of the model does not bring essential difficulty , at least in @xmath14-electron materials .",
    "for instance , in @xmath17 electron systems such as ruthenate sr@xmath5ruo@xmath10 introduced above , it has been found that a three @xmath18-orbital tight - binding model can well reproduce the experimental results , as can band - structure calculations.@xcite    however , if we try to construct such a model also for @xmath0-electron materials , we immediately find a serious problem .",
    "since the spin - orbit interaction is fairly strong in @xmath0-electron systems , the meaning of a single @xmath0-electron state is unclear .",
    "even if this point is overcome , we find another difficulty in the evaluation of hopping amplitudes as well as coulomb interactions based on a good representation for one @xmath0-electron state .",
    "in addition , we need to include correctly the important effects of crystalline electric fields ( cef ) , which are very often essential for some @xmath0-electron systems .    in this paper , we attempt to go beyond all those problems through use of the @xmath1-@xmath1 coupling scheme , in order to construct an appropriate microscopic hamiltonian for @xmath0-electron compounds , including the hopping amplitudes , coulomb interactions , and cef terms .",
    "the hamiltonian obtained is a multi - orbital hubbard - like model .",
    "after construction of the model , we exhibit a couple of practical models , simplified by discarding one orbital degree of freedom .",
    "then , as an typical example , one simplified model is analyzed by using exact diagonalization techniques to evaluate several kinds of correlation functions .",
    "especially , the superconducting pair correlation function is carefully analyzed based on the concept of off - diagonal long - range order .",
    "finally , we will discuss the relation between the present theoretical results and some properties of cemin@xmath4 .",
    "we also try to give a possible explanation for superconducting and antiferromagnetic tendencies in `` 115 '' materials including cemin@xmath4 , umga@xmath4 , and pucoga@xmath4 , based on our microscopic picture .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .  2 ,",
    "the construction of the microscopic model hamiltonian based on the @xmath1-@xmath1 coupling scheme is discussed in detail .",
    "the coulomb interaction terms , cef terms , and the hopping amplitudes are evaluated by paying due attention to @xmath0-orbital symmetry .",
    "two types of simplified models are also introduced . in sec .  3 ,",
    "one of the simplified models will be analyzed by showing the results of spin , charge , orbital , and pair correlation functions .",
    "a prescription to measure the pair correlation will be also discussed . finally in sec .  4 , the paper is summarized and properties of 115-materials such as cemin@xmath4 , umga@xmath4 , and pucoga@xmath4 are discussed . throughout the paper ,",
    "we use units such that @xmath19=@xmath20=1 .",
    "in this section we construct a microscopic model hamiltonian for @xmath0-electron systems in order to discuss unconventional superconductivity and novel magnetism from the microscopic viewpoint . for this purpose",
    ", the model must include correctly the itinerant nature of @xmath0 electrons as well as strong electron correlation and the effect of cef .",
    "namely , the hamiltonian @xmath21 should be composed of three parts as @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are @xmath0-electron hopping , coulomb interactions among @xmath0 electrons , and the cef term , respectively .    in order to express the hamiltonian in the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) , it is requested that the one @xmath0-electron state should be well - defined by using a label @xmath2 .",
    "the physical meaning of @xmath2 will be discussed later in detail , but here it is convenient to define a second quantized operator to express the state @xmath26 as @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the vacuum and @xmath29 is the creation operator for @xmath0 electrons in the @xmath2-state at site @xmath30 .    by using the second - quantized operator @xmath29 defined above",
    ", the kinetic term can be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the overlap integral between the @xmath2- and @xmath33-states connected by the vector @xmath34 .",
    "the coulomb interaction term is given in the form of @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the matrix element for coulomb interactions . finally , the cef term is expressed by @xmath37 where @xmath38 indicates the potential energy for @xmath0 electrons which expresses the effect of the cef .",
    "now our tasks in this section are as follows : ( i ) specification of the meaning of @xmath2 for one @xmath0-electron state .",
    "( ii ) evaluation of the hopping amplitude , coulomb matrix elements , and cef coefficients .",
    "( iii ) simplification of the model for practical purposes . in the following subsections ,",
    "all of these points will be clarified in this order .",
    "first let us discuss the meaning of @xmath2 in the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) . to make it clear ,",
    "it is instructive to start the discussion with the single ion problem using two typical approaches , the @xmath40 coupling and @xmath1-@xmath1 coupling schemes . in general",
    ", we consider the @xmath41 configuration , where @xmath42 is the number of @xmath0 electrons included on a localized ion . in the @xmath40 coupling scheme ,",
    "first the spin @xmath43 and angular momentum @xmath44 are formed by following hund s rules as @xmath43=@xmath45 and @xmath44=@xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are spin and angular momentum for @xmath49-th @xmath0-electron .",
    "note here that the hund s rules are based on the pauli principle and coulomb interactions among @xmath0 electrons . after forming @xmath43 and @xmath44",
    ", we include the effect of spin - orbit interaction @xmath50@xmath44@xmath51@xmath43 , where @xmath50 is the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "note that @xmath50@xmath520 for @xmath42@xmath537 , while @xmath50@xmath530 for @xmath42@xmath527 .",
    "note also that a good quantum number to label such a state is the total angular momentum @xmath54 , given by @xmath54=@xmath44+@xmath43 . following from simple algebra ,",
    "the ground - state level is characterized by @xmath55=@xmath56@xmath57@xmath58 for @xmath42@xmath537 , while @xmath55=@xmath59+@xmath60 for @xmath42@xmath527 .    as is easily understood from the above discussion",
    ", the @xmath40 coupling scheme is valid under the assumption that the hund s rule coupling is much larger than the spin - orbit interaction , since @xmath43 and @xmath44 are formed by the hund s rule coupling prior to the inclusion of spin - orbit interaction .",
    "it is considered that this assumption is valid for insulating compounds with localized @xmath0 electrons . however , when the spin - orbit interaction is not small compared with the hund s rule coupling , especially in actinide ions , the above assumption is not always satisfied .",
    "in addition , if the @xmath0 electrons become itinerant owing to hybridization with the conduction electrons , the effect of coulomb interactions would thereby be effectively reduced . in rough estimation ,",
    "the effective size of the coulomb interaction may be as large as the bandwidth of @xmath0 electrons , leading to a violation of the assumption required for the @xmath40 coupling scheme .    for @xmath0-electron systems in which the spin - orbit interaction becomes larger than the effective coulomb interactions , it is useful to consider the problem in the @xmath1-@xmath1 coupling scheme .",
    "here we emphasize that the @xmath1-@xmath1 coupling scheme is also quite convenient for including many - body effects using the standard quantum - field theoretical techniques , since individual @xmath0-electron states can be clearly defined , as explained below .",
    "first , we include the spin - orbit coupling so as to define the state labelled by the total angular momentum @xmath61 for the @xmath49-th electron , given by @xmath61=@xmath47+@xmath48 . for @xmath0-orbitals with @xmath62=3",
    ", we immediately obtain an octet with @xmath1=7/2(=3 + 1/2 ) and a sextet with @xmath1=5/2(=3@xmath571/2 ) , which are well separated by the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "note here that the level for the octet is higher than that of the sextet .",
    "then , we take into account the effect of coulomb interactions to accommodate @xmath42 electrons among the sextet and/or octet , leading to the ground - state level in the @xmath1-@xmath1 coupling scheme .    here , the meaning of @xmath2 in our hamiltonian becomes clear . in the case of @xmath42@xmath537",
    ", @xmath2 should be the label to specify the state in the @xmath1=5/2 sextet , namely , the @xmath3-component of the total angular momentum @xmath1=5/2 and takes the values of @xmath2=@xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "note here that for 3@xmath53@xmath42@xmath537 , @xmath1=7/2 octet is @xmath67 occupied , since we presume that the effect of spin - orbit interaction is larger than that of the hund s rule coupling in the @xmath1-@xmath1 coupling scheme . on the other hand , for the case of @xmath42@xmath687 ,",
    "@xmath2 should be considered to specify the state in the @xmath1=7/2 octet , since @xmath1=5/2 sextet is fully occupied .",
    "note again that spin - orbit interaction is larger than that of the hund s rule coupling . in this paper , we concentrate only on the case of @xmath42@xmath537 , especially the situation with @xmath42=1 and 2 , corresponding to ce@xmath69 and u@xmath70 ions .",
    "thus , in the following , @xmath2 indicates the @xmath3-component of the total angular momentum which specifies the state in the @xmath1=5/2 sextet .",
    "now let us consider the ground - state multiplet appearing in the @xmath1-@xmath1 coupling scheme .",
    "for this purpose , first it is necessary to define the coulomb interaction @xmath36 in @xmath24 , which is the sum of two contributions , written as @xmath71 where the former indicates the coulomb term , while the latter denotes the exchange one .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath36 vanishes unless @xmath2+@xmath33=@xmath72+@xmath73 due to the conservation of @xmath3-component of total angular momentum .",
    "the matrix element @xmath74 is explicitly given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the clebsch - gordan coefficient , given as @xmath77 with @xmath78=@xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) for up ( down ) real spin .",
    "the coulomb matrix element among @xmath62-orbitals is given by @xmath81 where @xmath82=@xmath83 and @xmath84 is the wavefunction for the @xmath85 state in @xmath62=3 orbitals , expressed by the product of the radial function and spherical harmonic @xmath86 .",
    "the matrix element @xmath87 can be written in the form of @xmath88 where the sum on @xmath89 includes only even values ( @xmath89=0 , 2 , 4 , and 6 ) , @xmath90 is the slater - condon parameter@xcite including the complex integral of the radial function , and @xmath91 is the gaunt coefficient,@xcite which is tabulated in the standard textbooks of quantum mechanics ( see , for instance , ref .  ) .    when two electrons are accommodated in the @xmath1=5/2 sextet , the allowed values for total angular momentum @xmath55 are 0 , 2 , and 4 due to the pauli principle .",
    "thus , the coulomb interaction term should be written in a 15@xmath9215 matrix form .",
    "note that `` 15 '' is the sum of the basis numbers for singlet ( @xmath55=0 ) , quintet ( @xmath55=2 ) , and nontet ( @xmath55=4 ) .",
    "as is easily understood , this 15@xmath9215 matrix can be decomposed into a block - diagonalized form labelled by @xmath93 , including one 3@xmath923 matrix for @xmath93=0 , four 2@xmath922 matrices for @xmath93=@xmath942 and @xmath941 , and four 1@xmath921 for @xmath93=@xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "we skip the details of tedious calculations for the matrix elements and here only summarize the results in the following by using the racah parameters @xmath97 ( @xmath89=0,1,2),@xcite which are related to the slater - condon parameters @xmath90 as @xmath98 for @xmath93=4 and 3 , we obtain @xmath99 and @xmath100 respectively . for @xmath93=2 and 1 , we obtain @xmath101 and @xmath102 finally , for @xmath93=0 , we obtain @xmath103 note here the following relations : @xmath104 and @xmath105 by using these two relations and eqs .  ( [ eq : jz4]-[eq : jz0 ] ) , we can obtain all the coulomb matrix elements.@xcite    as a typical example , let us consider the @xmath106 configuration . in the @xmath1-@xmath1 coupling schemes , two",
    "electrons are accommodated in the @xmath1=5/2 sextet .",
    "when we diagonalize the 15@xmath9215 matrix for coulomb interaction terms , we can easily obtain the eigen energies as @xmath107@xmath57@xmath108 for the @xmath55=4 nontet , @xmath107+@xmath109 for the @xmath55=2 quintet , and @xmath107+@xmath110 for the @xmath55=0 singlet.@xcite since the racah parameters are all positive , the ground state is specified by @xmath55=4 in the @xmath1-@xmath1 coupling scheme . in the @xmath40 coupling scheme ,",
    "on the other hand , we obtain the ground - state level as @xmath111 with @xmath60=1 and @xmath59=5 from the hund s rules . on further inclusion of the spin - orbit interaction ,",
    "the ground state becomes characterized by @xmath55=4 , expressed as @xmath112 in the traditional notation .",
    "note that we are now considering a two - electron problem .",
    "thus , if we correctly include the effects of coulomb interactions , it is concluded that the same quantum number as that in the @xmath40 coupling scheme is obtained in the @xmath1-@xmath1 coupling scheme for the ground - state multiplet .    in order to understand the physical meaning of racah parameters ,",
    "let us consider a simplified coulomb interaction term . in the above discussion",
    ", the expressions using racah parameters are not convenient since they depend on the orbitals in a very complicated manner , although they keep the correct symmetry required by group theory . to clarify their meanings",
    ", it may be useful to restart the discussion from the following interaction form among @xmath113 orbitals : @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the annihilation operator for an @xmath0 electron with spin @xmath78 in the @xmath85 state of angular momentum @xmath62 at site * i * and @xmath116= @xmath117 . in this equation , we include only three interactions ; intra - orbital coulomb interaction @xmath118 , inter - orbital coulomb interaction @xmath119 , and the exchange interaction @xmath55 .",
    "note that the relation @xmath118=@xmath119+@xmath55 holds among coulomb interactions to ensure rotational invariance in the orbital space .    by using clebsch - gordan coefficients , @xmath115 with real - spin @xmath78 can be related to @xmath120 as @xmath121 note here that we consider only the @xmath122 sextet . the coulomb interaction term for @xmath1=5/2 is given by @xmath123 where @xmath124=@xmath125 , @xmath126=@xmath127 , @xmath128=@xmath119@xmath57@xmath129 , @xmath130=@xmath131 , and @xmath132 is the operator for total angular momentum with @xmath55=5/2 .",

    ", we can easily obtain the energy levels as @xmath128@xmath57@xmath137 for the @xmath55=4 nontet , @xmath128+@xmath138 for the @xmath55=2 quintet , and @xmath128+@xmath139 for the @xmath55=0 singlet .",
    "when we compare these energy levels with the results obtained using racah parameters , we understand the correspondence such as @xmath107@xmath140@xmath128 and @xmath141@xmath140@xmath130 .",
    "namely , @xmath107 is the effective inter - orbital coulomb interaction , while @xmath141 denotes the hund s rule coupling .",
    "note that @xmath142 does not appear , since it is related to the pair - hopping interaction which is not included here .    finally , we note the smallness of @xmath130 , given as @xmath130=@xmath131 .",
    "the origin of the large reduction factor 1/49 is , in one word , due to the neglect of @xmath1=7/2 octet . in the coulomb interaction term eq .",
    "( [ eq : hint2 ] ) , the hund s rule term is simply written as @xmath143 .",

    ", we easily obtain @xmath145=6/7 , indicating @xmath43=@xmath147 .",

    "as is well known , the ground - state multiplet is further split due to the effect of the cef . in this paper",
    "we take into account the effect of the cef by simply accommodating several electrons in the one - electron potential .",

    "in the previous section , we have discussed in detail the construction of a microscopic model for @xmath0-electron systems based on the @xmath1-@xmath1 coupling scheme . for practical purposes ,",

    "we show exact diagonalization results for @xmath249 as a typical example of an orbital degenerate system .      before proceeding to the exhibition of calculated results ,",
    "let us discuss the quantities we would measure in a model including orbital degree of freedom .",
    "first of all , in order to see the spin and charge structure , it is quite natural to measure the spin and charge correlation functions , defined as @xmath280 and @xmath281 respectively , where @xmath282@xmath57@xmath283 and @xmath284 . on the other hand , in order to see the orbital structure , it is quite useful to calculate the orbital correlation function , given by @xmath285 as is easily understood from the above equations , even if the orbital degree of freedom is further included in the model hamiltonian , there is no ambiguity in the definitions for spin and charge correlations , given by sums in terms of an orbital index . for the orbital correlations , we also consider as an orbital - dependent charge correlation , which can be defined without any difficulty .",
    "however , when we attempt to discuss the superconducting pair correlation , we immediately encounter some serious problems .",
    "namely , it is necessary to determine the form factors for the pairing states in both momentum and orbital space .",
    "note that even in the single - orbital hubbard model , it is necessary to determine the momentum dependence , but in general , our task can be reduced through the help of a group - theoretical analysis . in the orbital degenerate model , the extra task of determining the form factor in orbital space",
    "is also imposed upon us . especially in the present realistic models , in which the orbital degree of freedom does @xmath67",
    "provide a good quantum number , the situation seems to be very severe at first glance , since we can not resort to a group - theoretical analysis for the orbital dependence of the form factor .    in order to overcome this problem ,",
    "we carefully reconsider it based on the concept of off - diagonal long - range order.@xcite let us define the pair correlation as @xmath286 where the subscript @xmath57 ( @xmath287 ) denotes spin singlet ( triplet ) pairing and @xmath288 is a pair operator , given in general by @xmath289 since a pair with zero total momentum is considered here , @xmath290 depends only on @xmath34 , which is the vector connecting the sites .",
    "note also that the orbital dependence of @xmath290 is not solely determined by symmetry considerations .",
    "we can easily show that the pair correlation is written in the form @xmath291 where the matrix element @xmath292 is written as @xmath293/2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here it is necessary to recall the concept of off - diagonal long - range order.@xcite namely , the occurrence of superconductivity is detected when the largest eigenvalue of the pair correlation matrix becomes the order of @xmath294 , where @xmath294 is the number of electrons .",
    "thus , in a small cluster calculation , the possible superconducting pair state should be defined by the eigenstate with the maximum eigenvalue @xmath295 of the matrix @xmath296 . of course , in order to prove the existence of off - diagonal long - range order , we need to show that @xmath295 becomes the order of @xmath294 with increasing the cluster size . however , at some cluster size , a possible pairing state is determined without ambiguity by the eigenstate with @xmath295 .    a prescription to define the pair operator is briefly summarized .",
    "first , we determine the pair correlation matrix @xmath292 .",
    "then we diagonalize it , and the form factor @xmath290 will be defined by the eigenstate corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue of the pair correlation matrix .      in the previous subsection , we have discussed a way to define the pair operator in orbital degenerate systems .",
    "here we further consider the symmetry of the cooper pair in orbital space from a general point of view .",
    "anomalous green s functions for spin triplet and singlet pairs are , respectively , defined by @xmath297,\\ ] ] and @xmath298,\\ ] ] where @xmath299=@xmath300 and @xmath301 denotes imaginary time . due to cyclic invariance of the trace",
    ", we obtain the following relations : @xmath302 where @xmath220 is the inverse temperature .",
    "further , after fourier transformation , we obtain @xmath303 where @xmath304 is the fermion matsubara frequency , given by @xmath304=@xmath305(2@xmath42 + 1 ) with @xmath42 an integer .",
    "these are the basic relations representing the symmetry of cooper pairs in orbital degenerate systems .",
    "except for differences in the spin states such as singlet and triplet , `` parity '' is the only extra good quantum number to specify the pairing state , since there is no conservation law regarding orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , we can produce even- and odd - parity states , satisfying @xmath306 where @xmath307 indicate the operator to change @xmath308 to @xmath309 .",
    "it is easy to understand that @xmath310 is given by linear combinations of @xmath311 and @xmath312 .",
    "although we can not define @xmath310 uniquely , it is convenient to consider combinations of odd and even functions both for orbital exchange and sign - change in frequency .",
    "if we introduce two orbitals `` a '' and `` b '' , then after some simple algebra , we obtain @xmath313 where @xmath314 is an arbitrary number and @xmath315 is given by @xmath316 since the present hamiltonian is @xmath67 invariant with orbital exchange , @xcite the terms `` orbital symmetric '' and `` orbital antisymmetric '' can not be used as a label to specify the state .",
    "however , it is convenient to categorize @xmath315 as follows : the @xmath317 ( @xmath49=1@xmath1403 ) are orbital - symmetric and even function of frequency , while the @xmath318 ( @xmath49=1@xmath1403 ) are orbital - symmetric and odd function of frequency . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath319 is orbital - antisymmetric and an odd function of frequency , while @xmath320 is orbital - antisymmetric and an even function of frequency .",
    "if we consider the zero - frequency limit , we can simply drop the odd functions of frequency .",
    "namely , the even - parity pair is expressed as a combination of orbital - symmetric functions , while the odd - parity solution is just given by @xmath320 , the orbital - antisymmetric part .",
    "note , however , that this is just an accident due to the vanishing of odd - functions of frequency .",
    "we must @xmath67 consider that the orbital state provides a good label to specify the pairing symmetry , although it is a convenient way to classify the pair state .",
    "again , it is stressed that spin state and parity are labels used to specify the pairing symmetry .    for the case of spin triplet , it is easy to repeat the same discussion as that for spin singlet .",
    "note that in the zero - frequency limit , the odd - parity solution is given by the combination of orbital - symmetric parts , while the even - parity function is expressed only by the orbital - antisymmetric part .",
    "up to now we have discussed the general situation in which the system is @xmath67 invariant under the exchange of orbitals .",
    "we believe that this is quite natural since in actual materials , the shapes of orbitals are different from one another .",
    "however , it is possible to consider a fictitious hamiltonian which is invariant under orbital exchange . in such a situation ,",
    "the words `` orbital symmetric '' and `` orbital antisymmetric '' recover physical meanings which distinguish the pairing states .",
    "namely , we can further classify anomalous green s functions as @xmath321 where the subscripts @xmath287 and @xmath57 denotes parity even and odd , while `` s '' and `` a '' indicate the orbital - symmetric and orbital antisymmetric , respectively . in this case",
    ", the frequency dependence is automatically classified : even - function for @xmath322 and @xmath323 and odd - function for @xmath324 and @xmath325 .",
    "finally , it is again stressed that when we consider pair correlation in the static limit , at first glance , orbital symmetric and antisymmetric parts seem to be separated , but such a separation is spurious owing to the speciality of the static limit .",
    "next we show results obtained using exact diagonalization techniques for an 8-site tilted cluster .",
    "since we attempt to make some comparison with cemin@xmath4 , we consider a two - dimensional lattice .",
    "first we consider the case of quarter filling , i.e. , @xmath42=1 .",
    "note here that @xmath55 and @xmath247 are simply neglected , since they are considered to be irrelevant in the case of @xmath42=1 . as shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) , for @xmath246@xmath530.5 , there is no dominant component in @xmath326 , indicating a paramagnetic ( pm ) phase , while for @xmath246@xmath520.5 , @xmath327 becomes abruptly dominant , strongly suggesting an antiferromagnetic ( af ) phase .",
    "this abrupt change is due to level crossing , but it is instructive to see the charge and orbital correlations . in fig .",
    "4(b ) , we show charge correlation , exhibiting again an abrupt change around @xmath246@xmath1820.5 .",
    "a decrease of charge correlation is the signature of a metal - insulator transition , since the charge fluctuations are suppressed in the mott insulator . as observed in fig .",
    "4(c ) , we can see an orbital disordered ( od ) phase for @xmath246@xmath530.5 and a ferro - orbital ( fo ) phase for @xmath246@xmath520.5 . by monitoring the change in spin correlations",
    ", we can draw the ground - state phase diagram for @xmath42=1 , as shown in fig .",
    "we see od / pm phase for small @xmath118 and fo / af phase for large @xmath118 region .     for @xmath118=@xmath119=4 and @xmath55=@xmath247=0 .",
    "( d ) ground - state phase diagram for the @xmath163 model for @xmath118=@xmath119 with @xmath55=@xmath247=0 .",
    "( e ) pair correlations vs. @xmath246 both for spin singlet and triplet states .",
    "( f ) pair amplitude in momentum space for the singlet state having the maximum eigenvalue of the pair correlation matrix .",
    "note that it is shown separately for @xmath328 , @xmath329 , and @xmath330+@xmath331 pair states . ]    in fig .",
    "4(e ) , we show the eigenvalues of the pair correlation matrices for spin singlet and triplet states as a function of @xmath246 .",
    "the state with the largest eignevalue is a singlet , while a triplet appears as the second largest eigenvalue state .",
    "even if we introduce a finite value of @xmath55 , unfortunetely , this triplet state is @xmath67 the largest eigen - value state , at least within the present 8-site calculation .",
    "however , in the previous analysis using the random phase approximation , the appearance of a triplet state has been suggested in the small @xmath246 region.@xcite it may be related to the present result having the triplet state as the second largest eigenvalue state .    in fig .",
    "4(f ) , the pair amplitudes for the largest eigen - value state is shown in momentum space .",
    "since we are measuring the static pair correlation , we can observe here an `` orbital symmetric '' state with `` aa '' , `` bb '' , and `` ab+ba '' , while the `` orbital antisymmetric '' part such as `` ab@xmath57ba '' is not mixed .",
    "as discussed in the previous subsection , it is just an accident due to the static limit , and the orbital symmetric state is @xmath67 separated in general .",
    "next we focus on the momentum dependence of each component . as seen in fig .",
    "4(f ) , the",
    "`` aa '' and `` bb '' parts of the pair amplitude exhibit @xmath332 , while `` ab+ba '' seems to belong to @xmath333 . if we recall that `` a '' and `` b '' each correspond to @xmath16 orbitals , then they have different signs for @xmath334 rotation in space",
    "thus , there exists a discrepancy in the symmetry between ( `` aa '' , `` bb '' ) and `` ab+ba '' components , although the total symmetry should be @xmath332 in this case .    we have obtained a simultaneous onset of spin and orbital ordering , which can be interpreted as a transition between pm and afm phases controlled by the suppression of orbital fluctuations .",
    "moreover , just around the transition regime between pm and afm phases , we can expect the appearance of @xmath14-wave superconductivity induced by afm spin fluctuations , which has been identified as the @xmath332 pairing state with the largest eigenvalue .",
    "in fact , the present model has been analyzed using the random phase approximation , leading to a transition between pm and @xmath14-wave superconducting phases with an increase of @xmath246.@xcite if we further increase @xmath246 , eventually the system becomes an afm insulating phase , and this successive transition agrees with the present results .",
    "here it is stressed that the orbital degree of freedom plays a key role to control the ground - state properties .",
    "we believe that this viewpoint is applicable to the appearance of @xmath14-wave superconductivity in cemin@xmath4 , although the quantitative features should be discussed in detail using the @xmath160 model .",

    "( b ) amplitude for triplet pairing in momentum space , evaluated from the eigenstate corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue of the pair correlation matrix . ]",
    "next we consider the case of @xmath42=1.5 for the same @xmath163 model .",
    "for @xmath246=0 , we depict the phase diagram in the ( @xmath119,@xmath55 ) plane , as shown in fig .",
    "note that the region with @xmath55@xmath52@xmath119 is unphysical and here we just ignore it .",
    "we see the appearance of the ferromagnetic ( fm ) phase , which is stabilized due to the strong hund s rule coupling .",
    "the interesting point is the pair amplitude inside the fm phase , as shown in fig .",
    "the momentum dependence of the largest eigenvalue state is characterized by even parity . as naively expected , due to the hund s rule coupling",
    ", a local triplet is formed , but in order to gain kinetic energy , this pair should be spatially extended , as shown in fig .",
    "note here that this is @xmath333-like , since it is an even - parity state .",
    "since we are now considering the pairing state in the strong coupling region , there is no reason to exclude the triplet state with even parity , which is @xmath67 directly connected to the usual odd - parity triplet state .",
    "this is not surprising , since local triplet pair must have even parity , provided that one ion with @xmath0-orbitals is included in the unit cell .",
    "thus , quite generally , we can conclude that the odd - parity triplet pair is not stabilized in the local hund s rule coupling , at least in the bravais lattice , which is consistent with the previous discussion.@xcite    as for the mechanism of the attractive interaction in the pair inside the fm phase , it should be considered to be orbital fluctuations , since spin fluctuations are dead in the fully spin - polarized state .",
    "this point is intriguing due to a possible connection with the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism in uge@xmath5 .",
    "of course , in order to confirm such an exotic type of superconductivity , it would be necessary to consider the problem in the bulk limit using , for instance , the green s function method .",
    "this case will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "finally , we note that due care should be paid to the correspondence between pseudo - spin and total angular momentum @xmath54 , when we intend to make a comparison with actual materials . in experiments on @xmath0-electron compounds , for instance",
    ", the external magnetic field couples to @xmath54 , not to the pseudo - spin .",
    "thus , when we attempt to calculate physical quantities observed in actuality , it is necessary to consider the response of @xmath54 .",
    "the present analysis based on the pseudo - spin model is useful to see qualitiave tendencies , while a quantiative discussion is left for future development .",
    "-electrons in ce , u , and pu ions for the pseudo spin representations .",
    "each horizontal bar indicates the pseudo orbital . ]",
    "we have constructed a microscopic model hamiltonian for @xmath0-electron systems based on the @xmath1-@xmath1 coupling scheme : the coulomb matrix elements have been expressed in terms of the racah parameters , and the cef terms for the two - electron case have been determined by those for @xmath55=5/2 .",
    "the validity of this @xmath1-@xmath1 coupling picture has been carefully dicsussed in the present paper .",
    "the @xmath0-electron hopping amplitudes are obtained using slater s two - center integral .",
    "two types of simplified models have also been presented : one is a hamiltonian including @xmath163 and the other for @xmath160 levels .",
    "these are believed to be useful for further investigations of superconductivity and magnetism in @xmath0-electron systems    in this paper the @xmath163 model has been analyzed using the exact diagonalization method .",
    "we have measured several kinds of correlation functions and developed a prescription to define the pairing state in multi - orbital systems .",
    "furthermore , the symmetry of the orbital dependent cooper pair has been carefully discussed . in the analysis of the @xmath163 model , it has been suggested that unconventional superconductivity should appear around the phase boundary between metallic od - pm and insulating fo - afm phases .",
    "in addition , we have found evidence for triplet superconductivity in the ferromagnetic phase , induced by strong hund s rule coupling . with the present method of defining the pairing state",
    ", it has been found that the triplet pairing state is @xmath67 localized , but extended spatially to gain kinetic energy .",
    "based on the @xmath1-@xmath1 coupling scheme , it is easy to consider the case of several @xmath0 electrons per site .",
    "although we have not shown any results in this paper for the case of @xmath42=2 , corresponding to the @xmath336 ion ( see fig .",
    "6 ) , we have obtained that the ground - state is an afm insulator , which is driven by afm superexchange coupling between neighboring @xmath60=1 spins formed by the local hund s rule coupling .",
    "when we introduce a level splitting into this afm insulating state , we have found robustness for this phase , compared with the transition around @xmath246=0.5 for the case of @xmath42=1 . for umga@xmath4@xcite isostructural with cemin@xmath4 ,",
    "if the uranium ions are considered to take u@xmath69 , again it is naively deduced to have an afm ground state , if the local spin is formed by hund s rule coupling , as shown in fig .",
    "however , without any calculations , it is impossible to determine whether it is a metallic or insulating state , although in experiments , metallic afm phase has been suggested.@xcite this is left as a future problem .    as introduced in sec .  1",
    ", pucoga@xmath4 amazingly exhibits superconductivity with @xmath8=18.5k.@xcite in order to understand this high @xmath8 , first of all , we generally consider that the spatial extent of the @xmath337 wavefunction is large compared to that of @xmath259 electrons , leading to a larger hybridization among conduction and @xmath337 electrons .",
    "namely , the basic energy scale ( or effective bandwidth of the quasiparticles ) in the pu - compound should be larger than that of ce - materials .",
    "here we envision a scenario similar to the high-@xmath8 cuprates : if superconductivity in those `` 115 '' materials is considered to originate from an electronic mechanism , @xmath8 should be increased as the energy scale is enhanced . it may be useful to point out a possible analogy with high-@xmath8 materials , but we emphasize as a separate important issue the active role of orbitals , which discussed intensively in this paper .",
    "it has been deduced from the local moment behavior that the plutonium valence is pu@xmath69,@xcite indicating that five @xmath0-electrons are accommodated . in our @xmath1-@xmath1 coupling picture with pseudo - spin representation ,",
    "we can put five electrons in the sextet of @xmath1=5/2 , as shown in fig .",
    "6 , which is just the hole version of cemin@xmath4 .",
    "thus , the appearance of superconductivity itself may be understood without any calculations on the basis of our @xmath1-@xmath1 coupling picture .",
    "as explained above , the drastic changes of @xmath8 in the `` 115 '' materials may be understood , based on the difference in the energy scale for @xmath259 and @xmath337 electrons , but we believe that another key issue related to this problem would be the shape of the orbitals . a difference between the electron and hole pictures should exist stemming from the shape of the active orbital , as easily deduced from fig .",
    "if such differences among orbitals , i.e. , level schemes relating to the cef effect , will be clarified in those materials , it may be possible to obtain a unified view to understand unconventional superconductivity and novel magnetism in `` 115 '' materials including cemin@xmath4 , umga@xmath4 , and pucoga@xmath4 .",
    "this point will be further investigated based on the present model .    as repeatedly mentioned in this paper ,",
    "there remain several open questions in the electronic properties of @xmath0-electron materials .",
