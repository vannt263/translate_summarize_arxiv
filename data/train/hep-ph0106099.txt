    "investigation of processes with the pomeron exchange remains to be one of the important problems of high energy physics .",
    "a special attention is attracted by the so called semi - hard processes , where large values of typical momentum transfers @xmath13 give a possibility to use perturbative qcd for their theoretical description .",
    "the most common basis for such description is given by the bfkl approach  @xcite .",
    "it became widely known since discovery at hera of the sharp rise of the proton structure function at decrease of the bjorken variable @xmath14 ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "recently the total cross section of the interaction of two highly virtual photons was measured at lep .",
    "this process , being the one - scale process , seems to be even more natural for the application of the bfkl approach than the two - scale process of the deep inelastic scattering at small @xmath14 , since here the evolution in @xmath14 described by the bfkl equation does not interfere with the evolution in @xmath13 described by the dglap equation .    for a consistent comparison with the experimental data the theoretical predictions",
    "must be obtained in the next - to - leading approximation ( nla ) , where together with the leading terms @xmath15 the terms @xmath16 are also resumed .",
    "the radiative corrections to the kernel of the bfkl equation were calculated several years ago  @xcite-@xcite and the explicit form of the kernel of the equation in the nla is known now  @xcite for the case of forward scattering . but",
    "the problem of calculation in the nla of the so called impact factors , which describe the coupling of the pomeron to the scattering particles , remains unsolved .",
    "let us remind ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite for the details ) , that in the bfkl approach the relevant to the irreducible representation @xmath17 of the colour group in the @xmath18-channel part @xmath19 of the scattering amplitude for the process @xmath20 at large c.m.s .",
    "energy @xmath21 and fixed momentum transfer @xmath22 ( @xmath23 means transverse to the initial particle momenta plane ) is expressed in terms of the mellin transform of the green function of the two interacting reggeized gluons @xmath24 and of the impact factors of the colliding particles @xmath25 and @xmath26 : @xmath27 @xmath28\\phi_{b^\\prime b}^{(\\cal r , \\nu)}(-\\vec q_2 , -\\vec q , s_0),\\ ] ] where @xmath29 means the @xmath30-channel imaginary part , the vector sign is used for denotation of the transverse components , @xmath31 enumerates the states in the representation @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the space - time dimension different from @xmath34 to regularize both infrared and ultraviolet divergencies and the parameter @xmath35 is artificial and introduced for a convenience . while the green function obeys the generalized bfkl equation @xcite @xmath36 with the nla kernel @xmath37 and",
    "is completely defined by this equation , the impact factors should be calculated separately .",
    "the definition of the nla impact factors has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite ; in the case of definite colours of @xmath38 and @xmath39 of the reggeized gluons the impact factor has a form @xcite @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the reggeized gluon trajectory and the intermediate parameter @xmath44 should go to infinity .",
    "the integration in the first term of the above equality is carried out over the phase space @xmath45 and over the squared invariant mass @xmath46 of the system @xmath47 produced in the fragmentation region of the particle @xmath48 , @xmath49 are the particle - reggeon effective vertices for this production and the sum is taken over all systems @xmath47 which can be produced in the nla .",
    "the second term in eq . ( [ 13 ] ) is the counterterm for the lla part of the first one , so that the logarithmic dependence of both terms on the intermediate parameter @xmath50 disappears in their sum ; @xmath51 is the part of the leading order bfkl kernel related to the real gluon production ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the definition ( [ 13 ] ) guarantees infrared finiteness of the colourless particle impact factors .",
    "it is clear from above that for complete nla description in the bfkl approach one needs to know the impact factors , analogously as in the dglap approach one should know not only the parton distributions , but also the coefficient functions .",
    "this paper is an extended version of the short note @xcite , which can be considered as the first step in the calculation of the virtual photon impact factor in the nla .",
    "we calculate here the virtual photon - reggeon effective vertices which enter the definition ( [ 13 ] ) in the case when the particle @xmath48 is the virtual photon . in the nla",
    "the states which can be produced in the reggeon - virtual photon collision are the quark - antiquark and the quark - antiquark - gluon ones . in the next section we present the effective vertices for production of these states in the born approximation .",
    "this approximation is sufficient to find in the nla the contribution to the virtual photon impact factor from the quark - antiquark - gluon state . in the case of the quark - antiquark state",
    "we need to know the effective production vertex with the one - loop accuracy .",
    "sections 3 - 5 are devoted to the calculation of the one - loop corrections . in sections 3 and 4",
    "we consider the two - gluon and the one - gluon exchange diagrams correspondingly ; in section 5 the total one - loop correction is presented .",
    "the results obtained are discussed in section 6 .",
    "some details of the calculation are given in appendix a.    in the following the photon - reggeon effective vertices presented in this paper will be used for the calculation of the photon impact factor .",
    "but they could have many other applications , for example , in the diffractive production of quark jets and so on .",
    "in this section we present the vertices for the @xmath52 and the @xmath53 production in the reggeon - virtual photon collision in the born approximation for the case of completely massless qcd .",
    "these vertices can be obtained from the high energy amplitudes with the octet colour state and the negative signature in the @xmath18-channel for collision of the virtual photon with any particle , if the corresponding system is produced in the virtual photon fragmentation region . for simplicity",
    "we always consider collision of the virtual photon with the momentum @xmath54 and the quark with the momentum @xmath55 .",
    "we use everywhere below the feynman gauge for the gluon field , the sudakov decomposition of momenta @xmath56 @xmath57 with the lightcone basis in the longitudinal space defined by @xmath58 and the usual trick of retaining only the first term in the decomposition of the metric tensor @xmath59 in the numerator of the gluon propagator connecting vertices @xmath60 and @xmath31 with momenta predominantly along @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively .",
