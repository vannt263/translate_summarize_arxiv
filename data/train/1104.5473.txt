    "ngc  6791 is an extreme galactic star cluster with an old age of @xmath68  gyr @xcite , a high metallicity [ fe / h]=@xmath110.30 @xcite , and an unusual orbit that periodically brings it close to the bulge of the milky way @xcite .",
    "@xcite was the first to provide an estimate for the total mass of ngc  6791 : @xmath63700@xmath12 down to @xmath1320 , confirmed by @xcite .",
    "it is widely acknowledged that ngc  6791 is one of the most massive old open clusters in our galaxy .    as indicated by the discovery of several extremely blue subdwarfs @xcite and the presence of a prominent red clump , morphology of the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) for ngc  6791 is complex .",
    "the proposed enhanced mass loss along the red giant branch ( rgb ) appears to explain the presence of hot subdwarfs and the abnormally young 2.4  gyr white dwarf cooling age @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite reported that the cmd in the inner part of ngc  6791 ( @xmath14 ) is somewhat different from that in its outer part ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "specifically , there is a dichotomy near the main - sequence turnoff , which the authors interpret as a result of protracted star formation .",
    "this cluster is critically important to understanding a number of issues , such as stellar evolution and population synthesis at high metallicity in the milky way and other galaxies , specifically , in ellipticals and in spirals with bulges . due to its relative proximity and its abundance of members , ngc  6791",
    "provides perhaps the best opportunity for detailed studies of old and metal - rich populations . despite a rich array of extant photometric and spectroscopic studies ,",
    "however , the basic knowledge of cluster membership by kinematic means has been limited until now to radial velocities of a few dozen bright stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and preliminary proper motions for a few thousand stars @xcite .",
    "ngc  6791 is located in the field of view ( fov ) of nasa s _ kepler _ mission @xcite and is one of the targets of the kepler open cluster study @xcite .",
    "it is also one of the clusters in the wiyn open cluster study @xcite  again , largely owing to its extreme properties .",
    "this letter presents the highlights of a new and comprehensive proper - motion study of ngc 6791 , based upon the selection of exquisite deep photographic plates in combination with a decade of ccd imaging .",
    "the resulting proper motions provide nearly definite cluster membership for stars brighter than @xmath122 and , thus , unveil most of the cluster s population with unprecedented clarity .",
    "ngc  6791 is a rich but faint star cluster with a main - sequence turnoff at @xmath1617.5 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sbg ) , thus requiring relatively long exposures even with 34  m class telescopes . fortunately , there are deep photographic plates dating back to 1961 .",
    "we selected the best 33 plates ( assessed by the depth and sharpness of images ) taken with the lick 3  m and the kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) 4  m telescopes .",
    "these plates were digitised using the space telescope science institute s gamma  ii multi - channel scanning microdensitometer .",
    "the second epoch includes 66 frames obtained with the noao ccd mosaic imager at the kpno 4  m telescope in 1999 - 2007 .",
    "the finest 24 ccd mosaic frames in @xmath0 filters ( 1 , 30 , and 300  s exposures ) were obtained in 2009 november with megacam at the 3.6  m canada - france - hawaii telescope .",
    "these frames served for construction of a master catalog consisting of 128,771 objects down to @xmath125 and over an fov of 1 deg@xmath17 .",
    "we put positions on the system of the ucac3 catalog @xcite and calculated proper motions on this system using the iterative central - plate - overlap algorithm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the final catalog contains a total of 58,901 objects down to @xmath123.8 over a smaller area of @xmath60.8 deg@xmath18 , defined by a circular fov ( with radius 30 ) of the kpno photographic plates .",
    "the highest precision of our proper motions is 0.08 mas  yr@xmath3 .",
    "cluster membership probabilities are calculated using the frequency functions for cluster and field stars , obtained in selected magnitude and spatial ranges .",
    "discrimination between cluster members and field stars is excellent down to @xmath122 .",
    "details of the astrometric reductions and the description of the catalog itself will appear elsewhere ( platais et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .    for photometry",
    ", we used only the megacam images in @xmath0 filters .",
    "the central part of ngc  6791 is fairly crowded , often resulting in blended images .",
    "we note that all megacam images are preprocessed with elixir which , besides the standard steps , also normalizes the instrumental photometric zeropoint between the chips ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the short , 1  s exposures obtained in subarcsecond seeing were instrumental in constructing an initial catalog of positions and aperture photometry ( mag_auto magnitudes from sextractor ) .",
    "magnitudes from longer exposures were added only if they matched specified tolerances on position and magnitude . in this way it was possible to minimize the deleterious effects of image blending .",
    "nevertheless , image blending and ccd chip edge effects may occasionally yield stellar colors that are significantly off .",
    "our instrumental photometry was put into the standard @xmath0 system by employing the extant secondary photometric sequence in ngc  6791 @xcite .",
    "the rms error of the calibrating fits is 0.02 mag . on average , a calibrated @xmath19 magnitude near the main - sequence turnoff of ngc  6791",
    "is @xmath60.41  mag fainter than that in @xmath20 .",
    "one of the most comprehensive photometric surveys of ngc  6791 is that by sbg , who also provide extensive lists of bright stars , red giants , and faint blue stars in this cluster  all possible or likely members .",
    "now , we are in a position to provide nearly definite star - by - star kinematic membership , with a caveat that stars with blended images may not appear in our proper motion catalog or , if they do , may be biased .",
    "an example of such a case is the eclipsing binary v20  a definite cluster member @xcite but incorrectly classed as a field star in our catalog .",
    "its measured proper motion is apparently corrupted by the adjacent star ( @xmath21=2@xmath22 ) in the amount of @xmath66@xmath23 .",
    "the cmd in figure  1 shows the cleanest and the most complete census of ngc  6791 to date .",
    "it contains all stars with cluster membership probability @xmath2419% , as well as stars with @xmath25% but located on the main sequence , all within a radius @xmath26 from the cluster center  very close to that adopted by @xcite .",
    "the cluster membership probabilities for peripheral members of ngc  6791 ( @xmath27 ) are less reliable because of the overwhelming number of field stars and numerical instabilities in finding the cluster population .",
    "hence , in this region the selection of cluster members is limited to stars that are on the main sequence and have @xmath282% . from the combined cmd we deleted all stars below the main sequence and with @xmath29 , except for a few very blue stars with @xmath30% .",
    "likewise , all stars with @xmath31 and located well above the main sequence and to the right of the rgb were eliminated .",
    "this leaves us with a total of 5699 probable cluster members .      the most prominent part of the horizontal branch ( hb)the red clump  contains 26 now kinematically - confirmed stars , consistent with the photometric selection by @xcite .",
    "more exciting is the presence of extreme horizontal branch ( ehb ) stars in ngc  6791 , first recognized by @xcite .",
    "the following ehb stars are kinematic cluster members : b1, ... ,b7 , b9 ( names from * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a much fainter star , b8 , has a marginal @xmath32=10% ; however , its astrometry has large uncertainties and therefore we consider it to be a possible cluster member .",
    "in addition , star b16 ( @xmath32=59% ) appears to be a cluster member and the following sbg stars are likely cluster members as well : s3472 ( @xmath32=98% ) , s13881 ( @xmath32=60% ) . the brightest uv - source , b10",
    ", @xcite is a definite field star . in table  1",
    "we provide two new ehb stars in ngc  6791 , located at @xmath33 .",
    "besides new ehb candidates , table  1 lists a number of probable cluster members that we argue are classical hb stars .",
    "the bluest of these is the well - studied star 2 - 17 @xcite , which is frequently assigned to the ehb .",
    "an intriguing feature of the hb here is an upturn at its red end .",
    "this could be the effect of duplicity among the red clump stars , although that may not be the only interpretation .",
    "we stress that proving the reality of the hb in ngc  6791 depends critically upon the ability to distinguish hb stars from blue stragglers .",
    "there is one very bright star , s12158 ( @xmath1311.96 @xmath341.24 ) , which is formally a probable cluster member ( @xmath3591% ) but defies classification .",
    "based on its possibly abnormally high luminosity , we consider it provisionally to be a field star .",
    "m67 is the first open cluster where the so - called sub - subgiants were discovered @xcite .",
    "these apparent binary stars occupy an area of the cmd below the subgiant branch , which is not easy to populate with any combination of two normal cluster stars . owing to the low frequency of field stars in this part of the cmd , we are confident that at least five likely sub - subgiants are present in ngc  6791 . in the notation of sbg",
    ", these are : s83 , s746 , s3626 , s13753 , and s15561 .",
    "three of these are also the known variable stars v17 , v59 , and 01431_10 listed by @xcite .",
    "only star v17 is in common with the alternative list of sub - subgiants ( red stragglers ) given by @xcite .",
    "the depth and spatial extent of our survey allow the derivation of a reliable luminosity function ( lf ) for the entire cluster down to @xmath36 .",
    "the only omissions are secondaries in binary stars and severe blends .",
    "we have counted all stars from the cropped cmd ( figure  1 ) in 0.5 mag bins , in two ways : star - by - star and by weighting each star with its membership probability ( figure  2 ) . to translate @xmath19 into @xmath37 ,",
    "an apparent distance modulus of 13.56 was applied .",
    "the peak at @xmath38 and the smooth downward trend toward fainter magnitudes is unmistakable .",
    "it is consistent with the appearance of the lf in @xcite , although we can not replicate the flattening of their lf at @xmath39even less so , the flat luminosity functions provided in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a total of @xmath61000 cluster members per 1  mag bin around the main - sequence turnoff ( @xmath40 ) in our present sample is a record high among the known old galactic open clusters .",
    "we constructed a ( number ) surface - density profile for ngc 6791 using the 4830 stars in figure  1 brighter than @xmath41 ( where the proper - motion discrimination between cluster members and field stars is best ) .",
    "this is shown in figure  3 .",
    "the filled circles in this plot show the number of stars per unit area , as a function of projected cluster - centric radius , defined by adding up stars weighted by their membership probabilities in a series of concentric circular annuli .",
    "the open circles result from adding up the total numbers of the same stars directly , without weighting by @xmath42 .",
    "we fitted a single - mass , isotropic @xcite model to the @xmath42-weighted density profile in figure  3 , using only the data inside @xmath43 to constrain the fit .",
    "this implies a rather low central concentration for the cluster : @xmath44 , corresponding to a dimensionless central king potential , @xmath45 .",
    "the best - fitting king scale radius is @xmath46 , which , given the low fitted concentration , implies a projected core ( half - power ) radius of @xmath47 .",
    "the associated tidal radius is @xmath48 , and the effective ( projected `` half - mass '' ) radius is @xmath49 ( it is normally the case that estimates of @xmath50 are more robust than those of other characteristic radii ) . for a distance of 4.0  kpc to ngc 6791 @xcite , @xmath51 ; thus , we have that the projected core radius of the cluster is @xmath52  pc ; the effective radius is @xmath53  pc ; and the fitted tidal radius is @xmath54  pc .",
    "fitting to various other number density profiles defined by both brighter and fainter magnitude cuts , and both weighted and not weighted by @xmath42 , yields results for @xmath55 , @xmath50 , and @xmath56 that are generally compatible with the range of values suggested by the numbers just given for the @xmath57 case .",
    "the same is true for fits to luminosity surface - density profiles defined by adding up the luminosities of all the stars in our series of annuli . in exploring these various definitions of the density profile",
    ", we saw a clear tendency for the inferred tidal radius ( and thus the concentration , @xmath58 ) to increase systematically  along with @xmath50 , to a lesser extent  as stars with fainter and fainter magnitudes were included to define the observed density profile .",
    "this is primarily because stars with @xmath5920 in our sample are somewhat depleted , relative to the brighter stars , in the innermost @xmath60@xmath61 of ngc 6791 .",
    "however , it is not clear whether this is a physical effect ( e.g. , due to mass segregation ) or an artifact of crowding and image blending in the core of the cluster .",
    "the total luminosity of all stars with @xmath57 in our catalogue is @xmath62@xmath63 ( assuming @xmath64  kpc , corrected for @xmath65  mag of extinction , and depending on whether or not the luminosities are weighted by @xmath42 ) . adopting a theoretical @xmath66 stellar mass - luminosity relation from the padova",
    "isochrones @xcite implies a total mass of @xmath7 for the observed stars .",
    "this is a lower limit to the cluster mass because we have not attempted corrections for stellar binarity or incompleteness .",
    "we note that , if a @xcite model with @xmath67 and @xmath68  pc accurately describes the internal mass profile of ngc 6791 , then the projected , one - dimensional velocity dispersion averaged within the effective radius should be @xmath69 .",
    "this corresponds to an intrinsic proper - motion dispersion of @xmath70 , which is much smaller than the formal uncertainties in our proper motions .",
    "it is also significantly lower than the radial - velocity dispersion of @xmath71 reported for about a dozen red giants by @xcite , suggesting either that the @xcite dispersion may be spuriously high , or that ngc 6791 may not be in virial equilibrium .",
    "perhaps related to the second option , we note that a 5000 @xmath72 cluster in a galactic orbit with a pericenter of @xmath73  kpc and an apocenter of @xmath74  kpc @xcite is expected to have a tidal radius of @xmath75 at pericenter , and @xmath76 at apocenter  as against a value of @xmath77 suggested by our king - model fitting of ngc 6791 .",
    "deciding the true dynamical state of this cluster will require much more comprehensive and higher - precision proper - motion and radial - velocity surveys , to obtain the tightest possible constraints on its orbit and to delineate accurately its internal kinematics .",
    "even a casual inspection of the cluster s cmd reveals an unusually broad rgb  on the order of @xmath780.1 mag , while the formal uncertainties in the colors of these stars do not exceed @xmath60.02 mag .",
    "there is a variety of potential sources of increased scatter in the cmd , such as instrumental effects including the limitations of aperture photometry in crowded fields , presence of field stars , differential reddening , binarity of stars , metallicity variations , and possible effects on color / luminosity of rgb stars by variable mass loss suggested by @xcite .",
    "our proper - motion - vetted cmd offers a better look at the morphology of the rgb , which is more sensitive to differential reddening than the main sequence ( apart from its turnoff region ) .",
    "in addition , our sample covers the largest area ever considered , thus enhancing the chances of finding the signs of differential reddening .",
    "unfortunately , we can not take advantage of significantly reduced reddening effects in the near infrared .",
    "there is a poorly understood scatter in the @xmath79 color of our rgb stars from either 2mass or @xcite , which prevents us from using this color as a nearly reddening - free reference .",
    "instead , we examined the morphology of the rgb branch in @xmath80 cmd using approximately equal numbers of inner and outer probable cluster members by dividing the cluster at @xmath815@xmath2 .",
    "then , we draw a ridge line for the inner sample , encompassing subgiants and rgb stars ; see figure  4 .",
    "the majority of rgb stars at @xmath82 are bluer than this ridge line but , surprisingly , nearly all rgb stars at @xmath83 are redder than the ridge line of the inner sample .",
    "the shift in rgb color between the inner and outer samples is @xmath84  mag , whereas the age difference of 1  gyr suggested by @xcite would produce only a @xmath60.01 mag color shift in @xmath85 across the rgb region @xcite .",
    "we conjecture that this color shift , at least in part , is due to differential reddening . among the effects listed above",
    ", it is the only physical effect known to have an undeniable spatial dependency .",
    "our data provide evidence that differential reddening may not be ignored across the face of ngc  6791 .",
    "further advancements in our understanding of such a small effect require accurate near - infrared photometry and reliable identification of binaries in the upper part of the cmd .",
    "this study provides a comprehensive and clean list of cluster members in one of the astrophysically most important galactic star clusters .",
    "we hope that our findings in ngc  6791 and excellent cluster membership will stimulate in - depth future studies of individual cluster members .",

    "we thank the referee barbara anthony - twarog for pointing out the limitations of our data .",
