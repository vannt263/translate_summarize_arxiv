    "particles which contain strange quarks are valuable probes of the dynamics of @xmath4 collisions as constituent strange quarks are not present in the initial colliding nuclei .",
    "the enhancement of the strange particle yield from @xmath4 collisions to heavy ion collisions has been suggested as a possible quark gluon plasma signature @xcite .",
    "+ we report preliminary results from the 2001/2002 p+p run by the star experiment .",
    "the main focus of this paper is on presenting a high statistics measurement of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 at @xmath5 gev and obtaining the yield and @xmath0 for each species .",
    "a discussion of appropriate parameterizations to the particle spectra will ensue .",
    "we will show that the widely used power - law extrapolation in @xmath6 collisions is not sufficient to obtain the best @xmath7 results for fits to the strange particle spectra and we will consider alternatives@xcite .",
    "+ furthermore , we will study the dependency of @xmath8 and spectral shape as a function of charged particle event multiplicity(@xmath9 ) , an effect that has been observed previously in high energy @xmath6 collisions .",
    "several authors ascribe this phenomenon to pqcd mini - jets fragmenting into hadronic final states @xcite .",
    "however , we show that present string models incorporating semi - hard pqcd processes , such as pythia , do not describe the star data well without significant parameter tuning @xcite .",
    "the data were reconstructed using the star detector system which is described in more detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the main tracking detector used in this analysis is the time projection chamber ( tpc ) covering the full acceptance in azimuth and a large pseudo - rapidity coverage ( @xmath10 ) . +",
    "a total of 14 million non - singly diffractive ( nsd ) events were triggered with the star beam - beam counters ( bbc ) requiring two coincident charged tracks at forward rapidity ( @xmath11 ) . due to the particulary low track multiplicity environment in p+p collisions",
    "a special vertex finder was developed .",
    "a monte - carlo study showed that only 76% of primary vertices are found correctly ; from the remainder , 14% are lost and 10% are badly reconstructed .",
    "a total of 11 million events passed the event level selection criteria requiring a valid primary vertex within 100 cm along the beam - line from the center of the tpc detector .",
    "an additional multiplicity dependant vertex efficiency factor @xmath12 must therefore be applied to the particle spectra .",
    "+ the high luminosity of the rhic proton beams has the unfortunate effect of producing several collisions during the read - out time of the tpc , a condition known as  pile - up \" .",
    "these pile - up events can not be identified separately , however the triggered vertex can be identified by allowing only tracks that match to a very fast scintillating central trigger barrel(ctb ) detector to be used in the vertex reconstruction .",
    "the strange particles were identified from their weak decay to charged daughter particles via topological identification algorithm .",
    "the following decay channels were analyzed : @xmath13(b.r .",
    "63.9% ) , @xmath14(b.r .",
    "63.9% ) , @xmath15 ( b.r .",
    "+ particle identification of daughters was achieved by requiring the de / dx to fall within the 3@xmath16-bands of the theoretical bethe - bloch parameterizations .",
    "further background in the invariant mass was removed by applying topological cuts to the decay geometry , _ i.e. _ requiring the parent to originate from within 2 cm of the primary vertex and have a minimum decay length of 2 cm .",
    "these cuts also ensure that the particle decay is matched to the correct vertex with a high probability .",
    "+ corrections for particle reconstruction efficiency were obtained through a monte - carlo based method of embedding simulated particle decays into real events and comparing the number of simulated and reconstructed particles in each @xmath17-bin .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath3 spectra were corrected for feed - down from @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) . finally , the corrected transverse momentum spectra have to be multiplied by the multiplicity dependant primary vertex efficiency @xmath12 to account for yield losses .",
    "non - feeddown corrected spectra for @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are shown in figure [ fig : allspec ] .",
    "the particle acceptance at mid - rapidity ( @xmath20 ) in the tpc starts at transverse momentum 0.2 gev / c for @xmath1 and 0.3 gev / c for @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the spectra are parameterized to allow extrapolation to low pt and to extract @xmath0 and yield ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "in contrast to previous @xmath6 experiments @xcite , which used either a single exponential function in transverse mass or power - law functions , we found that a combination of these functions is more effective in fitting the star data .",
    "the @xmath7 results from different fit - functions are presented in table [ tab : fits1 ] .",
    "composite fits , represented in equation 1 ( for @xmath1 ) and equation 2 ( for @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) yield the lowest @xmath7 and were used to extract the final values for @xmath22 and yield as shown in table [ tab : results1 ] .",
    ".a summary of @xmath7 values for different fit - functions to the particle spectra [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "figure [ fig : spectrapythia ] shows the comparison of the star spectra to the spectra from the default setting of pythia event generator ( version 6.22 , msel1 ) which includes hard processes and a modelling of soft processes , through a pqcd model .    even at @xmath23 1.5 ,",
    "a regime were pqcd should give a better description , the differences between the model and the data are considerably large .",
    "further studies are planned in order to optimally tune the model to match the star strangeness data .",
    "the minimum bias event sample was split into 6 event classes according to mean charged particle multiplicity per unit @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "a similar analysis has been performed in previous @xmath6 experiments at different collision energies @xcite .",
    "high multiplicity events are particularly interesting as they are likely dominated by contributions from large momentum transfer parton - parton collisions .",
    "figure [ fig : meanptpythia ] presents a comparison of the @xmath22 vs @xmath25 for @xmath2 and @xmath1 with the corresponding pythia calculations . a rise in @xmath0 with increasing @xmath9",
    "is observed and is stronger for the heavier particle ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "several authors have attributed these phenomena to the increased number of fragmenting mini - jets in the high - multiplicity events @xcite .",
    "in fact , the hijing model even makes a prediction for the expected number of mini - jets contributing to each multiplicity @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting that pythia under - predicts the magnitude and correlation strength of @xmath0 with multiplicity .",
    "similar comparisons for inclusive charged particles @xmath0 have been recently published by the cdf collaboration and demonstrate similar discrepancies @xcite .",
    "in figure [ fig : meanptmass ] the @xmath0 is shown for all particle species measured in @xmath4 collisions in star as a function of particle mass .",
    "the black line is an empirical parameterization to isr data for @xmath26,k , p only , at @xmath27 = 25 gev .",
    "there is very little energy dependance for the lower mass particles between the isr and rhic energies , whereas the higher mass particles show a clear breaking from the parameterization .",
    "the dependance of @xmath0 on particle mass has been explained by mini - jet production in @xmath4 and @xmath6 collisions and a stronger contribution for higher mass particles is expected @xcite .",
    "the star experiment has made the first high statistics measurement of mid - rapidity @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 in @xmath4 collisions at @xmath27 = 200 gev .",
    "the results agree with those made by the ua5 collaboration for @xmath6 at @xmath27 = 200 gev .",
    "the ratio of @xmath3/@xmath2 suggests a small net baryon number at mid - rapidity .",
    "we have show that the shape of the particle spectra is best described with a two - component fit function accounting for both the soft and hard parts of the spectra .",
    "furthermore , we have undertaken studies to understand the change in shape and @xmath0 of the spectra with increased event multiplicity .",
    "we compared our results to pqcd inspired models which infer mini - jets and string fragmentation .",
    "we have shown that the current default version of pythia is not well tuned for strange particles at this collision energy .",
