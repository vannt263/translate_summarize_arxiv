    "the hcn ( sma+jcmt)/hc@xmath2n ( sma ) line intensity ratio toward source a is @xmath0 4 , which implies an optical depth of @xmath31 for the hc@xmath2n line assuming an n@xmath32/n@xmath2 isotopic ratio of 270 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the hc@xmath2n line is likely to be optically thin .",
    "the redshifted self - absorption in the hcn spectra against the continuum at source a could be a sign of the inward motion toward the continuum source @xcite , although the presence of the extended hcn absorption in the entire region ( see figure 4 ) implies significant contamination from extended low - temperature material .",

    "the hcn emission also shows extensions to the north - west and to the north - east of source a in addition to this compact structure .",
    "importantly , the combined hcn image shows that all of these features are surrounded by a halo component with a size of @xmath0 3000  au , demonstrating that the sma is not sensitive to the extended structure .",

    "after this velocity the redshifted halo component appears again . from @xmath29 @xmath0 6.5 a compact gas component toward source a is seen , which corresponds to the redshifted counterpart of the compact structure at source a.    in order for us to see the systematic velocity structures more clearly , we integrated these velocity channel maps into four different velocity regimes , that is , low - velocity blueshifted ( 2.5  3.4 km s@xmath17 ) and redshifted ( 5.0  6.5 km s@xmath17 ) , and high - velocity blueshifted ( -2.6  0.7 km s@xmath17 ) and redshifted ( 7.4  9.1 km s@xmath17 ) emission . in figure 5 , we compare these four hcn velocity channel maps to the co ( 21 ) maps taken with the sma @xcite , integrated into the same four velocity regimes . the spatial resolution in the co ( 21 )",

    "the hcn emission shows extensions as well as the compact structures associated with source a. the comparison with the co maps shows that the hcn extensions have distributions similar to those of co , particularly at the high redshifted velocity .",

    "( 2007 ) , source a is the most likely to be driving the e - w co outflow , while the driving source of the nw - se outflow remains uncertain . in the optically - thin hc@xmath2n emission ,",
    "the high - velocity blueshifted and redshifted components exhibit a velocity gradient along the minor axis ( p.a .",

    "the velocity gradient along the minor axis is approximately parallel to the e - w co outflow , though the position angle of the e - w co outflow can not be well - defined due to the wide opening angle . although the direction of the minor axis of the compact hcn emission is slightly different from that of the compact hc@xmath2n emission , the direction of the velocity gradient in the hcn emission is similar to that of the hc@xmath2n emission .",
    "one possible interpretation of the observed velocity gradient in the compact flattened structure is outflowing gas , because both the co outflow and the hcn / hc@xmath2n emission show the same trend of velocity gradient .",
    "in fact , the extended hcn emission is strongly affected by the molecular outflow , as has been discussed in the previous section",
    ". the slight difference of the position angle between the compact hcn and hc@xmath2n component is also likely to be due to the contamination from the extended component .",
    "however , the optically - thin hc@xmath2n emission , which should be less affected by the extended outflow component , is clearly elongated in a different direction from the outflow direction ( figure 5 and 6 ) , suggesting that the velocity gradient is unlikely to be due to the outflow .",
    "we interpret the observed velocity gradients in the hcn and hc@xmath2n emission to be an infalling gas motion in the flattened disklike structure toward source a @xcite .    in the left panel of figure 7 , we show position - velocity ( p - v ) diagrams along the minor axis of the hc@xmath2n compact emission at source a ( see figure 6 ) , in the hcn emission with the sma - only ( gray ) and sma+jcmt ( black contour ) , and in the hc@xmath2n emission with the sma ( red contour ) . in the p - v diagrams ,",
    "both the hcn and hc@xmath2n lines trace the higher - velocity emission located close to source a , and this velocity structure corresponds to the compact emission at source a. we made a number of model p - v diagrams of a geometrically thin disk with gaussian intensity distribution to reproduce this component , one of which is shown in the right panel of figure 7 . from the estimated major and minor axis in the sma hc@xmath2n image we estimated the inclination angle of the flattened structure from the plane of the sky to be @xmath0 57(@xmath24 cos@xmath17(maj / min ) ) , and we adopted this inclination in the model p - v diagram .",
    "we also assumed the internal velocity dispersion ( @xmath24 @xmath30 ) to be 1.0 km s@xmath17 @xcite . on these assumptions , we made model p - v diagrams with different central masses , and the model p - v diagram in figure 7 shows that the compact high - velocity emission could be interpreted as an infalling disk onto the central stellar mass of @xmath0 1 m@xmath4 with an acceptable mass range from @xmath0 0.5 m@xmath4 to @xmath0 2.0 m@xmath4 .",

    "these estimates are roughly consistent with our estimates ( @xmath0 57 , and @xmath0 1.0 m@xmath4 ) , and the compact hcn structure detected with our observations can be interpreted as tracing the outer part of the same infalling disk . from the optically - thin hc@xmath2n emission , we estimated the mass of the compact structure within the radius of @xmath0 230 au ( @xmath24 @xmath40 ) to be 0.084 m@xmath4 ( @xmath24 @xmath41 ) . here",

    "the infalling velocity at that radius is 2.8 km s@xmath17 ( @xmath24 @xmath43 ) from our model .",

    "we suggest that only the compact hcn / hc@xmath2n component associated with source a is infalling , and we derived the mass accretion rate in the compact hcn component from our toy model .",

    "the reason of this discrepancy is still unclear .",
    "one possible explanation is that the infalling motion found in the present study is not onto the surface of the protostar itself , but onto the central rotationally - supported disk around the protostar . here",
    ", the radius of the terminal point in the gravitational potential is likely to be much larger than that adopted in the above estimates .",
    "if we assume the radius of the terminal point to be @xmath0 1 au , our estimated mass infalling rate is consistent with the bolometric luminosity .",
    "another possible explanation is that the accretion may be non - steady .",

    "( 2005 ) have interpreted the velocity gradient in the hc@xmath2n emission as a keplerian rotation around source a. however , the position angle of the flattened structure in the optically - thin line ( -16 ) as well as that of the inner rotating - infalling disk traced by the h@xmath33o maser @xcite , seems to favor the interpretation of the infalling motion .",
    "furthermore , the interpretation of the keplerian rotation implies that there is a well - developed 500 au scale rotationally - supported disk around the class 0 protostar with the significant molecular outflows . in general , such well - developed large - scale ( @xmath0 500 au ) keplerian disks are observed around more evolved sources , that is , class ii sources , as in the case of a circumbinary keplerian ring around gg tau @xcite and a keplerian protoplanetary disk around dm tau @xcite . from these considerations",

    "the velocity structure in this extended lower - velocity component is clearly different from that in the compact high - velocity component ; the velocity increases further from source a. since the cut of the p - v diagram is approximately parallel to the axis of the associated co outflow ( see figure 6 ) and this type of velocity gradients is expected in molecular outflows driven by the wide - angle wind , we suggest that this extended hcn emission arises from turbulent gas swept up by the associated outflow from source a. our simple thin - layer model with the gaussian intensity distribution shown in the right panel of figure 7 is consistent with the interpretation that this low - velocity component could be an outflowing gas perpendicular to the compact high - velocity structure .    in figure 8 ,",

    "these results imply that source a and b are at different evolutionary stages in the common circumbinary envelope , although it is unclear which source is younger . in terms of protostellar activity traced by molecular lines ,",
