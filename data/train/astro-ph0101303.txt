    "in a high - mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) a massive , ob - type star is orbited by a compact , accreting x - ray source : a neutron star or a black hole .",
    "mass is accreted either from the stellar wind of the massive companion ( resulting in a modest x - ray luminosity ) , or flows with a higher rate to the compact star when the massive star fills its roche lobe . in the latter case a much higher x - ray luminosity is achieved .",
    "two classes of hmxbs can be distinguished based on the nature of the massive star : ( i ) the ob - supergiant systems , and ( ii ) the be / x - ray binaries ( for a recent catalogue of hmxbs , see liu et al .",
    "the first class consists of the most massive systems , some of them containing a black hole ( e.g. cyg  x-1 ) .",
    "the second class comprises the majority ( @xmath080  % ) of the hmxbs ; most of them are detected as x - ray transients .",
    "the transient character is explained by the periodic increase in x - ray luminosity when the neutron star , in its eccentric orbit , passes through periastron and accretes from the dense equatorial be - star disk . in the remainder of this paper , we will concentrate on the ob - supergiant systems .",
    "hmxbs are the descendants of massive binaries in which the initially most massive star ( the primary ) has become a neutron star or a black hole ( van den heuvel & heise 1972 ; for extensive reviews on binary evolution , see e.g.  van den heuvel 1993 , vanbeveren et al .",
    "1998 ) . that the system remains bound after the supernova is due to a phase of mass transfer that occurs in the system when the primary grows larger than its roche lobe . as a consequence ,",
    "the secondary becomes the most massive of the two , so that with the supernova explosion of the primary less than half of the total system mass is lost and the system remains bound ( boersma 1961 ) .",
    "it is assumed here that the supernova explosion is symmetric ; in case of an asymmetry , the additional kick exerted on the compact remnant can cause the disruption of the system .",
    "anyway , due to the loss of material ( and momentum ) , the system gets a substantial `` runaway '' velocity ( blaauw 1961 ) : on the order of 50  km  s@xmath1 for the most massive systems ( and about 15  km  s@xmath1 for the less massive be / x - ray binaries , cf.van den heuvel et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "as long as the secondary is a massive main sequence star , accretion of its relatively tenuous stellar wind onto the compact companion does not result in an observable x - ray flux .",
    "only when the secondary becomes a supergiant and starts filling its roche lobe  this scenario refers to case  b binary evolution ; in case a the secondary fills its roche lobe already on the main sequence ",
    "the accretion flow is dense enough to power a strong x - ray source ; now the system has become a hmxb .",
    "this phase lasts for a relatively short period of time ( @xmath010,000 year ) : as soon as the roche - lobe overflow commences , the orbit will shrink leading to an even higher mass transfer rate and a further tightening of the orbit . at some point",
    ", the x - ray source will be completely swamped with material optically thick in x - rays and/or penetrate the mantle of the secondary , followed by a rapid spiral - in .",
    "when also the secondary explodes as a supernova , a neutron - star binary ( like the hulse - taylor binary pulsar ) or two single neutron stars remain .",
    "the detailed evolution of massive binaries is still a matter of debate ( e.g. wellstein & langer 1999 , and several contributions to these proceedings ) .",

    "we will discuss the observational consequences of the evolutionary scenario outlined above for the properties of high - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "firstly , we will compare the stellar parameters of the ob supergiants in hmxbs to those of single massive stars .",
    "these stars gained a significant fraction of their present mass from the progenitor of the x - ray source ; this matter likely is chemically enriched .",
    "not only matter , but also angular momentum is transfered .",
    "therefore , both the internal and the atmospheric properties of these ob stars might differ from those of single massive stars . secondly , the binarity of these systems provides the opportunity to measure fundamental parameters ( such as the mass ) of neutron stars and black holes .",
    "thirdly , the impact of the x - ray source on the structure of the ob - supergiant s wind is discussed .",
    "the x - ray source creates a strmgren zone of high ionization in which the radiative acceleration of the wind is quenched .",
    "this leads to the formation of a photo - ionization wake trailing the x - ray source in its orbit . in the most extreme case , only in the x - ray shadow",
    "a radiatively driven wind emerges : a so - called shadow wind .",
    "the last section deals with the runaway nature of hmxbs .",
    "although on theoretical grounds high space velocities are expected , the observational proof that hmxbs are runaway objects has just recently been obtained .",
    "hipparcos _ results indicate that both the binary supernova scenario and the cluster ejection mechanism produce ob - runaway stars .",
    "table  1 gives an overview of the ob - supergiant systems in the milky way and the magellanic clouds .",
    "the orbital periods range from 1.4 ( lmc  x-4 ) to 41.5  days ( gx301 - 2 ) . a relatively long pulse period ( minutes )",
    "indicates that the x - ray source is a neutron star in a wind - fed system .",
    "the roche - lobe overflow systems ( e.g. cen  x-3 ) host rapid x - ray pulsars , most likely surrounded by an accretion disk . in these systems",
    "not only more mass , but also more angular momentum is transfered to the x - ray source , explaining the high ( eddington ) x - ray luminosity and rapid spin period .",
    "figure  1 shows the distribution of the sample of ob supergiants in hmxbs ( table  1 ) in the hertzsprung - russell diagram .",
    "the spectral type of the ob supergiant is used to determine the effective temperature of the star and to estimate the interstellar reddening . with the latter ,",
    "an estimate of the distance , and the bolometric correction ( which also depends on the spectral type ) , the luminosity is derived . for several systems",
    "the distance is known with reasonable accuracy , especially the magellanic cloud systems and systems for which a parent ob association has been identified (   5 ) . for comparison ,",
    "the evolutionary tracks of ( single ) massive stars are drawn in ( lejeune & schaerer 2000 ) , which take into account the stellar - wind mass loss .",
    "the mass on the zero - age main sequence is indicated ( and the reduced mass due to mass loss is displayed at some locations along the tracks ) .",
    "the mass of the ob supergiant in a hmxb can be accurately measured when the system hosts an x - ray pulsar . with the delay in pulse - arrival time and the radial - velocity curve of the ob supergiant the orbits of both stars",
    "are determined , and thereby their masses if the orbital inclination is known .",
    "the latter is well constrained if the system is eclipsing . in those systems , also the radius of the ob supergiant can be derived with high precision from the duration of the x - ray eclipse .",
    "the masses and radii are listed in table  1 . the mass ratio sets the size of the roche lobe ( e.g.  eggleton 1983 ) ; it turns out that the measured radii of the ob supergiants are in very good agreement with the estimated size of the roche lobe .    earlier studies ( e.g.  conti 1978 , rappaport & joss 1983 ) suggested that the ob supergiants in hmxbs are too luminous for their mass",
    "this is clearly demonstrated in figure  1 : e.g.  the o6.5 giant companion of cen  x-3 has a mass of 19  m@xmath6 , while its luminosity corresponds to that of a star of more than 50  m@xmath6 . besides this , the radius corresponding to the luminosity and effective temperature ( r@xmath13 ) is larger than its measured ( roche - lobe ) radius .",
    "thus , apart from being undermassive , the ob supergiants in hmxbs also seem to be _",
    "undersized _ for their luminosity and temperature .",
    "figure  2 shows that the ob supergiants ( in systems with an eclipsing x - ray pulsar ) with the largest deviation in radius , are also the most `` undermassive '' ones .",
    "the wind - fed system 4u1700 - 37 is eclipsing , but the x - ray source is not pulsating ; the measured radius of its o6.5  iaf companion is in good agreement with r@xmath13 , but the supergiant s mass can not be accurately determined . for a similar reason , the non - eclipsing hmxbs hosting an x - ray pulsar are not included in fig .  2 , because the radius is not well known .",
    "however , the effective temperature of a star is determined by its luminosity and size .",
    "apparently , the spectral type  effective temperature calibration of single stars can not be applied to the ob supergiants in hmxbs ( presuming that the distances to these objects are not systematically too large ) .",
    "for the five objects in fig .  2 , the deviation in radius and mass is worst for the stars with earliest spectral type , but this might be a coincidence ( e.g. 4u1700 - 37 has an o6.5 companion , but has r@xmath13/r@xmath14 close to one ) .",
    "the discrepancy between r@xmath13 and r@xmath14 can be removed by systematically increasing t@xmath13 by 10 - 25  % , while keeping the luminosity constant ( the bolometric correction does not change very much ) .",
    "but this does not explain why the stars are undermassive .",
    "probably the trend observed in fig .  2",
    "is related to the phenomenon of roche - lobe overflow .",
    "the ob star tries to become a supergiant , but at some point reaches its critical roche lobe and starts to transfer mass to its companion .",
    "while the luminosity of the star is determined by the core ( which does not notice much of what is happening to the outer mantle ) , the star likes to be bigger than allowed by its roche lobe and is peeled off .",
    "this would explain why systems like vela  x-1 ( and 4u1700 - 37 , gx301 - 2 ) which are wind - fed x - ray sources not ( yet ) experiencing roche - lobe overflow , are not showing large discrepancies in mass and radius .    regarding the chemical enrichment of the massive stars in hmxbs , a thorough analysis is still lacking .",
    "the ultraviolet spectrum of hd77581 , the companion of vela  x-1 , shows very strong n  v and al  iii resonance lines , typical for nitrogen enhanced b stars , the bn stars ( kaper et al . 1993 ) .",
    "atmospheric models of hde226868 , the o supergiant companion of cyg  x-1 , by herrero et al .",
    "( 1995 ) indicate a helium abundance higher than expected for its evolutionary state ( a helium discrepancy , assuming single star evolution ) .",
    "however , according to herrero et al .",
    "( 1992 ) also rapid rotators and very luminous stars , of which several are single , show helium enhancement .",
    "blaauw ( 1993 ) and hoogerwerf et al . ( 2000 ) used these findings to suggest that the helium enhancement and rapid rotation are observational characteristics of ob runaways ; unfortunately , we are still dealing with small - number statistics .",
    "the accurate measurement of neutron - star masses is essential for our understanding of the equation of state ( eos ) of matter at supra - nuclear densities , and of the mechanism of core collapse of massive stars .",
    "the eos can , so far , only be studied on the basis of theoretical models .",
    "these remain very uncertain and subject to hot dispute .",
    "brown & bethe ( 1994 ) have strongly argued that the eos must be `` soft '' , i.e. , that matter would be relatively compressible , due to kaon condensation ( kaons are bosons which do not contribute to the fermi pressure ) . heavy ion collision experiments ( in hamburg , desy ) confirm their predictions , but at densities still quite a bit lower than those appropriate for neutron stars .",
    "if the theory were correct , one of the astrophysical implications would be that neutron stars can not have a mass larger than 1.55  m@xmath6 ; for larger masses , the object would collapse into a black hole .",
    "the masses of x - ray pulsars ( table  1 ) can also be used to test the predictions of supernova models .",
    "for instance , timmes et al .",
    "( 1996 ) present model calculations from which they find that type  ii supernovae ( massive , single stars ) give a bimodal compact - object mass distribution , with peaks at 1.28 and 1.73 m@xmath6 , while type  ib supernovae ( such as produced by stars in binaries , which are stripped of their envelopes ) will produce neutron stars within a small range around 1.32  m@xmath6 .",
    "the massive neutron star in vela  x-1 with a mass of @xmath15  m@xmath6 would be consistent with the second peak in this distribution ( barziv et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "presently , all accurate mass determinations besides that of vela  x-1 have been for neutron stars that were almost certainly formed from type ib supernovae and that have accreted little since .",
    "the most accurate have been derived for the binary radio pulsars .",
    "all of these are consistent with a small range near @xmath16 ( thorsett & chakrabarty 1999 ) .",
    "that this mass is so close to the chandrasekhar mass is thought to be due to the maximum mass of the degenerate iron core , just before supernova .",
    "apparently , the supernova explosion in this case prevents additional material from accretion onto the proto - neutron star , thus also preventing the formation of a black hole .",
    "however , the ( binary ) radio pulsars are likely to originate from binaries of moderate mass which might not be able to produce massive neutron stars , nor black holes",
    ". this would be consistent with the observed absence of black holes in be / x - ray binaries . if massive neutron stars exist , they are more likely to have formed in systems of high initial mass .",
    "these systems are capable of producing black holes , thus a fall - back mechanism must exist ( because these stars will also have a degenerate iron core before collapse ) .",
    "the alternative is that black holes are not produced by normal supernovae but in gamma - ray bursts ( hypernovae ) , such as sn1998bw / grb980425 ( galama et al .",
    "1998 , iwamoto et al . 1998 ) .",
    "our hypothesis is that when a fall - back mechanism exists , the masses of neutron stars in the most massive hmxbs will be evenly distributed over a relatively large mass interval , up to a maximum mass set by the neutron star equation of state . alternatively ,",
    "black holes are produced in gamma - ray bursts , and massive neutron stars like in vela  x-1 are explained by the second of the two peaks in the mass distribution such as predicted by timmes et al .",
    "the x - ray source ionizes a significant fraction of the ambient stellar wind ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "the presence of a strmgren zone in the system becomes apparent from the orbital modulation of strong ultraviolet resonance lines ( e.g.  from n  v , si  iv , and c  iv , cf .",
    "kaper et al .",
    "1993 ) formed in the stellar wind .",
    "when the x - ray source is in the line of sight ( @xmath17 ) , the blue - shifted absorption part of the p - cygni profile is strongly reduced in strength , because ions like c  iv are removed by the x - rays .",
    "the orbital modulation of uv resonance lines is observed in most hmxbs with ob supergiant companion for which ultraviolet spectra are available .",
    "however , in hd153919/4u1700 - 37 , the system for which hatchett & mccray ( 1978 ) originally predicted this effect , the p - cygni profiles do not vary with orbital phase . when the non - monotonic velocity structure of the stellar wind is taken into account ,",
    "the absence of the hm - effect in 4u1700 - 37 can be explained ( van loon et al .",
    "2001 ) . for a review on stellar winds in hmxbs , see kaper ( 1998 ) .",
    "a consequence of the high degree of ionization inside the strmgren zone is that in this region the radiative acceleration is quenched .",
    "the highly ionized plasma becomes effectively transparent for ultraviolet photons emitted by the ob companion that accelerate the stellar wind .",
    "due to the revolution of the system , the stagnant flow inside the ionization zone meets the rapidly accelerating stellar wind at the trailing border . here",
    ", a strong shock is formed ( fig .",
    "3 ) , the so - called photo - ionization wake ( blondin et al .",
    "the relatively large extent of the photo - ionization wake results in an observable blue - shifted absorption feature in strong optical lines at late orbital phases ( kaper et al .",
    "1994 ) .    the roche - lobe overflow systems ( smc  x-1 , lmc  x-4 , cen  x-3 ) contain a very strong x - ray source .",
    "the x - ray luminosity approaches the bolometric luminosity of the ob companion , so that the x - ray flux dominates the ionization equilibrium in a large fraction of the stellar wind . actually , only in the x - ray shadow behind the ob companion a normal stellar wind can develop , the shadow wind ( blondin 1994 ) .",
    "ultraviolet spectra of lmc  x-4 ( boroson et al . 1999 ) clearly show the presence of a shadow wind in this system .",
    "high - resolution uv spectra of lmc  x-4 obtained with hst / stis reveal the signature of a photo - ionization wake , there where the fast shadow wind rams into the highly ionized strmgren zone ( kaper et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the spin behaviour of the x - ray pulsar provides information on the accretion flow in the system . in roche - lobe overflow systems",
    "the x - ray pulsar is spun up due to the relatively high accretion rate and the corresponding transfer of angular momentum .",
    "the spin - up and spin - down episodes observed in some wind - fed systems ( e.g. vela  x-1 ) indicate that sometimes a small accretion disk is formed , the direction of rotation depending on details ( e.g. instability ) of the accretion flow ( blondin et al .",
    "variations in the accretion flow are also apparent from the strong x - ray flaring behaviour observed in hmxbs .",
    "about 20% of the o stars , and a smaller fraction of the b stars , have a space velocity much higher than observed on average for the ob - star population in the milky way ( about 10  km  s@xmath1 , stone 1979 ) .",
    "some ob stars have a space velocity exceeding 100  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "blaauw ( 1961 ) called these stars runaway stars , because at least for some of them the reconstructed path through space suggests an origin in a nearby ob association .",
    "how did these massive stars obtain such a high space velocity ?",
    "blaauw proposed that the supernova explosion of a massive companion in a binary results in a high velocity of the remaining massive star ; the `` modern '' version of this blaauw scenario is described in   1 , which predicts that all hmxbs are runaway systems .",
    "it took several decades to obtain the observational evidence proving that this scenario actually works ( van oijen 1989 , van rensbergen et al .",
    "1996 , kaper et al .",
    "1997 ) ; now , _ hipparcos _",
    "measurements have definitely confirmed the runaway nature of hmxbs ( chevalier & ilovaisky 1998 , kaper et al .",
    "1999 ) ; table  1 lists the derived space velocities .",
    "an alternative scenario for the formation of ob runaways is dynamical ejection from a compact cluster ( poveda et al .",
    "1967 , portegies zwart 2000 ) . due to the dynamical interaction between binaries ( and single stars ) , now and then a massive star is ejected from an ob association .",
    "the probability for ejection is higher in dense starclusters ; given the expansion of ob associations , one expects that dynamical ejection is most effective in young ob associations .",
    "an impressive example demonstrating the cluster ejection scenario is provided by the ob runaways ae  aur and @xmath18  col .",
    "blaauw & morgan ( 1954 ) noticed that these two stars move in almost opposite directions away from the ori  ob1 association and have the same kinematical age ( i.e. the travel time from the association to its present location ) . using _",
    "hipparcos _ observations , hoogerwerf et al .",
    "( 2000 ) managed to reconstruct the kinematical history of these two runaways in great detail and could show that both stars and the massive binary system @xmath19  ori were at the same place in ori  ob1 @xmath20 million years ago ( fig .",
    "the dynamical interaction between two binary systems apparently led to the disruption of one of them and the subsequent ejection of the two members ( in opposite directions due to momentum conservation ) .",
    "based on the _ hipparcos _ proper motion of hd153919 ( 4u1700 - 37 ) , ankay et al .",
    "( 2001 ) demonstrate that this hmxb very likely originates from the ob association sco  ob1 at a distance of 2  kpc ( fig .  5 ) .",
    "the kinematical age of the system is 2@xmath210.5  myr , which sets the time of the supernova producing the compact star in the system .",
    "the present age of sco  ob1 is 6@xmath212  myr ( the `` nucleus '' of the association , ngc  6231 , is probably younger ) .",
    "these observations can be used to derive a constraint on the initial mass of the progenitor of 4u1700 - 37 .",
    "the turn - off mass of a cluster of 4  myr is about 25  m@xmath6 .",
    "if the system was born as a member of ngc  6231 , the progenitor of 4u1700 - 37 likely was an even more massive star ( @xmath22  m@xmath6 ) .",
    "hoogerwerf et al .",
    "( 2000 ) studied the kinematical history of a sample of nearby runaways ( 17 ) and their ( candidate ) parent ob associations using _ hipparcos _ data .",
    "a comparison of the kinematical age of the runaway and the age of the cluster is used to discriminate between the two formation scenarios . in case of dynamical ejection",
    ", the kinematical age of the runaway should be about equal to the age of the association . in the binary supernova scenario ,",
    "the evolution of the binary system implies that the kinematical age of the runaway is significantly shorter than the age of the cluster .",
    "furthermore , the ob runaway will be a blue straggler in the hrd of the cluster , because the ob runaway is rejuvenated ( by gaining mass ) during the first phase of mass transfer in the system .",
    "hoogerwerf et al .",
    "conclude that the two mechanisms produce about equal amounts of runaways .",
    "this conclusion is in agreement with theoretical predictions ( e.g. de donder et al .",
    "1997 , portegies zwart 2000 ) .",
    "ob runaways can be used as probes of the interstellar medium ; their stellar wind interacts with the ambient medium reflecting the motion of the star .",
    "where the ram pressure of wind and interstellar medium balance , a wind bow shock is formed if the runaway is moving with a supersonic velocity .",
    "van buren et al . ( 1995 ) detected wind bow shocks around several ob runaways , with a detection rate of about 30  % .",
    "kaper et al .",
    "( 1997 ) discovered a wind bow shock around the hmxb vela  x-1 .",
    "huthoff & kaper ( 2001 ) searched for the presence of wind bow shocks around other hmxbs , but could not add a significant detection .",
    "the non - detection of wind bow shocks for the majority of runaways is likely related to the varying physical conditions of the ism .",
    "for example , inside a hot superbubble the sound speed is about 100  km  s@xmath1 , so that the runaway would not move supersonically and a bow shock is not formed .",
    "these superbubbles are created by the combined action of stellar winds and supernovae of the massive stars in ob associations .",
    "huthoff & kaper demonstrate that the ob runaways with a detected wind bow shock concentrate in regions in between superbubbles .",
