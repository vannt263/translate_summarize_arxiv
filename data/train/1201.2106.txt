    "one of the strongest motivations for studying low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) has been the aim to use these systems as probes of fundamental physics .",
    "it has been argued that the study of high frequency ( 40450  hz ) quasi - periodic oscillations ( hfqpos ) found in lmxbs containing a stellar mass black hole ( bh ) is one of the most promising tools to do so .",
    "the hfqpos are the fastest phenomenon observed in these systems and their high frequency suggests that they are produced in the innermost region of the accretion flow near the bh event horizon . once the processes involved in their formation are firmly understood , they will give a wealth of information on bh mass and spin as well as the structure of strongly curved spacetime ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "hfqpos are weak , transient , and energy dependent , and are mostly detected only at high count rates . in some cases",
    "they are found just above detection levels , so there is considerable uncertainty about their exact properties .",
    "however , typically the quality factor q ranges between less than 2 and a few tens , and amplitudes are between 0.5 and 5% rms ( depending on the source and the energy range used ) .",
    "twin qpos at a stable 300 hz and 450 hz @xcite have been observed in the bh gro j165540 ; at 240 and 160 hz in h1743322 @xcite and at 188 and 268 hz in xte j155056 ( note however , that in this case it is not clear how stable the frequency of these qpos is , see * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and relaxing the assumption on equal spin , we can identify the higher frequency ( 160 - 170 hz ) as representing a keplerian motion at a certain radius and , the lower frequency ( 66  hz ) as the relativistic periastron precession at the same radius ( notice that this radius must be larger than the isco , where the two frequencies are the same ) . to test this identification , we searched for the combinations between spin parameter and bh mass which allow a solution .",
    "we find solutions for masses ranging between 7  m@xmath43 ( for @xmath44 ) and 19  m@xmath43 ( for @xmath45 ) , the latter consistent with the @xmath5 and @xmath46 reported for grs  1915 + 105 @xcite .",
    "this identification implies that igr  j170913624 could be considerably less massive than grs  1915 + 105 ( and coincidentally have a much lower spin than grs  1915 + 105 ) , explaining in this way why the highest frequency of the heartbeats is significantly higher in igr  j170913624 than in grs  1915 + 105 @xcite .",
