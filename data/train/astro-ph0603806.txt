    "seyfert galaxies @xcite are the most luminous type of active galaxy found in the nearby ( @xmath2 ) universe .",
    "they have typical bolometric luminosities @xmath3 , with @xmath4 @xcite as the accepted criterion for distinguishing a seyfert nucleus from a quasar .",
    "their spectra are dominated by high - ionization atomic emission lines .",
    "@xcite showed that there are two distinct classes of seyfert galaxy : type 1 seyferts with broad ( fwhm @xmath5 ) permitted emission lines and superposed narrow ( fwhm @xmath6 ) emission lines from forbidden and permitted transitions ; while in type 2 seyferts broad permitted emission lines are absent . @xcite",
    "introduced further classifications from 1.2 to 1.9 with numerically larger types having weaker broad - line components relative to the narrow lines .",
    "using spectropolarimetry , @xcite noticed that in ngc 1068 the broad - line region can be seen in polarized light , leading to the idea that the nature of the central continuum source is similar in both types of seyferts .",
    "@xcite coined the term _ narrow - line seyfert 1s _ ( nls1 s ) to denote seyferts 1s with spectra generally like those of classical seyfert 1s ( strong fe  ii , [ o iii ] @xmath7 , @xmath8 relatively weak compared to hydrogen balmer series ) but with permitted line widths much narrower than typical seyfert 1s .",
    "@xcite specified that all nls1 s have fwhm(h@xmath9 ) @xmath10 , and this is now the currently accepted criterion to distinguish nls1 s from bls1 s .",
    "the emission characteristics of nls1 s place them on one extreme of eigenvector 1 of @xcite , which was determined from principal component analysis ( pca ) of a large sample of low - redshift agn .",
    "the pca analysis confirmed that strong fe  ii , weak [ o iii ] and narrow h@xmath9 lines are the defining characteristics of the nls1 class in the optical regime .",
    "the current widely accepted model for agn consists of a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) accreting matter via an accretion disk . for nls1 s",
    ", the current paradigm is that nls1 s possess black holes of relatively modest mass ( @xmath11 ) that are being fed at or close to the relative eddington accretion rate @xcite .",
    "this view is supported by recent observational results that indicate that nls1 s possess significantly smaller black hole masses than their broad - line counterparts @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the narrow - line widths are simply due to the smaller black hole mass .    in order to fuel agn",
    ", matter must be transported all the way from kiloparsec scales to the central engine .",
    "thus the matter must lose almost all of its angular momentum via some process .",
    "one possibility involves mergers or tidal interactions with neighboring galaxies @xcite .",
    "however studies of environments of seyfert galaxies show no evidence for a statistical excess in number of companion galaxies or any recent merger events @xcite in seyfert galaxies as compared to normal galaxies .",
    "another process that has received considerable attention is gas inflow along a galactic stellar bar @xcite .",
    "however most observational studies have found similar fraction of bars in seyferts and normal galaxies @xcite .",
    "since there is strong evidence that most normal galaxies contain inactive smbh @xcite , this indicates that while gas may be transported to the inner kiloparsec via large - scale stellar bars , there are other factors that contribute to the presence of nuclear activity .",
    "@xcite proposed the bar - within - bar fueling scenario , where the secondary gas / dust bar develops due to non - axisymmetric instabilities in the gas disk within the inner kiloparsec .",
    "@xcite found evidence for gas motion along a secondary bar - like structure within @xmath12 of the central engine in the seyfert 2 circinus galaxy .",
    "however it appears that either gaseous / dusty secondary bars are fairly rare among seyfert galaxies or they are relatively small ( @xmath13 ) and we are not yet able to see them due to limited resolution at the distances of most nearby seyferts ( tens of ) .",
    "secondary stellar bars are apparently not that uncommon in nearby galaxies ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "perhaps the most efficient way to detect gaseous inflow to the nucleus is through the extinction caused by its embedded dust . _",
    "hst _ optical and ir images indicate that only 10 - 20% of seyferts galaxies show nuclear dust bars @xcite . instead",
    ", the _ hst _ images reveal that most ( @xmath14 ) seyfert galaxies show nuclear dust spirals @xcite .",
    "however @xcite find that nuclear dust spirals in seyfert galaxies are not statistically more numerous that those in normal galaxies .",
    "thus , it is unclear exactly how the dust spirals fuel the agn and what mechanism(s ) control the onset of nuclear activity .",
    "although these structures are common to both barred and unbarred seyfert galaxies , all of the `` grand - design '' nuclear dust spirals ( those with two long symmetric arms ) are found in barred galaxies only @xcite .",
    "these grand - design nuclear spirals appear to connect to dust lanes on the leading edge of the large - scale stellar bars .",
    "if the high accretion rate paradigm for nls1 s is correct , it suggests that the fueling of the agn is more efficient in nls1 s than in their bls1 counterparts . in @xcite ( hereafter , ckg03 ) , we provided evidence that nls1 nuclei are hosted mostly in barred seyfert galaxies as compared to bls1 nuclei : 65% of the nls1 s have bars , while only 25% of bls1 s have bars .",
    "these large - scale stellar bars typically begin at @xmath1 from the nucleus and extend to @xmath15 .",
    "they represent an efficient means of transporting large amounts of gas and dust to the inner kiloparsec region , which can presumably support large accretion rates .",
    "however we did not study the inner regions ( @xmath16 ) of the bls1 s and nls1 s , where establishing a connection between seyfert 1 type and inner morphology would be even more crucial for understanding the fueling of the active nucleus .    the motivations for this paper came from the need to understand the nuclear structures that exist within the central regions of nls1 s .",
    "there are no previous studies comparing nls1 and bls1 samples for differences in nuclear morphology .",
    "many of the earlier studies @xcite were focused mainly on seyfert 1.8 to seyfert 2 galaxies . @xcite and @xcite included about equal numbers of seyfert 1 s and 2 s and investigate the differences between seyfert 1 s and 2 s .",
    "we note that in surveys of nuclear regions of both active and normal galaxies with _ hst _ @xcite and ground - based imaging studies @xcite , it was found that nuclear dust spirals are seen in similar frequencies in _ both _ active as well as inactive galaxies .",
    "hence it is not clear if nuclear spirals are indeed efficient in fueling the central source .",
    "further , @xcite find that barred galaxies ( either active or inactive ) preferentially show a grand - design type of nuclear morphology , while unbarred ones show tightly - wound nuclear spirals . since host galaxies of nls1 s are found to be barred from ckg03 , we might expect to see grand - design as the preferred nuclear morphology for nls1 s .",
    "our sample contains the _ hst _ broadband ( primarily f606w ) wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) images of seyfert 1 galaxies obtained in the snapshot survey of @xcite .",
    "this is a uniform sample of 91 seyfert 1 galaxies with @xmath17 derived mainly from the compilation of @xcite .",
    "a typical exposure for each snapshot was 500s , and nearly all of the galaxies fell on the pc chip , which has a resolution element of @xmath18 .",
    "the number of useful nls1 s in this sample is small ( 13/91 ) ; we excluded mark 335 , as it appears as a point source in the wfpc2 image , leaving 12 nls1 s out of 91 seyfert 1 s .",
    "we did not use the five additional nls1 s at higher redshifts from our previous study ( see table  1 in ckg03 ) as we do not have enough resolution at their distances to study nuclear characteristics .",
    "we have also not used ugc 05025 which is a nls1 with @xmath19 of @xmath20 as the f814w exposure time is just 80 secs and the nuclear region is not well exposed .",
    "however we note that this galaxy is barred .",
    "not all galaxies in the sample had their centers within the pc chip ; following is a list of these : f1146 ( wf2 ) , pks 0518 - 458 ( wf4 ) , was 45 ( wf4 ) , um 614 ( wf2 ) .",
    "these are all bls1 s and hence have little effect on our results .",
    "we decided to not include ir  1319 - 164 in our analysis as most of the galaxy is outside the pc chip in the wfpc2 field of view on the sawtooth side .",
    "we compiled the redshift ( z ) , axis ratio ( b / a ) , the hubble stage ( t ) and the absolute blue magnitude , @xmath21 from ned for the whole sample .",
    "@xmath21 is computed from the corrected asymptotic blue magnitude @xmath22 ( corrected for interstellar extinction and the k - correction ) .",
    "we used @xmath23 , with @xmath24 , @xcite .",
    "there are galaxies for which we had to assign a value to the numerical hubble stage index ( t ) , this value was assigned by looking at the morphological classification given as part of the basic data for an object in ned and the table describing the coding of morphological types in the third reference catalogue of bright galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter rc3 ) .",
    "we have also used the de vaucouleurs atlas of galaxies by buta , corwin and odewahn ( in preparation ) to assign these values .",
    "the values of @xmath22 were selected only from rc3 for consistency .",
    "the axial ratio ( @xmath25 ) were chosen from the rc3 data section provided in ned .",
    "table  1 shows our sample and its properties .",
    "the first column gives the name of the galaxy , the second column gives the redshift of the galaxy from ckg03 , and the third column gives the rc3 axial ratio ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the fourth column gives the numerical hubble stage index ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the fifth column gives the corrected absolute blue magnitude ( @xmath21 ) computed as given above .",
    "the sixth column gives the seyfert 1 class , whether the galaxy is a nls1 or a bls1 .",
    "the seventh column gives the large - scale morphology as classified in this paper .",
    "the eighth column gives the nuclear morphology classification for each galaxy .",
    "three galaxies had main morphology classifications that could not be defined .",
    "these are heao 2106 - 098 ( point source ) , mark 40 ( ? ) , mark 335 ( point source ) .",
    "ir 1319 - 164 was not included in the analysis as most of the galaxy is outside the pc field of view .",
    "this resulted in a sample of 87 seyfert 1 s where both large - scale and nuclear structures could be classified .",
    "we tested the sample for selection biases that may have been introduced due to the heterogeneous nature of our sample .",
    "figure  1 shows the histogram plots of the four host galaxy parameters .",
    "the histogram with solid boundary line shows the bls1 sample ( 75/87 objects ) , while the shaded histogram with dashed boundry line shows the nls1 sample ( 12/87 objects ) . in table  2",
    "we list the representative numbers that describe the sample .",
    "the spread ( @xmath27 ) reported are standard deviations for the sample in question .",
    "the sample as a whole ( 87 seyfert 1 s ) have a median hubble stage index of 1.0 , moderately high inclinations of @xmath28 and median redshift of 0.024 .",
    "when we break up the sample into nls1 and bls1 classes based on their @xmath29 fwhm ( done in ckg03 ) , we see that the nls1 s are slightly more face - on and have a median t of 3.0 as compared to bls1 s which are more edge - on and have a median t of 1.0 .",
    "the nls1 s are also 0.73 mag .",
    "less luminous than bls1 s in the median , which is close to the standard deviation of both groups .",
    "all of the differences are smaller than the quoted spreads of the sample .",
    "however , we discuss their possible impact towards the end of  3 .",
    "we retrieved all the images from the _ hst _ archives , which were calibrated with the standard hst pipeline . since this is a snapshot survey , we only had single frames per galaxy and hence we employed a routine written in idl to detect and remove cosmic rays .",
    "this routine is written specifically for handling wfpc2 data and is tuned for the pc chip .",
    "the routine scans the input image for pixels affected by cosmic rays and iteratively discards them , replacing them with average values of pixels in a box centered on the pixel being discarded .",
    "the routine also estimates the sky background simultaneously by selecting various peripheral sections of the input image .",
    "this option can be turned off in case the galaxy covers the whole of pc , which is the case for most images .",
    "various parameters of the routine control the selection of scanning box size and how to distinguish a faint star from a cosmic ray hit .",
    "we also replaced bright foreground stars within the image with a square area on the opposite side of the image , with the line joining the two sections passing through the center of the galaxy .",
    "we made sure that none of these areas contained any dust structures .",
    "it should be noted that none of these foreground stars were close to the centers of the galaxies being studied .",
    "this process was required so that the image enhancement process used would not be affected by the presence of areas of large intensity apart from the central point source .",
    "since we are looking for dust structures near the nuclear source , the cleaner the image , the better the contrast enhancement .",
    "residual cosmic rays were examined and cleaned by eye using a combination of iraf and idl tools .",
    "we have employed the method used by @xcite to enhance the contrast of dusty structures .",
    "this process has been called `` structure mapping '' and is based on the richardson - lucy ( r - l ) deconvolution process .",
    "the structure map is the correction image that emerges from the second iteration of an r - l image reconstruction .",
    "it highlights unresolved and marginally resolved structures , as the first - order smooth structures are removed .",
    "one starts with a good estimate of the _ hst _ point spread function ( for wfpc2 detectors ) and uses it to perform an operation similar to unsharp masking via division .",
    "one divides the original image with a psf - convolved version of the original image , multiplying the resulting image with the transpose of the psf .",
    "this results in an image which contains the high frequency components enhanced in contrast .",
    "the resultant image forms the second - iteration corrector image in a r - l deconvolution process ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it is crucial that a properly matched psf be used to generate these structure maps .",
    "we used 2-d gaussian fits to the saturated cores of the seyfert 1s to determine the location of the central source on the chip , and then generated psfs by using the tinytim software @xcite .",
    "the form of the _ hst _ wfpc2 psf depends on the following parameters in the order of importance : filter used for the observations , the location on wf or pc detector , the secondary mirror focus position , and the color of object being observed .",
    "the latter two parameters were not of great importance , as the final structure map did not show significant improvement in quality when these parameters were tweaked .",
    "most of the galaxy centers were not near any of the available observed psfs for wfpc2 , hence using tinytim was the only way to get reasonable psfs .",
    "psf subtraction was attempted but yielded inconclusive results .",
    "information is essentially lost in the saturated core . to attempt subtraction ,",
    "the psfs where scaled to the intensity of the central source and embedded in image sections the same size as the original image being worked on .",
    "many images had saturated cores and we estimated best fit 2-d profiles by looking at 1-d cross - sections through the core and fitting the wings to estimate the scale factor .",
    "the fits were also judged based on the quality of output structure maps . since structure maps are quite sensitive to large variations in brightness levels in pixels , performing psf subtration and then forming a structure map from the resulting image was not practical .",
    "final processed structure maps are shown in figure  2 ( see @xcite for the original images ) .",
    "the figures are arranged in the same order as the galaxy name in table  1 . for each galaxy ,",
    "we show the structure map of a 600 x 600 pixel region of the pc chip which avoids the overscan regions .",
    "the first and third rows show these full structure map sections , while rows two and four show the nuclear regions of these structure maps zoomed to appropriate size to facilitate display of nuclear structure .",
    "the zoomed nuclear regions for each galaxy are below the full structure map image . in the figure ,",
    "each image shows the size of the region in arcseconds on the vertical axis , as well as the corresponding projected size of the image in kiloparsec ( assuming @xmath30 , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the top title .",
    "the structure map images are bounded by lower and upper thresholds to display faint structures properly .",
    "the images are also color inverted .",
    "dusty , high extinction areas appear white , while emission regions appear dark .",
    "compass markers indicate the north and east directions on the image .",
    "the color bar at bottom is provided as a guide to how the brightness and contrast of the image was stretched between the applied upper and lower thresholds .",
    "the first two authors independently classified the nuclear structures without prior knowledge of the seyfert type ( bls1 or nls1 ) or the main galaxy morphology .",
    "we looked at the original image as well as the structure map in the process .",
    "we chose the following notation for our classification : ds for nuclear dust spiral , db for nuclear dust bar , a for amorphous dust clouds , dl for large - scale dust lane passing in front of the central source and nd for no significant dust structure .",
    "we also noticed that several galaxies showed star - forming rings inside the central kiloparsec and in two cases ( mark 334 and mark 1044 ) star - forming nuclear spiral arms .",
    "we called the starburst nuclear spirals , sbs and the nuclear rings , nr .",
    "further , we classified the dust spirals ( ds ) into two secondary classes : gd for two arm grand - design spirals and fl for flocculent multi - armed spirals .",
    "the nuclear dust spirals which could not be classified into these two classes were bunched together with the notation `` ? '' for their secondary classification .",
    "we call a nuclear dust spiral grand - design ( gd ) , if it has two distinct symmetric dust spiral arms . examples in figure  2 include mark 1126 , mark 42 and mark 766",
    ". tol 2327 - 027 is a spectacular example of this class .",
    "the flocculent dust spirals ( fl ) were defined to be those that showed more than two distinct spiral arms peppered with puffy gas and dust clouds .",
    "this class essentially bunches together the classes tw and lw from @xcite .",
    "examples of this class include : eso 323-g77 , eso 354-g4 , mark 1330 , mark 590 and mark 609 .",
    "ngc 2639 is a good example of the multi - arm nature of these spirals .",
    "there were other cases with only a single dust arm visible ( mcg8 - 11 - 11 , ngc 6104 , mark 744 ) , the galaxy has a high inclination which prevented a clean classification ( f51 ) , or showed slightly chaotic grand - design like structure with a hint of a dust bar - like structure ( ic 1816 , mark 334 , um146 ) .",
    "these were not given any special secondary classification and were grouped together in a category called `` ? '' .",
    "our class a corresponds to class c ( for chaotic ) from @xcite . in the final classification , we cross - checked and reassigned appropriate classes to the few cases where we originally disagreed .",
    "the appendix at the end of the text of this paper lists all the galaxies and the reasons for their individual classifications .    also during the classification process we noticed that a few of the galaxies had been previously classified as a spiral ( class s ) in ckg03 , when on inspection of structure - mapped images and wfpc2 mosaics , they looked to be barred spirals ( class sb ) .",
    "for example , in the pc2 image of eso 215-g44 in @xcite , the large - scale bar is not obvious , but can be seen clearly in a structure map .",
    "other such cases have been recorded in the appendix .",
    "these galaxies have since been reclassified as sb in table  1 . in ckg03 , they had concluded that excluding point sources , ellipticals , irregular and unclassified ( main morphology class ) galaxies ( 12 out of 97 ) : 34% ( 29/85 ) of spiral seyfert 1 s are barred , 65% ( 11/17 ) of nls1 s are barred , and 26% ( 18/68 ) of bls1 s are barred , indicating a high fraction of barred host galaxies for nls1 s . with our revised classification , we now conclude from the ckg03 sample of 97 seyfert 1 s that , excluding point sources , ellipticals , irregular and unclassified ( main morphology class ) galaxies ( 12 out of 97 ) , we now have : 47% ( 40/85 ) of spiral seyfert 1 s are barred , 76% ( 13/17 ) of nls1 host galaxies are barred and 40% ( 27/68 ) of bls1 host galaxies are barred .",
    "thus the incidence of large - scale bars in nls1 s is still much larger than that in bls1 s .",
    "in table  1 , we give the results of our classifications .",
    "column 7 gives the large - scale morphology based on the structure maps and wfpc2 mosaic images ( see ckg03 for the original classifications ) .",
    "column 8 gives the nuclear morphology classification for each galaxy . within the parenthesis in column 8",
    "is the secondary nuclear classification .",
    "galaxies that were not given a formal secondary dust spiral classification are included in the category `` ? '' .",
    "table  3 and table  4 shows the frequencies of these classes as fractions ; number counts for galaxies are given in parenthesis along with one sigma uncertainities assuming a binomial distribution ( since all the classes are independent and each structure is either present in the galaxy or not ) .",
    "the distributions are given for the entire sample of 87 seyfert 1 s , as a function of class ( nls1 bls1 ) and as a function of the host galaxy morphology ( barred spirals unbarred spirals ) .",
    "table  4 shows the distributions for gd , fl and the undefined ( `` ? '' ) categories of dust spirals .",
    "all of the entries in this table come from the galaxies that show dust spirals ( table  3 , column",
    "3 ) as their primary nuclear morphology .    figure  3 shows the bar plots for each class of nuclear structure . for each graph ,",
    "the vertical axis is frequency of the structure and the horizontal axis has the various classes as in table  3 . on the top of each bar",
    "is the fraction corresponding to the class being presented .",
    "the plots on the right side correspond to comparison of barred vs unbarred galaxies in the sample while the plots on the left side correspond to nls1 s bls1 s .",
    "we do not see nuclear dust bars , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrate how stellar secondary bars can be uniquely identified with help of isophotal analysis and unsharp - masking .",
    "since structure mapping is similar to unsharp - masking , we could have noticed the presence of secondary stellar bars , but we did not detect any .",
    "table  3 and figure  3 show that @xmath31 of nls1 s and @xmath32 of bls1 s have nuclear dust spirals , implying that nuclear spirals are the favored morphological features , in agreement with @xcite . in table  4",
    ", we see that @xmath33 ( 8/10 ) of nls1 s with nuclear dust spirals have grand - design type nuclear spirals as compared to @xmath34 ( 16/50 ) for bls1 s with nuclear dust spirals .",
    "we also see that , @xmath35 ( 22/32 ) of barred spirals with nuclear dust spirals have grand - design structure , compared to @xmath36 ( 2/28 ) in the unbarred spirals . since the sample of seyferts with barred galaxy morphology is more than doubled by adding barred bls1 ( 27/75 ) to the nls1 ( 9/12 ) sample , and yet the percentage of grand - design nuclear dust spirals ( 22/32 , 69% of barred seyfert 1 sample with dust spirals ) remains almost the same as for nls1 s ( 8/12 , 67% ) , we conclude that large - scale stellar bars are the principal driver of the grand - design dust structure . even though we have only 12 nls1 s in our sample , 9 are barred and we see that 8 of them show grand - design nuclear dust spirals .",
    "this lends support to the idea that higher fueling rates in nls1 s are helped by the transfer of gas on kiloparsec scale via large - scale stellar bars which almost always form grand - design dust spirals within @xmath37 of the nuclei of nls1 s .    during the classification process for nuclear dust structures",
    ", we noticed that several galaxies in our sample showed nuclear star formation in the form of stellar nuclear rings or star - forming nuclear spiral arms .",
    "eso 323-g77 , ir 1249 - 131 , mark 42 , mark 493 , mark 530 , mark 744 , mark 896 , mark 1044 , ngc 1019 , ngc 6212 , ngc 7469 , tol 2327 - 027 and was 45 show nuclear star - burst rings ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "mark 334 and mark 1044 show nuclear spiral arms with star forming sites embedded in them .",
    "table  3 and bar plots in figure  3 show that @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) of nls1 s show recent star - formation in nuclear rings .",
    "one out of these ( mark 1044 ) has star formation in the nuclear spiral instead of the nuclear ring . in comparison only @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) bls1 s show recent nuclear star formation in the form of nuclear rings .",
    "again only one ( mark 334 ) shows star formation in the nuclear spiral arms .",
    "we do not think that we have missed any inner stellar rings due to the presence of luminous point sources , unless they are very small .",
    "the size of the saturated point source is typically much less than @xmath42 and at a median @xmath19 of @xmath43 ; @xmath42 ( about @xmath44 pixels ) corresponds to about @xmath45 at resolution of _",
    "we note that all galaxies that host stellar nuclear rings also show grand - design dust spirals and are barred galaxies ; see the nr category in the top right plot in figure  3 .",
    "as mentioned previously , the nls1 s and bls1 s in our sample show slight differences in their luminosities ( @xmath46 mag . ) , inclinations ( @xmath47 ) and hubble stage ( @xmath48 stages ) .",
    "it is unlikely that these differences have an impact on our ability to detect the nuclear dust morphology and the presence of nuclear rings .",
    "as we have discussed , both observational and theoretical studies show that the presence or abscence of a large - scale stellar bar is the principal driver in determining the nuclear morphology .",
    "since it is difficult to detect large - scale bars in highly inclined system , we tested the robustness of our results by excluding galaxies with inclinations greater than @xmath49 . with this constrain , we have 10 nls1 s and 66 bls1 s . from this reduced sample ,",
    "9 out of 10 nls1 s ( 90% ) have nuclear dust spirals . out of these 9 dust spiral , 7 are grand - design ( 77% ) and one flocculent ( 11% ) . in comparison , out of 66 bls1 s , 48 ( 73% )",
    "show nuclear dust spirals . 15 ( 23% ) of these",
    "are grand - designs , while 22 ( 33% ) are flocculents .",
    "further , 8/10 ( 80% ) nls1 s are barred compared to 27/66 ( 41% ) bls1 s , showing that nls1 s are more barred than bls1 s as for the whole sample . of the total 35 barred galaxies in this reduced sample of 76 galaxies , 21 ( 60% )",
    "have grand - design nuclear spirals , while 4 ( 11% ) are flocculents . of the 32 unbarred galaxies in this reduced sample , 19 ( 59% ) show flocculent nuclear spiral , while one shows grand - design ( 3% ) .",
    "further , 5/10 ( 50% ) nls1 s show nuclear rings , while only 9/66 ( 14% ) of bls1 s show nuclear rings .",
    "thus the difference in inclination does not seem to contribute to a selection bias for bars .",
    "we noted above that intrinsically nls1 and bls1 samples differ in their absolute blue magnitudes .",
    "we suppress the contribution of the nuclear point source when creating the structure maps . any residual contribution to the magnitude due to the hubble type of the galaxy or the nature of its bulge , will be very much smaller than the initial luminosity difference present in the original image between the point source and the rest of the galaxy .",
    "thus we think our ability to detect faint dusty structures near point sources has not been affected by the intrinsic magnitude differences between the nls1 and bls1 host galaxies .",
    "thus in conclusion the trends we see in our original sample of 87 galaxies seem to be robust against small variations in the host galaxy parameters .",
    "our statistical analysis shows that the grand - design nuclear dust spirals are largely present in barred galaxies , which is consistent with previous studies .",
    "we have also found that nls1 galaxies , which are thought to have relatively high accretion rates , tend to show large scale stellar bars , nuclear rings and grand - design nuclear spirals .",
    "are grand - design nuclear spirals indeed more efficient in fueling the central nucleus ?",
    "here we summarize from the literature the theoretical efforts to answer this question . the linear density wave theory @xcite forms the theoretical underpinnings of hydrodynamical simulations of gas inflow in barred galaxies .",
    "@xcite showed that the morphology of the nuclear gas / dust spiral depends on two factors : central mass concentration and sound speed in the gas ( gravitational potential and amount of turbulence present in the gas disk ) . the pitch angle ( angle between the spiral arm and a tangent to a circle intersecting with the spiral arm at radius r ) of the spiral is thus dependent on these two factors and ideally one can probe these factors based on the morphological features of the nuclear disk .",
    "we note that this has not been done so far by any study . in the presence of a large - scale stellar bar potential ,",
    "the hydrodynamical simulations from several studies @xcite show that inflow along leading - edges of the stellar bars form `` grand - design '' type spiral structure in the central kiloparsec .",
    "it seems from the discussions in these papers that the presence of the large - scale stellar bar potential overwhelms the effects of nuclear gravitational potential and turbulence throughout most of the central kiloparsec .",
    "this effect is reflected in the tendency of tightly - wound nuclear spirals to avoid barred galaxies in agreement with our observations ( see fl category in bottom right bar plot in figure  3 ) .",
    "the merging of grand - design nuclear spiral arms with the leading - edge bar shocks indicates that the nuclear spiral is not decoupled from the large - scale stellar bar , and that the nuclear spiral pattern is _ maintained _ by the bar potential .",
    "@xcite show that the velocity field of the gas in grand - design nuclear spirals has a large negative divergence .",
    "this is indicative of strong shocks along the curving dust lanes , which are needed to drive gas down to the scale of tens of parsec .",
    "the merging of grand - design spiral arms with leading - edges of large - scale bars occurs regardless of underlying nuclear potential or sound speed in gas , hinting at the importance of large - scale bars in driving the grand - design nuclear spiral .",
    "simulations of @xcite indicate that the average inflow rates at @xmath1 are @xmath50 , at @xmath51 they decrease to @xmath52 , and at a distance of @xmath53 they are @xmath54 in models with both a central smbh of @xmath55 and a large - scale stellar bar .",
    "the inflow at distances of 40 pc is @xmath56 times smaller in models without a black hole . in the absence of a secondary bar on scales of hundreds of parsec ,",
    "one probably needs a strong main bar potential to drive spiral shocks close to tens of parsec scales .",
    "since local seyfert galaxies have mass accretion rates of @xmath57 @xcite , it seems plausible that the analysis of @xcite may be in the right direction .",
    "further in the case of flocculent and tightly - sound nuclear spirals , it is not clear at present if the inflow rates are substantially reduced as compared to those in grand - design nuclear spirals , as detailed simulations have not been done .",
    "the presence of strong shocks in the ism is accompanied by star - formation activity .",
    "we noted in the previous section that we see more nuclear rings in nls1 s as compared to bls1 s , and the same is true for a barred unbarred comparison .",
    "presence of these bright stellar nuclear rings indicates that the central kiloparsec has been fueled in the last few hundred megayears .",
    "further , bright star - forming regions are often seen on the outer periphery of the main curving dust lanes in these systems .",
    "studies of the ring phenomena in galaxies , have shown that rings are resonance phenomena and are often found in galaxies with a large - scale bar , @xcite .",
    "the size of nuclear rings in our sample corresponds with typical values for nuclear rings measured by other observers @xcite , and ranges from about @xmath51 to @xmath37 ; tol 2327 - 027 would be an exception due to its large ( @xmath58 ) circumnuclear disk ( see appendix ) .",
    "@xcite mention that size distribution of nuclear rings peaks at about the same radius as the location of the ilr of the main large - scale bar .    on the whole ,",
    "we conclude that large - scale stellar bars drive the formation of and maintain grand - design nuclear dust spirals , which plausibly provide sufficient inflow rates to fuel the smbhs in nls1 s .",
    "recent simulations and the presence of star formation confined in a nuclear ring in the central kiloparsec give support to the idea that the gas loses its angular momentum via nuclear spiral shocks driven by the main bar potential .",
    "however , it is not clear what the mass inflow rates in flocculent nuclear spirals are .",
    "since flocculent spirals are not driven by orbital resonances of a non - axisymmetric gravitational potential like a bar , it is plausible to expect that spiral shocks in flocculent spirals are much weaker , leading to less efficient accretion rates .",
    "observational support for this is that very little star formation is seen in flocculent type nuclear spirals in unbarred galaxies , while grand - design spirals show enhanced star formation on the outer edges of their spiral arms and in stellar nuclear rings ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also appendix in this paper ) .",
    "however inflow rates in flocculent spiral need to be studied using numerical simulations .",
    "we have analyzed _ hst _ broad - band ( f606w ) images of a sample of 91 seyfert 1 galaxies to study their nuclear morphology .",
    "we employed structure maps to enhance fine dust structure in the nuclear regions .",
    "accompanying images in figure  2 provide a good repository to study nuclear dust structures in seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "our sample contains 12 nls1 hosts and 75 bls1 host galaxies .",
    "this allowed us to compare the nuclear morphology of nls1 host galaxies to the bls1 host galaxies . in @xcite ( ckg03 )",
    ", we had noticed that nls1 s showed more large - scale bars as compared to bls1 s .",
    "we have revised the main morphological classification from ckg03 with the aid of structure maps , and conclude that 76% of nls1 host galaxies are barred as compared to 40% for bls1 hosts .",
    "overall , almost half ( 47% ) of the spiral seyfert 1 galaxies from ckg03 are barred .    in this paper",
    ", we find that nuclear dust spirals are the most common kind of morphology in the central kiloparsec of seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "we find that 80% of the nls1 s have grand - design type nuclear spirals as compared to 32% for bls1 s .",
    "further we see that 69% of barred galaxies have grand - design morphology as compared to 7% for unbarred ones .",
    "this is in agreement with the trend noted by @xcite .",
    "this is also indicative of the fact that these nuclear spirals are being driven and maintained by large - scale stellar bars .",
    "we also find that most bls1 host galaxies have multi - arm , flocculent or chaotic nuclear dust spirals .",
    "we find that 42% of the nls1 s have nuclear star formation in the form of nuclear rings as compared to 11% of bls1 s .",
    "similar distribution is seen when one compares barred galaxies with the unbarred ones .",
    "this again indicates that the large - scale bar is the main driver of these differences .",
    "this strengthens the idea that large - scale bars are important to support high fueling rates in nls1 s .",
    "thus our results in this paper support the fueling scenario for barred unbarred galaxies via nuclear dust spirals .",
    "recent simulations of gas and dust inflow in barred galaxies give support to the idea that the galactic disk gas loses its angular momentum via nuclear spiral shocks which are being driven by the main bar potential within the central kiloparsec .",

    "<S> we find that nls1 s preferentially have grand - design dust spirals within @xmath1 of their centers . </S>",

    "<S> we find that many of the morphological differences are due to the presence or absence of a large - scale stellar bar within the spiral host galaxy </S>",
    "<S> . in general , barred seyfert 1s tend to have grand - design dust spirals at their centers , confirming the results of other researchers . the high fraction of grand - design nuclear dust spirals and stellar nuclear rings observed in nls1 s host galaxies suggests a means for efficient fueling of their nuclei to support their high eddington ratios .    0  h_0 </S>"
