    "<S> that is , the entropically driven six - fold perturbation in the present model appears to be more dangerous than the corresponding energy perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> this is surprising , particularly so , given the observed small values for @xmath16 compared to @xmath15 near the transition , which confirms the weak nature of the entropic perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , our value of @xmath94 appears to be closer to the value @xmath95 found for an orbital model with the same @xmath8 symmetry.@xcite in the supplemental material we present additional mc data for @xmath18 , which show that @xmath90 does not change with a varying strength of the effective @xmath8 anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite thus , the question of universality for the critical exponent @xmath90 in different realizations of 3d @xmath8 models appears to be an open one .    </S>",
    "<S> _ neutron scattering._we now turn to the peculiar line shape for the magnetic bragg peaks observed by ruff _ et al._in neutron diffraction experiments on @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite measuring the elastic signal at @xmath96  mk in the vicinity of the ( 2,2,0 ) bragg reflection , they found that the resolution limited peak indicative of true long - range magnetic order coexists with broad diffuse wings characteristic of short - range spin - liquid like correlations . </S>",
    "<S> the elastic scattering can be simulated within the static approximation through the structure factor @xmath97 where @xmath98 now are spin components perpendicular to the wavevector . equating this to the scattering function corresponds to setting the magnetic form factor equal to unity . in the following we </S>",
    "<S> adopt the standard convention for pyrochlore antiferromagnets , giving wavevectors in units of @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is a linear size of the cubic cell containing 16 magnetic ions .     for @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line shows @xmath102 fit for the diffuse scattering wing . ]    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : sq ] shows mc results for @xmath103 on a logarithmic scale in the vicinity of the @xmath104 reflection obtained at @xmath60 for @xmath75 on three large clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the bragg peak has a width @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> after a pronounced dip , the magnetic structure factor displays a few damped finite - size oscillations with period @xmath106 . besides that @xmath103 has a finite diffuse component , which gradually decreases with the distance from the bragg peak . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity in the scattering wing follows a power law @xmath107 with @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding fit is shown by a dashed line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sq ] .    </S>",
    "<S> this general behavior closely resembles the experimental profile of the ( 2,2,0 ) peak in @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite additional mc simulations included in supplemental material @xcite show that the form of the diffuse scattering wings is maintained as the temperature is lowered but that the intensity is reduced by a factor of 4 between @xmath60 and @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the persistence of the diffuse scattering is consistent with the phenomenon of order stabilized through fluctuations , with the temperature dependence being indicative of a thermal process . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the anomalous intensity wings have been observed experimentally at @xmath96  mk@xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret this as a manifestation of the quantum dynamics , which are present in the original effective spin-1/2 model ( [ h0 ] ) for @xmath1 , providing evidence that , at low temperature the order is indeed maintained by quantum fluctuations , as has been previously proposed . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite finally , we remark that a similar profile for the bragg peaks was observed in @xmath112,@xcite in which ferromagnetically aligned @xmath113 components of magnetic ions coexist with antiferromagnetic ordering of transverse components .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusions._the model of anisotropic @xmath0 pyrochlore antiferromagnet has been shown to reproduce essentially all experimental features of the frustrated magnetic material , @xmath1 , including a second order phase transition to the six - fold symmetric @xmath13 state , driven by an order by disorder mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> our extensive monte carlo simulations provide convincing evidence that the transition falls into the universality class of an emergent @xmath0 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the underlying discrete symmetry manifests itself at the transition as a dangerously irrelevant scaling variable . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling is found to be more dangerous than in the previously studied case of energetic perturbation , @xcite despite a very weak onset of six - fold ordering in the critical region . </S>",
    "<S> future work could investigate the role of entropic forces for this apparently non - universal dangerous irrelevance by , for example , studying a clock model with the same hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> simulated neutron scattering patterns below the transition show the coexistence of both bragg peaks and an extensive background of diffuse scattering characteristic of spin liquid behavior in good agreement with experiment . while in the experiment </S>",
    "<S> the diffuse scattering persists down to low temperature , it weakens in our classical system providing evidence of the presence of extensive quantum fluctuations in @xmath1 .    </S>",
