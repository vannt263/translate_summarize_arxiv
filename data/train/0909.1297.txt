    "the formalism of open quantum systems has been used to describe the tendency to thermal equilibrium of a small system in weak interaction with a large heat bath at a certain temperature .",

    "namely , the time derivative of the quantum relative entropy , called _ entropy rate _ , has a definite sign .",
    "the quantum relative entropy has also been used as a possible measure of the entanglement content of a quantum state : the so - called _ relative entropy of entanglement _ provides a pseudo - distance between a state and the closed convex set of separable states  @xcite .    in  @xcite the natural question",
    "was raised whether the entropy production due to thermodynamical tendency to equilibrium is somewhat related to the _ entanglement rate _ , that is to the speed of variation of the relative entropy of entanglement .",
    "a conjecture was put forward that for systems immersed in an external bath without a direct source of entanglement due to hamiltonian interactions , the absolute value of the entanglement production is always smaller than the entropy production .",
    "typically , a system @xmath0 immersed in a large environment @xmath1 is subjected to decoherence ; therefore , one expects quantum entanglement to be generically depleted by a dissipative and noisy time - evolution .",
    "the conjecture mentioned above is motivated by the fact that , if a quantum open system tends to a separable equilibrium state , then , in a suitable neighborhood of the latter , the entanglement production is zero while the entropy production is not .",
    "indeed , in  @xcite a concrete example that validates the conjecture is offered of a 2-qubit system in which only one of them evolves as a quantum open system .",
    "in such a case an initial maximally entangled state evolves towards a separable steady state with an entropy production always larger than the speed with which entanglement is dissipated",
    ".    however , in certain specific situations , an environment affecting both parties of a bipartite system may even build quantum correlations between the subsystems which compose @xmath0 ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , in  @xcite this possibility is shown to depend on the specific form of the generator of the reduced dynamics . in  @xcite an inequality was found , involving the entries of such a matrix which , if fulfilled , is sufficient to ensure that a specific initial separable pure state of two qubits gets entangled . further , in  @xcite this inequality was proven to be a necessary and sufficient condition for environment - induced entanglement in an initially separable pure state of two qubits . even more interestingly ,",
