    "in this supplementary material we show : ( i ) how to apply the procedure of sudden imprinting of momentum by a laser - pulse at the many - body level within the multiconfigurational time - dependent hartree for bosons ( mctdhb ) method ; ( ii ) how the phase of the split - pulse applied to the initially - coherent soliton governs the loss of the inter - hump coherence ; ( iii ) how the fringe visibilities depend on the phase difference between the split and recombining pulses .",
    "the multi - configurational time - dependent hartree method for bosons ( mctdhb ) is used to solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation : @xmath95 here @xmath96 and @xmath97 is the generic many - body hamiltonian defined in the main text .",
    "the mctdhb _ ansatz _ for the many - body wave - function @xmath98 is taken as a linear combination of time - dependent permanents : @xmath99 where the summation runs over all possible configurations whose occupations @xmath100 preserve the total number of bosons @xmath8 .",
    "so , the fock state @xmath67 studied in the main text is one of the terms in this sum .",
    "the expansion coefficients @xmath101 and shapes of the orbitals @xmath102 are variational time - dependent parameters of the mctdhb method , determined by the time - dependent variational principle .    to solve a time - dependent problem means to specify an initial many - body state and to find how the many - body wave - function evolves .",
    "the initial mctdhb many - body state is given by initial expansion coefficients @xmath103 and by initial shapes of the orbitals @xmath104 .",
    "the famous gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) mean - field is a limiting case of the mctdhb ansatz , obtained when only a single orbital , i.e. , @xmath105 , enters the expansion . in this case only one configuration @xmath106 with the @xmath107 orbital is needed , @xmath108 .",
    "here it is worthwhile to recall that the many - body mctdhb(m ) wave - function has the following general property ( freedom ) : any unitary operation applied to the orbitals @xmath102 , e.g. , a linear combination representing a rotation between symmetric and localized orbitals , can be compensated by a `` contra - rotation '' of the expansion coefficients @xmath101 , keeping all the observables and , thereby , the physics unchanged .    at the mctdhb@xmath109gp level",
    "the procedure of imprinting of the momentum @xmath18 in one - dimensional setups is well - defined  one multiplies the gp orbital @xmath110 by the respective function : @xmath111 the application to a more general case is straightforward , e.g. , @xmath112 .",
    "the resulting orbital has to be properly re - normalized .    in the general mctdhb(m )",
    "case the situation is more delicate . in the one dimensional case , to imprint a momentum @xmath18 to each and every atom of the system at @xmath113 one can use the same receipt as in the gp case  the initial shapes of the orthonormal orbitals @xmath114 are multiplied by the @xmath115 prefactor ( function ) : @xmath116 this transformation keeps the resulting orbitals orthogonal for any set of the initial orthonormal orbitals .    for more sophisticated pulses a similar approach is applicable , but one should take care about the orthogonality and normalization of the transformed orbitals .",
    "for example , the @xmath117 pulse can be applied to the mctdhb(2 ) wave - function only when the respective orbitals have symmetric ( gerade ) and anti - symmetric ( ungerade ) structure . for a localized ( rotated ) set of the orbitals such",
    "a transformation is inapplicable , because the transformed orbitals become non - orthogonal : @xmath118 @xmath119 @xmath120 the last integral can be zero if the orbitals have different symmetries or a zero overlap . of course , the orthogonality of the orbitals after the applied pulse can be restored manually by applying the gram - schmidt renormalization technique .",
    "an alternative and more consistent way is to apply a unitary operation rotating the initial orbitals and respective expansion coefficients before the applied pulse such that the symmetry of the orbitals is restored . for both @xmath7-pulses investigated in the main text",
    "the symmetry of the orbitals is naturally present and preserved . for the general case , discussed below , where the second applied pulse has a different phase , we have used the above discussed gram - schmidt re - normalization .",
    "we have applied the @xmath121 pulse with @xmath48 to the same initially - coherent idealized @xmath4$]-shaped soliton @xmath122 as in the main text . for this initial many - body state",
    "it is legitimate ( technically ) to apply pulses of any shape , because the second involved orbital has zero occupation . after the applied pulse irrespective to its phase @xmath26 ,",
    "the initially unoccupied second natural orbital occupation @xmath34 becomes macroscopically populated with time , indicating on the fragmentation in the system , see fig .",
    "s[fig01sup ] .",
    "the results depicted in this figure demonstrate that the coherence between the split sub - clouds is lost via the development of macroscopic two - fold fragmentation .",
    "interestingly , the way how the coherence is lost does depend on the imprinted initial phase @xmath26 . for the phase @xmath51",
    "the coherence is `` preserved '' during the longest time , while already a very small @xmath123 phase results in a fast degradation of the coherence . from a practical point of view",
    "it means that an attempt of experimental stabilization of the coherence by adjusting the phase of the split laser pulse would not lead to significant improvements .",
    "here it is worthwhile to mention that similar simulations done with a more `` realistic '' initial state obtained as a many - body ground state of the same system with attractive interaction in an harmonic @xmath124 trap , gives very similar results , implying that a small ( less a percent ) depletion of the initial cloud does not change the physics  after the spit the coherence is lost .     of the split - pulse @xmath125 applied to the fully condensed ( coherent ) idealized @xmath4$]-shaped soliton .",
    "evolutions of the first @xmath31 and second @xmath34 natural occupation numbers obtained as eigenvalues of the reduced one - particle density matrix at each propagation time are plotted .",
    "after the applied split - pulse",
    "the second natural orbital quickly becomes populated . comparing the interference patterns plotted in middle panels of fig .  1 and the values of @xmath34 depicted by line - point - style curve for the same system ,",
    "one concludes that the development of the two - fold fragmentation is accompanying by degradation of the fringe visibility .",
    "in contrast , the gross - pitaevskii theory predicts complete coherence of the system for all the propagation times and for all the applied phases .",
    "all quantities shown are dimensionless.,width=415 ]",
    "here we simulate the full interferometric sequence within the two - pulses protocol used in the main text for the case when the applied pulses have different phases .",
    "specifically , we have applied it for the same system under investigation and used the following protocol ( with the above caution on the re - enforcement of the ortho - normalization of the involved orbitals ) : ( i ) the ideal soliton is split by the @xmath7-phase pulse @xmath1 and propagated in the trap ( see fig .",
    "1 ) within the mctdhb equations till the first re - collision event at @xmath46 where the system becomes @xmath72 fragmented ; ( ii ) at the re - collision time a second recombining laser - pulse of the same momentum @xmath48 is applied ; ( iii ) we propagate the mctdhb equations next @xmath126 units of time till the full separation of the sub - clouds , and measure the visibility @xmath38 which equals to the relative occupation of the 0k - channel .",
    "next , we repeat steps ( ii ) and ( iii ) for different phases @xmath127 of the second applied pulse .",

    "we have also applied the same protocol and the steps ( ii ) and ( iii ) to the @xmath128 fragmented system taken from fig .  1 at the second re - collision event @xmath75 .",

    "these areas correspond to possible mismatch ( uncertainty ) in determination of the moments of the first @xmath129 $ ] and second @xmath130 $ ] re - collision events . from fig .",
    "s[fig03 ] it is clearly seen that the closer the system to an ideal 50%-50% fragmented state is , the smaller is the amplitude of the oscillation of the visibility .    the same two - pulse protocol simulated within the gp theory provides us with a perfect oscillation of the visibility @xmath131/[2\\!-\\!cos(\\chi_2)]$ ] as a function of the phase @xmath127 of the second applied pulse .",

    "<S> the mutual orthogonality of the constituting gerade and ungerade parts allows us to apply the same logic to a general fock state @xmath67 , @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> in such a two - fold fragmented system the occupation of the second natural orbital @xmath34 and the population of the @xmath66-channel ( the visibility @xmath38 ) are linearly connected : [ nu_n2 ] n^_2/n=1- . here </S>",
    "<S> the subscript @xmath69 is used to distinguish the interferometric measurement of the fragmentation from the exact value available after the diagonalization of the one - body density @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the above relation , eq .  ( [ nu_n2 ] ) , has been obtained for the idealized single - configurational @xmath67 fock state built from the symmetric and anti - symmetric orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> so , it is also valid in a many - body realm where the propagating system is described by a linear combination of these fock states @xmath70 with different weights @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> to demonstrate it we study the last interferometric step within the split scenario from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig01 ] , now at the many - body level . the recombining laser - pulse with @xmath7-phase and @xmath48 applied to the many - body wave - function taken from the middle panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig01 ] , at the first re - collision event @xmath46 , splits it into three sub - clouds . at this moment </S>",
    "<S> the system is momentarily fragmented with @xmath72 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> after the applied pulse we propagate the system further till @xmath49 where all three matter - waves are separated in space , the computed density marked as @xmath33 is depicted in the upper panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig02 ] . by integrating it in the gray area </S>",
    "<S> , corresponding to the @xmath66-channel , one gets @xmath73 . from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ nu_n2 ] ) we obtain the interferometric fragmentation @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> we apply the same protocol to the many - body states taken from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig01 ] at the second @xmath75 and third @xmath76 re - collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the computed densities after the separation are marked in the upper panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig02 ] as @xmath77 and @xmath78 according to the actual occupation of the second natural orbital at the respective re - collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the integrations of the @xmath66-areas gives the interferometric fragmentation @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) for the second re - collision and @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) for the third one . </S>",
    "<S> in all these examples the @xmath38-based interferometric fragmentation @xmath83 is very close to the corresponding natural occupation number obtained by the diagonalization @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> small deviations are mainly due to the mismatch in the determination of the re - collision times , see @xcite for details . </S>",
    "<S> concluding , the above - discussed interferometric protocol and eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ nu_n2 ] ) allows one for the direct measurements of the fragmentation .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we have investigated interferometry in low - dimensional ultra - cold systems with attractive inter - particle interaction at the many - body level . </S>",
    "<S> two matter - waves obtained from the initially - coherent cloud by an applied laser - pulse inevitably loose the inter - hump coherence and become fragmented due to inter - particle attractions . </S>",
    "<S> the degree of fragmentation can be directly measured by re - colliding the constituting sub - clouds with a simultaneous imparting of a proper momentum at the re - collision time . within this protocol fragmentation </S>",
    "<S> becomes directly proportional to the occupation of the zero - momentum channel . furthermore and without loss of generality , the proposed protocol to discriminate coherent and fragmented many - body systems with two - hump densities can be expanded to measure fragmentation in generic many - body systems with attractive , repulsive short- and long - range inter - particle interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> we hope this work will stimulate the direct experimental measurements of fragmentation in attractive becs with two - hump densities and validate the predicted interaction - induced loss of inter - hump coherence . </S>",
    "<S> this knowledge can help to improve matter - wave interferometry further .      </S>",
