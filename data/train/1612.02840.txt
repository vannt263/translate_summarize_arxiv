    "thin and narrow superconducting nanowires to which a bias current is applied can be used to detect single photons @xcite .",
    "absorption of a single photon of visible light is sufficient to switch part of the wire from the superconducting to the normal state and results in a measurable voltage .",
    "an appropriate design of the biasing electronics removes the current from the device once it is in the normal state , allowing the wire to self - reset to the superconducting state on a nanosecond timescale  @xcite .",
    "the specific benefits of these detectors are their broad spectral range ( from visible to infrared wavelengths ) @xcite , ultra - low dark - count rates @xcite , excellent timing resolution @xcite , and high detection efficiency @xcite .",
    "this makes these detectors very suitable for use in quantum optics @xcite , quantum communication @xcite , and life sciences @xcite .    to optimize optical absorption in these superconducting single photon detectors ( sspds ) , a meandering nanowire geometry embedded inside an optical cavity",
    "is preferred @xcite .",
    "device efficiencies close to 100% can only be achieved when a bias current ( @xmath0 ) is applied that creates a current density sufficiently close to the critical current density ( @xmath1 ) of the superconducting material .",
    "this threshold for efficient detection depends on photon energy  @xcite and higher bias currents are needed to detect photons with lower energy ( i.e. longer wavelength ) .",
    "an open challenge in this field is to extend the boundary for efficient detection of infrared radiation to the red . in general ,",
    "thin and narrow wires are more difficult to fabricate but are expected to be better for detecting low energy photons because the absorption of a single photon in these devices affects a larger fraction of the total available cooper pairs compared to a thicker and wider wire .",
    "however , thicker and wider wire are easier to fabricate with fewer defects  @xcite and , more importantly , imply a lower kinetic inductance of the wire which yields detectors with a desirable faster response time  @xcite .",
    "a compromise between detection efficiency and speed needs to be found , which seems to be set by the material of the nanowire .",
    "we have reported a linear relation between a threshold current and photon energies for 150 nm wide nbn nanodetectors  @xcite , i.e. significantly wider than the nanowires in nbn based sspds @xcite . in this simple geometry",
    "the device critical current is closer to the critical current density of the material  @xcite . for ( meandering ) wires",
    "the device critical current is limited by other factors such as current crowding in bends  @xcite , fabrication defects along the wire  @xcite , thickness variations of the wire , or inhomogeneities intrinsic to the superconducting material  @xcite .",
    "our recent experimental results  @xcite as well as the improved understanding of the detection mechanism in sspds  @xcite show that the edges of an sspd are generally more efficient than the center of the wire .",
    "hence , the internal detection efficiency ( @xmath2 ) depends on position and bias current and is described by a quantity that we call the local detection efficiency @xmath3 .",
    "uniform detection efficiency is only reached for a bias current that exceeds the threshold current for all positions in the wire .",
    "the variations in the local detection efficiency become more prominent for wider wires ( @xmath480 nm for 4 nm thick nbn film ) , lower bias currents and lower photon energy .",
    "the effects of a non - uniform @xmath5 will become noticeable in detectors that can not be biased close to the material critical current density and in the roll - off regime of the efficiency as a function of bias - current .",
    "this regime becomes more important for infrared photon detection and in various sspd based devices where multiple nanowires are operated in parallel to obtain photon number resolution  @xcite or a multi - pixel detector .",
    "these devices can not be operated very close to the critical current because the supercurrent redistributes over the superconducting nanowires when one of the nanowires / pixels becomes normal due to the absorption of a photon .    in this article , we present novel designs of sspds where the absorption position and overall absorption efficiency are optimized simultaneously .",
    "a known limitation of ( meandering ) wires is that the detection efficiency depends on the polarization of the incident light @xcite ; at normal incidence absorption is more efficient when the electrical field vector of the light is aligned parallel to the wires , an effect governed by the boundary conditions on the edges of the nanowires .",
    "recently , a design of a cavity - based structure was reported that tries to eliminate the polarization dependence and achieves up to 96% absorption efficiency for both polarizations @xcite , assuming that the internal detection efficiency is uniform across the nanowire .",
    "detailed measurements of the polarization dependent response of both meandering wires @xcite and nanodetectors @xcite separate the optical absorption from the electronic detection process and reveal that the internal detection efficiency depends on polarization .",
    "this conundrum can be resolved if one assumes a position dependent local detection efficiency @xmath3 in combination with a polarization and position dependent absorption @xmath6 of the detector .",
    "a microscopic detection model that uses quasiparticle diffusion and photon - assisted vortex entry @xcite , can explain the position dependence of the photon detection efficiency in term of an edge barrier for vortex entry . within this model , absorption of a photon breaks cooper pairs to create a cloud of quasi particles that diffuses through the wire . the dominant effect for the photon detection process is a reduction of the edge barrier for vortices .",
    "photon detection occurs when a vortex crosses this energy barrier and travels across the wire and dissipates energy . when a photon is absorbed in the middle of the wire the barrier for vortex entry is affected to a much lesser extent than when a photon is absorbed at the edge of the wire , explaining the physical origin of more efficient detection at the edge of the wire .",
    "we performed a study of a nbn nanodetector as a function of both wavelength and polarization of the incident light and employed detector tomography to separate the optical absorption efficiency ( @xmath7 ) from the internal detection efficiency ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "a numerical calculation of the wavelength and polarization dependent absorption profile , together with the local detection efficiency @xmath3 determines the response of the detector .",
    "we find  @xcite that photon absorption events occurring at the edge of a 150  nm wide wire are much more likely to produce a detection event than those in the middle .",
    "based on the experimental data this `` edge effect '' extends roughly 30  nm into the wire and forms the basis of an empirical model for the position dependent detection efficiency of a nbn detector .",
    "this model can be summarized as follows .",
    "the internal detection efficiency @xmath8 depends on the bias current @xmath0 and can be calculated from the absorption profile @xmath6 and the local detection efficiency @xmath9 @xmath10 where @xmath7 is the average optical absorption over the wire @xmath11 the internal response of an sspd depends on photon energy and device bias current , and for a constant photon energy , the response increases exponentially as a function of bias current and saturates above a threshold current .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we posit a relation between the local detection efficiency @xmath12 , bias current @xmath0 and threshold current @xmath13 , where the position dependence is expressed through the position dependence of the threshold current @xmath14 , & \\text{if } i_b\\leq i_{th}(x ) \\\\      1 ,               & \\text{otherwise } \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 = 0.65 @xmath16a is taken as a wavelength independent current scale that can be extracted from experiments by fitting the internal detection efficiency @xmath2 as a function of @xmath17 in ref .",
    "the function can be further specified through an assumption that the local threshold current @xmath13 depends linearly on photon energy .",
    "this assumption is based on the observation that the position averaged response shows linear energy dependence  @xcite and is further supported by numerical calculation of the microscopic detection model  @xcite .",
    "@xmath18 where @xmath19 is the device critical current and @xmath20 is the photon energy .",
    "the absorption profile depends on the wavelength of the incident radiation and has to be obtained through numerical computation .",
    "the @xmath21  4 nm thick nbn film is much thinner than the skin depth of the relevant wavelength range .",
    "hence , the absorption distribution is uniform over the thickness of the film and is a function of position @xmath22 across the nanowire only .",
    "we used a commercial finite - difference - time - domain method ( fullwave package , rsoft @xcite ) and obtain the absorption profile for plane wave illumination at normal incidence as @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the width of the wire , @xmath25 is the power density of illumination incident on the wire , @xmath26 is the absorbed power density as a function of position @xmath22 across the wire width , @xmath27 is the angular frequency of the incident light , @xmath28 is the vacuum permittivity , @xmath29 = 4.35 nm is the thickness of the nbn film obtained from ellipsometry measurements , and @xmath30 is the ( polarization dependent ) electric field intensity in the wire .    it should be noted that the model put forward here contains a number of approximations and assumptions to capture the strong decrease in detection effciency in the center of the wire with a minimum number of parameters .",
    "this is expressed through the exponential dependence of the lde given by eq .",
    "[ eq : lde ] in combination with a wavelength independent @xmath15 .",
    "these assumptions work well to describe nbn nanowires , but are not universally true .",
    "recent results on mosi nanowires  @xcite indicate an error function instead of exponential current dependence and a wavelength dependent @xmath15 .",
    "we have verified that incorporating these new insights will lead to small changes in the lde and the computed values reported , but will not qualitatively change the observations and conclusions of our current work .",
    "we use the simple model with fewer free parameters and define the response through the function @xmath31 , which is the only unknown .",
    "this function can be obtained through a numerical inversion procedure where we use the value of @xmath31 sampled at 9 positions across the wire as fit parameters .",
    "details of this procedure can be found in ref .",
    "the resulting function @xmath31 reflects the fact that the edges of the wire are more efficient at photon detection at reduced current compared to the center . the experimental data are consistent with highly efficient edges that extend @xmath2130 - 40 nm into the wire .",
    "important additional support for this empirical model can be found by comparing the predictions of the model to the measured polarization - dependent absorption and detection efficiency of a set of meandering nbn sspds by anant et al .",
    "these data show that the internal detection efficiency is less than 100% in devices and depends on polarization .",
    "good quantitative agreement between these data and the empirical model can be achieved if one assumes that meandering wire devices are biased at a current density that is 90% of the material limited critical current density measured on the nanodetector @xcite    in this article we are interested in the implications of the local detection efficiency for future detector design and we need a stable and reliable implementation of the function @xmath31 .",
    "the original empirical model shows small , non - monotonic , variations in detection efficiency closer to the edges of the wire that are currently not understood .",
    "the amplitude of these variations is comparable to the accuracy of the numerical inversion procedure but may affect the numerical optimization of the detector design . to avoid these numerical issues we use the original data from ref .",
    "@xcite and use a tikhonov regularization procedure with an additional constraint that the function @xmath31 is monotonic .",
    "a criterion that increases the value of @xmath32 by 20% compared to the minimum value is sufficient to achieve this .",

    "the curves are determined from experimental data .",
    "( b ) detection response distribution @xmath34 across the 150 nm wide nbn wire at the same bias currents as shown in ( a ) .",
    "the solid and dashed curves represent parallel ( @xmath35 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath36 ) polarization , respectively . the grey area between the solid and dashed curves at bias currents of 0.8@xmath33 and @xmath33 shows the difference of the local response between the two polarizations.,width=283 ]    figure  [ fig : ldeith](a ) shows the results of the @xmath12 at bias currents @xmath0 = 0.8@xmath37 , 0.9@xmath37 and @xmath37 for photons with a wavelength of 1550 nm ( 0.8 ev energy ) using the monotonic version of @xmath31 . as can be seen , the edges of the wire have much higher local detection efficiency compared to the center for lower bias currents .",
    "as the bias current increases , the detection efficiency at the edge starts to saturate and for currents close to the critical current of the nanodetector the efficiency @xmath12 equals one over the entire width of the wire .",
    "figure  [ fig : ldeith](b ) shows the calculated local response @xmath38 for both polarizations and values of the bias currents ( @xmath0 = 0.8 @xmath19 , 0.9 @xmath19 and @xmath19 ) .",
    "for the highest bias current this local response distribution @xmath34 is not limited by the @xmath12 and thus reflects the profile of the absorption distribution @xmath6 .",

    "an observed count rate is proportional to the local response @xmath34 integrated over position .",
    "we emphasize that this calculation depends on the geometry of the detector , the energy of the photons and the bias current through the nanowire .",
    "we compute the internal detection efficiency of differently designed sspds and visualize this by plotting the total detector response as a function of the optical absorption .",
    "detectors that reach 100% internal detection efficiency can always be designed for high energy photons and bias currents close to the material critical current density .",
    "instead we are interested in the transition regime where the detectors become inefficient due to a combination of low bias current and/or low photon energy . in this regime the performance of the detectors can be improved by design of the sspd and its surroundings .",
    "such designs extend the sensitivity of sspds towards infrared wavelengths without compromising other device parameters such as response time and jitter . in practice , the regime of less than 100% detection efficiency is reached for photon detection at 1550 nm with nbn meandering wire detectors that can not be biased to the material critical current density due to fabrication imperfections and bends in the wire  @xcite .",
