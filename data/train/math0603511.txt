    "the schoenflies conjecture is weaker than the still unsolved @xmath3-dimensional pl poincar conjecture , and so might be more accessible .",
    "little explicit progress has been made on the schoenflies conjecture for several decades , a time which has nonetheless seen rapid progress in our understanding of both @xmath1- and @xmath3-dimensional manifolds .",
    "here we outline how the schoenflies conjecture is connected to another important problem on the border between classical @xmath1- and @xmath3-dimensional topology , namely the generalized property r conjecture .",
    "we show how how at least some of the last two decades of progress in combinatorial @xmath1-dimensional topology , particularly sutured manifold theory , can be used to extend the proof of the schoenflies conjecture from what are called genus @xmath0 embeddings of @xmath7 in @xmath2 to genus @xmath1 embeddings . in some sense",
    "this is a pathetic advance , but it has some philosophical interest : genus @xmath0 surfaces have long been known to have special properties ( eg the hyperelliptic involution ) that are not shared by higher genus surfaces .",
    "that this approach works for genus @xmath1 suggests that the special properties of genus @xmath0 surfaces are not needed and so are not a barrier to success for arbitrary , higher genus embeddings .",
    "we work in the pl category throughout .",
    "all manifolds discussed are orientable .",
    "recall the famous property r theorem , proven in a somewhat stronger form by david gabai @xcite :    [ thm : propr ] if @xmath8-framed surgery on a knot @xmath9 yields @xmath10 then @xmath11 is the unknot .",
    "it is well - known ( indeed it is perhaps the original motivation for the property r conjecture ) that property r has an immediate consequence for the handlebody structure of @xmath3-manifolds :    [ cor : propr ] suppose @xmath12 is a homology @xmath3-sphere and has a handle structure containing exactly one @xmath0-handle and no @xmath1-handles .",
    "then @xmath13 is the @xmath3-sphere .",
    "since @xmath13 has a handle structure with no @xmath1-handles , dually it has a handle structure with no @xmath14-handles . in order for @xmath13 to be connected , this dual handle structure must then have exactly one @xmath8-handle , so the original handle structure has a single @xmath3-handle .",

    "@xmath17 can be thought of as the regular neighborhood of a graph or , collapsing a maximal tree in that graph , as the regular neighborhood of a bouquet of circles .",
    "the @xmath3-dimensional regular neighborhood of a circle in an orientable @xmath3-manifold is @xmath18 , so @xmath17 is the boundary connected sum @xmath19 , some @xmath20 .",
    "( explicitly , the number of summands @xmath21 is one more than the difference between the number of @xmath14-handles and @xmath8-handles , ie @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the euler characteristic of the graph . )",
    "it follows that @xmath24 and , in particular , @xmath25 .",
    "now consider the closed complement @xmath26 of @xmath17 in @xmath13 . via the dual handle structure , @xmath26 is obtained by attaching a single @xmath0-handle to @xmath27 , so it deformation retracts to a @xmath0-sphere and , in particular , @xmath28 .",
    "since @xmath13 is a homology @xmath3-sphere and @xmath29 , it follows from the mayer - vietoris sequence @xmath30 that @xmath31 , so @xmath32 and @xmath33 .    on the other hand , @xmath26 , whose handle structure ( dual to that from @xmath13 ) consists of a @xmath8-handle and a @xmath0-handle ,",
    "is visibly the trace of surgery on a knot in @xmath7 , namely the attaching map of the @xmath0-handle .",
    "the framing of the surgery is trivial , since the generator of @xmath34 is represented by @xmath35 and this class visibly has trivial self - intersection .",
    "since the result of @xmath8-framed surgery on the knot is @xmath33 , the knot is trivial by property r ( theorem [ thm : propr ] ) so @xmath26 is simply @xmath36 .",
    "hence @xmath13 is the boundary union @xmath37 .",
    "of course the same is true of @xmath2 , since the closed complement of a neighborhood of the standard @xmath0-sphere in @xmath2 is @xmath18 .",
    "so we see that @xmath13 can be obtained from @xmath2 by removing the standard @xmath18 and pasting it back in , perhaps differently .",

    "the generalized property r conjecture ( cf kirby problem 1.82 ) says this :    [ conj : genr ] suppose @xmath38 is a framed link of @xmath39 components in @xmath7 , and surgery on @xmath38 via the specified framing yields @xmath40 .",
    "then there is a sequence of handle slides on @xmath38 ( cf @xcite ) that converts @xmath38 into a @xmath8-framed unlink .    in the case",
    "@xmath32 no slides are possible , so conjecture [ conj : genr ] does indeed directly generalize theorem [ thm : propr ] . on the other hand , for @xmath41 it is certainly necessary to include the possibility of handle slides . for",
    "if one starts with the @xmath8-framed unlink of @xmath21-components and does a series of possibly complicated handle - slides , the result will be a possibly complicated framed link @xmath38 of @xmath21-components .",
    "the result of doing the specified framed surgery on @xmath38 will necessarily be the same ( cf @xcite ) as for the original unlink , namely @xmath42 , but @xmath38 itself is no longer the unlink .",
    "the example @xmath38 is still consistent with conjecture [ conj : genr ] since simply reversing the sequence of handle slides will convert @xmath38 back to the framed unlink .",
    "so in some sense conjecture [ conj : genr ] is the broadest plausible generalization of theorem [ thm : propr ] .",

    "is a handlebody , as required .",
    "we now apply the results of the previous sections to complete the proof of the genus @xmath1 schoenflies conjecture .",
    "[ thm : main ] suppose @xmath43 is a genus @xmath1 rectified critical level embedding of @xmath7 in @xmath2 . then after a series of reimbeddings of @xmath43 via other genus @xmath1 rectified critical level embeddings , each of which changes at most one of the complementary components of @xmath43 , one of those complementary components is @xmath27    we assume that any possible genus @xmath1 rectified critical level reimbedding of @xmath43 that preserves at least one complementary component and simultaneously decreases the number of handles has been done . if any further such a sequence of reimbeddings via lemmas [ lemma : tubereimbed ] or [ lemma : torreimbed ] ( reimbeddings that do nt raise the number of handles ) results in @xmath261 ( resp @xmath260 ) becoming a handlebody , then @xmath4 ( resp @xmath5 ) is @xmath27 , via proposition [ prop : midheeg ] .",
    "so we assume no such further sequence exists and use the results of the previous section to see if there are other options . with no loss of generality ,",
    "assume the cocore @xmath408 of the highest @xmath14-handle lies in @xmath261 and let @xmath482 denote the core of the lowest @xmath0-handle .",
    "following lemma [ lemma : sameside ] we can assume that the cocore @xmath412 of the previous @xmath14-handle lies on the @xmath5-side and the cocore @xmath483 of the next @xmath14-handle lies on the side opposite the one on which @xmath482 lies .",
    "suppose @xmath408 and @xmath482 are both separating .",
    "if both @xmath408 and @xmath482 lie in @xmath261 , then it follows from corollary [ cor : separate ] that at least two of the non - separating cores of the @xmath0-handles and at least two of the non - separating cocores of the @xmath14-handles all lie on the @xmath5-side of the surfaces to which they are attached .",
    "so both @xmath266 and @xmath215 are @xmath3-dimensional handlebodies of genus at least @xmath0 . but the mayer - vietoris sequence for @xmath484 glued along @xmath260 then contradicts @xmath485 , cf the proof of lemma [ lemma : rhosum ] .    on the other hand , if @xmath486 and @xmath487 then , following corollary [ cor : oppside1 ] and lemma [ lemma : oppside3 ] , @xmath412 is non - separating and lies in @xmath260 . then interchange @xmath408 and @xmath412 ,",
