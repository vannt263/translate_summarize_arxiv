    "models for neutrino masses typically operate at high energy scales , like the gut scale . however from the experiments we obtain information about the low energy values of the parameters . to compare them , it is essential to evolve the parameters of the models from high to low energies .",
    "this is accomplished by the renormalization group equations ( rge s ) for the operators of the theory . when the standard model ( sm ) or the mssm is viewed as an effective field theory ,",
    "majorana masses for the neutrinos can be introduced via an effective operator of mass dimension 5 , which couples 2 lepton and 2 higgs doublets .",
    "the most promising scenarios for giving masses to neutrinos use the see - saw mechanism , which provides a convincing explanation for their smallness .",
    "it can be realized by a renormalizable theory with the particle content of the sm or the mssm extended by 3 heavy neutrinos that are singlets under the sm gauge groups .",
    "the singlets typically have large explicit ( majorana ) masses with a spectrum , which is non - degenerate in general . due to",
    "this non - degeneracy one has to use several effective theories with the singlets partly integrated out , when studying the evolution of the effective mass matrix of the light neutrinos .",
    "we review the tools necessary to perform the renormalization group analysis of the neutrino mass parameters in various models .",
    "numerical solutions to the rge s show that there can be large effects for the running of the lepton mixing angles , especially for the solar angle @xmath0 .",
    "the currently favored lma solution of the solar neutrino problem can e.g.  be obtained in a natural way from bimaximal mixing @xcite as well as from @xmath1 , @xmath2 @xcite at the gut scale by renormalization group effects .",
    "let @xmath3 , @xmath4 , be the su(2)@xmath5-doublets of sm leptons and @xmath6 the higgs doublet . the dimension 5 operator , which gives majorana masses to the sm neutrinos after electroweak ( ew ) symmetry breaking ( figure [ fig : kappavertex ] ) , is given by @xmath7 @xmath8 is symmetric under interchange of the generation indices @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the totally antisymmetric tensor in 2 dimensions , and @xmath12 is the charge conjugate of the lepton doublet .",
    "@xmath13 are su(2 ) indices .",
    "the corresponding expression in the mssm is the @xmath14-term of the part of the superpotential @xmath15 where the chiral superfield @xmath16 contains the lepton su(2)@xmath5-doublets and @xmath17 contains the higgs doublet with weak hypercharge @xmath18 .",

    "similar corrections have also been made in the rge s for the neutrino mass operators in two higgs doublet models ( 2hdm s ) @xcite .",
    "the calculation of @xmath21-functions is simplified considerably in supersymmetric ( susy ) theories , since due to the non - renormalization theorem @xcite only wavefunction renormalization has to be considered for operators of the superpotential . however , in a component field description , no use can be made of the theorem with respect to gauge loop corrections since it is no longer manifest when a supergauge , as for example wess - zumino - gauge , has been fixed .",
    "the supergraph technique @xcite , on the other hand , allows to use the non - renormalization theorem since susy is kept manifest .",
    "it can thus be used to calculate @xmath21-functions in supersymmetric theories for operators of the superpotential from the wavefunction renormalization constants .",
    "these operators may be non - renormalizable since for the latter the non - renormalization theorem holds as well @xcite and they do not affect the wavefunction renormalization constants in leading order in an effective field theory expansion . for the wavefunction renormalization constants , general formulae exist in the literature .",
    "thus one can formulate a construction kit for calculating 2-loop beta functions in @xmath48 supersymmetric theories , which can be applied to renormalizable and non - renormalizable operators of the superpotential @xcite .",
    "we applied it to calculate the 2-loop beta functions for the lowest - dimensional effective neutrino mass operator in the mssm and for the yukawa couplings ( including @xmath49 ) in the mssm extended by singlet superfields and the majorana mass matrix @xmath50 for the latter .",
    "the calculation of the 1-loop part of the rge for the neutrino mass operator in the mssm yields @xmath51 confirming the existing mssm result @xcite . using the construction kit , from the supergraph diagrams shown in figure [ fig : twoloopselfenergydiagrams ] , for the 2-loop part we obtain @xcite @xmath52   \\,\\kappa    \\nonumber \\\\   & & -    \\left [   2\\ , ( y_e^\\dagger   y_e   y_e^\\dagger    y_e ) ^t   -\\left (    \\frac{6}{5}\\,g_1 ^ 2    -   \\mbox{tr}\\,(y_e   y_e^\\dagger )     - 3\\ , \\mbox{tr}\\,(y_d   y_d^\\dagger )   \\right )   \\,(y_e^\\dagger   y_e)^t \\right ]   \\ , \\kappa    \\nonumber \\\\   & & -\\ ,   \\kappa \\ , \\left [      2\\ , y_e^\\dagger   y_e   y_e^\\dagger   y_e    -\\left (    \\frac{6}{5}\\,g_1 ^ 2    -   \\mbox{tr}\\,(y_e   y_e^\\dagger )     - 3\\ ,",

    "to study the rg running of the lepton mixing angles and neutrino masses , all parameters of the theory have to be evolved from the gut scale to the ew scale .",
