    "to get insight into the dynamics of the nuclear systems , reliable solutions of such a schrdinger equation are necessary . but extensions to this picture are possible .",
    "a more advanced and possibly necessary dynamical picture would include relativity for instance in the instant form of a hamiltonian formalism@xcite .",

    "we choose the tucson - melbourne ( tm ) 2@xmath4-exchange  @xcite and the urbana ix  @xcite models . in the first case",
    "the off - shell @xmath5 amplitude is used in a low momentum expansion , in the second case that amplitude is based on an intermediate @xmath6-excitation and a phenomenological short range part .",
    "two strengths parameters in the urbana ix 3n force are adjusted to the @xmath0h binding energy and nuclear matter density . in the tm 3n force",
    "we adjust the cut - off parameter @xmath7 for a strong form - factor parametrization separately for each nn force partner to the @xmath0h binding energy@xcite .",
    "the 3n system is solved rigorously in the faddeev scheme for bound and scattering states ; the 4n bound state is equally precisely evaluated using yakubovsky equations@xcite .",
    "a survey of typical and current results for binding energies and scattering observables is presented in section  ii .",
    "wave function properties in form of bound state two - body correlation functions are shown in section  iii .",
    "one approach of connecting them to observables is the coulomb sum rule .",
    "we briefly review that topic in section  iv and point to necessary improvements in experiment and theory in order to achieve clear and convincing results in the future .",
    "another approach in investigating correlations are electron induced two - nucleon emissions , which we study in a specific kinematics for the target nucleus @xmath0he .",
    "it is shown in section  v that fsi appear to be unavoidable ( at least below the pion threshold ) but can possibly be reduced to an easily accessible and restricted one .",
    "this might enable a search for initial state correlations in a rather controlled manner .",
    "photon induced two - nucleon emission on @xmath0he as well as the @xmath8 break - up appear to be very promising to see 3n force effects .",
    "this is illustrated in section  vi .",
    "finally we end with a brief outlook .",
    "a first necessary test of the dynamical picture are three - and four - nucleon binding energies . for five modern , high precision",
    "nn forces our theoretical results are shown in table  [ tab : trialphabindnn ] .",
    "we have taken into account charge independence and charge symmetry breaking as well as the mass difference of the proton and the neutron .",
    "further electromagnetic interactions are included and also the isospin @xmath9 admixtures .",
    "we see the by now well known under binding against the experimental values . table  [ tab : trialphabind3nf ] collects the individually adjusted @xmath7-parameters of the tm 3n force and of a modified one ( tm ) , which violates chiral invariance less than tm , and the resulting 3n and 4n binding energies .",
    "we also show the av18 plus urbana ix results .",
    "we end up with the interesting result that the theoretical @xmath10-particle binding energies for the different nn and 3n force combinations are rather close to the experimental value .",
    "there is a slight over binding , which leaves little room for the action of 4n forces .",
    "this can be quantified in the following way .",
    "the average attraction due to nn forces is 24.92 mev or 88 % from 28.30 mev .",
    "the average additional attraction due to 3n forces is 3.9 mev or 14 % and finally the average over binding is 0.5 mev , which is 2 % of 28.30 mev .",
    "if as a conjecture this would be attributed to a repulsive 4nf then this shows a nice hierarchy in the importance of two- to many - body forces . of course this is a temporary statement and can be modified in the future if more will be known about strengths and properties of 3n forces . in any case",
    "such a hierarchy is in agreement with the expectations of chiral perturbation theory@xcite .",
    "an overview of 3n and 4n binding energies is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : tjonline ] , which documents the strong correlation among them , known as tjon line @xcite .    .@xmath0h ,",

    "[ cols= \" < , > , > , > \" , ]     the argonne - illinois - los alamos collaboration has explored with the help of the greens - function monte carlo method the low energy spectra of light nuclei up to a=8  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : spec2 ] the pure av18 predictions , which are rather far away from the data and the impressive shift of theory towards the data by adding the urbana ix 3n force .",
    "but we still observe deviations , which can be resolved by including additional terms in the 3nf @xcite .",
    "further important tests of the nuclear hamiltonian without and with 3n forces are scattering processes .",
    "for three nucleons solutions for the continuum are by far most developed .",
    "the faddeev scheme  @xcite and the hyperspherical harmonic method  @xcite provide very accurate solutions .",
    "we illustrate the state of art with several cross sections and refer the reader to  @xcite and more recent papers  @xcite for a larger overview and for the very many spin observables , which probe our present day understanding of the dynamics in a very sensitive manner .",
    "[ fig : ndtot ] shows the @xmath11 total cross section , which below about 100 mev is nearly perfectly described even without 3n forces . only at the higher energies small discrepancies",
    "appear , which are however significantly reduced including 3n forces . at very low energies",
    "the inclusion of the @xmath2 coulomb force is under control . for a survey on the beautiful agreement of the angular distribution in elastic @xmath8 scattering with precise data",
    "we refer to  @xcite .",
    "thereby 3n force effects are tiny .",
    "this remains true also at somewhat higher energies as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9n ] , where the theory does not include the coulomb forces nor 3n forces . at 65 and 135",
    "mev theory based on nn forces only clearly underestimates the data in the minima whereas the inclusion of 3n forces leads to a very good agreement .",
    "this is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : e65p.elastic.ds ] and [ fig : e135.elastic.ds ] .",
    "thereby the results , as shown by two bands , are very stable under exchange of nn and 3n force combinations ( which of course describe the @xmath0h binding energy ) . finally we show in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig35n ] and [ fig : fig39n ] some break - up cross sections along the kinematical locus as a function of a suitably defined arclength @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "in general the agreement is good and at those low energies 3n force effects studied up to now are insignificant .",
    "a prerequisite to a theoretical analysis of @xmath3 data is the understanding of the d(p , nn ) reaction in the full phase space .",
    "therefore 4@xmath4-measurements of the latter process , not only at certain selected regions in phase space , are quite important to test the theory , before conclusions can be drawn from an analysis of the @xmath3 reaction .",
    "however , overall one can already say now that the dynamical picture with high precision nn forces and adjusted 3n forces works reasonably well ( with room for improvements ) and provides a good basis to analyze electromagnetically induced processes .",
    "based on fully converged solutions of the faddeev - yakubovsky equations we present two - nucleon correlation functions for ground state wave functions @xmath13 of the simplest type , namely averaged over two - body partial wave states :    @xmath14    here @xmath15 is the operator of a pair distance and @xmath16 the projector on a @xmath2 or @xmath17 pair .",
    "they are plotted ( with arbitrary overall normalization ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : crnppp ]  for @xmath18 , @xmath0he and @xmath1he and choosing two nn potentials av18 and cd bonn . at short distances below about 1  fm the predictions of the two potential are quite different .",
    "the curves are very much similar for the three nuclei , what suggests that this will essentially remain true also for heavier systems .",
    "they all peak at about 1 fm .",
    "[ fig : cr3nf ] compares directly predictions for the three nuclei , all normalized to each other in the peak value .",
    "we see a nearly perfect overlap except in the tails , where the difference in separation energies show up .",
    "finally the addition of 3n forces has no visible influence up to the radii somewhat larger than 1  fm , where binding effects have to appear .",
    "since wave functions are no observables , in consequence the wave function property @xmath19 is not an observable either .",
    "wave functions enter into observable response functions as they occur for instance in electromagnetically induced processes , but they are accompanied by final state continuum wave functions , which are also correlated and , very importantly , they come together with current operators , which should be consistent to the nuclear forces .",
    "consistent ingredients of the nuclear matrix elements should lead to the same observables ( response functions ) even if different nn force parameterization have been chosen . at present",
    "mostly av18 nn forces and consistent currents are being used .",
    "thus work remains to be done to understand possible model dependences .",
    "it has been known for a long time  @xcite that the coulomb sum rule is an approach to isolate the fourier transform of the correlation function @xmath19 .",
    "let s define the coulomb sum as @xmath20    then using the standard expression for the longitudinal response function @xmath21 in inclusive electron scattering together with the closure relation one easily finds @xcite    @xmath22    this very nice intermediate result shows that the final state interactions have been totally removed and only ground state expectation values remain . separating the density operator @xmath23 into single particle and two- and more - particle parts one easily arrives at    @xmath24    where @xmath25 are the @xmath26 electric form factors ( neglecting the time component of the four vector dependence in @xmath27 )",
    ", @xmath28 is the elastic charge form factor of the target nucleus , @xmath29 arises from the two- and more - particle densities and    @xmath30    is the quantity related to @xmath19 suitably augmented by the nucleon electromagnetic form factors @xcite .",
    "there are certain obstacles to be overcome .",
    "the integral in eq .",
    "[ eq:2 ] requires an extrapolation to catch all of the integrand above the quasi elastic peak . up to now",
    "the available data leave too much room for ambiguities in the extrapolation  @xcite and precise data at some more higher @xmath31-values would be welcome . also the first three terms on the right hand side of eq .",
    "[ eq:4 ] cancel strongly  @xcite leading to enhanced error bars for @xmath32 and @xmath33 . therefore high accuracy measurements of @xmath21 are needed .",
    "above all this refers to the nuclei @xmath0he and @xmath1he , for which at present the most precise evaluation of the ground state wave functions are possible . on the theoretical side",
    "as has been shown in  @xcite the relativistic corrections in the density operator and two - body pieces therein play an important role and can not be considered as a small perturbation .",
    "this is an interesting challenge for theory and experiment and deserves a renewed effort despite the intensive work in the past .",
    "another approach towards correlations is via electron induced two - nucleon emission on nuclei , here on @xmath0he .",
    "the most ideal situation would be that one nucleon absorbs the photon and receives its full momentum and all three nucleons leave the nucleus without any final state interaction ( fsi ) .",
    "then the measurement of the momenta of the two spectator nucleons would display directly their momentum distribution in @xmath0he .",
    "for this special kinematics the total spectator pair momentum has to be zero and those two nucleons leave back to back and show directly the relative momentum dependence within a pair of nucleons in the target nucleus @xmath0he .",
    "let us number the nucleons such that the knocked out nucleon is number 1 .",
    "then one would probe directly the expression related to the @xmath0he wave function    @xmath34    where @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath37 are the individual momenta .",
    "this quantity is plotted in fig .",

    "unfortunately reality is far from that ideal situation .",
    "fsi interferes very strongly .",
    "the eightfold differential cross section has the well known form    @xmath41    where the v s and @xmath23 are kinematical quantities , and the response functions @xmath42 are @xmath43 here enter the nuclear matrix elements @xmath44 , which are the spherical components of @xmath45 with @xmath46 note that both 3n states in eq .",
    "[ eq:9 ] are fully antisymmetrized .",

    "it is easy to show that in pwia one finds @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "thus @xmath21 and @xmath59 provide access to the same quantity @xmath60 up to known factors .",

    "is related to the spectator pair ( the above mentioned pair 23 ) .",
    "consequently it is assumed that the knocked - out nucleon is a proton .",
    "of course for pwia there is no @xmath64-dependence and we see directly the expression given in eq .",
    "fsi has a tremendous effect for all three @xmath64-values , however the simple approximation `` @xmath65 '' improves going to the higher @xmath64-values . even for higher @xmath66",
    "values fsi has a tremendous effect on @xmath21 ( a reduction factor 10 - 100 ) .",
    "at least for the higher @xmath67 values the @xmath68 approximation might be reasonable , but still one can see effects of the neglected fsi of spectator nucleons and hit proton . in case of @xmath59 we show in fig .",

    "in addition some curves include @xmath4 and @xmath23 exchange contributions consistent to av18 .",
    "their effect is totally negligible .",
    "also in this case the approximation `` @xmath56 '' is a quite good representation of the full fsi .",
    "since that fsi correction of first order in @xmath54 is very well under control given the fact that the on - shell @xmath54 is fitted to the nn data , an analysis of future data appears to be a rather reliable approach towards the quantity given in eq .",
    "there is nice stability under exchange of the nn forces av18 against cd bonn , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ppn.n0.2 ] for the example @xmath64= 400 mev / c .",
    "the situation is quite different if the hit nucleon is a neutron .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : npp.n0 ] the quantity @xmath70 .",
    "in contrast to the case before , the approximate fsi treatment `` @xmath65 '' is now totally different from the complete fsi result and thus would be totally misleading .",
    "this is of course due to the smallness of @xmath71 . for @xmath59 ,",
    "however , the `` @xmath65 '' approximation and `` full '' are not far from each other and moreover the @xmath72-dependence is relatively weak .",
    "nevertheless for both @xmath42 s the predictions are nearly independent from the specific choice of the nn force as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : npp.n0.2 ] and therefore the model dependence is weak .    all the curves in figs .",
    "[ fig : ppn.n0 ] and [ fig : npp.n0 ] refer to av18 and the angle between @xmath63 and @xmath73 has arbitrarily been fixed at @xmath74 . at the other angles the relation between the `` full '' result and the `` @xmath65 '' approximation changes , but remains within the same order of magnitude .",
    "based on these results one has to state that there is no way to access directly in that low energy regime @xmath75 .",
    "nevertheless precise measurements would be extremely informative to test the whole dynamical picture , forces and currents .",
    "choosing other kinematical conditions even in pwia the @xmath0he bound state @xmath76 is probed in such a manner that both @xmath63 and @xmath77 vary . under the prerequisite that the @xmath8 break - up process has been tested carefully against theory the @xmath3 reaction for general kinematics is a perfect tool to probe the remaining unknown ingredient , the current operator @xcite .",
    "3n forces are required for a correct description of binding energies .",
    "will they also play a role in electromagnetically induced processes ?",
    "we already started a first investigation for @xmath8 capture processes in  @xcite and would like to show new results for photodisintegration of @xmath0he , specifically at higher energies than the one considered in  @xcite . to that aim the faddeev - like integral equation in  @xcite has to be modified . the nuclear matrix element for @xmath0he @xmath78 @xmath79 can be written as @xmath80 where @xmath81 obeys the faddeev - like integral equation@xmath82 we use the siegert theorem as described in  @xcite .",
    "this includes some of the exchange currents .",
    "the operator @xmath83 is that part of the 3n force , which is symmetric under the exchange of particle 2 and 3 .",
    "we scanned the whole phase space comparing the full break - up cross section evaluated with and without 3n force .",
    "as an example we display in fig .",
    "[ fig : ee ] the @xmath84 regions where 3n force effects are larger than 40  % .",
    "the relative azimuthal angle is @xmath85 .    as an illustration",

    "measurements should validate or invalidate these sort of predictions .",
    "also in the @xmath8 break - up process 3nf effects are clearly visible as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : romek.new ] for various photon energies .",
    "one main theoretical challenge is to establish an electromagnetic current operator , which is consistent to nuclear forces . only then",
    "response functions for electromagnetically induced processes can be put on a firm ground .",
    "precise experimental data on two - nucleon emissions induced by real and virtual photons on @xmath0he will be a very important test ground to probe nuclear forces , correlated wave functions and currents . at present",
    "the 3n system is the only case where fsi is fully under control ( below the pion threshold ) and appears therefore especially promising to probe our present day understanding of nuclear dynamics .",
