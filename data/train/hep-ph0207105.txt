    "the idea of quark cluster is not new . in valon model ,",
    "the hadron is envisaged as a bound state of valence quark cluster called valon @xcite .",
    "for example , the bound state of proton consists of two `` up '' and one `` down '' valon .",
    "these valons thus bear the quantum numbers of respective valence quarks .",
    "hwa @xcite found evidence in the deep inelastic neutrino scattering data that suggested their existence and applied it to a variety of phenomena .",
    "hwa @xcite had also successfully formulated a treatment of the low-@xmath2reactions based on the structural analysis of the valons .",
    "arash @xcite has recently applied the valon model to study the contributions of the constituents of the proton to its spin in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "results of the model calculation agree well with the european muon collaboration ( emc ) results @xcite .",
    "arash adopt the valon point of view and calculate various contributions to the spin of the proton .",
    "the valon description of the nucleon was developed by hwa @xcite some years ago and was successfully used @xcite to describe the contribution of constituents of the proton to its spin in order to understand the so - called _ spin crisis . _ in this paper , we investigate the calculation of polarized parton density of the nucleon using an improved model and apply the model to the study of the spin of nucleon . in sec .",
    "2 , polarized valon distributions are derived . in this section",
    "we calculate polarized valon distributions as a function of @xmath3 from unpolarized valon distributions .",
    "the moment of polarized parton distributions and using inverse mellin transformation are discussed in sec.3 . in sec . 4",
    ", we examine the polarized structure function , @xmath4 , for proton , neutron and deuteron and compare with the experimental data .",
    "also our prediction for the first moment of these structure functions presents in this section too .",
    "the polarized valon is defined to be a dressed polarized valence quark in qcd with the cloud of polarized gluons and sea quarks which can be resolved by high @xmath1 probes . in a scattering process",
    "the virtual emission and absorption of gluons in a valon become bremsstrahlung and pair creation .",
    "the polarized structure function of a valon is determined by gluon bremsstrahlung and pair creation in qcd . at sufficiently low value of @xmath1 the internal polarized structure of a valon can not be resolved and hence it behaves as a polarized valence quark .    to facilitate the phenomenological analysis hwa @xcite assumed a simple form for the exclusive valon distribution in unpolarized proton which is @xmath5 @xmath6 is the momentum fraction of the @xmath7th valon , and @xmath8 is @xmath9^{-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the beta function .",

    "the new values of @xmath13 , @xmath14 are found to be @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "an alternative analysis of polarized structure function has been performed by gehrmann and stirling@xcite .",
    "this was done in the same spirit as the unpolarized analysis @xcite , namely the polarized valon distribution chose to be of the general form    @xmath17    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is define :    @xmath20    where the subscript @xmath21 refer to @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is defined in eqs .",
    "in order to write down the polarized valon distribution in a proton we assume that at some @xmath24 a valon behaves as a polarized valence quark . the polarized quark distribution in a proton at a starting scale of @xmath25 is parameterized by grv group @xcite .",
    "we take that parameterization and extract all of the parameters as defined in eq.(5 ) .",
    "the corresponding parameters are given in table i. in figure ( 1 ) we present unpolarized and polarized valon distributions as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "we now go to the @xmath26-moment space and define the moment of polarized valon distribution @xmath27 as :    @xmath28    the subscription @xmath29 stands for kind of @xmath22 polarized valon . for the moments of polarized singlet and non singlet distributions we shall use , the leading order solutions of the renormalization group equation in qcd .",

    "now it is very easy to used these results for calculating @xmath82 . in the quark model , to leading order ( lo ) in qcd , @xmath82 can be written as a linear combination of @xmath83 and @xmath84 @xcite ,    @xmath85\\ ] ]    where @xmath86 are the electric charges of the ( light ) quark - flavors @xmath87 .",
