    "soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) have been known as strongly magnetized neutron stars , _ magnetars_. the hallmark of these objects is to repeat x - ray or gamma - ray emissions irregularly .",
    "so far , four or five known active objects which show frequent x - ray emission of tremendously energetic and shorter initial bursts ( typically @xmath0 ergs and @xmath1 s ) have been identified with sgrs ( thompson _ et al .",
    "some of them occasionally exhibit more energetic events .",
    "the giant flare 1900 + 14 , now associated with sgr 0525 - 66 , was observed in 1979 ( mazets , golenetskii , and guryan 1979 ) for the first time and became active again in 1992 ( kouveliotou _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ) and also in 1998 ( kouveliotou _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ; hurley _",
    "et al_. 1999 ) .",
    "recently , the intense @xmath2-ray flare from sgr 1806 - 20 occured on december 27 , 2004 was reported ( palmer _ et al_. 2005 ; hurley _",
    "et al_. 2005 ; mereghetti _ et al_. 2005 ) .",
    "( 2005 ) have investigated the pulse profile and flare spectrum of sgr 1806 - 20",
    ". their study may potentially give the information about the global field structure in the magnetosphere and may further promote theoretical magnetar models .",
    "their extream peak luminosity extends up to @xmath3 estimated at a distance of 10 kpc ( mazets _ et al_. 1999 ; feroci _ et al_. 2001 ) .",
    "typical x - ray luminosities of sgrs have been measured to be @xmath4-@xmath5 erg s@xmath6 ( hurley _ et al . _ 2000",
    "; thompson _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) , except with giant bursts sgrs 1900 + 14 and 1806 - 20 .",
    "shorter durations of initial flares of sgrs are comparable to the alfven crossing time of the core .",
    "the energy distribution shows good agreement with gutenberg - lichter law , which may indicate statistical similarity to earthquakes or solar flares ( cheng _ et al_. 1996 ; gogus _ et al_. 1999 , 2000 ) .",
    "the sgrs have spin periods in a small range of @xmath7-@xmath8 s with rapid spin down rate @xmath9 ss@xmath6 , which therefore give characteristic ages @xmath10 @xmath11 yr ( mazets _ et al_. 1979 ; kouveliotou _ et al_. 1998 ; hurley _ et al_. 1999a ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "the physical nature of axps is still uncertain due to poor observations , but there seem to be some similarities and differences between sgrs and axps .",
    "axps are energetic sources of pulsed x - ray emission , whose periods lie in a narrow range @xmath12-@xmath13 s , characteristic ages @xmath14 @xmath15",
    "yr and x - ray luminosities @xmath16-@xmath5 erg s@xmath6(mereghetti 2000 ; thompson 2001 ) . axp sources likely have somewhat larger active ages and some of them have softer x - ray spectra compared with sgrs .",
    "one of the primary difference between them will be that axps so far have shown only quiescent x - ray emission with no bright active bursts such as giant flares .",
    "active ages of sgrs and axps are consistent with the observed evidence that these compact objects often give their location close to the edge of shell - type supernova remnants .",
    "neither sgrs nor axps show the presence of conspicuous counterparts at other wavelengths ( mereghetti & stella 1995 ; mereghetti _ et al_. 2002 )",
    ". origin of these enourmous energetics is likely to come from their strong magnetic fields @xmath17-@xmath18 g estimated by their spin periods and spin down rates . only the magnetar model has been able to account for the enigmatic properties of a rare class of sgrs or axps .",
    "shear and alfvenic waves play an essential role on the energy transfer to the exterior in the burst - like phenomena observed in sgrs or giant flares .",
    "the alfven wave propagation in such a strongly magnetized star should be clarified theoretically . in our previous work , the propagation and transmission of torsional alfven waves",
    "have been studied , focused only on the fundamental mode of azimuthal wave number @xmath19 as a first step . in that work ,",
    "the exterior of the star is examined qualitatively only , assuming two extreme cases : ( i ) corotating together with the star and ( ii ) static state independent of the stellar rotation .",
    "the former will come true when the plasma gas is trapped by closed magnetic field lines , and the latter will be realized without any other force . in any case , it might be inadequate at least in the following two points to place such strong constraints on the wave mode and on ambient circumstances of the star in the previous paper .",
    "first , under the more realistic situations various modes with azimuthal wave number @xmath20 are probably triggered by star quake .",
    "second , it is natural to assume that a scale height of the plasma gas is neither @xmath21 nor @xmath22 , but has a finite value of @xmath23 .",
    "et al_. ( 1998 ) pointed out that a relativistic _ fireball _ like those in classical grbs may exist in sgrs .",
    "recently , thompson and duncan ( 2001 ) have also suggested that after the initial hard spike emission , some lumps of hot plasma gas involving electron - positron pairs and high energy photons , that is , _ fireball , _ would be created on closed magnetic field lines . in fact , the fast decline and complete evaporation on x - ray light curve observed in the august 27 burst provides a clear evidence of the trapped _",
    "fireball_. motivated by this , we thus extend our study to include some plasma gas spreading over the stellar surface .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to study the physical behavior of the torsional alfven waves with azimuthal wave number @xmath24 in the presence of corotating plasma confined within a certain finite distance @xmath23 and then to investigate the effects of these quantities @xmath24 and @xmath23 on the wave propagation and transmission . in section 2 ,",
    "our model is self - consistently constructed and the relevant basic equations are formulated .",
    "these equations are almost the same as those derived in kojima and okita ( 2004 ) , but are summarized here for the paper to be self - contained . in section 3 , we shall derive the dispersion relation in a wkb way to show that the rotating plasma atmosphere plays a crucial role as a resonant cavity of the wave when a certain condition holds . in section 4 ,",
    "transmission rates of the alfven waves are numerically calculated . in section 5 , their electromagnetic field structure",
    "is also discussed with the numerical results . in section 6",
    ", we give a brief summary of our findings and their implications for the torsional alfven waves on rotating magnetars .",
    "both the magnetic field and the rotation of star lead to a complicated geometrical configuration . in this paper",
    "we assume some simplified conditions to understand the physical processes of the wave propagation .",
    "we here consider three - layered cylindrical model with radius @xmath25 .",
    "it is composed of the neutron star crust between @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( region ( 1 ) ) , corotating plasma above the stellar surface between @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( region ( 2 ) ) and static pure vacuum at @xmath29 ( region ( 3 ) ) as shown in fig.1 .",
    "the plasma gas filled in the atmosphere corotates with the crust at the same angular velocity @xmath30 .",
    "local magnetic fields permeate uniformly in each layer and point along the @xmath31 direction , @xmath32 , which represents open magnetic fields extending to infinity .",
    "alfven waves excited at the bottom of the crust @xmath33 cm owing to some mechanisms , travel upward along the local magnetic field lines .",
    "they are partially reflected and transmitted at the boundaries @xmath27 and @xmath34 , where the physical property of alfven waves significantly changes because of the effect of the background rotation , as shown below .",
    "this model , by setting @xmath35 , reduces to the case in which the plasma gas extends infinitely to the exterior of the star , while setting @xmath36 reduces to the simple case in which the exterior is filled with pure vacuum only .",
    "up to the present time , we have no observational information of the plasma size @xmath23 . in this work , @xmath23 is regarded as a free parameter in order to investigate its effect on the wave propagation and transmission .    ,",
    "region ( 2 ) corresponds to the _ fireball _ as a resonant cavity filled with plasma corotating with @xmath30 , and region ( 3 ) denotes a static pure vacuum . ]",
    "we shall now give some comments on the validity of this model by comparing the physical sizes @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath23 with the stellar radius @xmath39 . in this model we have explicitly assumed that the local magnetic field has a @xmath31-component only .",
    "our model can be applied to the polar cap region , whose cylindrical radius @xmath37 is given by @xmath40 cm @xmath41 @xmath42 cm .",
    "curvature of the stellar surface and the magnetic field lines may be neglected within the polar cap region . in a similar way",
    ", it may be valid to assume that the local magnetic field lines are uniform if the thickness of each layer is smaller than the star radius , @xmath43 .",
    "we can also extend our model to the extreme case @xmath44 . even in this case",
    ", the validity of this model nevertheless holds good near the z - axis . in the remainder of this paper we ristrict our explicit calculations only to the axially symmetric small region within the polar cap radius , unless otherwise stated .      in this section",
    ", we consider the propagation of torsional shear - alfven waves with various azimuthal modes on rotating magnetars .",
    "such waves are probably excited by the turbulent motion of the starquake in the deep crust , but above the neutron drip @xmath45 @xmath46 .",
    "many proposals for starquake model have been put forward ( e.g. , pacini and ruderman 1974 ) , but all of them are generally argued only for weakly magnetized neutron stars with @xmath47 g. therefore , their treatments are inadequate for magnetars , as they are .",
    "however , analogous mechanism may also occur in magnetars . in this paper",
    ", we do not discuss the triggering mechanism of the starquake itself , but focus only on the process by which electromagnetic shear waves , once generated , are propagated and transmitted from the deep crust , through a magnetized plasma , toward the vacuum exterior .",
    "we assume that the horizontal lagrange displacement @xmath48 is suddenly shaken in the deep interior at depth @xmath33 cm , nevertheless the matter remains immobile in the vertical direction due to strong gravity of the neutron star , @xmath49 cm s@xmath50 . therefore the following transverse wave condition may be easily satisfied.@xmath51as one of the simplest solutions , wave ansatz under this condition can be written formally as@xmath52here notation ` @xmath53 ' denotes the difference of helicity states .",
