    "insurance has been a long studied problem in economics and is in the core of recent empirical research .",
    "seminal papers by rothschild and stiglitz ( 1976 ) and stiglitz ( 1977 ) have provided benchmark models of insurance under private information on insurees risk . in empirical studies , testing adverse selection in risk has generated a large number of papers with mixed results .",
    "see chiaporri and salani ( 2000 ) for the most well known test and cohen and siegelman ( 2010 ) for a survey of empirical findings .",
    "the recent empirical literature shows that adverse selection not only involves heterogeneity in risk but also in risk aversion , which is also called advantageous selection .",
    "see e.g. finkelstein and mcgarry ( 2006 ) in long - term care insurance , cohen and einav ( 2007 ) in automobile insurance , fang , keane and silverman ( 2008 ) in health insurance , and einav , finkelstein and schrimpf ( 2010 ) in annuity market .",
    "see also cutler , finkelstein and mcgarry ( 2008 ) and einav and finkelstein ( 2011 ) for surveys .",
    "as noted in these papers , heterogeneity in risk aversion may contradict the prediction of the benchmark adverse selection models , i.e. , a low risk individual may buy a higher coverage because of high risk aversion and conversely .",
    "thus , a model of insurance needs also to incorporate incomplete information in risk aversion leading to multidimensional screening .",
    "this is known to be a difficult theoretical problem because of the violation of the spence - mirrlees ( single - crossing ) condition .",
    "see rochet and stole ( 2003 ) for a survey on multidimensional screening .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a model of insurance that includes private information in both risk and risk aversion as well as random damages and the possibility of several claims while endogenizing the contract terms .",
    "following landsberger and meilijson ( 1999 ) , we consider the certainty equivalence of no insurance as a one - dimensional representation of insurees types as this representation preserves the order of insurees after buying insurance . for convenience ,",
    "we assume a constant absolute risk aversion and a nonparametric mixture of a poisson distribution for the number of potential claims as they lead to a tractable form for the certainty equivalence . in the spirit of the theoretical literature , we consider automobile insurance with coverages of the form premium and deductible .",
    "our model contains the key ingredients of insurance and can be extended to other insurance markets such as health by adding ( say ) a copayment .",
    "thus , the model structure is defined by the joint distribution of risk and risk aversion and the distribution of damages . within this model ,",
    "we study the identification of the primitives .",
    "identification is a key step for the econometric and empirical analysis of structural models .    starting with koopmans ( 1949 ) and hurwicz ( 1950 ) , the problem of identification has a long history . as discussed by heckman ( 2001 ) , the labor literature provides several examples of the role played by identification in empirical studies . over the past fifteen years , it has received much attention with the development of structural models in empirical industrial organization .",
    "see athey and haile ( 2007 ) for a survey on the identification of auction models .",
    "the problem of ( nonparametric ) identification is important for several reasons .",
    "first , it allows to assess the conditions required ( if any ) to recover uniquely the model structure from the observables while minimizing parametric assumptions .",
    "second , it highlights which variations in the data allows one to identify each model primitive .",
    "third , some important questions related to the structural analysis of models can be addressed once identification is established .",
    "one can think of which distribution of the data can be rationalized by the model , or what restrictions the model imposes on the observables that can be used to test the model validity .",
    "several lessons can be drawn from the recent literature on the identification of models with incomplete information .",
    "first , the optimal behavior of economic agents plays an important role .",
    "for instance , in contract models , the optimality of the offered payment is useful in addition to the optimal agents behavior .",
    "see perrigne and vuong ( 2011 ) for a procurement model with adverse selection and moral hazard and luo , perrigne and vuong ( 2015 ) for nonlinear pricing .",
    "thus , in most cases we need to consider both sides of the market , i.e. the principal and the agent(s ) , and assume that the observations are the equilibrium outcomes .",
    "second , one achieves identification with standard identifying strategies such as instrumental variables and exclusion restrictions , that have been widely used in the early literature on identification .",
    "see guerre , perrigne and vuong ( 2009 ) for the identification of risk aversion in auctions and berry and haile ( 2014 ) for a recent contribution to the identification of multinomial choice demand models .",
    "third , the one - to - one equilibrium mapping between the unobserved agent s private information and the observed outcome is a key element on which identification relies . see e.g. guerre , perrigne and vuong ( 2000 ) and athey and haile ( 2007 ) in the context of auctions .",
    "our paper differs from this literature in several dimensions .",
    "first , we consider a model with multidimensional screening in which bunching / pooling can not be avoided . in this case",
    ", identification can not rely exclusively on the one - to - one mapping between the agent s unobserved types and his observed outcome / action .",
    "second , our model also considers the possibility of a finite number of options / contracts offered to each agent , while agents types are distributed over a continuum .",
    "in addition to the bunching arising from multidimensional screening , additional bunching arises because of a finite number of contracts .",
    "this represents an additional challenge in the study of identification .    to study identification of the model primitives and assess how data availability affects identification , we proceed as follows",
    "we consider several data scenarios depending on the number of offered coverages and reported claims , namely whether the number of coverages is a continuum or finite and whether the claims contain all the information , or only those above the deductible .",
    "this strategy allows us to assess how data constraint or limit the identification of primitives , and which identifying assumptions are needed .",
    "moreover , studying the identification under a continuum of coverages is important as a negative identification result would imply nonidentification of the model primitives under a finite number of coverages .",
    "a first data scenario exploits the one - to - one mapping between the level of certainty equivalence and the deductible to identify the distribution of certainty equivalence .",
    "the number of claims then plays a crucial role in identifying the joint distribution of risk and risk aversion .",
    "a second data scenario maintains a continuum of contracts but considers a damage distribution truncated at the deductible .",
    "because a continuum of contracts is offered , the subpopulation choosing full insurance , i.e. , a zero deductible , identifies the damage distribution and the argument of the first case applies .",
    "when considering a finite number of contracts in the third and the fourth scenarios , identification becomes more challenging as we can not exploit a one - to - one mapping between ( say ) the deductible and the insuree s private information .",
    "though the context is different , the number of claims continues to play a key role in identifying the marginal distribution of risk . regarding the identification of the joint distribution of risk and risk aversion , we exploit an exclusion restriction and a full support assumption requiring sufficient variations in some exogenous characteristics . under these assumptions ,",
    "the model structure is identified when the damage distribution is fully observed . on the other hand ,",
    "when the damage distribution is truncated at the deductible , we obtain identification of the structure up to the knowledge of the probability that the damage is below the deductible . the latter probability is not identified .",
    "we then discuss some identifying assumptions for the probability of damage below the deductible .",
    "a notable feature of our results under a finite number of contracts is that they do not rely on the optimality of the offered coverages .",
    "consequently , our results apply to any form of competition in the insurance industry . to complete these results , we derive all the model restrictions on the observables in the fourth data scenario .",
    "these restrictions can be used to test the validity of the model and its assumptions .",
    "for instance , a model restriction allows a test of optimality of the offered coverages .",
    "this contrasts with the previous literature as discussed above , and our results represent a novel perspective to the identification of models under incomplete information .",
    "in addition , all our results are constructive and provide explicit equations for estimation and testing .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 presents the model .",
    "sections 3 and 4 study identification under a continuum of contracts and under a finite number of contracts , respectively .",
    "section 5 discusses some identifying strategies for the damage probability below the deductible and derives all the restrictions imposed by the model on observables .",
    "section 6 concludes with future lines of research .",
    "an appendix collects the proofs .",
    "this section develops a model in which insurees have private information about their risk and risk aversion .",
    "the presence of multiple private information leads to multidimensional screening with pooling at equilibrium .",
    "see rochet and stole ( 2003 ) for a survey .",
    "following landsberger and meilijson ( 1999 ) , we use the concept of certainty equivalence to rank and screen insurees . to fix ideas and in the spirit of the early literature , we consider automobile insurance as an example throughout the paper though our framework also applies to ( say ) homeowner and rental insurance .",
    "see the end of this section for a discussion of health insurance .    the benchmark model by stiglitz    this section briefly reviews the stiglitz ( 1977 ) model and motivates our model that incorporates heterogenous preferences and a random damage / expense .",
    "it also introduces basic notations .",
    "insurees are characterized by a probability of accident ( risk ) @xmath0 $ ] distributed as @xmath1 with a density @xmath2 .",
    "an accident involves a fixed damage @xmath3 affecting the insuree s wealth @xmath4 . because agents are risk averse , they buy insurance by paying a premium @xmath5 .",
    "the insurance company requires a deductible @xmath6 for each accident . upon buying insurance , the agent s wealth is @xmath7 in the event of no accident with probability @xmath8 and @xmath9 in the event of an accident with probability @xmath10 .",
    "his expected utility is then @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a von neumann - morgenstern utility function , which is continuous , strictly increasing and concave .",
    "the risk @xmath10 is private information while @xmath12 is known by the insurer .    in an incomplete information",
    "setting , the insurance company offers contracts of the form @xmath13 $ ] that are incentive compatible .",
    "the firm s profit from a @xmath10-insuree is @xmath14= t(\\theta)-\\theta ( d - dd(\\theta))$ ] .",
    "because risk is unknown , the insurance company maximizes its expected profit subject to the insuree s incentive compatibility ( ic ) and participation ( ir ) constraints , namely @xmath15 where the rhs of ( ir ) expresses the agent s expected utility with no insurance .",
    ", there is no countervailing incentives as defined by lewis and sappington ( 1989 ) . ]",
    "the main findings of this model are as follows .",
    "first , pooling is not optimal and the firm benefits from offering a continuum of contracts .",
    "the individual with the highest risk , i.e. , @xmath16 , is offered full insurance with a zero deductible .",
    "second , premium and deductible are inversely related .",
    "in addition , the premium is a convex function of the deductible implying a larger marginal price for lower deductibles .",
    "third , the optimal coverage may entail some optimal exclusion for insurees with a low probability of accident .    though insurance contracts can include several features such as copayments and hard limits , it is worth noting that arrow ( 1963 ) shows the optimality of the premium - deductible contract .",
    "intuitively , the latter allows the best risk - sharing between a risk neutral insurer and a risk averse insuree as it is the best compromise between the willingness to reduce risk and the need to limit the insurance deadweight cost .",
    "furthermore , gollier and schlesinger ( 1993 ) show that any other form of insurance contract is dominated by a contract with a deductible and a premium implying that the deductible - premium coverage maximizes insurer s profit over all other possible forms of implementable contracts .",
    "the above model assumes at most one accident with a fixed damage and the same ( known ) risk aversion across insurees . in reality",
    ", there might be more than one accident over the policy period and every accident involves a random damage .",
    "moreover , as shown by finkelstein and mcgarry ( 2006 ) and cohen and einav ( 2007 ) , the variability in risk aversion might be more important than the variability in risk across insurees .",
    "it is also natural to consider that insuree s risk aversion is as private as his probability of accident",
    ". consequently , asymmetric information becomes bidimensional .",
    "ignoring heterogeneity in risk aversion may have serious consequences on insurance policy design .",
    "for instance , an insuree with a low probability of accident and a high risk aversion may buy a contract with a high level of coverage ( or low deductible ) and conversely .",
    "this is also known as advantageous selection in the insurance literature .",
    "in contrast , when heterogeneity in risk aversion is ignored as in the above model , this insuree should buy a low level of coverage .",
    "in addition , the distribution of damages as well as the expected number of accidents have an important impact on the choice of deductible relative to the premium offered by the insurer . in view of this discussion ,",
    "our model includes multiple accidents with random damage and heterogeneity in privately known risk aversion . in view of data",
    "availability , our model also considers a finite number of offered contracts / coverages .",
    "model assumptions    we make the following assumptions . in our model , @xmath10 is the insuree s risk measured as the expected number of accidents over the period of coverage .",
    "* assumption a1 : *    _ _",
    "\\(i ) the insuree s utility function exhibits constant absolute risk aversion ( cara ) , i.e. , @xmath17 ,    \\(ii ) the pairs @xmath18 are i.i.d . as @xmath19",
    "which is twice continuously differentiable on its support @xmath20 \\times [ \\underline{a},\\overline{a } ] \\subset { \\hbox{\\it i\\hskip -2pt r}}_{++ } \\times { \\hbox{\\it i\\hskip -2pt r}}_{++}$ ] ,    \\(iii ) each insuree may be involved in @xmath21 accidents , which conditional on @xmath10 , follows a poisson distribution , i.e. @xmath22= e^{-\\theta } \\theta^j / j!$ ] ,    \\(iv ) @xmath21 is independent across insurees and each accident involves a damage @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "the damages are i.i.d as @xmath25 on support @xmath26 \\subset { \\hbox{\\it i\\hskip -2pt r}}_+$ ] ,    \\(v ) @xmath27 is independent of @xmath18 .    by a1-(i ) , the utility function is strictly increasing and concave .",
    "the cara specification has two main advantages : ( i ) it leads to a tractable expression for the certainty equivalence and ( ii ) the attitude toward risk in changes in wealth is independent of initial wealth .",
    "these properties have made the cara utility a popular choice in the theoretical and empirical literature . by a1-(ii ) , each insuree is characterized by a pair @xmath18 which is private information .",
    "assumption a1-(iii ) specifies the distribution of accidents as poisson with mean @xmath10 .",
    "this distribution is widely used in actuarial science to model the number of accidents .",
    "the combination of the cara utility and the poisson distribution is especially convenient as it leads to explicit expressions for the certainty equivalence defined later . since @xmath10 is random by a1-(ii ) , and its marginal distribution is left unspecified , the distribution of the number of accidents in the population is a nonparametric mixture of poisson distribution thereby adding flexibility . relaxing",
    "the cara and/or poisson specifications is possible at the cost of obtaining implicit expressions for the certainty equivalence .",
    "our identification results of section 3 and 4 would still hold provided the distribution of the number of accidents belongs to the class of distributions whose nonparametric mixture is identified .",
    "see rao ( 1992 ) .",
    "by a1-(iv , v ) , damages are random , mutually independent and independent of types @xmath18 .",
    "we view the damage as being affected by exogenous factors such as bad luck , weather or road conditions .",
    "its independence with @xmath18 excludes moral hazard as ( say ) risk averse agents action might reduce the damage per accident .",
    "this issue is left for future research .",
    "section 5.2 discusses how a1-(iv , v ) can be tested in view of the restriction it implies on observables .",
    "lastly , following stiglitz ( 1977 ) and empirical papers such as cohen and einav ( 2007 ) among others , we assume the insurer acts as a monopolist . the concentration ratios and the profits made in the insurance industry indicate that it is not a competitive market .",
    "see chiappori , julien , salanie and salanie ( 2006 ) for automobile insurance and dafny ( 2010 ) and starc ( 2014 ) for health insurance . for instance , switching costs for automobile and home insurance and/or the limited number of employer offered coverages in health insurance may prevent insurees to benefit from competition . see israel ( 2005a , b ) and honka ( 2014 ) for evidence in the automobile industry . considering",
    "an oligopoly would add great complexity to the model because of the increasing dimension of adverse selection due to product differentiation .",
    "in view of this , we consider the monopoly as a reasonable trade - off .",
    "the model primitives @xmath28 $ ] are common knowledge .",
    "the timing is as follows .",
    "each insuree draws independently a pair of types @xmath18 from @xmath19 .",
    "the insurance company proposes a menu of insurance contracts of the form @xmath29 $ ] , where @xmath6 is the deductible per accident .",
    "the insuree chooses the contract that maximizes his utility and pays the corresponding premium . in case of an accident with damage below the deductible",
    ", the insuree pays for it .",
    "otherwise , the insurer pays the damage above the deductible and the insuree pays the deductible .",
    "insurer s optimization problem    the insurer offers a continuum of contracts @xmath30 $ ] for @xmath31 .",
    "integrating over @xmath18 , the insurer s expected profit is given by @xmath32   & = & \\int_{\\theta\\times{\\cal a } } \\left[t(\\theta , a)- \\theta \\int_{0}^{\\overline{d}}\\max\\{0,d - dd(\\theta , a)\\ }   dh(d)\\right ] df(\\theta , a ) \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\int_{\\theta \\times { \\cal a } } \\left [ t(\\theta , a ) - \\theta \\int_{dd(\\theta , a)}^{\\overline{d}}(1-h(d ) ) dd \\right ] df(\\theta , a),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 reflects that the insurer only covers the damage above the deductible .",

    "we can focus on a direct mechanism that maps types to contract terms , i.e. @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "the insurer , however , should choose implementable contracts that satisfy the insuree s optimization or ( ic ) constraint as well as the insuree s participation or ( ir ) constraint .",

    "the ( ic ) constraint ensures that the @xmath18-individual chooses the contract @xmath44 .",
    "the ( ir ) constraint guarantees that buying this contract is better for this individual than having no insurance .",
    "as is well known , multidimensional types leads to a complex screening problem .",
    "see rochet and stole ( 2003 ) .",
    "as noted previously , an insuree with high risk but low risk aversion might have the same willingness to pay for a given coverage @xmath38 as an insuree with low risk but high risk aversion .",
    "this substitutability between risk and risk aversion implies that a separating equilibrium , where each individual @xmath18 gets a unique coverage , is infeasible .",
    "thus , pooling occurs across insurees .",

    "indeed , the premium and deductible are inversely related as a contract @xmath38 will be always preferred to any other contract @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "thus , the insurer s objective is to find the best way to pool insurees such that offered coverages are feasible , i.e. , satisfy the ( ic ) and ( ir ) constraints , while maximizing its expected profit . , @xmath47 and @xmath48 with @xmath49 and @xmath50 , then having ( say ) the first and second buying the same coverage is not optimal for the insurer s profit . ]",
    "certainty equivalence    following landsberger and meilijson ( 1999 ) , we use the certainty equivalence of no insurance as a one - dimensional aggregation of the two dimensions of private information .",
    "a similar aggregation approach was proposed by laffont , maskin and rochet ( 1987 ) .",
    "screening based on certainty equivalence has two main advantages .",
    "first , it does not rely as much on parametric specifications of the model primitives .",
    "second , certainty equivalence has a natural economic interpretation .",
    "see also armstrong ( 1996 ) who uses the production cost for a multiproduct firm to screen consumers with multidimensional types .",
    "we make the following assumption .",
    "* assumption a2 : * _ for any given coverage @xmath38 , the difference @xmath51 is increasing in @xmath52 .",
    "_    we remark that the above difference is automatically increasing in @xmath10 .",
    "thus , individuals with higher risk or risk aversion value insurance more than those with lower risk or risk aversion .",
    "assumption a2 ensures that there will be no countervailing incentives because the ( ir ) constraint in ( 4 ) , namely @xmath53 has a lhs increasing in both @xmath18 .",
    "we note that a2 restricts the coverage @xmath38 for a @xmath18-individual relative to the damage distribution .",
    "this assumption can be verified ex - post upon identification of the model primitives .",
    "the certainty equivalence @xmath54 of no insurance coverage is defined by the amount of certain wealth for the insuree that will give him the same level of utility when he has no coverage , i.e. , @xmath55 .",
    "thus , by ( 2 ) @xmath56 the certainty equivalence @xmath57 of having the coverage @xmath38 is defined similarly as the amount of certain wealth for the insuree that will give him the same level of utility when buying coverage , i.e. @xmath58 .",
    "thus , by ( 3 ) @xmath59 the next lemma establishes the monotonicity in @xmath18 of these certainty equivalences .",
    "all proofs are in the appendix .",
    "* lemma 1 : * _ the certainty equivalences ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) are both decreasing in risk and risk aversion .",

    "the literature on multidimensional screening shows that pooling at equilibrium can not be avoided . to make the parallel with the literature on multidimensional screening with a focus on nonlinear pricing , we remark that the premium @xmath5 plays the role of the payment and @xmath69 plays the role of the quantity as seen in ( 3 ) and ( 6 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath6 is the only instrument for two dimensional types .",
    "the certainty equivalence without insurance aggregates these two dimensions into a single one .",
    "we then rewrite the optimization problem ( 4 ) in terms of @xmath62 and the ( ic ) and ( ir ) constraints using the certainty equivalences @xmath57 and @xmath54 .",

    "there is also a fifth condition that follows from the compact support of the joint distribution of risk and risk aversion and its non - vanishing density in definition 1 .",
    "this technical condition is given in the appendix .",
    "the rationalization lemma is important for several reasons .",
    "first , the insurance model with multidimensional private information does impose some restrictions on observables . in view of bunching due to multidimensional screening , and a finite number of coverages",
    ", one could have expected otherwise .",
    "for instance , in auction models , a restriction arises from the monotonicity of the equilibrium bidding strategy , which is not present here because of the finite number of contracts .",
    "second , lemma 6 characterizes all the restrictions on the distribution of observables that we can use to test the validity of the model and its assumptions .",
    "violation of a single restriction by the data would reject the model .",
    "we can then develop some testing procedures for each condition .",
    "for instance , we can test ( i ) using conditional independence tests .",
    "see ( say ) su and white ( 2008 ) .",
    "we can test the independence of @xmath359 from damage by noting that the ratio of the densities is equal to @xmath450 .",
    "we can then derive a cramr - von mises type test relying on nonparametric estimates of the densities following brown and wegkamp ( 2002 ) .",
    "condition ( iii ) implies that the full support assumption in a4 is also testable .",
    "third , ( iv ) provides restrictions on the coverage terms suggesting that we can test their optimality .",
    "this contrasts with the previous structural literature in which one assumes that the observations are the outcomes of some equilibrium .",
    "for instance , in auctions , identification relies on the optimality of observed bids .",
    "this represents a strong assumption that might be questionable from an empirical point of view .",
    "when the number of contracts is finite , we do not use optimality of the coverage terms to identify the model structure .",
    "thus , we can use ( 27)(30 ) to test the optimality of the observed coverages @xmath451 in the case of a monopoly . from an empirical point of view",
    ", the system ( 27)-(30 ) gives the optimal coverages from observables .",
    "hence , it allows us to assess the profit loss for the insurer from using the actual coverages .",
    "fourth , because restrictions ( i)(iii ) do not require that the insurer is a monopoly , they are also valid to test assumptions a3 and a4 under alternative forms of competition in the insurance industry .",
    "our paper addresses the identification of insurance models with multidimensional screening , where insurees have private information about both their risk and risk aversion .",
    "our model also includes a random damage and the possibility of multiple accidents .",
    "screening of insurees relies on their certainty equivalence .",
    "specifically , we investigate how data availability on the number of offered coverages and reported accidents affects identification of the model primitives through several data scenarios .",
    "overall , the number of accidents plays a crucial role and we identify the model structure despite bunching due to multidimensional screening and/or the finite number of offered coverages . in particular , our identification results under a finite number of coverages apply to any form of competition .",
    "specifically , they identify the distribution of inusrees risk and risk aversion for each firm in the industry . in addition , we provide all the restrictions imposed by the model on observables .",
    "an interesting feature is that optimality of the offered finite coverages can be tested separately as identification of the model does not rely on this property .    in terms of future lines of research ,",
    "first our results extend to a broad range of insurance data such as in health provided the analyst observes a repeated outcome , e.g. insurees claims . in particular , we may want to extend our identification results when damages are no longer mutually independent and correlated with insuree s private information to allow for moral hazard .",
    "second , in the case of automobile insurance , we could endogenize the car choice given insuree s risk and risk aversion .",
    "this would lead to a model explaining the car choice , the coverage choice , the number of accidents and the damages .",
    "third , our identification results are constructive and thus provide explicit equations for developing a nonparametric estimation procedure .",
    "our model restrictions can be used to develop a test of the model validity and of the coverage optimality .",
    "these restrictions are also the basis for testing adverse selection in insurance within a multidimensional private information setting .",
    "several existing data sets on automobile and/or home insurance used in israel ( 2005a , b ) , cohen and einav ( 2007 ) , sydnor ( 2010 ) and barseghyan , molinari , odonoghue and teitelbaum ( 2013 ) can be reanalyzed in view of our results .",

    "<S> this paper addresses the identification of insurance models with multidimensional screening where insurees have private information about their risk and risk aversion . </S>",
    "<S> the model includes a random damage and the possibility of several claims . </S>",
    "<S> screening of insurees relies on their certainty equivalence . </S>",
    "<S> the paper then investigates how data availability on the number of offered coverages and reported claims affects the identification of the model primitives under four different scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the model structure is identified despite bunching due to multidimensional screening and/or a finite number of offered coverages . </S>",
    "<S> the observed number of claims plays a key role in the identification of the joint distribution of risk and risk aversion . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the paper derives all the restrictions imposed by the model on observables . </S>",
    "<S> our results are constructive with explicit equations for estimation and model testing .    </S>",
