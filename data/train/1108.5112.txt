    "in a modern global qcd analysis of parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , several factors are comparable in magnitude to next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) radiative contributions in the qcd coupling strength @xmath2 . among these factors , dependence of qcd cross sections on masses of heavy quarks , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , can be significant .",
    "global fits are sensitive to two types of mass effects , kinematical suppression of production of @xmath5 and @xmath6 quarks near respective mass thresholds in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , and large radiative contributions to collinear production of @xmath7 or @xmath8 pairs at large collider energy . the first effect  suppression of dis charm production near the threshold ",
    "must be carefully estimated when obtaining pdf parametrizations in order to accurately predict key scattering rates at the large hadron collider @xcite .",
    "the second effect is tied to an observation that @xmath5 and @xmath6 quarks behave as practically massless and indistinguishable from other massless flavors in typical tevatron and lhc observables .",
    "it is therefore natural to evaluate all fitted cross sections in a `` general - mass '' ( gm ) factorization scheme , which assumes that the number of ( nearly ) massless quark flavors varies with energy , and at the same time includes dependence on heavy - quark masses in relevant kinematical regions .    in this paper",
    ", we study nnlo quark mass terms in the default gm scheme of cteq pdf analyses called `` s - acot-@xmath0 '' . here and in the following",
    ", the order of the calculation is defined by the number of qcd loops in feynman cut diagrams , so that `` nnlo '' refers to the two - loop accuracy , or @xmath9 , in the dis coefficient functions . since its inception in 1993 @xcite ,",
    "the acot scheme has undergone evolution based on the work in @xcite .",
    "the s - acot-@xmath0 version of the acot scheme is employed successfully to compute heavy - quark cross sections in recent nlo cteq6.6 , ct09 , and ct10 global fits @xcite .",

    "we then apply this scheme at nnlo to neutral - current dis production , which provides the bulk of the dis data , and for which all components of the calculation are readily available .    compared to other heavy - quark schemes available at nnlo @xcite ,",
    "our implementation aims to achieve more explicit analogy to the computation of nnlo cross sections in the zero - mass ( zm ) scheme @xcite . as another distinction",
    ", the s - acot-@xmath0 scheme quickly converges to the fixed - flavor number scheme near the heavy - quark threshold as a consequence of the amended factorization theorem , without requiring supplemental matching conditions that are present in other general - mass schemes .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] , the s - acot-@xmath0 cross sections are presented in the form that is reminiscent of counterpart zm cross sections , up to replacement of some massless components by their mass - dependent expressions available in literature .",
