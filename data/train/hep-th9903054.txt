    "there has been a great progress in string theory of the d1-d5 brane system with momentum modes along the string direction(s@xmath1 ) .",
    "this gives us a 5d black hole(m@xmath2 ) with three charges @xmath3 .",
    "the first progress was achieved in the bekenstein - hawking entropy@xcite .",
    "apart from the success of counting the microstates of a 5d black hole through d - brane physics , a dynamical consideration becomes an important issue@xcite .",
    "this is so because the semiclassical absorption cross section ( greybody factor ) for a test field arises as a consequence of its potential barrier surrounding the horizon .",
    "that is , this is an effect of spacetime curvature .",
    "more precisely , it is worth noting that a semiclassical absorption cross section can be derived from a solution to the differential equation of a test field(most often , @xmath4 ) on the supergravity side .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence states that string theory in the ads is dual to a conformal field theory(cft ) defined on its remote boundary of ads@xcite .",
    "the semiclassical limit of spacetime physics is related to the large n limit of the dual cft .",
    "a 5d black hole(m@xmath5s@xmath6t@xmath7 ) becomes ads@xmath8s@xmath9t@xmath7 near horizon but with an asymptotically flat space(afs)@xcite .",
    "recently this is called an ads@xmath0 bubble in afs and corresponds to the dilatonic solution@xcite . in this case",
    "the matching procedure is crucial for obtaining an absorption coefficient and here we need to match an ads@xmath0 bubble to afs .    on the other hand , one obtains ads@xmath8s@xmath9t@xmath7 as the other solution to the type iib string theory .",
    "this is an exact ads@xmath0 with asymptotically ads@xmath0 and corresponds to the non - dilatonic solution@xcite .",
    "further it includes the btz black hole@xcite .",
    "we point out that the near horizon limit of a 5d black hole yields the btz black hole , whereas this solution accomodates to the btz black hole spacetime as a whole .",
    "it was understood that the greybody factor calculation makes sense when one finds an asymptotically flat region as in sec.ii@xcite .",
    "hence it may not be possible in an ads@xmath0 because there is no asymptotic state corresponding to particle at infinity of ads@xmath0 .",
    "however , the authors in@xcite calculated the greybody factor for a free scalar and the dilaton both in m@xmath5s@xmath6t@xmath7(an ads@xmath0 bubble ) and ads@xmath8s@xmath9t@xmath7(an exact ads@xmath0 ) within the type iib supergravity . here in the exact ads@xmath0 calculation we choose the non - normalizable modes to obtain the greybody factor .",
    "this corresponds to the ads@xmath0-ads@xmath0 matching procedure .",
    "this expression denotes shorthand for a certain choice of boundary conditions where non - normalizable modes inject flux into ads@xmath0 .",
    "it turns out that two results of a free scalar are exactly the same . and the results for the dilaton are the same upto a factor 3 .",
    "these show a close relationship between two approaches .",
    "more recently , vacuum correlators of the dual cft@xmath10 were expressed as truncated n - point functions for the non - normalizable modes in ads@xmath2 .",

    "these are in an ads@xmath0 bubble : a free scalar(@xmath11 ) which , in the decoupling limit , relates to an ( 1,1 ) operator @xmath12 in the holographically dual theory ; two fixed scalars(@xmath13 ) to ( 2,2 ) , ( 3,1 ) , and ( 1,3 ) operators ; two intermediate scalars(@xmath14 ) to ( 1,2 ) and ( 2,1 ) operators . on the exact ads@xmath0 side ,",
    "the test fields are a free scalar(@xmath15 ) , the dilaton(@xmath16 ) , an intermediate scalar(@xmath17 ) , and the tachyon(@xmath18 ) .",

    "initially we introduce all perturbing modes in a 5d black hole background .",
    "it is pointed out that in s - wave calculation the fixed scalars are physically propagating modes and other fields belong to be redundant modes@xcite .",
    "hence we choose two fixed scalars @xmath19 and a free scalar@xmath20 as the relevant modes .",
    "we begin with the 5d black hole with three charges , @xmath21 where @xmath22 here the radii are related to the boost parameters @xmath23 and the charges @xmath24 as @xmath25 hence the d - brane black hole depends on the four parameters @xmath26 .",

    "thus we have to match the near - ads@xmath0 with asymptotically ads@xmath0 to find an absorption coefficient .",
    "we know the far - region behavior of ( [ sol - hyper ] ) .",
    "this can be found from the @xmath144 for the hypegeometric function @xmath283 , \\label{sol - hyp - far}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath284 matching ( [ sol - far ] ) with ( [ sol - hyp - far ] ) in the far - region(@xmath285 ) leads to @xmath286 considering @xmath287 , one finds @xmath288 even for @xmath42 case .",
    "hence we can neglect @xmath282 in favor of @xmath281 .",
    "this amounts to taking the flux of the non - normalizable modes .",
    "the key point is an ads@xmath0-ads@xmath0 matching in this backscattering process .",
    "then the absorption coefficient is approximately given by @xmath289 the absorption cross section for ads@xmath8s@xmath290 with @xmath201 leads to @xmath291 with @xmath292 .    in the low energy limit @xmath68",
    ", it turns out that the 6d cross sections for an exact ads - theory take the same form as ( [ sigma - phi0 ] ) and ( [ sigma - nu ] ) @xmath293 this 6d result is derived from ads@xmath8s@xmath290 . in order for this to match with the cross section of a 5d black hole , it needs to introduce a compactified circle(s@xmath1 ) in m@xmath5s@xmath6t@xmath7 . in this case one finds @xmath294 with a radius of s@xmath1(@xmath295 ) .",
    "we note that @xmath77 , @xmath296 and @xmath46 give us slightly different cross sections in an ads@xmath0 bubble , whereas these(@xmath297 ) do not make any distinction in an exact ads - theory .",
    "it seems that the s - matrix can not be extracted from the anti - de sitter space even in a limit@xcite .",
    "this is based on the fact that in an exact ads@xmath0 the asymptotic states can not be defined , due to the timelike bounadry and the periodicity of geodesics .",
    "however , the authors in @xcite showed that the correlation functions of the dual cft@xmath10 to ads@xmath2 are considered as the bulk s - matrices .",
    "the vacuum correlators @xmath298 of the cft@xmath10 are expressed as truncated n - point functions convolved against the non - normalizable modes .",
    "these can be interpreted as an s - matrix for an exact ads@xmath2 arising from a limit of scattering from an ads@xmath2 bubble in asymptotically flat space .    in this work , we show that the s - matrix of an ads@xmath0 bubble can be derived from an exact ads@xmath0 in the dilute gas and low energy limits .",
    "we confirm this from the calculation of the absorption cross section .",
    "this originates from the fact that the near - horizon equations for an ads@xmath0 bubble ( [ near - eq ] ) and an exact ads@xmath0 ( [ eq - hyper ] ) are the same form , but they have different boundary conditions at infinity . in the ads@xmath0 bubble - calculation , one uses the ads@xmath0-afs matching to obtain the absorption coefficient @xmath299 . on the other hand , in the exact ads@xmath0-calculation we use both the \\{in}-state picture and the non - normalizable mode to obtain the absorption coefficient @xmath243",
    ". this amounts to taking the ads@xmath0-ads@xmath0 matching .",
    "the s - wave greybody factor of a free scalar of an ads@xmath0 bubble has exactly the same form as that of an exact ads@xmath0 . for the dilaton",
    "we find the same form of cross section @xmath300 but with @xmath301 for an ads@xmath0 bubble and @xmath302 for an exact ads@xmath0 .",
    "let us compare our results with the others .",
    "the general formular for the gerybody factor is derived from the vacuum two - point function @xmath303 of a boundary operator @xmath12 in the effective string@xcite and boundary cft@xmath304 approaches@xcite .",
    "these give us the same result for a free scalar but for the dilaton , @xmath301 as in an ads@xmath0 bubble .",
    "consequently , the two - point correlator provides us the greybody factor in the dilute gas and low energy limits .",
    "this quantity takes exactly the same form in the cft@xmath304 and ads@xmath0 bubble approaches .",
    "further , in the exact ads@xmath0 approach one finds the same form of the greybody factor .",
    "this means that the s - matrix can be derived from an exact ads@xmath0 space .",
    "it is obvious that the conformal limit of the gauge theory(cft@xmath304 ) corresponds with scattering from an exact ads@xmath0 .",
    "finally we present here a scattering picture in an exact ads@xmath0 and compare it with the scattering of an ads@xmath0 bubble in afs .",
