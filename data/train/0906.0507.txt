    "in the last decade , systematic measurements of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies as well as large - scale structure of the universe have led to the establishment of the `` standard cosmological model '' ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the universe is close to a flat geometry , and is filled with the hypothetical cold dark matter ( cdm ) particles , together with a small fraction of baryons , which serve as the seeds of structure formation of the universe .",
    "the most striking feature in the standard cosmological model is that the energy contents of the universe is dominated by the mysterious energy component called dark energy , which is supposed to drive the late - time cosmic acceleration discovered by the observation of distant supernovae ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "currently , our understanding of the nature of dark energy is still lacking . although the observation is roughly consistent with cosmological constant and with no evidence for time dependence of dark energy , long - distance modifications of general relativity have been proposed alternative to the dark energy and these reconcile with the observation of late - time acceleration ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "while a fully consistent model of modified gravity has not yet been constructed ( see @xcite for popular models ) , a possibility of break - down of general relativity still remains and should be tested .",
    "to understand deeply the nature of dark energy or origin of cosmic acceleration , a further observational study is definitely important .",
    "there are two comprehensive ways to distinguish between many models of dark energy and discriminate the dark energy from modified gravity .",
    "one is to precisely measure the expansion history of the universe , and the other is to observe the growth of structure .    among various observational techniques ,",
    "baryon acoustic oscillations ( baos ) imprinted on the matter power spectrum or two - point correlation function can be used as a standard ruler to measure the cosmic expansion history ( e.g. , @xcite , see also for recent bao measurements ) .",
    "the characteristic scale of baos , which is determined by the sound horizon scale of primeval baryon - photon fluid at the last scattering surface @xcite , is thought to be a robust measure and it lies on the linear to quasi - linear regimes of the gravitational clustering of large - scale structure @xcite . with a percent - level determination of the characteristic scale of baos , the expansion history can be tightly constrained , and the equation - of - state parameter of the dark energy , @xmath3 , defined by the ratio of pressure to energy density of dark energy , would be precisely determined within the precision of a few % level @xcite .",
    "this is the basic reason why most of the planned and ongoing galaxy redshift surveys aim at precisely measuring the baos ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    while the robustness of the baos as a standard ruler has been repeatedly stated and emphasized in the literature , in order to pursue an order - of - magnitude improvement , a precise theoretical modeling of baos definitely plays an essential role for precision measurement of bao scale , and it needs to be investigated taking account of the various systematic effects . among these , the non - linear clustering and redshift - space distortion effects as well as the galaxy biasing can not be neglected , and affect the characteristic scale , although their effects are basically moderate at the relevant wavenumber , @xmath4mpc@xmath5 .",
    "recently , several analytic approaches to deal with the non - linear clustering have been developed , complementary to the n - body simulations .",
    "in contrast to the standard analytical calculation with perturbation theory ( pt ) , these have been formulated in a non - perturbative way with techniques resumming a class of infinite series of higher - order corrections in perturbative calculation .",
    "thanks to its non - perturbative formulation , the applicable range of the prediction is expected to be greatly improved , and the non - linear evolution of baryon acoustic oscillations would be accurately described with a percent - level precision .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the viability of this analytic approach , focusing on a specific improved treatment . in the previous paper @xcite ,",
    "we have applied a non - linear statistical method , which is widely accepted in the statistical theory of turbulence @xcite , to the cosmological perturbation theory of large - scale structure .",
    "we have derived the non - perturbative expressions for the power spectrum , coupled with non - linear propagator , which effectively contain the information on the infinite series of higher - order corrections in the standard pt expansion .",
    "based on this formalism , the analytic treatment of the non - perturbative expression is developed employing the born approximation , and the leading - order calculation of power spectrum is compared with n - body simulations in real space @xcite , finding that a percent - level agreement is achieved in a mildly non - linear regime ( see also @xcite ) . here",
    ", we extend the analysis to those including the next - to - leading order corrections of born approximation .",
    "in addition to the power spectrum , we will consider the two - point correlation function , paying a special attention on the baryon acoustic peak , i.e. , a fourier counterpart of baos in power spectrum .",
    "further , we also discuss the non - linear clustering in redshift space , and the predictions of improved pt are compared with n - body results , combining a non - linear model of redshift - space distortion .",
    "we examine how well the present non - linear model accurately describe the systematic effects on baos and/or baryon acoustic peak .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : preliminaries ] , we briefly mention the basic equations for cosmological pt as our fundamental basis to deal with the non - linear gravitational clustering .",
    "we then discuss in some details in sec .  [",
    "sec : cla ] how to compute the non - linear power spectrum or two - point correlation functions .",
    "starting from the discussions on standard treatment of perturbative calculation and its non - perturbative reformulation called renormalized pt , we introduce the closure approximation , which gives a consistent non - perturbative scheme to treat the infinite series of renormalized pt expansions , and obtain a closed set of non - perturbative expressions for power spectrum . based on this , we present a perturbative treatment of the closed set of equations while keeping important non - perturbative properties .",
    "section [ sec : pt_vs_n - body ] gives the main result of this paper , in which a detailed comparison between improved pt calculation and n - body simulation is made , especially focusing on the non - linear evolution of baos .",
    "we compute the power spectrum and two - point correlation function in both real and redshift spaces , and investigate the accuracy of both predictions by comparing improved pt with n - body results .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to the discussion and conclusion .",
    "throughout the paper , we consider the evolution of cold dark matter ( cdm ) plus baryon systems neglecting the tiny fraction of ( massive ) neutrinos . owing to the single - stream approximation of the collisionless boltzmann equation , which is thought to be a quite accurate approximation on large scales , the evolution of the cdm plus baryon system can be treated as the irrotational and pressureless fluid system whose governing equations are continuity and euler equations in addition to the poisson equation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for review ) . in the fourier representation , these equations are further reduced to a more compact form .",
    "let us introduce the two - component vector ( e.g.,@xcite ) : @xmath6 where the subscript @xmath7 selects the density and the velocity components of cdm plus baryons , with @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the scale factor of the universe and the hubble parameter , respectively . the function @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 and the quantity @xmath14 being the linear growth factor .",
