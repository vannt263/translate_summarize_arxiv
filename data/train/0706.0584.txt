    "the onset of vortex nucleation in a rotating condensate is non - trivial and has been the subject of much experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite investigation .",
    "one method of spinning the condensate is to use a rotating elliptical harmonic trap , with the presence of vortices predicted to become energetically feasible for rotation frequencies exceeding @xmath0 @xcite , where @xmath1 is the average trap frequency in the rotating plane .",

    "the static condensate solutions in an elliptical trap are a family of quadrupole solutions with elliptical density profiles .",

    "indeed , this has been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "however , depending on which procedure is employed , a critical rotation frequency / ellipticity is reached beyond which these vortex - free solutions become unstable and lead to the formation of a vortex lattice .",
    "the onset of the instability has been mapped out theoretically based on classical hydrodynamics @xcite and is in excellent agreement with experimental results @xcite .",
    "furthermore , time - dependent simulations of the highly - successful gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite have elucidated the full dynamics of this process @xcite , including the non - trivial transition from instability to vortex lattice . if the rotating elliptical trap is introduced non - adiabatically , instead , the condensate undergoes shape oscillations which can be unstable and lead to vortex lattice formation .",
    "these non - adiabatic dynamics have been observed experimentally @xcite and elucidated theoretically @xcite .",
    "a natural extension of these studies is to consider how the presence of a quantized vortex in the initial condensate affects the dynamics under rotation . to date",

    "the effect of a vortex on the collective modes of a condensate has been analysed @xcite and predicted to induce an upwards shift in the mode frequencies .",
    "@xcite showed that a rotating condensate containing a vortex undergoes similar dynamics to the vortex - free case , although the final configuration of vortices depends on the initial state .",
    "such hysteresis effects , depending on the initial angular momentum state of the condensate , have been studied in more detail by jackson and barenghi @xcite .",
    "crucially , these theoretical studies consider only the case of a vortex whose flow is concurrent with the trap rotation . in this paper",
    "we consider the rotation of a condensate containing a vortex whose flow is either concurrent or against the trap rotation .",
    "we examine the adiabatic introduction of the rotating elliptical trap , either by increasing the rotation frequency for a fixed trap ellipticity ( procedure i ) or by increasing the trap ellipticity at fixed trap rotation frequency ( procedure ii ) .",
    "we map out the onset of instability that triggers vortex lattice formation for both of these procedures , and compare to the non - vortex case .    in section [ sec : theory ]",

    "the speed at which the instability evolves will increase with the size of the real part of the eigenvalues .",

    "this shows that some regions of instability will take significantly longer to produce vortices than others .",
    "this effect will also studied in detail in section [ sec : novor ] .",
    "another source of instability to consider is the center of mass instability which occurs when the rotation frequency becomes close to the trapping frequency @xcite .",

    "although the hydrodynamic approach outlined above gives valuable insight into the rotating condensate solutions , it has limitations .",
    "for example , it assumes the thomas - fermi limit , it can only predict the stability of modes with known flow patterns , and it can not give information about how the instability manifests itself or the final state of the system . a more thorough method ,",
    "albeit more intensive , is to explicitly solve the full gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "importantly , this method allows us to simulate the time dynamics of the condensate from the initial state all the way to its final state .",
    "we employ the crank - nicholson method to numerically propagate the gross - pitaveskii equation in time .",

    "we follow the experimental procedures as closely as possible @xcite .",
    "we first obtain the initial solution with either @xmath57 or @xmath58 and then introduce the rotating elliptical trap adiabatically by following procedure i or procedure ii .",
    "the condition of adiabaticity is important because it means that the evolving condensate will access the rotating frame solutions .",
    "the non - adiabatic introduction of the rotating elliptical trap leads , instead , to oscillations between a non - elliptical and elliptical state @xcite .",
    "recent numerical studies @xcite have highlighted the necessity of rotational symmetry breaking for successful and realistic vortex nucleation .",
    "for example , if the two - fold rotational symmetry of the system is preserved then vortices must enter in opposing pairs , which is highly unfavourable in energetic terms .",
