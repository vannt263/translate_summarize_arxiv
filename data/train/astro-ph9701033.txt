    "unified models of radio sources propose that radio galaxies and radio - loud quasars are basically the same population of objects , viewed at different orientations ( orr & browne 1982 ; scheuer 1987 ; barthel 1989 ) . the nucleus is only directly visible in quasars , the radio axis of which points within @xmath3 degree of the line of sight . in the case of radio galaxies",
    "the axis is closer to the plane of the sky and the nucleus is obscured from view by material in the host galaxy , possibly in a toroidal distribution .    the powerful broad line radio galaxy ( blrg ) 3c109 appears to be oriented at an intermediate angle .",
    "the nucleus is reddened , @xmath4 , and polarized in the optical waveband ( rudy 1984 ; goodrich & cohen 1992 ) , suggesting that our line of sight passes through the edge of the obscuring material .",
    "the dereddened luminosity of the nucleus , @xmath5 ( goodrich & cohen 1992 ) identifies the source as an intrinsically luminous quasar .",
    "obscuration is also seen at x - ray wavelengths ( allen & fabian 1992 ) .",
    "3c109 was serendipitously observed with the position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) on rosat in 1991 august .",
    "the pspc spectrum exhibits soft x - ray absorption in excess of that expected from material within our own galaxy , implying an intrinsic equivalent hydrogen column density at the redshift of the source ( @xmath6 ; spinrad 1985 ) of @xmath7 .",
    "the intrinsic ( unabsorbed ) x - ray luminosity of the source ( @xmath8 kev ) determined from the pspc data is @xmath9 , making it one of the most x - ray luminous objects within @xmath10 ; only the qsos 3c273 and e1821 + 643 have higher x - ray luminosities ( and 3c273 may have a significant beamed component to its x - ray emission ) .",
    "we present here the results of an asca x - ray observation of 3c109 .",
    "the asca data confirm the results of allen & fabian ( 1992 ) on excess absorption , and allow us to explore further the x - ray properties of this remarkable source .",
    "we show that 3c109 has decreased in brightness by about a factor of two since the rosat observations , to a flux level comparable with that observed with the imaging proportional counter ( ipc ) on the _ einstein observatory _ in 1979 ( fabbiano et al 1984 ) .",
    "also , of particular interest is the detection of a strong , broad iron line in the asca spectra .",
    "this result implies that most of the x - ray emission from 3c109 is unbeamed .",
    "modelling the line as fluorescent fe k emission from an accretion disk , we are able to constrain both the inclination and inner radius of the disk",
    ". the x - ray properties of 3c109 are shown to be remarkably similar to those of many lower - power , seyfert 1 galaxies . throughout this paper",
    "we assume a value for the hubble constant of @xmath11=50 and a cosmological deceleration parameter @xmath12=0.5 .",
    "the asca x - ray astronomy satellite ( tanaka , inoue & holt 1994 ) consists of four separate nested - foil telescopes , each with a dedicated x - ray detector .",
    "the detectors include two solid - state imaging spectrometers or siss ( burke 1991 , gendreau 1995 ) and two gas scintillation imaging spectrometers or giss ( kohmura 1993 ) .",
    "the sis instruments provide high quantum efficiency and good spectral resolution , @xmath13 .",
    "the gis detectors provide a lower resolution , @xmath14 , but cover a larger ( @xmath15 arcmin diameter ) circular field of view .",
    "3c109 was observed with asca on 1995 aug 28 - 29 .",
    "the sis observations were made in the standard 1-ccd mode ( day 1995 ) with the source positioned at the nominal pointing position for this mode .",
    "x - ray event lists were constructed using the standard screening criteria and data reduction techniques discussed by day ( 1995 ) .",
    "the observations are summarized in table 1 .",
    "source spectra were extracted from circular regions of radius 4 arcmin ( sis0 ) , 3.5 arcmin ( sis1 ) and 6 arcmin ( gis2 , gis3 ) , respectively .",
    "for the sis data , background spectra were extracted from regions of the chip relatively free of source counts . for the gis data ,",
    "background spectra were extracted from circular regions , the same size as the source regions , and at similar distance from the optical axes of the telescopes .",
    "spectral analysis was carried out using the xspec spectral fitting package ( shafer 1991 ) .",
    "for the sis data , the 1994 nov 9 version of the sis response matrices were used . for the gis data the 1995 mar 6 response matrices were used .",
    "the spectra were binned to have a minimum of 20 counts per pulse height analysis ( pha ) channel , thereby allowing @xmath16 statistics to be used . in general ,",
    "best - fit parameter values and confidence limits quoted in the text are the results from simultaneous fits to all 4 asca data sets , with the normalization of the power - law continuum allowed to vary independently for each data set .    0.2truein    0.2truein    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the asca results on excess x - ray absorption in 3c109 confirm and refine the earlier rosat results ( allen & fabian 1992 ) .",
    "the asca data show ( under the assumption that all of the absorbing material lies at zero redshift ) that the x - ray spectrum of the source is absorbed by a total column density of @xmath17  ( model a ) .",
    "this compares to a galactic column density of @xmath18 ( allen & fabian 1996 ) .",
    "if we instead assume that the excess absorption , over and above the galactic value , is due to material at the redshift of 3c109 , we determine an intrinsic column density of @xmath19 .",
    "note that these results assume solar abundances in the absorbing material ( morrison & mccammon 1983 ) .",
    "the x - ray absorption measurements are in good agreement with optical results on the polarization and intrinsic reddening of the source .",
    "goodrich & cohen ( 1992 ) determine an intrinsic continuum reddening of @xmath4 , in addition to an assumed galactic reddening of @xmath20 . using the standard ( galactic ) relationship between @xmath21 and x - ray column density , @xmath22/@xmath23 atom @xmath24 mag@xmath25 ( bohlin , savage & drake 1978 ) , the total reddening observed ,",
    "@xmath26 , implies a total x - ray column density ( galactic plus intrinsic ) of @xmath27 .",
    "this result is similar to the x - ray column density inferred from the asca spectra using model b and confirms the presence of significant intrinsic absorption at the source .",
    "note that this result also suggests that the dust - to - gas ratio in 3c109 is similar to that in our own galaxy .",
    "further constraints on the distribution of the absorbing gas are obtained from the optical emission - line data presented by goodrich & cohen ( 1992 ) . in the narrow line region ( nlr ) , the observed blamer decrement of h@xmath28/h@xmath29 implies ( for an assumed recombination ratio of 3.2 ) an @xmath21 value @xmath30 . using the relationship of bohlin ,",
    "savage & drake ( 1978 ) this implies an x - ray column density to the nlr of @xmath31 , in good agreement with the galactic column density of @xmath18  determined by allen & fabian ( 1996 ) and adopted in the x - ray analysis presented here .",
    "the balmer decrement in the broad line region ( blr ) is very steep ( h@xmath28/h@xmath32 ) .",
    "although this value can not be reliably used to infer the extinction to the blr , the intrinsic line ratio is unlikely to be above 5 , suggesting a total line - of sight reddening to the blr of @xmath33 .",
    "thus , the blr is likely to be intrinsically reddened by @xmath34 .",
    "the optical emission line results are therefore consistent with the two - component absorber model ( b ) , with the column density of the intrinsic absorber being comparable with the galactic component .",
    "3c109 is the most powerful object in which a strong broad iron line has been resolved to date .",
    "several more luminous quasars observed with asca do not show any iron emission or reflection features ( nandra et al 1995 ) .",
    "the next most luminous object with a confirmed broad line is 3c390.3 ( eracleous , halpern & livio 1996 ) which is about 10 times less luminous in both the x - ray and radio bands than 3c109 .",
    "the equivalent widths of the lines in both objects are @xmath35 ev and therefore similar to those observed in lower - luminosity seyferts .",
    "this argues against any x - ray ` baldwin effect ' ( as proposed by iwasawa & taniguchi 1993 ) .",
    "the line emission from 3c109 is most plausibly due to fluorescence from the innermost regions of an accretion disc around a central black hole ( fabian et al 1995 ) .",
    "our results constrain the inner radius of the accretion disk to be @xmath36 and the inclination of the disk to be @xmath37 degree .",
    "the strong iron line observed in 3c109 , and the lack of evidence for a synchrotron self - compton continuum in the x - ray spectrum , both suggest that little radiation from the jet is beamed into our line of sight .",
    "the inclination determined from the asca data is larger than the angle proposed by giovannini ( 1994 ) based on the jet / core flux ratio of the source ( @xmath38 degree ) .",
    "however , the jet / core flux arguments are based on simple assumptions about the average orientation angles for radio galaxies and neglect environmental effects . the conflict with the x - ray results",
    "may indicate that the situation is more complicated .",
    "giovannini ( 1994 ) also present constraints on the inclination from vlbi observations of the jet / counterjet ratio , which require @xmath39 degree .",
    "the vlbi constraint , together with the asca x - ray constraint , then suggests @xmath40 degree .",
    "our results on 3c109 are in good agreement with the unification schemes for radio sources and illustrate the power of x - ray observations for examining such models .",
    "the preferred , intermediate inclination angle for the disk in 3c109 is in good agreement with the results on x - ray absorption , polarization and optical reddening of the source , all of which suggest that our line of sight to the nucleus passes closes to the edge of the surrounding molecular torus .",
    "the results on the broad iron line reveal a striking similarity between the x - ray properties of 3c109 and those of lower power , seyfert 1 galaxies ( mushotzky et al 1995 ; tanaka et al 1995 ; iwasawa et al 1996 ) .",
    "this is despite the fact that the x - ray power of 3c109 exceeds that of a typical seyfert galaxy by @xmath41 orders of magnitude .",
    "we thank k. iwasawa , c. reynolds and r. johnstone for discussions and the annonymous referee for helpful and constructive comments concerning the intrinsic reddening in 3c109 .",
