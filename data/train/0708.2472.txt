    "large solar flares are very bright hard x - ray sources .",
    "the emission originates from energetic electrons with energies mainly in the 10s and 100s of kev , believed to be accelerated in the corona .",
    "these electrons have a short lifetime in regions dense enough to generate substantial hard x - ray emission , and therefore react quickly to changes in the acceleration , transport and emission processes .",
    "while it may be hard do disentangle the contributions of the various effects in different flares , the investigation of the temporal evolution of the hard x - ray spectra in single flares is a valuable tool to study these processes .",
    "flare models and theories should be able to account for the behavior of the observed hard x - ray spectra as they change during an event .",
    "observations of the spectral hard x - ray evolution have revealed two main trends : a soft - hard - soft ( shs ) spectral evolution of emission peaks , and a progressive hardening during whole events ( shh , soft - hard - harder ) .",
    "the shs behavior of emission spikes was discovered by @xcite , and since then has been reported by many others .",
    "recently , @xcite surveyed quantitatively the spectral evolution of emission spikes during m class events , finding that nearly all rise and decay phases of the peaks show the shs behavior .",
    "the excursions in both photon flux measured at a fixed energy and spectral hardness can be very different from peak to peak .",
    "however , they show consistently a characteristic property : the spectral power - law index is a linear function of the logarithm of the flux @xcite .",
    "the shs pattern has also been observed in looptop sources @xcite .",
    "thus it is likely to be a characteristic signature of acceleration rather than a propagation process .",
    "detailed modeling of transit - time damping acceleration of electrons can reproduce the shs behavior if the effects of particle trapping in the acceleration region and escape are taken in account @xcite .    the shh behavior was first observed by @xcite , who noted that the spectral index in the late phase of a flare stayed constant at a harder value than measured during the first ( impulsive ) shs peak .",
    "further events were studied by @xcite and @xcite using data from the hard x - ray burst spectrometer ( hxrbs ) on smm .",
    "the distinctive feature of the shh evolution is the absence of softening as the flux decreases .",
    "kiplinger found two different subtypes of behavior :    * hardening during a particular peak * hardening during the decay of the whole event    in the first subtype , substantial hardening occurs during a short period , but after an emission peak the flux may soften again .",
    "events of the second subtype ( corresponding to the classic flare with a gradual phase ) typically have some shs peaks at the beginning but progressively harden afterwards . despite the name shh ,",
    "a general hardening may start already before the largest peak .",
    "thus shh is not limited to the decay phase .",
    "we note also that the two classes of spectral evolution are not clearly separated : most shh events show impulsive shs peaks in the beginning .",
    "the interest in shh flares rose after kiplinger s report of a high association rate between shh and the occurrence of interplanetary energetic proton events .",
    "more recently , @xcite confirmed the association between solar energetic particles and hardenings during the january 2005 solar storm events .",
    "the link between the two phenomena , however , is not the subject of this work .",
    "the two different kinds of spectral evolution ( shs and shh ) seem to support the view that there are two different stages in flares : an impulsive phase at the beginning followed by a gradual component , corresponding to different acceleration mechanisms .",
    "this scenario was first proposed to explain radio observations @xcite . a first ( impulsive ) phase was suggested to accelerate electrons producing gyrosynchroton emission , and the second ( gradual ) phase",
    "was linked to traveling shocks ( type ii radio bursts ) accelerating further the electrons and also ions .",
    "this idea was then used to interpret hard x - ray observations @xcite .",
    "later , the shocks were associated with coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) .",
    "occulted flares seemed to confirm this scenario @xcite .",
    "however , it can not explain the position of the dominant hard x - ray source seen during the gradual phase : imaging observations by hinotori @xcite showed that the hard x - ray emission comes from too low in the solar corona to justify the connection with type ii radio bursts . @xcite and",
    "@xcite argued that the impulsive phase is followed by two independent acceleration processes .",
    "the first happening in the post - flare loop arcade is responsible for the late - phase hard x - ray emitting electrons , and the second higher up in the corona , shock driven , accelerates interplanetary electrons and ions .",
    "this was later corroborated by @xcite using smm observations .",
    "stochastic acceleration reproduces the observed shs behavior but can not at the same time describe hardening when the flux decays .",
    "if both shs and shh phases of electron acceleration happen in the same event , why does the spectral behavior reverse ? are different acceleration mechanisms at work , or is there a further parameter in the same process that changes in the course of the flare ? to find an observational answer to this question , simultaneous imaging and spectral observations are analyzed that have become available for the first time by the reuven ramaty high energy solar spectrometric imager ( rhessi ; * ? ? ?",
    "its data characterize the spectral evolution of the non - thermal hard x - ray flux in unprecedented detail .",
    "we also compare the spectral evolution with the geometrical flare configuration , as well as the motions of the coronal x - ray source and the non - thermal footpoint sources .",

    "the coronal source moves to nw and rises throughout the event , slowing down towards the end .",
    "the reversal coincides with the start of the hardening phase .",
    "+ the observed behavior at the onset of hardening for all events is reported in table [ tab : hardeffect ] .",
    "it summarizes the analysis of the source motions in an interval of time spanning 4 minutes , centered on the onset of hardening .",
    "we conclude from the imaging observations that there is no universal trend holding for all events .",
    "sometimes , there seems to be a switch to a different loop system near the beginning of the hardening phase . on the other hand ,",
    "such jumps can also be seen during the shs phase of the events , so they need not be significant .",
    "there is also some indication that the fp motion is slower during the hardening phase , but again this does not hold for all events . in the event of 19-jan-2005 , with a simple geometry and well observed , the change in spectral behavior leading to the hardening phase does not have an impact on the morphology of the hard x - ray sources seen by rhessi .",
    "@xcite showed that the soft - hard - soft trend is expected from a transit - time damping stochastic acceleration model that includes escape of particles from the accelerator .",
    "the hardness is controlled by how fast the particle gain energy and how long they are trapped in the accelerator .",
    "harder spectra result from longer dwelling times of the electrons in the accelerator and higher acceleration efficiency .",
    "these conditions also allow a larger population of high - energy electrons to build up , leading to increased hard x - ray emission from the accelerator , identified as a part of the looptop source .",
    "this basic model predicts that harder spectra also have larger hard x - ray flux , but can not explain the soft - hard - harder trend seen as the flux decays , because these observations associate harder spectra with smaller flux .    to fit the observed shs behavior",
    ", @xcite had to assume that electrons are trapped below a certain threshold energy @xmath1 and can not leave the accelerator .",
    "the escaping electron population has a low - energy cutoff at @xmath1 .",
    "then the photon spectra _ of the footpoints _ , which dominate the non - thermal emission , harden below @xmath1 .    in the following , a simple extension of the basic stochastic acceleration model",
    "is presented which could lead to the observed spectral hardening .",
    "we introduce the additional assumption that @xmath1 increases with time in the shh phase .",
    "therefore , the photon spectrum below @xmath1 hardens while at the same time the flux arriving at the footpoints decreases .",
    "the important point here is that this also happens if the electron spectral index @xmath2 and the electron flux normalization in the acceleration region are constant .",
    "thus the new variable does not contradict the basic properties of the stochastic acceleration model .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spmod ] , where footpoint photon spectra have been computed from a given electron distribution with various @xmath1 . as expected , the photon flux decreases with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "note that the photon spectra have a nearly constant but slightly increasing hardness while the flux decreases .",
    "this extension is compared numerically to the late phase of the 19-jan-2005 event . for simplicity , an electron distribution with constant spectral index and flux normalization",
    "is assumed to escape from the acceleration region .",
    "it has a low - energy cutoff @xmath1 due to trapping in the accelerator .",
    "@xmath1 increases with time .",
    "obviously , we do not expect such a simple scenario to reproduce all the details of the spectral evolution .",
    "the question is , how much of the observed features can be explained with this simplest extension of the existing acceleration model .",
    "a non - isotropic energy distribution of fast electrons with a positive slope in energy is known to be unstable towards growing plasma waves .",
    "therefore our scenario also includes an alternative electron distribution featuring a turnover at @xmath3 , that is , a flat distribution below @xmath3 , instead of a cutoff .",
    "the electron distributions with cutoff and turnover are assumed as ,    @xmath4    the free parameters are the electron spectral index @xmath2 , the electron flux normalization @xmath5 ( electrons s@xmath6 kev@xmath6 ) , the cutoff or turnover energy @xmath1 .",
    "the reference energy @xmath7 is fixed at 50  kev .",
    "an exhaustive description of the method used for the comparison of this simple model with the observation and finding the best fit is given in app .",
    "[ app : b ] .",
    "the late phase of the event of 19-jan-2005 , from 09:32 to 10:02 , comprises 30 minutes of continuous hardening , and therefore is well suited for the comparison with the variable cutoff model .",
    "figure [ fig : vdc ] shows the comparison .",
    "the observed values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 are plotted as a function of @xmath10 together with the best - fit model curve for both the cutoff and turnover electron spectra . for the cutoff model ,",
    "the best fit values of the parameters are : spectral index @xmath11 , flux normalization at 50 kev @xmath12 electrons s@xmath6 kev@xmath6 .",
    "in the course of the decay , @xmath1 increases from 98 kev to 159 kev ( thus yielding a photon spectral index @xmath8 in the range between -2.5 and -1.9 ) .",
    "the corresponding values for the turnover model are : @xmath13 , @xmath14 electrons s@xmath6 kev@xmath6 , while @xmath1 increases from 127 to 224 kev .",
    "the photon spectra from both the cutoff and turnover model are curved downward in the fitted energy range .",
    "thus the spectral curvature , @xmath9 , is negative .",
    "it is observed to be between 0 and -0.3 , whereas the model spectra have values in the range from -0.55 to -0.25 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vdc ] , bottom ) and thus are significantly more curved .    in the cutoff distribution ,",
    "the total fluxes of electrons escaping the acceleration site are initially @xmath15 electrons s@xmath6 above @xmath16 kev .",
    "this reduces to @xmath17 electrons s@xmath6 for @xmath18 kev in the course of the decay .",
    "the total injected power reduces from @xmath19 erg s@xmath6 to @xmath20 erg s@xmath6 . in the turnover model ,",
    "the total number of particles diminishes from @xmath21 to @xmath22 , and the injected power from @xmath23 erg to @xmath24 erg .",
    "spectroscopic rhessi observations are well suited to study the spectral evolution during the main phase of large flares .",
    "the path observed in the @xmath8 vs. @xmath25 plots for the events is not simple .",
    "however , it can be broken down reasonably into a superposition of linear sections during flux rise and decay phases .",
    "while not all rise or decay phases can be so decomposed , this simple description is adequate for most of them , and permits comparison of observations and theory .",
    "there is a difference between the results reported here and the results from @xcite in the asymmetry between rise and decay phases in shs peaks .",
    "the previous results indicated that decay phases are steeper in the @xmath8 vs. @xmath25 plot than rise phases .",
    "we find the opposite .",
    "the reason is probably the selection bias : here we selected specifically events showing hardening .",
    "this hardening trend sometimes overlays shs peaks , giving rise to a soft - hard - less - soft pattern .",
    "the hard x - ray images during the events show the usual morphology of hard x - ray solar flares : a low - energy coronal source and two or more high - energy footpoint sources .",
    "the position of the footpoint sources is strongly variable : it either moves smoothly or jumps from location to location .",
    "this reflects changes in the connection between the accelerator and the chromosphere , as well as in the location of the accelerator itself .",
    "the behavior observed in the images can not be reduced to one simple scenario valid for all events .",
    "however , the observations suggest that there is no clear separation between the shs and the hardening phases : the former seems to smoothly merge into the latter . even in the cases where the emission jumps at the onset of hardening ( table [ tab : hardeffect ] ) , the footpoint behavior seems not to change radically .",
    "alternatives to the scenario presented in sect .",
    "[ modeling ] are conceivable .",
    "in particular , electron storage in the corona and slow release during the decay could be a possibility .",
    "as coulomb interactions are faster at low particle energies , the spectrum would harden with time while the released flux decreases . noting that the hardening phase in the 19-jan-2005 event lasts more than 30 minutes and that the decay of the flux in time is nearly exponential ( as seen by the fact that the @xmath10 line in fig .",
    "[ fig : lightcurves ] , panel d , is nearly straight ) , the total number of injected electrons can be computed from the total electron fluxes at the start @xmath26 and at the end @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 where @xmath29 is the observed duration ( here 30 minutes ) and @xmath30 the total injected flux . from the observed values , we get @xmath31 electrons for the turnover model and @xmath32 electrons for the cutoff model .",
    "these numbers do not seem extraordinarily high , but it should be noted that all these electron have energies above 100 kev .    would such a large population of electrons be seen as a coronal hard x - ray source in the 50 - 100 kev band ? the luminosity depends on the volume and density in the storage region .",
    "the observed footpoints in the hardening phase are separated from each other by approximately 60@xmath0 , indicating a medium sized loop .",
    "therefore , it would be visible on rhessi images unless it were excessively under - dense .",
    "thus we reject the storage model .",
    "both the cutoff and turnover model are able to reproduce the observed @xmath8 vs. @xmath25 trend , but fail to reproduce the correct spectral curvature @xmath9 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vdc ] ) . although the observation of @xmath9 is more difficult in the decay phase due to the lower signal - to - background ratio , the difference between the cutoff and turnover models and the observed points is significant .",
    "the value of the parameter @xmath9 depends on the energy interval chosen for the fitting of the model photon spectra ( 20 - 80 kev in our case ) .",
    "a lower maximum energy of this interval produces lower model values for @xmath9 .",
    "we note furthermore that if the accelerator is inhomogeneous , the electron spectrum at the footpoints is the superposition of different components with different values of the low - energy cutoff or turnover @xmath1 .",
    "the superposition of spectra that curve at different energies is less curved than individual spectra .",
    "figure [ fig : spmod ] suggests that the superposition of components with different spectral shape may in fact reduce of the total spectral curvature .",
    "thus we consider the disagreement in curvature not crucial to reject the model .",
    "we have presented results of spectroscopy , imaging and simple modeling of spectral hardening observed occasionally in the hard x - ray emission of large flares .",
    "the main conclusions are :    * the flares selected for the presence of a hardening phase also show soft - hard - soft behavior , at least initially .",
    "the hardening starts at or after the largest peak of the flares . in 3 out of 5 events",
    "it starts 2 to 6 minutes after the onset of a cme . *",
    "similar to shs peaks , hardening phases can usually be described by piecewise linear sections in a plot of spectral index vs. logarithmic flux .",
    "* there is no clear trend relating the behavior of hard x - ray footpoint sources with the spectral evolution that would be valid for all events .",
    "sometimes the location of the emission shifts when the hardening starts , in other events it does not .",
    "* in the event of 19-jan-2005 , there are only two well - defined footpoint sources throughout the whole event .",
    "no discontinuity is observed in the motion at the onset of hardening , but a general trend of slowing down , such that the fps become nearly stationary during the decay phase . * in 3 out of 5 flares , the coronal source moved continuously during the onset of the hardening .",
    "this motion was directed upwards in two near - limb events .    in",
    "the sample studied , we find a surprising lack of detailed correlation between spectral and spatial behavior .",
    "it is similar to what has been observed by @xcite in a smaller flare ( m6 ) featuring strong footpoint motions and hardening at the end .",
    "the main question addressed in this paper is whether the shs peaks and the hardening phases are the results of two different acceleration mechanisms .",
    "the results support the view that the same acceleration mechanism changes gradually in the later phase of the flare .",
    "this change has clear effects on the spectrum , but a more indirect and subtle influence on the source position .",
    "the operation of a second acceleration process later in the flare can not be ruled out , however . nevertheless , we have found strong evidence that there is a gradual change in the accelerator , transforming its behavior from impulsive ( showing up as shs peaks ) to gradual ( hardening phases ) .",
    "this is substantiated by the observations of the superimposition of shs peaks with a continuous hardening trend and of the smooth footpoint motions during the onset of hardening .",
    "the reason for the association with interplanetary proton events @xcite remains to be explored .",
    "as an aside we may note that when the footpoints drift apart , acceleration takes place in larger and larger loops . in a stochastic acceleration framework ,",
    "the acceleration efficiency of electrons in larger loops is reduced , while ions can be more efficiently accelerated @xcite .",
    "since hardening trends are well correlated with the occurrence of interplanetary energetic protons events , it is possible that the very conditions that are responsible for the hardening trends favor acceleration of protons , which may then escape into interplanetary space , with the cme controlling their release rather than acceleration .",
    "the observed motion of footpoints suggests that different coronal loops may be involved in particle acceleration during a flare .",
    "they will have different physical properties such as size , density , and magnetic field .",
    "the overall magnetic geometry of the active region will determine which loops reconnect at which time , sometimes giving rise to an orderly motion of footpoints , sometimes generating a more chaotic situation .",
    "the data suggest that as the reconnection process proceeds , some physical parameters of the acceleration site changes in such a way as to favor the production of harder spectra , rather than having a totally new process ( say , shock acceleration ) taking over in the decay phase .",
    "we thank s. krucker , y. su and the participants of the 7th general rhessi workshop for useful discussions .",

    "the hard x - ray spectrum observed in solar flares consists of two distinct components at low energies ( that is , below 10 - 40 kev ) and high energies .",
    "the properties of the low - energy component are typical of thermal emission of a hot plasma with temperature of 10 to 40 mk .",
    "in particular , the spectrum steepens with energy , and the temporal evolution follows the ( cooler ) thermal plasma observed in soft x - rays and euv .",
    "the high - energy component behaves differently and is hence dubbed non - thermal .",
    "it is harder then the thermal component and is usually fitted with a power - law function of the energy with 2 free parameters .",
    "however , sometimes the observed spectrum steepens at higher energies . in the literature , this is usually accounted for by using a broken power - law model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are some disadvantages in the broken power - law model : a ) it is not physical , in the sense that any continuous electron distribution emitting x - rays should generate a differentiable photon spectrum , and b ) the location of the break - point is poorly determined by the observations .",
    "we argue that there is a simpler extension to the power - law model which both turns down at higher energies and is smooth .",
    "recalling that a power - law function plotted in log - log space is a straight line , we choose as a `` natural '' extension to the next order a parabolic model in log - log space , described by the function @xmath33 the 3 model parameters are the normalization @xmath34 , amounting to the flux at the ( fixed ) normalization energy @xmath35 , the spectral index @xmath36 and the parabolic coefficient @xmath9 , which we will refer to as the _ spectral curvature _ although , strictly speaking , the geometric curvature of the parabola is not constant , but equals @xmath37 in the vertex and vanishes at infinity .    in the special case @xmath38",
    ", the ( unbroken ) power - law model is recovered .",
    "we note here that a log - parabolic model has been used previously to describe observed x - ray spectra of pulsars @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "the reasons for preferring the log - parabolic model over the more usual broken power - law are :    1 .   it is simpler than the broken power - law , as it allows only 3 instead of 4 free parameters",
    ". 2 .   for the vast majority of the time intervals",
    ", it produces similar values of @xmath39 as the broken - power law .",
    "it is differentiable , therefore there exists a continuous electron spectrum producing the photon spectrum .",
    "this is not the case for the broken power - law , where a discontinuity is needed in the electron spectrum , which would quickly be eliminated by kinetic plasma processes .",
    "the spectral index increases linearly with @xmath40 .",
    "4 .   it allows a better comparison with acceleration models which naturally produce slightly curved electron spectra ( like stochastic acceleration ) .",
    "therefore , we fit the spectra to a photon model with an isothermal component at lower energies and a log - parabolic component as given above at higher energies . the background is taken into account in the following way : the pre - event and post - event background spectra are measured and averaged ( in some cases , particle contamination prevented to obtain both of them , and only one was taken instead ) , yielding a reference background spectrum .",
    "the reference background spectrum is multiplied with a free parameter @xmath41 and added to the model spectrum .",
    "@xmath41 is fitted together with the other model parameters .    in large flares ,",
    "sometimes an additional hard and weak @xmath8-ray emission from electrons is observed above 200 kev @xcite . in this paper we do not report on the properties of this emission since it is not related to the hardening of the spectrum at lower energies .",
    "does this component negatively affects our fittings ?",
    "examination of the fitted spectra reveal that the fittings account for this weak , hard emission by an increase of the parameter describing the strength of the background ( @xmath41 ) by a factor of about 1 to 2 .",
    "the fittings are of good quality because the background is also weak and hard .",
    "this erroneous increase in the strength of the background has no effect at lower energies , since there the hard x - ray flux is stronger by orders of magnitude .",
    "a linear dependence of @xmath8 vs. @xmath42 with negative slope can be interpreted geometrically as a fixed intersection point of the various power - law spectra at different times .",
    "the intersection in the spectral plane ( @xmath43 vs. @xmath44 ) is called the _ pivot point _ , located below the reference energy @xmath35 @xcite . similarly ,",
    "a linear dependence with positive slope can be interpreted by a pivot point at energy larger than @xmath35 . if fitting a log - parabolic spectrum , it is the tangents to the spectrum at @xmath35 in log - log space that are intersecting , rather than the curves themselves .",
    "the description in terms of a pivot point has the advantage that it does not depend on the choice of the reference energy @xmath35 .",
    "on the other hand , the pivot point energy jumps from @xmath45 to @xmath46 when the slope in @xmath8-@xmath47 goes from negative to positive .",
    "the relation between the pivot point coordinates @xmath48 and the line parameters @xmath49 in eq .",
    "[ eq : lintrendglogf ] are given by @xmath50    since the spectra are curved in log - log space , the local spectral index  @xmath51 , defined as the logarithmic derivative of the spectrum @xmath52 is energy dependent .",
    "the spectral parameter @xmath8 is equal to the local spectral index @xmath51 at the reference energy @xmath53  kev .",
    "the presence of a strong correlation of the time series of @xmath8 and @xmath54 does not necessarily imply a strong correlation of the time series of @xmath55 and @xmath56 at energies @xmath57 .",
    "in fact , if the spectra have a common pivot point at @xmath58 , the correlation of @xmath55 and @xmath56 weakens near the pivot point , and turns into an anticorrelation for @xmath59 .",
    "on the other hand , if a pivot point exist at @xmath60 , then the anticorrelation between @xmath55 and @xmath56 for @xmath61 transforms itself into a correlation at @xmath62 .",
    "an examination of the data for the events studied here shows that in the time intervals when the correlation coefficient between @xmath25 and @xmath8 is near 1 , the correlation coefficient between @xmath55 and @xmath63 is approximately constant at energies higher than 30 - 40 kev however , it shows a strong decrease to values close to -1 at lower energies such that the transition takes place around 5 - 20 kev , near the pivot point position . on the other hand , when the correlation coefficient is near -1 at 50 kev we observe that the correlation coefficients rises toward 1 at higher energies , as these events tend to have a pivot point at energies larger than 50 kev .    therefore , the energy dependence of the correlation in the data follows a similar pattern as the one expected for non - curved spectra .",
    "this is because the observed spectra are not strongly curved : @xmath64 in all the fitted spectra , and @xmath65 in 85% of all fitted spectra .",
    "comparison of non - thermal hard x - ray spectral observations and theoretical models can be performed in different ways . in our case , we have a really simple model and a time - dependent situation . the goal of the comparison is not the perfect reproduction of every single observed spectrum , but rather a coherent description of the time evolution which should be compatible with the observed data .",
    "this is implemented by the additional constraint in the model ( as given by eq .",
    "[ eqn : modelsp ] ) of keeping a constant electron spectral index @xmath2 above the threshold energy @xmath1 .",
    "so our task consists of two steps : first , for a given value of @xmath2 , we have to find the set of @xmath66 and @xmath67 that best reproduces the data and second , we have to choose the best value of @xmath2 ( for instance by running the first step for many different values of @xmath2 and pick the best one ) .    for the comparison of the model with the data , we generate model photon spectra emitted by the model electron spectra by computing the thick - target bremsstrahlung emission assuming collisional energy losses and using the full relativistic bethe - heitler cross section @xcite with the @xcite correction factor .",
    "for the first step , the obvious strategy involves forward fitting the electron model to the observed data .",
    "this is time consuming because it needs to be repeated for all the spectra and many different values of @xmath2 . on the other hand",
    ", we have at our disposal the photon fitting parameters @xmath34 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( eq . [ eq : spmodel ] ) , which are good descriptions of the observed photon spectrum as long as the reduced @xmath39 is around one . in this case",
    ", there is no need of additional fitting in count space : we just fit exactly the same log - parabolic model to the model photon spectra ( in the energy range where the non - thermal component is seen above the thermal component and the background in the observations ) .",
    "this is faster , and delivers photon model parameters @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 as a function of the electron model parameter @xmath5 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "the comparison can then be performed in the @xmath8 vs. @xmath34 plot by a least square argument in two steps .    in the first step we held @xmath2 fixed and",
    "increase @xmath1 to generate a curve in the @xmath8 vs. @xmath34 plot for each value of @xmath5 .",
    "the normalization @xmath5 is then chosen such that it minimizes the square differences between @xmath34 and @xmath68 .",

    "<S> observations by the ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager ( rhessi ) are used to quantitatively study the hard x - ray evolution in 5 large solar flares selected for spectral hardening in the course of the event . the x - ray bremsstrahlung emission from non - thermal electrons </S>",
    "<S> is characterized by two spectroscopically distinct phases : impulsive and gradual . </S>",
    "<S> the impulsive phase usually consists of several emission spikes following a soft - hard - soft spectral pattern , whereas the gradual stage manifests itself as spectral hardening while the flux slowly decreases .    </S>",
    "<S> both the soft - hard - soft ( impulsive ) phase and the hardening ( gradual ) phase are well described by piecewise linear dependence of the photon spectral index on the logarithm of the hard x - ray flux . </S>",
    "<S> the different linear parts of this relation correspond to different rise and decay phases of emission spikes . </S>",
    "<S> the temporal evolution of the spectra is compared with the configuration and motion of the hard x - ray sources in rhessi images .    </S>",
    "<S> these observations reveal that the two stages of electron acceleration causing these two different behaviors are closely related in space and time . </S>",
    "<S> the transition between the impulsive and gradual phase is found to be smooth and progressive rather than abrupt . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that they arise because of a slow change in a common accelerator rather than being caused by two independent and distinct acceleration processes . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that the hardening during the decay phase is caused by continuing particle acceleration with longer trapping in the accelerator before escape . </S>"
