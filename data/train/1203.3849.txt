    "the hamiltonian systems form a fundamental subclass of all dynamical systems generated by differential equations .",

    "there are , of course , considerable limitations to the amount of information we can extract from a specific system by looking at generic cases . nevertheless , it is of great utility to learn that a selected model can be slightly perturbed in order to obtain dynamics we understand in a reasonable way .    finally , our results are essentially @xmath0-type results and therefore the information it provides holds only in that topology . for instance , in mathematical physics the _ forces _ are @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) objects in its essence .",
