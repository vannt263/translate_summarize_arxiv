    "magnetic hybrid materials composed of ferro- or superparamagnetic particles in an elastic matrix have a variety of fascinating material properties @xcite .",
    "one important feature in view of possible applications arises from the fact that their elastic moduli can be tuned reversibly by applying an external magnetic field @xcite , which could be exploited for example to construct novel damping devices @xcite or vibration absorbers @xcite .",
    "the materials allow to combine specific properties of ferrofluids and magnetorheological fluids @xcite with the convenience of crosslinked polymer systems : a confinement or container is not needed to maintain them .",
    "other properties studied for these systems are magnetostriction @xcite as well as deformations in nonuniform magnetic fields @xcite , swelling behavior under external magnetic fields @xcite , shape memory effects @xcite , and their value for the design of soft actuators @xcite .",
    "furthermore , some of the properties induced by an external magnetic field can be permanently imprinted into the materials during the manufacturing process .",
    "for example , when during the crosslinking procedure an external magnetic field is applied that orients and arranges the magnetic particles , a significant degree of anisotropy can be locked in @xcite .",
    "this anisotropy can show up in the optical , magnetic , and mechanical properties as well as in the swelling behavior .    by now , new preparation techniques and detailed characterization of the materials on the mesoscopic scale of the ferro - particles",
    "have lead to first results for a particle - resolved understanding of the structural and dynamical material properties .",
    "the degree of orientational coupling between the magnetic moments and the surrounding elastic matrix turns out to be a decisive parameter both from practical and theoretical points of view .",
    "this coupling is rather weak if the particles are small enough so that their magnetic moments can easily flip with respect to the particle axes , or if the particles themselves are only loosely incorporated into the polymer matrix and can easily rotate with respect to their environment @xcite . in contrary , this magneto - mechanical coupling is strong e.g.  for bigger ferro - particles that are covalently bound to the polymer network @xcite .    despite the importance of ferrogels in both applications and from a fundamental point of view as tunable soft matter",
    ", a complete theoretical description of their properties is missing .",
    "one difficulty arises from the long - ranged nature of the magnetic interactions , in particular when surface effects in samples of finite size are investigated @xcite .",
    "the long - ranged magnetic interactions are typically modeled using a dipolar form @xcite . for dipolar fluids the consequences of a finite system size and the presence of surfaces",
    "have been pointed out @xcite .",
    "another inherent problem is the simultaneous presence of many length scales ranging from the atomic or molecular scales of the polymer matrix over the mesoscopic scale of the magnetic particles to the macroscopic scales of a block of material .",
    "while there has been quite a number of previous theoretical works on the macroscopic scale by using concepts from hydrodynamics @xcite and elasticity theory @xcite , there are only very few micro- and mesoscopic studies on ferrogels that explicitly incorporate the magnetic particles .",
    "one recent attempt has been performed by camp and coworkers @xcite , who also model the ferromagnetic particles as dipoles . the dipolar pairwise interaction between neighboring particles",
    "is supplemented by a stabilizing hard core .",
    "the elastic matrix , however , enters on the macroscopic level : box shape fluctuations are penalized with an appropriate elastic energy contribution . within this approach , affine deformations of the system are assumed . in other words ,",
    "the macroscopic deformation of a block of material is affinely mapped to the displacement of each single particle .",
    "consequently , the translational degrees of freedom of each particle are slaved to the superimposed macroscopic deformation .",
    "ivaneyko et al .",
    "also used this simplifying assumption to study the behavior of paramagnetic or superparamagnetic particles that are rigidly positioned on a regular rectangular lattice @xcite . in their case the lattice as a whole can affinely deform on the cost of an elastic energy penalty that mimics the behavior of the crosslinked polymer matrix .",
    "when magnetic fields or mechanical deformations are externally imposed , the lattice affinely deforms to reduce the overall energy .",
    "naturally rotations of the dipolar particle moments are not considered in ref .",
    "@xcite because the dipoles are induced by the static external magnetic field .    at the next level of refinement ,",
    "the translational degrees of freedom of each magnetic particle are included .",
    "in other words , a step beyond the assumption of affine deformations is made .",
    "quite complementary to the modeling of camp and coworkers @xcite , the attempt by wojciechowski and coworkers @xcite puts an effort in modeling the elastic matrix on the mesoscale level but reduces the particles to effective beads ignoring their dipolar interaction .",
    "the model of wojciechowski and coworkers @xcite has shown to reproduce  under suitable initial conditions  the negative poisson ratio of dilational materials .",
    "recently , holm and coworkers @xcite have introduced a microscopic dipole - spring model for ferrogels which combines the essentials of both the elastic matrix and the dipolar nature of the particles . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a finite two - dimensional block of material was simulated at finite temperature in order to get a first insight into the macroscopic properties of ferrogels .",
    "more refined dipole - spring approaches have been employed very recently to study the conformation of flexible magnetic filaments by snchez , cerd , and coworkers @xcite . in the first work @xcite",
    ", they model a single supramolecular magnetic filament as a bead - spring chain of freely rotating dipoles .",
    "the existence of different conformations of the chains in three spatial dimensions is demonstrated by varying the strength of the dipolar interaction .",
    "a similar model is used in ref .",
    "@xcite , but there a coupling of the dipolar orientations to the orientation of the filament axis is additionally included .",
    "the phase diagram of the equilibrium conformations of a single flexible magnetic chain in a poor solvent is derived .",
    "it features compact , helicoidal , partially collapsed , simply closed , and extended open states as a function of the temperature and of the relative strength of the interparticle interactions .    in the present paper",
    ", we consider a quasi-1d ferrogel model system of hard - sphere particles of equal magnetic dipolar moment .",
    "its phase behavior is investigated in the presence of an external magnetic field with special focus on the rotational coupling between the dipolar moments and the elastic polymer matrix . for this purpose",
    "we include the dipole - dipole interaction between particles and an explicit dipolar - matrix interaction .",
    "the system is quasi-1d because the particles are displaced along one direction of space only , whereas the magnetic moments can reorient in all spatial directions .",
    "we propose a coarse - grained dipolar - spring approach , which is to a big extent analytically solvable .",
    "neglecting thermal fluctuations , i.e.  considering a state of zero temperature for the magnetic particles , this model already in 1d exhibits a phase transition between states of zero ( `` hardened '' ) and finite ( `` soft - elastic '' ) particle - separation .",
    "the corresponding phase diagram includes a critical point .",
    "we also take into account the possibility of an orientational memory concerning the dipole orientations with respect to their environment . in this case",
    "the properties of the `` soft - elastic''``hardened '' transition change only quantitatively .",
    "however , qualitatively different energetic ground state solutions can emerge as a consequence .    to illustrate this point , we consider the following situation .",
    "a sample is generated under the influence of a strong external magnetic field that homogeneously orients all dipolar moments into the same direction obliquely to the 1d - system axis .",
    "the orientational memory of this initial state is permanently imprinted into the system . when the external magnetic field is switched off",
    ", the system minimizes its energy under the influence of the orientational memory .",
    "the picture varies sensibly as a function of the magnitude of the magnetic dipole moment as well as of the strength of the orientational memory .",
    "we find that for small values of the magnetic moment or strong orientational memory , the new energetic ground state is given by a spiral arrangement of the dipolar moments around the system axis . for larger values of the magnetic moment and weaker orientational memory , instead",
    ", we can find one of the following two states minimizing the energy of the system : a uniaxial ferromagnetic configuration in which the dipolar moments are aligned along the system axis ; or an alternating antiferromagnetic - like state in which the relative orientations of neighboring dipoles are given by half turns around the system axis .    our motivation to study a one - dimensional model is twofold :",
    "first , as is known in general in statistical mechanics , any analytical solution of a one - dimensional model may serve as a benchmark to test general approximate theories and thereby provide constraints to the theory .",
    "one important example is the classic tonks gas of hard rods in one dimension where the full density functional is analytically soluble @xcite .",
    "this has been found to be a key element in constructing approximative density functionals in higher dimensions via the dimensional crossover constraint @xcite .",
    "the second motivation is to include effects of orientational memory of the ferrogel which have not yet been studied before .",
    "therefore it is useful to explore them within a simple one - dimensional model first before generalizing them to higher dimensions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we present our model and give the basic definitions .",
    "we discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] a situation without orientational memory but in the presence of a strong external magnetic field , while in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] the phase diagram and the critical - point positions are determined under the influence of an orientational memory . in the latter case ,",
    "qualitatively different ground state solutions are found depending on the strength of the magneto - mechanical coupling .",
    "finally , our conclusions are given in sec .",
    "in the following we consider a ferrogel system in a thin cylinder . the ferro - particles are distributed along the cylindrical axis and the remaining space in the cylinder is filled by the polymer such that the arrangement of the ferro - particles is one - dimensional .",
    "either ferromagnetic particles or , with a small modification @xcite , superparamagnetic particles are described by our model .    in real materials , two different situations can be realized nowadays @xcite : either the particles are physically caged within the mesh pockets of the enclosing chemically crosslinked polymer network and can rotate within these mesh pockets ; or the particles are permanently covalently bound into the polymer network so that they become themselves a part of the network upon crosslinking .",
    "the latter feature can be achieved through surface - functionalization of the particles @xcite . during the crosslinking process",
    "a strong magnetic field can be applied that aligns the ferromagnetic particles with their easy axis and magnetic moment along the field direction while the crosslinking of the polymer chains is taking place . as a consequence ,",
    "even when the field is turned off , the particles `` remember '' their original orientation .",
    "therefore , at least in the situation of covalently bound particles , an orientational memory of the dipolar orientations during the crosslinking process is generated @xcite .",
    "we model the quasi-1d ferrogel system as a 1d - chain made of @xmath0 hard spherical particles of diameter @xmath1 and dipolar magnetic moments @xmath2 . here",
    ", the index @xmath3 labels the particles .",
    "the orientation of each magnetic moment @xmath4 is parameterized by the two angles @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath5 corresponds to the angle between @xmath4 and the chain axis , whereas @xmath6 measures the azimuthal orientation around the chain axis .",
    "neighboring particles are connected by springs having an initial length @xmath7 and an elastic constant @xmath8 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] .     and",
    "@xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) are connected by a spring of elastic constant @xmath8 attached to their centers , the center - to - center distance being @xmath11 .",
    "each particle is represented by a hard sphere of diameter @xmath1 , and each magnetic moment @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) forms the angle @xmath5 with the chain axis @xmath12 .",
    ", width=321 ]    in this first approach we will completely neglect the effect of thermal fluctuations on the magnetic particles . our treatment in the following will therefore be a purely energetic one .",
    "the elastic part of our energy is @xmath13 where @xmath14 with @xmath15 . here",
    ", the angular brackets @xmath16 denote a sum that is evaluated only over nearest neighbors .",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction is given by @xmath17 in the case of superparamagnetic particles magnetized by an external magnetic field an additional factor of @xmath18 enters this formula @xcite .",
    "it can be considered by rescaling the constant @xmath19 that will only appear in this energetic contribution .",
    "we introduce a rotational coupling term between the magnetic dipoles and the distance vectors via @xmath20 where @xmath21 sets the strength of the coupling , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are , respectively , the initial magnetic moment and the initial relative distance vectors after cross - linking , and @xmath24 , @xmath25 , as well as @xmath26 . in short",
    ", this contribution means that rotations of the magnetic dipole moments towards or away from the chain axis cost energy .",
    "such a rotation has occurred , if the new dipole orientation @xmath27 with respect to the direction @xmath28 differs from the initial dipole orientation @xmath29 with respect to the initial direction @xmath30 .",
    "consequently , we can include via this term an orientational memory .",
    "it becomes important when we model the case of ferromagnetic particles that are covalently bound to the surrounding crosslinked polymer network .    in the latter case , elastic torsional deformations of the polymer network",
    "must also be taken into account .",
    "these occur when different ferromagnetic particles together with their dipolar moments rotate around the chain axis by different angles .",
    "to quantify this situation , neighboring magnetic moments are projected into a plane perpendicular to the chain axis ; then we focus on the angle between these projections of neighboring dipolar moments .",
    "if this angle has changed between the current configuration and the initial configuration , an energetic penalty arises .",
    "this whole procedure is achieved through the following energetic contribution : @xmath31 where @xmath32 gives the strength of the coupling .",
    "the orientation of the projection of @xmath4 into the plane perpendicular to the chain axis is given by the fraction term @xmath33 ( apart from an additional rotation by @xmath34 ) , and likewise for @xmath35 , see fig .",
    "[ fig0a ] .",
    "the scalar product between the projections of @xmath4 and @xmath35 gives a measure for the difference in azimuthal angles @xmath36 between neighboring projected orientations .",
    "then the difference between the current and the initial configuration is taken by subtracting the two scalar products .     and @xmath37 ( @xmath10 , @xmath38 ) as seen from along the chain axis @xmath12 ( @xmath12 is oriented towards the reader ) .",
    "for the @xmath39-th particle the direction of the projection of the magnetic moment into the plane perpendicular to the chain axis is given by @xmath33 , except for an additional rotation by @xmath34 .",
    "the azimuthal orientation of each magnetic moment @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) around the chain axis @xmath12 is measured by the angle @xmath6.,width=245 ]    finally , the hard - sphere interaction between the magnetic particles reads @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the two - body hard - sphere potential @xmath42 with @xmath1 the diameter of the particles .",
    "this stabilizes the system , because it avoids a collapse when the dipole - dipole interaction is attractive .",
    "in a situation without orientational memory , for example for superparamagnetic particles , or for ferromagnetic particles that are not covalently bound into the surrounding polymer matrix and can relatively easily rotate within their polymer mesh pockets , the energy is given by @xmath43 in this case , we will assume that the orientation of the magnetic moments is fixed from outside .",
    "such a situation can occur when the magnetic particles are exposed to a strong homogeneous external magnetic field and can easily rotate with respect to their environment , or when the particles are superparamagnetic @xcite .",
    "conversely , when orientational memory is important , for example when ferromagnetic particles are covalently crosslinked into the surrounding polymer network , the energy reads @xmath44    from now on , we assume that the magnitude of the magnetic moment is the same for all particles @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "thus @xmath47 , @xmath46 , with the unit vectors @xmath48 giving the orientations of the magnetic moments .",
    "in this section we study the behavior of the system described by the energy @xmath49 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham_1 ] ) .",
    "since there is no orientational memory in @xmath49 , this corresponds to the case of superparamagnetic particles , the magnetic moments of which can rotate with respect to the particle axes , or to the case of ferromagnetic particles that can rotate with respect to the polymer matrix without energetic penalty on the considered time scales .",
    "we start by considering a strong external magnetic field .",
    "then the orientation angle of the dipoles can be viewed as an externally fixed parameter @xmath50 ( @xmath3 ) , where @xmath51 is the angle that the magnetic field forms with the chain .",
    "looking for spatially homogeneous solutions only , we assume that all the interparticle distances @xmath11 are equal , i.e.  @xmath52 for @xmath3 . for simplicity the thermodynamic limit of large @xmath0",

    "we assume that the distance @xmath56 can freely adjust itself to minimize this energy , or , in other words , that there is no external pressure applied .",

    "the dipolar interaction is attractive , while for @xmath66 it is repulsive .",
    "the attractive case is particularly interesting , because for each @xmath51 , a critical magnetic moment @xmath67 exists such that @xmath68 .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath69 the elastic compressibility modulus @xmath60 diverges .",
    "we call this the `` hardened '' phase , in which the hard spheres touch each other so that the system can not be compressed any further . from the condition",
    "@xmath68 the critical values of the interparticle distance and of the magnetic moments are obtained as @xmath70 where @xmath71 provides a unit of measurement for the magnetic moment .",
    "it is interesting to note that , at variance with the critical value of the magnetic moment @xmath67 , the critical value of the interparticle distance @xmath72 does not depend on the angle of the external magnetic field @xmath51 , i.e.  it is a purely mechanical feature of the model .",
    "furthermore , @xmath72 is solely determined by the initial particle distance @xmath7 , whereas the hard sphere diameter @xmath1 does not enter the expression .",
    "since here we assume spatial homogeneity together with an identical orientation of all magnetic moments , the dipolar moment @xmath73 of the single particles is proportional to the overall magnetization of the sample .    in the following we use the ratio @xmath74 as a control parameter .",

    "this effect has recently been outlined in a more microscopic simulation approach @xcite .",
    "we first studied the phase diagram of this model without orientational memory .",
    "this corresponds to the case of superparamagnetic particles , in which the direction of the magnetic moment can reorient with respect to the particle axes , or to the case of ferromagnetic particles that can rotate with respect to the polymer matrix without energetic penalty on the considered time scales .",
    "the orientation of the magnetic moments is determined by a strong external magnetic field . a hard - sphere repulsion between the particles",
    "stabilizes the system . for these conditions and",
    "neglecting thermal fluctuations , we investigated the behavior of the elastic modulus and the interparticle distance under the assumption of spatial homogeneity .",
    "the behavior of the system can change radically as a function of the angle that the strong external magnetic field forms with the particle chain . depending on this angle",
    ", the dipolar interaction can be attractive or repulsive . in the attractive case",
    "we find a phase transition between `` hardened '' states on the one hand , where the particles touch each other and the compressive elastic modulus diverges , and `` soft - elastic '' states on the other hand , characterized by a non - zero interparticle distance and a finite elastic modulus .",
    "the phase transition is continuous for small rescaled initial interparticle distances and discontinuous for larger rescaled initial interparticle distances . a critical point corresponding to a second - order phase transition",
    "is identified , where the susceptibility of magnetostriction diverges with the critical exponent @xmath116 as a function of the magnetic moment .",
    "the elastic modulus is a decreasing function of the magnetic moment and goes to zero at the critical point . when the dipolar interactions are repulsive , the elastic modulus and the equilibrium interparticle distance are increasing functions of the magnetic moment .",
    "this case is not as rich because there is no phase transition .",
    "an additional orientational memory that explicitly couples the orientations of the magnetic moments to the elastic deformations changes both the coexistence curves and the location of the critical point .",
    "we investigated , in the absence of an externally applied magnetic field , the case of a memory angle such that the dipole - dipole interaction is attractive . similarly to the non - memory case , the phase diagram shows `` hardened '' and `` soft - elastic '' states , but there are quantitative differences : both the critical magnetic moment and the critical rescaled initial interparticle distance are smaller . assuming initially homogeneously oriented dipolar moments along the chain , we asked the question , to which ground state the system relaxes as a function of the orientational memory of the initial state . depending on the strength and nature of the orientational memory and the magneto - mechanical coupling , we find that the system relaxes to a uniaxial ferromagnetic , an antiferromagnetic , or a spirally magnetized state .    in summary",
    ", we find that the nature of the orientational memory and of the magneto - mechanical coupling significantly determines the ground state of the system .",
    "depending on the strength of the magneto - mechanical coupling , the magnetic moments can more or less easily rotate relatively to the surrounding elastic polymer network . from a macroscopic point of view ,",
    "the importance of such relative rotations for the system behavior has been outlined before for polymeric liquid crystalline materials @xcite .",
    "a corresponding nonlinear macroscopic description has been established @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the relevance of relative rotations has also been discussed for a macroscopic characterization of ferrogels @xcite .",
    "one of our future tasks will be to derive the connection between a mesoscopic approach as the one introduced in the present paper and the macroscopic characterizations .",
    "we stress that our results rely on a simplified model : first , every particle is represented by a hard sphere , whereas it is known already for non - crosslinked systems that an elongation of the particles can influence the structural order in dipolar systems @xcite . to mimic the presence of the polymer network , springs are attached to the particle centers , which clearly neglects the complexity of attaching the springs on the surfaces or considering the wrapping of the springs around the surfaces for large rotation angles @xcite .",
    "the latter effect is modeled by the orientational memory terms . moreover , we used harmonic springs to mimic the elastic behavior . in particular",
    "when the magnetic particles come very close , however , nonlinear elasticity effects can become important .",
    "they may to some degree mask the predicted behavior , for example the strong pre - transitional reduction of the compressive elastic modulus preceding the phase transition from `` soft - elastic '' to `` hardened '' states .    furthermore , we neglected thermal fluctuations of the magnetic particles , i.e.  we treated the particles as if they were at zero temperature . for this case",
    ", we found the phase transition between `` hardened '' and `` soft - elastic '' states in one dimension .",
    "generally , at finite temperatures and in one dimension , real thermodynamic phase transitions only exist if the interaction forces do not decrease too quickly with separation distance @xcite .",
    "the dipolar interactions in our case do not satisfy this condition .",
    "however , smoothened transitions should still be observable for chains of sufficiently finite length .",
    "apart from that , our coupling constants can become temperature - dependent . as a simple example",
    ", the fixed - junction model for ideal rubber elasticity suggests that the elastic restoring forces should increase linearly with temperature @xcite .",
    "this translates into a corresponding dependence of our harmonic spring constant .",
    "finally , our model is one - dimensional and confines the spatial distribution of the magnetic particles to one line . hence it is not able to cover important features such as the interplay of dipolar attraction and repulsion along different directions .",
    "for example , a two - dimensional array of aligned magnetic dipole particles has attractive dipolar interactions along the direction of the magnetic moments , while repulsive interactions occur in the orthogonal direction @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated theoretically , that different higher - dimensional spatial arrangements can qualitatively change the characteristics of the system @xcite .",
    "we consider the behavior of the elastic modulus for deformations along an externally induced particle magnetization .",
    "a net increase of the elastic modulus with increasing magnetization is mostly observed for real materials , in contrast to our case .",
    "it has been demonstrated that a more isotropic particle distribution of hexagonal symmetry in three spatial dimensions reproduces the effect @xcite .",
    "the latter results from the interplay of attractive and repulsive forces along different spatial directions .    nevertheless , the presented approach can be employed to study effectively one - dimensional arrangements , for example when flexible supramolecular magnetic filaments @xcite are fixed along a line .",
    "our model explicitly introduces the memory of the initial magnetic orientations .",
    "we believe it to be a starting point to investigate the physics of ferrogel systems when extending it to more spatial dimensions and including thermal fluctuations .",
