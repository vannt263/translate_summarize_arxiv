    "one of the most profound problems in contemporary particle physics is the flavor puzzle or the question whether the observed flavor structure is governed by anarchy ( essentially random numbers ) @xcite or a ( typically discrete ) flavor symmetry ( see e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate that there exist further alternatives .",
    "more precisely , we will propose that the leptonic flavor structure could arise from the topological configurations of closed strings .",
    "closed strings are a fundamental ingredient of string theory , including in particular the graviton and its ads / qcd dual , the glueball , as well as dilaton superfields with fermionic degrees of freedom having the correct quantum numbers of a right - handed neutrino ( a fact used extensively e.g. , in neutrino mass models with large extra dimensions , see e.g. ,  ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it thus seems well - motivated that topologically nontrivial string or flux tube configurations such as knots and links can contribute to the mass of closed string states , and may even dominate it . as string tension tends to minimize the string length , the knot or link length can be assumed to be directly proportional to the mass .",
    "for example , it has been shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , that the experimental spectrum of glueball candidates can be fitted very nicely by knot and link energies .",
    "an application of a knot model to flavor physics has recently been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    here",
    "we exploit another interesting feature of the knot and link spectrum .",
    "typically there exist different close - to - degenerate states with very small energy gaps .",
    "if right - handed neutrino masses are dominated by the knots and links of closed strings in a seesaw framework , large and maximal leptonic mixing may result naturally from the knot and link spectrum without the need for any flavor symmetry .",
    "now consider a generic type i seesaw model , in which the flavor structure originates from the mass matrix of the right - handed sector , which is generated by a large scale mass spectrum of knotted strings or flux tubes .",
    "consequently the dirac masses are assumed to be diagonal : @xmath1 while the symmetric majorana mass matrix has the following structure : @xmath2    this way the choice of the dirac masses is mainly responsible for the absolute mass scale of neutrinos , while the choice of the structure in the right - handed sector implies the leptonic mixing matrix .",
    "this is the general structure of mass matrices analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we assume that the heavy masses @xmath3 take on values according to the spectrum of characteristic lengths of knots and links@xcite , multiplied by a common scale @xmath4 at which knotted string configurations can exist : @xmath5 where the @xmath6 refer to the characteristic lengths of table  [ tab : lengths ] .",
    "the diagonal entries of the mass matrix are generated by the knots lengths , while the off - diagonal entries are related to the characteristic lengths of the links .",
    "the mass matrix of the three light left - handed neutrinos in the flavor basis is then obtained using the usual formula @xmath7 : @xmath8 \\left(m_1^\\text{d}\\right)^2          & ( m_2^\\text{l } m_3^\\text{l}-m_3^\\text{k } m_1^\\text{l } ) m_1^\\text{d } m_2^\\text{d } & ( m_1^\\text{l } m_3^\\text{l}-m_2^\\text{k } m_2^\\text{l } )         m_1^\\text{d } m_3^\\text{d } \\\\       ( m_2^\\text{l } m_3^\\text{l}-m_3^\\text{k } m_1^\\text{l } ) m_1^\\text{d } m_2^\\text{d }          & \\left[m_1^\\text{k } m_3^\\text{k}-\\left(m_2^\\text{l}\\right)^2\\right ] \\left(m_2^\\text{d}\\right)^2 & ( m_1^\\text{l } m_2^\\text{l}-m_1^\\text{k } m_3^\\text{l } )         m_2^\\text{d } m_3^\\text{d } \\\\       ( m_1^\\text{l } m_3^\\text{l}-m_2^\\text{k } m_2^\\text{l } ) m_1^\\text{d } m_3^\\text{d }          & ( m_1^\\text{l } m_2^\\text{l}-m_1^\\text{k } m_3^\\text{l } ) m_2^\\text{d } m_3^\\text{d } & \\left[m_1^\\text{k } m_2^\\text{k}-\\left(m_1^\\text{l}\\right)^2\\right ]         \\left(m_3^\\text{d}\\right)^2      \\end{pmatrix } ,      \\label{eqn : flavormatrix}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the common factor of mass dimension three is given by @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath10 element of eq .   is the effective mass @xmath11 observed in neutrinoless double beta decays .",
    "it is instructive to examine the structure of the effective mass matrix analytically to determine some general features of the model .",
    "as the tribimaximal mixing pattern@xcite still provides a reasonable approximation for the experimental data , we look at the general structure needed to generate such mixing angles . in general , a mass matrix that leads to tribimaximal mixing can be parametrized as@xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are real numbers .    assuming that a normal mass hierarchy can be approximated as two vanishing neutrino masses and one neutrino mass at a higher scale @xmath16i.e .",
    "a diagonal mass matrix of @xmath17this leads to a mass matrix of the form @xmath18 which can be thought of as setting @xmath19 in eq .  .",
    "this matrix is then compared to the mass matrix of eq .  .",
    "the comparison yields a set of relations between the majorana parameters @xmath20 and the other parameters : @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "if the dirac masses @xmath26 are assumed to be roughly equal the first three conditions can be fulfilled if the selected lengths @xmath27 and @xmath28 are close to each other . in general , as the order ( crossing number ) of the knots increases , the spacing decreases since the length grows roughly linearly with crossing number , but the number of knots grows faster than exponentially with crossing number .",
    "as the neutrino mass scale @xmath16 is small due to the seesaw mechanism , the electroweak scale @xmath29 factor in the condition @xmath25 needs to be compensated by making the expression in the parentheses small ; this can again be achieved by having an almost degenerate spectrum for @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "since the spectrum of knots and links features almost degenerate lengths , it is thus expected that it will provide a better fit to the leptonic flavor structure than random numbers .    the corresponding condition for an inverted hierarchy , which is approximated as two neutrino masses at a higher scale @xmath16 and one neutrino mass set to zero  i.e .",
    "the diagonal mass matrix @xmath30 , leads to a mass matrix @xmath31 comparing this to eq .   gives a system of equations that can only be solved if @xmath32 . thus",
    ", in this approximation it is not possible to generate an inverted neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "taking into account that the tribimaximal pattern is only an approximation and that the smaller mass difference is not zero , one would expect that in this model the inverted mass hierarchy should be suppressed .",
    "finally we analyze the compatibility of the model with a degenerate neutrino mass spectrum .",
    "assuming a diagonal mass matrix @xmath33 the conditions that follow from eq .",
    "read : @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 .    out of these conditions ,",
    "the last two are in contradiction with the framework of the model : the @xmath42 and @xmath43 parameters can not be zero or close to zero . the model investigated in this paper thus can not be used to explain a degenerate neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "in order to investigate the viability of the models , every possible combination of characteristic lengths up to a given knot order is sampled using a computer code .",
    "no duplicate lengths of knots or links are allowed .",
    "the parameters @xmath26 for @xmath44 as well as the overall scale of the majorana masses are not fixed by the model . as the scope of this analysis is the viability of the choice of knots and links as a source of majorana masses ,",
    "the dirac masses are chosen in a way as to minimize the @xmath45 value of the squared mass differences of the neutrinos compared to experimental data@xcite .",
    "this way , no potentially viable combinations of knots and links are discarded due to a wrong choice for the dirac masses . the overall majorana scale factor that is multiplied with the characteristic lengths of the knots and links is fixed at @xmath46gev .",
    "if the characteristic string spectrum is realized by cosmic strings , one has to respect bounds obtained by the effect of such cosmological defects on the power law index of primordial density perturbations as measured in cmb probes such as wmap@xcite .",
    "such cosmological defects arise in the phase transitions associated with the spontaneous breakdown of non - abelian gauge symmetries . the string tension , which is newton s constant times the mass per unit length , is then related to the symmetry breaking scale .",
    "if strings are formed at the gut scale @xmath47gev , then the string tension is approximately @xmath48 , which is below the constraint from cmb observations@xcite .",
    "even stronger constraints result from the contribution of cosmic strings to the stochastic background of gravitational waves which can be constrained from pulsar timing observations@xcite .",
    "these constraints require a string tension below @xmath49 corresponding to a symmetry breaking scale of about @xmath50gev .",
    "consequently we adopt this value as an upper bound for the scale confinement @xmath51 .    for the subset of models that have acceptable",
    "squared mass differences the mixing angles are calculated and also compared to the experimental values .",
    "all models with a @xmath52 for the mixing angles are considered viable .",
    "this corresponds to a @xmath53 value of @xmath54 and six degrees of freedom .",
    "the scan covering 10,692,864 possible combinations of knots and links lengths results in 321,781 models with normal neutrino mass hierarchy and 8731 models with an inverted neutrino mass hierarchy that fall below the @xmath45 limit of @xmath55 .",
    "this means that about @xmath56 of all possible combinations yield phenomenologically acceptable results .",
    "the best fit lies in the regime of normal hierarchy with a @xmath57 .",
    "the best fit model is described by the parameters in table  [ tab : bestfitmodel ] .",
    "this has to be compared with a model based on random numbers : the same model structure is assumed , but the list of characteristic lengths is replaced by a list of random numbers between @xmath58 and the largest knot length of the actual list of knot lengths .",
    "this is repeated for 10 sets of random numbers .",
    "the total number of acceptable models is @xmath59 of all tested combinations . in all cases ,",
    "the best fit model is in the normal hierarchy regime and the total number of viable models with a normal neutrino mass hierarchy is much larger than the number of models with an inverted mass hierarchy .",
    "there are two effects that explain this discrepancy : in our models with an inverted mass hierarchy , @xmath0 is usually predicted to be close to maximal , while the models with normal mass hierarchy predict a naturally small @xmath0 .",
    "in addition to this , the relative number of models with a normal neutrino mass hierarchy is even larger in the case of knots and links .",
    "this can be explained by the conditions that follow from eq .  , which lead to the spectrum of knots and links being able to fit the requirements for a normal mass hierarchy easier than random numbers .    for all random cases considered the total number of acceptable models is lower than the total number of acceptable models in the case of knots and links .",
    "this means that the models using the characteristic lengths of knots and links are more suitable to fit the neutrino data than a fit using random numbers .        for the models with a normal neutrino mass hierarchy .",
