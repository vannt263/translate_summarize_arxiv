    "the mixing arises from the fact that the photon and nucleon momenta in the laboratory frame are not aligned .",

    "the mixing is the first cause of modification of the ratio @xmath60 .",
    "moreover , the usual binding and fermi - motion effects , which are implicitly contained in our convolution expressions , also introduce a nuclear effect .",
    "the original hermes effect was reported at small @xmath2 .",
    "their reanalysis indicates that such a large nuclear modification of @xmath60 does not exist anymore .",

    "our predictions are important for suggesting future experimental efforts for finding such a nuclear modification of @xmath60 .",
    "in order to calculate the nuclear structure functions in the previous section , we need the spectral function for the nucleus . because @xmath75n is one of the nuclei investigated by the hermes collaboration ,",
    "we take this nucleus as an example . at this stage , we restrict to the @xmath2 region , @xmath76 , where we may not need a sophisticated model for the @xmath75n structure .",

    "the nuclear model should be good enough at least to reproduce gross features of the nucleus , such as nuclear charge radius and binding energy .",
    "as such a model , a density - dependent hartree - fock model by bonche , koonin , and negele ( bkn ) @xcite is used in the following numerical analysis . in the used bkn code , the coulomb interaction is turned off , so that the single particle energies and wave functions are the same for the proton and neutron . using calculated wave functions and energies , we obtain the binding energy and the root - mean - square radius as about @xmath83 mev and 2.54 fm .",
    "these results agree with the experimental values about @xmath84 mev @xcite and 2.45 fm @xcite , so that the model can be used for our studies of the nuclear structure functions .",
    "next , we briefly explain the actual integration for evaluating the transverse and longitudinal structure functions in a nucleus .",
    "using the spectral function in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : sp ] ) and changing the integration variable to @xmath41 and @xmath85 , we have a typical integral of the following form : @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 . in evaluating the integral ,",

    "in this way , the integrations are calculated numerically with the hartree - fock wave functions and the following structure functions for a nucleon .    as the leading - order expression of parton distributions ,",
    "we take those from the mrst ( martin , roberts , stirling , and thorne ) parametrization in 1998 @xcite .",
    "the structure function @xmath3 of the proton is calculated by @xmath94 .",
    "isospin symmetry is used for the parton distributions in calculating @xmath3 of the neutron .",
    "since @xmath75n is isoscalar and the wave functions are identical for the proton and neutron in the used model , we do not have to take into account the difference between the proton and the neutron structure functions .",
    "the nucleon structure function is defined by the average of the proton and neutron structure functions : @xmath95 . using this @xmath96 and the slac parametrization of 1990 @xcite for @xmath97 , we calculate the transverse and longitudinal structure functions by @xmath98 $ ] and eq .",

    "the nuclear modification remains small at @xmath0=1 gev@xmath101 .",
    "however , because of the nucleon transverse motion , the transverse - longitudinal admixture gives rise to about 5% positive modification at medium @xmath2 ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "this 5% effect is consistent with the value of the mixing coefficient @xmath110 . at larger @xmath0 ( = 10 and 100 gev@xmath101 ) , the admixture effects become smaller .",

    "therefore , the overall admixture correction is of the order of 3 and 1% for @xmath0=10 and 100 gev@xmath101 , respectively .",
    "the dashed curves in fig . [ fig : rratio ] indicate that the correction from the spectral function also contributes to the modification .",

    "the physical origin of the modification has been clarified in this paper .",
