    "spatial arrangements of particles in many - body systems exhibit wide diversity that arises from the interactions that are present , and from the prior history of those systems .",
    "one of the available analytical tools that has proved useful for describing those spatial arrangements , whether for individual cases or for ensemble averages , is the set of collective density variables .",
    "these are conventionally defined for @xmath9 identical particles in the following way :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 denotes the location of particle @xmath12 , and the @xmath13 are the wave vectors appropriate for the containing volume and boundary conditions .",
    "collective density variables have played an important role in a variety of problems in condensed matter physics .",
    "specifically , they have been used in illustrating that large - scale density variations in superfluid @xmath8 are in fact long - wavelength phonons  @xcite .",
    "introduction of the appropriate collective coordinates is natural in describing independent plasma oscillations brought about by the long - range coulomb interactions between electrons in metals  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , application of these variables has aided in the derivation of self - consistent integral equations for pair correlation functions in classical fluids  @xcite , in obtaining corrections to the random phase approximation for the electron gas  @xcite , and in generating classical ground states for particle systems  @xcite .",

    "( [ equation1 ] ) from particle positions to collective variables entails nontrivial mathematical properties that are still incompletely understood  @xcite .",
    "the present paper is devoted to clarifying some of the remaining issues .",
    "many physical applications of collective density variables focus on the structure factor @xmath1 for the many - particle system involved :    @xmath14    where the real quantities @xmath0 are the following :    @xmath15 . \\label{equation3}\\ ] ]    in view of the fact that the phase angles of the @xmath16 are irrelevant for most applications , it suffices to focus attention on the @xmath0 s .",
    "a considerable challenge involves determining what sets of @xmath0 values correspond to attainable particle configurations , and how to generate and describe those special configurations , including ground - state structures . in particular , it is important to understand the extent to which these real collective variables at small wave vectors @xmath13 are controllable .",
    "although we begin by considering the general situation , much of the attention in the following will involve the examination of `` hyperuniform '' systems  @xcite , namely those in the infinite system limit for which :    @xmath17    this defining characteristic of hyperuniformity states that the usual mean - square particle - number fluctuations increases less than @xmath18 , where @xmath19 denotes the linear size of an observation window and @xmath20 is the space dimension  @xcite .",
    "considering the fact that various hyperuniform physical systems exhibit characteristic @xmath13 dependence of their structure factors near the origin ( _ e.g. _ , the ground state of liquid @xmath21  @xcite as well as random , jammed hard - sphere packings  @xcite and the early universe  @xcite ) , it becomes important to understand what @xmath9-particle configurational implications stem from these specific @xmath1 forms .",
    "this has guided the analysis detailed below .",
    "because our objective is to prescribe @xmath3 [ or , equivalently @xmath22 and then to find many - particle configurations that may correspond to such a target structure function , this problem can be regarded to be an _",
    "inverse problem_. the analogous inverse problem in real space in which the pair correlation function is prescribed has received considerable attention in the last several years @xcite .",
    "this class of inverse problems has come to be called _ construction _ problems @xcite . _ a priori _ , a prescribed pair structural function is not necessarily realizable by a many - particle configuration .",
    "a solution to the construction problem therefore provides numerical evidence for realizabilty of a target pair structural function .",
    "thus , the present investigation has important implications for the _ realizability _ problem of statistical mechanics , which seeks to determine the necessary conditions that a prescribed pair correlation [ or its equivalent fourier representation , @xmath23 must possess in order for it to correspond to a many - particle system @xcite .",
    "the present paper extends our earlier one - dimenisonal @xcite and two - dimensional @xcite studies of collective coordinate control of density distributions .",
    "our focus in these two studies was to consider continuous and bounded pair potentials and to constrain the corresponding collective parameters @xmath0 , with wave vector @xmath13 magnitudes at or below a chosen cutoff , to their absolute minimum values .",
    "in other words , density fluctuations for those @xmath13 s were completely suppressed . in our two - dimensional investigation @xcite",
    ", we were able to distinguish between three different ground - state structural regimes as the number of constrained wave vectors were increased - disordered , wavy crystalline , and crystalline regimes .",
    "evidence for a disordered or irregular ground state , a counterintuitive notion , had heretofore not been provided . in the present work ,",
    "we extend these results not only to three - dimensional ground state problems but to more general two- and three - dimensional hyperuniform many - particle systems .",
    "the next section provides some of the mathematical structure needed to understand how fixing values of sets of the real collective variables @xmath0 exerts control over the allowed many - particle configurations . a description of our numerical methods for analyzing this problem follows in section  [ sec : section3 ] .",
    "results of the numerical study cover both two- and three - dimensional systems , and are presented respectively in sections  [ sec : section4 ] and  [ sec : section5 ] . among other results , we provide specific examples of interaction potentials whose classical ground state are configurationally degenerate and disordered . our conclusions and discussion of some remaining issues appear in section  [ sec : section6 ] .",

    "furthermore , suppose that periodic boundary conditions apply .",
    "the applicable wave vectors have components :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 = @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 as needed .",
    "it is easy to see that the @xmath0 must obey the following properties :    @xmath32    furthermore , these collective variables are necessarily confined to the range :    @xmath33    and as they vary over this range they measure the magnitude of density inhomogeneity at wave vector @xmath13 in the @xmath9-particle system .",
    "although the number of collective variables is infinite , the @xmath9-particle system possesses only @xmath34 configurational degrees of freedom , where @xmath20 is the euclidean space dimension ( @xmath20 = 1,2,3 ) .",
    "consequently , it is unreasonable to suppose ( barring special circumstances ) that generally all @xmath0 s could be independently controlled .",

    "the emergence of an effective repulsive core for increasing values of @xmath99 is apparent , reminiscent of a similar effect observed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the two - dimensional case .",
    "the former studies of collective coordinate properties presented in refs .  @xcite and  @xcite were restricted to one- and two - dimensional point patterns , and documented the effect of forcing sets of the collective variables for @xmath122 to their individual absolute minima .",
    "the present investigation extends that analysis in two distinct directions , by considering point patterns in three dimensions , and by examining the effect of constraining the collective variables around the @xmath13-space origin to chosen increments above their absolute minima .",

    "although previous attempts have produced configurations for which the associated structure factor @xmath125 with @xmath126  @xcite , our analysis also yields specific configurations that exhibit @xmath125 with @xmath127 .",
    "in addition to the specific cases reported in this paper , our studies reveal that a considerably wider range of constrained @xmath0 patterns can be imposed on many - particle systems . for example , forcing @xmath0 to equal 0 instead of its absolute minimum @xmath128/2 , reveals a tendency to produce a high degree of disorder in the generated particle systems .     when @xmath117 0 , increasing the fraction @xmath99 of system degrees of freedom subject to collective variable constraints was found in one and two dimensions to drive the point particle configurations more and more toward crystalline periodicity .",
    "the present extension not surprisingly shows that the same qualitative trend applies to three dimensions as well .",
    "however the `` wavy crystalline '' regime reported in ref .",
    "@xcite to separate the two - dimensional low-@xmath99 disordered regime from the high-@xmath99 crystalline regime appears to have no three - dimensional analog . as @xmath99 increases for @xmath117 0 cases in three dimensions , the relevant @xmath49 landscape on which numerical absolute minimization needs to be carried out develops an increasing density of relative minima , thereby inhibiting ( but not necessarily preventing ) the search for qualifying particle configurations .",
    "for the few cases considered , increasing @xmath45 above zero at constant @xmath99 has the effect of disrupting the tendency toward crystalline order .",
    "a characteristic feature of the various cases examined , provided that the fraction @xmath99 is below its maximum value to yield valid solutions , is degeneracy of the final particle configurations .",
    "this is obvious when several independent initial configurations for a case considered are individually subjected to the same minimization operation , and then produce geometrically distinct final patterns .",
    "the minimized objective functions @xmath42 and @xmath49 , for @xmath124 0 and @xmath117 0 cases respectively , indicate that these configuration sets are degenerate classical ground states , including disordered ones , for specific potential energy functions . when @xmath42 is used , that potential function consists of four , three and two body components , while for @xmath49 only two - body components arise .",
    "this offers a specific constructive method to achieve degenerate - ground - state potentials , a subject recently discussed by st  @xcite .",
    "the present collective variable approach may also supply some insight into the existence of potentials whose classical ground states are amorphous , or at least highly irregular . start with a small-@xmath99 constraint case , satisfied with an irregular point - particle configuration .",
    "this specific configuration will display specific @xmath0 values for the unconstrained range @xmath107 .",
