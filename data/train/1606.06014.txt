    "the increasing reliance on partly unpredictable renewable power supply has prompted the revision of the procedures used for power system operations .",
    "this is the case , for example , of the tool used by system operators to decide the commitment of power plants , that is , to solve the so - called _ unit commitment problem _ ( uc ) .",
    "two - stage stochastic programming @xcite and robust optimization @xcite have become the most popular and explored techniques of optimization under uncertainty to improve unit - commitment decisions in terms of both cost - efficiency and system reliability .",
    "the formulation and solution of the unit commitment problem using either stochastic programming or robust optimization  the result of which is typically referred to as _",
    "stochastic _ and _ robust unit commitment _",
    ", respectively has been subject of numerous studies by the scientific community ; see , for instance , @xcite , among many others and variants .",
    "essentially , the stochastic unit commitment problem ( suc ) makes use of a probabilistic model for the uncertain input factors such as demand , equipment failures and partly - predictable renewable power production to minimize a certain quantile of the induced system cost distribution , usually , its expectation .",
    "most often than not , this probabilistic model takes the form of a set of scenarios that describe plausible realizations of such random factors . in order for the stochastic solution to be reliable ,",
    "the amount of scenarios that need to be considered must be large , which may render an intractable optimization problem , or carefully generated , which motivates the topic of _ scenario reduction techniques _ @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the probabilistic model from which these scenarios may be drawn may carry , in itself , some level of uncertainty as well .",
    "in contrast , the robust unit commitment problem ( ruc ) seeks a commitment plan that allows the system to withstand the worst - case realization of the uncertain factors at a minimum cost .",
    "while this approach saves the decision - maker from having to probabilistically characterize these factors , it may yield too conservative solutions as the worst - case scenario rarely occurs .    in recent years",
    ", several methods have been proposed to make decisions under uncertainty that perform _ relatively well _ under the premises of _ both _ the stochastic and the robust approaches , that is , in expectation and for the worst case .",
    "illustrative examples of these methods can be found in @xcite , where hybrid stochastic - robust solution strategies are developed for optimal air - quality and municipal solid - waste management , electricity trading for power microgrids and energy contracting for a portfolio of renewable power generation technologies , respectively .",
    "what makes all these solution strategies _ hybrid _ is that some of the uncertain parameters are assumed to follow certain probability distributions , while others are solely known to belong to some uncertainty sets .    within the context of the unit commitment problem",
    ", we highlight the work in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the authors in @xcite propose a mathematical formulation that delivers the unit - commitment plan that minimizes a user - controlled weighted sum of the expected and the worst - case costs . the solution approach introduced in @xcite ,",
    "even if presented as a method to tackle the stochastic unit commitment problem , seeks to determine a unit - commitment plan that is robust against an _ ambiguous _ probability distribution of renewable energy generation , an ambiguity that is the result of the always limited availability of data and that is modeled in practice as a vector of imperfectly known probabilities .",
    "thus , as the amount of historical data increases , the ambiguity of such a probability distribution diminishes and so does the need for robustness and the degree of conservatism of the stochastic unit - commitment solution .",
    "this approach can also be regarded as a form of _ distributionally robust optimization _",
    "@xcite .",
    "our work shares with @xcite the aim of finding a solution to the stochastic unit commitment problem that is robust in some sense , but our motivation and the methodology we propose to this end are essentially different .",
    "we assume that the probability distributions of the uncertain parameters  in our case , the wind power production  are known , but that , as it normally occurs in practice , computationally tractability only allows us to solve the stochastic unit commitment problem for a scenario - based approximation of such distributions . in principle",
    ", we shall consider a large number of scenarios for this approximation to be accurate enough . in any case , we cluster these scenarios using the _ k - means clustering algorithm _ @xcite , which has been reported to feature good performance in similar contexts @xcite .",
    "each of the so - obtained clusters is referred to as a _",
    "partition_. we then formulate and solve a two - stage unit - commitment problem that minimizes the expected value of the system operating costs , where the expectation is taken over the collection of worst - case scenarios within each partition .",
    "the probability assigned to each of these worst - case scenarios is equal to the probability of the partition it belongs to , which is , in turn , computed by summing up the probabilities of the scenarios that form part of the partition in question .    for convenience ,",
    "we employ the term _ hybrid unit commitment problem _ and the acronym huc to refer to the proposed reformulation of the uc problem .",
    "this reformulation brings two major advantages , namely :    1 .",
    "it allows finding solutions to the two - stage unit commitment problem with different degrees of conservatism by changing the number of partitions .",
    "in fact , if only one partition is considered , the huc delivers the robust unit - commitment solution .",
    "in contrast , if the number of partitions is made to coincide with the number of scenarios , the huc solution boils down to the stochastic unit - commitment plan .",
    "it is amenable to decomposition and paralellization at various levels and , hence , it can be efficiently solved .",
    "indeed , each partition is processed in parallel .",
    "furthermore , based on the column - and - constraint generation procedure described in  @xcite , we develop a master - subproblem decomposition scheme to find those scenarios within each partition that , considered together , result in the worst - case system operating cost for that partition .",
    "finally , we solve the huc problem for a substantially smaller set of scenarios , namely , those picked up from each partition . in this sense ,",
    "our solution approach works similarly to a scenario reduction technique that is robust against the error intrinsic to the reduction process .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec1 ] begins by providing mathematical formulations for the scenario - based two - stage stochastic and robust unit commitment problems , in that order , and finishes with the formulation of the proposed hybrid unit commitment problem .",
    "furthermore , in this section we explain how we use the k - means clustering method to construct the partitions in the huc model and how these can be employed to control the degree of conservatism of the resulting unit - commitment plan .",

    "in the two - stage unit commitment problem under uncertainty , decision variables are divided into two groups .",
    "the first group constitutes the commitment plan itself and consists of the 0/1 variables @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , which determine the on / off status , the start - up , and the shutdown of generating unit @xmath2 in time period @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "these decisions are to be made , in general , one day in advance of the actual delivery of electricity and , in any case , before the realization of the uncertain factors . in this paper",
    ", we consider for simplicity that the system uncertainty stems only from the wind power production , which is modeled as a finite set @xmath15 of scenarios @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",
    "the second - stage decision variables , namely , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 determine the economic dispatch of the conventional generating units , the amount of load that is involuntarily shed , the amount of wind power production that is curtailed , and the voltage angles at the network nodes , respectively .",
    "these variables adapt to the specific realization of the uncertainty and as such , are augmented with the scenario index @xmath5 .",

    "finally , constraints   and constitute variable declarations .      in this section",
    "we present a scenario - based formulation of the two - stage robust unit commitment problem , which writes as follows : @xmath27 in ( [ 37])([75 ] ) , the auxiliary variable @xmath28 equals the worst - case dispatch cost at the optimum .",
    "note that this variable is bounded from below by a finite set of linear constraints ( [ 38 ] ) , one per scenario , that involve the second - stage decision variables @xmath29 and @xmath19 .",
    "thus , the objective of the scenario - based ruc problem ( [ 37])([75 ] ) is to minimize the total system operating cost for the worst - case scenario of the uncertainty .    in the following section , we introduce the proposed hybrid formulation of the two - stage unit commitment problem under uncertainty .",
    "the two - stage unit commitment formulation that we propose is based on splitting the finite set of scenarios @xmath15 into @xmath30 partitions , each with a probability equal to the sum of probabilities of the scenarios that form part of it .",
    "the objective is then to minimize the expected system operating cost over the scenarios that deliver the worst - case dispatch cost within each partition . these scenarios , one per partition ,",
    "are assigned a probability of occurrence equal to the probability of the partition they belong to .",
    "let @xmath31 denote the original scenario set , where @xmath32 is the total number of scenarios .",

    "since @xmath15 is a discrete probability space with probability measure @xmath40 , @xmath41 , the probability @xmath42 associated with each partition @xmath38 , @xmath39 , depends on the number of scenarios that pertain to it and is computed as : @xmath43    therefore , the proposed hybrid two - stage unit commitment problem writes as follows :    @xmath44 & \\hspace{0.8 cm } + \\sum_{p \\in p } \\rho_p \\theta_p \\label{46 }   \\allowdisplaybreaks   \\\\[0.3 cm ] & \\text{s.t.}\\hspace{0.2 cm }   \\theta_p \\geq \\sum_{t\\in t}\\sum_{g\\in g}c^{v}_{g } p_{g , t , w}+\\sum_{t\\in t}\\sum_{l\\in l } c^{l } l^{sh}_{l , t , w } , \\label{47 }    \\\\   & \\quad\\enskip ( \\forall",

    "this way , problem ( [ 46])([76 ] ) is expected to yield a unit - commitment plan that is `` in between '' the robust and the stochastic unit - commitment solutions in terms of the expected and the worst - case system operating cost .",
    "furthermore , the closeness of the huc solution to the stochastic and robust unit - commitment plans , and consequently its degree of conservatism , are controlled by the number @xmath30 of partitions or clusters into which the scenarios are grouped .",
    "indeed , if the number of partitions equals the number of scenarios , that is , @xmath46 , the huc model ( [ 46])([76 ] ) reduces to   and the stochastic solution is obtained .",
    "in contrast , if only one single partition is considered ( @xmath47 ) , we have that @xmath48 and therefore , problem ( [ 46])([76 ] ) boils down to the scenario - based robust unit - commitment formulation ( [ 37])([75 ] ) . as a result , the huc solution coincides with the robust solution in such a case .",
    "hence , we can increase the degree of conservatism of the huc solution by diminishing the number of partitions , and vice versa .",
    "for @xmath49 , however , how efficiently the huc solution transits from the robust to the stochastic unit - commitment plan , as @xmath30 increases , depends on the performance of the clustering technique .",
    "we use the k - means algorithm @xcite , which is an efficient non - hierarchical method to cluster a data set into @xmath30 groups . in our case",
    ", the k - means algorithm assigns each scenario @xmath17 to the partition @xmath38 , with @xmath50 , with the nearest mean .",
    "the k - means algorithm has been reported to showcase the best performance in a probabilistic production cost model in @xcite and in transmission and generation expansion planning in @xcite , compared to several other clustering techniques .",
    "furthermore , this previously reported evidence agrees with what we observe in our numerical experiments .",
    "it is well known that the unit commitment problem is mixed - integer , np - hard , and generally requires long solution times .",
    "this is especially true for realistic instances of the two - stage unit commitment problem under uncertainty . in the following",
    "we describe the parallelization - and - decomposition scheme that we have designed to efficiently solve the proposed huc formulation ( [ 46])([76 ] ) . for ease of exposition",
    ", we divide this description in two parts . in the first one ,",
    "we explain how problem ( [ 46])([76 ] ) is decomposed per partition and scenario , while in the second part we elaborate on how the solution to the decomposed problem is parallelized .",
    "[ bda ]      let us consider a certain partition @xmath39 that comprises the subset of scenarios @xmath38 .",
    "note that , for determining the optimal solution to the huc problem ( [ 46])([76 ] ) , we only need those ( hopefully few ) scenarios in @xmath38 that deliver the worst - case dispatch cost within partition @xmath6 for any feasible unit - commitment plan .",
    "let @xmath51 denote the subset of those scenarios .",
    "the idea is to find such a reduced set @xmath52 , a task that can be performed in parallel for each partition @xmath39 .    to build @xmath52 from @xmath38 , the latter being the outcome of the k - means clustering algorithm",
    ", we develop a master - subproblem decomposition scheme based on the column - and - constraint generation procedure described in @xcite . in the sequel",
    "we will refer to this decomposition scheme as _ primal cut algorithm _",
    "after the solution strategy introduced in @xcite whereby the master problem is gradually enlarged with the addition of cuts expressed in terms of the primal variables .",

    "a pseudocode for the proposed decomposition scheme , which hereinafter we refer to as _ scenario partition and decomposition algorithm _ ( spda ) , is provided in algorithm [ chalgorithm ] .",

    "this confers robustness to the solution of the proposed huc problem .",
    "moreover , the last command line in spda , which involves solving the huc model for the reduced scenarios sets @xmath99 , could be carried out as well via further decomposition ( see , for instance , @xcite ) , although this possibility has not been explored in this paper .      in spda",
    "both the outer `` for - loop''and the solution to the w - indexed subproblems are amenable to parallelization . for this purpose , we make use of the dtu high performance computing ( hpc ) facility @xcite . we create @xmath30 jobs ,",
    "each representing an instance of the primal cut algorithm for each of the @xmath30 partitions into which we divide the scenario set @xmath15 .",
    "these jobs are simultaneously submitted to the hpc cluster , where they are concurrently executed , as there is no need for communication in between the workers ( nodes or cores ) .",
    "we submit each of the @xmath30 jobs to a different node , using the same amount of resources per node . within every node",
    ", the subproblems are solved in a multi - threaded environment using the gather - update - solve - scatter facility in gams @xcite .",
    "this tool allows treating each subproblem , one per scenario in the partition under consideration , as a different parametrization of the same linear programming model , which is then generated only once by gams .",
    "likewise , the solutions to all the subproblems ( or portions thereof ) are retrieved back to gams in a single transaction .",
    "figure [ paralelization ] provides a graphical illustration of how spda is parallelized and run using a multi - machine configuration within the dtu hpc cluster .",
    "in the following the quality of the unit - commitment plan provided by the proposed huc formulation is first tested on the ieee 14-node power system @xcite and the ieee 3-area rts-96 system @xcite in section  [ resultsquality ] .",
    "the latter power system is then used to evaluate the performance of spda in section  [ resultsperformance ] .",
    "the ieee 14-node system comprises 14 nodes , 5 generators , 20 lines and 11 loads .",
    "we also add one wind farm to node 5 , whose power production is modeled by the ten scenarios provided in table [ wpp ] .    the ieee 3-area rts-96 system consists of 72 nodes , 96 generators , 107 lines , and 51 loads . besides , we add 15 wind farms of 200-mw capacity each and location given by table [ wfloc ] .",
    "thus , the wind power capacity represents 29% of the total generating capacity installed in the power system .",
    "the technical characteristics of the generating units , the demand and the transmission lines are available online @xcite .",
    "the wind power production scenarios used for this case study come from @xcite , where the spatio - temporal dependencies of wind power generation are considered .",
    "more specifically , the study in @xcite provides 100 scenarios of wind power production that were generated for 15 control areas and 43 lead times in western denmark .",
    "however , for this work , only 50 equiprobable scenarios and 24 lead times are considered .",
    "we set the mip tolerance gap to @xmath100 in all the simulations pertaining to the ieee 14-node system , while we allow for a mip tolerance gap of up to @xmath101 @xmath102 in those numerical experiments carried out on the ieee 3-area rts-96 system .",
    "we first consider the ieee 14-node system and compare the unit - commitment plans resulting from the proposed huc formulation with those obtained using the method proposed in @xcite , which we refer to as _ zhao model _ hereafter .",
    "the comparison is conducted for a number of partitions in the huc problem ranging from 1 to 10 and a number of values for the weighting factor in zhao model varying from 0 to 1 .",
    "this process prompts two different unit - commitment plans only , namely , ucp1 and ucp2 , whose quality is measured in terms of both the expected and the worst - case system operating cost and indicated in table [ table : zhaopartitions ] .",
    "recall that the pure stochastic and robust unit - commitment solutions are obtained for a number of partitions equal to 10 and 1 in the proposed huc formulation , and for values of the weighting factor in zhao model equal to 0 and 1 , respectively .",

    "the solutions yielded by spda are the same as or even better than the solutions provided by the raw huc .",
    "this is so , because spda ends up solving a smaller version of the raw huc problem ( [ 46])([76 ] ) and , thereby , generally results in unit - commitment solutions with a lower mip gap .",
    "furthermore , spda drastically diminishes the required solution time when the number of partitions is kept low enough , in which case the number of scenarios considered in the last step of the algorithm is small ( see the last two columns of table [ bcwctab2 ] ) . needless to say",
    ", spda reduces to solving the raw huc problem for a number of partitions equal to 50 . note",
    "that the number of binary variables to be treated is independent of the considered solution strategy and equal to 6912 in all cases .",
    "in this paper we propose a new formulation of the unit commitment problem under uncertainty that allows us to find unit - commitment plans that perform relatively well in terms of both the expected and the worst - case system operating cost .",
    "the new formulation relies on clustering the scenario data set into a number of partitions .",
    "the expectation of the system operating cost is then taken over those scenarios that result in the worst - case dispatch cost within each partition . the conservatism of the so - obtained unit - commitment solution ( that is , how close it is to the pure scenario - based stochastic or robust unit - commitment plan ) is controlled via the user - specified number of partitions .",
    "we also develop a parallelization - and - decomposition scheme to efficiently solve the proposed unit - commitment formulation .",
    "our numerical results show that our scheme is able to dramatically reduce the required running time while improving the optimality of the found solution .",
    "we envision two possible avenues of future research at least .",
    "first , we would like to explore the possibility of further using decomposition to solve the reduced version of the proposed unit commitment formulation that is obtained after applying our parallelization - and - decomposition scheme .",
    "second , we would like to investigate how to extend our formulation and the associated solution approach to a multi - stage setup .",
