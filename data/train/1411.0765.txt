    "in light unstable nuclei , various exotic structures such as the magic number breaking , new cluster structures , and the neutron halo structure , have been discovered . in a series of",
    "be isotopes , it has been revealed that the structure changes rapidly with the increase of the neutron number @xmath1 and the cluster structure develops in neutron - rich be isotopes as discussed in many theoretical and experimental studies @xcite .",
    "the cluster structure in the ground states of @xmath3be and @xmath4be is considered to play an important role in the vanishing of the neutron magic number @xmath5 . for @xmath3be ,",
    "the breaking of @xmath5 shell has been known experimentally from the abnormal spin - parity @xmath6 , and for @xmath4be , it has been suggested by slow @xmath7 decay @xcite and more directly evidenced by the intruder configuration observed in 1@xmath8-knockout reactions @xcite as well as other experiments @xcite .",
    "these nuclei have the largely deformed ground states with intruder neutron configurations having more remarkable cluster structure than the neighboring isotope , @xmath9be .    also in neutron - rich b isotopes , the enhancement of cluster structures has been theoretically predicted @xcite , whereas , in neutron - rich c isotopes , no cluster structure is predicted to develop at least in the ground states @xcite .",
    "these facts indicate that the development of cluster structure strongly depends on proton and neutron numbers of the system .",
    "a problem to be solved is how one can experimentally observe the structure change along the isotope chain , i.e. , the enhancement and weakening of the cluster structure with the increase of the neutron number @xmath1 . since the enhanced cluster structure in neutron - rich nuclei enlarges the deformation and spatial extent of proton density , the change of the cluster structure may affect such observables as electric quadrupole moments and charge radii .",
    "the former is not necessarily a direct information of proton structure because it is sensitive not only to the proton distribution but also to the neutron configuration through the angular momentum coupling .",
    "moreover , it gives no information for the @xmath10 ground states of even - even nuclei , in which the quadrupole moment is trivially zero .",
    "the latter , the charge radius , is usually not sensitive to the neutron configuration and it reflects more directly the proton density , at least for the radial extent , and therefore , the @xmath1 dependence of the charge radius can be a probe to clarify the change of the cluster structure .",

    "be isotopes , the large charge radii of @xmath3be and @xmath4be , which have been recently measured , can be understood by the remarkable cluster structure in the deformed ground states of @xmath3be and @xmath4be @xcite . for neutron - rich b and c isotopes ,",

    "recently , a new experimental approach to determine rms radii of point - proton density ( proton radii ) by the charge changing interaction cross section has been proposed and applied to b and c isotopes @xcite .",
    "our aim here is to clarify how the structure change with the @xmath1 increase is reflected in proton radii . for this aim",
    ", we investigate the @xmath1 dependence of proton radii in the isotope chains of be , b , and c and the influence of change of cluster structures and intrinsic deformations on proton radii .",
    "we try to answer the question whether the @xmath1 dependence proton radii can be a probe for the cluster structure in neutron - rich nuclei .    in this study",
    ", we calculate the ground states of be , b , and c isotopes with the method of antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) @xcite .",
    "the method has been proven to be a useful approach to describe structures , in particular , cluster structures , in light neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "systematic studies with the simple version of amd have predicted that structures of be and b isotopes change rapidly with the increase of the neutron number @xcite .",
    "advanced studies with the variation after spin and parity projections ( vap ) in the amd framework have described the breaking of @xmath5 magicity in neutron - rich be @xcite . the latter method ( the amd+vap )",
    "describes better the details of structures in ground and excited states than the former method ( the simple amd ) , in which the variation is performed before the spin projection . in the present study",
    ", we apply the amd+vap to be , b , and c isotopes , and discuss the structure change focusing on the @xmath1 dependence of the proton radius in each series of isotopes .",

    "the paper concludes with a summary in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we describe be , b , and c isotopes with amd wave functions by applying the vap method . for the detailed formulation of the amd+vap , please refer to refs .",
    "the method is basically the same as that used in those previous studies .",
    "a difference in the present calculation from refs .",
    "@xcite is that we do not adopt an artificial barrier potential , which has been used in previous studies to describe highly excited resonance states .",
    "an amd wave function is given by a slater determinant of gaussian wave packets ; @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the antisymmetrizer , and the @xmath14th single - particle wave function is written by a product of spatial(@xmath15 ) , intrinsic spin(@xmath16 ) and isospin(@xmath17 ) wave functions as , @xmath18 @xmath19 and @xmath16 are spatial and spin functions , and @xmath17 is the isospin function fixed to be up ( proton ) or down ( neutron ) .",

    ", @xmath27 is the spin - parity projection operator .    in the present calculation",
    ", we choose the width parameter @xmath28 for single - nucleon gaussian wave packets to minimize energies of stable nuclei ( @xmath29be , @xmath3b , and @xmath4c ) and use the fixed @xmath28 value in each series of isotopes .",
    "the adopted @xmath28 values are @xmath30 @xmath31 for be isotopes , and @xmath32 @xmath31 for b and c isotopes",
    ". the fixing @xmath28 parameter may not be appropriate to describe details of neutron distribution in very neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "however , since our main concern in the present study is systematics of proton distribution , we fix the parameter to remove a possible artifact in proton radii caused by the change of @xmath28 .",
    "if the size of cluster cores in neutron - rich nuclei does not change from that in stable nuclei , the fixing @xmath28 can be a reasonable assumption . for more detailed study , different width parameters for protons and neutrons or independent widths for all nucleons",
    "should be adopted as done in the method of fermionic molecular dynamics ( fmd ) @xcite and an extended version of amd @xcite .    in the amd framework ,",
    "the existence of clusters is not assumed _ a priori _ , but gaussian centroids of all single - nucleon wave packets are independently treated .",
    "nevertheless , if the system favors a specific cluster structure such the structure is automatically obtained by the energy variation because the amd model space contains wave functions for various cluster structures .",
    "we comment here that , in the simple amd used in refs .",

    "the amd+vap , in which the vap is performed for the amd wave function with flexible intrinsic spins , is adopted .",
    "the amd+vap method better describes structures of the ground and excited states of light nuclei and also useful to investigate details of the structure change between shell - model - like states and cluster states than the simple amd .",

    "in contrast , the proton radius in c isotopes shows a weak @xmath1 dependence because of the stability of the proton structure in @xmath2 nuclei . we compared the @xmath1 dependence of the calculated proton radii with that of the experimental radii reduced from the charge radii measured by means of isotope shift and those deduced from the charge changing interaction cross section , and found that the present result is consistent with the existing experimental data .    in the analysis of the structure change and its effect on proton radii in be , b , and c isotopes",
    ", we found that the @xmath1 dependence of proton radii can be a probe to clarify enhancement and weakening of cluster structures . in neutron - rich be and b nuclei ,",
    "the two - center cluster structure is enhanced in the prolately deformed neutron structure .",
    "the @xmath1 dependence of proton radii reflects rather sensitively the cluster structure change , because the central proton density becomes low in consequence of the stretching of the cluster structure .",
    "precise measurements of proton radii for b and c isotopes are required to confirm the cluster structure in neutron - rich b isotopes and the non - cluster structure in c isotopes ..",
