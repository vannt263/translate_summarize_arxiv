    "since the first work on casimir effect performed by casimir @xcite , it has been extensively studied @xcite for more than 60 years .",
    "essentially , the casimir effect is a polarization of the vacuum of some quantized fields , and it may be thought of as the energy due to the distortion of the vacuum .",
    "such a distortion may be caused either by the presence of boundaries in the space - time manifold or by some background field like the gravity .",
    "early works on the gravity effect were performed by utiyama and dewitt , see ref.@xcite@xcite . in history ,",
    "casimir firstly predicts the effect of the boundaries and he found that there is an attractive force acting on two conducting plan - parallel plates in vacuum . since the last decade",
    ", the casimir effect has been paid more attention due to the development of precise measurements @xcite , and it has been applied to the fabrication of microelectromechanical systems ( mems)@xcite . recently ,",
    "some new methods have developed for computing the casimir energy between a finite number of compact objects @xcite .",
    "the nature of the casimir force may depend on ( i ) the background field , ( ii ) the spacetime dimensionality , ( iii ) the type of boundary conditions , ( iv ) the topology of spacetime , ( v ) the finite temperature . the most evident example of the dependence on the geometry is given by the casimir effect inside a rectangular box @xcite .",
    "the detailed calculation of the casimir force inside a d - dimensional rectangular cavity was shown in @xcite , in which the sign of the casimir energy depends on the length of the sides .",
    "the casimir force arises not only in the presence of material boundaries , but also in spaces with nontrivial topology .",
    "for example , we get the scalar field on a flat manifold with topology of a circle @xmath2 .",
    "the topology of @xmath2 causes the periodicity condition @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the circumference of @xmath2 , imposed on the wave function which is of the same kind as those due to boundary .",
    "similarly , the antiperiodic conditions can be drawn on a mbius strip .",
    "the @xmath5-function regularization procedure is a very powerful and elegant technique for the casimir effect .",
    "rigorous extension of the proof of epstein @xmath5-function regularization has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "vacuum polarization in the background of on string was first considered in @xcite .",
    "the generalized @xmath5-function has many interesting applications , e.g. , in the piecewise string @xcite .",
    "similar analysis has been applied to monopoles @xcite , p - branes @xcite or pistons @xcite .",
    "as we have known , there are many things that look like the spring , for instance , dna has the helix structure in our cells .",
    "thus , it is interesting to find the effect of the helix configuration presenting in the space - time manifold for quantum fields and as far as we know , no one has considered this configuration before . in this paper , we have investigated the casimir effect for a massless scalar field on the circular helix structure in two ( 2d ) and three ( 3d ) dimensions by using the zeta function techniques , which is a very useful and elegant technique in regularizing the vacuum energy .    in next section",
    "we have calculated the casimir energy and force by imposing the helix boundary conditions and we find that the behavior of the force parallel to the axis of the helix is very much like the force on a spring that obeys the hooke s law in mechanics when the @xmath6 , which is the ratio of the pitch @xmath7 to the circumference @xmath8 of the helix .",
    "however , in this case , the force comes from a quantum effect , and so we would like to call the helix structure as a _",
    "quantum spring_. when @xmath1 is large , this force behaves like the newton s law of universal gravitation in the leading order and vanishes when @xmath1 goes to the infinity .",
    "the magnitude of this force has a maximum values at @xmath9 ( 2d ) or near @xmath10 ( 3d ) .",
    "on the other hand , the force perpendicular to the axis decreases monotonously with the increasing of the ratio @xmath1 .",
    "both forces are attractive and their behaviors are the same in two and three dimensions",
    ". we will give some discussions and conclusions in the last section .",
    "as mentioned in section [ sec : intro ] , the casimir effect arise not only in the presence of material boundaries , but also in spaces with nontrivial topology .",
    "for example , we get the scalar field on a flat manifold with topology of a circle @xmath2 .",
    "the topology of @xmath2 causes the periodicity condition @xmath3 .",
    "before we consider complicated cases in the flat spacetime , we have to discuss the lattices .",
    "a lattice @xmath11 is defined as a set of points in a flat ( d+1)-dimensional spacetime @xmath12 , of the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a set of basis vectors of @xmath12 . in terms of the components",
    "@xmath15 of vectors @xmath16 , we define the inner products as @xmath17 with @xmath18 for @xmath19 , @xmath20 for otherwise . in the @xmath21 plane ,",
    "the sublattice @xmath22 are @xmath23 and @xmath24    the unit cylinder - cell is the set of points @xmath25 where @xmath26 . when @xmath27 , it contains precisely one lattice point ( i.e. @xmath28 ) , and any vector @xmath29 has precisely one `` image '' in the unit cylinder - cell , obtained by adding a sublattice vector to it .    in this paper",
    ", we choose a topology of the flat ( d+1)-dimensional sapcetime : @xmath30 , see fig.[fig::lattice ] .",
    "this topology causes the helix boundary condition for a hermitian massless scalar field @xmath31 where , if @xmath32 or @xmath33 , it returns to the periodicity boundary condition .    in calculations on the casimir effect",
    ", extensive use is made of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the corresponding field equation . a hermitian massless scalar field @xmath34 defined in a ( d+1)-dimensional flat spacetime satisfies the free klein - gordon equation : @xmath35 where @xmath36 . under the boundary condition ( [ helxi boundary condition ] ) , the modes of the field are then @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a normalization factor and @xmath39 , and we have @xmath40 here , @xmath41 and @xmath42 satisfy @xmath43 in the ground state ( vacuum ) , each of these modes contributes an energy of @xmath44 .",
    "the energy density of the field is thus given by @xmath45 where we have assumed @xmath46 without losing generalities .",
    "the helix boundary condition can be induced by the topology of spacetime.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]      in the @xmath47 dimensional spacetime , we have the following boundary condition to mimic the helix structure : @xmath48 where @xmath7 is regarded as the pitch of the helix , and we call this condition the helix boundary condition .",
    "one can see from eq.([bdc ] ) that it would return to the cylindrical boundary conditions when @xmath7 vanishes and for @xmath49 , the whole system(the spring ) does not have the cylindrical symmetry .",
    "therefore , the vacuum energy density is given by @xmath50 which is divergent , so we should regularize it to get a finite result .",
    "there many regularization method could be used to deal with the divergence , but in this paper we would like to use the zeta function techniques , which is a very useful and elegant technique in regularizing the vacuum energy . to use the @xmath5-function regularization , we define @xmath51 as @xmath52 for @xmath53 to make a finite result provided by the @xmath54 integration , and here we have defined @xmath55 we will see in the following that the analytic continuation to the complex @xmath56 plane is well defined at @xmath57 .",
    "thus , the regularized casimir energy density is @xmath58 . after integrating @xmath54 in eq.([es ] ) , see appendix [ int ] , we get @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the riemann zeta function .",
    "the value of the analytically continued zeta function can be obtained from the reflection relation @xmath61 taking @xmath57 , we get @xmath62 then we have @xmath63 where we have used @xmath64 and if @xmath65 , it come back to the cylindrical case with periodical boundary , see eq.([bdc ] ) .",
    "the casimir force on the @xmath66 direction of the helix is @xmath67 which is always an attractive force and the magnitude of the force monotonously decreases with the increasing of the ratio @xmath1 .",
    "once @xmath1 becomes large enough , the force can be neglected . while , the casimir force on the @xmath68 direction is @xmath69 which has a maximum magnitude at @xmath70 .",
    "when @xmath71 , the magnitude of the force increases with the increasing of @xmath1 until @xmath72 , and the force is almost linearly depending on @xmath1 when @xmath6 .",
    "so , it is just like the force on a spring complying with the hooke s law , but in this case , the force originates from the quantum effect , namely , the casimir effect .",
    "once @xmath73 , the magnitude of the force decreases with the increasing of @xmath1 . to illustrate the behavior of the casimir force in this case , we plot them for each direction in fig.[fig::force2d ] .    the casimir force on the @xmath66 ( left ) and @xmath68 ( right ) direction in the unit @xmath74 _ vs. _ the ratio @xmath1 in @xmath47 dimension .",
    "the point corresponds to the maximum magnitude of the force at @xmath72.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ] the casimir force on the @xmath66 ( left ) and @xmath68 ( right ) direction in the unit @xmath74 _ vs. _ the ratio @xmath1 in @xmath47 dimension .",
    "the point corresponds to the maximum magnitude of the force at @xmath72.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]    it should be noticed that in fig.[fig::force2d ] , the behavior of the forces are different with respect to the ratio @xmath1 , but this dose not conflict with the relation ( [ energy ] ) , which shows that labeling the axes is a matter of convention , namely the final result should have the the symmetry of @xmath75 .",
    "the reason is the following , eq.([r e ] ) could be rewritten in terms of @xmath8 and @xmath7 : @xmath76 which respects the symmetry of @xmath75 in deed . and",
    ", one can easily see that eqs .",
    "( [ force1 a ] ) and ( [ force1 h ] ) are also under this symmetry , if one rewritten these equations as @xmath77 which are all consistent with the relation ( [ energy ] ) .      as in the @xmath47 dimension case ,",
    "the vacuum energy density in @xmath78 dimention is given by @xmath79 where @xmath80 .",
    "again , to use the @xmath5-function regularization , we define @xmath51 as @xmath81 and for @xmath53 , and we have defined @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath1 is still the ratio of @xmath7 to @xmath8 defined in eq.([gamma ] ) .",
    "we will see in the following that the analytic continuation to the complex @xmath56 plane is also well defined at @xmath57 in this case .",
    "thus , the regularized casimir energy density is @xmath58 . after integrating @xmath54 and @xmath84 in eq.([es 31 ] ) , see appendix [ inte ] , we get @xmath85 taking @xmath57 , we get @xmath86 from ( [ rel ] ) , and then @xmath87 therefore , the casimir force on the @xmath66 direction of the helix is @xmath88 \\,,\\\\&&\\label{force a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is always attractive and its magnitude monotonously decreases with the increasing of the ratio @xmath1 . by the definition of the hypergeometric function ,",

    "then , it is clear to see that , the force will be vanished when @xmath1 goes to infinity . on the other hand ,",

    ". when @xmath1 is large , the force behaves like the newton s law of universal gravitation , i.e. @xmath98 in the leading order .",
    "furthermore , there exists a maximum magnitude of the force @xmath99 when @xmath1 takes a critical value @xmath100 , which satisfy the following equation @xmath101 to illustrate the behavior of the forces on the helix , we plot them for each direction in fig.[fig::force3d ] .",

    "in conclusion , we have investigated the casimir effect with a helix configuration in two and three dimensions , and it can be easily generalized to high dimensions .",
    "we find that the force parallel to the axis of the helix has a particular behaviors that the casimir force in the usual case do no possesses .",

    "furthermore , the the magnitude of this force has a maximum values at @xmath9 ( 2d ) or near @xmath10 ( 3d ) .",
    "so , we would like to call this helix configuration as a _ quantum spring _ , see fig.[fig::spring ] .",
    "on the other hand , the force perpendicular to the axis decreases monotonously with the increasing of the ratio @xmath1 .",
    "both forces are attractive and their behaviors are the same in two and three dimensions .    it should be noticed that , the critical value @xmath104 , at witch the magnitude of the force gets its maximum value depends on the space - time dimensions . on a general @xmath105-dimensional ( @xmath106 ) flat space - time manifold , the casimir energy density on the helix",
    "is roughly given by @xmath107 up to some coefficient .",
    "then , the casimir force on the @xmath68 direction is roughly @xmath108 thus the critical value @xmath104 satisfies @xmath109 which can not be exactly solved but one can numerically calculate the critical point @xmath104 . in fig.[fig::rd ] , we have shown the dependence of @xmath104 on the space dimension @xmath110 from two to ten dimensions .    the critical value @xmath104 _",
    "vs_. the space dimension @xmath110.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in this paper , we have considered the massless scalar field , and one can easily generalize it to a massive scalar field . as is known that the casimir effect disappears as the mass of the field goes to infinity since there are no more quantum fluctuation in this limit , but of course , how the casimir force varies as the mass changes is worth studying @xcite , and we will study it in our further work @xcite , in which we will also consider the casimir effect of the electromagnetic field in the helix configuration . since this _ quantum spring _",
    "effect may be detected in the laboratory and be applied to the microelectromechanical system , we suggest to do the experiment to verify our results . it should be noticed that , in the experiment or the real application , the spring like fig.[fig::spring ] should be soft , which means the force coming from the classical mechanics could be small enough , and the quantum effect dominates the behavior of the spring .",
