    ", the application of the bdg formalism is mostly limited to the zero - temperature properties of single - vortex states @xcite . to circumvent this limitation",
    "there has been a great interest in the development of effective field theories ( eft ) which describe a superfluid system in terms of a macroscopic wave function ( order parameter ) .",
    "the common key approximation for all branches of the eft is the gradient expansion of the pair field , assuming it to be slowly varying in time and space .",

    "the gradient expansion is a common intrinsic element of an eft",
    ". therefore all advantages and shortcomings of this approach are not specific to the present work but are common for all efts ( including gl and gp ) .",
    "our derivation of the basic expressions of the finite temperature eft @xcite is based on a straightforward extension of the first - nonvanishing - order expansion of the pair field action in powers of the pair field @xmath1 by a complete exact summation of the series in powers of @xmath1 .",

    "@xcite ) .    in order to clearly indicate the place of the present work in the scientific context , we stress that extensions the bdg and gorkov theories which embrace bcs to bec regimes for cold quantum gases were developed before in many works starting from the nozires and schmitt - rink ( nsr ) scheme , see , e. g. , refs .",

    "a complementary approach for fermi gases in the bcs - bec crossover is based on the bcs - leggett ground state @xcite .",
    "the main difference between these two methods is that the nsr - based scheme reaches the bcs - bec crossover by starting from the bec limit , and the bcs - leggett based scheme reaches this crossover by starting from the bcs limit ( for a detailed comparison , see ref .",
    "our recent works @xcite lie within the context of the former .",
    "the new elements of our version of the eft , and , particularly , the message of the present paper can be described as follows .",
    "the gl approach with microscopically derived coefficients uses the pair field as a small parameter .",
    "therefore it is valid only near @xmath0 . on one hand ,",
    "the extension of the gl approach for quantum gases valid near @xmath0 in the whole bcs - bec crossover and at @xmath2 in the bec limit was developed in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "an all - temperature extension of the gl method for bcs superconductors was developed by tewordt and werthammer @xcite using the gradient expansion for the order parameter .",
    "our recent treatment @xcite partly fills an existing gap , finding a similar extension of the gl method for quantum gases in the bcs - bec crossover .    finally , the specific message of the present paper is an incorporation of rotation into the effective field theory of refs @xcite .",
    "this is done in sec .",
    "[ sec : eft ] by including the rotating potential at the level of the fermionic degrees of freedom , and deriving the modified eft for the macroscopic wave function .",
    "as we will show , the vector potential of rotation contains the renormalization factor for the pair mass , which is in agreement with results of the functional renormalization group theory @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we show the equilibrium vortex state diagrams and determine the critical rotation frequencies as a function of temperature and interaction strength , compare the results with those of refs . @xcite and analyze their connection with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "our results are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in the present work , we consider a rotating fermi gas confined to an anisotropic parabolic trap described by the confinement frequencies @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) within the ktd approach described in refs .",
    "@xcite and based on the path - integral description of the interacting fermi gas .",
    "the hubbard - stratonovich transformation is used to introduce the bosonic pair field @xmath1 , and the action functional for these fields is obtained by integrating out the fermionic degrees of freedom . in the resulting action , a gradient expansion is performed , not around @xmath5 as in the ginzburg - landau approach , but around the coordinate - dependent saddle - point value to be determined self consistently . the bosonic pair field",
    "is then interpreted as a macroscopic wave function for the superfluid pair condensate .",
    "the regimes of validity of this method have been studied in detail in ref .",
    "it is relevant to discuss once more the criteria of validity of the eft in the present work .",
    "a necessary condition for the validity of this approach is the same as that for known effective field methods , e.  g. , the ginzburg - landau and gross - pitaevskii formalisms : the bosonic field @xmath1 must vary sufficiently slowly in space and in time .",
    "this condition is consistent with a large number of particles in the superfluid system .",
    "therefore we restrict the treatment to fermi gases with a sufficiently large number of particles or sufficiently strong coupling in order to ensure @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the characteristic scale for the trap potential along the @xmath9-th axis , @xmath10 is the size of the superfluid cloud along the same axis , and @xmath11 is the characteristic scale of non - uniform excitations .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 can then be interpreted as the healing length for these excitations , e. g. , vortices or solitons .    in order to determine the range of applicability of the eft , other length scales",
    "must also be taken into account , such as the particle spacing , the scattering length , and the pair size .",
    "two of them are crucial for the criterion of applicability for effective field approaches : the healing length and the pair size .",
    "the latter one can be estimated through the pair coherence length @xmath12 which was determined in @xcite through the pair correlation function of the fermion field operators @xmath13,@xmath14 using the definition @xmath15    effective field approaches are applicable when the pair size is small with respect to the size of a non - uniform solution itself , i. e. , when @xmath16 ( see also the similar discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . as found in ref .",
    "@xcite , the domain of applicability of the ktd effective field theory is extended with respect to the gl approach ( valid at @xmath17 close to @xmath0 ) towards low temperatures , and with respect to the gp approach ( valid in the bec limit ) towards bcs .",
    "the ktd effective field theory is thus not valid in the bcs regime combined with low temperatures @xmath18 .    in order to incorporate rotation into the ktd approach , we first consider the single - particle hamiltonian for a fermionic atom with mass @xmath19 confined to an anisotropic parabolic trap in the rotating frame of reference .",
    "the rotation leads to the appearance of the term @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the rotation frequency and @xmath22 is the @xmath23 component of the orbital angular momentum of the particle .",
    "therefore the single - particle hamiltonian in the rotating frame of reference is @xcite:@xmath24 with the rotational  vector potential _ for fermions_,@xmath25   , \\label{vecpot}\\ ] ] and the rotation vector @xmath26 the effect of rotation in this hamiltonian is explicitly subdivided to the coriolis and centrifugal contributions . the coriolis contribution results in the appearance of the vector potential ( [ vecpot ] ) , for which @xmath27 .",
    "the centrifugal potential leads to the softening of the confinement potential through @xmath28 .",
    "the trapped atomic configuration can be stable when @xmath29 . in the context of our earlier assumption of a slowly varying field ,",
    "the local density approximation is suitable to take into account the confinement for a rotating fermi gas through a coordinate dependent chemical potential:@xmath30 this chemical potential enters the coordinate - dependent fermion density , which is determined from the local number equation .",
    "note that a parabolic confinement potential facilitates the applicability of the effective field theory and of the local density approximation with respect to a confinement with sharp edges , e.  g. , a box potential .",
    "moreover , faster rotation makes the confinement potential smoother , so that the rotation does not break up the applicability of the present method .",
    "the local density approximation for centrifugal and coriolis contributions has , in general , the same range of applicability as described above .    within the present treatment , both the superfluid and normal components of the fermi gas",
    "are assumed to be in equilibrium in the rotating frame of reference .",
    "this approximation is used in many works , see , e.  g. , refs . @xcite and references therein .",
    "recently , it was argued that rotation may cause a phase separation between a nonrotating superfluid core and a rigidly rotating normal gas @xcite .",
    "also the cylindric rotation symmetry about the @xmath23 axis is broken in experiments due to a stirring field , which provides the rotation .",
    "the study of these effects is however beyond the scope of the present work .    within the path - integral formalism of preceding works @xcite and following to the scheme developed in refs .",

    "the linear term in the gradient expansion appears due to rotation , because rotation breaks the local inversion symmetry .",
    "note that this linear term is derived in a straightforward way , without any ad hoc assumption beyond the effective field approach .",
    "it can be shown that the present approach is in agreement with well - established results of the functional renormalization group theory @xcite in what concerns the effective pair mass . in the microscopic theory of superconductivity @xcite ,",
    "the pair charge was determined as @xmath48 . as proven by alben @xcite",
    ", the rotation of a superconductor brings a contribution to the vector potential with the same charge / mass ratio for a pair as for a free electron . therefore the total vector potential of in the gl equation is twice the vector potential for an electron , both for rotating and non - rotating superconductors . in theories of rotating fermi gases based on the gl or bdg equations @xcite , this principle is kept .",
    "contrary to the gl or bdg based descriptions , effective field theories developed within the nsr - like formalism @xcite and within the renormalization group theory @xcite necessarily contain the renormalized pair effective mass @xmath49 , which tends to @xmath50 only in the extreme bec case .",

    "thus , besides a renormalization of the chemical potential , an important element of the bcs - bec crossover in the present work is a renormalization of all coefficients of the effective field action , including the renormalization of the pair mass .",

    "this appearance of different critical rotation frequencies is apparently related to the fact that the lpda equation determines a dynamic stability of vortices . in the eft",

    "this agreement is remarkable despite the fact that the rotation is incorporated in the lpda equation of ref .",
    "@xcite and in the present work in different ways .",
    "in the present work , we extend the effective field theory developed in refs . @xcite for fermionic superfluids to the case of rotating fermi gases .",
    "the treatment is performed within the same path integral formalism as in the theoretical studies of cold quantum gases which embrace bcs to bec regimes , performed in preceding works .",
    "the new physics in our recent works on the eft is related to an extension of the gl theory below @xmath0 in the bcs - bec crossover .",
    "the rotation has been incorporated in the effective field action in a straightforward way , leading to the appearance of an effective vector potential as in other effective field theories .",
    "therefore the physical picture , e. g. , for the formation of vortices , is qualitatively one and the same in different formalisms ( see , e. g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the new results consist in a concrete form of the coefficients of the eft action , which are not phenomenological , but they are derived microscopically , starting from the initial fermionic hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , when describing the formation of vortices , the novelty consists in a quantitative description of the vortex system in a rotating trap .",
    "one of the non - trivial physical results obtained in the present work is the fact that the vector potential of the rotation in the effective field action can be different from twice the vector potential for bare fermions .",
    "this difference is due to a renormalization of the effective mass for the pair field .",
    "it is directly related to the fact that the description of an interacting quantum atomic fermi gas differs from the known bcs formalism for superconductors even in the bcs regime , that has been pointed out already in ref .",

    ", the rotation leads to a shift in the local chemical potential @xmath137 , and to the appearance of the rotational vector potential @xmath138 in the covariant derivative @xmath139 , that leads to the renormalization factor  @xmath51 in the equations of motion for the pair field .",
    "the renormalization factor tends to two in the bec  limit , in agreement with the physical picture of a molecular bose gas with the boson mass @xmath58 . moving away from the bec limit",
    ", this value diminishes .",
    "the change of the renormalization factor from the bec limiting value @xmath140 has a clear physical explanation .",
    "the fermion pair in a rotating fermi condensate moves similarly to a point particle only in the deep bec regime .",
    "however , beyond the bec limit , the fermion pair can not be considered as a point particle , especially in the bcs regime , where the cooper - pair size is large . as a result ,",
    "the pair effective mass diminishes when the inverse scattering length moves from bec to the bcs side .",
    "the renormalization of the effective mass that we obtain is in agreement with the preceding effective field theory of atomic fermi gases , as checked by the comparison of the derived effective field action in particular cases @xmath141 and @xmath142 with reliable works @xcite .",
    "it is also in agreement with results of the functional renormalization group theory @xcite .    using the obtained formalism , we investigate equilibrium vortex state diagrams where we identify regions for the superfluid state with no vortices , one vortex and two or more vortices . for the equilibrium vortex state diagrams in the variables @xmath143",
    ", the transition curves between these regions bend over in the bcs regime , in agreement with the results found using bdg calculations in this regime @xcite . as the number of particles",
    "is increased , the region of the equilibrium vortex state diagram where vortices are stable extends deeper into the bcs regime .",
    "increasing the temperature , on the other hand , shrinks the region of stable vortices .",
    "the obtained dependence of the renormalization factor on the inverse scattering length is essential for these equilibrium vortex state diagrams , especially for sufficiently weak couplings .",
    "the range of applicability of any kind of the effective field theory ( including , e. g. , gl and gp methods ) is intrinsically related to the common assumption for them  that the order parameter smoothly varies in time and space . in what concerns the space variation",
    ", this means that the eft can be applicable when the characteristic scale of the variation of the order parameter ( e. g. , the size of vortices or solitons ) exceeds the cooper - pair correlation length , as discussed in ref .",
    "the range of applicability of the present finite temperature eft has been estimated quantitatively in ref .",
    "the rotation considered in the present work does not crucially influence the range of applicability of the eft .",
    "the equilibrium vortex state diagrams in the variables @xmath144 exhibit clear similarity with the results of the bdg method ( both the complete bdg @xcite and the coarse graining approximation for bdg @xcite ) where a good quantitative agreement has been found between the critical rotation frequencies obtained within the present theory and coarse - grained bdg .",
    "the lowest critical frequencies calculated in both eft and lpda approaches lie very close to each other despite the fact that our calculation lies within the nsr - like picture ( where the effective mass of dressed  pairs is renormalized ) while the lpda treatment is in agreement with the bcs - leggett picture , where masses of pairs are non - renormalized .",
    "this coincidence is remarkable and may be useful to throw a bridge between these two paradigms .",
    "we have also arrived at the optimal inverse scattering length for the vortex formation corresponding to the lowest critical rotation frequency .",
    "this value of the inverse scattering length is in a good agreement with the coupling strength at which the maximal number of vortices is generated in the experiment @xcite .    in the present work , we considered the equilibrium configurations of vortices in rotating traps .",
    "the time - dependent phenomena can also be investigated within the eft , in general combined with equations for the quasiparticle distributions .",
    "these equations are not an intrinsic part of the eft and can be added as an independent ingredient .",
    "we have however treated some particular time - dependent phenomena ( travelling dark solitons and collective excitations in quantum fermi gases ) in refs .",
    "@xcite , and the ktd effective field approach appears to be in line with the bdg theory and with experiments .",
    "it is worth noting that an advantage of the present method with respect to the bdg theory is much shorter computational time and lower memory consumption .",
    "this advantage persists even with respect to the coarse - grained bdg , because the minimization of the free energy is substantially simpler and faster than a numerical solution of the differential equations .",
    "moreover , effective field approaches allow for analytic solutions in many interesting cases , as shown in our work on dark solitons @xcite .",
    "therefore it is planned to extend the treatment of non - linear excitations in condensed fermi gases within the eft , involving other factors of interest , such as spin imbalance , two - band fermi gases , and spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the spin imbalance has been already incorporated analytically in the coefficients of the effective action ( [ seft ] ) , and the analysis of effects provided by the imbalance combined with the rotation is in progress .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling will be taken to account at the microscopic level similarly to refs .",
    "@xcite . finally , as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : eft ] , the extension of the present approach to two - band fermi gases is straightforward .    the other ingredient which can be incorporated in the eft is the account of induced interactions first considered by gorkov and melik - barkhudarov @xcite .",

    "the induced interactions lead to substantial corrections of the parameters of state in the bcs regime , while being less significant in the bec regime .",

    "this physical picture assumes that the cooper pair size is small with respect to a characteristic size of the superfluid system ( for example , the radius of the trap ) so that the background parameters within the extent of a cooper pair are approximately uniform .",
