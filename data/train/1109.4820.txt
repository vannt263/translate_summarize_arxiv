    "the most important effect that has to be considered is the bias , introduced and discussed in detail in @xcite , that stems from the a posteriori definition of the redshift interval for which the likelihood of a cluster is calculated .",
    "when the redshift interval is defined a posteriori ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) , one ignores the fact that the potentially rare cluster of interest could have easily appeared at a different redshift leading to a different probability of existence . in order to avoid this bias we decided to define a priori four redshift bins @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 and to calculate the probability distributions of the most massive cluster in these intervals for a given survey area , @xmath120 , as illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : scheme ] .",
    "then , we select , out of the clusters listed in section  [ sec : gevclust ] , the most massive ones that fall in these individual bins and quantify their probability of existence .",
    "the effect of the bias is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spt ] as a substantial shift of the probability distributions depending on the choice of the redshift interval and is discussed in more detail below in section  [ subsec : high_z ] .",
    "another obstacle to be overcome is the unification of the mass definitions .",
    "all observed masses @xmath121 stated above , apart from act - cl  j0102 and spt - cl  j2106 , are defined with respect to the _ critical _ background density @xmath122 , whereas for the theoretical mass function the _ mean _ background density is assumed @xmath123 . in order to compare the two , we have to scale the cluster masses to the definition used in the mass function . for an arbitrary overdensity , @xmath124 ,",

    "one can write @xmath133 where @xmath128 and @xmath134 are related through the assumed nfw mass density profile by @xmath135 together with the @xmath136-@xmath137 relation of @xcite , which we adopted for this work , one can directly scale from @xmath49 to @xmath51 .",
    "for the selected clusters the results are given in the third column of tab .",
    "[ tab : clusters ] .",
    "+ since the mass function is very steep at the high mass end , it is more likely that lower mass systems scatter up than higher mass systems scatter down , resulting in a systematic shift .",
    "this effect is known as eddington bias @xcite and has to be corrected for when observed masses have to be related to the distribution functions of the most massive halo .",
    "this is done , following @xcite , by shifting the observed mass , @xmath138 , to a corrected mass , @xmath139 , by @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the local slope of the mass function ( @xmath142 ) and @xmath52 is the uncertainty in the mass measurement . for the systems listed above we inferred @xmath52 from the reported observational limits on the mass and rounded them up , just to be on the conservative side .",
    "the adopted values for @xmath52 are listed together with the eddington bias corrected masses in tab .  [",
    "tab : clusters ] for all eight studied clusters .",
    "the variations in @xmath52 stem from the fact that some masses were estimated by the combination of different probes , like lensing+sz+x - ray , whereas some others are based only on a single probe . +",
    "the two corrections , the change of mass definition and the eddington bias , work in opposite directions , because the former increases the cluster mass and the latter lowers it .",

    "it is crucial to take both effects into account or the drawn conclusions might be wrong .",
    "after having introduced all the effects that have to be taken into account for a sound statistical analysis of the existence probability of single very massive clusters , we now apply gev to the four most massive clusters in the four redshift intervals summarised in tab .",

    "[ fig : spt ] how , in the biased case , the clusters move towards the tail of the distribution and appear therefore less likely to be found . depending on at what redshift the cluster of interest resides at in the redshift bin , the effect of the bias is more or less pronounced , as can be seen by comparing the pdf of a2163 with the ones of act - cl  j0102 or spt - cl  j2106 .",
    "the bias is substantial in the sense that the existence probabilities increase and the allowed range due to the mass error widens , as is illustrated by the red and grey areas shown in the right - hand panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : spt ] for the cdfs .",
    "the reason for the big difference in the allowed probability region is the steepness of the cdf of the most massive cluster in the given survey volume . + for the probability to find the most massive cluster in a given bin to be more massive than the observed one , we obtain the following results : @xmath149 per cent for a2163 in bin @xmath150 , @xmath151 per cent for act - cl  j0102 in bin @xmath152 , @xmath153 per cent for spt - cl  j2106 in bin @xmath154 and @xmath155 per cent for xxmu  j0044 in bin @xmath156 . the allowed range in the existence probability due to the uncertainty in the cluster mass determination is listed in the rightmost column of tab .",

    "+ if a2163 , a370 and rxj1347 had been observed in a _",
    "spt_-like field ( triangle ) instead of the one ( square ) , the resulting biased probabilities of their existence would be similar to the high-@xmath9 ones ( especially when taking into consideration that larger @xmath52 values lead to smaller eddington bias corrected masses for the low-@xmath9 systems ) . and",
    ", vice versa , an increase of the survey area for the high-@xmath9 systems would alleviate their low probabilities of existence , unless more extreme objects are found in the future . + by looking to currently known very massive single objects at low and high redshifts and analysing their cdfs as function of area , one does not find any evidence for trend with redshift that high-@xmath9 systems are more extreme than low-@xmath9 systems .",
    "therefore there is no indication for deviations from the @xmath8cdm expectations so far .",
    "of course , when drawing conclusions from this fact , one has to be careful , since at high-@xmath9 the sufficiently deep covered survey area is only a fraction of the low redshift one .",
    "furthermore , cluster mass estimates , particularly at high redshifts , are delicate and possible biases at high-@xmath9 are not yet fully explored . as a verdict it is certainly interesting to confront the most massive clusters at different redshifts with the expectations from theory once a sufficiently deep full - sky cluster survey will be available .",
    "all the probability ranges stated in the previous section are very closely related to the statistical concept of quantiles .",
    "the extreme quantile function based on gev is the inverse of the cdf from equation and is found to be given by @xmath171^{-\\gamma}\\rbrace , & \\quad { \\rm for}\\quad\\gamma\\neq 0,\\\\      \\alpha-\\beta\\ln\\left[-\\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{100}\\right)\\right ] , & \\quad { \\rm for}\\quad\\gamma = 0,\\\\    \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] a quantile @xmath172 is the value of the random variable for which the probability @xmath173 is @xmath174 or , in our case of interest , it is the mass of a cluster such that , in @xmath174 percent of the observed patches , the most massive cluster has a smaller mass than the @xmath174-quantile mass .",
    "usually @xmath172 is also referred to as _ return level _ and it is connected to the _ return period _ @xmath175 . + for the case studied here , it is interesting to compute the lines for the four a priori defined redshift intervals ( see tab .",
    "[ tab : bins ] ) in the plane spanned by mass and survey area that would correspond to a given fixed quantile @xmath174 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : contours ] for @xmath176 ( left - hand panel ) , @xmath177 ( central panel ) and for @xmath178 ( right - hand panel ) , where the red , dash - dotted lines denote from top to bottom the survey areas of the _ rass _ , _ spt _ and _ xdcp _ surveys .",
    "it can be seen that the contours for fixed redshift bins and quantile @xmath174 exhibit a steep increase with mass and they also reflect the fact that , in high-@xmath9 bins , smaller masses are needed to reach a given quantile . + the contour plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : contours ] confirm the results from section  [ subsec : high_z ] in which we found that none of the very massive known clusters , neither at high nor at low redshifts , is in tension with @xmath8cdm . if we define the @xmath178 quantile as the line where the @xmath8cdm model is excluded and we assume a _",
    "rass_-like cluster survey , then one would need to find a cluster of @xmath179 at @xmath180 . for the third redshift bin of @xmath118",
    ", one would require a mass of @xmath181 , which is roughly the double of the mass of spt - cl  j2106 .",
    "for the lowest redshift bins of @xmath117 and @xmath182 , we find @xmath183 and @xmath184 , respectively . the existence of the latter can already nowadays be excluded on the basis of _ rass _ and _ macs _",
    "@xcite surveys and for redshifts below @xmath185 _ planck _",
    "@xcite should be capable of delivering a definite answer .",
    "for the high redshift end with @xmath10 , future missions like _",
    "euclid _ @xcite and _ erosita _",
    "@xcite should definitely be able to detect such extreme systems if they exist .",
    "+ the lesson to be learnt from the exercise above is that gev could offer a quick way for characterising the statistical expectations for very massive high-@xmath9 clusters .",
    "but for cosmological model testing , a proper knowledge of the survey area is crucial . of course",
    ", it is not only the area but also the depth that matters because other surveys covering the same object should ideally be as deep as the original survey to be matchable , which usually is a particular problem for the very high-@xmath9 clusters .",
    "furthermore , even if one finds a high quantile cluster , let s assume @xmath186 in a small survey area , one should keep in mind that , when sampling a gev distribution , such systems have to exist if the sample is big enough . considering the current high-@xmath9 coverage",
    "this is all that can currently be done , but with future full - sky surveys it might be interesting to try to measure the cdf itself as proposed in @xcite .",
    "in this work we presented the application of general extreme value statistics on very massive single clusters at high and low redshifts . after introducing the formalism , we applied these statistics to eight very massive clusters at high and low redshifts . on the high redshift side ,",
    "those clusters comprise the _ act _ detected cluster act - cl  j0102 - 4915 , the _ spt _ cluster spt - cl  j2106 - 5844 and two clusters found by the _ xmm - newton _ distant cluster project ( _ xdcp _ ) survey : xmmu  j2235.32557 and xmmu  j0044.0 - 2033 .",
    "for the low redshift systems , we considered a2163 , a370 , rxj1347 - 1145 and 1e0657 where the latter was added to the study because it is the most massive cluster in the _ spt _ survey .",
    "+ by computing the cdfs and pdfs for the individual survey set - ups as well as fictitious survey areas , we relate the individual systems with the probability to find them as most massive system for a given size of the survey area . in order to avoid the bias arising from the posterior choice of the redshift interval ,",
    "as discussed in @xcite , we define the redshift intervals prior to the analysis to be : @xmath182 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 . from the aforementioned eight clusters , we chose the respective most massive one in each individual bin and calculate its existence probability in a @xmath8cdm cosmology .",
    "+ we find that , in the lowest redshift bin of @xmath182 and the _ rass _ survey area of @xmath187 , a2163 has an existence probability of @xmath188 per cent in a range of @xmath189 per cent reflecting the uncertainty in the mass determination . in the second redshift interval of @xmath117 ,",
    "act - cl  j0102 has , in the combined survey area of _ act _ and _ spt _ of @xmath94 , an existence probability of @xmath190 per cent in a range of @xmath191 per cent . for spt - cl  j2106 - 5844",
    ", we find @xmath192 per cent in a range of @xmath193 per cent in the interval of @xmath118 and the _ spt _ survey area of @xmath95 . in the highest redshift bin of @xmath119",
    ", we find for xmmu  j0044.0 - 2033 in the @xmath194 _ xdcp _ survey area a probability of @xmath195 per cent in a range of @xmath196 per cent .",
    "this result , by classifying this system as not in tension with @xmath8cdm at all , differs significantly from the results of @xcite who claim this system to be in extreme tension with @xmath8cdm even if the full - sky is assumed as survey area .",
    "therefore , none of the clusters can be considered to be in tension with @xmath8cdm even if the upper allowed observed mass is assumed .",
    "+ if we neglect the aforementioned bias arising from the posterior choice of the redshift interval , as it has been done in most of the literature in the past years ( apart from @xcite and @xcite ) , and fix the redshift interval a posteriori , we find for spt - cl  j2106 - 5844 a probability of @xmath168 per cent .",
    "this result is in good agreement with the findings of @xcite , who report a probability of @xmath169 per cent based on a full likelihood analysis .",
    "the agreement of the two results advocates gev as a quick tool for analysing the probability of observed high - mass clusters before a full likelihood analysis is performed .",
    "+ by confronting the results of our survey area based gev analysis for both , low and high redshift clusters , we do not find any indication for a trend in redshift in the sense that high-@xmath9 systems are more extreme than low-@xmath9 ones . by studying the cdfs of the observed clusters as a function of the survey area ,",
    "we show that the most likely explanation for the lower existence probabilities of current high mass , high-@xmath9 clusters with respect to low-@xmath9 ones , is the lack of sufficiently deep and large high-@xmath9 surveys .",
    "thus , based on current data , we do not see any tendency for a deviation from @xmath8cdm for the most massive clusters as a function of redshift . of course",
    ", one should also be aware that , apart from the fact that the current observational data are not deep and complete enough , also possible biases can be present in the cluster mass estimates , particularly at high redshifts . + in addition , we introduced the extreme quantiles and calculated the contours corresponding to a fixed @xmath174-quantile for a fixed redshift interval in the plane spanned by cluster mass and survey area .",
    "these contours allow one to infer what mass a cluster would need to have in order to cause a substantial tension with @xmath8cdm .",
    "we find that a cluster with an existence probability of @xmath197 would have to have at least a mass of @xmath183 in @xmath117 , @xmath181 in @xmath118 and @xmath179 for @xmath180 .",
    "the first two correspond to twice the mass of the most massive currently known cluster in these redshift intervals and the last one corresponds to a cluster similar to spt - cl  j2106 at @xmath180 .",
    "these very high masses make more and more questionable the possibility to find a single cluster with the potential to significantly question @xmath8cdm .",
    "however , ongoing and future large area surveys like _ planck _ , _ erosita _ and _ euclid _ have the capabilities to give a definite answer to this question . + thus , the main conclusions that can be drawn from this work can be summarised as follows :    1 .",
    "none of the currently known very massive clusters at high and low redshifts exhibits tension with @xmath8cdm .",
    "2 .   there is no indication for very high-@xmath9 clusters being more extreme than low-@xmath9 ones and therefore no indication of deviations from the @xmath8cdm structure growth or of strong redshift depended biases in the cluster mass estimates .",
    "clusters with the potential to significantly question @xmath8cdm would require substantially higher masses in the different redshift regimes than currently known . 4 .",
    "gev is a valuable tool to understand the rareness of massive galaxy clusters and delivers comparable results to more costly full likelihood analyses .    as a closing word of warning",
    ", one should be cautious when trying to reject a distribution function and thus a underlying cosmological model by means of a single observed object .",
    "very rare realisations of a random variable do have to exist and by observing just one there is no telling whether it stems from the tail of the assumed pdf or from the peak of another one . for small patches",
    ", one may solve this dilemma by observing many of those and directly reconstruct the underlying cdf @xcite ; for large patches , however , one is limited by cosmic variance .",
