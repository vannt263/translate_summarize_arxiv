    "during the last decade , compelling evidence has shown that the introduction of an array of micro - holes ( antidots ) in a superconducting film has a profound influence on both the critical current@xcite   and the critical temperature@xcite .",
    "typically , at temperatures used for transport measurements , the antidots are able to trap only one flux quantum @xmath2 before saturation sets in . in this case , after the first matching field @xmath3 , interstitial vortices appear in the sample , creating a  composite vortex lattice \" , where part of the vortices is strongly pinned at the antidots and the rest occupies interstitial positions in between the antidots.@xcite due to their higher mobility , the presence of interstitial vortices lowers the critical current   significantly and broadens the   transition .    in this work ,",
    "we study a _",
    "composite antidot array _ , consisting of two interpenetrating square lattices with the same period @xmath4 m , but different antidot size ( @xmath5@xmath6 m and @xmath7 m ) .",
    "the two sublattices are shifted with respect to each other by half a unit cell along @xmath8- and @xmath9-directions , so that the small antidot is placed in the center of the unit cell of the lattice of large antidots ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : chc_layout ] ) .",
    "this arrangement of antidots corresponds to the vortex lattice configuration at the second matching field in a sample with a single square array of antidots with @xmath10 .",
    "the purpose of this experiment is to enlarge the field range where an enhanced critical current   is observed , by having efficient pinning sites exactly at the locations where the interstitial vortices would appear if the smaller antidots were not present .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present some details concerning the sample preparation and characterization . in section [ composite_tch ]",
    "we study the phase boundary @xmath0 which allows us to identify the different vortex configurations .",
    "section [ section : chc_ich ] is devoted to the flux pinning properties of this composite array of holes by measuring the critical current as a function of field and temperature .",
    "we show that a composite antidot lattice considerably increases the critical current at high fields .",
    "this effect results from the fact that for @xmath11 the saturated small holes force the incoming vortices to occupy the big antidots .",
    "this situation persists until @xmath12 where the big antidots saturate and interstitial vortices form a more complex pattern .",
    "finally , in section [ patterns ] we determine the most stable vortex patterns by means of molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "the used sample is a 50 nm - thick pb film with a composite antidot lattice .",
    "the results obtained with this sample are directly contrasted with those measured on a reference antidot sample without the small holes , i.e. @xmath13 m and @xmath14 m . in both cases , the bridge made for transport measurements ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : chc_layout](a ) ) has a width of 300  @xmath6 m and a voltage contact separation of 2  mm .",
    "the unit cell of the composite antidot array is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : chc_layout](b ) .",
    "the procedures followed to grow the samples are described in ref .",
    "the transport measurements were carried out in a commercial ppms - quantum design device with a temperature stability better than 0.5 mk .",
    "all measurements were performed with the field @xmath15 applied perpendicular to the surface of the film .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath16  k was determined from the resistive transition   in zero field , using a criterion of 10% of the normal state resistance @xmath17 .    due to the lateral nanostructuring",
    ", the effective width of the sample is reduced from 300  @xmath6 m to 140  @xmath6 m . here , we have assumed that we can model the antidot sample as a set of 200 parallel strips of width 0.7  @xmath6m@xmath18 m ) .",
    "this effective width was employed to calculate the resistivity @xmath19(7.5",
    "k)@xmath20 m from the resistance @xmath21(7.5",
    "k)@xmath22 . using the listed value@xcite for @xmath23m@xmath24",
    ", this resistivity value gives an elastic mean free path of @xmath25 nm , and therefore a superconducting coherence length @xmath26  25  nm ( in the dirty limit ) .",
    "these values are noticeably smaller than those obtained for the reference antidot sample ( @xmath27 nm and @xmath28  nm ) . since in a film without antidots coevaporated with the sample containing the composite antidot",
    "was obtained @xmath27 nm , this difference seems to be caused by the more complex lift - off procedure due to the presence of the small holes .    knowing the",
    "mean free path @xmath29 and using the london penetration depth for the bulk@xcite pb we obtain @xmath30  nm .",
    "due to the perforation , the effective penetration depth increases , and therefore @xmath31 should be modified according to@xcite    @xmath32    where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the area of the holes and the total area per unit cell , respectively . as a result ,",
    "the ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath35 amounts to @xmath36 , and therefore this sample is a type - ii superconductor.@xcite    the sample has been characterized by means of atomic force microscopy .",

    "the root - mean - square roughness on a 1  @xmath6m@xmath24 area of the sample in between the antidots is @xmath38  nm . this value is about two times larger than for the plane film and the reference sample with antidots .",
    "this difference reinforces the idea that the film with the composite antidot lattice has suffered a small degradation due to a more complicated lift - off procedure .",
    "we have measured the critical temperature   as a function of field for the sample with a composite antidot lattice .",
    "the results obtained with a resistance criterion of 10 % of the normal state resistance @xmath17 and a measuring current of @xmath39a are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : chc_tch ] , together with the phase boundary obtained for the reference antidot film .",
    "the solid line depicts the expected upper critical field boundary of a plain film with the same coherence length as the reference antidot sample according to @xmath40 .",
    "it is important to notice that the measured boundary of the reference antidot film is close to the @xmath41 line corresponding to the surface nucleation of superconductivity around the holes , whereas the solid line represents the bulk superconducting transition @xmath42 . as a rule",
    ", the experimentally determined critical temperature   of a patterned sample turns out to be higher than that obtained for a plain film with the same coherence length.@xcite    due to the presence of the antidot array , matching features appear in   with a periodicity of @xmath43  g , corresponding to the lattice parameter @xmath44  @xmath6 m .",
    "although not all of them are very pronounced , local maxima are visible in the   of the composite array for all integer matching fields @xmath45 ( @xmath46,2 , ... , 6 ) , whereas no evidence of rational matching features is observed .",
    "thus , _ the addition of the extra antidot in the center of the unit cell of the array with large antidots , leaves the matching period unchanged_. this is an important observation , since the composite antidot lattice can also be regarded as a square lattice , tilted by 45@xmath47 , with a unit cell twice as small as that of the original lattice .",
    "if this were the periodicity felt by the vortices , the matching period would amount to 18.4  g , which is twice as large as the observed period . in that case , one would expect the local maxima at even matching fields @xmath45 ( @xmath48,4 , ... ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : chc_tch ] to be more pronounced than the ones at odd matching fields @xmath45 ( @xmath46,3 , ... ) .",
    "since this is not the case , we conclude that all these peaks correspond to integer matching fields , indicating that _ the main period felt by the vortices is the period of the lattice with large antidots_.    in order to identify the vortex patterns at the matching fields , we have plotted the @xmath49 transition width @xmath50@xmath51 as a function of @xmath52 in fig .",
    "[ fig : chc_deltatch ] ( filled symbols ) . in this plot",
    "three different regimes can be clearly distinguished .",

    ", we observe that the   transition width remains almost constant . for fields higher than @xmath54 ,",
    "an increase of the transition width can be observed , superposed with matching features at @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "we interpret the _ sudden increase in the transition width as a crossover to the regime where interstitial vortices appear in the sample_.    the interstitial regime is indicated by the gray area in fig .",
    "[ fig : chc_deltatch ] for the composite array .",
    "this regime ranges up to 3.6  @xmath57 , i.e. up to @xmath58 , where a change in the   slope can be observed . for higher fields ,",
    "the single object regime is entered , where a linear phase boundary slightly distorted by an oscillation with period@xcite @xmath59 g , is expected . although the linear phase boundary is indeed observed , single object oscillations are difficult to resolve in the narrow field range investigated . for comparison , in the same figure",
    "we show @xmath50@xmath60 for the reference antidot sample ( open symbols ) . from this curve",
    "we can infer that if the smaller additional antidots are absent , the crossover to the interstitial regime occurs at @xmath61 .",
    "therefore the presence of the additional smaller antidots has substantially delayed the appearance of interstitial vortices . from the   curve ,",
    "we thus conclude that _ the total number of trapped flux quanta per unit cell of the antidot lattice is at least four_.    in other words , the observed saturation number is much larger than in the reference antidot sample , where only a @xmath2-vortex can be pinned per antidot . even taking into account the fact that the large antidots in the composite antidot lattice are slightly larger ( @xmath62 m ) than in the reference antidot sample ( @xmath63 m ) and the difference in coherence length , this is still a rather surprising observation .",
    "indeed , the addition of _ one _ small hole per unit cell of the antidot array leads to an unexpected _ increase of the number of pinned flux quanta per unit cell from one to four_.      to determine the number of flux quanta located in the large and the small antidots of the composite antidot array , a further investigation of the   phase boundary is needed . as explained in ref .",

    ", , \\label{shiftedparabolicbackground}\\ ] ] using @xmath70  k and an effective antidot size of @xmath71 m . from this",
    ", we deduce that , after the second matching field @xmath67 , _ the film with a composite antidot lattice with a filled small antidot behaves as if it would have contained a single square antidot array , but with a larger antidot size _ ( @xmath71 m ) .",
    "the following scenario might explain such a behavior .",
    "up to @xmath3 , the vortices will be attracted towards the large antidots . between @xmath3 and @xmath67 ,",
    "vortices begin to occupy the small antidots . due to their size ,",
    "these small antidots trap at most a single quantum vortex .",
    "they will therefore be completely saturated at @xmath67 , creating a repulsive potential at the position of the small antidot .",
    "[ fig : chc_potential ] shows a schematic evolution of the potential landscape along a diagonal of the array ( see dotted line in the inset ) that would be experienced by a vortex for @xmath68 , @xmath3 , and @xmath67 .",
    "since the large antidots pin one flux quantum , at @xmath72 a surface barrier has emerged at the antidot edges . for @xmath73 , the contribution to the potential of the small antidot at the center of the unit cell is strongly repulsive .",
    "when additional vortices enter the sample , they will be pushed towards the large antidots , leading to an increase of their effective saturation number . in other words ,",
    "_ the additional repulsive potential at the small antidots helps to increase the saturation number of the larger antidots_. within this scenario , for @xmath11 , the phase boundary   of the composite antidot lattice with a saturated smaller antidot resembles strongly the phase boundary expected for a simple square antidot lattice , without small antidots in the center , but with a larger antidot size . due to this larger effective size , these antidots are then able to trap more vortices .",
    "_ we therefore conclude that of the four flux quanta trapped per unit cell of the composite antidot lattice , one is pinned by the small antidot , while three are pushed into the larger holes .",
    "_ the net effect of the addition of the smaller hole in the antidot film , is to increase the effective pinning capacity ( or effective saturation number ) of the lattice with large antidots .",
    "this leads to a substantial broadening of the field range where a strong   enhancement is observed .",
    "a similar picture was introduced by doria and co - workers to explain the multiple trapping of vortices at high fields , as a result of the pressure exerted by the external vortices into the pinning site.@xcite    the potential at @xmath73 , drawn schematically in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : chc_potential ] , can be seen as a checkerboard pattern with consecutively a repulsive and an attractive site . in a recent calculation , lindquist and riklund",
    "have modified the classical problem of a two - dimensional electron gas exposed to a magnetic field @xcite by adding a periodic checkerboard - like on - site potential with alternating signs @xcite .",
    "since the lowest energy level @xmath74 , found for this classical problem , corresponds to the   phase boundary of a simple square antidot lattice in the `` collective '' regime , we believe that the addition of the checkerboard on - site potential in the theory corresponds to our experimental situation for the composite antidot lattice at fields higher than the second matching field ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "these authors showed that both the integer and the rational matching features in @xmath74 are smeared out in the checkerboard system .",
    "these results may explain why the matching features in   are much weaker for @xmath75 , than for @xmath76 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : chc_tchfit ] ) .",
    "indeed , it is only when @xmath67 is exceeded that the checkerboard - like pinning potential is realized experimentally .    summarizing the results of the   phase boundary measurements , the composite antidot lattice shows enhanced pinning , with many integer matching features appearing for fields up to @xmath56 .",
    "the broadening of the   transition after @xmath54 indicates that at least four flux quanta can be trapped per antidot . from the shift in magnetic field of the parabolic background of   with one matching period",
    ", we have deduced that the small antidot pins a @xmath2-vortex , while @xmath77-vortices are trapped by the large antidots .",
    "the presence of the additional small antidot in the center of the unit cell has therefore led to a substantial broadening of the collective regime , or , in other words , to an increase of the effective saturation number @xmath78 of the large antidots from one to three .",
    "so far we have explored the normal - superconducting boundary in order to experimentally determine the extension of the different regimes given by the ratio @xmath79 .",
    "now we turn to isothermal critical current measurements which allow us to study the vortex dynamics deep in the superconducting state .",

    "this value is a factor @xmath82 lower than the critical current density obtained for the reference antidot lattice , in part due to the difference in @xmath83 and @xmath84 , which eventually determine the pinning properties .",
    "the specific geometry of the lateral nanopatterning might also influence the current distribution throughout the film , hereby also affecting the critical current @xmath85 . in order to compare the pinning properties of the film with the composite antidot lattice ( open symbols ) and the reference antidot lattice ( solid lines ) measured at the same reduced temperature we have normalized the critical current by @xmath85 .",

    "@xmath86 which in turn depends solely on the reduced temperature @xmath87 , _ regardless the value of the applied magnetic field _",

    "this behavior is expected at temperatures sufficiently close to @xmath93 , where it is not possible to have interstitial vortices in the superconducting strands between the antidots . as we have already deduced from the shape of the   phase boundary ( section  [ composite_tch ] )",
    ", interstitial vortices indeed appear in the sample only for @xmath94 .    at a lower temperature , @xmath95 ( fig .  [ fig : chc_ich0997_3 ] , lower panel ) , and all temperatures below that ( fig .",
    "[ fig : chc_ich0986_74 ] ) , a strong enhancement of /@xmath88 in the film with a composite antidot lattice can be found for fields higher than the first matching field @xmath3 , compared to the reference antidot lattice .",
    "the reason for this lies in the _ ability of the composite antidot lattice to pin more flux quanta inside the antidots compared to the reference antidot array _ ( see section  [ composite_tch ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that the field range where the film has a finite critical current , i.e. where the film remains superconducting , is considerably broader for the composite than for the reference antidot array .",
    "the appearance and sharpness of the matching features in the /@xmath88 curves , are temperature dependent . at @xmath95 ( fig .",

    "the local maximum has developed into a pronounced cusp , after which a substantial change in the /@xmath88 slope occurs .",
    "a second smaller slope change can be found at @xmath97 . at the lowest measured temperature , @xmath81 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : chc_ich0986_74 ] , lower panel ) , the only matching features left are the sharp local maxima at @xmath3 , @xmath67 , and @xmath92 , and one pronounced cusp at @xmath97 .",
    "it appears that , at this temperature , the seventh matching field @xmath97 plays the same role as the sixth matching field @xmath56 at @xmath96 .",
    "this fact leads us to believe that at @xmath81 , _ the total number of trapped flux quanta per unit cell of the composite lattice , has increased from four to five_.    it is worth to notice that the normalized critical current at the first matching field @xmath3 reaches approximately the same value for the film with the composite and with the reference antidot lattice , except for the /@xmath88 curve taken at @xmath91 .",
    "this fact makes the film with the reference antidot array a good candidate to compare its pinning properties with those of the composite antidot array .",
    "the periodic matching features in the   phase boundary and in the critical current versus field curves   demonstrate that the composite antidot lattice can stabilize commensurate vortex lattices at several magnetic fields . from the results presented in section  [ composite_tch ] ,",
    "it is clear that the large antidots trap at least three flux quanta , while the smaller antidots are saturated after pinning one single quantum vortex .",
    "the vortex patterns expected in the composite antidot lattice will therefore differ from the known patterns in simple square pinning arrays .",

    "two interpenetrating arrays of gaussian sites with a different radius and a different pinning force were used .",
    "this was necessary to obtain an occupation of @xmath98-vortices in the large pinning sites , and of one @xmath99-vortex in the small pinning sites . by applying an annealing course , in which the temperature is lowered , starting from a high temperature and a random distribution of vortices , the most stable configuration in the given pinning potential can be found .",
    "as the temperature is lowered , the pinning sites become smaller and stronger , scaling with @xmath86 in the following way @xcite :    @xmath100    where @xmath101 is the single site pinning force .",
    "additionally , the vortex - vortex interaction range reduces with decreasing temperature , due to the decrease of the magnetic penetration depth @xmath31 . in this type of simulation ,",
    "the occupation of the pinning sites lowers with decreasing temperature .",
    "the annealing course was therefore stopped when the occupation , corresponding to our experimental situation , was achieved .",

    "all patterns , except the one at @xmath54 , are obtained from the molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "multi - quanta vortices are represented in this model by a multiple occupation of a pinning site with ( repulsive ) single - quantum vortices . since in the experiment ,",
    "the pinning sites consist of real holes in the film , the vortices trapped in the same pinning site will be interpreted as multi - quanta vortices , even though they are depicted as separate single flux quantum entities in the plots .",

    "although the overall features in both cases are very much alike.@xcite    the vortex pattern at @xmath54 , which is drawn schematically and was not calculated , depicts all antidots occupied with the maximum number of vortices . the large antidots trap @xmath102-vortices , the smaller antidots trap a @xmath99-vortex .",

    "surprisingly , the   curves ( see e.g. fig .  [",
    "fig : chc_ich0986_74 ] ) show only very weak matching features at @xmath54 .",

    "there is one interstitial vortex present per unit cell of the array .",
    "it is , however , not evident where this vortex is located , since the most logical position , at the center of the unit cell , is already occupied by the filled smaller antidot .",
    "one can see a tendency of the interstitial vortices to form diagonal lines , which make zigzag traces across the sample , indicated by dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : chc_patternh6](b ) .",

    "a highly symmetric vortex pattern is formed . in this case ,",

    "the calculations were not able to produce a regular vortex pattern with an occupation of three at the large pinning sites and one at the smaller pinning sites .",

    "indeed , the cylindrical symmetry of the @xmath103-vortex , as it occurs in the experiment , will make it easier to obtain a regular vortex pattern .",
    "the vortex patterns suggested in this section remain to be directly verified by using a local scanning technique , such as low temperature scanning hall probe microscopy .",
    "further insight into the vortex pinning and dynamics in systems with a composite pinning array may also be gained from molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "we have used a composite antidot lattice , consisting of two interpenetrating antidot arrays with a different antidot size , but with the same lattice period , as a strong periodic pinning potential for the vortex lattice in a superconducting film .",
    "the shift between the two lattices is such that the smaller antidots are situated exactly at the centers of the cells of the array of large antidots .",
    "we have shown that this pinning array can stabilize the vortex lattice at several matching fields from @xmath3 to @xmath97 .",
    "measurements of the critical temperature   and current /@xmath88 as a function of magnetic field , have demonstrated that the composite antidot lattice can trap a considerably higher amount of flux quanta per unit cell ( four or five instead of one ) inside the antidots , compared to a reference antidot film without the additional small antidots in the center of the unit cell .",
    "this means that the appearance of interstitial vortices in the composite antidot lattice is delayed to higher magnetic fields .",
    "the presence of the smaller antidots has therefore increased the effective saturation number of the large antidots , which has led to a considerable expansion of the field range in which an enhanced critical current is observed .",
