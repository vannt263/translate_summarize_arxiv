    "measurements of the cosmic - ray flux from experiments , both on the ground and above the atmosphere , are presented in figure  [ allparticle ] and show the cosmic - ray flux falling as a near featureless power law over 30 decades .",
    "accurate measurements of the elemental composition and individual energy spectra has , however , been an experimental challenge for many years . to date , few measurements of the energy spectra above 10@xmath7  ev  particle@xmath1 have been made for individual elements . in this paper",
    "we review an effort by the tracer group to directly measure the elemental composition of cosmic rays up to 10@xmath0  ev  particle@xmath1 .",
    "the tracer ( `` transition radiation array for cosmic energetic radiation '' ) instrument is a balloon borne detector and probably the largest cosmic - ray detector ever flown above the atmosphere .",
    "tracer has had three successful balloon flights since 1999 , yielding an exposure of @xmath870  m@xmath9  sr  days .",
    "the observational goal of the first two flights of tracer was to measure the individual energy spectra of the heavy elements o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca , and fe . for the third flight",
    "the instrument was upgraded to be sensitive to the light - medium elements b , c , and , n. future flights of tracer are proposed and would include measurements of the the sub - fe elements sc , ti , v , cr , and mn .",
    "this review begins with an overview of the tracer concept and a description of the instrument in section  [ sec : tracer ] .",
    "the analysis of the tracer data is detailed in section  [ sec : analysis ] and the resulting energy spectra are presented and compared with measurements from other experiments in section  [ sec : results ] .",

    "a successful cosmic - ray experiment must determine for each nucleus both the nuclear charge _",

    "tracer realizes this goal by combining scintillation and cherenkov counters to measure the charge , together with a _ de / dx _ counter and a transition radiation detector ( trd ) to measure the energy of individual particles up to 10@xmath0  ev  per  particle ( see figure  [ tracer ] ) .",
    "the key feature on tracer is the employment of a trd to measure the energy or lorentz factor of cosmic - ray nuclei up to 10@xmath0  ev  per  particle .",
    "this application of trd s is more challenging than their use as threshold devices in accelerator or cosmic - ray measurements [ , , ] , where one just wishes to discriminate between particles of the same energy but different mass ( e.g. electrons and pions or protons ) .",
    "key features which distinguish trd s from conventional energy measuring devices such as magnet spectrometers or hadronic calorimeters include : ( a ) a favorable area - to - weight ratio , which is important for weight - restricted - instruments on balloons or spacecraft ( b ) the possibility of accelerator calibrations with beams of electrons or pions at large lorentz factors , for which beams of nuclei are not available ( c ) the fact that the tr - signal scales strictly with @xmath11",
    ". therefore , relative signal fluctuations decrease as @xmath12 , making possible increasingly precise measurements for particles with higher charge . on the other hand , large signal fluctuations at low @xmath13 restrict this use of trd s to cosmic - ray nuclei heavier than helium ( @xmath14 3 ) ( d ) a good match between the lorentz - factor range of a trd ( 400 - 10@xmath15 ) and the range of energies that should be covered in direct measurements ( e ) the possibility of redundant measurements in a layered radiator / detector configuration ( f ) good energy resolution , typically of the order of 10% or better for the heavier nuclei at @xmath16 1000 .",
    "traditionally , a trd uses multiwire proportional chambers ( mwpc s ) as x - ray detectors .",
    "mwpc s require the use of a pressurized container , as employed in the cosmic ray nuclei ( crn ) experiment which was the first trd flown in space [ ] . the weight of such a container is large , and the need for it can be avoided by the approach taken by tracer . for the tracer instrument the mwpc s are replaced with layers of thin - walled single wire proportional tubes which can easily withstand internal overpressure .     ,",

    "payloads are presently limited to @xmath82700  kg , of which @xmath8700  kg is reserved for satellite telemetry interfaces , ballast and landing gear ( parachute and crush pad ) .",
    "tracer is at the upper limit in terms of size and weight for a balloon payload .",
    "the employment of a trd , without the need of a pressurized container allows for the construction of a large area detector ( 2.06  x  2.06  m@xmath9 ) , resulting in an overall geometric factor of 5  m@xmath9sr .",
    "the individual components of tracer are shown in figure  [ tracer ] and are summarized here . from top",
    "to bottom the instrument consists of :    * _ scintillator counter _ : a plastic counter ( bicron-408 ) that has an active area of 2  m x 2  m and is 0.5 cm thick . the counter is read out via wavelength shifter bars ( bicron 482 ) by 24 photomultiplier tubes ( photonis xp1910 ) . * _ de / dx counter _ : an array of 800 single wire proportional tubes .",
    "each tube is 2  m long and 2 cm in diameter and the walls , which are made of mylar , are 127 @xmath17 m thick .",

    "* _ cherenkov counter _ :",
    "an acrylic counter with refractive index = 1.49 is placed at the bottom of the stack .",
    "the active area of the counter is 2  m x 2  m and the thickness is 1.27  cm .",
    "the counter is also read out , via wavelength shifting bars , by 24 pmts .",
    "the scintillator counters act as a trigger for the instrument and together with the cherenkov detector measure the nuclear charge _",
    "z _ of each individual cosmic - ray particle traversing the instrument .",
    "the array of all 1600 proportional tubes determines the trajectory of each cosmic - ray particle through the instrument .",
    "the energy response of the tracer detector spans 4 decades in energy and is shown in figure  [ esig ] .",
    "this extensive energy range is accomplished by combining three complementary measurements : cherenkov light measurement ( @xmath18  ev ) , the relativistic rise of the ionization signal in gas ( @xmath19  ev ) and the measurement of transition radiation ( @xmath20  ev ) .     in each detector [ from ave et al.],scaledwidth=95.0% ]      tracer has had three successful flights on high altitude balloon thus far .",

    "for this flight , the trigger threshold was set at a signal level corresponding to a nuclear charge between lithium and beryllium .",
    "this allowed for full efficiency for the lighter elements boron , carbon , and nitrogen in addition to the heavier elements .",

    "[ ] , where the analysis is discussed in greater detail .",
    "analysis of data collected in _",
    "flight iii _ is currently ongoing .",
    "the analysis of the tracer data begins with the reconstruction of the trajectory of each cosmic - ray particle through the instrument .",
    "the accurate knowledge of the particle trajectory is essential to the analysis for two reasons ; first , it permits corrections of the scintillator and cherenkov signals due to spatial non - uniformities and zenith - angle variations , second , it makes it possible to determine accurately the energy per unit pathlength deposited by each cosmic ray traversing the proportional tubes .",
    "the trajectory of cosmic rays through the instrument is reconstructed for signals recorded in the entire proportional tube array .",
    "the reconstruction follows a two step procedure . as a first estimate ,",
    "the trajectory is obtained by constructing a straight line fit to the center of each of the tubes hit in an event .",
    "all possible combinations of these tubes are fit in the x- and y - projections , and the combination with the minimum @xmath24 per degree of freedom and maximum number of tubes hit is kept .",
    "this procedure reconstructs the trajectories of over 95% of all cosmic - ray particles , with a lateral accuracy in the track position of 5  mm . the trajectory is then refined using the fact that the energy deposited in each tube is proportional to the track length in that tube .",
    "taking this fact into account , an accuracy of 2  mm in lateral track position is achieved , which corresponds to a 3% uncertainty in the total path length through all tubes .",
    "the charge is determined for each cosmic - ray particle using the signals from the scintillation and cherenkov counters .",
    "the signals are corrected for spatial non - uniformities in the counter responses using the trajectory information together with response maps recorded with muons on the ground .",
    "figure  [ charge ] shows a correlation of the signals from the top scintillator and cherenkov counters .",
    "particles of constant charge are clustered along the lines , with the position on the line dependent on the primary energy .",
    "a charge histogram is then constructed through the summation along these lines of constant charge .",
    "the resulting charge resolution is both charge and energy dependent . for oxygen nuclei ( z=8 )",
    "the charge evolves from 0.25 at energies below 3 gev amu@xmath1 to 0.30 charge units at higher energies , while for iron nuclei ( z=26 ) the resolution is 0.5 and 0.6 charge units respectively .    ,",

    "the cherenkov counter identifies particles below minimum ionization energy ( 3  gev  amu@xmath1 ) , and also provides a good energy measurement for these low - energy particles ( see figure  [ esig ] ) . between minimum ionization energy and the onset of tr ( 400  gev  amu@xmath1 ) , the signals in the de / dx counter and the trd are the same and increase logarithmically with energy ( see figure  [ esig ] ) . above 400 gev amu@xmath1 ,",
    "the signals from the de / dx counter and trd diverge , and the rapid increase in the tr signals with particle energy provides an excellent energy measurement . however , cosmic - ray particles in this energy region are extremely rare , being less abundant than particles in the minimum ionization energy region by more than 4 orders of magnitude . to uniquely",
    "identify these rare cosmic - ray particles , it is required that particles with low - energy are identified and removed on the basis of their cherenkov signals . to select the highest energy events",
    ", it is required that the measurement in the de / dx counter places these particles at an energy level well above minimum ionization energy and the presence of tr is detected .",

    "cosmic - ray particles below minimum ionization energy have been removed with the aid of the cherenkov counter .",
    "the small black points represent particles with energies below the onset of tr .",
    "as the signals from the trd and de / dx counter are similar in this energy regime , the correlation of the signals lies along the diagonal . at the onset of tr , where the trd and the de / dx signals diverge ,",
    "the highest energy events show up away from the diagonal line .",
    "the off - diagonal position of these highest energy particles defines them uniquely as tr events for this selected charge .",
    "the highest energy neon nucleus in this data sample has an energy of @xmath25  ev  particle@xmath1 .",
    "once each cosmic - ray particle has been assigned an energy it is sorted into energy bins of width @xmath26e@xmath27 and a differential energy spectrum is constructed for each elemental species . to convert from the number of events @xmath26n@xmath27 in a particular energy bin @xmath26e@xmath27 to an absolute flux _",

    "existing data from measurements in space with heao-3 ( open diamonds [ ] ) and crn ( open crosses [ ] ) are shown for comparison . for completeness , data on the light primary cosmic ray components ( protons , helium , and carbon ) which are not measured with tracer are also included .",
    "these data come from measurements in space ( ams [ ] ) and on balloons ( atic [ ] , bess [ , ] , caprice [ ] , jacee [ ] , runjob [ ] ) .",
    "note the large range in intensity ( 10 decades ) and particle energy ( 4 decades ) covered by tracer .",
    "as can be seen , the energy spectra for o , ne , mg , and fe extend up to and beyond 10@xmath3 ev particle@xmath1 .",
    "the energy range is limited by the current exposure and not by the saturation of the trd .",
    "no significant change in spectral slope is evident at the highest energies .",
    "the energy spectrum of each element , as measured by tracer , can be fit to a power law above 20 gev amu@xmath1 ( dashed line in figure  [ spectra ] ) .",

    "figure  [ iron ] also illustrates the variety of detection techniques used in measuring the energy of heavy nuclei . within the statistical uncertainties ( which in some measurements are quite large ) , the data indicate fairly consistent results .",
    "also presented in figure  [ iron ] are recent results from the ground based hess imaging air cherenkov telescope using the direct cherenkov technique [ ] . here , two flux values are presented for each energy arising from ambiguities from different nuclear interaction models used in the data analysis [ ] .",
    "again , the hess results are consistent with tracer .     from tracer ( solid squares ) compared with the interpretation of air - shower data of kascade ( filled triangles , for two different interaction models : antoni et al .",
    "( 2005 ) ) and of eas - top ( open crosses , two data points for each energy represent upper and lower limits : navarra et al .",
    "[ from ave et al.],scaledwidth=95.0% ]      data for oxygen and iron nuclei from tracer are compared in figure  [ airshower ] with energy spectra derived from indirect air - shower observations of the eas - top collaboration [ ] and of the kascade group [ ] .",
    "these experiments report results for groups of elements and not individual elements ; therefore the fluxes for the `` cno group '' probably have about twice the intensity than oxygen alone while the `` iron group '' is probably dominated by iron .",
    "furthermore , these results remain ambiguous as they depend strongly on the choice of the nuclear interaction model used in the analysis .",
    "the tracer results do not yet overlap with the energy region of the air - shower data .",
    "additional measurements with tracer should help to close the gap and to provide significant constraints on the interpretation of air - shower results .",
    "extending the energy spectra of the heavy elements towards 10@xmath0  ev  particle@xmath1 is an ongoing goal of tracer .",
    "however , to determine the energy spectra and relative abundances for each nuclear species at the cosmic - ray source , the mode of galactic propagation must be understood .",
    "the simplest model of cosmic - ray propagation assumes an equilibrium between the production of cosmic rays , from acceleration at the source or from spallation of heavier nuclei , and their loss from competing actions of escape from the galaxy and spallation on the interstellar medium [ ] . this model can be described as :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the observed intensity of element @xmath30 , @xmath31 the propagation pathlength , @xmath32 the spallation pathlength , @xmath33 the rate of production in the cosmic - ray source , @xmath34 , @xmath35 the average density of the interstellar medium , @xmath36 the intensity of element @xmath37 , and @xmath38 the spallation mean free path for an element @xmath37 to spallate to element @xmath30 .",

    "the hashed area represents the energy region attainable from the 5-day flight of tracer in 2006.,scaledwidth=65.0% ]    the energy dependent propagation pathlength @xmath31 can be derived from the flux ratio of secondary spallation produced particles to primary accelerated particles .",
    "this flux ratio has been observed to decrease with increasing energy [ ] , indicating that the mean lifetime or propagation pathlength of cosmic rays in the galaxy decreases with energy . as an example",
    ", the boron to carbon flux ratio as measured by heao-3 [ ] and crn [ ] is shown in figure  [ bc ] .",
    "the flux ratio has been parameterized with @xmath41 [ ] .",
    "however , this flux ratio has been measured accurately only to about 10@xmath7  ev particle@xmath1 .",
    "it may well be that the flux ratio will eventually reach a finite asymptotic value @xmath42 ( i.e. @xmath43 ) .",
    "the residual pathlength @xmath42 would represent the minimum amount of matter high - energy particles must encounter during propagation from the cosmic - ray source to earth .",
    "alternatively , some diffusion propagation models expect a kolmogorov spectrum with @xmath44 ( see [ ] for a comprehensive review , and references therein ) .",
    "figure  [ bc ] illustrates that none of these scenarios can not be fully ruled out with the present data .",
    "an extension of the boron - carbon flux ratio was a major science goal of _ flight iii _ of tracer in 2006 .",
    "it is expected that even with the limited exposure obtained in _ flight iii _ , the measurement of the boron - carbon flux ratio will reach into the 10@xmath45 - 10@xmath3  ev  particle@xmath1 range .",
    "this energy region is represented as the shaded area in figure  [ bc ] .     of purely secondary elements ( b and sub - fe ) and mixed elements ( primary and secondary : n , ar , and ca ) from the heao-3 ( open diamonds ) , crn ( open crosses ) and tracer ( solid squares ) .",

    "the sub - fe elements are produced by the spallation of iron nuclei during propagation .",
    "figure  [ future ] shows the currently available energy spectra for the sub - fe elements along with b , c , ar , and ca spectra .",
    "the energy spectra for the sub - fe elements do not yet reach 10@xmath7  ev  particle@xmath1 .    tracer is unable to measure the energy spectra for the sub - fe elements with the present detector configuration .",
    "the main reasons for this are the limited charge resolution , due to nonlinearity of the scintillator response at high charges , and the limited photo - electron statistics of the cherenkov counter .",
    "it is therefore proposed to replace one of the acrylic cherenkov counters with a counter containing an aerogel radiator ( refractive index 1.04 ) , and to use a more efficient readout system for the second acrylic cherenkov counter .",
    "for relativistic particles the charge would then be reconstructed using the acrylic and the aerogel cherenkov counters .",
    "contrary to the behavior of the scintillators , both signals are strictly proportional to @xmath11 and the charge resolution would be independent of charge .",
    "this technique has been successfully utilized in the balloon borne trans iron galactic recorder ( tiger ) instrument [ ] , which achieved a charge independent resolution of 0.22 charge units .",

    "the tracer program has pioneered the development of a trd using proportional tube arrays to directly measure the energy spectra of cosmic - ray nuclei .",
