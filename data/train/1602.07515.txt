    "quantum information has recently suggested new problems and new investigations in logic .",
    "an interesting example concerns an abstract theory of _ epistemic logical operations _ ( like `` to know '' ) developed in a hilbert space environment @xcite .",
    "most standard approaches to epistemic logics have proposed a quite strong characterization of epistemic operations . in such frameworks knowledge",
    "is generally modelled as a _",
    "potential _ rather than an _ actual _ knowledge .",
    "accordingly , a sentence like `` alice knows that the spin - value in the @xmath3-direction is up '' turns out to have the meaning `` alice _ could _ know '' rather than `` alice _ actually _ knows '' .",
    "a consequence of these theories is the unrealistic phenomenon of _ logical omniscience _",
    "according to which whenever alice knows a given sentence , then alice knows _ all _ the logical consequences thereof .",
    "hence , for instance , knowing the axioms of euclidean geometry should imply knowing all the theorems of the theory .    a more realistic logical theory of knowledge can be developed in the framework of _ quantum computational logics _",
    "@xcite , which are new forms of quantum logic suggested by the theory of _ quantum logical gates _ in quantum computation . the basic ideas that underly the semantic characterization of these logics can be sketched as follows .",
    "pieces of quantum information ( mathematically represented by density operators of convenient hilbert spaces ) are regarded as possible _ meanings _ for the sentences of a given formal language . at the same time , the basic logical connectives of this language are interpreted as particular quantum logical gates : unitary quantum operations that transform density operators in a reversible way . accordingly , any sentence can be imagined as a synthetic logical description of a quantum circuit .",
    "is it possible and interesting to describe _ logical epistemic operations _ ( say , `` at time @xmath1 alice knows '' ) as a special kind of quantum operation ?",
    "we give a positive answer to this question .",
    "the intuitive idea is the following : whenever @xmath4 represents a piece of quantum information ( for instance the qubit @xmath5 ) , the operation @xmath6 ( say , `` at time @xmath7 alice knows '' ) transforms @xmath4 into another piece of quantum information @xmath8 , which lives in the same space of @xmath4 and asserts that `` at time @xmath7 alice knows @xmath4 '' . of course ,",
    "generally , @xmath9 and @xmath4 will be different density operators . on this basis",
    ", one can study the behavior of nested epistemic operations , like `` at time @xmath0 bob knows that at time @xmath1 alice knows @xmath4 '' ( @xmath10 ) .    like any quantum information , also epistemic pieces of information ( say , @xmath8 ) may be _ true _ or _ false _ or _ indeterminate _ , where truth - values are defined in terms of a natural notion of quantum probability .",
    "conventionally , one can assume that the two elements @xmath5 and @xmath11 of the canonical orthonormal basis of the hilbert space @xmath2 represent in this framework the truth - values _",
    "truth _ and _ falsity_. accordingly ( by application of the born - rule ) , the probability of being true for a generic qubit @xmath12 will be the number @xmath13 .",
    "the definition of born - like probabilities can be canonically extended to all density operators , living in any product - space @xmath14 .",
    "the choice of an orthonormal basis for the space @xmath2 is , obviously , a matter of convention .",
    "one can consider infinitely many bases that are determined by the application of a unitary operator @xmath15 to the elements of the canonical basis . from an intuitive point of view",
    ", we can think that the operator @xmath15 gives rise to a change of _ truth - perspective_. while the canonical truth - perspective is identified with the pair of bits @xmath5 and @xmath11 , in the @xmath15-truth perspective _",
    "truth _ and _ falsity _ are identified with the two qubits @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively . in this framework ,",
    "it is not strange to guess that different epistemic agents may have different truth - perspectives , corresponding to different ideas of _ truth _ and _",
    "falsity_.    from a physical point of view , each truth - perspective can be naturally regarded as associated to a physical apparatus that allows one to measure a given observable . as an example , consider a source emitting a pair of photons correlated in polarization in such a way that both photons have the same polarization ( say , the horizontal polarization @xmath18 or the vertical polarization @xmath19 ) .",
    "suppose that the two photons are in the entangled state @xmath20 ( with @xmath21 ) .",
    "the orthonormal basis @xmath22 represents here a particular truth - perspective .",
    "let us refer to an observer equipped with a polarizer that detects @xmath23 and @xmath24 polarized photons .",
    "the same state @xmath25 will be represented by the observer from a different truth - perspective , corresponding to the orthonormal basis @xmath26 .",
    "in fact , by applying the transformation @xmath27 the observer will describe the state @xmath25 as @xmath28 notice that a truth - perspective change gives rise to a different description of one and the same physical state @xmath25 .",
    "an important feature that characterizes the knowledge of any agent is represented by the amount of information that is accessible to him / her .",
    "technically , the _ epistemic domain _ of an agent can be identified with a special set of density operators . from an intuitive point of view",
    ", this set can be regarded as the set of pieces of information that our agent is able to _ understand _ and to _ memorize_. and the limits of epistemic domains can be used to avoid the unpleasant phenomenon of logical omniscience .",
    "one can prove that epistemic operations are not generally unitary . from an intuitive point of view",
    ", the _ act of knowing _ seems to involve some intrinsic irreversibility due to possible measurement - procedures or to a loss of information about the environment .    in section 4",
    "we will see how quantum channels are deeply connected with epistemic operations : special examples of irreversible quantum operations that can be used to reach the information stored by density operators .",
    "finally we will also illustrate some relativistic - like effects that arise in the behavior of epistemic agents .",
    "an abstract study of epistemic operations in a hilbert - space environment may have a double interest :    1 .   from a logical point of view",
    "such analysis shows how `` thinking in a quantum - theoretic way '' can contribute to overcome some crucial difficulties of standard epistemic logics .",
    "2 .   from a physical point of view",
    "this analysis stimulates further investigations about possible correlations between the irreversibility of quantum operations and the kind of `` jumps '' that seem to characterize acts of knowledge , both in the case of human and of artificial intelligence .",
    "the general mathematical environment is the @xmath29-fold tensor product of the hilbert space @xmath2 : @xmath30 where all pieces of quantum information live .",
    "the elements @xmath31 and @xmath32 of the canonical orthonormal basis @xmath33 of @xmath2 represent , in this framework , the two classical bits , which can be also regarded as the canonical truth - values _ truth _ and _ falsity _ , respectively . the canonical basis of @xmath34 is the set @xmath35 as usual , we will briefly write @xmath36 instead of @xmath37 . by definition , a _ quregister _ is a unit vector of @xmath34 .",
    "quregisters thus correspond to pure states , namely to maximal pieces of information about the quantum systems that are supposed to store a given amount of quantum information .",
    "we shall also make reference to _ mixtures _ of quregisters , represented by density operators @xmath4 of @xmath34 .",
    "of course , quregisters correspond to special cases of density operators .",
    "we will denote by @xmath38 the set of all density operators of @xmath34 , while @xmath39 will represent the set of all possible pieces of quantum information .",
    "as observed in the introduction , from an intuitive point of view , a basis - change in @xmath2 can be regarded as a change of _ truth - perspective_. while in the classical case , the truth - values _",
    "truth _ and _ falsity _ are identified with the two classical bits @xmath5 and @xmath11 , assuming a different basis corresponds to a different idea of _ truth _ and _ falsity_. since any basis - change in @xmath2 is determined by a unitary operator , we can identify a _ truth - perspective _ with a unitary operator @xmath40 of @xmath2 .",
    "we will write : @xmath41 and we will assume that @xmath42 and @xmath43 represent , respectively , the truth - values _",

    "we consider an epistemic quantum computational language @xmath320 consisting of :    * atomic sentences ; * logical connectives corresponding to the following gates : negation , toffoli , controlled - not , hadamard and square root of negation ; * names for epistemic agents ( say , alice , bob , ... ) ; * logical epistemic operators , corresponding to ( generally irreversible ) epistemic operations .",
    "this language can express sentences like `` alice knows that bob does not know that the spin - value in the @xmath3-direction is up '' .",
    "the semantics for @xmath320 provides a convenient notion of _ model _ , whose role is assigning informational meanings to all sentences .",
    "technically , a model of @xmath320 is defined as a map @xmath321 that associates to any truth - perspective @xmath15 and to any sentence @xmath173 a density operator @xmath322 , living in a hilbert space @xmath323 , whose dimension depends on the linguistic complexity of @xmath173 .    on this basis",
    ", one can give a natural definition for the concepts of _ truth _ and of _ logical consequence _ in terms of the notions of @xmath324-probability ( @xmath325 ) and of @xmath324-preorder ( @xmath74 ) :    * a sentence @xmath173 is _ true _ with respect to a model @xmath321 and to a truth - perspective @xmath15 ( abbreviated as @xmath326 ) iff @xmath327 ; * a sentence @xmath169 is a _ logical consequence _ of a sentence @xmath173 ( abbreviated as @xmath328 ) iff for any model @xmath321 and any truth - perspective @xmath15 , @xmath329    while truth is obviously dependent on the choice of a truth perspective @xmath330 , one can prove that the notion of logical consequence represents an",
    "_ absolute _ relation that is invariant with respect to truth - perspective changes .          *",
    "_ alice _ and _ bob _ may have different ideas about the logical connectives , about truth , falsity and probability . * in spite of these differences , the _ reasoning - rules _ ( which are determined by the logical consequence relation ) are the same for _ alice _ and for _ bob_. apparently , assigning the same interpretation to the logical connectives is not a necessary condition in order to use the same reasoning - rules .",
