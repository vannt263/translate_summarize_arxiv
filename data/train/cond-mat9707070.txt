    "excitons ( @xmath1 ) are crucial to the understanding of optical spectra from quantum wells with a low electron density . if the electron density is increased the excitonic effects are destroyed by phase - space filling from the other electrons and a fermi edge singularity ( fes ) may be seen .",
    "recent experiments have shown that as the electron density is lowered , the fes evolves into a discrete line which is not an exciton but is instead attributed to the negatively charged exciton ( @xmath2 )  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "the negatively charged exciton was first predicted by lampert in analogy with the various ions of hydrogen  @xcite .",
    "further variational studies have been carried out in both three dimensions ( 3d )  @xcite and two dimensions ( 2d )  @xcite .",
    "it is found that the restriction to 2d increases the binding energy of the second electron to about ten times its 3d value .",
    "this should facilitate the observation of the @xmath0 and , consequently , most experimental studies are carried out in the quasi-2d environment of the quantum well . negatively charged excitons were first observed in @xmath3 quantum wells  @xcite  @xcite and were later seen in @xmath4  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "most of the experimental spectra are obtained using polarized photoluminescence ( pl ) techniques .",
    "a constant b - field is often applied perpendicular to the well since this allows a charged exciton to form even at electron densities for which an fes would be seen in zero field  @xcite .",
    "recently the low energy tails of the pl spectra have been examined and evidence of shakeup processes have been found  @xcite .",
    "these occur when the charged exciton undergoes electron - hole recombination leaving the remaining electron in an excited state .",
    "positively charged excitons , consisting of an electron and two holes ( @xmath5 ) have also been observed in p - tpye quantum wells  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical studies of the charged exciton complex consider ideal 2d systems  @xcite and are often restricted to the lowest landau level  @xcite . in a previous paper we showed that the combined effects of ( a ) higher landau level mixing and ( b ) the form factor emulating the finite quantum well width ( i.e. quasi-2d system ) , are essential for understanding recent experimental @xmath0 spectra  @xcite .    in this paper accurate numerical solutions",
    "are presented for a quasi-2d negatively charged exciton ( @xmath0 ) consisting of two electrons and a hole situated in an in - plane confinement potential and a perpendicular uniform b - field .",
    "the @xmath0 properties are studied over a wide range of experimentally accessible b - fields and in - plane confinements .",
    "we consider weak , intermediate and strong in - plane confinements , and use a _ range of initial angular momenta _ for the charged exciton .",
    "we calculate the development with b - field of the following : 1 ) the photoluminescence spectrum 2 ) the shakeup lines in the pl spectrum and 3 ) the electron - hole pair distribution functions . for the case of a weak in - plane confinement we can compare our results to recent experiments in high mobility quantum wells .",
    "we find that theory and experiment match very closely in both the main spectrum ( sec .",
    "[ pl ] ) _ and _ the shakeup lines ( sec .  [ su ] ) . for stronger confinements our results",
    "should be compared to experiments carried out in quantum dots . to our knowledge",
    "no charged exciton species have yet been knowingly observed in quantum dots .",
    "we predict rich signatures characterizing the @xmath0 in the quantum dot and hope that these results may stimulate further experimental study in such systems ( sec .",
    "[ pl ] and sec .",
    "[ su ] ) . finally our study of the electron - hole pair distribution functions allows us understand the structure of the charged exciton species and how this relates to the features of our calculated spectra ( sec .",

    "we also analyse the distribution functions of the excited @xmath0 states finding that increasing excitation reflects a competition between two effects : partial ionization of _ either _ one _ or _ two electrons .",

    "the single particle wavefunctions have characteristic length scales @xmath20 . in this symmetric gauge",
    "the single particle wavefunctions have two quantum numbers , n and m. in the limit of weak confinement @xmath21 the magnetic field dominates and the single particle states form landau levels . for electrons , states with @xmath22 and n=0 are degenerate forming the lowest landau level ; raising n or making @xmath23 positive raises the electron energy and puts it in a higher landau level . for the holes the positive @xmath24 states with n=0 form the lowest hole landau level .    in the case of strong confinement",
    "@xmath25 the single particle states are essentially oscillator states of the parabolic confining potential , where @xmath26 . for",
    "a given n , states with the same @xmath27 are hence degenerate . raising either n or @xmath27 raises the energy by an integral number of @xmath28 .",
    "for both electrons and holes , the states have definite angular momentum , @xmath29 , arising from the rotational invariance of the system .",
    "the experimental data referred to in this paper is all for weak confinements . for simplicity , therefore , we refer to landau levels throughout this paper noting that the landau level is no - longer degenerate when the confinement is strong .",
    "the position of the particle in a given single particle state is closely related to the angular momentum of the state , m. for particles in the lowest landau level ( i.e. n=0 ) : @xmath30    this paper considers three confinements : weak @xmath31 , intermediate @xmath32 and strong @xmath33 .",
    "the cyclotron energies are @xmath34 and @xmath35 at b=10 t. the confinements are chosen to be @xmath361.75 mev in the weak confinement limit , @xmath375.58 mev in the intermediate confinement limit and @xmath3717.6 mev in the strongly confined limit .",
    "for ease of comparison we chose @xmath38 such that @xmath39 , thereby ensuring that the electron and hole wavefunctions have equal characteristic lengths , @xmath40 . in the case of weak confinement",
    "the magnetic field dominates and we can compare our results to those obtained from high mobility quantum wells . for intermediate and strong confinements",
    "the charged exciton is effectively in a quantum dot . in the case of intermediate confinement",
    ", the b - field dominates at reasonably large b while the confinement dominates at low b. the crossover occurs when @xmath41 i.e. when b@xmath426.5 t .",
    "as expected we find interesting changes of behaviour around the crossover field strength .",
    "the interaction potentials are coulombic . in order to obtain a tractable model it is assumed that the single particle wavefunctions separate : @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "a specific form for @xmath45 is chosen , thereby freezing out the z - motion and yielding a quasi-2d model .",
    "there are two different limits we can choose for @xmath45 .",
    "in one limit the electrons and holes occupy the same plane but have their charge distributions smeared in a rod - like distribution along the perpendicular direction ( rod geometry ) . in the other limit the electrons and holes exist on separate planes separated by a distance d ( biplanar geometry ) , their charge distributions being unsmeared .",
    "the biplanar geometry is the relevant limit of systems such as a quantum well in a polarizing electric field which separates the electrons and holes .",
    "the rod geometry is suitable for quantum wells in which the electron and hole distributions are not separated in the direction perpendicular to the well .",
    "we showed in an earlier publication  @xcite that the biplanar geometry does nt exhibit a pl signature of charged excitons for @xmath46 .",
    "this lack of @xmath0 signature has been confirmed experimentally  @xcite for a quantum well in a perpendicular electric field .",
    "consequently we concentrate on the rod geometry in this paper , for which :    @xmath47    in this work we use a rod length @xmath48 . at b=10 t ,",
    "@xmath49  for weak confinement , @xmath50  for intermediate confinement and @xmath51  for strong confinement .",
    "before proceeding with any calculation of charged exciton states it is important to identify the symmetries of the full hamiltonian as these lead to well - defined quantum numbers , thereby allowing us to work within a restricted hilbert space . for the charged exciton the hamiltonian in the symmetric gauge is rotationally invariant and also conserves the total spin .",
    "the good quantum numbers for the charged exciton are therefore the total orbital angular momentum @xmath52 , the total spin @xmath53 and the total z - component of the spin , @xmath54 .",
    "spin conservation , together with the fact that the wavefunction must be antisymmetric under interchange of the two electrons , allows us to label the charged exciton wavefunctions as either triplet or singlet .",
    "the singlet states have s=0 and @xmath55 with an orbital wavefunction which is symmetric under electron interchange .",
    "the triplet states have s=1 and @xmath56 with an orbital wavefunction which is antisymmetric to electron interchange .",
    "thus the charged exciton wavefunctions have the form : @xmath57 where @xmath58 here @xmath59 , @xmath60 are the usual singlet and triplet spin states respectively . the total angular momentum @xmath61 .",
    "the restriction @xmath62 is required to prevent overcounting of states . in the particular limit that the basis is restricted to the lowest landau level ,",
    "the interaction @xmath63 and the in - plane confinement is zero , there is a well documented hidden symmetry  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "this forces the photoluminescence energy from a triplet charged exciton to be indentical to that of the lowest exciton line . in our system",
    "this symmetry is broken by the in - plane confinement and by landau level mixing , the latter being crucial in the case of weak confinement  @xcite .",
    "this breaking of the hidden symmetry is vital if any signature of the triplet charged exciton is to be seen in photoluminescence .",
    "the effects of the b - field and the coulomb interaction compete : from a perturbation theory perspective the expansion parameters are given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the bohr radius for the electron and hole respectively .",
    "taking @xmath66 t and @xmath67 yields ( gaas ) @xmath68 and @xmath69 , thereby rendering any such perturbation approach unreliable .",
    "for this reason we diagonalize the charged exciton hamiltonian exactly numerically .",
    "we perform the diagonalizations in regions of the hilbert space charaterized by quantum numbers for the charged exciton ; i.e. @xmath70 , s and @xmath71 .",
    "the actual basis used has 5 hole landau levels , 2 electron landau levels and 16 angular momentum states per landau level .",
    "a larger number of hole landau levels is used because of the small hole cyclotron energy . a finite number of angular momentum states",
    "is used since the confinement breaks the degeneracy of the landau level . clearly as @xmath72 an increasingly large number of landau levels should be used .",
    "we therefore only quote our calculations for b@xmath73 t , the reliability of the answers increasing rapidly with b - field . from comparison with published experimental data given later in this paper and in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors believe this basis to be sufficient for capturing the essential physics of the charged exciton .",
    "for the purpose of comparison , the exciton states are calculated using the same basis in a manner identical to that used for the charged exciton .",
    "the reliability of the calculation has been verified by reproducing known results as follows : ( a ) in the limit of zero confinement the hidden symmetry result is recovered for b@xmath74 , ( b ) the b=0 confined 2-electron results of ref",
    ".  @xcite are reproduced , ( c ) the main results found in a previous study on an ideal 2d charged exciton  @xcite are obtained .",
    "in this section we consider the photoluminescence ( pl ) spectra of charged and uncharged excitons .",
    "these spectra arise from the recombination of a valence hole with a conduction electron giving out a photon of energy @xmath75 such that @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the initial and final energies respectively .",
    "the recombination process conserves total angular momentum .",
    "the emitted photon has angular momentum @xmath79 which is taken up by the atomic part of the bloch wavefunction ( i.e. transition between s ans p orbitals ) causing the angular momentum of the envelope function to remain unchanged under recombination . throughout this paper",
    "we are only dealing with envelope wavefunctions ( i.e. we neglect bulk @xmath80 bandmixing effects ) hence we have the selection rule @xmath81 .",
    "consequently , only excitons with @xmath70=0 can undergo recombination and contribute to the pl spectrum ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "now consider recombination from charged excitons .",
    "angular momentum must still be conserved , but on recombination an electron is left in the final state .",
    "this electron can have any angular momentum , thereby allowing charged excitons with total angular momentum , m@xmath83 also to contribute to the pl spectrum via @xmath84",
    ". the final electron can be in any landau level provided it has angular momentum @xmath70 .",
    "the higher the energy of the final state electron , the lower the pl photon energy . in this section",
    "we always consider electrons to be in the lowest landau level in the final state .",
    "electrons left in excited states ( i.e. higher landau levels ) are considered later in this paper when we deal with shakeup processes .",
    "we consider the recombination to involve the @xmath85 heavy holes ; this is consistent with the relevant experimental work  @xcite .",
    "these holes combine with @xmath86 electrons giving two circularly polarised lines , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , which are zeeman split by the magnetic field .",
    "the spin of the remaining electron from the charged exciton has no effect on this splitting as its zeeman energy makes the same contribution to the energies of the initial and final states .",
    "experimentally the zeeman splitting of the exciton pl lines is found to be less than that of the charged exciton lines  @xcite . for clarity",
    "therefore the calculated pl lines presented here are situated at the average energies of the @xmath87 and @xmath88 lines ( i.e. taking @xmath89 ) .    as well as the pl energies",
    ", we are interested in the pl strengths . ignoring complications due to population dynamics",
    ", we will take the measure of the pl strengths to be @xmath90 and @xmath91 for @xmath1 and @xmath0 respectively where @xmath92 .",
    "this leads to expressions for pl strengths as follows :    @xmath93    where    @xmath94    here @xmath95 is the total electron spin , @xmath96 is the @xmath97-component of total electron spin and @xmath98 are the expansion coefficients of the singlet / triplet charged exciton .",
    "the @xmath99 are the expansion coefficients of the exciton .",
    "the electron remaining from the charged exciton recombination is in the state with quantum numbers @xmath100 .",
    "it is difficult to predict which of the triplet ( s=1 ) states contributes most to the pl spectrum .",
    "therefore we use @xmath101 as a measure of the pl strength of the triplet line .",
    "we now turn to the photoluminescence ( pl ) spectra of charged and neutral excitons in a weak in - plane confinement . at all",
    "b - fields examined ( i.e. b=@xmath102 tesla ) we find that the ground state of the neutral exciton ( x ) has total angular momentum @xmath103 , the ground state of the singlet charged exciton ( @xmath104 ) has @xmath103 and the ground state of the triplet charged exciton ( @xmath105 ) has @xmath106 .",
    "these all contribute to the pl spectrum . other charged exciton states with m@xmath107",
    "can also luminesce via @xmath108 ; the electron in the final state is left in the lowest landau level .",
    "since these states are very close in energy to the absolute @xmath104 and @xmath105 ground states and their pl lines are also similar , they must be included in a calculation of the pl spectrum .",
    "increasing @xmath27 increases the energy of the @xmath0 state , so we only need to consider those states for which @xmath109m@xmath110 in our calculations .    in a weakly confined system",
    "it makes sense to discuss whether the @xmath0 species are stable to the decomposition @xmath111 .",
    "a charged exciton will decompose if its initial energy is greater than that of the final state consisting of an exciton in its lowest energy state and a free electron in the lowest landau level . in a truly unconfined system ,",
    "the angular momentum of the final state electron is irrelevant due to the degeneracy of the landau level . in our calculations however , the electron single particle energies do vary weakly with @xmath112 thus we assume angular momentum conservation in order to take account of this ; i.e. @xmath113 where the @xmath114 state is the ground state of the magnetoexciton .",
    "this decomposition is closely related to the pl recombination process for @xmath115 . since @xmath114 can recombine directly ( @xmath116 )",
    "it is clear that an @xmath0 state will be stable to this decomposition provided its pl energy is lower than that from the bare exciton .",
    "figure 1 shows the development of the spectrum with b - field for a rod length @xmath48 ( 240  at b=10 t ) and a weak in - plane confinement . to facilitate computation , the rod length is allowed to scale with the characteristic length @xmath117 .",
    "recent work on the interface exciton indeed suggests that some reduction of @xmath118 with b is expected  @xcite .",
    "the spectra are robust to changes in @xmath118 and hence fig.1 retains the experimental features simulated in our earlier paper  @xcite using fixed @xmath50 .",
    "reference  @xcite only fully considered pl spectra from @xmath0 species with @xmath103 . in contrast fig.1",
    "includes optical recombination from the lowest energy singlet and triplet states corresponding to @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "the @xmath104 , @xmath105 and exciton ( @xmath1 ) pl spectra are shown separately .",
    "a gaussian broadening of @xmath121mev fwhm has been introduced .",
    "the spectra in figure 1 agree well with those observed experimentally in quantum wells of width 200 ",
    "300  @xcite .",
    "the pl energies increase with b in a similar way to the experimental data  @xcite ; in addition the theoretical spectrum consists of a predominately @xmath104 peak about 1mev below the exciton line at 8 t ( as compared to the experimentally observed value of 1.7mev at 8 t ) . at low b fig.1 shows an @xmath105 peak above the exciton line .",
    "this is due to recombination from the @xmath103 triplet charged exciton .",
    "this will most likely not be observed experimentally since its position indicates that it is unstable to decompostion into an exciton and electron ( as discussed earlier ) and as such is not expected to form . however , on increasing b , this @xmath105 line can be seen to move through the exciton line , thus becoming stable to decomposition and allowing it to be observed .",
    "this occurs at around 6 tesla .",
    "the appearance of an @xmath105 line near the exciton ( @xmath1 ) line at finite b is also a feature of the experimental spectra in which it occurs at around 2.5 t  @xcite .",
    "the lower energy contribution to the triplet spectra in fig.1 originates from the @xmath105 states with m@xmath122 . as b is increased these clearly lose strength to the m=0 triplet line .",
    "this is a precursor to the hidden symmetry mentioned earlier ; as b increases the low energy states are forced to have more weight in the lowest electron and hole landau levels .",
    "apart from the m@xmath122 triplet lines , the pl strength of the lines generally increases with b. this is much more pronounced for the exciton ( @xmath1 ) and @xmath105 than for @xmath104 .",
    "this effect is observed experimentally  @xcite and agrees quite closely with fig.1 .",
    "the splitting between the exciton ( @xmath1 ) and @xmath104 lines in fig.1 increases with b in a manner similar to that observed experimentally and is more pronounced than that found in our previous study which used a fixed rod length  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the observed increased binding of the @xmath104 with respect to the exciton is to a certain extent due to the scaling with magnetic length of the extent of the exciton and charged exciton wavefunctions perpendicular to the well .",
    "we emphasize that the spectra presented in fig.1 contain recombination from charged excitons with initial angular momenta , @xmath119 , and 0 .",
    "the calculated spectra clearly have all the qualitative , and many of the quantitative features of the experimental spectra .",
    "thus charged excitons with a range of initial angular momenta could be involved in the experimental systems reported to date .",
    "we now consider the pl signatures of charged and uncharged excitons in an intermediate in - plane confinement potential ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "the ground states are found to have angular momentum @xmath103 for the singlet charged exciton , @xmath106 for the triplet and @xmath103 for the exciton .",
    "this is identical to the weakly confined case .",
    "again we examine the pl spectrum from charged excitons with m@xmath110 as these undergo recombination leaving the remaining electron in a state of m@xmath110 which becomes part of the lowest landau level at high enough b - field .",
    "fig.2 shows the calculated pl spectra for the lowest energy singlet and triplet @xmath0 states with @xmath124m@xmath107 together with the pl line from the ground state of the exciton ( m=0 ) .",
    "the exciton is included for comparison but would not be observable in the same quantum dot as a charged exciton since the parabolic confinement holds the electrons and holes together thus preventing complete ionization .",
    "the same rod length is used as in fig.1 .",
    "the in - plane spatial extent of the charged excitons ranges from 300  to 400  at b=10 t ( discussed later ) which is larger than the rod length , @xmath118 ( 220   at b=10 t ) ensuring that the charged excitons retain the quasi-2d nature required by our model .",
    "these spectra contain interesting structure .",
    "the singlet ( @xmath104 ) spectrum is always below the exciton ( @xmath1 ) line and the triplet ( @xmath105 ) spectrum has two parts , one higher than the exciton line which corresponds to the m=0 triplet line , and one at similar energies to the singlet spectrum which corresponds to the @xmath125 triplet states . as b is increased the @xmath1@xmath104 splitting increases slightly ( 1.2mev at 2 t to 1.5mev at 12 t ) in a similar manner to that seen in the weakly confined case .",
    "we also note that the major group of lines show a diamagnetic shift upwards in energy with increasing b. more interesting is the development of the singlet and triplet spectra with b. we shall first consider the singlet spectra . at low b",
    "the only strong line arises from the singlet ground state ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "the @xmath126 lines are arranged below this decreasing in both pl intensity and energy as @xmath70 decreases . as b",
    "is increased these lower @xmath70 lines increase their pl strengths and energies moving through the @xmath103 singlet line around b=7 t . at high",
    "b the lower @xmath70 singlet lines are clearly arranged at higher pl energies than the @xmath103 line with pl strengths sufficiently high to allow them to be observed .",
    "the ordering with increasing pl energy is @xmath127 at high b. the triplet spectrum below the exciton line shows the same development with b - field . as b is increased the @xmath128 triplet lines gain pl strength and move through the ground state ( @xmath106 ) triplet line around b=7 t arranging themselves in the order @xmath126 with increasing pl energy at high b .",
    "the interesting development of this structure with b is due to the competition between the effects of the b - field and the parabolic confinement mentioned in sec .",
    "[ model ] .",
    "this competition is very important in this case of intermediate confinement . at low b",
    "the parabolic in - plane confinement dominates ; this removes the degeneracy of the landau levels and vastly lowers the number of states available to the charged exciton with which to minimize its electrostatic energy . in the lowest energy classical configurations the hole has @xmath129 while the electrons have @xmath130 such that @xmath131 , where @xmath70 is the angular momentum of the charged exciton .",
    "this configuration has negligible overlap between electron and hole single particle wavefunctions giving the very low pl strength at low b for higher @xmath27 as observed in fig.2 .",
    "as b is increased the effect of the confinement begins to disappear as the landau levels form .",
    "the degeneracy at a given @xmath23 and @xmath24 now allows the electrostatic energy to be minimized with finite single particle electron - hole overlap giving the stronger pl strength .",
    "this competition between b - field and confinement also explains the changes in the pl energy orderings .",
    "when the confinement dominates ( i.e.low b - field ) the charged excitons with higher @xmath27 have to leave their extra electron in a higher @xmath27 ( i.e. higher energy ) state after recombination thus pushing the pl line to lower energies .",
    "this effect disappears as b increases and begins to dominate since the degeneracy of the landau levels makes the energies of the final @xmath70 states increasingly similar .",
    "it makes sense , therefore , that the cross - over between these effects occurs around 6.5 t , which is precisely where the expansion parameter , @xmath132 .",
    "finally we turn to the case of a strong in - plane confinement .",
    "fig.3 shows the pl spectra for a rod length @xmath48 and the strong confinement potential .",
    "again the lowest energy state of the singlet charged exciton has total angular momentum @xmath103 , the triplet @xmath106 , and the exciton @xmath103 .",
    "we consider here photoluminescence from the lowest energy singlet and triplet states with angular momenta @xmath133 .",
    "the exciton pl from the ground state ( @xmath103 ) is also shown for comparison . however , as with the case of intermediate confinement , decomposition ( i.e. ionization ) of the charged excitons is not possible here since the strong confinement keeps the number of particles in the quantum dot constant .",
    "we note that the spectral lines posess a diamagnetic shift upwards as b increases .",
    "the form of the spectrum is essentially unchanged over the range of b - fields shown .",
    "this arises because the confinement dominates at all b - fields shown .",
    "thus we see a spectrum which is very similar to the low b - field spectra in fig.2 .",
    "the only lines with significant pl strength are the ground state singlet ( @xmath103 ) , the ground state triplet ( @xmath106 ) together with the lowest @xmath103 triplet state , and the @xmath103 exciton ground state .",
    "the pl strengths of the other lines are low due to the strong confinement as explained above for the intermediate confinement case .",
    "the @xmath103 triplet line lies far above the exciton line .",
    "the @xmath103 singlet , @xmath106 triplet and @xmath103 exciton lines are grouped within 4mev of each other for all b - fields in fig.3 .",
    "the triplet @xmath106 line is now the lowest pl line , then comes the singlet @xmath103 followed by the exciton .",
    "it is only with this very strong confinement that the triplet line drops below the singlet in the pl spectra .",
    "in the previous section we considered recombination from charged excitons in which the electron in the final state was left in the lowest landau level , i.e. @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "we now consider recombinations in which the final electron is left in higher landau levels .",
    "these are known as shakeup processes .",
    "we will concentrate on cases where the final electron is left in the first excited landau level .",
    "these we denote as @xmath136 lines in the pl spectra .",
    "there are two ways in which an @xmath136 pl line may occur . in both cases",
    "the process is @xmath137 ; one case has @xmath138 , the other involves @xmath139 .",
    "we label the two processes @xmath140 and @xmath141 respectively .",
    "these shakeup processes have significantly lower pl strengths than the recombinations dealt with in the previous section .",
    "they still obey the @xmath81 selection rule , however the dipole matrix element is very small . in all figures showing shakeup processes in this paper the strong pl spectrum",
    "is also shown for comparison .",
    "figures 4(a ) and ( b ) show the @xmath140 and @xmath141 pl lines respectively for the case of a weak in - plane confinement with rod length @xmath48 .",
    "these spectra are very similar to recent experimental data for su processes obtained in quantum wells  @xcite .",
    "consider figure 4(a ) which shows the @xmath140 processes .",
    "the energies agree very well with the observed values ( eg the splitting between the shakeup @xmath0 lines and the non - shakeup @xmath0 lines is 7.4mev at 4 t in fig.4(a ) and 6mev experimentally  @xcite ) . as b increases the su lines drop almost linearly .",
    "given the weak confinement we expect the difference between the non - shakeup @xmath0 line and the shakeup line to be @xmath142 , the cyclotron frequency associated with the remaining excited electron .",
    "this is indeed what we find ; the @xmath143 line drops by 1.3mev / t while the nonshakeup @xmath0 rises by about 0.4mev / t , the difference between the two lines being 1.7mev / t corresponding to @xmath142 as expected .",
    "experimentally the @xmath136 line is found to vary linearly with b , however the difference between it and the @xmath0 is slightly less than @xmath142 which has been tentatively attributed to an increase in the electron mass due to penetration of the algaas layer  @xcite . looking in more detail at the calculated spectrum we see that the singlet @xmath140 lines are very weak in comparison to the triplet @xmath140 lines .",
    "the latter dominate the @xmath140 spectrum at low b - field . at b=2 t",
    "the su spectrum is about 100 times weaker than the strong non - shakeup @xmath0 line , this compares very well with the observed intensity ratio from ref .",
    "as b increases the main triplet su line drops rapidly in pl strength thus rendering the @xmath140 unobservable at higher b. this is again found experimentally .",
    "the main triplet line consists predominately of @xmath144 lines , the @xmath145 lines being similar in strength to the singlet lines .",
    "the large drop in shakeup pl strength with b is due to the increased energy difference between landau levels causing the initial charged exciton states to have less contribution from both electron and hole higher landau levels .",
    "fig.4(b ) shows the @xmath141 processes .",
    "again the energies agree well with observed values  @xcite .",
    "the su spectrum is in fact almost identical to that of fig.4(a ) except that now the singlet line dominates and the triplet line is very weak . again at b=2 t the su line is about 100 times smaller than the strong non - shakeup @xmath0 line .",
    "the gradient of the @xmath141 line is 1.3mev / t , the same as that in fig.4(a ) .",
    "the @xmath141 line loses strength rapidly with increasing b - field .",
    "this is again due to the increased energy difference between landau levels causing the charged exciton to have less contribution from both electron and hole higher landau levels .",
    "while both @xmath140 and @xmath141 processes match very well with the observed @xmath136 line , it is likely that the majority of the observed pl strength actually comes from the @xmath140 process which is dominated by the @xmath106 triplet line .",
    "this is the lowest energy triplet state and has a weak pl strength for a recombination process which leaves the final electron in the lowest landau level thus suggesting that there will be a large population to undergo recombination via a shakeup process",
    ".    figures 5(a ) and ( b ) show the @xmath140 and @xmath141 lines respectively for the case of an intermediate in - plane confinement with rod length @xmath48 . again",
    "the non - shakeup lines are included for comparison . in both fig.5(a ) and ( b ) the pl strengths of the @xmath136 lines are significantly lower than the non - shakeup spectrum . first we consider the @xmath140 lines in fig.5(a ) . the overall @xmath136 spectrum is weaker than for the case of weak confinement ( cf .",
    "fig.4(a ) ) .",
    "the triplet @xmath136 lines dominate over the singlet lines and there is no longer a linear drop of pl energy with increasing b - field .",
    "also the splitting between the shakeup @xmath0 lines and the non - shakeup @xmath0 lines does not change linearly with b. this is due to the confinement which prevents @xmath146 from varying linearly with b. the competition between confinement and b - field was important in the non - shakeup processes of sec .",
    "[ pl ] , spreading the pl energies of the lines and affecting their strengths .",
    "here we also see an effect on the pl energies of the @xmath140 lines . at low b - field , where the confinement dominates ,",
    "the triplet @xmath147 pl lines are separated , the @xmath148 state having the lowest pl energy then @xmath149 and finally @xmath103 with the highest energy .",
    "the energy separation is due to the confinement which raises the energy of the @xmath150 final electron state thus lowering the pl energy .",
    "this effect is removed as landau levels form with higher b - field ( b@xmath1516.5 t ) .",
    "the m=0 triplet @xmath136 line always appears at higher energy because its initial state is higher in energy .",
    "we now consider the @xmath141 processes of fig.5(b ) .",
    "the singlet spectrum clearly dominates the overall shakeup spectrum .",
    "it decreases linearly with increasing b and its intensity decreases with b also .",
    "the energy of the singlet @xmath141 line is higher than the @xmath140 lines of fig.5(a ) .",
    "finally we notice that the high pl strength of the triplet @xmath141 line at b=2 t is large , being in fact only ten times weaker than the non - shakeup lines .",
    "this occurs because the dominant effect of the confinement at low b - field is to force the @xmath152 states to have similar energies , thereby causing the m=1 triplet charged exciton to configure itself more like the m@xmath110 charged excitons and luminesce accordingly .",
    "figures 6(a ) and ( b ) show the @xmath140 and @xmath141 spectra respectively for the case of strong in - plane confinement , with a rod length l@xmath153 . again",
    "the non - shakeup spectra are shown for comparison .",
    "considering the @xmath140 processes in fig.6(a ) , we see that the triplet lines dominate the singlet lines .",
    "the triplet spectrum is clearly split into four sets each corresponding to a shakeup process from a charged exciton with a given @xmath70 .",
    "the @xmath148 has the lowest su energy followed by @xmath149 and finally @xmath103 .",
    "this separation is due to the strong confinement ( as in the low field regime of fig.5(a ) ) which raises the energy of the @xmath154 final state electron thus lowering the pl energy .",
    "as b increases , the @xmath154 states start to converge in energy to form the landau level ; the spacing between the lines is consequently reduced .",
    "the @xmath140 lines are very weak in this strong confinement limit .",
    "this is because the strong confinement forces the charged exciton to have very little contribution from the @xmath155 states which now have much higher single particle energies .    the @xmath141 lines of fig.6(b ) are much higher in pl energy than those of fig.6(a ) .",
    "the singlet line decreases linearly with b having a gradient of about 1mev / t .",
    "the triplet line is not linear , and for low fields is close to the non - shakeup spectrum in both energy and pl strength . as in the case of intermediate confinement at low b ,",
    "this is due to the similarity in energy of @xmath152 states , thereby causing the @xmath156 triplet charged exciton to configure itself in a similar manner to the @xmath106 state and luminesce accordingly .",
    "we notice this effect dies away with increasing b. however , it clearly persists to higher b than in the case of intermediate confinement .    from figs 4,5 and 6 we see that the @xmath140 spectra become increasingly disimilar from the @xmath141 spectra as the in - plane confinement",
    "is increased .",
    "this occurs because the degeneracy of the landau levels is lost as the confinement is increased .",
    "the single particle states instead form themselves into harmonic oscillator levels .",
    "thus for all confinements the @xmath140 processes leave the final electron in an excited state , whereas in the @xmath141 processes , the final state electron is increasingly in the lowest m=1 oscillator state .",
    "as such the @xmath141 process is more like a normal recombination process than a shakeup process .",
    "our exact diagonalization of the charged exciton hamiltonian gives us the full expansion coefficients for the various charged exciton wavefunctions .",
    "we can use these to investigate the structure of the charged exciton states .",
    "in particular , we are interested in how the electrons are correlated with the valence hole .",
    "this is conveniently visualized using the electron - hole pair distribution function , @xmath157  @xcite :    @xmath158    where @xmath159 thus @xmath157 can be interpreted as the electron density relative to the hole and @xmath160 as the probability of finding an electron at @xmath161 and a hole at @xmath162 .",
    "@xmath160 is written in terms of our previous singlet and triplet wavefunction expansion coefficients ( @xmath163 and @xmath164 ) as follows :",
    "@xmath165    where s takes the positive sign , t takes the negative sign and @xmath166 and @xmath167 are given by : @xmath168    the pair distribution functions are radially symmetric so we are able to plot the radial pair distribution function ( rpdf ) given by @xmath169 .",
    "fig.7 shows how these rpdfs are used to determine the structure of the charged exciton . if both electrons are equally correlated with the hole ( fig.7(a ) ) then we expect @xmath170 to have a single peak as in fig.7(b ) .",
    "if however one of the electrons is closer to the hole than the other , as in fig.7(c ) , then we expect to see two peaks corresponding to the inner and outer electron rings as in fig.7(d ) .",
    "charged excitons with this doubly peaked rpdf have a structure which is more like an exciton with an orbiting outer electron ( @xmath171 )    we now examine in more detail the electron - hole radial pair distribution functions for a charged exciton with rod length l@xmath153 . figure 8 shows how the electron - hole rpdf for the lowest energy singlet state ( m=0 ) with a weak in - plane confinement varies with b - field .",
    "as b increases the electrons become more closely correlated with the hole .",
    "as is generally the case , the overall form of the functions does nt change ; instead they just scale with the characteristic length @xmath117 . in the case of weak confinement , this length is dominated by the magnetic length giving rise to a strong scaling with b. for stronger confinements the characteristic length becomes more dependent on the confining potential , thereby reducing the effects of changing b - field on the distribution functions .",
    "figures 9 and 10 demonstrate how the electron - hole rpdfs of the lowest energy singlet and triplet states for various @xmath70 depend on the confining potential .",
    "figures 9(a ) and ( b ) are for weak in - plane confinement , at b=10 t , with singlet and triplet charged excitons shown respectively .",
    "figure 9(a ) exhibits two different types of curve .",
    "the @xmath172 curves are fairly narrow curves peaked at around 100   indicating that both electrons are equally close to the hole .",
    "the @xmath1730 curves are broader , peaking at between 200 and 300 .",
    "the @xmath174 curve even shows a shoulder at higher electron - hole separation indicating an @xmath171 structure .",
    "figure 9(b ) shows the corresponding triplet curves .",
    "again there are two types of curve .",
    "the triplet @xmath175 electron - hole pair distributions are narrow and peaked at about 150 , whereas the @xmath176 curves are much broader .",
    "as @xmath70 increases from 0 to 3 a distinct shoulder develops at higher electron - hole separation indicating the @xmath171 structure . in general , the triplet curves broaden more quickly than the singlet curves with increasing @xmath70 . of particular interest is the @xmath103 triplet electron - hole rpdf .",
    "this shows a broadening that the corresponding singlet curve does not .",
    "the reason for this arises from the symmetries of the wavefunctions .",
    "the singlet charged exciton has electrons which are symmetric under interchange of their spatial wavefunctions .",
    "thus the @xmath103 singlet charged exciton can have both electrons and the hole with the same angular momentum @xmath177 .",
    "this gives rise to the sharply peaked singlet @xmath103 curve in fig.9(b ) .",
    "the triplet charged exciton however has a spatial wavefunction which is antisymmetric under electron interchange .",
    "this implies that the lowest energy @xmath103 triplet state can not be built with both electrons and the hole in states with @xmath177 .",
    "instead the state will have one electron with @xmath178 , the other with @xmath179 and the hole with @xmath180 .",
    "a state with @xmath181 would force the electron with @xmath178 to change to a state of higher @xmath112 , thus placing it in a higher landau level ; this is energetically unfavourable .",
    "a state with @xmath182 would force the hole into a higher @xmath27 state than either electron ; the electrons would hence come closer in @xmath23 .",
    "this situation is clearly electrostatically unfavourable given the relation between @xmath27 and @xmath183 provided by eqn .",
    "[ < r^2 > ] .",
    "thus from symmetry and energy considerations , the lowest energy @xmath103 triplet charged exciton should have one electron closer to the hole than the other .",
    "this gives rise to the broad electron - hole rpdf seen in fig.9(b ) .",
    "it also partially explains the fact that the triplet ground state has angular momentum @xmath106 , whereas the singlet ground state has @xmath103 .",
    "the electron - hole rpdfs at b=10 t in the case of strong confinement are shown in fig.10 .",
    "as with fig.9 , only the lowest energy states at each m are considered .",
    "figure 10(a ) shows the electron - hole rpdf for the singlet charged exciton .",
    "the @xmath103 case is still the most sharply peaked .",
    "the other rpdfs all have similar peak heights and widths .",
    "this is a direct result of the strong confinement which lifts the degeneracy of the landau levels instead giving instead single particle states corresponding to a harmonic oscillator .",
    "now the degeneracy is between single particle states with the same @xmath27 .",
    "this forces the @xmath150 charged exciton states to behave very like those with @xmath184 .",
    "this can be seen in the rpdfs of fig.10(a ) where the @xmath106 curve resembles the @xmath185 curve etc . comparing figs.10(a ) and",
    "9(a ) we see that the distribution functions peak at similar electron - hole separations in both cases .",
    "the high confinement is conspicuous however in removing the shoulders corresponding to high electron - hole separation from the distribution functions ; consequently all these lowest energy states have both their electrons equally well correlated with the hole .",
    "figure 10(b ) shows the corresponding electron - hole rpdfs for the triplet charged excitons .",
    "this shows strong similarities with the singlet case .",
    "the main distinction is the sharply peaked triplet @xmath106 rpdf which is narrower than the others .",
    "this corresponds to the @xmath103 rpdf in the singlet case ( fig.10(a ) ) .",
    "it comes as no surprise therefore that the @xmath103 state is the lowest energy singlet state whilst the lowest energy triplet state has @xmath106 . as in the weakly confined case",
    "this difference in the angular momenta of the lowest energy singlet and triplet states is due to the symmetries of the singlet and triplet spatial wavefunctions under electron interchange .",
    "again we see the triplet states showing evidence of underlying oscillator single particle states since the @xmath184 and @xmath150 states have become very similar .    the electron - hole rpdfs for an intermediate in - plane confinement behave as the strong or weak confinement cases depending whether the b - field or the confinement is dominant .",
    "earlier we saw that the cross - over between the dominance of the confinement or the b - field occurs at about b=6.5 t for this intermediate confinement .",
    "below b=6.5 t the electron - hole rpdfs are similar to those in fig.10 . above b=6.5 t",
    "the electron - hole rpdfs are similar to those in fig.9 .",
    "we now turn to the excited states . as an illustration we look at the excited states with the same @xmath70 as the lowest energy singlet ( @xmath103 ) and triplet ( @xmath106 ) charged excitons .",
    "the electron - hole rpdfs for the first five states of these systems are shown in figs.11(a ) and ( b ) .",
    "a charged exciton can become excited in essentially two different ways .",
    "first it can start to ionize itself by moving the second electron increasingly further away from the electron and hole which are left in the centre .",
    "second it can keep both electrons equally close to the hole , but alter their correlations with the hole . in the first case",
    "we should see two peaks forming in the electron - hole distribution function .",
    "in the second the distribution function should have a single peak , but the behaviour near the origin and the peak position should be modified . with this in mind",
    "we consider fig.11 .",
    "first we consider the singlet case ( fig.11(a ) ) .",
    "the lowest four energy states clearly show the electron - hole rpdf becoming broader as the energy increases , until eventually at level 4 there is a definite high electron - hole separation shoulder indicating a partial separation into @xmath171 .",
    "the next energy level up sees both electrons equally correlated with the hole , the rpdf vanishing more quickly at the origin and its peak position having moved to higher separations .",
    "this corresponds to the second type of excitation .",
    "the triplet energy levels at @xmath106 ( fig.11(b ) ) show a very similar behaviour .",
    "the electron - hole rpdfs broaden as the energy level is increased",
    ". a higher separation shoulder can be just distinguished in the rpdf for level 5 .",
    "similar effects are seen in the excited states at different m and different confinements .",
    "the clearest case for showing the two types of excitation process is a strongly confined charged exciton with @xmath1862 at b=10 t .",
    "this is shown in fig.12 . here",
    "the first three levels show broad electron - hole rpdfs .",
    "level 4 has two distinct peaks in its rpdf arising from two different electron rings around the hole .",
    "level 5 then has an electron - hole rpdf which has one peak moved to slightly higher e - h separation , and clearly has a different behaviour at the origin .",
    "this suggests that the process of excitation for a charged exciton at fixed angular momentum @xmath70 involves repetition of the two - step process corresponding to figs.7(b ) and 7(d ) .",
    "each cycle pushes the peaks to higher r and forces the rpdf to vanish more quickly at the origin .",
    "to summarize , we have studied a negatively charged exciton in a uniform b - field by means of numerical diagonalization .",
    "we have discussed our results in terms of the pl spectra for various in - plane confinements and experimentally relevant b - fields .",
    "the pl spectra were calculated considering recombination from a range of initial angular momentum states of the charged exciton ( @xmath187 ) .",
    "a realistic form factor consistent with 200300 quantum wells has been used to modify the interactions .",
    "we found that our weak in - plane confinement results agree very closely with published experimental spectra for high mobility quantum wells ( ref .",
    "we also get good agreement with the pl energies and intensities of published shakeup lines in the pl spectra ( ref .",
    "these results demonstrate that the expected pl signatures of charged excitons are not qualitatively affected by the presence of a range of initial angular momentum states .",
    "the one exception to this is the triplet line which appears at finite b - field .",
    "this is due to the @xmath103 triplet charged exciton which must be present for the line to be observed .",
    "we also discussed the pl spectra ( including shakeup lines ) for the cases of intermediate and strong in - plane confinements .",
    "these represent predictions of the expected pl spectra from charged excitons in quantum dots . our calculated spectra show interesting structure which should be observable and we hope this will stimulate further experimental study on such systems . finally , we calculated various electron - hole radial pair distribution functions for the charged excitons .",
    "these allowed us to examine in detail the structure of the charged exciton states as a function of angular momentum , b - field and in - plane confinement .",
    "the excited states of the charged exciton were also studied .",
    "we found that excitation occurs via two methods .",
    "first the charged exciton can undergo partial ionization whereby one of the electrons moves away from the hole leaving a configuration of an exciton orbited by an outer electron .",
    "second , both electrons remain equally close to the hole , but their correlations with it change .",
    "the combination of these two processes provides insight into the excitation mechanism for charged excitons at a given angular momentum .",
