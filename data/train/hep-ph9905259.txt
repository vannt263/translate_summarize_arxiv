    "we have recently made reanalyses of @xmath13 and @xmath14 phase shifts and found strong evidences for existence of @xmath15 @xmath6 meson and @xmath16 @xmath17 meson , respectively , which had been sought but missing for a long time . for detailed analyses ,",

    "are determined with the values ( in mev ) , @xmath18",
    "now we have scalars below 1 gev , @xmath2 and @xmath5 with @xmath15 , @xmath3 with @xmath16 and @xmath4 with @xmath19 . among these scalar mesons , experimentally , @xmath5 has a considerably small @xmath13-width regardless of its large phase volume , while having a rather large @xmath20-width in spite of the fact that its mass is quite close to the @xmath20-threshold . assuming approximate validity of the ozi rule , this fact seems to suggest that @xmath5 consists of almost pure @xmath21-component . here",
    "we simply assume that @xmath6(600 ) and @xmath5 are the ideal mixing@xcite states of a single scalar nonet and that the squared - mass matrix takes a diagonal form in these ideal bases .",
    "the ideal - mixing states are related to the octet state @xmath22 and the singlet state @xmath23 through the orthogonal transformation : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the matrix of the orthogonal transformation , whose elements are given by @xmath26 and @xmath27 . through the transformation @xmath25 ,",
    "the elements of the squared - mass matrix in the octet - singlet bases are numerically given by @xmath28 where the numerical values are given in ( gev)@xmath29 , and we have used the experimental values @xmath30=0.59 gev and @xmath31=0.98 gev . is smaller than @xmath32 is in contrast with the case of pseudoscalar @xmath33-@xmath34 mass splitting .",
    "this fact reflects the property of the @xmath35-breaking interaction ( see , ",

    "note that the famous nonet mass formula@xcite of the vector mesons , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , is valid in the case @xmath38 . ] the mass @xmath32 can also be determined theoretically by using the gell - mann okubo ( gmo ) relation , @xmath39 where we have used the experimental values @xmath40=0.91 gev and @xmath41=0.98 gev .",
    "this value of @xmath42 is quite close to @xmath32=0.87 gev , obtained phenomenologically in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mm ] ) .",
    "this fact supports our classification that @xmath43*(600 ) , * @xmath44*(980 ) , * @xmath45*(900 ) and * @xmath46 * form a single scalar nonet.*@xcite",
    "= 7.0 cm    we assume that our scalar @xmath6-nonet is a composite @xmath47-system as a chiral partner of the pseudoscalar @xmath48-nonet and that in the low energy region , where the structure of composite mesons can be neglected , they can @xmath49 be described by the linear @xmath6 model ( l@xmath6 m ) . in the matrix notation @xmath50 ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 denoting the scalar and pseudoscalar meson nonet , respectively ) , the lagrangian of @xmath7l@xmath6m@xcite is @xmath53 where @xmath54 represents the trace . here",
    "@xmath55 is proportional to the current - quark mass matrix in qcd and the form @xmath56 guarantees the pcac . in the process of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , @xmath57 acquires the vacuum expectation value @xmath58 , and @xmath59-couplings appear .",
    "the pseudoscalar decay constants @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and their ratio are represented by @xmath62 the six model parameters contained in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lsm3 ] ) are determined by the masses of @xmath63 , @xmath6 and @xmath17 , and the decay constant @xmath60 , and thus we can predict the masses and widths of the scalar mesons .",
    "these are given in table [ tab : tree ] .",
    "the predicted properties are very sensitive to the value of @xmath64,@xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tree].@xcite the deviation of the value of @xmath64 from 1 represents the degree of @xmath7 breaking by @xmath65 , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : fp ] ) .",
    "we prefer the region in which this ratio satisfies @xmath66 ( which is somewhat larger than the experimental value 1.22 ) indicated by the two vertical lines in the figure , where the value @xmath67 reproduces the experimental value within its uncertainty . in this region ,",
    "@xmath68 and @xmath69 are obtained with much larger values than those of @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the reason that @xmath72 , in spite of its comparatively smaller phase space , becomes as large as @xmath73 is due to the contribution to the coupling constant @xmath74 from the determinant - type interaction in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lsm3 ] ) .",
    "the predicted widths of @xmath6 and @xmath17 are consistent with the experimental values .",
    "the predicted masses and widths of the other members , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , are close to those of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    ".the properties of the scalar meson nonet predicted by @xmath7l@xmath6 m , compared with experiments .",
    "the underlined values of @xmath30 and @xmath40 along with @xmath60 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are used as inputs .",
    "the region of the value of @xmath80 corresponds to the region in which the ratio of the decay constants satisfies @xmath81 .",
    "the properties of @xmath82 and @xmath83 become close to those of the observed resonances @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , taken as the experimental candidates .",
    "the quantity @xmath84 is the partial width @xmath85 .",
    "the value of @xmath86 is highly dependent on @xmath87 , since @xmath87 is close to @xmath20-threshold . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : tree ]    the @xmath83 and @xmath82 states have large @xmath20-coupling constants .",
    "mev , @xmath88 and @xmath89 mev , for @xmath83 , @xmath90 .",
    "+ for @xmath82 , @xmath91 ( especially the @xmath83 strongly couples to the @xmath20 channel . )",
    "this suggests that these states may also be interpreted as @xmath20-molecule states.@xcite + in l@xmath6 m , @xmath92 and @xmath93 have almost the same quark content .",
    "despite this fact , @xmath94 becomes much larger than @xmath30 .",
    "this phenomenon is explained by the properties of the instanton - induced @xmath35-breaking determinant - type interaction .",
    "+ thus , it is promising to regard @xmath43*(600 ) * , @xmath45*(900 ) * , * a*@xmath95*(980 ) * , * and * * f*@xmath95*(980 ) * * as members of the scalar nonet , forming with the members of * @xmath96 * -nonet a linear representation of the su(3 ) chiral symmetry*.",
    "in our phase shift analyses of the @xmath15 @xmath13 system the @xmath97 of hard core type introduced phenomenologically played an essential role .",
    "the strong cancellation between the positive @xmath98 due to @xmath6-resonance and the negative @xmath8 leads to the existence of @xmath6 meson . in the @xmath99 @xmath13 system , where there is no known / expected resonance , the phase shift of repulsive core type appears directly.@xcite + the origin of this @xmath97 seems to have a close connection to the @xmath10-interaction in l@xmath6m@xcite : it represents a contact zero - range interaction and is strongly repulsive both in the @xmath15 and 2 systems , and has plausible properties as the origin of repulsive core .",
    "+ the @xmath13-scattering @xmath100-amplitude by @xmath101 l@xmath6 m consists of the amplitude due to @xmath6-production , which is strongly attractive , and the amplitude due to contact @xmath10 interaction , which is strongly repulsive .",
    "these two terms cancel each other in @xmath102 level , and the @xmath103 tomozawa - weinberg amplitude and the @xmath104 ( and higher order ) correction term are left . as a result the derivative coupling property of @xmath48-meson as a nambu - goldstone boson is preserved . in this sense",
    "the @xmath10-interaction can be called a  compensating \" interaction for @xmath6-effect . +",
    "thus the strong cancellation between the positive @xmath98 and the negative @xmath97 in our analysis is reducible to this cancellation in @xmath100 amplitude guaranteed by chiral symmetry .",
    "scattering amplitude , leading to existence of @xmath17 resonance , and the origin of @xmath8 in @xmath16 channel is explained by the compensating repulsive interaction . ] + we can directly estimate the magnitude of @xmath8 in the framework of l@xmath6 m by using n / d method .",
    "the behavior of @xmath8 is almost consistent with the theoretical prediction by the l@xmath6 m including @xmath105 meson contribution.@xcite",
    "in this talk first i have pointed out that the scalars below 1 gev , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are possibly to form a single scalar nonet@xcite : the octet members of this nonet satisfies the gell - mann okubo mass formula .",
    "the masses and widths of the scalar @xmath6-nonet are also shown to satisfy the relation predicted by @xmath7 l@xmath6 m .",
    "this fact suggests the linear representation of @xmath7 chiral symmetry is realized in nature .",
    "+ secondly i have reported on the recent results concerning the background phase shift @xmath8 : in our phase shift analysis there occurs a strong cancellation between @xmath98 due to the @xmath6 resonance and @xmath8 , which is guaranteed by chiral symmetry .",
    "a reason of overlooking the @xmath6 in conventional phase shift analysis seems to be due to overlooking of this cancellation mechanism .",
    "the phenomenological behavior of @xmath8 is quantitatively describable in the framework of l@xmath6 m including @xmath105 meson contribution .",
    "finally i add some comments on the related works .",
    "the authors in ref.@xcite have insisted that the above - mentioned scalar @xmath6-nonet is to be @xmath106 states , being based on the results of their analysis ; the @xmath107 widths of @xmath108 and @xmath109 , assuming them to be @xmath110 @xmath47 states , are much smaller than the theoretical predictions , obtained by using the @xmath47 model , from the corresponding widths of @xmath111 and @xmath112 , the established @xmath113 @xmath47 states , respectively , however , the @xmath6-nonet is to be discriminated from the conventional @xmath110 @xmath47 state , and is to be regarded as a relativistic ( positive parity ) `` @xmath114-wave '' @xmath47 state from the viewpoint of linear representation of chiral symmetry.@xcite actually , the l@xmath6 m prediction for the @xmath115 decay rates of the @xmath108 , @xmath109 mesons is shown to agree with experimental data.@xcite +    999 s. ishida _",
