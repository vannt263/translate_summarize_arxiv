    "therefore , putting the vertex reconstruction efficiency equal to 10% , we can expect the observation of about @xmath133 events per year .",
    "however , the situation is less optimistic for the detection of cp - eigenstates of @xmath11 .",
    "indeed , the cp - even mode with the @xmath134 or @xmath135 final states covers only a @xmath136 fraction of @xmath11 decays , which makes the observation unreachable .",
    "the cp - odd events with @xmath137 can be detected with the branching fraction about @xmath138 , which downs the rate to 1 event per year .",
    "thus , the reconstruction of reference triangle after 10 years of data taking would give , at least , the 30% accuracy for the characteristic triangle side , which makes the extraction of angle @xmath0 rather academic exercise in the method offered .",
