    "our interest in the gaffnian state is as a likely example of gapless matter with some remnant of topological physics , even though precisely what `` topological '' means in a gapless state is difficult to define . unlike the @xmath0 state  @xcite in which there has recently been a resurgence of interest , the gaffnian does not currently have an interpretation as a metal of composite fermions .",

    "( b ) can be proved by showing the wavefunction does not vanish at @xmath64 , i.e. , the wavefunction does not vanish even after clustering all the pairs .",
    "because of the first term in the rhs of eq .",
