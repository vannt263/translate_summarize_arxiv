    "emulsions are suspensions of droplets of one immiscible fluid in another .",
    "they are widely used in technological applications requiring the transport and flow of the dispersed fluid ; these include oil recovery , food products , pharmacology , coatings , and cosmetics .",
    "the droplets are typically stabilized by a surfactant adsorbed on their interfaces ; this ensures that there is a short - range repulsive interaction between them , which prevents their coalescence .",
    "such a repulsive emulsion becomes a disordered elastic solid as it is compressed : this behavior can be characterized by the complex shear modulus , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the storage modulus , @xmath3 is the loss modulus , and @xmath4 is the angular frequency . for droplet volume fractions , @xmath5 , approaching random close packing of spheres , @xmath6 , from below , a repulsive emulsion exhibits a weak elasticity that arises from thermal fluctuations @xcite .",
    "by contrast , if @xmath5 is increased above @xmath0 , the droplets are forced to deform ; as a result , the elasticity is determined by the laplace pressure scale of the droplets , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the interfacial tension between the dispersed and continuous phases and @xmath9 is the average droplet size @xcite .",
    "even though it is an elastic solid , such an emulsion can nevertheless be made to flow quite easily : the imposition of sufficiently large shear causes it to yield .",
    "this behavior can be elucidated using oscillatory measurements of @xmath2 and @xmath3 performed at constant @xmath4 and varying maximum strain amplitude @xmath10 .",
    "the viscoelastic moduli of a repulsive emulsion above @xmath0 become strain - dependent for sufficiently large @xmath10 as the emulsion yields . for increasing @xmath10 , the nonlinear",
    "@xmath3 exhibits a single , well - defined peak at a strain @xmath11 before falling as @xmath12 ; @xmath2 concomitantly decreases as @xmath13 with @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the pronounced peak in @xmath3 is a characteristic feature of soft glassy materials ; it is a direct consequence of a structural relaxation process and thus provides an effective way to characterize yielding @xcite .",
    "this approach is particularly useful for repulsive emulsions above @xmath0 , for which the peak in @xmath3 reflects the irreversible rearrangements of the densely - packed droplets @xcite .",
    "another widely - encountered class of emulsions is characterized by droplets with additional attractive interactions between them . in stark contrast to the repulsive case",
    ", such an attractive emulsion can form an elastic solid even for @xmath5 well below @xmath0 @xcite ; the bonds between droplets result in a connected network of aggregates that can support a shear stress @xcite . as a result ,",
    "an attractive emulsion must exhibit different flow and yielding behavior @xcite . however , despite its broad industrial applications , exactly how this behavior occurs is unknown .",
    "thus , measurements of the characteristic @xmath10-dependent yielding of attractive emulsions are essential to elucidate how emulsion rheology depends on interdroplet interactions .    in this article",
    ", we explore the rheology of attractive emulsions using oscillatory measurements over a range of @xmath5 .",

    "our results provide insight into the elasticity and yielding of attractive emulsions and highlight the sensitivity of emulsion rheology to attractive interactions .",
    "we use emulsions comprised of silicone oil droplets dispersed in formamide , a solvent with negligible evaporation ; the droplets are sterically stabilized by pluronic p105 , a non - ionic amphiphilic copolymer @xcite .",
    "the mechanical measurements are performed at @xmath21c on strain- or stress - controlled rheometers ( ta ares g2 or anton paar physica mcr 501 , respectively ) using a parallel - plate geometry .",
    "the sample environment is controlled using a solvent trap .",
    "the plates are roughened to eliminate wall - slip , and we verify that measurements are independent of the gap size ; furthermore , the results are similar to those obtained using a cone - and - plate geometry , indicating that they are not significantly influenced by the non - uniform strain field characteristic of a parallel - plate geometry .",
    "we pre - shear the samples prior to each measurement by imposing a 50s@xmath22 constant shear - rate flow for 30s , followed by oscillatory shear of @xmath10 decreasing from 300% to 0.01% over a period of 230s .",
    "we do not observe sample creaming over the measurement duration .",
    "at the temperature and concentrations used here , p105 forms freely - dispersed globular micelles in formamide with radius @xmath23 nm , aggregation number @xmath24 and critical micelle concentration @xmath25 mm @xcite . these micelles induce attractive depletion interactions between emulsion droplets @xcite , whose magnitude at interdroplet contact @xmath26 we calculate using the vrij model @xcite : @xmath27 , where @xmath9 is the average droplet radius , @xmath28 is the p105 concentration , @xmath29 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath30 is temperature , and @xmath31 is avogadro s number . these interactions",
