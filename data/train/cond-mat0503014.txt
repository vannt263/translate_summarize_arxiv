    "the existence of limit cycles in the renormalization group ( rg ) is a possibility considered long ago by wilson in the framework of high energy physics  @xcite , but only recently has it found a concrete realization in several models in nuclear physics @xcite , quantum field theory @xcite , quantum mechanics @xcite , superconductivity @xcite , s - matrix models @xcite , bose - einstein condensation @xcite , effective low energy qcd @xcite , few body systems and efimov states @xcite , etc ( for a review of see @xcite . )",
    "the subject of duality cascades in supersymmetric gauge theory @xcite is also suggestive of limit - cycle behavior .",
    "chaotic flows have also been recently considered @xcite .",
    "the concepts of discrete scale invariance and quantum groups with @xmath4 real are also closely related @xcite .",
    "a rg limit cycle means that the coupling constants of the model are invariant under a finite rg transformation .",
    "there are generically two types of rg limit cycles : infrared and ultraviolet . in the former",
    "the limit cycles appear in the rg flow towards low energy and imply peculiar scaling properties of the spectrum termed as russian doll scaling in @xcite for obvious reasons . in particular if there are bound states , their energies @xmath5 will scale as @xmath6 where @xmath1 is the `` time '' needed to complete an rg cycle .",
    "the ultraviolet rg limit cycles appear in the rg flow towards high energy and lead to log - periodic behavior of the scattering as a function of energy , and/or russian doll behavior in the masses of resonances @xmath7 if they are present .",
    "reference @xcite proposed a slight modification of the bcs model of superconductivity , referred to here as the rd model , whose rg analysis revealed the existence of infrared limit cycles .",
    "the standard bcs model is given by the sum of a kinetic hamiltonian describing the propagation of free electrons , plus a pairing hamiltonian describing the scattering of a pair of electrons occupying time reversed states , say @xmath8 and @xmath9 , into another pair of states , say @xmath10 and @xmath11 , with an amplitude @xmath12 @xcite . for @xmath13-wave pairing one can approximate the matrix element @xmath12 by a constant value @xmath14 for all the incoming @xmath15 and outgoing momenta @xmath16 within the debye shell around the fermi surface .",
    "to perform an rg analysis one defines a dimensionless bcs coupling constant @xmath17 with @xmath18 the energy density at the fermi level . then under the rg flow @xmath19 increases towards the ir becoming infinite at a scale signaling the formation of cooper pairs .",
    "the modification added in @xcite was to let the amplitude @xmath12 to pick up an extra imaginary piece proportional to @xmath20 where the sign depends on wether the outgoing pair has greater or lower energy than the incoming pair ( @xmath21 is a dimensionless coupling constant ) .",
    "this of course breaks the time reversal symmetry which is a characteristic feature of the rd model .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the coupling @xmath21 remains invariant under the rg flow while @xmath19 exhibits a cyclic behavior with an rg period given by @xmath22 . under this flow",
    "the coupling @xmath19 becomes infinite at a finite scale but its value can be continued through minus infinity until it reaches its original value after the rg period @xmath1 .",
    "one may expect from this behavior the existence of infinitely many scales related by @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , using the mean field bcs ansatz , which is valid for generic choices of the pair amplitudes @xmath12 , one can show that the gap equation admits infinitely many solutions characterized by the gaps @xmath23 , where the ground state corresponds to the solution with the highest value of the gap , @xmath24 , and the other solutions , @xmath25 , are high energy collective excited states .",
    "let us call the latter solutions of the bcs gap equation the `` superconduting dolls '' or simply `` dolls '' and the integer @xmath26 that label them the `` nesting number '' .",
    "the larger the nesting number , the larger is the size of the cooper pairs forming the collective state , which is given by the correlation length @xmath27 .",
    "these results showed in a simple case the intimate relationship between the cyclic properties of the rg flows and the spectrum of the theory , which were also confirmed numerically in the case of one cooper pair  @xcite .",
    "the case of more pairs was more difficult to deal with numerically .",
    "the dmrg or other ground state numerical methods were not helpful since one needs to explore high energy excited states to identify the `` dolls '' .",
    "fortunately the russian doll bcs model has been recently shown to be exactly solvable by dunning and links using the quantum inverse scattering method @xcite .",
    "this important result will enable us to explore in detail the spectrum of the rd model by solving the bethe ansatz equations ( bae ) .",
    "this is the aim of this paper , whose organization is as follows .    in section",
    "ii we generalize the definition of the rd model , as given in @xcite , showing that the manifold of solutions of the gap equation with russian doll scaling is a generic feature .",
    "in section iii we review the dunning and links exact solution and show its agreement in the large @xmath28 limit with the mean field solution obtained in section ii ( @xmath28 is the number of particles ) . in section iv we focus on the solution of the bae for the one cooper pair problem , which serves to clarify some conceptual and technical issues before considering the many body case . in section",
    "v we explore numerically and analytically the low energy spectrum of the model in the large @xmath28 limit , finding new types of elementary excitations which are absent in the standard bcs model .",
    "these new kinds of elementary excitations can be characterized by a quantum number @xmath2 which has a clear meaning in both the rg and in the exact bethe ansatz solution . in appendix",
    "a we review the analytic techniques used in section v and in appendix b we describe the elementary excitations of the standard bcs model in the canonical ensemble to facilitate the comparison with the excitations found in the rd model .",
    "the model defined in @xcite was based on a modification of the bcs model used to described the ultrasmall superconducting grains discovered by ralph , black and tinkham @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the latter model , also known as the picket - fence model in nuclear physics , has doubly degenerate discrete electronic energy levels which can be taken equally spaced or randomly distributed .",
    "it was claimed in @xcite that the results obtained for the equally spaced model are valid in more general circumstances .",
    "we shall show in this section that this is indeed the case by considering a version of the rd model that is more similar to the standard formulation of the bcs model .",
    "let us call @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) the destruction ( creation ) operator of an electron in the state with momenta @xmath16 and spin @xmath31 .",

    "since @xmath52 the hamiltonian is hermitian but the imaginary term breaks the time reversal symmetry . setting @xmath53 we recover the standard model used to describe @xmath54wave superconductors @xcite .",

    "we also expect a rd behaviour as long as time reversal is broken , @xmath94 , the reason being that the physics is dominated by the vicinity of the fermi surface in which case the simplified model ( [ a7 ] ) is a good approximation .",
    "this points towards the universality of the rd model , whose experimental realization seems a priori feasible .",
    "we shall next summarize the exact solution of the russian doll bcs model obtained by dunning and links @xcite .",
    "we will use the notation adapted to the study of ultrasmall superconducting grains , although the results are more general as we have shown in the previous section . for grains ,",
    "the single particle basis of momenta and spin is not appropriate due to the lack of translational invariance .",
    "however one can still use time reversed states @xmath95 created and destroyed by fermion operators @xmath96 and @xmath97 where @xmath98 labels @xmath28 discrete energy levels @xmath99 .",

    "is fixed to @xmath100 , i.e. @xmath101 , so that @xmath102 where @xmath103 is twice the debye energy @xmath104 . henceforth all the energies will be twice their standard values .",
    "let @xmath105 , @xmath106 denote the usual pair operators . using this notation",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ a1 ] ) becomes [ b1 ] h = _ j=1^n _ j   b^_j b_j   +   _ j , j = 1^n   v_jj b^_j b_j , where @xmath107 is the scattering potential .",
    "similarly to eq.([a7 ] ) , the rd model is defined by : [ b2 ] - v_jj = g + i sign ( _ j - _ j ) .    in ( [ b2 ] ) we are assuming that all the pair energies @xmath99 are different and labeled in increasing order , i.e. @xmath108 if @xmath109 .",
    "hence the second term in ( [ b2 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath110 so that ( [ b1 ] ) can be written as [ b3 ] h = _ j=1^n ( _ j - g )   b^_j b_j   -   |g _ j > k = 1^n   ( e^ i b^_j b_k + e^ - i b^_k b_j )    where = ( ) , |g = [ b4 ]    the hamiltonian ( [ b3 ] ) is basically the one studied in @xcite , where it was shown to be exactly solvable using the quantum inverse scattering method ( qism ) .",
    "these authors showed that ( [ b3 ] ) appears in the transfer matrix of a certain vertex model as the second order term in a series expansion in the inverse of the spectral parameter .",
    "the standard bcs model , which corresponds to the limit @xmath83 of the rd model , is also exactly solvable and integrable .",
    "its exact solution was obtained long ago by richardson @xcite and the integrals of motion found much later by cambiaggio , rivas and sarraceno @xcite ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "these results were rederived in the framework of the qism in terms of an inhomogeneous xxx vertex model with twisted boundary conditions @xcite . in this approach the hamiltonian and",
    "the conserved quantities appear in a semiclassical expansion of the transfer matrix in a parameter , @xmath111 , that enters in the xxx vertex @xmath112-matrix defining the model . expanding the @xmath112-matrix in this parameter , i.e. @xmath113 , yields the classical @xmath114-matrix which satisfies the classical yang - baxter equation , while the @xmath115-matrix satisfies the quantum yang - baxter equation .",
    "as we shall see below the latter parameter @xmath116 can be identified with the parameter @xmath55 of the russian doll bcs model .",

    "there is also a set of integers @xmath121 associated to the rapidity variables whose choice determines the ground state and the excitations .",
    "for example the ground state of the antiferromagnetic spin chains corresponds to increasing @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) , while holes in that distribution correspond to the elementary excitations of the model , i.e. the spinons @xcite .",
    "let us first show that the mean field solution of the russian doll bcs obtained in section ii coincides with the exact solution to leading order in @xmath28 .",
    "we first need to recall that the mean field solution of the bcs model agrees to leading order in @xmath28 with richardson s exact solution .",
    "this was proved by gaudin @xcite and richardson @xcite who solved equation ( [ b7 ] ) in the large @xmath28 limit using an electrostatic analogy ( see @xcite for the comparison between the analytical and numerical solutions , which is reviewed in the appendix a ) . in the gaudin and richardson",

    "the thermodynamic limit amounts to letting the number of levels @xmath28 go to infinity and the energy spacing @xmath57 go to zero while @xmath124 is kept constant .",

    "hence the exact solution , to leading order in @xmath28 , is given by the mean field solution with an effective value of the bcs coupling constant given by eq.([b11 ] ) .",
    "on the other hand this equation coincides with ( [ a17 ] ) , which shows that the mean field parameter @xmath2 , which labels the solutions of the gap equation , can be identified with the bethe numbers @xmath130 , common to all the roots @xmath131 , which classifies the solutions of the bae .",
