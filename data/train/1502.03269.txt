    "the abundance of massive clusters of galaxies is a sensitive probe of the normalization of density perturbations power spectrum and the universe geometry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in the observable universe there are about @xmath4 clusters with masses larger than @xmath5 .",
    "only a small fraction of these clusters is known today , but the situation will change drastically with forthcoming massive surveys in x - ray and microwave bands .",
    "main source of cluster candidates comes from x - ray ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , sz and optical surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "each approach has its own strengths and weaknesses .",
    "finding clusters in x - rays is a very powerful tool , capable of finding virialized cluster - scale objects at great distances .",
    "for example , in the upcoming srg / erosita all - sky survey , the most distant cluster will be at @xmath6 with the mass @xmath7 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this estimate assumes that one needs @xmath8 counts to detect and classify an object as an extended source and a cluster candidate .",
    "we argue below this limit in redshift comes primarily from the lack of massive halos at higher redshifts , rather then due to the dimming of x - ray signal with distance .",
    "therefore , with the upcoming srg / erosita data all massive clusters in the observable universe can be detected , no matter at what redshift they are .",
    "the same is of course true for sz - surveys ( e.g. , spt or act ) .    working with large number of candidates which are detected at the limit of srg / erosita sensitivity",
    "is a challenge and requires a massive optical followup program to measure redshifts . in many cases having even a crude estimate of the redshift for distant clusters",
    "would be very helpful .",
    "recent progress in sensitivity and angular resolution of sz facilities makes it possible to quickly detect clusters using the ground based instruments like carma or mustang ( exposures on the order of 20 minutes ) .",
    "however significant part of the new discovered clusters in x - ray and microwave surveys will overlap .",
    "we expect the discovery of many tens of thousands of such objects for which both x - ray and sz fluxes will be available",
    ". it will be very difficult task to find observing time on big telescopes to measure redshifts ( even photometric ) for all these objects .",
    "mentioned above possibility of the rough redshift and mass estimate using just raw x - ray and sz - data might permit to separate immediately clusters which need small , medium or big telescopes for much more precise redshift measurements .",
    "this will help a lot to plan optical follow up .",
    "situation obviously will be much easier on the regions of sky covered by extended optical redshift surveys like for example jpas .    already in 1970",
    "it was recognized that different dependencies of surface brightness of clusters in x - rays and microwave bands on the gas density @xmath9 , temperature @xmath10 and the physical size of the cluster @xmath11 , namely , @xmath12 ( for x - rays ) and @xmath13 ( for microwave band ) , can be used to determine @xmath11 independently of its redshift .",
    "it was assumed that x - ray data provide us with the value of @xmath10 .",
    "it is possible to compare x - ray and cmb fluxes from clusters of galaxies and come to the same conclusion .",
    "knowing @xmath11 and the angular size of the cluster in x - rays or in microwave band it is possible to estimate the distance to the cluster .",
    "this permits to measure the hubble constant for any individual cluster if its redshift is known .",
    "more than 1000 counts are needed to measure the gas temperature in clusters using observatories like chandra or xmm - newton .",
    "nustar spacecraft , hard x - ray grazing incidence telescopes aboard of astro - h and srg / art - xc will open a way to measure electron temperature in most massive selected clusters with @xmath14 kev .",
    "this will give an additional information about evolution of the hot gas temperatures inside clusters of galaxies as function of the redshift and will permit to take into account the relativistic corrections to sz effect .",
    "however for faint objects the required exposure is long and the information on gas temperature will not be available for majority of objects in the srg / erosita survey .",
    "cosmological evolution of cluster properties with redshift and scaling relations found for real clusters add another aspect to the problem .",
    "in particular , for clusters obeying observed scaling relations ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : raw ] ) the x - ray flux ( similarly to sz signal ) levels off at @xmath15 and this minimal level of x - ray flux can be used as a crude proxy to the mass of distance clusters . at the same time",
    "the ratio of the x - ray and sz fluxes turns out to be weakly dependent on the mass ( see and  [ sec : plane ] ) and can serve as a crude proxy to the redshift .",
    "while these proxies suffer from the large intrinsic scatter of cluster parameters , they might nevertheless be useful for srg / erosita , spt , act , which are planning to detect more than 100 000 clusters on the whole sky .",
    "for these numerous ( and mostly faint ) objects a combination of x - ray and sz fluxes will provide a simple and convenient tool to approximately position clusters in the mass - redshift diagram .",
    "this approach is similar to color - magnitude diagrams extensively used in infrared and optical astronomy .    for the purposes of this paper the relevant mass range is @xmath16 ; the relevant redshift range is @xmath17 .    throughout the paper",
    "we adopt the following cosmological parameters : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "these parameters are close to values derived / used in @xcite from the analysis of x - ray selected clusters at @xmath26 .",
    "the choice of this particular set is motivated by the use of the cluster scaling relations based on the same data .",
    "the total x - ray flux ( in @xmath27 in a given energy band from @xmath28 to @xmath29 kev ) from a galaxy cluster at redshift @xmath30 can be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the physical size of the cluster , @xmath9 is the electron density , @xmath33 is the gas temperature , @xmath34 is the luminosity distance to the cluster .",
    "a factor @xmath35 is the conversion coefficient from the rest frame flux into observer frame for a given @xmath33 and @xmath30 : @xmath36 where @xmath37 in units of @xmath38 is the emissivity at energy @xmath39 of an optically thin plasma with unit electron density . for hot clusters ( @xmath40 kev )",
    "the emissivity is largely due to thermal bremsstrahlung . in the arguments below we use the expression @xmath41 which corresponds to the thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum for @xmath42 .",
    "we note , however , that this expression is not accurate .",
    "first of all , with account for the gaunt - factor the bremsstrahlung spectrum ( in the relevant temperature and energy ranges ) is better described by the expression @xmath43 .",
    "secondly , the contribution of heavy elements ( lines and recombination continuum ) is important .",
    "therefore for all plots the realistic approximation of @xmath37 is used , calculated for apec model @xcite in xspec @xcite .",
    "the main difference of these more accurate approximations compared to eq.[eq : b_simple ] is a much weaker temperature dependence of the emissivity in the soft x - ray band .",
    "nevertheless , for the sake of simplicity of argument we use below eq.[eq : b_simple ] . with this definition @xmath44 .",
    "the total @xmath45 parameter for the same cluster is @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the thomson cross section , and @xmath48 is the angular diameter distance .",
    "if @xmath9 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are fixed , then the changes of the @xmath49 and @xmath50 are primarily driven by the factors @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively ( fig.[fig : raw ] , left panel ) . as expected , the x - ray flux declines much faster than the sz signal .",
    "indeed , the ratio of x - ray and sz signals changes with @xmath30 as @xmath53 however , the situation changes if instead of fixing all parameters , we fix only the mass of a cluster and let the the other properties to vary with redshift according to the cosmological scaling relations . in the simplest scenario of a self - similar growth of halos the characteristics of a virialized object , collapsing at redshift @xmath30 obey the following scaling relations : @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where @xmath57 .",
    "obviously , at a fixed mass the cluster collapsing at larger @xmath30 is expected to be hotter , denser and more compact , boosting the x - ray luminosity of the cluster .",
    "this boost in luminosity largely compensate for the @xmath58 factor in @xmath49 .",
    "indeed , @xmath59 at @xmath60 , @xmath61 and then declines as @xmath62 , @xmath63 approximately scales as @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "therefore @xmath66 the redshift dependence of the @xmath49 curve changes dramatically ( fig.[fig : raw ] , right panel ) , the steep decline is reverted and overall behavior at @xmath67 resembles that of @xmath50 . in other words",
    "if a cluster can be detected in x - ray survey at @xmath15 , than objects with similar mass _ can be detected at any redshift _ , assuming that the self - similar cluster evolution model is valid for extreme masses and very high redshifts .",
    "this implies that with a sufficient sensitivity both sz and x - ray surveys have access to all massive clusters at all redshifts in the observable universe , even at redshifts where massive clusters are not expected to exist .    in terms of the ratio of @xmath49 and @xmath50 at @xmath67 @xmath68 i.e. much weaker than for the case when all cluster properties are fixed ( c.f .",
    ". [ eq : rxsz0 ] ) .",
    "similar expression was used by ( see eq .  3 there ) to verify possible redshift solutions for cluster candidates detected by planck .",
    "the same conclusions can be formulated in terms of the x - ray surface brightness at a given energy @xmath39 and compton @xmath69-parameter @xmath70 : @xmath71 for a cluster obeying self - similar scaling both the x - ray surface brightness and the @xmath69-parameter grow strongly with distance .",
    "the ratio of these two quantities , of course , behaves similarly to the ratio of total fluxes  see eq .",
    "[ eq : rxsz1 ] .    in reality , scaling relations , involving physics of baryons , deviate to various degree from the self - similar relations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent work ) .",
    "for a sample of x - ray selected clusters at @xmath26 the following relations have been derived @xcite : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the rest frame cluster luminosity in the 0.5 - 2 kev band , @xmath74 and @xmath75 . here",
    "@xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the mean atomic weight of a gas particle , and @xmath78 is the fraction of electrons in the total gas number density .",
    "the above relations can be used straightforwardly to predict the dependence of @xmath49 and @xmath50 on @xmath30 for a fixed cluster mass , as shown in fig.[fig : raw ] , ( right panel ) .",
    "the conclusion that @xmath49 does not decrease with redshift beyond @xmath15 holds both for pure self - similar and empirical scaling relations .",
    "it is a generic consequence of self - similar evolution in the @xmath0cdm cosmological model .",
    "given that for empirical relations @xmath81 and @xmath82 one can expect that in the ratio of these two observables @xmath83 the mass dependence approximately cancels out and @xmath80 is primarily a function of @xmath30 .",
    "this is further illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] , which shows the value of @xmath80 for clusters with given mass @xmath84 and slightly different definitions of @xmath85 and @xmath49 .",
    "different colors correspond to : red - scaling relations ( [ eq : escale ] ) and @xmath49 in the 0.5 - 2 kev band ; green - the same scaling relations , but @xmath49 in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev band ; blue - @xmath49 in the 0.5 - 2 kev band and @xmath86-@xmath87 scaling relation from .",
    "although the masses differ by an order of magnitude the @xmath88 curves are very similar . the black dashed line show a simple analytic approximation of the data shown in red color : @xmath89 which does not have physical meaning , but roughly reproduces the expected @xmath80 dependence over the redshift range of interest .",
    "black squares show a small sample of spt clusters with x - ray data from @xcite . for the relevant redshift range ( up to @xmath90 ) the value of @xmath80 changes by an order of magnitude , implying that it can be used to approximately divide clusters in few redshift bins over @xmath91 , despite the substantial scatter of cluster properties around the mean scaling relations .",
    "we now consider how clusters populate the @xmath92 , @xmath93 plane , using predictions of the abundance of virialized halos at a given redshift / mass . to this end , we use the mass function of @xcite .",
    "we start by calculating cluster abundance @xmath94 for a grid over @xmath30 and @xmath95 . for each pair of @xmath30 and @xmath87",
    "we use scaling relations ( [ eq : escale ] ) to calculate @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the results of these calculations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] .",
    "the size of the circle is proportional to the log of the number of clusters per grid cell ,",
    "i.e. @xmath96 . only cells with more than one cluster are shown .",
    "cells , corresponding to the constant mass or redshift are connected with red and blue lines respectively .",
    "as expected , blue lines are almost horizontal , implying that the ratio @xmath97 changes with @xmath30 , but is weakly dependent on mass ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath80 can serve as a redshift indicator , at least for clusters more massive than @xmath98 . at the same time the red lines ( constant mass ) are nearly vertical at @xmath67 and are slightly inclined at lower redshifts .",
    "this behavior can be traced back to fig.[fig : raw ] ( right panel ) which shows that at fixed mass the @xmath49 curve levels off at @xmath15 .",
    "the curves , corresponding to clusters with different masses will have different minimum flux , which is proportional to the mass of the cluster , if one adopts simplified @xmath99 relation according to eq.[eq : fx_simple ] . with the scaling relations adopted here ( eq .  [ eq : escale ] )",
    "the mass dependence is steeper ( see below ) .",
    "the approximate orthogonality of the constant redshift and constant mass curves suggests that a combination of x - ray and sz data is a useful indicator of the object redshift and mass . in other words",
    ", there is an approximate mapping of @xmath49 to @xmath100 and @xmath80 to @xmath30 , which is most straightforward in the interesting range of @xmath1011 - 2 .    the expected correlation of the observed x - ray flux and the cluster mass is further illustrated in fig .",

    "[ fig : map ] are used , but this time the mass is plotted as a function of x - ray flux .",
    "clusters from different redshift groups are marked with different colors .",
    "for nearby clusters ( @xmath102 , black circles ) the spread in @xmath49 at a fixed mass is huge . on the contrary , for @xmath103 ( blue and red points )",
    "there is a good correlation between the x - ray flux and the mass .",
    "this correlation appears due to evolution of cluster properties with redshift .",
    "the black dashed line shows a simple analytic approximation of this correlation @xmath104    the most stringent limits on the growth of structure come from the most massive clusters at each redshift . fig .",
    "[ fig : mz ] shows the mass and temperature dependence for the 20 most massive clusters in each redshift bin according the mass - function of @xcite .",
    "the characteristic mass changes by an order of magnitude ( red line in the top panel of fig .  [ fig : mz ] ) , while the characteristic temperature stays above 4 - 5 kev over the redshift range 0 - 3 .",
    "the relativistic corrections to the sz signal can be important for most massive clusters at @xmath105 , while for more distant ( @xmath67 ) massive clusters they are expected to be small .",
    "the locus of these massive clusters in the @xmath106 plane is shown with purple circles .",
    "it is clear that these clusters form a elongated and narrow band in the plane , implying that picking clusters candidates from this band will provide a useful sub - sample for further studies .",
    "with out definition of x - ray and sz signals the most massive clusters at a given @xmath49 correspond to those below the line @xmath107 ( black solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] ) .",
    "there are @xmath10810 massive clusters below this line per each x - ray flux interval @xmath109 $ ] over the whole range of interest .",
    "the above discussion completely neglects the scatter of cluster properties around the adopted scaling relations .",
    "this scatter in @xmath110 is considerable ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and will spread the clusters in the @xmath106 plane .",
    "we assume that the scatter in @xmath111 and @xmath112 is 0.4 and 0.13 respectively @xcite and that the scatter is independent in these two variables . with this assumptions the expected level of the scatter in the @xmath106 plane",
    "is shown with a green ellipse in fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] with @xmath113 of the major and minor axes of 0.57 and 0.09 respectively . note , that since the scatter in @xmath49 is substantially larger than the scatter in @xmath85 , we choose to plot an ellipse , corresponding to 68% probability for one degree of freedom ( rather than for two ) .",
    "when scatter is included the selection cut for massive clusters has to be modified . assuming that we want 90% of the most massive clusters to be captured by the selection ( i.e. those objects which without intrinsic scatter would be below the solid line ) , we need to increase the selection cut by as factor 1.34 ( black dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] ) , as demonstrated by monte carlo simulations .",
    "thus , selecting objects with @xmath114 will ensure that 9 out of 10 most massive clusters will not be lost from the sample due to intrinsic scatter .",
    "of course this relaxed selection will contain factor @xmath115 more objects than our target sample at @xmath116 .",
    "i.e. , about @xmath117 cluster candidates has to be followed up in order to identify 10 most massive ones .",
    "this is nevertheless a substantial improvement compared to the total number of objects per @xmath49 bin without @xmath80 cut , which is another factor of @xmath115 larger .",
    "we also used a monte carlo approach to estimate the uncertainties in evaluating @xmath30 via eq.([eq : rxsz ] ) .",
    "for each redshift the scatter is added to @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the value of @xmath80 is calculated and eq.([eq : rxsz ] ) is used to recover the redshift .",
    "the estimated uncertainties in @xmath30 correspond to lower / upper 17% of the probability distribution . for @xmath118 and 2 ,",
    "these intervals are : @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "as expected , the uncertainties are large , but suitable for pre - selection of massive and distant clusters for further studies .",
    "for the mass determination using eq.([eq : fx_mass ] ) the uncertainty is factor @xmath1081.4 in the normalization of eq.([eq : fx_mass ] ) ( see previous section ) .",
    "additional uncertainty due to the scatter in @xmath49 adds another @xmath10822% to the mass estimate .",
    "finally , we note that @xmath106 is not the only pair of variables which can be used for preselection of clusters , but it is one of the most straightforward and simple combinations of the observables . in practice",
    "the selection strategy has to be optimized for a particular set of instruments / observables used in the x - ray and sz surveys .",
    "in @xmath0cdm universe distant clusters with a given mass are denser and hotter compared to their local counterparts .",
    "this boosts strongly the rest frame x - ray luminosity of distant clusters and compensates for the dimming of the x - ray signal with distance .",
    "this implies that similarly to sz surveys , x - ray telescopes are able to detect massive cluster over entire observable universe . if the cluster can be detected at @xmath15 , similar mass objects can be detected at any redshift .",
    "a combination of x - ray and sz observables happens to be a simple indicator of @xmath30 and @xmath87 ( see eq.[eq : rxsz ] and [ eq : fx_mass ] and fig.[fig : ratio ] and [ fig : fx_mass ] ) , which can be used to approximately classify clusters in broad mass / redshift bins for the spectroscopic followup .",
    "provided that local scaling relations hold for larger redshift the ratio @xmath80 of x - ray flux to the total @xmath85 is almost independent on the mass and serves as convenient redshift indicator , while the x - ray flux itself can be used as the mass proxy ( for objects with sufficiently large redshift @xmath122 , or , equivalently , with sufficiently low @xmath80 ) .",
