    "the absence of a signal of supersymmetric partners at the lhc up to the mass range of 12 tev @xcite increased an interest in the heavy supersymmetry scenarios @xcite of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , where the condition @xmath2125 gev for the lightest @xmath3-even scalar state , perhaps , observed by the atlas and cms collaborations @xcite is respected explicitly in the mssm parameter space .",
    "large radiative corrections to the mssm two - higgs doublet sector which raise up @xmath6 from the maximal tree - level value of @xmath7 to the observable value of 125 gev appear due to large values of soft supersymmetry breaking parameters , which are associated with large masses of third generation quark supersymmetric partners , large mixing of supersymmetric partners , and restricted from above by the availability of perturbative regime .",
    "for this reason acceptable domains of the mssm parameter space are rather limited @xcite although there are several variants of such fine tuning. in order to ease tensions of parametric scenarios of the mssm , two ways of action are appropriate , first , more precise calculations of radiative corrections at higher loops / decomposition of the effective potential in the higher inverse powers of @xmath8 ( i.e. including effective operators @xmath9 in the decomposition of coleman - weinberg type potential ) ; second , the transition to extensions of the mssm .",
    "for example , extensions of the mssm where the superpotential includes an additional chiral singlet field ( next to minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) @xcite ) , or more chiral fields , are known .",
    "it is assumed that some new physics beyond the mssm exists at an energy scale which is not too far away .",
    "probably , such scale of the order of 10@xmath10 tev is somewhat higher than the mass scale of superpartners @xmath8 .    in the framework of a picture where mssm is a low - energy limit of an extended theory ( not only nmssm , for example",
    ", supersymmetric grand unification models @xcite or supersymmetric left - right models @xcite ) all possible effective operators of higher dimension should be introduced with the following separation of the observables which are sensitive to effects of the extended theory for phenomenological analysis .",
    "the effective lagrangian of the mssm extension can be written as a sum of operators suppressed by inverse powers of the new physics scale @xmath11 and @xmath12 , each of which is @xmath13 invariant and respects @xmath14-parity . in the extended theory",
    "such operators are generated either at the tree - level or at the loop - level .",
    "it was expected that contributions of the tree - level operators to the specific observables were more important because the loop - level operators have an additional suppression factors proportional to @xmath15 .",
    "however , additional enhancements by large mssm parameters ( like @xmath16 which can compensate also an extra power of the mass scale @xmath17 ) make the situation with various contributions rather nontrivial .",
    "a number of studies prior to higgs boson discovery can be found in the literature .",
    "a complete list of the tree - level dimension - five and dimension - six effective operators can be found in @xcite .",
    "note that supersymmetry restricts possible effective operator categories , for example , no operators of dimension - five involving higgs - higgsino supermultiplet and gauge - gaugino supermultiplet exist since no gauge invariant form can be constructed using three mssm chiral superfields .",
    "analogously , no operators of dimension - six involving higgs - higgsino supermultiplet exist because operators of this type must contain five chiral superfields , apparently , such forms violate gauge invariance .",
    "various aspects related to an extensions by the dimension - five / dimension - six operators were systematically analyzed in @xcite .    as mentioned above ,",
    "radiative corrections coming from the loop diagrams with top quark and top superpartner are very important @xcite both for large @xmath18 and small @xmath18 parameter .",
    "the tree - level mass of the lightest @xmath3-even state @xmath19 is maximized at large @xmath18 . for small trilinear parameters @xmath20 and large stop mass scale @xmath8 when @xmath21 and @xmath22 are less than one ( in other words , in the case of moderate stop mixing parameter @xmath23 ) , the correction to @xmath6 at the one - loop is controlled by the logarithm @xmath24 which is large enough for @xmath8 of the order of 10100 tev . for large trilinear parameters @xmath20 ( or in the case of large stop mixing parameter )",
    "the correction is maximized at @xmath25 ( so - called maximal mixing scenario at the one - loop ) , and much smaller @xmath8 values of the order of 1 tev are appropriate . at @xmath26 or even smaller ,",
    "large mixing may appear due to large higgs superfield mass parameter @xmath27 of about 10 tev .",
    "nontrivial interplay of @xmath28 and @xmath18 parameters at the level of one - loop resummed higgs potential was analyzed in detail for the potential decomposition in the inverse powers of @xmath8 up to operators of the dimension - four .",
    "the case of small mass splittings for quark superpartners @xcite was generalized for the situation when each stop and sbottom is independently decoupled at its specific mass scale @xcite for some special mssm effective potentials .",
    "note that the two - loop effects may be included by using a renormalization group improvement of the effective potential @xcite .",
    "the scale dependence of the one - loop result is reduced if the two - loop renormalization group improvement of the one - loop effective potential is accounted for @xcite .    in this paper the effective mssm higgs potential decomposition up to operators of the dimension - six involving scalars only is considered .",
    "contribution of the dimension - six operators to observables can be separated insofar , as already mentioned above , the dimension - six operators involving only scalar isodoublets appear at the loop - level only . in section 2 the mass basis for extended higgs sector is constructed . in section 3",
    "analytical expressions for the threshold corrections are derived and some numerical evaluations for the mass spectra are performed .",
    "in this section we construct the basis for the mass states of physical scalars following @xcite , where the case of dimension - four operators has been considered .",
