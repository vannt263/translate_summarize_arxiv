    "this article investigates the violation of bell inequalities in macroscopic situations and analyses how this indicates the presence of genuine quantum structure .",
    "we explicitly challenge the common belief that quantum structure is present only in micro - physical reality ( and macroscopic coherent systems ) , and present evidence that quantum structure can be present in the macro - physical reality .",
    "we also give an example showing the presence of quantum structure in the mind .",
    "let us begin with a brief account of the most relevant historical results . in the seventies ,",
    "a sequence of experiments was carried out to test for the presence of nonlocality in the microworld described by quantum mechanics ( clauser 1976 ; faraci at al .",
    "1974 ; freeman and clauser 1972 ; holt and pipkin 1973 ; kasday , ullmann and wu 1970 ) culminating in decisive experiments by aspect and his team in paris ( aspect , grangier and roger , 1981 , 1982 ) .",
    "they were inspired by three important theoretical results : the epr paradox ( einstein , podolsky and rosen , 1935 ) , bohm s thought experiment ( bohm , 1951 ) , and bell s theorem ( bell 1964 ) .",
    "einstein , podolsky , and rosen believed to have shown that quantum mechanics is incomplete , in that there exist elements of reality that can not be described by it ( einstein , podolsky and rosen , 1935 ; aerts 1984 , 2000 ) .",
    "bohm took their insight further with a simple example : the ` coupled spin-@xmath0 entity ' consisting of two particles with spin @xmath0 , of which the spins are coupled such that the quantum spin vector is a nonproduct vector representing a singlet spin state ( bohm 1951 ) .",
    "it was bohm s example that inspired bell to formulate a condition that would test experimentally for incompleteness .",
    "the result of his efforts are the infamous bell inequalities ( bell 1964 ) .",
    "the fact that bell took the epr result literally is evident from the abstract of his 1964 paper :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  the paradox of einstein , podolsky and rosen was advanced as an argument that quantum theory could not be a complete theory but should be supplemented by additional variables .",
    "these additional variables were to restore to the theory causality and locality . in this note",
    "that idea will be formulated mathematically and shown to be incompatible with the statistical predictions of quantum mechanics .",
    "it is the requirement of locality , or more precisely that the result of a measurement on one system be unaffected by operations on a distant system with which is has interacted in the past , that creates the essential difficulty . \" _",

    "he believed that if experiments were performed to test for the presence of nonlocality as predicted by quantum mechanics , they would show quantum mechanics to be wrong , and locality to hold .",
    "therefore , he believed that he had discovered a way of showing experimentally that quantum mechanics is wrong .",
    "the physics community awaited the outcome of these experiments . today",
    ", as we know , all of them agreed with quantum predictions , and as consequence , it is commonly accepted that the micro - physical world is incompatible with local realism .",
    "one of the present authors , studying bell inequalities from a different perspective , developed a concrete example of a situation involving macroscopic ` classical ' entities that violates bell inequalities ( aerts 1981 , 1982 , 1985a , b ) .",
    "this example makes it possible to more fully understand the origin of the violation of the inequalities , as well as in what sense this violation indicates the presence of quantum structure .",
    "in this section we review bell inequalities , as well as clauser and horne inequalities .",
    "we first consider bohm s original example that violates these inequalities in the microworld .",
    "finally we we put forth an example that violates them in the macroworld .",
    "bell inequalities are defined with the following experimental situation in mind .",
    "we consider a physical entity @xmath1 , and four experiments @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 that can be performed on the physical entity @xmath1 .",
    "each of the experiments @xmath6 has two possible outcomes , respectively denoted @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "some of the experiments can be performed together , which in principle leads to ` coincidence ' experiments @xmath9 .",
    "for example @xmath10 and @xmath11 together will be denoted @xmath12 .",
    "such a coincidence experiment @xmath12 has four possible outcomes , namely @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "following bell , we introduce the expectation values @xmath17 for these coincidence experiments , as @xmath18 > from the assumption that the outcomes are either + 1 or -1 , and that the correlation @xmath19 can be written as an integral over some hidden variable of a product of the two local outcome assignments , one derives bell inequalities :    @xmath20    when bell introduced the inequalities , he had in mind the quantum mechanical situation originally introduced by bohm ( bohm 1951 ) of correlated spin-@xmath0 particles in the singlet spin state . here",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 refer to measurements of spin at the left location in spin directions @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 refer to measurements of spin at the right location in spin directions @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the quantum theoretical calculation in this situation , for well chosen directions of spin , gives the value @xmath25 for the left member of equation ( [ bellineq ] ) , and hence violates the inequalities .",
    "since bell showed that the inequalities are never violated if locality holds for the considered experimental situation , this indicates that quantum mechanics predicts nonlocal effects to exist ( bell 1964 ) .",
    "we should mention that clauser and horne derived other inequalities , and it is the clauser horne inequalities that have been tested experimentally ( clauser and horne 1976 ) .",
    "clauser and horne consider the same experimental situation as that considered by bell .",
    "hence we have the coincidence experiments @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , but instead of concentrating on the expectation values they introduce the coincidence probabilities @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , together with the probabilities @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "concretely , @xmath36 means the probability that the coincidence experiment @xmath12 gives the outcome @xmath13 , while @xmath37 means the probability that the experiment @xmath10 gives the outcome @xmath7 .",
    "the clauser horne inequalities then read :    @xmath38    although the clauser horne inequalities are thought to be equivalent to bell inequalities , they are of a slightly more general theoretical nature , and lend themselves to pitowsky s generalization , which will play an important role in our theoretical analysis .",
    "let us briefly consider bohm s original example .",
    "our physical entity @xmath1 is now a pair of quantum particles of spin-@xmath0 that ` fly to the left and the right ' along a certain direction @xmath39 of space respectively , and are prepared in a singlet state @xmath40 for the spin ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . we consider four experiments @xmath41 , that are measurements of the spin of the particles in directions @xmath42 , that are four directions of space orthogonal to the direction @xmath39 of flight of the particles .",
    "we choose the experiments such that @xmath2 and @xmath3 are measurements of the spin of the particle flying to the left and @xmath4 and @xmath5 of the particle flying to the right ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    1 cm     5 cm fig .  1 : the singlet spin state example .",
    "we call @xmath37 the probability that the experiment @xmath10 gives outcome @xmath7 . according to quantum mechanical calculation and considering the different experiments",
    ", it follows :    @xmath43    for the bohm example , the experiment @xmath2 can be performed together with the experiments @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which leads to experiment @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and the experiment @xmath3 can also be performed together with the experiments @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which leads to experiments @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "quantum mechanically this corresponds to the expectation value @xmath44 which gives us the well known predictions :    @xmath45    let us first specify the situation that gives rise to a maximal violation of bell inequalities .",
    "let @xmath46 be coplanar directions such that @xmath47 , and @xmath48 ( see fig .",
    "then we have @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this gives :    @xmath51    which shows that bell inequalities are violated .",
    "3.1 cm     fig .  2 : the violation of bell inequalities by the singlet spin state example .    to violate the clauser horne inequalities , we need to make another choice for the spin directions .",
    "let us choose @xmath52 again coplanar with @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( see fig .",
    "the set of probabilities that we consider for the clauser horne inequalities is then given by @xmath55 .",
    "this gives :    @xmath56    which shows that also the clauser horne inequalities are violated ( see fig .",
    "3 ) .    3.1 cm     fig .  3 : the violation of clauser horne inequalities by the singlet spin state example .",
    "we now review an example of a macroscopic situation where bell inequalities and clauser horne inequalities are violated ( aerts 1981 , 1982 , 1985a , b ) . following this ,",
    "we analyze some aspects of the example in a new way .    4 cm     = 7pt fig .  4 : the vessels of water example violating bell inequalities .",
    "the entity @xmath1 consists of two vessels containing 20 liters of water that are connected by a tube .",
    "experiments are performed on both sides of the entity @xmath1 by introducing syphons @xmath57 and @xmath58 in the respective vessels and pouring out the water and collecting it in reference vessels @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "carefully chosen experiments reveal that bell inequalities are violated by this entity @xmath1 .",
    "consider an entity @xmath1 which is a container with 20 liters of transparent water ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , in a state @xmath61 such that the container is placed in the gravitational field of the earth , with its bottom horizontal .",
    "we introduce the experiment @xmath2 that consists of putting a siphon @xmath57 in the container of water at the left , taking out water using the siphon , and collecting this water in a reference vessel @xmath59 placed to the left of the container .",
    "if we collect more than 10 liters of water , we call the outcome @xmath62 , and if we collect less or equal to 10 liters , we call the outcome @xmath63 .",
    "we introduce another experiment @xmath3 that consists of taking with a little spoon , from the left , a bit of the water , and determining whether it is transparent .",
    "we call the outcome @xmath64 when the water is transparent and the outcome @xmath65 when it is not .",
    "we introduce the experiment @xmath4 that consists of putting a siphon @xmath66 in the container of water at the right , taking out water using the siphon , and collecting this water in a reference vessel @xmath67 to the right of the container .",
    "if we collect more or equal to 10 liters of water , we call the outcome @xmath68 , and if we collect less than 10 liters , we call the outcome @xmath69",
    ". we also introduce the experiment @xmath5 which is analogous to experiment @xmath3 , except that we perform it to the right of the container .    clearly , for the container of water being in state @xmath61 , experiments @xmath2 and @xmath4 give with certainty the outcome @xmath62 and @xmath68 , which shows that @xmath70 .",
    "experiments @xmath3 and @xmath5 give with certainty the outcome @xmath64 and @xmath71 , which shows that @xmath72 .    the experiment @xmath2 can be performed together with experiments @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and we denote the coincidence experiments @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "also , experiment @xmath3 can be performed together with experiments @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and we denote the coincidence experiments @xmath28 and @xmath29 . for the container in state @xmath61",
    ", the coincidence experiment @xmath26 always gives one of the outcomes @xmath73 or @xmath74 , since more than 10 liters of water can never come out of the vessel at both sides .",
    "this shows that @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the coincidence experiment @xmath27 always gives the outcome @xmath77 which shows that @xmath78 and @xmath79 , and the coincidence experiment @xmath28 always gives the outcome @xmath80 which shows that @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "clearly experiment @xmath29 always gives the outcome @xmath83 which shows that @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "let us now calculate the terms of bell inequalities , @xmath86 and of the clauser horne inequalities , @xmath87 this shows that bell inequalities and clauser horne inequalities can be violated in macroscopic reality .",
    "it is even so that the example violates the inequalities more than the original quantum example of the two coupled spin-@xmath0 entities . in section 5",
    "we analyze why this is the case , and show that this sheds new light on the underlying mechanism that leads to the violation of the inequalities .",
    "in the macroscopic example of the vessels of water connected by a tube , we can see and understand why the inequalities are violated .",
    "this is not the case for the micro - physical bohm example of coupled spins .",
    "szabo ( pers . com . ) suggested that the macroscopic violation of bell inequalities by the vessels of water example does not have the same ` status ' as the microscopic violation in the bohm example of entangled spins , because events are identified that are not identical .",
    "this idea was first considered in aerts and szabo , 1993 . here",
    "we investigate it more carefully and we will find that it leads to a deeper insight into the meaning of the violation of the inequalities .",
    "let us state more clearly what we mean by reconsidering the vessels of water example from section [ section03 ] , where we let the experiments @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 correspond with possible events @xmath88 and @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 and @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "this means that event @xmath88 is the physical event that happens when experiment @xmath2 is carried out , and outcome @xmath62 occurs .",
    "the same for the other events .",
    "when event @xmath88 occurs together with event @xmath93 , hence during the performance of the experiments @xmath96 , then it is definitely a different event from event @xmath88 that occurs together with event @xmath94 , hence during the performance of the experiment @xmath27 .",
    "szabo s idea was that this ` fact ' would be at the origin of the violation of bell inequalities for the macroscopic vessel of water example . in this sense",
    "the macroscopic violation would not be a genuine violation as compared to the microscopic .",
    "of course , one is tempted to ask the same question in the quantum case : is the violation in the microscopic world perhaps due to a lack of distinguishing events that are in fact not identical ? perhaps what is true for the vessels of water example is also true of the bohm example ?",
    "let us find out by systematically distinguishing between events at the left ( of the vessels of water or of the entangled spins ) that are made together with different events at the right .",
    "in this way , we get more than four events , and unfortunately the original bell inequalities are out of their domain of applicability",
    ". however pitowsky has developed a generalization of bell inequalities where any number of experiments and events can be taken into account , and as a consequence we can check whether the new situation violates pitowsky inequalities . if pitowsky inequalities would not be violated in the vessels of water model , while for the microscopic bohm example they would , then this would ` prove ' the different status of the two examples , the macroscopic being ` false ' , due to lack of correctly distinguishing between events , and the microscopic being genuine .",
    "let us first introduce pitowsky inequalities to see how the problem can be reformulated .",
    "pitowsky proved ( see theorem [ theorem01 ] ) that the situation where bell - type inequalities are satisfied is equivalent to the situation where , for a set of probabilities connected to the outcomes of the considered experiments , there exists a kolmogorovian probability model . or , as some may want to paraphrase it , the probabilities are classical ( pitowsky 1989 ) . to put forward pitowsky inequalities",
    ", we have to introduce some mathematical concepts .",
    "let @xmath1 be a set of pairs of integers from @xmath97 that is , @xmath98 let @xmath99 denote the real space of all functions @xmath100 .",
    "we shall denote vectors in @xmath101 by @xmath102 , where the @xmath103 appear in a lexicographic order on the @xmath104 .",
    "let @xmath105 be the set of all @xmath106-tuples of zeroes and one s .",
    "we shall denote elements of @xmath105 by @xmath107 where @xmath108 .",
    "for each @xmath109 let @xmath110 be the following vector in @xmath99 : @xmath111 the classical correlation polytope @xmath112 is the closed convex hull in @xmath99 of all @xmath113 possible vectors @xmath114 , @xmath115 :    [ pitowsky , 1989 ] [ theorem01 ] let @xmath116 be a vector in @xmath101 .",
    "then @xmath117 if there is a kolmogorovian probability space @xmath118 and ( not necessarily distinct ) events @xmath119 such that : @xmath120 where @xmath121 is ... , @xmath122 is the space of events and @xmath123 the probability measure    to illustrate the theorem and at the same time the connection with bell inequalities and the clauser horne inequalities , let us consider some specific examples of pitowsky s theorem .",
    "the case @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "the condition @xmath126 is then equivalent to the clauser - horne inequalities ( see ( [ bellineq ] ) ) : @xmath127    the case @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "we find then the following inequalities equivalent to the condition @xmath126 : @xmath130 it can be shown that these inequalities are equivalent to the original bell inequalities ( pitowsky 1989 ) .",
    "let us now introduce a new situation wherein the events are systematically distinguished . for the vessels of water example ,",
    "we introduce the following events : event @xmath131 corresponds to the physical process of experiment @xmath2 , leading to outcome @xmath62 , performed together with experiment @xmath4 leading to outcome @xmath68 .",
    "event @xmath132 corresponds to the physical process of experiment @xmath2 leading to outcome @xmath62 , performed together with experiment @xmath5 , leading to outcome @xmath71 . in order to introduce the other events and avoid repetition ,",

    "having distinguished the events in this way , we are certain the different joint experiments give rise to real joint events .",
    "we can now apply pitowsky s theorem to the set of events @xmath139 .",
    "suppose that there is an equal probability of experiment @xmath2 being performed with @xmath4 or @xmath5 , and similarly for the joint performance of @xmath3 with @xmath4 or @xmath5 .",
    "according to this assumption , the observed probabilities are : @xmath140 the obtained probability vector is then @xmath141 .",
    "applying pitowsky s approach , we could directly calculate that this probability vector is contained in the convex hull of the corresponding space , and hence as a consequence of pitowsky s theorem it allows a kolmogorovian probability representation ( aerts and szabo 1993 ) .",
    "this means that after the distinction between events has been made , the vessels of water example no longer violates pitowsky inequalities .",
    "an important question remains : would the violation of the inequalities similarly vanish for the microscopic spin example ?",
    "let us , exactly as we have done in the vessels of water example , distinguish the events we are not certain we can identify , for the case of the correlated spin situation .",
    "again we find 8 events : event @xmath131 corresponds to the physical process of experiment @xmath2 leading to outcome @xmath62 , performed together with experiment @xmath4 , leading to outcome @xmath68 .",
    "analogously , events @xmath132 , @xmath142 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 are introduced .",
    "again , the physical process of the joint experiment @xmath26 corresponds then to the joint event @xmath148 , the physical process of the joint experiment @xmath27 to the joint event @xmath136 , the physical process of the joint experiment @xmath28 to the joint event @xmath149 , and the physical process of the joint experiment @xmath29 to the joint event @xmath138 .",
    "suppose that directions @xmath21 or @xmath22 , as well as @xmath23 or @xmath24 , are chosen with the same probability at both sides .",
    "according to this assumption the observed probabilities are :    @xmath150    the question is whether the correlation vector @xmath151 admits a kolmogorovian representation .",
    "to answer this question , we have to check whether it is inside the corresponding classical correlation polytope @xmath152 .",
    "there are no derived inequalities for @xmath153 , expressing the condition @xmath154 .",
    "lacking such inequalities we must directly check the geometric condition @xmath117 .",
    "we were able to do this for the vessels of water example because of the simplicity of the correlation vector , but we had no general way to do this .",
    "it is however possible to prove the existence of a kolmogorovian representation in a general way :    let events @xmath155 and a set of indices @xmath1 be given such that non of the indices appears in two different elements of @xmath1 .",
    "assume that for each pair @xmath156 the restricted correlation vector @xmath157 has an @xmath158 kolmogorovian representation .",
    "then the product space @xmath159 provides a kolmogorovian representation for the whole correlation vector @xmath160 .",
    "this theorem shows that if the distinctions that we have explained are made , the inequalities corresponding to the situation will no longer be violated .",
    "this also means that we can state that the macroscopic violation , certainly with respect to the distinction or identification of events , is as genuine as the microscopic violation of the inequalities .",
    "in this section we show how bell inequalities are violated in the mind in virtue of the relationship between abstract concepts and specific instances of them .",
    "we start with a thought experiment that outlines a possible scenario wherein this sort of violation of bell inequalities reveals itself .",
    "this example was first presented in aerts and gabora 1999 .",
    "we then briefly discuss implications for cognition .      to make things more concrete we begin with an example .",
    "keynote players in this example are the two cats , glimmer and inkling , that live at our research center ( fig .",
    "the experimental situation has been set up by one of the authors ( diederik ) to show that the mind of another of the authors ( liane ) violates bell inequalities .",

    "the coincidence experiment @xmath26 gives outcome ( @xmath62 , @xmath69 ) or ( @xmath63 , @xmath68 ) because indeed from ( 2 ) it follows that liane will think of glimmer or inkling .",
    "this means that @xmath163 .",
    "the coincidence experiment @xmath27 gives outcome ( @xmath62 , @xmath71 ) , because from ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) it follows that she thinks of glimmer and hears the bell .",
    "hence @xmath78 .",
    "the coincidence experiment @xmath28 also gives outcome ( @xmath64 , @xmath68 ) , because from ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) it follows that she thinks of inkling and hears the bell .",
    "hence @xmath81 .",
    "the coincidence experiment @xmath29 gives ( @xmath64 , @xmath71 ) , because from ( 4 ) it follows that she hears two bells .",
    "hence @xmath84 . as a consequence",
    "we have :    @xmath164    the reason that bell inequalities are violated is that liane s state of mind changes from activation of the abstract categorical concept ` cat ' , to activation of either ` glimmer ' or ` inkling ' .",
    "we can thus view the state ` cat ' as an entangled state of these two instances of it .",
    "we end this section by saying that we apologize for the pun on bell s name , but it seemed like a good way to ring in these new ideas .",
    "our example shows that concepts in the mind violate bell inequalities , and hence entail nonlocality in the sense that physicists use the concept .",
    "this violation of bell inequalities takes place within the associative network of concepts and episodic memories constituting an internal model of reality , or worldview .",
    "we now briefly investigate how this cognitive source of nonlocality arises , and its implications for cognition and our understanding of reality .",
    "as a first approximation , we can say that the nonlocality of stored experiences and concepts arises from their distributed nature .",
    "each concept is stored in many memory locations ; likewise , each location participates in the storage of many concepts . in order for the mind to be capable of generating a stream of meaningfully - related yet potentially creative remindings ,",
    "the degree of this distribution must fall within an intermediate range .",
    "thus , a given experience activates not just one location in memory , nor does it activate every memory location to an equal degree , but activation is distributed across many memory locations , with degree of activation falling with distance from the most activated one .",
    "6 shows schematically how this feature of memory is sometimes modeled in neural networks using a radial basis function ( rbf ) ( hancock et al .",
    ", 1991 ; holden and niranjan , 1997 ; lu et al . 1997 ; willshaw and dayan , 1990 ) .    3.2 cm     = 7pt fig  6 : highly schematized diagram of a stimulus input activating two dimensions of a memory or conceptual space .",
    "each vertex represents a possible memory location , and black dots represent actual location in memory .",
    "activation is maximal at the center k of the rbf , and tapers off in all directions according to a gaussian distribution of width s.    memory is also content addressable , meaning that there is a systematic relationship between the content of an experience , and the place in memory where it gets stored ( and from which material for the next instant of experience is sometimes evoked ) .",
    "thus not only is it is not localized as an episodic memory or conceptual entity in conceptual space , but it is also not localized with respect to its physical storage location in the brain .",
    "the more abstract a concept , the greater the number of other concepts that are expected to fall within a given distance of it in conceptual space , and therefore be potentially evoked by it .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "7 shows how the concept of ` container ' is less localized than the concept of ` bag ' .",
    "the concept of ` container ' does not just activate concepts like ` cup ' , it derives its very existence from them .",
    "similarly , once ` cup ' has been identified as an instance of ` container ' , it is forever after affected by it . to activate ` bag ' is to instantaneously affect ` container ' , which is to instantaneously affects the concept ` thing ' , from which ` container ' derives it s identity , and so forth .",
    "4.5 cm     = 7pt fig  7 : a four - dimensional hypercube that schematically represents a segment of memory space .",
    "the stimulus dimensions ` made of paper ' ,  flimsy , ` has holes ' and ` concave ' lie on the @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 , and @xmath168 axes respectively .",
    "three concepts are stored here : ` cup ' , ` bag ' , and ` bag with holes ' .",
    "black - ringed dots represent centers of distributed regions where they are stored .",
    "fuzzy white ball shows region activated by ` cup ' .",
    "emergence of the abstract concept ` container ' implicit in the memory space ( central yellow region ) is made possible by the constrained distribution of activation .",
    "an extremely general concept such as ` depth ' is probably even more nonlocalized .",
    "it is latent in mental representations as dissimilar as ` deep swimming pool ' , ` deep - fried zucchini ' , and ` deeply moving book ' ; it is deeply woven throughout the matrix of concepts that constitute one s worldview . in ( gabora 1998 , 1999 , 2000 ) one author , inspired by kauffman s ( 1993 ) autocatalytic scenario for the origin of life , outlines a scenario for how episodic memories could become collectively entangled through the emergence of concepts to form a hierarchically structured worldview .",
    "the basic idea goes as follows .",
    "much as catalysis increases the number of different polymers , which in turn increases the frequency of catalysis , reminding events increase concept density by triggering abstraction - the formation of abstract concepts or categories such as ` tree ' or ` big'-which in turn increases the frequency of remindings . and just as catalytic polymers reach a critical density where some subset of them undergoes a phase transition to a state where there is a catalytic pathway to each polymer present , concepts reach a critical density where some subset of them undergoes a phase transition to a state where each one is retrievable through a pathway of remindings events or associations .",
    "finally , much as autocatalytic closure transforms a set of molecules into an interconnected and unified living system , conceptual closure transforms a set of memories into an interconnected and unified worldview .",
    "episodic memories are now related to one another through a hierarchical network of increasingly abstract  and what for our purposes is more relevant ",
    "increasingly nonlocalized , concepts .      over the past several decades",
    ", numerous attempts have been made to forge a connection between quantum mechanics and the mind . in these approaches , it is generally assumed that the only way the two could be connected is through micro - level quantum events in the brain exerting macro - level effects on the judgements , decisions , interpretations of stimuli , and other cognitive functions of the conscious mind . from the preceding arguments",
    ", it should now be clear that this is not the only possibility .",
    "if quantum structure can exist at the macro - level , then the process by which the mind arrives at judgements , decisions , and stimulus interpretations could itself be quantum in nature .",
    "we should point out that we are not suggesting that the mind is entirely quantum .",
    "clearly not all concepts and instances in the mind are entangled or violate bell inequalities .",
    "our claim is simply that the mind contains some degree of quantum structure .",
    "in fact , it has been suggested that quantum and classical be viewed as the extreme ends of a continuum , and that most of reality may turn out to lie midway in this continuum , and consist of both quantum and classical aspects in varying proportions ( aerts 1992 ; aerts and durt 1994 ) .",
    "we have seen that quantum and macroscopic systems can violate bell inequalities .",
    "a natural question that arises is the following : is it possible to construct a macroscopical system that violates bell inequalities in exactly the same way as a photon singlet state will ? aerts constructed a very simple model that does exactly this ( aerts 1991 ) .",
    "this model represents the photon singlet state before measurement by means of two points that live in the center of two separate unit spheres , each one following its own space - time trajectory ( in accordance with the conservation of linear and angular momentum ) , but the two points in the center remain connected by means of a rigid but extendable rod ( fig . 8) .",
    "next the two spheres reach the measurement apparatuses .",
    "when one side is measured , the measurement apparatus draws one of the entities to one of the two possible outcomes with probability one half .",
    "however , because the rod is between the two entities , the other entity at the center of the other sphere is drawn toward the opposite side of the sphere as compared with the first entity . only then this second entity is measured .",
    "this is done by attaching a piece of elastic between the two opposite points of the sphere that are parallel with the measurement direction chosen by the experimenter for this side .",
    "the entity falls onto the elastic following the shortest path ( i.e .. orthogonal ) and sticks there .",
    "next the elastic breaks somewhere and drags the entity towards one of the end points ( fig .",
    "9 ) . to calculate the probability of the occurrence of one of the two possible outcomes of the second measurement apparatus , we assume there is a uniform probability of breaking on the elastic .",
    "next we calculate the frequency of the coincidence counts and these turn out to be in exact accordance with the quantum mechanical prediction .    3 cm     = 7pt fig  8 : symbolic representation of the singlet state in the model as two dots in the centers of their respective spheres . also shown is the connecting rod and the measurement directions chosen at each location a and b.    there are two ingredients of this model that seem particularly important .",
    "first we have the rigid rod , which shows the non - separable wholeness of the singlet coincidence measurement ( i.e. the role of the connecting tube between the vessels of water , or the associative pathways between concepts ) .",
    "second , we have the elastic that breaks which gives rise to the probabilistic nature ( the role of the siphon in the vessels of water , or the role of stimulus input in the mind ) of the outcomes .",
    "these two features seem more or less in accordance with the various opinions researchers have about the meaning of the violation of bell inequalities .",
    "indeed , some have claimed that the violation of bell inequalities is due to the non - local character of the theory , and hence in our model to the ` rigid but extendable rod ' , while others have attributed the violation not to any form of non - locality , but rather to the theory being not ` realistic ' or to the intrinsic indeterministic character of quantum theory , and hence to the role of the elastic in our model . as a consequence",
    ", researchers working in this field now carefully refer to the meaning of the violation as the  non - existence of local realism \" .",
    "because of this dichotomy in interpretation we were curious what our model had to say on this issue . to explore this",
    "we extended the above model with the addition of two parameterizations , each parameter allowing us to minimize or maximize one of the two aforementioned features ( aerts d. , aerts s. , coecke b. , valckenborgh f. , 1995 ) .",
    "the question was of course , how bell inequalities would respond to the respective parameterizations .",
    "we will briefly introduce the model and the results .",
    "the way the parameterized model works is exactly analogous to the measurement procedure described above , with two alterations .",
    "first , we impose the restriction that the maximum distance the rigid rod can ` pull ' the second photon out of the center is equal to some parameter called @xmath169 $ ] .",
    "hence setting @xmath170 equal to 1 gives us the old situation , while putting @xmath170 equal to zero means we no longer have a correlation between the two measurements .",
    "second , we allow the piece of elastic only to break inside a symmetrical interval @xmath171 $ ] . setting @xmath172 equal to 1 means",
    "we restore the model to the state it was in before parameterization . setting @xmath172 equal to zero means",
    "we have a classical ` deterministic ' situation , since the elastic can only break in the center ( there remains the indeterminism of the classical unstable equilibrium , because indeed the rod can still move in two ways , up or down ) .",
    "in fact , to be a bit more precise , we have as a set of states of the entity the set of couples @xmath173\\}\\ ] ] each element of the couple belongs to a different sphere with center @xmath174 ( resp @xmath175 due to linear momentum conservation ) and whose radius is parameterized by the correlation parameter @xmath170 . at each side",
    "we have a set of measurements @xmath176 , \\epsilon \\in [ 0,1 ] \\}\\ ] ] the direction @xmath177 can be chosen arbitrarily by the experimenter at each side and denotes the direction of the polarizer .",
    "( of course , for the sake of demonstrating the violation of bell inequalities , the experimenter will choose at random between the specific angles that maximize the value the inequality takes ) .    3 cm     = 7pt fig  9 : the situation immediately before and after the measurement at one side ( left in this case ) has taken place . in the first picture the breakable part of the elastic is shown ( i.e. the interval @xmath178 $ ] on the elastic ) and the maximum radius @xmath170 . in the second picture",
    ", we see how the measurement at location a has altered the state at location b because of the connecting rod .    the value that the parameter @xmath179 takes represents the point of rupture of the elastic and is unknown in so far that it can take any value inside the interval @xmath178 $ ] , and it will do so with a probability that is uniform over the entire interval @xmath178 $ ] .",
    "hence the probability density function related to @xmath179 is a constant : @xmath180 .",
    "this represents our lack of knowledge concerning the specific measurement that occurred , and is the sole source of indeterminism .",
    "as we will show later , if we take @xmath179 to vary within @xmath181 $ ] we have a maximal lack of knowledge about the measurement and we recover the exact quantum predictions . as before ,",
    "the state @xmath182 of the entity before measurement is given by the centers of the two spheres .",
    "the first measurement @xmath2 projects one center , say @xmath183 orthogonally onto the elastic that is placed in the direction @xmath184 chosen by the experimenter at location a and that can only break in the interval @xmath178 $ ] . because it will always fall in the middle of the elastic , and because we assume a uniform probability of breaking within the breakable part of the elastic , the chance that the elastic pulls @xmath183 up is equal to @xmath185 ( as is the probability of it going down ) . which side @xmath183 is to go depends on the specific point of rupture .",
    "be that as it may , the experimenter records the outcome on his side of the experiment as up or down. at the other side of the experiment , call it location b , @xmath186 is pulled towards the opposite side of @xmath183 because of the rigid rod connecting the @xmath183 and @xmath186 . the maximum distance it can be pulled away from the center is equal to @xmath170 , and hence the old @xmath186 transforms to @xmath187 .",
    "next , experiment @xmath3 is performed in exactly the same way as @xmath2 . at location",
    "b , the experimenter chooses a direction , say @xmath188 , and attaches the elastic in this direction .",
    "again @xmath186 is projected orthogonally onto the elastic and the elastic breaks .",
    "the main difference between the first and the second measurement is that @xmath186 is no longer at the center , but rather at @xmath189 .",
    "there are three qualitatively different parts of the elastic where @xmath186 can end up after projection : the unbreakable part between @xmath190 $ ] , the breakable part between @xmath178 $ ] and the unbreakable part between @xmath191 $ ] .",
    "if @xmath186 is in @xmath190 $ ] , then it does not matter where the elastic breaks : @xmath186 will always be dragged up and likewise , if @xmath186 is in @xmath191 $ ] , the outcome will always be down. if , however , @xmath186 is in @xmath178 $ ] , then the probability of @xmath186 being dragged up is equal to the probability that the elastic breaks somewhere in @xmath192 $ ] .",
    "this is the lebesgue measure of the interval divided by the total lebesgue measure of the elastic : @xmath193 this settles the probabilities related to @xmath186 .",
    "as before , we define the coincidence experiment @xmath12 as having four possible outcomes , namely @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( see section 2 ) . following bell , we introduce the expectation values @xmath194 for these coincidence experiments , as    @xmath18    one easily sees that the expectation value related to the coincidence counts also splits up in three parts .",
    "* @xmath195 : + in this case we have @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "hence the expectation value for the coincidence counts becomes @xmath198 we see that putting @xmath199 we get @xmath200 , which is precisely the quantum prediction .",
    "* @xmath201 : + in this case we have @xmath202 and @xmath203 .",
    "hence the expectation value for the coincidence counts becomes @xmath204 * @xmath205 : in this case we have @xmath206 and @xmath207 .",
    "hence the expectation value for the coincidence counts becomes @xmath208      let us now see what value the left hand side of the bell inequality takes for our model for the specific angles that maximize the inequality . for these angles @xmath209 and @xmath210 ,",
    "the condition @xmath211 is satisfied only if @xmath212 . in this case",
    ", we obtain : @xmath213 if , on the other hand we would have chosen @xmath172 and @xmath170 such that @xmath214 we find : @xmath215    we can summarize the results of all foregoing calculations in the following equation :    @xmath216    for @xmath217 , we have two limiting cases that can easily be derived : for @xmath218 the left side of the inequality takes the value 0 , while for @xmath219 it becomes 4 .    for what couples @xmath220 do we violate the inequality ?",
    "clearly , we need only consider the case @xmath221 . demanding that the inequality be satisfied",
    ", we can summarize our findings in the following simple condition : @xmath222    this result indicates that the model leaves no room for interpretation as to the source of the violation : for any @xmath223 , we can restore the inequality by increasing the amount of lack of knowledge on the interaction between the measured and the measuring device , that is by increasing @xmath172 .",
    "the only way to respect bell inequalities for all values of @xmath172 is by putting @xmath218 .",
    "likewise , for any @xmath224 it becomes impossible to restore the validity of the bell inequalities .",
    "the inevitable conclusion is that the correlation is the source of the violation .",
    "the violation itself should come as no surprise , because we have identified @xmath170 as the _ correlation _ between the two measurements , which is precisely the non - local aspect .",
    "this is also obvious from the fact that it is this correlation that makes @xmath225 not representable as an integral of the form @xmath226 as bell requires for the derivation of the inequality .",
    "what may appear surprising however , is the fact that increasing the indeterminism ( increasing @xmath172 ) , decreases the value the inequality takes ! for example , if we take @xmath217 and @xmath227 , we see that the value of the inequality is 4 , which is the largest value the inequality possibly can have , just as in the case of the vessels of water model .",
    "we have presented several arguments to show that bell inequalities can be genuinely violated in situations that do not pertain to the microworld . of course",
    ", this does not decrease the peculiarity of the quantum mechanical violation in the eprb experiment .",
    "what it does , is shed light on the possible underlying mechanisms and provide evidence that the phenomenon is much more general than has been assumed .",
    "the examples that we have worked out  the ` vessels of water ' , the ` concepts in the mind ' , and the ` spheres connected by a rigid rod '  each shed new light on the origin of the violation of bell inequalities .",
    "the vessels of water and the spheres connected by a rigid rod examples , show that ` non - local connectedness ' plays an essential role in bringing the violation about .",
    "the spheres connected by a rigid rod example shows that the presence of quantum uncertainty does not contribute to the violation of the inequality ; on the contrary , increasing quantum uncertainty decreases the violation .",
    "all three examples also reveal another aspect of reality that plays an important role in the violation of bell inequalities : the potential for different actualizations that generate the violation .",
    "the state of the 20 liters of water as present in the connected vessels is potentially , but not actually , equal to ` 5 liters ' plus ` 15 liters ' of water , or ` 11 liters ' plus ` 9 liters ' of water , _",
    "etc_. similarly , we can say that the concept ` cat ' is potentially equal to instances such as our cats , ` glimmer ' and ` inkling ' .",
    "it is this potentiality that is the ` quantum aspect ' in our nonmicroscopic examples , and that allows for a violation of bell - type inequalities . indeed , as we know , this potentiality is the fundamental characteristic of the superposition state as it appears in quantum mechanics .",
    "this means that the aspect of quantum mechanics that generates the violation of bell inequalities , as identified in our examples , is the potential of the considered state . in the connected vessels example",
    ", it is the potential ways of dividing up 20 liters of water . in the concepts in the mind example , it is the potential instances evoked by the abstract concept ` cat ' . in the rigid rod example",
