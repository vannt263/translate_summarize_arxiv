    "the energy per site for a given cylinder is calculated by subtracting the energies of two long cylinders with different lengths @xcite .",
    "we find that the energy is much lower on the narrow yc4 - 0 cylinder ( @xmath46 ) , probably due to the contribution to the energy from short resonating paths that wind around the cylinder .",
    "this effect persists to a lesser extent for yc6 - 0 ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "on all the other cylinders , the energy is consistently around -0.4255(5 ) with wider cylinders having larger uncertainty due to the extrapolation to large @xmath38 .",
    "thus we estimate an approximate upper bound on the energy as -0.4250 . this bound is lower than other recent bounds from the variational entangled pair states method ( @xmath48 ) @xcite and vmc ( @xmath49 ) @xcite .    to explore the low - lying excited states on these cylinders , we apply dmrg to find the singlet and triplet gap .",

    "then we target one more state in the same sector , with the sweeping restricted to exclude the end regions .",
    "the advantage is that the singlet excitations will always appear in the center of cylinder .",

    "the odd sector has a much longer spin correlation length with @xmath59 , as compared with roughly 3 in even sector .",
    "a longer spin correlation length usually indicate smaller spin triplet gap . we find that spin triplet gap is roughly @xmath60 for the odd sector compared with 0.075 for the even sector .",

    "[ xycs](a ) , we show the ee versus subsystem size @xmath72 for ycn-0 cylinders .",
    "since yc cylinders have strong plaquettes appearing on the cylinder edges , we would expect that the ee should oscillate with a pvb pattern , with two high values and one low value corresponding to cuts at strong and weak bonds of plaquettes . with the decay of pvb order to the center",
    ", we also observe the decay of the ee oscillation pattern and measure the ee when its value saturates to a constant value .",
    "we notice that yc6 - 0 has a longer pvb correlation length than yc4 - 0 , since the ee oscillates with more periods near the yc6 - 0 cylinder edges . on the yc8 - 0 cylinder ,",

    "the ee has much stronger dependence on the sub - system size for the even sector . on the contrary for the xc10 - 0 cylinder , the ee saturates in the center of the cylinder for the even sector .",
    "all these results again show that the gs for all the cylinders with @xmath17 are gapped with short spin correlation lengths .        in fig .",
    "[ e - w ] , we present the ee versus cylinder width to extrapolate the topological ee @xmath67 .",
    "it is surprising that not all the data points collapse onto a line .",
    "the ee from xc6 - 0 and xc10 - 0 deviates from a linear extrapolation .",
    "it is possible that xc6 - 0 cylinder is too narrow , so that @xmath17 is too close to the second phase transition point .",
    "the xc10 - 0 cylinder is a valence bond crystal with 20 sites unit cell in the even sector .",
    "we find that @xmath74 , which is close to gapped @xmath7 sl with @xmath75 .    in a recent paper by hong - chen jiang et al.@xcite",
    ", the authors extrapolate the ee to get the tee with @xmath76 and identify @xmath7 sl phase on many models . as those authors realize , for the above method to be accurate when identifying topological phases , all the correlation lengths ( spin - spin , dimer - dimer , etc . )",
    "have to be short compared with the cylinder widths , so that dmrg results will always lead to a minimum entangled state ( mes ) with zero vison flux through the cylinder . for the model in this paper , even though the spin - spin correlation length is short , pvb correlation lengths get longer as the cylinder gets wider .",
    "thus the extrapolation method for the tee would lead to strong finite size effects .",

    "<S> this figure includes cylinders with all orientations , and we see that for our larger circumferences , the xc cylinders appear to have a longer pvb correlation length than the yc cylinders . if the 2d system is at a quantum critical point , the correlation length is expected to be proportional to the circumference by standard finite - size scaling . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that the correlation length actually increases faster than the circumference , suggesting that this system may have weak pvb long - range order in the 2d limit of infinite circumference .    in conclusion </S>",

    "<S> we find that the ground state displays a paramagnetic phase for @xmath16 . by studying pvb order on various cylinders , we find that the pvb correlation length grows at least linearly with the cylinder circumference . </S>",
