    "the spin structure of the proton and @xmath0 physics provide complementary windows on the role of gluonic degrees of freedom in dynamical @xmath1 symmetry breaking in qcd . the small value of the flavour - singlet axial charge @xmath2 which is extracted from the first moment of @xmath3 ( the nucleon s first spin dependent structure function ) @xcite @xmath4 and the large mass of the @xmath0 meson point to large violations of ozi in the flavour - singlet @xmath5 channel @xcite .",
    "the strong ( qcd ) axial anomaly is central to theoretical explanations of the small value of @xmath6 ( about 50% of the ozi value 0.6 ) and the large @xmath0 mass . in this paper",
    "we review the role of the anomaly in the spin structure of the proton and highlight the interplay between the proton s internal spin structure and axial u(1 ) dynamics .    in the qcd parton model the proton s flavour - singlet axial charge @xmath2 receives contributions from the amount of spin carried by quark and gluon partons @xcite and from gluon topology @xcite , viz .",

    "it does not contribution to the value of @xmath6 extracted from polarized deep inelastic scattering but does contribute to the value extracted from @xmath12 elastic scattering .",
    "a quality measurement of @xmath12 elastic scattering could test theoretical ideas about the axial u(1 ) problem and offers a real possibility to settle the famous crewther - t hooft debate @xcite through experiment .    a positive value of @xmath9 acts to reduce the value of @xmath6 extracted from polarized deep inelastic scattering .",
    "measuring the gluon polarization @xmath9 is one of the key goals of qcd spin physics @xcite .",
    "a recent qcd motivated fit to the world @xmath3 data suggests a value @xmath13 @xcite , in agreement with the prediction @xcite based on colour coherence and perturbative qcd .",
    "the interplay between the proton spin problem and the u(1 ) problem is further manifest in the flavour - singlet goldberger - treiman relation @xcite which connects @xmath2 with the @xmath0nucleon coupling constant @xmath14 .",
    "working in the chiral limit it reads @xmath15 where @xmath14 is the @xmath0nucleon coupling constant and @xmath16 is an ozi violating coupling which measures the one particle irreducible coupling of the topological charge density @xmath17 to the nucleon .",

    "thus write @xmath2 as the sum of `` quark '' and `` gluonic '' contributions . here",
    "we have to be careful because of the gauge dependence of @xmath31 .    whilst @xmath31 is a gauge dependent operator , its forward matrix elements are invariant under the `` small '' gauge transformations of perturbative qcd . in deep inelastic processes the internal structure of the nucleon",

    "the issue of `` large '' gauge transformations means that the spin structure of the proton is especially sensitive to the details of axial u(1 ) symmetry breaking .",
    "spontaneous u(1 ) symmetry breaking in qcd is associated with a massless kogut - susskind pole which couples equally and with opposite sign to the two gauge dependent currents @xmath40 and @xmath31 , thus decoupling from @xmath35 @xcite .",

    "since @xmath51 does not couple to a massless goldstone boson ( the @xmath0 is heavy ) it follows that @xmath52 and @xmath53 contain no massless pole terms .",

    "we may define a gauge - invariant form - factor @xmath58 for the topological charge density ( 9 ) in the divergence of @xmath31 : @xmath59 working in a covariant gauge , we find @xmath60 by contracting eq.(15 ) with @xmath61 .",
    "when we make a gauge transformation any change @xmath62 in @xmath63 is compensated by a corresponding change in the residue of the kogut - susskind pole in @xmath56 , viz .",

    "it is determined by the gluonic boundary conditions at `` infinity '' @xcite  a large surface with boundary which is spacelike with respect to the positions @xmath65 of any operators or fields in the physical problem  and is insensitive to any local deformations of the gluon field @xmath66 or of the gauge transformation @xmath67  that is , perturbative qcd degrees of freedom .",
    "when we take the fourier transform to momentum space the topological structure induces a light - cone zero - mode which has support only at @xmath68 .",
    "hence , we are led to consider the possibility that there may be a term in @xmath3 which is proportional to @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "it remains an open question whether the net non - perturbative quantity which is shuffled between the @xmath30 and @xmath31 contributions to @xmath2 under `` large '' gauge transformations is finite or not .",
    "if it is finite and , therefore , physical then we find a net topological contribution @xmath10 to @xmath2 @xcite @xmath7 the topological term @xmath10 has support only at @xmath68 .",
    "terms in deep inelastic structure functions are also found in regge theory where they are induced by regge fixed poles with non - polynomial residue @xcite . ]",
    "topological @xmath68 polarization is inacessible to polarized deep inelastic scattering experiments which measure @xmath70 between some small but finite value @xmath71 and an upper value @xmath72 which is close to one .",
    "as we decrease @xmath73 we measure the first moment @xmath74 this means that the singlet axial charge which is extracted from polarized deep inelastic scattering is the combination @xmath75 .",
    "in contrast , elastic @xmath76 exchange processes such as @xmath12 elastic scattering measure the full @xmath2 .",
    "one can , in principle , measure the topology term @xmath10 by comparing the flavour - singlet axial charges which are extracted from polarized deep inelastic and @xmath12 elastic scattering experiments .",
    "a decisive measurement of @xmath12 elastic scattering may be possible with the miniboone set - up at fnal @xcite .",
    "one of the most challenging problems in particle physics is to understand the transition between the fundamental qcd `` current '' quarks and gluons and the constituent quarks of low - energy qcd .",
    "relativistic constituent - quark pion coupling models predict @xmath77 ( the ozi value and twice the value of @xmath6 in eq.(1 ) ) .",
    "if some fraction of the spin of the constituent quark is carried by gluon topology in qcd , then the constituent quark model predictions for @xmath2 are not necessarily in contradiction with the small value of @xmath6 extracted from deep inelastic scattering experiments .    the quark total angular momentum @xmath78 measured through the proton matrix of the angular momentum tensor in qcd can , in principle , be extracted from deeply virtual compton scattering @xcite .",
    "this @xmath78 is anomaly free in both perturbative and non - perturbative qcd @xcite .",
    "this means that the axial anomaly cancels between the intrinsic and orbital contributions to @xmath78 .",
    "furthermore , any zero - mode contributions to the `` quark intrinsic spin '' associated with @xmath2 are cancelled by zero - mode contributions to the `` quark orbital angular momentum '' , which is measured by the proton matrix element of @xmath79(0)$ ] .",
    "future measurements of `` quark orbital angular momentum '' from dvcs should be quoted with respect to the factorization scheme and process ( polarized deep inelastic scattering or @xmath12 elastic scattering ) used to extract information about the `` intrinsic spin '' .",
    "the presence or absence of topological @xmath68 polarization is intimately related to the dynamics of @xmath1 symmetry breaking in qcd .",
    "a key issue in dynamical @xmath1 symmetry breaking is the role of instantons . whether instantons spontaneously @xcite or explicitly @xcite break @xmath1 symmetry depends on the role of zero - modes in the quark - instanton interaction and how one should include non - local structure into the local anomalous ward identity , eq .",

    "as we now explain the two choices lead to different phenomenology .",
    "quark instanton interactions flip quark `` chirality '' so that when we time average over multiple scattering on an ensemble of instantons and anti - instantons the spin asymmetry measured in polarized deep inelastic scattering is reduced relative to the asymmetry one would measure if instantons were not important .",
    "topological @xmath68 polarization is natural @xcite in the spontaneous symmetry breaking scenario where any instanton induced suppression of @xmath6 is compensated by a shift of flavour - singlet axial - charge from partons carrying finite momentum @xmath81 to a zero - mode at @xmath68 so that the total @xmath2 is conserved .",
    "it is not generated by the explicit symmetry breaking scenario where the total @xmath2 ( rather than the chirality measured by @xmath30 ) is sensitive to the quark - instanton interaction . comparing the values of @xmath2",
    "extracted from @xmath12 elastic and polarized deep inelastic scattering could provide valuable information on @xmath1 symmetry breaking in qcd .     and @xmath82 .",
    "motivated by the flavour - singlet goldberger - treiman relation ( 3 ) , further insight into the relationship between the proton s internal spin structure and @xmath1 dynamics may come from studying possible ozi violation in the @xmath0nucleon system .    working with the @xmath1extended chiral lagrangian for low - energy qcd @xcite",
    "one finds a gluon - induced contact interaction in the @xmath83 reaction close to threshold @xcite : @xmath84 here @xmath85 is the gluonic contribution to the mass of the singlet 0@xmath86 boson and @xmath10 is a second ozi violating coupling which also features in @xmath87 scattering .",
    "the physical interpretation of the contact term ( 22 ) is a `` short distance '' ( @xmath88fm ) interaction where glue is excited in the interaction region of the proton - proton collision and then evolves to become an @xmath0 in the final state .",
    "this gluonic contribution to the cross - section for @xmath83 is extra to the contributions associated with meson exchange models @xcite .",
    "there is no reason , a priori , to expect it to be small .    since glue is flavour - blind the contact interaction ( 22 ) has the same size in both the @xmath83 and @xmath89 reactions .",
    "celsius @xcite have measured the ratio @xmath90 for quasifree @xmath91 production from a deuteron target up to 100 mev above threshold .",
    "they observed that @xmath92 is approximately energy - independent @xmath93 over the whole energy range  see fig.1 .",
    "the value of this ratio signifies a strong isovector exchange contribution to the @xmath91 production mechanism @xcite .",
    "this experiment should be repeated for @xmath0 production .",
    "the cross - section for @xmath83 close to threshold has been measured at cosy @xcite .",
    "following the suggestion in @xcite new experiments @xcite at cosy have been initiated to carry out the @xmath89 measurement .",
    "the more important that the gluon - induced process ( 22 ) is in the @xmath83 reaction the more one would expect @xmath94 to approach unity near threshold after we correct for the final state interaction @xcite between the two outgoing nucleons .",
    "( after we turn on the quark masses , the small @xmath95 mixing angle @xmath96 degrees means that the gluonic effect ( 22 ) should be considerably bigger in @xmath0 production than @xmath91 production . )",
    "@xmath0 phenomenology is characterised by large ozi violations .",
    "it is natural to expect large gluonic effects in the @xmath83 process .",
