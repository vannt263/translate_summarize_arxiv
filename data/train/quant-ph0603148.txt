    "quantum information processing ( qip ) offers several advantages over classical computation in solving problems associated with large and/or dynamical systems .",
    "one of the main goals of current research in the field is to find ways and means of reliably transmitting quantum information , encoded in quantum bits ( or _ qubits _ ) , over arbitrarily large distances . in order to ensure the information",
    "is received as the sender intended , the qubits must be protected from interacting with the environment in any way .",
    "for this reason , until now the qubits of choice have mostly been photons , which have an extremely small interaction cross section and can thus be used to generate quantum states that are sufficiently robust to perform protocols such as quantum cryptography and teleportation ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , in recent years much effort has been dedicated to studying systems in which quantum information is encoded in _",
    "stationary _ qubits , and is propagated from one part of the system to another by the interaction between the system s components .",
    "one of the simplest geometries in which this can be achieved is a one - dimensional chain of interacting particles , where the qubit is encoded in some internal degree of freedom ( which we call ` spin ' , using @xmath0 for spin ` up ' and @xmath1 for spin ` down ' ) .",
    "originally an exchange - coupled chain of spins with a constant nearest - neighbour ( nn ) interaction was studied @xcite ; it was found that a qubit could be transferred with a fidelity exceeding the maximum classical value in a time that grows polynomially with the length of the chain .",
    "subsequently , it was shown that such simple chains allow transmission fidelities arbitrarily close to unity also if the qubit is taken to be a carefully designed ` wave packet ' , provided the sending and receiving parties can access a sufficiently large portion of the chain @xcite .",
    "stronger results can be found for more complex systems : in the absence of structural imperfections , an xy hamiltonian on a hyper - cubic lattice allows perfect state transfer @xcite , as does a pair of parallel spin chains @xcite , or a spin chain acting as a quantum wire connecting two qubits @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite have studied the situation for chains of harmonic oscillators ( i.e. where each particle on the lattice possesses a continuous , rather than a discrete , degree of freedom ) , while hartmann _",
    "_ @xcite have recently found that quantum information can be made to propagate with arbitrarily high fidelity through both oscillator and spin chains near a quantum phase transition , provided the ground state and the lowest excited state of the system are not degenerate .",
    "however , this transfer is exponentially slow ; more rapid transmission is possible at the quantum critical point , but at some cost to the fidelity .",
    "it has also been shown that high fidelities can be attained by engineering the strength and the nature of the interactions between the spins @xcite .",
    "however , this requires structures that would be very difficult to manufacture , both because the communicating parties would need to have an extremely high degree of control over the system , and because the component spins would have to exhibit nn couplings only , with precisely defined strengths .",
    "this is clearly an idealization , because long - range interactions are also likely to be present .",
    "previous work has been dedicated to systems more ` realistic ' from this point of view .",
    "et al . _ have studied finite spin chains in which the total hamiltonian accounts for the presence of local magnetic fields and a potential of the form of the magnetic dipole interaction @xcite .",
    "the approach adopted in this case was to pre - determine a spectrum of eigenvalues that would ensure perfect state transfer for all chain lengths , and subsequently derive the corresponding local fields and the inter - spin distances by solving an inverse eigenvalue problem .",
    "this method is applicable to a hamiltonian containing any number of parameters , and could provide very useful theoretical guidelines on the optimal way to structure a system , although , once again , the gap between theory and experiment may prove difficult to bridge .    in this work ,",
    "by contrast , we investigate simple one - dimensional arrays of spins interacting via a pure magnetic dipole interaction .",
    "we allow no site - specific locally - tunable fields ; nevertheless , we show that fidelities for quantum state transfer closely approaching unity can be attained between the ends of finite chains , without any special engineering of the system .",
    "furthermore , because of the long range interaction , the transfer rate grows polynomially in the system size , rather than exponentially , as in the case studied by hartmann _",
    "our results may be relevant to two - level atoms in atomic traps @xcite or to one - dimensional arrays of endohedral fullerene species encapsulated within carbon nanotubes @xcite , as well as to natural magnetic dipolar systems such as @xmath2 @xcite , and finite spin chains of a more complex design , for example engineered from arrays of quantum dots @xcite .",
    "we build on the work done by bose @xcite on transferring quantum information through an infinite , uniform chain exhibiting isotropic nn interactions only . in this system ,",
    "the qubit is represented by a single flipped spin , which propagates between different sites in a manner defined by a time - independent hamiltonian of the form : @xmath3 where _ n _ is the number of spins in the chain , @xmath4 are the pauli spin matrices for the @xmath5 spin , @xmath6 is a uniform magnetic field , and @xmath7 is the coupling strength between spins _",
    "i _ and _ j _ , which is non - zero for nearest - neighbouring spins only .",
    "if the ground state of the system is expressed as @xmath8 , it has been shown that , provided the chain is sufficiently short , perfect or near perfect state transfer can be achieved by simply letting an initial state of the form @xmath9 evolve naturally in time according to the effects of * h*. it is important to note that @xmath10 = 0 $ ] , that is , the hamiltonian conserves the total magnetization * m * of the system , allowing the chosen initial state to evolve only into states in which _",
    "one _ spin is flipped at any given time .",
    "we propose to investigate the quality and efficiency of quantum state transfer through infinite and finite chains of spin-@xmath11 fermions coupled by long - range interactions having the form of the magnetic dipole interaction .",
    "these two systems differ in that the finite chain has end points , whereas the infinite chain does not ; indeed , due to the periodic nature of the infinite chain we will hereafter refer to it as a _",
    "ring_. we examine a simplified system in which any external magnetic field is constant and parallel to the axis joining the dipoles , which is chosen to coincide with the _ z _ direction .",
    "the alignment of the magnetic and dipole axes is not a trivial point , but a necessary condition to ensure that the total magnetization * m * remains a good quantum number , and allows us to work in the sub - space where only one spin is flipped with respect to the ground state , reducing the hamiltonian from a @xmath12 to a @xmath13 matrix . within this subspace",
    "the effect of the magnetic field is to add a constant to the energies .",
    "we will hereafter omit this constant . following the notation used in @xcite",
    ", we denote with @xmath14 the ( unique ) ground state of the system ( i.e. all spins facing down , parallel to the external field ) and with @xmath15 the block of states in which the spin at the @xmath16 site has been flipped from 0 to 1 . for simplicity , we assume there are no thermally excited spin - flips in the system .",
    "we adopt a hamiltonian of the form : @xmath17\\ ] ] where _ c _ is a constant , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the total spin operators at sites _",
    "i _ and _ j _ , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the respective _ z _ components .",
    "the value of _ c _ is determined by the type of particle in the chain . for a system of spin-@xmath11 fermions ( e.g. electrons ) _",
    "c _ is given by : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the permeability of free space , @xmath24 is the bohr magneton , _ g _ is the electronic land g - factor and @xmath25 . throughout this paper",
    "we will assume that @xmath26 , so that : @xmath27 we define _ a _ to be the spacing between neighbouring fermions .",
    "in this case , the strength of the interaction between nearest neighbours is : @xmath28 for the results shown we define our length , energy and time units by setting the nearest - neighbour separation and the interaction energy between nearest neighbours to unity .",
    "however , eqn.([eqnnint ] ) implies the hamiltonian has an overall scaling factor of @xmath29 , so a uniform compression or expansion of the system should only have the _ quantitative _ effect of re - scaling the system s energy by a constant .",
    "therefore , provided the chain remains uniform and the number of component spins is fixed , the energy and performance of a chain of any size can be extrapolated by simply adjusting the value of _ a _ as necessary .",
    "we initially consider a ring of _ n _ spins in its ground state .",
    "our aim is to calculate the maximum fidelity of transmission of a qubit from site _",
    "r _ to a distant site _ s _",
    ", as a function of time and number of spins in the ring .",
    "we denote the initial and final states of the system by @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively .",
    "the expression for the maximum fidelity of quantum state transfer is given by @xcite as : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the propagator , which is calculated from the following : @xmath34 we assume that the eigenvectors @xmath35 of the system can be expanded using the basis formed by the @xmath36 states . imposing periodic boundary conditions allows us to express these eigenstates as bloch states , so that for a ring of circumference @xmath37 : @xmath38 the propagator can then be re - expressed as : @xmath39 using eqn .",
    "( [ eqkexpansion ] ) , we calculate the energies of the system , which can be written as : @xmath40 we require only matrix elements for which @xmath41 , since by symmetry the diagonal terms of @xmath42 are independent of _ n _ , and therefore change the energy of the system by a constant shift . for evenly spaced spins with nearest - neighbour separation _ a _ ,",
    "these off - diagonal terms are : @xmath43 , we can reduce the double summation to a single sum over _ j _ by fixing a value of _ i_. for convenience we choose @xmath44 , so that : @xmath45    fig .",
    "[ mfr ] shows the maximum fidelity of state transfer for rings of @xmath46 to @xmath47 spins , when the sending and receiving parties are located at diametrically opposite sites , for which @xmath48 and @xmath49 or @xmath50 for even and odd _",
    "n _ respectively . we have assumed that transfer occurs along the arc joining sites _",
    "r _ and _ s _ , though this may not be exactly the case .",
    "[ mfr ] also shows the performance of a ring in which the spins are coupled by nn interactions only .",
    "we note that for @xmath51 the performance of the nn - coupled ring is slightly better unless @xmath52 or @xmath53 .",
    "we also find that the times of optimum transfer tend to rise as we increase _",
    "n _ in both the dipole and the nn - coupled rings .",
    "we now extend the previous analysis to a finite chain , calculating the full hamiltonian of the system , which has the form : @xmath54 @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the ground state energy of the system .",
    "the fidelity of state transfer between the ends of the chain is obtained by taking @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "we find that @xmath59 exhibits three ` trademark ' features .    .",
    "units are as specified in section [ the system].,width=264 ]     + first of all , the maximum value of @xmath60 is close to unity . secondly , the value of @xmath59 oscillates between 1/2 and the maximum ( which we call @xmath61 ) with a regular frequency , which is generally quite small , implying that state transfer occurs slowly ( fig .",
    "[ nine ] ) .",
    "finally , the period of oscillation of @xmath59 , which we call _ t _ , is uniquely defined by the energy splitting @xmath62 between the two lowest eigenvalues of @xmath63 .",
    "the transfer process is therefore dominated by the beating of two nearly degenerate states localized near the ends of the chain .",
    "this behaviour is explained by the variation of the on - site energies of the spins as a function of _ j _ , shown in fig .",
    "[ diagelnine ] ; it is immediately evident that the most favourable positions for a spin to flip are sites 1 and _ n_. consequently , states @xmath1 and @xmath64 are the most strongly coupled to the system s ( two ) bound states , which are shown in fig .  [ spectrum ] . in this system , this phenomenon is a natural consequence of the geometry , but systems in which the spin flip energy is specifically chosen site by site have also been studied @xcite .",

    "n_.    a summary of our results for @xmath70 to @xmath71 spins is shown in fig .",
    "we note that , in addition to @xmath70 , @xmath46 and @xmath72 also give perfect transfer , and in general @xmath73 .",
    "this is a marked improvement on the performance of a nn - coupled chain ( also shown in fig .",
    "[ mfch ] ) ; in particular , it seems that by replacing the nn couplings with dipole couplings we no longer obtain poor transfer when _ n _ is a multiple of 3 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , we again observe a ` trade - off ' between fidelity and time , which becomes particularly evident for @xmath74 .",
    "in fact , we find that at large _",
    "n _ , @xmath75 goes as the cube of the chain length ( fig .",
    "[ timech ] ) .",
    "it is therefore evident that in long chains it will take an impractical length of time to complete the protocol unless the system can be optimized in some way .",
    "we now analyze the efficiency of state transfer for a _ fixed _ chain length , as a function of the number of spins in the chain .",
    "we define @xmath76 as the transmission time giving maximum fidelity at unit chain length , i.e. : @xmath77fig .",
    "[ normtimech ] shows a plot of @xmath76 as a function of _ n _ , which reveals two interesting features .",
    "the first is the presence of a minimum at @xmath72 , which we will discuss subsequently .",
    "the second is the fact that @xmath76 tends to a constant at large _",
    "l_. this indicates that , above a certain threshold value of _ n _ , the evolution of the system is determined almost exclusively by the magnetic dipole coupling between spins 1 to _ q _ with spins @xmath78 to _ n _ , irrespective of the number of spins that separate these two ` clumps ' .     as a function of the number of spins in the chain .",
    "note the minimum at @xmath72 and the flatness of the curve for @xmath79 .",

    "n _ , we work with states @xmath80 and @xmath81 localized at the beginning and end of the chain , which are the bound - state eigenfunctions of a semi - infinite chain extending to the right and the left , respectively .",
    "we take : latexmath:[\\[\\label{eqb }    latexmath:[\\[\\label{eqe }    splitting of the two lowest eigenvalues of @xmath63 in a finite chain is : @xmath83 from ( [ eqoffdiag ] ) : @xmath84 hence : @xmath85 we adopt a ` dummy ' variable @xmath86 , so that : @xmath87 @xmath88 using ( [ eqtaylor ] ) and the fact that @xmath89 , we can expand @xmath90 as a taylor series to first order in @xmath91 . then : @xmath92 hence : @xmath93\\\\ & = & \\frac{c}{2 } \\left[\\frac{q}{l^3 } + \\frac{ar}{l^4}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with : @xmath94 @xmath95        we find it is possible to model the asymptotic behaviour of the system very accurately if we assign to the coefficients @xmath96 the amplitudes of the ground state eigenvector of the @xmath97 sub - matrix generated by truncating the full hamiltonian @xmath63 for an arbitrarily large _",
    "[ totfit ] ) .",
    "the values of @xmath96 used to obtain the fit in fig .",
    "[ totfit ] come from the ground state eigenvector of the @xmath98 sub - matrix of @xmath99 , and give @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "these quantities show only a very weak dependence on _ n _ , so we have assumed them to be constants .",
    "the fact that @xmath102 shows that the transfer rate for chains of _ many _ spins is always less than that attained between two completely isolated spins ; equation ( [ eqnq ] ) indicates this is a result of interference between positive and negative components in the localized states @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "therefore , only chains with _ few _ spins can improve on the performance of a simple dipole pair , as shown by the minimum in the function @xmath105 at @xmath72 ( fig .",
    "[ normtimech ] ) .",
    "this result , together with fig .",
    "[ mfch ] , shows that , in a _ uniform _ chain , the best compromise between the quality and the speed of the communication is obtained with 4 spins .",
    "this occurs because for short chains the bound states at the two ends have a large overlap , i.e. there exist terms in eqn .",
    "( [ eqtaylor ] ) which simultaneously have significant positive values of @xmath106 and small values of @xmath107 .",
    "we have attempted to optimize the uniform 4-spin chain still further , and find it is possible to improve its performance slightly by modifying the positions of the inner spins while maintaining mirror symmetry . for a chain of unit length",
    ", this corresponds to taking @xmath108 and @xmath109 , which yield a value @xmath110 .",
    "however , a comparison with @xmath111 for a uniform chain ( @xmath112 ) shows the improvement is minimal .",
    "we now investigate the effects of altering the initial and final states @xmath30 and @xmath113 , while leaving the structure of the chain intact .     to an output state of the form @xmath114 in a uniform chain of 10 dipole - dipole coupled spins . comparing with fig .",
    "[ nine ] , note that the curve is smoother and the maximum fidelity has increased .",
    "units are as specified in section [ the system ] . ,",
    "width=302 ]     + if the starting and ending points are chosen at random , the characteristic oscillation of @xmath115 is lost , unless either @xmath116 and @xmath58 , or @xmath57 and @xmath117 . however , in both cases the signal is considerably noisier , and the maximum fidelity is greatly reduced .",
    "this is a result of the lesser efficiency of coupling to the bound states as one moves away from the ends of the chain ( cfr .",
    "[ spectrum ] ) .",
    "conversely , it is possible to boost the maximum fidelity to unity and smooth out all noise in the signal by encoding the states @xmath118 and @xmath113 in two or more adjacent spins(fig .",
    "[ superposnine ] ) .",
    "this is equivalent to adopting @xmath119 and @xmath120 , where the @xmath96 are now obtained from the first and last _ n _ coefficients of the ground state eigenvector of @xmath63 , with the additional condition that @xmath121 .",
    "this choice of input and output states leaves the transfer time unaffected .",
    "we present a scheme for transferring quantum information through infinite and finite chains of spins coupled via a pure magnetic dipole interaction .",
    "this differs from much previous work in that the dipole interaction is long - range , making for a system in which every spin interacts with all other spins in the system , rather than with nearest neighbours only .",
    "we find that , in general , the maximum fidelity achievable by using a dipole - coupled system to transfer a state between two maximally distant sites is greater or equal to that which can be attained in a system exhibiting nearest - neighbour interactions only .",
    "the _ finite _ chain , in particular , can be engineered to give unit fidelity by simply adjusting the placement of the spins and the input and output states .",
    "we have verified this result only for @xmath122 to @xmath123 , but believe it extends to longer chains also .",
    "the main weakness of both our systems is length of time taken to complete the protocol , which increases polynomially in the size of the system .",
    "however , we find that for a finite chain this obstacle can be considerably lessened by simply modifying the relative placement of the spins .",
    "therefore , it does not necessarily preclude the possibility of being able to transmit information over longer distances on useful timescales .",
    "furthermore , the protocol seems to be reasonably robust against errors in spin placement ; if we define a  failure rate \" as the probability that the fidelity at time @xmath75 will fall below the classical value , we find that , in a uniform 4-spin chain of arbitrary length , a random error of 2 % on the placement of each spin yields a failure rate of approximately 5 % .",
    "the corresponding uncertainty on @xmath75 is significantly greater , but as @xmath67 is a slowly varying function of time , it is quite unlikely that the fidelity at @xmath124 will have fallen significantly below the maximum .",
    "therefore , the simple and predictable behaviour of the fidelity in time in a finite chain greatly increases the probability of carrying out successful state transfer .",
    "the long range interactions also open up the realistic possibility of measurements on individual spins , and it would be interesting to investigate in the future whether this can increase the speed of quantum state transfer as in ref .  @xcite .",
