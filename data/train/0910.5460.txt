    "statistical mechanics is a rich source of fascinating phenomena that can be , at least in principle , fully understood in terms of probability theory . over the last two decades",
    ", probabilists have tackled this challenge with much success .",
    "notable examples include percolation theory @xcite , interacting particle systems @xcite , and most recently , conformal invariance .",
    "our focus here is on another area of statistical mechanics , the theory of gibbs measures , which provides a very effective and flexible way to define collections of ` locally dependent ' random variables .",
    "the general abstract theory of gibbs measures is fully rigorous from a mathematical point of view @xcite .",
    "however , when it comes to understanding the properties of specific gibbs measures , i.e. of specific models , a large gap persists between physicists heuristic methods and the scope of mathematically rigorous techniques .",
    "this paper is devoted to somewhat non - standard , family of models , namely gibbs measures on sparse random graphs .",
    "classically , statistical mechanics has been motivated by the desire to understand the physical behavior of materials , for instance the phase changes of water under temperature change , or the permeation or oil in a porous material .",
    "this naturally led to three - dimensional models for such phenomena .",
    "the discovery of ` universality ' ( i.e. the observation that many qualitative features do not depend on the microscopic details of the system ) , led in turn to the study of models on three - dimensional lattices , whereby the elementary degrees of freedom ( spins ) are associated with the vertices of of the lattice .",
    "thereafter , @xmath0-dimensional lattices ( typically @xmath1 ) , became the object of interest upon realizing that significant insight can be gained through such a generalization .",
    "the study of statistical mechanics models ` beyond @xmath1 ' is not directly motivated by physics considerations .",
    "nevertheless , physicists have been interested in models on other graph structures for quite a long time ( an early example is @xcite ) .",
    "appropriate graph structures can simplify considerably the treatment of a specific model , and sometimes allow for sharp predictions .",
    "hopefully some qualitative features of this prediction survive on @xmath1 .",
    "recently this area has witnessed significant progress and renewed interest as a consequence of motivations coming from computer science , probabilistic combinatorics and statistical inference . in these disciplines ,",
    "one is often interested in understanding the properties of ( optimal ) solutions of a large set of combinatorial constraints . as a typical example , consider a linear system over gf@xmath2 $ ] , @xmath3 mod @xmath4 , with @xmath5 an @xmath6 binary matrix and @xmath7 a binary vector of length @xmath8 .",
    "assume that @xmath5 and @xmath7 are drawn from random matrix / vector ensemble .",
    "typical questions are : what is the probability that such a linear system admits a solution ? assuming a typical realization does not admit a solution , what is the maximum number of equations that can , typically , be satisfied ?    while probabilistic combinatorics developed a number of ingenious techniques to deal with these questions , significant progress has been achieved recently by employing novel insights from statistical physics ( see @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , one first defines a gibbs measure associated to each instance of the problem at hand , then analyzes its properties using statistical physics techniques , such as the cavity method . while non - rigorous , this approach appears to be very systematic and to provide many sharp predictions .",
    "it is clear at the outset that , for ` natural ' distributions of the binary matrix @xmath5 , the above problem does not have any @xmath0-dimensional structure .",
    "similarly , in many interesting examples , one can associate to the gibbs measure a graph that is sparse and random , but of no finite - dimensional structure .",
    "non - rigorous statistical mechanics techniques appear to provide detailed predictions about general gibbs measures of this type",
    ". it would be highly desirable and in principle possible to develop a fully mathematical theory of such gibbs measures .",
    "the present paper provides a unified presentation of a few results in this direction .    in the rest of this section",
    ", we proceed with a more detailed overview of the topic , proposing certain fundamental questions the answer to which plays an important role within the non - rigorous statistical mechanics analysis .",
    "we illustrate these questions on the relatively well - understood curie - weiss ( toy ) model and explore a few additional motivating examples .",
    "section [ ch : isingchapter ] focuses on a specific example , namely the ferromagnetic ising model on sequences of locally tree - like graphs .",
    "thanks to its monotonicity properties , detailed information can be gained on this model .",
    "a recurring prediction of statistical mechanics studies is that bethe - peierls approximation is asymptotically tight in the large graph limit , for sequences of locally tree - like graphs .",
    "section [ ch : bethe ] provides a mathematical formalization of bethe - peierls approximation .",
    "we also prove there that , under an appropriate correlation decay condition , bethe - peierls approximation is indeed essentially correct on graphs with large girth .",
    "in section [ chap : coloring ] we consider a more challenging , and as of now , poorly understood , example : proper colorings of a sparse random graph .",
    "a fascinating ` clustering ' phase transition is predicted to occur as the average degree of the graph crosses a certain threshold . whereas the detailed description and verification of this phase transition remains an open problem ,",
    "its relation with the appropriate notion of correlation decay ( ` extremality ' ) , is the subject of section [ ch : reco ] .    finally , it is common wisdom in statistical mechanics that phase transitions should be accompanied by a specific ` finite - size scaling ' behavior .",
    "more precisely , a phase transition corresponds to a sharp change in some property of the model when a control parameter crosses a threshold . in a finite system ,",
    "the dependence on any control parameter is smooth , and the change and takes place in a window whose width decreases with the system size .",
    "finite - size scaling broadly refers to a description of the system behavior within this window .",
    "section [ ch : xorsat ] presents a model in which finite - size scaling can be determined in detail .",
    "the curie - weiss model is deceivingly simple , but is a good framework to start illustrating some important ideas . for a detailed study of this model",
    "we refer to @xcite .      at time zero , each of @xmath8 individuals takes one of two opinions @xmath9 independently and uniformly at random for @xmath10 = \\{1,\\dots , n\\}$ ] . at each subsequent time @xmath11 ,",
    "one individual @xmath12 , chosen uniformly at random , computes the opinion imbalance @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "then , he / she changes his / her opinion with probability @xmath15 despite its simplicity , this model raises several interesting questions .    1 .",

    "* proof of theorem 2.3 ) all moments of @xmath240 are finite and the proof is thus completed by a first order taylor expansion of @xmath2185 in ( [ eq : third ] ) around @xmath2186 .    [ rem : accuracy ] the simulations in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 2 ) suggest that the approximation of @xmath2123 we provide in ( [ eq : mainresult ] ) is more accurate than the @xmath2187 correction term suggests .",
    "our proof shows that one can not hope for a better error estimate than @xmath2100 as we neglect the second order term in expanding @xmath2188 , see ( [ eq : third ] ) .",
    "we believe this is indeed the order of the next term in the expansion ( [ eq : mainresult ] ) . determining its form is an open problem .",
    "[ rem : emergence ] consider the ( time ) evolution of the core for the hyper - graph process where one hyper - edge is added uniformly at random at each time step .",
    "that is , @xmath8 increases with time , while the number of vertices @xmath225 is kept fixed .",
    "let @xmath2189 be the corresponding ( random ) number of hyper - edges in the core of the hyper - graph at time @xmath8 and @xmath2190 the onset of a non - empty core .",
    "recall that small cores are absent for a typical large random hyper - graph , whereas fixing @xmath2078 the probability of an empty core , i.e. @xmath2191 , decays in @xmath225 .",
    "thus , for large @xmath225 most trajectories @xmath2192 abruptly jump from having no core for @xmath2193 to a linear in @xmath225 core size at the random critical edge number @xmath2194 . by the monotonicity of @xmath2189",
    "we further see that @xmath2195 , hence theorem [ thm : main ] determines the asymptotic distribution of @xmath2194 . indeed ,",

    "* remark 2.5 ) , upon expressing @xmath8 in terms of @xmath225 in equation ( [ eq : mainresult ] ) we find that the distributions of @xmath2196 converge point - wise to the standard normal law at a rate which is faster than @xmath2197 .",
    "[ rem : size ] the same techniques are applicable for other properties of the core in the ` scaling regime ' @xmath2198 .",
    "for example , as shown in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 2.6 ) , for @xmath2199 and conditional to the existence of a non - empty core , @xmath2200 converges in distribution as @xmath71 to @xmath2201 where @xmath2202 is a non - degenerate random variable ( whose density is explicitly provided there ) .",
    "in particular , the @xmath2203 fluctuations of the core size at fixed @xmath2078 are enhanced to @xmath2204 fluctuations near the critical point .",
