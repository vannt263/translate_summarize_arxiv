    "at mount wilson observatory ( mwo ) the ca ii h ( 396.8 nm ) and k ( 393.4 nm ) emission fluxes have been observed as a proxy for surface magnetism since 1966 in many lower main sequence stars . since 1980",
    ", observations have been obtained several times per week over periods as long as several months .",
    "these densely - sampled records are suited for studying changes in the pattern of the ca ii chromospheric radiative losses on timescales of days to months ( baliunas et al . 1995 ) .",
    "we present results from a new wavelet - type analysis of the ca ii records for four stars with higher mean ca ii emission fluxes and faster or comparable mean rotation than the sun : hd 1835 , 82885 , 149661 and 190007 ( table 1 ) .",
    "the records of those four stars were chosen as a starting point for complementary , upcoming studies , with e. smith , a. vaughan and colleagues at the jet propulsion laboratory , that seek to understand phenomena linked to persistent magnetic structures on the sun .",
    "theoretical results ( schssler et al . 1996 ; deluca , fan & saar 1997 ) suggest that such active , rapidly rotating stars should show magnetic flux tubes in limited latitude zones which may facilitate the persistent clustering of surface features ( see e.g. , seiden & wentzel 1996 ; ruzmaikin 1998 for discussion on mechanisms associated with the clustering of emerging magnetic fluxes on the sun ) .",
    "these few stars were noted to as showing long - lived ca ii emitting regions in an earlier analysis of the then shorter mwo records ( vaughan & baliunas 1992 ; see also noyes 1982 ) .",
    "but the present wavelet analysis constitutes two pragmatical improvements over the previous analysis .",
    "first , the length of the records has nearly doubled .",
    "second , in contrast to the previous fourier transform technique , no apriori assumption needs to be made concerning the ca ii rotational modulation with time . since this is an exploratory effort meant to examine the suitability of the technique we derive no information on how common or uncommon the results on long - lived surface ca ii features are among the stars in the entire mwo database .",
    "that task will be taken up in the future .",
    "because of mathematical refinements of the wavelet transform ( i.e. , self - similarity of the wavelet basis function , time - frequency localization ) , it has become increasingly popular as a tool for extracting local - frequency information ( e.g. , farge 1992 ; kumar & foufoula - georgiou 1997 ) .",
    "the wavelet transform differs from traditional fourier analysis because of its ability to efficiently detect multi - scale , non - stationary processes .",
    "we applied a newly introduced _",
    "wavelet algorithm ( frick et al . 1997 ) to the mwo records of four stars to study time variations of rotational modulation of the ca ii fluxes .",
    "the algorithm alleviates two constraints in stellar activity records that complicate traditional methods of period analysis : limited duration and sampling gaps .",
    "this goal is achieved by fine correction ( adaptation ) of the wavelet for a given time and frequency while still satisfying the admissibility condition ( for which the mean value of the wavelet must be zero : @xmath2 ) .",
    "the admissibility condition can be broken when the wavelet overlaps data gaps in or the edges of data series .    in this analysis",
    "we use the morlet wavelet with an adjustable parameter , @xmath3 , which can be fine - tuned to yield optimal resolutions of time and frequency : @xmath4 in that case , the resolutions of the wavelet for a given characteristic time - scale , @xmath5 , are : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a constant of order unity .",
    "small values of @xmath3 give better time resolution while large values of @xmath3 improve frequency resolution . the key step in any application of the wavelet transform",
    "is to deduce the optimum trade - off between frequency and time resolution and the art is to choose @xmath3 carefully so that it fits the physical phenomena of interest .",
    "the commonly adopted value of @xmath3 is 1 ; the limit @xmath8 corresponds to the fourier transform .",
    "but the choice of @xmath3 is highly restricted by the admissibility condition , @xmath9 , so that only a finite range and discrete values of @xmath3 are allowed . under the application of the standard morlet wavelet algorithm , the admissibility condition breaks down when @xmath3 is below unity because the real parts of the morlet wavelet do not vanish .",
    "in contrast , because of the renormalization performed in the gapped wavelet algorithm , that problem is avoided automatically and a wide range of @xmath3 ( provided @xmath3 is not too small ) can be used .",
    "we examine two aspects of stellar variability in the records : ( i ) the presence of any dominant surface magnetic features and signatures of rotating features ; ( ii ) the nature of time variations of any dominant rotational signals .",
    "results are presented for a wide range of @xmath3 and illustrate that aspect ( i ) is best studied with lower values of @xmath3 while ( ii ) is more optimally addressed with larger values .",
    "the mwo time series of ca ii emission fluxes are assumed to be a superposition of short - lived oscillations with random , initial phases and individual frequencies , which have a mean value , @xmath10 ( or period , assumed to be rotation , @xmath11 ) and characteristic width , @xmath12 .",
    "the choice for time - frequency resolution is set by two factors : the typical time of an individual oscillation and the band width , @xmath12 .",
    "if one is interested in studying variations in frequencies caused by the emergence of fluxes drifting in latitude , a wavelet with @xmath13 on the order of typical lifetime of individual features should be used .    from a detailed analysis of the magnetic flux budget on the sun ,",
    "schrijver & harvey ( 1994 ) deduced that the surface - averaged lifetime of photospheric magnetic flux ( which included contributions from magnetic bipolar and plage regions and other smaller - scale features ) varies from @xmath14 130 days at cycle maximum to 340 days at cycle minimum .",
    "these timescales yield estimates of @xmath3 from about 4 to 10 . for the ca",
    "ii records of young and active stars , the values for @xmath3 may need to be smaller . but small values of @xmath3 produce frequency beating because of reduced wavelet spectral / frequency resolution ( or increased time resolution ) .",
    "we illustrate this phenomenon with two examples .",
    "first , we consider the simple superposition of two harmonic oscillators with nearby frequencies @xmath10 and @xmath15 .",
    "beating arises if the wavelet frequency resolution , @xmath16 @xmath1 @xmath17 . in figure 1a ,",
    "the wavelet power with @xmath18 is shown for the case of two superposed sinusoids with periods 9 and 11 days . the maximum wavelet power for time",
    "@xmath19 displays a beating with characteristic frequency , @xmath20 .",
    "figure 1b shows the modulus of wavelet coefficients for another artificial signal , one which is produced by the superposition of short - lived variations with random phases and frequencies ( 9 @xmath0 @xmath5 @xmath0 11 days ) .",
    "again , the local maxima in wavelet power for each time oscillates around the mean value of the dominant periods . the period of the beating yields an estimate of the average width of a band of frequencies .",
    "the beat frequency , @xmath21 , suggests @xmath22 day , which represents the mean difference between the periods of any two individual oscillations .",
    "figure 1c shows the results from the artificial series of figure 1b analyzed with a larger value of @xmath23 .",
    "the beat phenomenon disappears , and only discrete periods are resolved at a given time interval .",
    "thus , appropriate choices of @xmath3 allow different kinds of information to be extracted .",
    "figure 2 shows the time - averaged wavelet spectra for the four active stars .",
    "table 1 summarizes the values of rotation periods determined from the gapped wavelet technique .",
    "the dominant timescales found here correspond well with results from periodogram analysis ( e.g. , donahue , saar & baliunas 1996 ) .",
    "to study the time variations of the rotation periods , we started the analysis with @xmath24 .",
    "we found significant oscillations of the primary period in the time - frequency plane of the wavelet modulus for each of the records of the four stars .",
    "an example of these oscillations is shown in figure 3a for hd 1835 .",
    "the maxima of wavelet power ( traced by the filled circles ) are themselves a time series , @xmath25 , from which a wavelet spectrum is also calculated .",
    "those spectra for all four stars are shown in figure 3b .",
    "each spectrum displays a pronounced peak corresponding to the main beat frequency , @xmath21 ( table 1 ) .",
    "the test examples suggest that the beat frequency contains information on the range of unresolved frequencies in each record .",
    "the dominant but unresolved periods range from one to a few days , and are also listed in table 1 .",
    "the beat frequency yields an estimate of the characteristic @xmath26 ( table 1 ) , and suggests the choice of a larger @xmath3 that would be useful for studying , e.g. , the change in dominant periods over extended times .",
    "figure 4 shows the time variations of the dominant timescales for each star calculated with optimal wavelet time - frequency resolution .",
    "the values of the wavelet resolution parameter , @xmath3 , are 2.5 , 2.0 , 4.0 , and 4.0 , respectively .",
    "these values were chosen to be about 2.5 times larger than @xmath27 in order to : ( i ) avoid the beat phenomena shown in figure 3 and ( ii ) investigate the relative long - term stability of the dominant peaks in the spectra . figure 4 shows that the dominant rotational periods for hd 1835 , 82885 and 149661 are relatively narrow in range and remarkably stable throughout the full interval of observations .",
    "this pattern of time - frequency localization may be interpreted as recurring ca ii emissions from localized surface features that continued for @xmath1 10 years .",
    "the dominant rotational peaks for hd 190007 seem less localized and it may or may not be dominated by narrowly distributed , persistent or recurring surface features .",
    "the range of each dominant scale is assumed to be the wavelet frequency resolution , @xmath16 ; the values for the records of the four stars are 0.5 , 1.5 , 0.5 , 0.5 days , respectively .",
    "previous analyses of the mwo ca ii records used fourier methods for studying surface rotation and pattern of surface differential rotation ( e.g. , baliunas et al . 1985 ; donahue et al .",
    "two interconnected assumptions were made in those studies : first , that by binning the data series into individual observing seasons ( @xmath28 several months ) , time resolution for studying the underlying rotational modulation is automatically optimum .",
    "second , once any dominant rotational signal is detected , systematic variations with time of the rotation period can be studied by simply considering the change in rotational signal from one seasonal bin to another . because the wavelet transform adopts localized basis function , information on the time dependence of spectral properties is preserved , so it avoids the assumptions used in the fourier studies . however , although the wavelet method provides information on spectral changes with time , there is a practical limit to the physical interpretation of the results because the spatial location of the stellar features is unknown .",
    "that means that proving that rotational time - scales associated with specific surface features are changing with time is difficult .    on the other hand",
    ", one can invert the question and ask if a stationary , rotational signal exists .",
    "this is an easier question to answer because the wavelet method can establish clearly the presence of a persistent signal .",
    "the results in figure 4 suggest that the ca ii emitting regions marking the rotation periods last @xmath1 10 years , for at least two of the four active stars analyzed .",
    "thus , the idea of using the wavelet time - frequency approach to establish stationarity of the rotational signal is a useful strategy in gaining understanding of the surface ca ii activity .",
    "because the ca ii features in hd 1835 and 82885 seem to persist so much longer than lifetime of individual magnetic features ( e.g. , active regions ) on the sun , our results might caution against indiscriminate application of the stellar knowledge to the sun .",
    "this would seem to be a conclusion opposing any hope of applying the solar - stellar connection in a two - way , quantitative manner . on the other hand",
    ", an analysis of sunspot groups from 1940 to 1956 , suggests that there are recurrent clusters of sunspot nests which can persist and keep their rotation rate for up to several years , while at the same time showing systematic meridional drift towards equator with velocity of about 1 m / s ( e.g. , van driel - gesztelyi , van der zalm & zwaan 1992 ) .",
    "those authors also noted that components in large active nests tend to overlap in time with their mean latitudes differing by less than 2.5@xmath29 while the difference in longitude may extend up to 55@xmath29 .",
    "thus , the observed persistence of ca ii features in our active star sample may not be entirely incompatible with characteristics observed on the sun .",

    "we are also grateful for the dedicated efforts of our colleagues , especially mike bradford , laura woodard - eklund , jim frazer and kirk palmer at mount wilson observatory .",
