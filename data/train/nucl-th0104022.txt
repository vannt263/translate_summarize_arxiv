    "as shown in some talks  @xcite of this conference , statistical descriptions work very successfully for multihadron final states in nucleon - nucleon , nucleon - nucleus , and nucleus - nucleus collisions . in this approach",

    "cleymans , oeschler and redlich  @xcite fit them well by a common chemical freezeout at @xmath7 mev and @xmath8 mev in terms of a canonical thermal model .",
    "this is another success of statistical description .",
    "however , it is hard to understand that the chemical freezeout density from these values of @xmath0 and @xmath9 is just @xmath10 where the mean free path is @xmath2 6 fm .",
    "bratkovskaya and cassing s transport calculations in fig .",
    "[ bc ] show that production comes from all densities .",
    "we can understand simply why they are compelled to obtain such a low density . by strangeness conservation",
    "the number of is the sum of the number of and that of @xmath11 and @xmath12 hyperon .",
    "here they are neglected to simplify the discussion .",
    "] we measured /@xmath2 32 in table  [ table:1 ] so @xmath11/@xmath2 31 .",
    "thus if we get the right @xmath11/ratio , /follows .",
    "the ratio is r= = ( ) ^32 ( ) ^32 .[ratio ] if @xmath13 , @xmath14 mev gives @xmath15 280 .",
    "it s too large so they need @xmath8 mev , 190 mev lower than @xmath16 , in order to get the right value of @xmath17 .",
    "that s why they obtained the low density for equilibration with free - space mass hadrons .",
    "a simple way to introduce an in - medium mass is the v - spin formalism in @xcite . in the formalism",
    "we can obtain the kaon effective mass by considering the kaon fields as small fluctuations @xmath18 around the @xmath19 axis as shown in fig .",

    "the hamiltonian for explicit chiral symmetry breaking is h_xsb=_kn<|nn>+12",
    "m_k^2f^2 ^ 2 .",
    "then the effective mass of kaons ( small fluctuation @xmath18 ) comes to drop from movement towards restoration of explicitly broken chiral symmetry ; = 1- with an approximation @xmath20 . taking @xmath21 mev , @xmath22 mev , @xmath23 mev and @xmath24  @xcite , we obtain _",
    "kn=_n~400  .",
    "the effective value of @xmath25 is somewhat smaller by range corrections  @xcite ; ( _ kn)_eff=(1 - 0.37_k^2/m_k^2 ) _ kn where @xmath26 is the self - energy of the antikaon at rest with vector potential @xmath27 .",
    "considering kaon mass shift in medium , we can rewrite @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ ratio ] ) as r= ( ) ^3/2 e^(_b+^_k^-)/te^-m_/t .",
    "we assume that kaon vector potential @xmath27 is proportional to the density below @xmath28 and constant above @xmath28 , because the vector decoupling is expected at high density  @xcite .",
    "as @xmath9 goes from 860 mev to 905 mev , @xmath29 goes from 1.2@xmath28 to 2.1@xmath28 and @xmath30 goes from 1230 to 1227 mev with fixed @xmath31 70 mev . even at @xmath10 @xmath30 is 1245 mev . disregarding the dependence on @xmath32 in the denominator and on t by @xmath32 in the denominator",
    "can be compensated for by increasing @xmath0 . ] for simplicity , we found the ratio @xmath17 is independent of density .",
    "this results can be checked by the recent experimental results .",
    "the ratio /,which is directly related to @xmath11/ , is almost independent of centrality in gsi  @xcite and ags  @xcite experiments . in other words ,",
    "the ratio of hyperon to is roughly the same at all densities .",
    "we call it  broad - band equilibration \" .",
    "so the negatively charged strangeness sector looks well and truly equilibrated within itself .",
    "positively charged strangeness hardly changes as the system expands below 2@xmath28  @xcite .",
    "since the number of positively charged strangeness is the same as that of the negatively charged strangensess , most of the negatively charged strangeness particles will be produced early .",
    "the strong attraction that the experiences in dense matter can make the kaon energy come down to the electron chemical potential and kaons be able to replace electrons .",
    "if the vector decouples in the changeover from nucleons to constituent quarks as variables as we expect , the kaon will condensate before chiral restoration .",
    "the kaon condensation sets the maximum neutron star mass 1.5 @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the observation that all the neutron star masses are below 1.5 @xmath33 , in systems with degenerate companions , where the companion structure should not influence the measurement .",
