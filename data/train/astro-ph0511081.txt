    "ever since the times of hubble & humason ( 1931 ) , observations have shown that the galaxy populations in clusters differ from those in the field .",
    "spitzer & baade ( 1951 ) and gunn & gott ( 1972 ) suggested that dynamical processes within clusters might be responsible for transforming the initial galaxy population .",
    "the discover of the `` morphology - environment '' relationship ( dressler 1980 ) , the `` butcher - oemler effect '' ( butcher & oemler 1978 ) , and more recently the results of the morphs collaboration ( dressler 1997 , poggianti 1999 ) suggest that the environment in cluster of galaxies is responsible for the morphological evolution of galaxies , with spirals becoming lenticular and redder .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed as the cause of this evolution , such as merging ( e.g ; hernquist 1992 , naab & burkert 2003 , van dokkum 1999 ) , icm - ism stripping ( gunn & gott 1972 ; nulsen 1982 ; schulz & struck 2001 ; vollmer 2001 ; van gorkom 2004 , kenney 2004 ) , and high speed tidal interactions ( also called `` harrassment '' moore 1996 ) . however , it is not yet clear which processes are the main drivers of cluster galaxy evolution .",
    "merging has been shown to be important in the formation of large ellipticals such as cd galaxies , boxy and disky elliptical galaxies , and disturbed spirals ( bournaud 2004 ) .",
    "it has been argued that the high relative velocities between galaxies in virialized clusters make merging an unlikely mechanism ( ghigna 1998 ) .",
    "however , mergers can occur in the unrelaxed part of clusters where the local velocity dispersion may be much lower than that within the virialized inner portion .",
    "conversely , icm - ism stripping , would be effective in removing the ism from galaxies in the virialized portion of the cluster .",
    "in fact , under some conditions of icm density and relative velocities , ram pressure stripping could be strong enough as to _ completely _ remove the gas .",
    "high velocity tidal interaction or `` harassment '' ( moore 1996 ) may make faint sc - sd galaxies evolve into dwarf galaxies by tidally removing the stars , although the disks are not completely destroyed ( mastropietro 2004 ) . in the case of sa - sb galaxies ,",
    "their concentrated potential help them maintain their stability under harassment , but this process could disturb their disks and increase the scale height of the stars ( moore 1999 ) . finally , there is recent evidence that galaxy transformation is not only restricted to core of the clusters .",
    "simulations show that sc / sd galaxies under hierarchical growth and galaxy harrassment undergo a significant transformation even in the outskirts of the clusters ( mastropietro 2004 ) .",
    "recent studies find galaxies with reduced star formation far from the centers of some clusters ( e.g. balogh et al 1998 , lewis et al 2002 , gmez et al 2003 , nichol 2004 ) .",
    "solanes ( 2001 ) find hi deficient galaxies located out to 2 abell radii in the virgo cluster .",
    "these may be galaxies that were locally stripped at surprisingly large cluster distances , or stripped in the core then rebounded to large clustercentric distances .",
    "the virgo cluster is the nearest moderately rich cluster ( distance of @xmath7 16 mpc , jacoby 1992 ; freedman 1994 , yielding a scale of 4.6 kpc / arcmin ) , with about 2000 identified galaxies bingelli ( 1987 ) , of which about 110 spirals and lenticulars are brighter than @xmath8 .",
    "virgo has many disturbed and hi - deficient galaxies , making it an ideal place to study in detail the processes that affect galaxy evolution .",
    "the cluster has a significant population of galaxies characterized by truncated star formation morphologies , with no h@xmath1 in the outer disk but strong h@xmath1 in the inner region ( koopmann & kenney , 2004 ) .",
    "most of these `` truncated / normal '' galaxies are consistent with having simply icm - ism stripped disks , but some of them are more peculiar than that .",
    "ngc 4064 and ngc 4424 are the prototypical members of a type of h@xmath1 radial distribution which koopmann & kenney ( 2004 ) describe as `` truncated / compact '' . compared to typical isolated galaxies , ``",
    "truncated / compact '' galaxies have circumnuclear normalized star formation rates enhanced by a factor of at least 5 , and virtually no star formation beyond the central kiloparsec ( koopmann & kenney 2004 ) .",
    "in contrast to truncated / normal galaxies , these truncated / compact galaxies have unusually steep h@xmath1 surface brightness profiles resembling the stellar profile of a `` bulge '' .",
    "these two peculiar 0.25 l@xmath9 virgo cluster spiral galaxies are particularly interesting because they have small bulges , large hi deficiencies , and strong h@xmath1 emission confined to their cores , with bar - like morphologies .",
    "furthermore , one of them , ngc4064 , is located in the outskirts of the cluster , which may suggest that its hi deficiency is the result of environmental effects operating in the outer parts of virgo .",
    "it has been reported that these two galaxies have h@xmath10 rotational gas velocities which are extremely low with respect to other virgo cluster galaxies with roughly the same luminosity ( rubin 1999 ) .",
    "while the galaxies have some similarities , their stellar morphologies differ .",
    "ngc 4064 has an outer stellar disk which contains very open stellar spiral arms but appears relatively undisturbed , whereas ngc 4424 has heart - shaped optical isophotes , shells and complex stellar structures which suggest a merger event ( kenney 1996 ) .    in this paper , we present a detailed studied of the kinematics and morphologies of these two virgo cluster galaxies in the hope of identifying the physical mechanisms responsible for their peculiarities .",
    "we present a comparison between the stellar , ionized gas and molecular gas morphology and kinematics in the form of two - dimensional maps . in  2 , we briefly describe the known properties of these galaxies . in ",
    "3 we present the technical details of our spectroscopic observations as well as those of the co interferometry and optical imaging .",
    "the observational results related to optical morphology , molecular gas morphology , and kinematics , dust morphology , stellar , and ionized gas kinematics are given in  4 .",
    "we then discuss the nature of these objects in  5 , and summarize our results in  6 .",
    "ngc 4064 is a peculiar sb galaxy located 8.8@xmath11 ( 2.5 mpc ) from m87 , in the outskirts of the virgo cluster , and is among the most distant known cluster members .",
    "the optical image shows perturbed dust lanes and a central bar ending in very open spiral arms ( fig .",
    "@xmath12 ) .",
    "h@xmath1 imaging by koopmann ( 2001 ) shows that the h@xmath1 emission is confined to the central kpc .",
    "the h@xmath1 surface brightness in this central region is among the highest in the virgo cluster ( koopmann & kenney 2004 ) .",
    "ngc 4064 has been reported to have low h@xmath1 line - of - sight velocities for its luminosity with @xmath1340 @xmath5 ( rubin 1999 ) , but has a hi linewidth of 163 @xmath5 ( helou 1984 ) consistent with its luminosity .",
    "it has a large hi deficiency of h@xmath14= 1.0 , corresponding to one - tenth the hi for a normal spiral of its luminosity .",

    "ngc 4424 is a peculiar sa galaxy located 3.1@xmath11 ( 870 kpc projected distance ) from m87 .",

    "the galaxy spectra were averaged for improving signal - to - noise and cosmic ray removed .",
    "we derived the two - dimensional stellar velocity field of ngc 4064 and ngc 4424 using the cross - correlation algorithm `` corrfit '' developed by statler ( 1995 ) and based on the classic cross - correlation method developed by tonry & davies ( 1979 ) .",
    "the method cross - correlates the galaxy spectra with the template star spectra , deriving a cross - correlation function which is the convolution between the line of sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) and the auto - correlation function of the template stars .",
    "the losvds is parameterized by a gaussian although a more detailed parameterization is also possible via gauss - hermite functions ( van der marel & franx 1993 ) , but due to low snr we did nt attempt such parameterization .",
    "the spectra were prepared by dividing by the continuum emission , rebining logarithmically , and fourier filtering .",
    "the emission lines were excluded from the cross - correlation , and the template star was chosen as the star which gives the highest cross - correlation peak with the galaxy spectra .",
    "the outcome of the above process was in the form of @xmath23 , @xmath6 maps . due to the low signal - to - noise ratio of the spectra ( @xmath7 40 per pixel in the central fibers , and @xmath7 15 per pixel in the outer fibers ) , the full resolution line - of - sight velocity dispersions maps were noisy . in order to increase the s / n ratio we binned our data using the voronoi 2d binning algorithm of cappellari & copin ( 2003 ) and obtained compact bins with a minimum signal - to - noise ratio of 20 per pixel which yielded line - of - sight velocity dispersions with a error of 10% .",
    "in the case of emission lines ( h@xmath24 ) and oiii ( 5007 a ) , we derived two- dimensional ionized gas velocity maps , by fitting a gaussian function to the emission lines in the continuum subtracted spectra , obtaining @xmath23 and @xmath6 for the ionized gas .",

    "some faint filaments can be identified in our image .",
    "the filaments are roughly perpendicular to the bar on the eastern side , and form an arc on the western side .",
    "these filaments are probably the result of ejection of material from the luminous star forming hii complexes .",

    "the central hii regions of ngc 4424 are not associated with any detected co emission , although this may be a reflection of the overall weaker co emission in ngc  4424 .",
    "the molecular gas in ngc  4064 has highly non - circular motions , with bar - like streaming motions and perhaps shocks .",
    "since the kinematics are somewhat complex , we show channel maps ( in ( fig .",

    "the northern co lobe shows double - peaked line profiles in some locations , with distinct peaks near 930 and 1000 @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "@xmath47 ) the southern lobe shows broad line profiles , some of which have complex shapes , although without clear doubling .",
    "a comparison of the line profiles on the 2 sides of the nucleus shows that the peaks of the broad profiles in the southern lobe are either associated with one the double peaks in the northern lobe , or are located between them ( after reflection about the systemic velocity ) .",
    "the total line widths in the 2 lobes are similar , although a bit larger in the north , with a maximum fwzi of 165 km / s in the north , and 145 km / s in the south .",
    "the double peaked and broad line profiles are likely due to shocks associated with a bar .",
    "a map of intensity - weighted mean velocities in figure @xmath36 shows a well - ordered velocity field , with nearly symmetric behavior in the 2 lobes , and strong non - circular motions ( fig .",
    "@xmath36 ) .",
    "the co kinematic major axis varies from @xmath790@xmath11 in the center , to @xmath7125@xmath11 at 5@xmath46 , significantly different from the optical major axis ( pa=150@xmath11 ) and the long axis of the bar ( pa@xmath48 ) . in the lobes the isovelocity contours are nearly parallel to the bar .",
    "while the moment 1 map shows a representation of the the overall co velocity field in ngc 4064 , it does not accurately show the kinematics in the region of double - lined profiles and large velocity gradient , since we have not spatially resolved the apparent shock . in positions with double - peaked line profiles , the moment 1 map shows an intensity - weighted average velocity of the 2 peaks .",
    "thus the true co velocity field would show a much larger velocity gradient in the region of the apparent shock than is shown in the moment 1 map .",
    "a truer view of the kinematics in the region of the apparent shock is provided in figure @xmath49 , which shows position - velocity diagrams parallel and perpendicular to the stellar bar , which is offset by only 20 degrees from the line of nodes ( major axis ) .",
    "the pvds perpendicular to the bar show large velocity gradients across the co lobes , with @xmath50150 @xmath5 over 2@xmath46 ( 150 pc ) in the southern lobe , and an even larger apparent gradient in the northern lobe .",
    "similar co kinematics are observed in other galaxies , including the barred galaxy ngc 7479 ( laine 1999 ) , and the virgo cluster galaxy ngc 4569 ( jogee etal 2004 ) . in the strongly barred galaxy ngc 7479 ( laine 1999 ) , co is strongly concentrated to a narrow ridge along the bar , with large velocity gradients across the ridge , presumably due to a shock front .",
    "ngc 4064 also has large velocity gradients perpendicular to the bar .",
    "the broad line profiles in the southern lobe , and the double peak profiles in the northern lobe , could be the result of the large velocity gradient , marginally resolved with our 4  resolution , caused by a shock front .",
    "the higher velocity components ( with respect to the galaxy center ) correspond to the preshocked gas , and the lower velocity components to the postshocked gas .",
    "the difference in shape of the line profiles between the lobes could be due to a non - uniform distribution of gas within the velocity field .",
    "the pvds provide further insight into the asymmetry in line profile shapes in the southern and northern lobes . in the pv diagram along the bar through the nucleus ( fig @xmath49 ) ,",
    "the low level contours show similar curved features on both sides of the nucleus , but the high level contours have different distributions . whereas in the north",
    "most of the co emission is concentrated at the high and low velocity ends , with little emission at intermediate velocities .",
    "in the south most of the co emission peaks at intermediate velocities . this is consistent with a nearly bi - symmetric velocity field , but a non - uniform distribution of gas within the velocity field .    figures @xmath36 and @xmath51 , show that there is a large co velocity gradient along the minor axis , totalling @xmath7130 @xmath5 across the central 3@xmath46 .",
    "given that the southwestern side of the galaxy is the near side ( based on the stellar kinematics (  4.4.1 ) , and assuming trailing spiral arms ) , these correspond to inward radial streaming motions of 70 @xmath5 in the plane of the galaxy .",
    "the co velocity field in ngc 4424 has similarities with ngc  4064 , although covers less of the central area and is somewhat noiser due to the weaker co emission .",
    "the co isovelocity contours in figure @xmath36 are nearly parallel to the optical major axis and the major axis of the co structure , and nearly perpendicular to the stellar isovelocity contours ( section 4.4 ) . both the moment",
    "1 map and the pvds show a modest co velocity gradient along the major axis , with a velocity difference between the 2 co peaks of only 10 km / s .",

    "the stellar @xmath65 ratio ( fig .",

    "even minor mergers can produce tails and disturbances in the outer disk ( e.g , laine & heller , 1999 ) , unless the collision occurs with a large inclination angle .",
    "such high inclination encounters are less likely to disturb the outer disk , and also increase the resettling time of gas onto the stellar disk , which could explain the persistence of disturbed dust .",
    "an alternate possibility to be considered is that of a non - merging tidal interaction .",

    "a possible problem with this scenario is the lack of tidal tails or outer disk disturbance .",
    "tidal tails are dispersed more quickly in high - velocity encounters , and in clusters ( mihos 2004 ) , although the latter effect may not be so important in the cluster outskirts .",
    "a second possible problem is the disturbed dust lanes .",
    "while tidal interactions can disturb dust lanes somewhat , it is not clear that they can produce the extent of disturbance seen in ngc  4064 .",
    "minor mergers and non - merging tidal encounters can produce broadly similar effects , although a high - inclination minor merger may be more able to produce the observed central disturbances without strongly disturbing the outer stellar disk .",

    "our best scenario for ngc 4064 is a galaxy with a `` truncated / normal '' gas distribution due to a past ram pressure stripping event now undergoing a minor merger ( 1:10 - 1:20 ) with a large inclination angle .",
    "a tidal interaction or collision with a companion ( such as ngc 4049 ) can not however be ruled out .",
    "our results suggest that  truncated / compact  galaxies are the result of the action of at least two environmental processes , namely ram pressure stripping and gravitational interactions .",
    "ram pressure is most important in the core of the cluster where the icm density is large enough to be efficient in removing the ism from the galaxies .",
    "the perturbed morphologies on the other hand are the result of recent gravitational interactions which drive gas to the central kiloparsec thus triggering star formation .",
    "this suggests that the morphological transformation of some galaxies in clusters could be driven by more than a single process .",
    "the future of these galaxies seems clear . without any reservoir of gas",
    "left and assuming the present sfr , the galaxies will consume most their gas during the next 3 gyrs . as the gas continues to infall and undergo star formation , it will form compact circumnuclear stellar disks ( pseudo - bulges)(kormendy & kennicutt 2004 ) , or perhaps even bulges .",
    "outer stellar structures will fade in the next gyr .",
    "since both galaxies have exponential outer galaxy light profiles , they would likely end up as s0 galaxies with small but enhanced bulges or pseudo - bulges .",
    "we have presented optical imaging , 2-d optical spectroscopy and co interferometry of the peculiar virgo cluster galaxies ngc 4064 and ngc 4424 .",
    "our main conclusions are :    \\1 .",
    "optical imaging reveals that ngc 4424 has a heavily disturbed stellar disk , with banana - shaped isophotes and shells .",
    "ngc 4064 has a relatively undisturbed outer stellar disk , with a central stellar bar that smoothly connects with open spiral arms in the outer disk .",
    "both galaxies show strong h@xmath1 emission confined to the central kiloparsec , and little or no h@xmath1 emission beyond . h@xmath1 emission originates from bar - like strings of luminous star formation complexes , surrounded by fainter filaments .",
    "the h@xmath1 radial distributions , which resemble the starlight radial distributions of bulges , have been described as `` truncated / compact '' ( koopmann & kenney 2004 ) , and are distinct from the``truncated / normal '' h@xmath1 morphology associated with simple icm - ism stripping that is found in many virgo spirals .",
    "complexes of young blue stars without associated star formation exist beyond the present location of ongoing star formation , indicating a rapidly shrinking star - forming disks .",
    "the optical b - r images show disturbed dust distributions present in both galaxies .",
    "clear dust extinction features extend to radii of 2 - 3 kpc , much further than the molecular or ionized gas detected by us , although similar to the blue stellar complexes .",
    "the inner dust morphology appears to be affected by the active star formation in the central kiloparsec .",
    "co interferometry reveals in each galaxy two main molecular gas concentrations , located symmetrically about the nucleus at radii of 500 pc .",
    "the co lobes have broad , and in some cases , double - peaked line profiles , and large velocity gradients , suggesting the presence of shocks along a bar . in both galaxies ,",
    "co velocity fields show strong non - circular streaming motions , suggesting that the gas is infalling .",
    "h@xmath1 emission is radially offset inside the co lobes , suggesting a time sequence in which gas is concentrated in a bar , and closer to the center ( downstream ) the gas becomes dense enough to undergo star formation .",
    "star formation consumes much of the molecular gas in the center , leaving a bi - lobal rather than bar - like gas distribution .",
    "the co distributions are asymmetric about both the major and minor axes , similar to the gas distributions in some minor merger simulations .",
    "\\6 . in ngc 4064",
    "the stellar velocity field shows clear kinematic evidence for a strong stellar bar , with a clear pattern of rotation plus bar - like streaming motions . there is a velocity gradient along the minor axis of 20 @xmath5 over 500 pc in the stars , which contrasts with a much larger value of 70 @xmath5 in the molecular gas .",
    "the stars in the galaxy are supported predominantly by random motions in the inner 15 `` , where @xmath83 1 , and supported predominantly by rotation by r=20 '' , where @xmath65=1.4 .",
    "\\7 . in ngc 4424",
    ", the stellar velocity field shows a pattern of largely circular motions , with low line - of - sight velocities .",
    "there is no clear photometric or kinematic evidence of a stellar bar .",
    "the stars in the galaxy are supported predominantly by random motions , with @xmath65=0.7 @xmath26 0.1 at r=18 \" ( 1.4 kpc ) , which is the outermost point we have measured .",
    "the ionized gas in the 5@xmath46 core has disturbed kinematics , and is possibly counterrotating .    \\8 . with its heavily disturbed stellar morphology , small @xmath65 , disturbed dust lanes , central gas bar , and odd core gas kinematics ,",
    "ngc 4424 is very likely an intermediate - mass merger .",
    "the lack of outer disk gas is likely caused by ram pressure stripping , which would be particularly effective on gas driven outwards by the merger , and which might plausibly occur at ngc 4424 s present location in the cluster , at 0.5 virial radii .",
    "the origins of ngc 4064 s disturbances are less clear .",
    "its disturbed dust distribution , asymmetric co distribution , strong central bar with central enhancement in star formation are all suggestive of a recent gravitational encounter , but one which leaves the outer stellar disk relatively undisturbed .",
    "a likely scenario for the gravitational encounter is a recent minor merger with a large inclination angle or a close tidal interaction with the nearby spiral ngc 4049 .",
    "the outer disk gas deficiency is likely due to ram pressure stripping , although its outer cluster location at 1.5 virial radii means that it was either stripped about 2 gyr ago in a core crossing , or stripped more locally and recently by ram pressure much stronger than the smooth static icm case .",
    "our guess about the future of these galaxies is that without any reservoir of gas left and assuming the present sfr , the galaxies will consume most their remaining gas during the next 3 gyrs . as the gas continues to infall and",
    "undergo star formation , it will build compact circumnuclear disks ( pseudo - bulges ) , and perhaps ultimately ( through secular evolution ) bulges .",
    "outer stellar structures will fade in the next gyr .",
    "thus both galaxies will end up as s0 galaxies , with smooth stellar disks , little gas and dust in the the inner 2 kpc , and larger ( although still small ) bulges or pseudo - bulges .",
    "\\11 . while ram pressure stripping likely plays an important role in the formation of lenticular galaxies in clusters , our results support the idea that it is not the only mechanism . gravitational encounters together with ram pressure stripping play a key role in forming the most peculiar objects such as ngc 4424 and ngc 4064 . as demonstrated by ngc 4064",
    ", some of these processes can occur in the outskirts of clusters .",
    "we thank to abhijit saha for kindly providing idl routines for reducing the optical imaging data , rebecca a. koopmann for providing some of the optical imaging data on ngc 4424 , and pieter van dokkum and an anonymous referee for helpful comments which improved the paper .",
