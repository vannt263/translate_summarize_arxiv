    "compared with the electron anomaly , for which all contributions other than qed are negligible , the muon anomaly is more sensitive to shorter scales where the hadronic and weak interaction effects are important . also , provided that the standard model prediction is known precisely , the muon anomaly will be a sensitive probe of physics beyond the standard model .",

    "the uncertainty in ( [ eq : prediction ] ) is dominated by the error associated with the estimate of the strong interaction correction to @xmath10 .",

    "[ sec : summary ] summarizes the present study and compares it with the recent result of ref.@xcite based on the extended nambu - jona - lasinio ( enjl ) model and discuss its implications .",
    "this section begins with an overview of the previous studies on the hadronic light - by - light scattering contribution to the muon anomaly .",
    "we then point out a few problems associated with its evaluation , and describe the procedure which we have adopted to solve them .",
    "the muon anomalous magnetic moment receives important contributions from hadronic physics .",
    "naive dimensional consideration suggests that the effect of the physics of the typical scale @xmath22 higher than the muon mass @xmath23 is suppressed by @xmath24 .",
    "this implies that contributions to @xmath10 from qcd will be dominated by nonperturbative aspects of qcd .",
    "thus we are confronted with a calculational difficulty ; the relevant hadronic contribution to the light - by - light scattering amplitude may not be calculable from first principles in the current stage of development of qcd .",
    "as the next best procedure , we may appeal to the chiral perturbation theory which attempts to describe the low energy dynamics of qcd in terms of hadrons .",
    "its leading behavior is given unambiguously by the low energy theorems on the dynamics of pions ( and kaons ) which are the nambu - goldstone bosons resulting from spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry .",
    "the scalar qed calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite corresponds to the lowest - order evaluation in this context .",
    "corrections to the lowest order results may be obtained by adding higher order terms of a power series expansion in momentum variables .    for the calculation of the muon @xmath21",
    ", however , such a systematic chiral perturbation technique runs into some problems .",
    "insertion of a vertex with high power of momentum into feynman diagrams for the muon anomaly , as a correction to the hadronic light - by - light scattering amplitude , yields a divergent result .",
    "thus we must resort to an alternative approach which unfortunately is more model - dependent .",
    "for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite introduced the vector meson resonances .",
    "it should be noted that the explicit incorporation of vector mesons allows one to compute higher order counterterms @xcite in the chiral lagrangian .",
    "the resulting @xmath25 counter terms agree reasonably well with experimental determination .",
    "a well - known example of the success in this direction can be seen in the description of pion s electromagnetic form factor @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the photon momentum . there",
    ", the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) model works even for @xmath27 as large as the mass of @xmath28 meson , @xmath29 .",
    "now we shall return to our topic . from the point of view of chiral perturbation theory",
    ", pions will contribute to @xmath10 most significantly in the form of the diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams](a ) and ( b ) . a priori we do not know the magnitudes of photon momenta which are important for these contributions . for example one may attempt to estimate the contribution of fig . [",
    "fig : diagrams](a ) in the lowest - order of chiral expansion which we will denote as @xmath30 . on the other hand",
    "we recognize that the vmd model describes the @xmath31 coupling well for on - shell pions .",
    "thus we are motivated to include the vmd model explicitly in the @xmath32 coupling . a naive approach , which leads to @xmath33 , introduces vector meson to replace a photon propagator as @xcite ; @xmath34 the numerical results obtained by following these procedures were @xcite @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively .",
    "we see a large modification when vector mesons are introduced .",
    "a natural question arising from this observation is :    ( @xmath37 ) is the modification caused by the introduction of vmd model real ? if it is , why it seems to conflict with our expectation based on chiral perturbation theory that the vector meson effect is very small at low energies ?",
    "next let us turn our attention to the diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams](b ) .",
    "it includes the @xmath38 vertex induced by the chiral anomaly .",
    "it is well - known that the effective interaction @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the pion decay constant and @xmath41 is the field strength of photon , describes the behavior of @xmath38 vertex in the limit of zero pion momentum and on - shell photons .",
    "however , naive use of eq .",
    "( [ point - anomaly ] ) for the @xmath38 vertices in the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams](b ) leads to an ultra - violet divergent result .",
    "this is a signal that the interaction ( [ point - anomaly ] ) is not applicable to photons and pions far off mass - shell and must be replaced there by some form factor . in ref .",
    "@xcite such a form factor was introduced by an @xmath42 adoption of the vmd picture . correcting a sign error in the previous calculation @xcite",
    ", this contribution was found to be @xmath43 in the previous analysis the quark loop diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams](c ) has been treated as _ not _ independent of the first two diagrams .",
    "rather it was used as an alternative approximation of the hadronic light - by - light scattering contribution to @xmath10 . if this assertion is correct , the result for quark loop @xcite @xmath44 in which constituent quark masses are used , should be nearly equal to the sum of ( [ kno - loop ] ) and ( [ kno - pion - pole ] ) . however , even their signs do not agree with each other",
    ".    therefore there arises the second question :    ( @xmath45 ) are three diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] independent after all ?",
    "we will examine these questions and explore the prescriptions for remedy in the next subsection .",
    "first consider the question @xmath37 .",
    "it has been pointed out that the naive vmd model of @xcite does not respect the ward identities required from electromagnetic gauge symmetry @xcite .",
    "we found further that it is not compatible with chiral symmetry . to solve these problems ,",
    "it is useful to introduce vmd in a way that preserves chiral symmetry .",
    "this can be achieved by appealing to the hidden local symmetry ( hls ) approach @xcite .",
    "this formulation maintains gauge invariance and chiral symmetry explicitly and reproduces all the low energy theorems assured by chiral symmetry , such as the ksfr relation .",
    "the question @xmath37 may thus be raised within the hls framework .",
    "keep in mind , however , that this approach is somewhat oversimplified .",
    "in particular it ignores higher resonances beyond the usual vector mesons .",
    "we must analyze and reevaluate the error in our final result taking account of the model - dependence .",
    "we shall now turn to the second question @xmath45 .",
    "the previous work assumed that the quark loop calculation and the pion calculation are two distinct approximations to the same hadronic light - by - light scattering effect on @xmath10 .",
    "they should , therefore , yield the similar results and must not be added together . as was noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , in the extended nambu - jona - lasinio ( enjl ) model , the quark loop diagram contribution is independent of the other two so that all three contributions should be added altogether .",
    "this point can be made clearer by considering the @xmath46 expansion together with the chiral expansion .",
    "table [ tab : orders ] lists the orders of each diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] . according to the qcd - diagrammatic consideration",
    ", the pion loop needs at least two quark loops , and the pion pole diagram starts from a diagram in which at least one gluon propagates between a quark and an antiquark forming the pion .",
    "thus a single quark loop contribution is not included in these two graphs .",
    "we may also examine this problem from the viewpoint of duality . in a dispersion relation for the light - by - light scattering amplitude ,",
    "the integral over the quark loop diagram , from threshold to very high energies , is equal to the integral over the absorptive part due to all the hadronic intermediate states .",
    "extension of this relation to local duality implies that the quark loop contribution approximates the hadronic contribution when certain averaging over a finite energy region is taken .",
    "thus one may wonder if the quark loop diagram fig .",
    "2(c ) , when embedded in the @xmath21 graph , represents the entire hadronic contribution .",
    "we do not think so for the following reason . consider a similar problem in the photon vacuum polarization diagram , and look at the cross section for low energy reaction @xmath47 .",
    "duality between the quark diagram and the resonances implies that @xmath48 where the integration range is sufficiently large so that the resonance is averaged out . in this sense",
    ", it is well known that the absorptive part of one quark loop diagram for the photon vacuum polarization is dual to the cross section from the @xmath49 threshold to about 1 gev .",
    "this region is dominated by the @xmath50 meson intermediate state , and the quark loop represents this contribution . then there is a small continuum @xmath49 state contribution at lower energies . near threshold , they can be calculated by chiral symmetry argument .",
    "is this a part of the quark loop diagram or is it a non - resonating continuum ? if it is a part of @xmath50 , we suspect that a chiral invariant @xmath49 interaction should be able to generate the @xmath50 meson bound state .",
    "as is well known @xcite , however , the force between two @xmath51 mesons is not attractive enough to generate a bound @xmath50 state .",
    "this supports the view that the @xmath49 intermediate state at low energies is independent of @xmath50 resonance and hence independent of one - quark - loop contribution .",
    "for the photon vacuum polarization graph , pion loop graph and quark loop graph are independent and must be added together .",
    "the above argument suggests that the pion loop is independent of the quark loop in light - by - light scattering , too .",
    "the quark loop diagram corresponds to the sum of continuum hadronic channels as well as axial vector meson states .",
    "of course , this is by no means a proof .",
    "since it is impossible to prove this type of statements without solving qcd , we must keep this ambiguity in mind in our subsequent analysis .",
    "let us summarize the above considerations and add a few corollaries :    \\(1 ) the hls approach avoids the inconsistency that has been observed in the naive vmd approach used in the previous analysis , i.e. , violation of chiral symmetry and electromagnetic ward identities ( this will be demonstrated in sec .
