    "one of the less trivial questions in the study of phase - transitions is the determination of the order of transition .",
    "a large amount of work , especially on the potts @xcite model , ranging from the exact solutions @xcite to different kinds of monte carlo ( mc ) simulations @xcite ( to cite only some of them ) , has been done in order to establish reliable and at the same time applicable criteria for distinction between the first- and second - order phase transition .",
    "the coexistence of two different phases at the first - order phase transition point and its absence at the second - order phase transition point is the main physical fact on which all of the above methods ( including the present one ) are based . performing the mc simulations on finite models in order to obtain",
    "the probability distribution of some quantity ( such as the energy or the order parameter ) which has different values in different phases , is the usual way to investigate these phase transitions numerically@xcite . in the present paper",
    "we show that the quantity which we define as the graph weight also has different values in the coexisting phases at the first - order transition point . in section [ sec - res ] it",
    "is shown how the graph weight is related to the energy and the free energy of the system .",
    "the coexistence of phases with different energy at the first - order transition point then implies the coexistence of graphs with different weights .",
    "it can be identified by the two peaks in the graph - weight probability distribution .    in order to test the graph approach , we analyse the potts model in two cases : the mean - field ( mf ) case defined by the interactions of equal strength between all particles of the model and the one - dimensional @xmath1 model with long - range ( lr ) interactions decaying with distance @xmath2 as @xmath3 , @xmath4 . in both cases",
    "two regimes ( of the first- and second - order transition ) are present .",
    "the regimes are separated by a point @xmath5 in the mf case and by a line @xmath6 in the lr case .",
    "the present approach has also the advantage of dealing directly with the non - integer values of the potts states @xmath0 .",
    "( note that in reference @xcite the non - integer @xmath0 values were not obtained by a direct calculation , but by a histogram - like extrapolation from the results for integer-@xmath0 . )",
    "this may be of interest in studying the threshold @xmath5 , separating the first- from the second - order transition regime , which is not always an integer .",
    "for example , in three - dimensional short - range ( sr ) potts model , @xmath5 is not an integer @xcite , and in @xmath1 potts model with lr interaction , the onset of the first order transition at @xmath5 seems to depend continuously on the interaction - range parameter @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we define the model and introduce the corresponding graph expansion .",
    "the basic steps of mc algorithm are also explained in that section . in the third section",
    "we discuss separately the results for the mf and the lr interaction case . in the last section",
    "we summarize and discuss the advantages and open problems connected with the graph approach .",
    "the graph representation @xcite was already used in mc investigation of critical behaviour of potts models @xcite . in the present approach",
    "we follow the line of reasoning given in reference @xcite , but with the basic difference that we study directly the probability distribution of graph weights and not the cluster probability distribution .",
    "we begin by rewriting the model in the graph language .",
    "the reduced hamiltonian of the model , with periodic boundary conditions , has the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the potts particle placed on the @xmath10-th site of the chain , while @xmath11 denotes the kronecker symbol .",
    "@xmath12 s denote interactions between two particles at distance @xmath13 .",
    "due to boundary conditions in the lr case , each @xmath12 has two contributions involving interactions at distances @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in the mf case ,",
    "the interactions are unique and the boundary conditions have no meaning .",
    "we use the system of units where @xmath12 is proportional to the inverse temperature .    the usual substitution , @xmath15 = 1 + v_j \\",
    ", \\delta(s_i , s_{i+j})$ ] , with @xmath16 , leads to the partition function of the form @xmath17.\\ ] ] it is straightforward to establish one - to - one correspondence between each member of the r.h.s . of the above equation and a graph on the chain consisting of @xmath18 particles .",
    "each square bracket can contribute to the above product in two ways : it gives @xmath19 when there is no connection between the @xmath10-th and the @xmath20-th particle ( inactive link ) , and @xmath21 when there is a direct connection ( active link ) between these two particles . the analytical expression attached to each graph @xmath22",
    "will be called the graph weight , @xmath23 . the explicit expression for @xmath23 follows from the r.h.s .",
    "( [ eq : pf ] ) .",
    "we can describe every graph consisting of @xmath24 clusters . by _ cluster _",
    "we mean a set of particles interconnected by any type of active links and disconnected from other particles .",
    "single particles are considered as one - particle clusters .",
    "the products of @xmath11-functions from the expression for each graph will delete all except @xmath25 @xmath0-summations on the r.h.s . of ( [ eq : pf ] ) , so that the analytical expression for @xmath23 is @xmath26 the symbols @xmath27 denote the total number of active links of type @xmath13 .    in this way",
    ", the summation over all @xmath28 possible graphs between @xmath18 particles corresponds to the partition function of the model @xmath29 the @xmath30 denotes the number of different graphs with the same weight @xmath31 .",
    "the above equation is thus the graph analogy of the more familiar expression @xmath32 where the summation runs over all different energies @xmath33 of the system , while @xmath34 is their degeneracy .",
    "indeed , behind the analogy , there is a connection between the average number of clusters and the active links and average of energy and free energy of the system .",
    "the derivative of the partition function , given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : w ] ) , ( [ eq : pfallw ] ) and ( [ eq : pfe ] ) , over temperature @xcite leads to @xmath35 while the derivative over @xmath0 leads to @xmath36 the coexistence of two phases characterized by different values of energy corresponds , by the above relations , to the coexistence of graphs with different weights .    according to ( [ eq : pfallw ] ) ,",
    "one introduces the graph - weight probability distribution @xmath37 @xmath38 numerically , @xmath37 is obtained by a simple mc simulation of metropolis type .",
    "the basic steps are :    \\(a ) pick at random one link in the graph @xmath22 and change its status from active to inactive or _",
    "vice versa_. the resulting graph is called @xmath39 .",
    "+ ( b ) compare the random number @xmath40 with the ratio @xmath41 .",
    "if the ratio is smaller than @xmath2 keep @xmath22 , otherwise save @xmath39 as @xmath22 .",
    "+ ( c ) return to ( a ) .    at each step",
    ", the number of clusters has to be counted .",
    "since we deal with a model with interactions of infinite range , the determination of clusters could not be performed by determination of their boundaries , but one has to check for possible connections with all the particles of the considered cluster .",
    "to do so , during the simulations , we have to keep record of the cluster structure of the system , i.e. which particle belongs to which cluster . we start with a simple and known cluster configuration . in each of the following mc steps , when one link is changed , we examine whether this has produced a change in cluster structure : if the link is deactivated - whether the corresponding cluster is split in two or not ; if the link is activated - whether two clusters get connected or not .    counting graphs by their weights through a large number of steps",
    "gives the unnormalized graph - weight probability distribution .",
    "unfortunately , the shortcoming of the graph approach , is that it takes a much longer time to obtain the same precision of results compared to the simulation techniques that can be applied only for integer @xmath0 ( like algorithm by luijten and blte @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the comparison of the present approach with the simple metropolis single spin flip algorithm done for the model of n particles with integer @xmath0 shows that @xmath42 flips per link of everyone of @xmath43 links in graph simulations give approximately the same precision as @xmath44 one - particle flips per particle in the spin simulations .",
    "for the chain of 400 sites considered here , the graph approach requires about @xmath45 times larger cpu time than the metropolis algorithm on spins .",
    "the simulations were applied to the two mentioned cases of the potts model with @xmath46 and @xmath47 particles . in final extrapolations",
    "only the data for @xmath48 were used .",
    "the precision of simulations is determined by performing @xmath42 flips per link .",
    "the mf case of hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) is given by taking the equal strength of interactions among all the particles , i.e. @xmath49 , where @xmath50 denotes the inverse temperature .",
    "the exact work of kihara _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite puts in evidence that the mf potts model has a second - order phase transition for @xmath51 and a first - order phase transition for @xmath52 .",
    "it thus qualifies as a good example for testing the present approach . in our simulation",
    "we start with the case @xmath53 . in continuation , we consider lower values of @xmath0 , closer to the threshold @xmath5 in order to examine how efficient our approach can be in detecting weak first - order transitions .",
    "the shape of the finite-@xmath18 graph - weight probability distribution @xmath37 depends on temperature in a similar way as the energy - probability distribution does .",
    "far from the transition temperature , @xmath37 has a gaussian form . at the transition ,",
    "the shape of @xmath37 depends on the order of the transition . for second - order transitions ,",
    "the shape has a non - gaussian form , but it still has only one maximum . for first - order transitions , @xmath37 has two maxima which transform into two @xmath11-functions in the thermodynamic limit .",

    "the corresponding positions on the graph - weight axis are @xmath55 ( for the ordered phase ) and @xmath56 ( for the disordered phase ) . when the two - peak structure of @xmath37 becomes more pronounced with increasing @xmath18",
    ", one may conclude that the transition is of the first order in the thermodynamic limit with two coexisting phases : the one described by the graph weight @xmath57 , stable below the transition temperature @xmath58 , and the other one described by @xmath59 stable above @xmath60 .    in figure 1",
    "are presented the results of simulations for @xmath61 .",
    "it shows dependence of @xmath37 on @xmath62 at temperatures @xmath54 .",
    "the peaks emerge for @xmath63 and become more pronounced with increasing @xmath18 . by the above arguments , the @xmath18-dependence of @xmath37 confirms the existence of the first - order phase transition , in agreement with the exact solution @xcite .",
    "the behaviour for smaller @xmath18 considered ( @xmath64 ) points out that only one maximum in @xmath37 may have different origins : either the transition is of the second order in the thermodynamic limit and we observe its finite-@xmath18 behaviour , or the transition is of the first order in the thermodynamic limit , but the correlation length , although finite , is comparable with the system size used and we are not able to see the coexistence of the two phases . arbitrarily close to the threshold which separates the first- from the second - order transitions , the correlation length is expected to become arbitrarily large and finally whatever system size is used , it will always be too small to show the first - order character of the transition .",

    "the purpose of simulations presented in this subsection is twofold : first , we wish to test the above described graph approach comparing the results with those obtained earlier by mc simulation of energy probability distribution ( strong first - order transition for model with @xmath53 and @xmath92 ) ; second , by using the same graph approach we wish to analyze an example of a non - integer @xmath0 model with a second - order phase transition @xcite ( we choose @xmath93 and @xmath94 and @xmath95 ) .",

    "compared to the mf results and also to those for higher values of @xmath7 , the results for @xmath92 converge very slowly , so that , for sizes considered here , we do not expect so good accuracy in extrapolation to @xmath99 .",
