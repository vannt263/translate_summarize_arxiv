    "cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cavity qed ) has been a powerful tool in a lot of investigations dealing with fundamentals of quantum physics and applications such as quantum information processing , for a review see , e.g. , refs .",
    "it has offered a number of proposals for quantum - state generation , manipulation , and transfer between remote nodes in quantum networks .",
    "a cavity is a resonatorlike device with one or more fractionally transparent mirrors characterized by small transmission coefficients such that large quality values @xmath0 can be realized .",
    "hence one may regard the mode spectrum of the intracavity field as consisting of narrow lines . as a rule ,",
    "excited atoms inside the cavity serve as source of radiation , and the fractionally transparent mirrors are used to release radiation for further applications and to feed radiation in the cavity in order to modify the intracavity field and thereby the outgoing field either",
    ".    manipulations with atoms in cavities and cavity fields give a number of possibilities of quantum - state engineering , see , e.g. , refs .  @xcite .",
    "for example , schemes for the generation of arbitrary field states have been proposed @xcite .",
    "further , proposals for the generation of entangled - states of light have been made ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "it is worth noting that , using the technique of adiabatic atom transitions coherent superposition states of the radiation field inside the cavity can be prepared @xcite .",
    "the field escaping from an excited cavity has been proposed to be used for homodyne detection of the intracavity mode and reconstruction of its quantum state @xcite .",
    "since the output mode is a nonmonochromatic one , this proposal is based on an operational definition of the wigner function .",
    "the employment of cavities as remote nodes in quantum networks has been proposed @xcite .",
    "laser driving of atoms allows one to create such a specific pulse of the output mode which is completely coupled into another cavity .",
    "this can be used for transferring quantum states between spatially separated atoms trapped inside cavities .",
    "cavities are also important in optical parametric amplification frequently used for the generation of squeezed states @xcite .",
    "one of the most crucial points in implementing the proposed schemes such as the ones mentioned above is the decoherence .",
    "it appears due to the uncontrolled interaction of the radiation with some external degrees of freedom giving rise to absorption and scattering of the radiation one is interested in . in this context , a serious drawback is the fact that for high-@xmath0 optical cavities , at least with the presently available technology , such unwanted losses can be of the same order of magnitude as the wanted losses associated with the transmittance of the coupling mirrors @xcite .",
    "thus , nonclassical features of the outgoing field can be substantially reduced compared with the corresponding properties of the intracavity field @xcite .    there",
    "exist several approaches to the theoretical description of leaky cavities for the idealized case that unwanted losses can be ignored . within the framework of quantum noise theory ( qnt ) , in ref .",
    "@xcite each intracavity mode is linearly coupled , through one or more fractionally transparent mirrors , with a continuum of external modes forming dissipative systems for the intracavity modes . based on markovian approximation , it can be concluded that the intracavity modes obey quantum langevin equations . the external field",
    "is composed of two kinds of fields : input and output ones , where the input field gives rise to the langevin noise forces .",
    "moreover , the input and output fields are related to each other by means of input - output relation",
    ".    the quantum field theoretical ( qft ) approaches to the problem are based on ( macroscopic ) qed . so refs .",
    "@xcite start directly from an ordinary continuous - mode expansion of the electromagnetic field in the presence of passive , nonabsorbing media @xcite . under certain conditions",
    ", this approach also leads to a description of the cavity in terms of quantum langevin equations and input - output relation . in another version of the qft approach @xcite ,",
    "solutions of maxwell s equations are constructed by using feshbach s projection formalism @xcite . separating from the beginning all degrees of freedom into two parts  internal and external ones ",
    "one can also obtain , in some approximation , the hamiltonian used in qnt .",
    "as already mentioned , the standard versions of both the qnt approach and the qft approach do not take into account the presence of unwanted losses and hence , the additional , unwanted noise unavoidably associated with them .",
    "thus , these theories can not be applied to realistic situations , in general . within an extended version of the qnt approach ,",
    "the unwanted losses the intracavity field suffers from can be modeled by introduction into the langevin equations additional damping and noise terms , which corresponds to the introduction into the system of additional input - output ports @xcite .",
    "the applicability of this model is restricted , in general , to the case of all the input ports being unused .",
    "more recently a qft approach to the description of a leaky cavity with unwanted noise has been presented @xcite .",
    "applying quantization of the electromagnetic field in dispersing and absorbing media @xcite , a generalized langevin equation and input - output relation have been derived .",
    "an extended version of the qnt approach can be obtained by applying the model of imperfect coupling between two systems , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite . in this scheme ,",
    "a unidirectional coupling of the considered systems is studied , the unwanted noise being modeled by beam splitters inserted in the input and output channels . for transferring such a method to the description of a cavity with unwanted noise",
    ", one must carefully check the completeness of the parametrization of the considered replacement schemes .    in the present paper",
    "we generalize , by means of replacement schemes , the qnt approach with the aim to complete both the quantum langevin equations and the input - output relation in a consistent way , such that unwanted noise is fully included in the theory  in full agreement with the qft approach in ref .",
    "the analysis will show that there exist different formulations of the theory .",
    "favoring one over the other may depend on the physical conditions and on the available information on the cavity .",
    "moreover , we will demonstrate that an incomplete description of the unwanted noise may ignore important physical effects .",
    "as an example it is shown that the unwanted noise may lead to the combination of a cavity input mode with the intracavity mode in a nonmonochromatic output mode .",
    "such mode matching does not occur in an ideal leaky cavity or in some incomplete models of unwanted noise effects .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] a beam - splitter - based replacement scheme is introduced which is suitable for modeling the unwanted noise of a one - sided cavity .",
    "both the quantum langevin equation and the input - output relation associated with the replacement scheme are presented .",
    "the relations between the @xmath1-number coefficients in these equations are derived .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] is devoted to the problem of consistency and completeness of a given quantum langevin equation together with the corresponding input - output relations .",
    "it is shown that the requirement of preserving commutation rules necessarily leads to constraints on the @xmath1-number coefficients in the theory .",
    "the effect of noise - induced mode coupling between intracavity and input modes is considered in sec .",
    "section  [ appl ] is devoted to the application of this effect to the problem of unbalanced and cascaded homodyning of the intracavity mode .",
    "finally , a summary and some concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the unwanted loss of cavity photons due to scattering and absorption can be modeled by appropriately chosen input and output ports .",
    "this is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] in the simplest case for a one - sided cavity , where the operators @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , correspond to the wanted radiative input and output , whereas the operators @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , correspond to input and output channels associated with unwanted noise .",
    "the scheme is formally equivalent to a four - port cavity having two fractionally transparent mirrors as considered in ref .",
    "hence any ( single - mode ) cavity operator @xmath6 can be assumed to obey a quantum langevin equation of the type @xmath7\\hat{a}_\\mathrm{cav}(t ) \\nonumber\\\\ & \\hspace{3ex } + \\sqrt{\\gamma}\\,\\hat{d}_\\mathrm{in}\\left(t\\right ) + { \\mathcal{a}}\\hat{c}_\\mathrm{in}\\left(t\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the corresponding input - output relation reads as @xmath8 here , @xmath9 is the resonance frequency of the cavity , @xmath10 is the decay rate caused by the wanted output channel , and @xmath11 is the part of the decay rate due to unwanted internal noise , where , for some reason which will be clarified later , @xmath12 is assumed to be a complex number .",
    "note that such an approach has effectively been used in ref .",
    "@xcite for analyzing the quantum - state extraction from a cavity in the presence of unwanted losses .",
    "it is useful when the input field is in the vacuum state . in this case",
    "the possibility of absorption or scattering of input photons plays no role .      in the most general case",
    "one may use the input port of a cavity for different purposes , e.g. , for combining the intracavity and input modes in an output mode .",
    "this possibility can be useful for the quantum - state reconstruction as considered in sec .",
    "for a correct description of such a process one should take into account that input photons can be absorbed or scattered by the coupling mirror before entering into the cavity .",
    "the corresponding type of unwanted noise can be included in the theory in a systematic way by applying the concept of replacement schemes as follows . instead of considering the actual coupling mirror",
    ", we consider an ideal semitransparent mirror that does not give rise to unwanted noise and we model the unwanted noise by inserting appropriately chosen beam splitters in the input and output channels of the cavity , as sketched in fig .",
    ". clearly , the symmetric beam splitters bs@xmath13 and bs@xmath14 , respectively , are closely related to the unwanted losses that the input and output fields suffer when passing through the coupling mirror .",
    "moreover it will turn out that a third beam splitter bs@xmath15 is required , which simulates some feedback .",
    "this ( asymmetric ) beam splitter is allowed to realize an u(2)-group transformation , thereby introducing an additional phase shift ( see appendix  [ app1 ] and refs .",
    "including such a feedback into the theory ensures one to describe all kinds of unwanted noise in high-@xmath0 cavities . the corresponding proof is given in sec .",
