    "the classical and quantum propagation of strings in curved spacetimes has attracted a great deal of interest in recent years .",
    "the main complication , as compared to the case of flat minkowski space , is related to the non - linearity of the equations of motion .",
    "it makes it possible to obtain the complete analytic solution only in a very few special cases like conical spacetime @xcite and plane wave / shock wave backgrounds @xcite .",
    "there are however also very general results concerning integrability and solvability for maximally symmetric spacetimes @xcite and gauged wzw models @xcite .",
    "these are the exceptional cases , generally the string equations of motion in curved spacetimes are not integrable and even if they are , it is usually an extremely difficult task to actually separate the equations , integrate them and finally write down the complete solution in closed form .",
    "fortunately there are different ways to `` attack '' a system of coupled non - linear partial differential equations .",
    "besides numerical methods , which will not be considered here , there are essentially two ways to proceed : an approximative method was first developed by de vega and snchez @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the idea was to expand the target space coordinates around a special solution , usually taken to be the string center of mass , and then to ( try to ) solve the string equations of motion and constraints order by order .",
    "this can be done , at least up to first or second order in the expansion , for most of the known gravitational and cosmological spacetimes . for a review of the method and its applications ,",
    "see for instance @xcite .",
    "another approximative method , which is however not un - related to the first one , was considered in refs.@xcite .",
    "it consists of a large scale - factor expansion in spatially flat frw - universes and an important result of the analysis was the discovery of `` extremely unstable strings '' of negative pressure in inflationary universes .",
    "as already mentioned there are a few examples where the equations of motion and constraints can actually be solved completely .",
    "if this is not possible one can try to find special , but exact , solutions by making an ansatz .",
    "if the ansatz is properly chosen , i.e. such that it exploits the symmetries of the spacetime , it may reduce the original system of coupled non - linear partial differential equations to something much simpler , for instance decoupled non - linear ordinary differential equations , and it may then be possible to find the complete solution of this reduced system .",
    "this method has been used for stationary open strings @xcite and for circular strings in a variety of curved spacetimes @xcite . when using this method , one somehow has to argue that the special solutions under consideration are representative in the sense that their physical properties are more general than the solutions themselves .",
    "this is done by comparing with the results obtained from the approximative methods , so it is very important to have , and to use , both kinds of methods . in this talk",
    "i will present material bases on both exact and approximative methods and i will try to take a physical point of view and address the question : what are the strings actually doing in the curved spacetimes ?    the talk is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we consider circular strings in stationary axially symmetric backgrounds .",
    "the main result is the effective potential determining the circular string radius .",
    "the main part of the talk concerns circular strings in de sitter space , as indicated by the title .",
    "the material is based on refs.@xcite and is presented in section 3 .",
    "we first consider the energy and pressure of the different types of strings .",
    "we then turn to the mathematical solutions and their physical interpretation , following closely ref.@xcite .",
    "finally we consider briefly the propagation of small perturbations around the circular strings . in section 4",
    "we consider circular strings in the background of the @xmath0 dimensional black hole anti de sitter spacetime , recently found by baados et .",
    "@xcite and in section 5 we compare with circular strings in ordinary black hole and anti de sitter spacetimes . in section 6",
    "we first refine the approximative string perturbation approach of de vega and snchez @xcite by eliminating , from the beginning , the perturbations in the direction of the geodesic of the string center of mass .",
    "we then discuss some of the results obtained in ref.@xcite , using this method , and we compare with the results obtained for circular strings .",
    "the main conclusions of the talk are compactly summarized in tables i , ii , iii .",
    "in this section we consider circular strings embedded in stationary axially symmetric backgrounds .",
    "the analysis is carried out in @xmath0 dimensions , but the results will hold for the equatorial plane of higher dimensional backgrounds as well . to be more specific",
    "we consider the following line element : @xmath2 that will be general enough for our purposes here .",
    "the circular string ansatz , consistent with the symmetries of the background , is taken to be : @xmath3 where the three functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 are to be determined by the equations of motion and constraints .",
    "the equations of motion lead to : @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 while the constraints become : @xmath9 @xmath10 this system of second order ordinary differential equations and constraints is most easily described as a hamiltonian system : @xmath11 supplemented by the constraints : @xmath12 the function @xmath5 introduced in eq .",

    "the first thing to do for a stationary axially symmetric background under consideration , is therefore to find the zeros of the potential .",

    "strings can expand from @xmath37 towards infinity and very large strings can collapse .",
    "finally if @xmath38 there is a ( unstable ) stationary string at the top of the potential as well as expanding and collapsing strings .",
    "it is instructive to compare with the circular string dynamics in minkowski space . in that case",
    "the potential is given by @xmath39 and only oscillating strings exist .",
    "physically the difference is not so difficult to understand . in flat minkowski space the dynamics of a circular string",
    "is determined by the string tension only , that will always try to contract the string .",
    "this leads to strings oscillating between @xmath37 and some maximal size depending on the energy . in de sitter space",
    "there is an opposite effect namely the expansion of the universe , that will try to expand the string .",
    "this gives rise to a region where the tension is strongest ( to the left of the barrier ) , a region where the expansion of the universe is strongest ( to the right of the barrier ) and there may even be an exact balance of the two opposite forces , implying the existence of a stationary solution .    before coming to the mathematical solution of the equations of motion",
    ", we consider the energy and pressure of the strings .",

    "we get the explicit expressions @xcite : @xmath44 @xmath45 both the energy and the pressure now depend on the string radius @xmath23 and the velocity @xmath46 the latter can however be eliminated using eq .",
    "( 2.11 ) and eq . ( 3.4 ) .",
    "let us first consider a string expanding from @xmath37 towards infinity .",

    "such type of circular string solutions also exist in other stringy black hole backgrounds @xcite . :",
    "for @xmath236 there is only one positive-@xmath23 zero of the potential , which is always located outside the static limit ( fig.6b ) .",
    "the potential is negative for @xmath37 , so there is no barrier preventing the string from collapsing into @xmath37 . by suitably fixing the initial conditions the string starts with its maximal size outside the static limit at @xmath237 .",
    "it then contracts through the ergosphere and the two horizons and eventually falls into @xmath37 .",
    "if @xmath238 it may however still be possible to continue this solution into another universe as in the case * ( i)*. : @xmath239 is the limiting case where the maximal string radius equals the static limit . the potential is exactly zero for @xmath37 so also in this case the string contracts through the two horizons and eventually falls into @xmath37 .",
    "the exact and complete mathematical solution can be obtained in terms of elementary or elliptic functions , the details can be found in ref.@xcite . in all cases",

    "@xmath244 the metric , eq .",
    "( 5.1 ) , is in the general form of eq .",
    "( 2.1 ) so that we can use the analysis of section 2 . in the most general case the potential",
    "is given by : @xmath245 i.e. the potential covers seven powers in @xmath23 .",
    "the general solution will therefore involve higher genus elliptic functions .",
    "it is furthermore very complicated to deduce the physical properties of the circular strings from the shape of the potential ( the zeros etc . ) since the invariant string size defined in eq .",
    "( 2.14 ) is non - trivially connected to @xmath246 @xmath247 we have exactly solved the string dynamics in a number of spacetimes of the form , eq .",
    "( 5.1 ) @xcite . in the cases of minkowski space , anti de sitter space , schwarzschild and schwarzschild anti de sitter space , fig.7 . , there are only bounded string size solutions and no multi - string solutions . in schwarzschild",
    "de sitter space , on the other hand , the dynamics outside the schwarzschild horizon is similar to the dynamics in `` pure '' de sitter space , so we find the complicated spectrum of oscillating , expanding and contracting strings and the multi - string solutions , see table ii .",
    "to obtain more insight about the string propagation in all these curved spacetimes we solved the string equations of motion and constraints by considering perturbations around the exact string center of mass solution , refining the approach originally developed by de vega and snchez @xcite . in an arbitrary curved spacetime of dimension @xmath248 , the string equations of motion and constraints , in the conformal gauge ,",
    "take the form : @xmath249 @xmath250 for @xmath251 and prime and dot represent derivative with respect to @xmath148 and @xmath252 respectively .",
    "consider first the equations of motion , eq .",
    ". a particular solution is provided by the string center of mass @xmath253 : @xmath254 then a perturbative series around this solution is developed : @xmath255 after insertion of eq .",
    "( 6.4 ) in eq . ( 6.1 ) , the equations of motion are to be solved order by order in the expansion .",
    "to zeroth order we just get eq . ( 6.3 ) . to first order",
    "we find : @xmath256 the first three terms can be written in covariant form @xcite , c.f .",
    "the ordinary geodesic deviation equation : @xmath257 however , we can go one step further . for a massive string , corresponding to the string center of mass fulfilling ( in units where @xmath258 ) : @xmath259 there are @xmath260 physical polarizations of string perturbations around the geodesic @xmath253 .",
    "we therefore introduce @xmath260 normal vectors @xmath261 : @xmath262 and consider only first order perturbations in the form : @xmath263 where @xmath220 are the comoving perturbations , i.e. the perturbations as seen by an observer travelling with the center of mass of the string .",
    "the normal vectors are not uniquely defined by eqs .",
    "in fact , there is a gauge invariance originating from the freedom to make local rotations of the @xmath264-bein spanned by the normal vectors . for our purposes",
    "it is convenient to fix the gauge taking the normal vectors to be covariantly constant : @xmath265 this is achieved by choosing the basis @xmath266 obeying the conditions given by eqs .",
    "( 6.8 ) at a given point , and defining it along the geodesic by means of parallel transport .",
    "another useful formula is the completeness relation that takes the form : @xmath267 using eqs .",
    "( 6.7)-(6.10 ) in eq .",
    "( 6.6 ) , we find after multiplication by @xmath268 the spacetime invariant formula @xcite : @xmath269 since the last term depends on @xmath148 only through @xmath270 it is convenient to make a fourier expansion : @xmath271 then eq .",
    "( 6.12 ) finally reduces to : @xmath272 which constitutes a matrix schrdinger equation with @xmath67 playing the role of the spatial coordinate .",
    "notice that in the case of constant curvature spacetimes , @xmath273 the `` potential '' in eq .",
    "( 6.14 ) is obtained directly from the normalization equations ( 6.7 ) and ( 6.8 ) without any calculations at all .",
    "for the second order perturbations the picture is a little more complicated .",
    "since they couple to the first order perturbations we consider the full set of perturbations @xmath274 @xcite : @xmath275 where the source @xmath276 is bilinear in the first order perturbations , and explicitly given by : @xmath277 after solving eqs .",
    "( 6.14)-(6.15 ) for the first and second order perturbations , the constraints , eq .",

    "coordinates @xmath278 the constraints take the form : @xmath279 where @xmath280 .",
    "the world - sheet energy - momentum tensor @xmath281 is conserved , as can be easily verified using eq .",

( 6.19 ) , then give a formula for the string mass .    in the case of ordinary @xmath286 de sitter space , the first order perturbations , eq .",
    "( 6.14 ) , are determined by @xcite : @xmath287 for @xmath288 the frequencies become imaginary and classical instabilities develop . after solving the second order perturbation equations , eqs .",
    "( 6.15)-(6.16 ) , the mass formula is found @xcite : @xmath289 after quantization one finds that real mass states can only be defined up to some maximal mass @xcite .",
    "this is reminiscent of the classical string instabilities in de sitter space . in ordinary anti de sitter space and in the @xmath0 black hole ads ( which is locally , but not globally , ads ) the first order perturbation equations and mass formula",
    "take the form of eqs .",
    "( 6.21)-(6.22 ) , but with @xmath290 replaced by @xmath291 ( or @xmath292 depending on notation ) .",
    "it follows that in these cases there are no instabilities neither classically nor quantum mechanically .",
    "the perturbation series approach is perfectly well - defined in these cases .",
    "it is interesting to compare the @xmath0 black hole ads with ordinary @xmath286 black hole ads . in secs .",
    "4,5 we found that the circular string motion is very similar in these backgrounds ( see table ii ) .",
    "this was actually somewhat surprising since the backgrounds are really very different : the ordinary black holes have a strong curvature singularity at @xmath293 the @xmath0 black hole ads has not .",
    "the circular strings are however very special configurations and that could be the reason why we did not really see any qualitative differences . for generic strings we would expect some differences , however , and that is indeed what we find when using the string perturbation series approach . in the ordinary black hole ads",
    "spacetime the first order perturbation equations become @xcite : @xmath294 @xmath295 for the transverse and longitudinal perturbations , respectively . for the transverse perturbations , eq .",
    "( 6.23 ) , the bracket is always positive , thus the frequencies are real and no instabilities arise , not even for @xmath296 for the longitudinal perturbations , on the other hand , the bracket can be negative . in that case",
    "imaginary frequencies develop .",
    "the ( @xmath297)-instability sets in at : @xmath298 the higher modes develop instabilities for smaller @xmath299 i.e. closer to the singularity .",
    "similar results are obtained in the black string background @xcite , see table iii .",
    "we have studied the string propagation in de sitter and black hole backgrounds .",
    "the main part of the talk concerned the dynamics of circular strings in de sitter space , with special interest in the physical interpretation of the results of the mathematical analysis .",
    "we then compared with results obtained in various black hole backgrounds ( @xmath0 bh - ads , schwarzschild - anti de sitter , schwarzschild - de sitter ) .",
    "finally , more insight about the strings in curved spacetimes was obtained using the string perturbation series approach .",
