    "<S> the corrections of gluon fusion to the dglap and bfkl equations are discussed in a united partonic framework . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting nonlinear evolution equations are the well - known glr - mq - zrs equation and a new evolution equation . using the available saturation models as input , we find that the new evolution equation has the chaos solution with positive lyaponov exponents in the perturbative range . </S>",
    "<S> we predict a new kind of shadowing caused by chaos , which blocks the qcd evolution in a critical small @xmath0 range . </S>",
    "<S> the blocking effect in the evolution equation may explain the abelian gluon assumption and even influence our expectations to the projected large hadron electron collider ( lhec ) , very large hadron collider ( vlhc ) and the upgrade ( cppc ) in a circular @xmath1 collider ( sppc ) .    </S>",
