    "the predictions of quantum physics are extremely well reproduced in experiments all over the world for almost a century .",

    "those effects forbid a local interpretation of physical reality , that is at the core of classical physics .",
    "once one accepts a radical departure form classical realism , it becomes quite puzzling that quantum physics is unnecessary when describing macroscopic phenomena , because there is no explicit quantum to classical transition mechanism within quantum theory itself .",
    "there are two ways to tackle this problem .    from one side ,",
    "there are attempts to derive a new theory that reproduces quantum and classical physics as two asymptotic cases .",

    "decoherence @xcite is usually given as a solution : a system unavoidably interacts with its environment , which measures its state and destroys the quantum correlations .",
    "it is argued that decoherence is more and more important when the `` size of the system '' increases , in such a way that in practice no quantum property can be observed in `` large systems '' .",
    "another possibility is to blame the measurement @xcite . here",
    ", the central intuition is that revealing entanglement in a `` large system '' requires measurements with an extreme precision .",
    "the two approaches are closely related , since a decoherence channel can be seen as acting on the observable , spoiling the accuracy of the measurement .",
    "a lot of examples have been presented in the literature confirming the general intuition that the quantum features of `` macroscopic '' states are very fragile with respect to experimental imperfections ( uncontrolled interactions with the environment and imperfect measurements ) and therefore extremely hard to observe .    in this letter",
    ", we go beyond concrete examples and put this intuition in a quantitative form .",
    "naturally , the first step is to elucidate the meaning of `` macroscopic quantum state '' , that is not obvious . indeed , measuring the size of a quantum state ( either a superposition or an entangled state ) is at the heart of many recent papers @xcite , which result in various definitions , but they are not easily connected to decoherence / measurement inaccuracy . here",

    "entanglement is reduced by experimental defects , namely by noise that we identify with a weak measurement @xcite of the observable that is coarse - grained ( for limited resolution ) , or by loss ( for limited sensitivity ) .",
