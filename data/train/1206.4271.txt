    "one of the fundamental problems in real algebraic geometry concerns the solutions of systems of real algebraic equations . since , in general , even the existence of real solutions is not guaranteed , it is important to find a priori lower bounds for the number of these solutions .    in the last years",
    "several important developments have taken place in this direction , which are related to problems in enumerative geometry @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , or to the study of certain polynomial systems which often have interesting applications @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in many cases",
    "these lower bounds are provided by the degrees of certain maps , for instance central projections of projective submanifolds @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . for a projective @xmath1-dimensional submanifold @xmath2 , and a central projection @xmath3 whose center does not intersect @xmath4 , one gets a finite map @xmath5 whose degree with respect to complex orientations coincides with the number of points of a fibre @xmath6 if multiplicities are taken into account .",
    "note that this fibre can be regarded as the set of solutions of a system of homogeneous algebraic equations .",
    "this degree can also be identified with the number of points of the intersection @xmath7 for a general codimension @xmath1 projective subspace @xmath8 ; hence it is cohomologically determined and independent of the choice of the central projection @xmath9 ( as long as its center does not intersect @xmath4 ) .",
    "this is an important example of the fundamental principle of _ conservation of numbers_. it is well known that this principle does not hold in real algebraic geometry .",
    "one of the goals of this article is to show that in real geometry , this principle should be replaced by a _ wall crossing formula_. such wall crossing formulae play an important role in gauge theory @xcite @xcite , but apparently the wall crossing phenomenon ( jump of an invariant in a well controlled way ) has not been studied until now in real algebraic geometry .",
    "the general principle of wall crossing is very simple : one has a parameter space @xmath10 which parameterizes a certain class of maps , and a wall @xmath11 of _ bad _ maps .",
    "if certain conditions are fulfilled , one can define a degree map @xmath12 which associates to any chamber @xmath13 an integer .",
    "a wall crossing formula computes the difference @xmath14 between the integers associated to two adjacent chambers . in this article",
    "we will prove such a wall crossing formula for the space of central projections restricted to a smooth , _ not necessarily algebraic _",
    "submanifold @xmath4 of a real projective space .",
    "we are not aware of any systematic results in this generality .",
    "note in particular that standard algebro - geometric techniques like e.g. elimination theory , do not apply .    the crucial assumption on the class of maps we consider is _ relative orientability _ ,",
    "a condition which allows us to define a @xmath0-valued degree map in a coherent way .",
    "this wall crossing phenomenon for real central projections @xmath15 pointed out by our result is in striking contrast to the invariance of the degree of a section in a relatively oriented vector bundle ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we describe now briefly the results of this article : + in the first section we introduce the important notion of relative orientation of a map between topological manifolds , and we define the degree of a relatively oriented map between closed manifolds of the same dimension . for relatively _ orientable",
    "_ maps @xmath16 ( so for maps which can be relatively oriented , but have not been endowed with a relative orientation ) one can define the absolute degree @xmath17 , which is similar to kronecker s concept of _ characteristic _ and hopf s _ absolute degree_. in the differentiable case the degree of a relatively oriented map can be computed using the local degrees at the points of a finite fibre .",
    "the special case of a real finite holomorphic map @xmath18 between real complex manifolds of the same dimension is particularly important .",
    "if the restriction @xmath19 is relatively orientable , then there are fundamental estimates and comparison formulae for the sum of the multiplicities of the points of a real fibre @xmath20 , @xmath21 : @xmath22 @xmath23    in the second section we study central projections .",
