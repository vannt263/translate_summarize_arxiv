    "large galaxy redshift surveys reveal that the universe has a salient weblike structure , called the cosmic web @xcite .",
    "galaxies and matter in the universe are arranged into a complex weblike network of dense compact clusters , elongated filaments , weak two - dimensional sheets , and huge near - empty voids .",
    "the cosmic web is one of the most intriguing and striking patterns found in nature , rendering its analysis and characterisation far from trivial .",
    "the absence of objective and quantitative procedures for identifying and isolating clusters , filaments , sheets , and voids in the large - scale matter distribution has been a major obstacle in investigating the structure and dynamics of the cosmic web . on the other hand , identification and quantitative description of the details of the cosmic web",
    "is important for a broad range of cosmological issues .",
    "it contains information about the structure formation physics , and is a rich source of information on the global cosmology .",
    "the evolution , structure , and dynamics of the cosmic web depend on the nature of dark matter and dark energy , and on the properties of the initial density fluctuations generated in the very early universe .",
    "thus , these factors must have left their imprint on the web , on its geometry and topology .",
    "thus probes of the large scale structure , such as wide and deep galaxy surveys , enable us to test current physical and cosmological theories and improve our understanding of the universe .    from an observational point of view",
    "there is clear evidence that certain observed properties of galaxies correlate with their environment .",
    "for example , the morphology - density relation stipulates that elliptical galaxies are found preferentially in crowded environments and spiral galaxies are found in the field @xcite .",
    "the same kind of correlation can be found in terms of the colours and morphology of galaxies @xcite , their star formation histories , and ages .",
    "usually , in environmental studies only the local or global density is used , but various indications argue for a more intricate connection @xcite . while all morphological types of galaxies correspond to a well - defined range in density , this alone is not sufficient to differentiate between them : the connection between density and morphology is more intricate .",
    "it is also known that the spin of dark matter haloes is correlated with the underlying web elements @xcite .",
    "observations indicate that the rotation axes of galaxies are aligned with galaxy filaments @xcite . comparing the properties of galaxies with the structure of the cosmic web yield valuable information about the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "galaxy maps are visually dominated by filaments .",
    "filaments are traced by galaxies and groups and often occupy the regions between massive clusters @xcite , however , filaments can also be located in voids @xcite .",
    "the prominent filamentary channels may contain up to 40% of the matter in the universe @xcite .",
    "also , theoretical studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have suggested that around half of the warm gas in the universe , presumably accounting for the low - redshift missing baryons @xcite , is hidden in filaments .",
    "translating the visual impression of the cosmic web into an algorithm that classifies the local geometry into different environments is not a trivial task , and much work is being done in this direction .",
    "@xcite gives a good overview about the various structure finding algorithms currently available . among them",
    "are the algorithms based on the gravitational tidal tensor  the hessian of the gravitational potential @xcite , on the velocity field @xcite , _ skeleton analysis _ @xcite , _ watershed segmentation _",
    "@xcite , the tessellations @xcite , bayesian sampling of the density field @xcite , minimal spanning tree @xcite , and multi - scale probability mapping @xcite .",
    "all these methods are based on different assumptions and provide different results .",
    "of course , any environment finder should be evaluated by its merits .",
    "a good algorithm should provide a quantitative classification which agrees with the visual impression and it should be based on a robust and well - defined numerical scheme .    in this work , the detection of filaments is performed using a marked point process with interactions , called bisous model @xcite .",
    "this model approximates the filamentary network by a random configuration of small segments or cylinders that interact and connect while building the network .",
    "the model was already successfully applied to observational data and to mock catalogues @xcite .",
    "the filaments found in these papers delineate well the filaments detected by eye and they were evaluated by monte carlo statistical tests .",
    "this approach has the advantage that it works directly with the original point process and does not require smoothing to create a continuous density field .",
    "our method can be applied to relatively poorly sampled data sets , as the galaxy maps are ; it can be applied both to observations and simulations . some of the previously mentioned methods can be applied only to simulations , which makes their use limited .    here",
    ", our marked point process methodology is adapted in order to apply it to the sdss data set .",
    "based on the detection obtained using the bisous model , filament spines are extracted and a filaments catalogue is built .",
    "this compiled data can be further used in order to study the properties of filaments and galaxies therein , and their relationship with galaxy clusters .",
    "most of all the previously cited filaments detection methods are based on the calculus of some gradient , statistics or other measures characterising locally the filament , followed by a merging , tracking or filtering procedure .",
    "the main advantage of using a marked point process methodology is that it comes freely with a natural way of integration provided by the probability theory . in this way a simultaneous morphological and statistical characterisation of the filamentary pattern",
    "is allowed .",
    "completing this approach with the spine detection , connects this probabilistic methodology with the richness and the efficiency of the deterministic techniques already developed .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sections  [ sect : data ] and [ sect : tools ] we describe the data used and the mathematical tools . in section  [ sec : extract_fils ] we define how we build the simulation and extract the spines of filaments . in sections  [ sect :",
    "results ] and [ sect : discussion ] we present and discuss our results .",
    "the description of the catalogue is given in appendix  [ app:1 ] .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume the wmap cosmology : the hubble constant @xmath3 , the matter density @xmath4 and the dark energy density @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "our present study is based on the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release  8 @xcite .",
    "the galaxy redshifts are typically accurate to @xmath6 , making it ideal for studies of the large - scale structure .",
    "we use only the main contiguous area of the survey ( the legacy survey ) and the spectroscopic galaxy sample as compiled in @xcite . the lower petrosian magnitude limit for this sample is set to @xmath7 , since for fainter galaxies , the spectroscopic sample is incomplete @xcite . to exclude the local supercluster from the sample , the lower cmb - corrected distance limit @xmath8",
    "the upper limit was set to @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , since at larger distances the sample becomes very diluted .",
    "the sample includes 499340 galaxies .    due to the peculiar velocities of galaxies , which introduce doppler effects in the redshift measurement @xcite",
    ", the compact structures in redshift - space are elongated along the line of sight .",
    "this is the so - called _ finger - of - god effect _ , as first introduced by @xcite . to find the filamentary structure in the sdss data",
    ", we have to suppress first the redshift distortions for groups . for that we use the friends - of - friends ( fof ) groups compiled in @xcite ; the details of the group finding algorithm",
    "are explained in @xcite .",
    "we spherize the groups using the rms sizes of galaxy groups in the sky and their rms radial velocities as described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the method is similar to that proposed by @xcite .",
    "such a compression will lead to a better estimate of the density field and can help to find the real filamentary structure .",
    "nevertheless , this compression may suppress some of the line - of - sight filaments , since the friend - of - friend group finding algorithms can not distinguish between groups and exactly line - of - sight filaments .",
    "thus , unique recovery of the real - space structures is generally not possible .",
    "we note that in principle the redshift - space distortions can be modelled more accurately , introducing a density - dependent peculiar velocity sampling scheme @xcite .",
    "however , we defer this to future work , since this will affect only a small number of filaments .",
    "to define the filamentary structure , we use cartesian coordinates based on the sdss angular coordinates @xmath11 and @xmath12 , allowing the most efficient placing of the galaxy sample cone inside a brick : we used the same coordinates to define the superclusters of galaxies in @xcite .",
    "the galaxy coordinates are calculated as follows : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the finger - of - god suppressed co - moving distance to a galaxy .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a more detailed description of the galaxy sample .",
    "in this section we describe the main tools we use to study and extract the filamentary pattern of the galaxy distribution in the universe .",
    "first of all , a very short and intuitive definition of marked point processes is given .",
    "for a rigorous study of this subject we recommend as a starting point @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "next , our marked point process based methodology is presented .",
    "this methodology includes : the construction of the bisous model , a simulation algorithm , and an optimisation procedure . for a detailed mathematical description together with the necessary convergence proofs of the method",
    ", we recommend @xcite .",
    "point processes are random configuration of points .",
    "if the points are labelled using a random mark , we speak about a marked point process",
    ". if the marks are the characteristics of a random geometrical object , we may say that we have an object point process .",
    "these processes were used by  @xcite to study the spatial distribution of galaxies .",
    "the observed galaxies were seen as the realisation of a marked point process , as follows .",
    "the centres of the galaxies were the locations in a point process , whereas the different characteristics of the galaxies ( mass , luminosity , etc . ) were the marks associated to the corresponding locations .",
    "the marked point processes mathematical framework allowed the authors to describe the galaxy population , to define statistical descriptors , and to derive the corresponding estimators @xcite .",
    "the simplest marked point process is the poisson process . in this process",
    "the number of points is chosen according to a poisson distribution , while the points are spread independently uniform in the location space where the marked process lives .",
    "then , to each point a mark is attached independently identically distributed with respect to the marks distribution .",
    "the previous process is called simple , because the independence assumption involves no interaction between objects .",
    "such interactions can be defined by means of a probability density with respect to the reference measure given by the unit intensity marked poisson point process @xcite .",
    "the marked point process we propose for filamentary detection is different from the ones already used in cosmology .",
    "in fact , we do not model the galaxies , but the structure outlined by the galaxy positions .",
    "let @xmath15 be a cosmological sample of finite volume @xmath16 , where a finite number of galaxies are observed .",
    "the galaxies positions are measured in cartesian coordinates . for sdss the eq .",
    "( [ eq : coordin ] ) defines the coordinates .",
    "the feature we are interested in is the filamentary network outlined by the galaxies positions .",
    "the main hypothesis of our work is that the filamentary network is made of a random configuration of connected and aligned cylinders , that is the realisation of a marked point process .",
    "this marked point process is named bisous model and it was specially designed to generate and analyse random spatial patterns @xcite .",
    "we assume that locally , galaxies may be grouped together inside a rather small cylinder .",
    "we also assume that such small cylinders may combine to form a filament if neighbouring cylinders are aligned in similar directions .",
    "so , the elements of our marked point process are the centres of the cylinders and their corresponding geometrical shapes .",
    "cylinders are located in the same volume where galaxies are .",
    "a cylinder is an object characterised by its centre @xmath17 and shape parameters .",
    "the shape parameters of a cylinder are the radius @xmath18 , the length @xmath19 , and the orientation vector @xmath20 .",
    "the radius is considered fixed .",
    "the length varies uniformly within the interval @xmath21 $ ] that will be specified later in this paper .",
    "the orientation vector parameters @xmath22 are uniformly distributed on @xmath23 $ ] , such that @xmath24 hence , the mark of our process is given by @xmath25 \\times [ 0,2\\pi ) \\times [ 0,1]$ ] and its attached uniform distribution @xmath26 .",
    "we denote the cylinder by @xmath27 .",
    "two extremity rigid points ( end points ) are attached to each cylinder @xmath28 . around each of these points",
    "a sphere of the radius @xmath29 is centred .",
    "these two spheres form an attraction region that are used to define connectivity and alignment rules for cylinders ( see sect .",
    "[ sect : intenergy ] ) .",
    "we illustrate the basic cylinder in fig .",
    "[ fig : cylinder ] , where it is centred at the coordinate origin and its symmetry axis is parallel to the @xmath30-axis .",
    "the coordinates of the end points are @xmath31 and the orientation vector is @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath33 be a configuration of cylinders , where @xmath34 denotes the mark .",
    "the unit intensity independently marked poisson process constructs a configuration of cylinders as follows .",
    "first , the number @xmath35 of cylinders is chosen according to a poisson law of parameter @xmath36 .",
    "then the lengths and the orientation vectors are chosen independently following @xmath26 .",
    "such a configuration has only very few connected and aligned cylinders .",
    "this effect is just a chance product . in order to obtain random configurations made of connected and aligned cylinders , a model defined by a probability density",
    "is needed .",
    "such a probability density is specified with respect to the reference poisson process and it can be written @xmath37}{z(\\theta ) }      \\label{eq : probability}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the normalising constant , @xmath39 is the vector of the model parameters , and @xmath40 is the energy function of the system ( its equivalent in physics is the total gibbs energy of a system ) .",
    "we assumed above that locally , galaxies may be grouped together inside a rather small cylinder , and such small cylinders may combine to form a filament if neighbouring cylinders are aligned in similar directions .",
    "following these two ideas the energy function in  ( [ eq : probability ] ) can be specified as : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the data energy ( see sect .  [",
    "sect : dataenergy ] ) and @xmath43 is the interaction energy ( see sect .  [",
    "sect : intenergy ] ) associated with the first and second assumptions above , respectively . in fact , the data energy is related to the position of the cylinders in the galaxy field , whereas the interaction energy is related to the alignment and connection of the cylinders constructing the filamentary pattern .",
    "being in the possession of the model , the parameters have to be chosen . here , the bayesian framework is adopted and the parameters are described by a prior law @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "this allows us to write the joint estimator of the filamentary pattern and the parameters as @xmath45 where @xmath46/z_\\mathrm{p}(\\theta)$ ] is the prior law for the model parameters and @xmath47 is the model parameters space .",
    "the bayesian framework was preferred , since we believe , that for the problem at hand , it is much more natural to give a characterisation of the parameters by a probabilistic law , instead of a fixed value .",
    "nevertheless , even in this case , some tuning of the model based on trial and error , is needed .",
    "the solution we obtain is not unique . in practise",
    ", the shape of the prior law @xmath44 may influence the solution , making the result to look more random compared with a result obtained for fixed values of parameters .",
    "therefore , we have derived tools that are able to average the obtained solution and to state that the obtained results are really due to the data , and not to a random effect of the presented methodology @xcite .",
    "full details concerning the set - up of the method and the analysis of the results obtained are given later in this paper .",
    "the paper continues with the presentation of the energy terms , the simulation technique , and an optimisation algorithm .",
    "the data energy term is related to the local definition of a galactic filament .",
    "this is still an important open problem . here , we consider that locally , the galaxies positions form a filament , if they are situated inside a rather small cylinder , while fulfilling simultaneously several criteria .",
    "the first one is that the galaxies positions should be spread more or less uniformly a long the main symmetry axis of the cylinder .",
    "the second one is that inside a cylinder there should be more galaxies than outside of it , that is inside the close - by neighbourhood of the cylinder . and",
    "finally , in order to avoid some clustering effect , the galaxies forming the filaments should be encouraged to get aligned as much as possible along the main symmetry axis of the cylinder .    under these circumstances ,",
    "the data energy of a configuration of cylinders @xmath48 is defined as the sum of the energy contributions corresponding to each cylinder : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the potential function associated with the cylinder @xmath51 .",
    "this potential takes into account the previously mentioned criteria and it depends on @xmath52 ( the field of galaxies ) and the model parameters given by @xmath39 .    in order to give a mathematical description of these requirements , an extra cylinder is attached to each cylinder @xmath51 , with exactly the same parameters as @xmath51 , except for the radius which equals @xmath53 .",
    "let @xmath54 be the shadow of @xmath28 obtained by the subtraction of the initial cylinder from the bigger cylinder .",
    "the cylinder and its shadow are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cylinder ] .",
    "then , we divide each cylinder into three equal volumes along its main symmetry axis , and denote by @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 their corresponding shapes .",
    "let us assume that locally the number of galaxies inside and around a cylinder , follows a poisson distribution .",
    "the first criteria requires the `` local uniform spread '' of the galaxies along the main symmetry axis of the cylinder . under the poissonian assumption ,",
    "let @xmath58 be the intensity parameters of the corresponding distributions for the shape regions @xmath59 .",
    "if the underlying poissonian process is stationary , `` local uniform spread '' requires all the @xmath60 to be equal .",
    "however , filaments are lumpy by nature ",
    "e.g. , the filaments in @xcite and the well - known perseus chain @xcite . to take this into account",
    ", we relax the uniformity assumption by requiring @xmath61 to be smaller than chosen threshold .",
    "for any two regions @xmath59 and @xmath62 with @xmath63 , a statistical test can be done to compare @xmath60 and @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "the test is @xmath65 for all pairs of indices @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is a given threshold value .",
    "now , for a given pair @xmath68 , the observed number of galaxies in @xmath59 and @xmath62 is @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "then , the @xmath71-value for this test is computed using a binomial law of parameters @xmath72 and @xmath73 as follows @xmath74 six such tests are necessary to verify the `` local uniform spread '' condition .",
    "the obtained score is @xmath75 notice , that this global test is equivalent with verifying @xmath76 with @xmath77 .",
    "hence , it guarantees a minimum density for the galaxies inside a cylinder cell .",
    "the second criteria demands for `` locally high density '' of galaxies inside of a cylinder comparing to the density of galaxies in the close - by neighbourhood of the cylinder . under the poissonian assumption ,",
    "the test is @xmath78 with @xmath79 a given threshold value .",
    "it is important to notice that the volumes ratio of @xmath28 and @xmath54 plays an important role in choosing the appropriate value of @xmath79 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath80 this tests if the two processes have the same intensity , if @xmath81 this tests if the intensity inside the cylinder is three times higher than inside its shadow .",
    "if the observed number of galaxies inside @xmath28 and @xmath54 is @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively , the @xmath71-value of the test is computed using a binomial distribution of parameters @xmath35 and @xmath84 @xmath85    to take into account both tests simultaneously , the following score is defined @xmath86    the previous tests are based on counts of points in some pre - defined regions . in order to take into account the spatial distribution of galaxies in a cylinder we define the cylinder concentration as @xmath87 with @xmath35 the number of galaxies covered by the cylinder , @xmath88 the distance from the @xmath89th galaxy inside the cylinder to its main symmetry axis , and @xmath18 is the cylinder radius .",
    "the weight @xmath90 is chosen to eliminate some pathological cases with too few points covered by a cylinder ( there must be at least three galaxies inside a cylinder ) .",
    "clearly , the concentration @xmath91 has a minimum when the symmetry axis of the cylinder coincides with the least mean square line passing through the cloud of points , given by the galaxy positions inside the cylinder .",
    "it is important to notice that the use of this term may induce a local gaussian assumption .",
    "this may be considered contradictory to the poisson hypothesis previously used .",
    "nevertheless , the use of these two strategies is complementary : the first two requirements impose conditions on the number of galaxies inside a cylinder , while the third one imposes conditions on the spatial distribution of these galaxies .",
    "the term given by  ( [ eq : cylindervariance ] ) is also a very good indicator of a locally high density and a better estimator for the filament axis .",
    "the potential function @xmath50 of the cylinder is built using the previous statistical tests and criteria .",
    "let us assume that for the cylinder @xmath51 , the @xmath71-value @xmath92 is computed as previously , and let @xmath93 be the cylinder concentration .",
    "we want @xmath50 to be maximum for the `` best '' location of the cylinder in the galaxy field .",
    "this allows the definition of the potential function as @xmath94 & \\text{if } \\quad n \\geq n_\\mathrm{min } \\\\",

    ", the formula   suggests @xmath96 .",
    "the parameter @xmath97 is required to make the two terms comparable : this allows to use these two strategies safely together .",
    "this gives for the data energy defined by eq .",

    "since the number of galaxies is finite and since the observed window has a limited volume , the term @xmath91 is always finite .",
    "therefore , the data term model is locally stable , hence it designs a well defined model that has an integrable probability density .",
    "one more point has to be retained concerning the data term .",
    "the use of @xmath71-values for constructing a potential function is different of the use of the values for `` purely '' statistical tests . in this last situation bonferroni or idk",

    "the variables @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the potentials associated with these configurations , respectively .",
    "the interaction energy ( [ eq : intenergy ] ) is defined in the same way as in @xcite .",
    "two cylinders are considered repulsive , if they are rejecting each other and if they are not orthogonal .",
