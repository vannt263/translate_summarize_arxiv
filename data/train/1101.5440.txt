    "this manuscript has been written in an effort toward pedagogy , privileging clarity over details , physical pictures over mathematical developments .",
    "we hope it can be used as an introduction to the berk - breizman problem and its numerical computation",
    ". however we can not pretend being able to introduce notions such as nuclear fusion , magnetic plasma confinement , magneto - hydrodynamics ( mhd ) , kinetic theory , tokamak geometry , or particle orbits , with as much clarity as in well - known textbooks .",
    "for this reason , the reader is assumed to be familiar with the basis of the above fields . in this introduction",
    "we expose the background and motivation for our work .      in an ignited tokamak operating with a deuterium - tritium mix ,",
    "the confinement of @xmath3-particles is critical to prevent damages on the first - wall and to achieve break - even .",
    "the reason is that these high energy particles must be kept long enough in the plasma core to allow enough of their energy to heat thermal populations by slowing - down processes .",
    "a major concern is that high energy ions can excite plasma instabilities in the frequency range of alfvn eigenmodes ( aes ) , which significantly enhance their transport .",
    "ever since the recognition of this issue in the 1970 s , considerable progress has been made in the theoretical understanding of the principal alfvnic instabilities .",
    "however , the estimation of the mode growth rate is complex , and the question of their stability in iter @xcite remains to be clarified .",
    "in addition , estimation of the effect on transport and development of diagnostics and control schemes require significant progress on our understanding of nonlinear behaviors .",
    "we limit our framework to the tokamak configuration . in this work ,",
    "we focus our interest on the toroidicity induced alfvn eigenmode ( tae ) @xcite , which is a shear - alfvn wave ( saw ) located in a gap of the saw continuum that is created by toroidal coupling of two successive poloidal modes , and which can be destabilized by resonant interactions with high - energy ions .",
    "taes have been observed to be driven by @xmath3-particles in burning plamas @xcite , ion - cyclotron - resonance heating ( icrh ) @xcite , and neutral beam injection ( nbi ) @xcite . in this work",
    "we consider only the latter situation ( nbi - driven taes ) .      in general , taes",
    "are described in a three - dimensional ( 3d ) configuration space . however , near a phase - space surface where the resonance condition is satisfied ( resonant phase - space surface ) , it is possible to obtain a new set of variables in which the perturbation is described by a one - dimensional ( 1d ) effective hamiltonian in 2 conjugated variables @xcite , if we assume an isolated single mode . in this sense ,",
    "the problem of kinetic interactions between taes and fast - particles is homothetic to a simple 1d single mode bump - on - tail instability .",
    "the so - called berk - breizman ( bb ) problem @xcite is a generalization of the bump - on - tail problem , where we take into account an external wave damping accounting for background dissipative mechanisms , and a collision operator",
    ". observed qualitative and quantitative similarities between bb nonlinear theory and both global tae simulations @xcite and experiments @xcite are an indication of the validity of this reduction of dimensionality .",
    "similar arguments exist for other alfvn wave instabilities such as the geodesic acoustic mode ( gam ) @xcite , and the beta alfvn eigenmode ( bae ) @xcite .",
    "these analogies enable more understanding of fully nonlinear problems in complex geometries by using a model that is analytically and numerically tractable .",
    "this approach is complementary to heavier 3d analysis .",
    "a feature of the nonlinear evolution of aes , the frequency sweeping ( chirping ) of the resonant frequency by 10 - 30@xmath4 on a timescale much faster than the equilibrium evolution , has been observed in the plasma core region of tokamaks jt-60 upgrade ( jt-60u ) @xcite , diii - d @xcite , the small tight aspect ratio tokamak ( start ) @xcite , the mega amp spherical tokamak ( mast ) @xcite , the national spherical torus experiment ( nstx ) @xcite , and in stellerators such as the large helical device ( lhd ) @xcite , and the compact helical stellerator ( chs ) @xcite . in general , two branches",
    "coexist , with their frequency sweeping downwardly ( down - chirping ) for one , upwardly ( up - chirping ) for the other . in many experiments ,",
    "asymmetric chirping has been observed , with the amplitude of down - chirping branches significantly dominating up - chirping ones .",
    "chirping taes have been reproduced in 3d simulations with a hybrid mhd / drift - kinetic code @xcite , and with a drift - kinetic perturbative code @xcite .",
    "qualitatively similar chirping modes are spontaneously generated by the bb model , and have been shown to correspond to the evolution of holes and clumps in the velocity distribution .",
    "theory relates the time evolution of the frequency shift with the linear drive @xmath5 and the external damping rate @xmath6 @xcite , when the evolution of holes and clumps is adiabatic . the idea of using chirping velocity ( or sweeping rate ) as a diagnostic for growth rates looks promising .",
    "if we assume that the mode is close to marginal stability , @xmath7 , and if we further assume that holes and clumps are in the adiabatic regime , then the growth rates are simply obtained by fitting analytic prediction to experimental measurement of chirping velocity .",
    "however , these two assumptions are not verified in general , which limits the applicability of this simple approach .",
    "in most experiments , chirping events are quasi - periodic , with a period in the order of the millisecond . on the one hand ,",
    "the long - time simulation of repetitive chirping with 3d codes is a heavy task , which has not been undertaken yet . on the other hand , simulations of the bb model with many chirping events",
    "have been performed @xcite , but such solutions do not feature any quasi - periodicity . in this sense ,",
    "repetitive chirping that qualitatively agrees with an experiment has not been reproduced , neither with 1d nor 3d simulations .",
    "our main goals are to improve our understanding of wave - particle nonlinear resonant interactions , develop diagnostics and identify control parameters for aes . from these backgrounds ,",
    "a straight - forward plan is to :    * clarify the link between bb model and aes , * extend bb theory where it is insufficient to explain experimental observations , * analyze experimental data by applying the bb model to aes .      in brief , we reduce the problem of taes to a numerically and analytically tractable paradigm , the bb problem .",
    "we make a survey of linear and nonlinear physics of the bb model , and work on improving our understanding , by extending theory and by using systematic numerical observations , focusing on the frequency sweeping regime .",
    "armed with new findings and robust numerical tools , we finally go back to the original problem of taes , explaining quantitative features of experimental observations , and developing a new method for accurate linear predictions .    in chap .",
    "[ ch : tae ] , we review the physics of the tae , and simplify the description of the problem from 6d to 2d in phase - space , around a single resonant phase - space surface . the first step in this procedure is to isolate the gyromotion , which is decoupled from the wave for typical taes with @xmath8 khz , by changing variables to the guiding - center coordinates .",
    "this change of variables is based on the so - called lie transform perturbation theory , which we review in order to get a better grasp of involved hypothesis .",
    "then we show how to reduce the guiding - center hamiltonian , as well as collision operator and background mechanisms , and discuss limitations of this simplified description . in chap .",
    "[ ch : bbmodel ] , we review basic nonlinear physics of the bb problem .",
    "we develop and verify numerical tools that we use in following chapters .",
    "in particular , we develop and verify a kinetic code to solve the initial - value problem .",
    "we show that numerical simulations in experimentally relevant conditions , with cold - bulk and weak , warm - beam distributions , require a careful choice of advection scheme . among the family of so - called constrained interpolation profile ( cip ) schemes , a locally conservative version ( cip - csl )",
    "displays the best convergence properties . as an intermediate summary",
    ", we cast the analogies between bb model and 1d description of taes . in chap .",
    "[ ch : nonlinearities ] , we investigate kinetic features of self - consistent interactions between an energetic particle beam and a weakly unstable electrostatic wave in 1d plasma , within the bb framework , with an emphasis on chirping regime and subcritical instabilities .",
    "we show that the nonlinear time - evolution of chirping in 1d simulations can be used to retrieve information about linear input parameters with good precision .",
    "we identify a regime where chirping events are quasi - periodical .",
    "this regime exists whether the collision model is annihilation / creation type , or takes into account dynamical friction and velocity - space diffusion .",
    "based on these findings , in chap .",
    "[ ch : experiment ] , we propose a new method to estimate local linear drive , external damping , and collision frequencies from the spectrogram of magnetic field variations measured by a mirnov coil at the edge of the plasma .",
    "this method , which relies on a fitting of normalized chirping characteristics between the experiment and bb simulations , is described and applied to tae experiments in mast and jt-60u .",
    "we show that the bb model can successfully reproduce features observed in the experiment only if the collision operator includes drag and diffusion terms .",
    "we find a quantitative agreement for the diffusion frequency , and a qualitative agreement for the drag frequency , between the values obtained with our fitting procedure , and an independent estimation obtained from experimental equilibrium measurements . in the conclusion ( chap .",
    "[ ch : conclusion ] ) , we summarize our findings , and we suggest numerical and experimental investigations these findings enable .",
    "the tae is a shear - alfvn wave located in a gap of the saw continuum that is created by toroidal coupling of two successive poloidal modes , which can be destabilized by energetic particles .",
    "this chapter deals with the modelization at several levels of complexity of an isolated single - mode tae . in sec .",
    "[ sec : review_tae ] , we give a short review of the basic tae physics , and of the state - of - the - art of its linear stability analysis , emphasizing a need for improved accuracy .",
    "when the tae is an isolated single - mode , it is possible to reduce the problem to a simple harmonic oscillator , by expanding the perturbed hamiltonian around a resonant phase - space surface .",
    "this reduction from 3d to 1d becomes particularly transparent in angle - action variables ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) , once the perturbation has been put in the form @xmath11 , where @xmath12 are integers . in sec .",
    "[ sec : gyrokinetic_tae ] , we show how to obtain the latter form .",

    "<S> the achievement of sustained nuclear fusion in magnetically confined plasma relies on efficient confinement of alpha particles , which are high - energy ions produced by the fusion reaction . </S>",
    "<S> such particles can excite instabilities in the frequency range of alfvn eigenmodes ( aes ) , which significantly degrade their confinement and threatens the vacuum vessel of future reactors . in order to develop diagnostics and control schemes , a better understanding of linear and nonlinear features of resonant interactions between plasma waves and high - energy particles , which is the aim of this thesis , is required . in the case of an isolated single resonance , </S>",
    "<S> the description of ae destabilization by high - energy ions is homothetic to the so - called berk - breizman ( bb ) problem , which is an extension of the classic bump - on - tail electrostatic problem , including external damping to a thermal plasma , and collisions . a semi - lagrangian simulation code , cobbles , is developed to solve the initial - value bb problem in both perturbative ( @xmath0 ) and self - consistent ( full-@xmath1 ) approaches . </S>",
    "<S> two collision models are considered , namely a krook model , and a model that includes dynamical friction ( drag ) and velocity - space diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinear behavior of instabilities in experimentally - relevant conditions is categorized into steady - state , periodic , chaotic , and frequency - sweeping ( chirping ) regimes , depending on external damping rate and collision frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the chaotic regime is shown to extend into a linearly stable region , and a mechanism that solves the paradox formed by the existence of such subcritical instabilities is proposed . </S>",
    "<S> analytic and semi - empirical laws for nonlinear chirping characteristics , such as sweeping - rate , lifetime , and asymmetry , are developed and validated . </S>",
    "<S> long - time simulations demonstrate the existence of a quasi - periodic chirping regime . although the existence of such regime stands for both collision models , drag and diffusion are essential to reproduce the alternation between major chirping events and quiescent phases , which is observed in experiments . based on these findings , </S>",
    "<S> a new method for analyzing fundamental kinetic plasma parameters , such as linear drive and external damping rate , is developed . </S>",
    "<S> the method , which consists of fitting procedures between cobbles simulations and quasi - periodic chirping ae experiments , does not require any internal diagnostics . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is applied to toroidicity - induced aes ( taes ) on jt-60 upgrade and mega - amp spherical tokamak devices , which yields estimations of local kinetic parameters and suggests the existence of taes relatively far from marginal stability . </S>",
    "<S> the results are validated by recovering measured growth and decay of perturbation amplitude , and by estimating collision frequencies from experimental equilibrium data . </S>"
