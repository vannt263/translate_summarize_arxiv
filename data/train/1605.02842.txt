    "( 2008 ) built a catalogue of more than 200 apparently interacting galaxy pairs of the m51 class , from visual identification of irsa archives , and found that a low number of the main galaxies in m51 systems are early type spirals and barred spirals and that about 70% of the main galaxies in m51 systems are 2-armed spirals .",
    "m51-type galaxies are a subset of the class of unequal mass interacting galaxy pairs , for which there is some statistical evidence based on large surveys for enhanced star formation relative to normal galaxies , particularly in the smaller of the galaxies in the pair ( e.g. , woods @xmath0 geller 2007 ; ellison et al . 2008 ) .",
    "ellison et al . ( 2008 ) , from a sample of 1716 galaxies , members of galaxy pairs from sloan digital sky survey data release 4 , found that the star - forming rate ( sfr ) enhancement can be detected for a sample of galaxy pairs whose masses are within a factor of 10 of each other .",
    "according to smith et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , a m51-like subset of arp galaxies also shows possible differences from the spirals in mid - infrared colors ; however , the m51 sample size is small , so these results are tentative .",
    "they obtain for eight m51-like systems , redder [ 8]-[24 ] , [ 3.6]-[24 ] , [ 5.8]-[8 ] colors , when compared to spirals , and therefore enhanced star formation .",
    "the estimated median sfr ( sfr derived from the 24@xmath1 m luminosity , by using the calibration from calzetti et al . 2005 ) for their small sample of m51-type galaxies resulted in 3.3 _ m@xmath2 _ yr@xmath3 , while the median for the sfr of the spirals of their control sample is of 0.9 _ m@xmath2 _ yr@xmath3 . for comparison",

    "laurikainen , salo & aparicio ( 1998 ) obtained deep broad - band bvri photometry of close interacting galaxy pairs and found that 9 of 13 m51-type pairs showed enhanced star formation in the central regions of the companions and only one pair in the nucleus of the main galaxy .",
    "klimanov @xmath0 reshetnikov ( 2001 ) , made a final selection of 32 m51-like objects from the list of vorontsov - velyaminov and performed a statistical study using photometric information from b - band of the _  digitized sky survey \" _",

    "the leda determinations for the direction of the major axis assign the same weight to the disk and to other structures as the tidal arm or bridges , so the photometric major axis could be ill defined in several cases .",
    "for this reason , we measured the photometric major axis in the r - band dss images , since this band is representative of the more evolved stellar population of the disk . table3 includes the position angle of the bars and the absolute values of the differences between the position angles of the major kinematic axis and the major photometric axis .",

    "in table4 we detail the position angle of the photometric major axis of the main galaxies , the position angle of the center of the satellites , as measured from the centers of the main galaxies , as well as the difference between these values . in figure5",
    "we show a histogram of the pa difference . about half of the sample presents pa difference smaller than 20@xmath12 , so in a statistically sense , this could suggest that satellite galaxies are closer to the main galaxy plane . for verification",

    "the fitting of our sample is flatter than the fitting of rk , due to the sample of rk including two objects of lower masses and luminosities , making their fit steeper than ours .",
    "as may be seen , the brightest galaxies are placed near the standard relation , which is compatible with the fact that for the most massive systems , the t - f relation does not depend on the environment ( barton et al .",

    "+ a similar situation is observed in the study of members of hickson compact groups of galaxies ( torres - flores et al .",
    "2013 ) , where a few low mass outlier objects deviate from the standard t - f relation for field galaxies .",
    "we noticed that these outliers are occupying the same region in the plot of the t - f relation as the low - mass m51-type galaxies .",
    "this happens for both b - band and ks - band t - f relations . according to torres - flores et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , the deviations from the standard relation could be due to a combination of a flux increment generated by the enhancement of star - forming events with the uncertainties in the determination of the kinematic widths due to kinematic distortions induced by gravitational interactions .",
    "torres - flores et al . ( 2013 ) observe for some outliers a larger deviation in ks - band than in b - band .",
    "they notice that , according to maraston ( 1998 ) , if thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch stars ( tp - agb ) are considered in stellar population synthesis models , they may make an important contribution in the k band .",
    "in particular , maraston ( 1998 ) found that this effect is significant for an evolved burst with an age of about 700 myrs . +",
    "another study of objects that are suffering gravitational interactions is that of barton et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , who determine the t - f relation for galaxy pairs .",
    "they also observe for low - mass objects an excess in the b - band flux , with respect to the one expected for standard t - f relations .",
    "these authors determined that in extreme cases the deviation from the standard t - f relation may be explained by uncertainties in inclination , in whose cases long tidal tails should be observed . since m51-type galaxies in general present long tidal tails , in our sample",
    "the effects due to indetermination in inclination could be larger than those of barton et al.s sample .",
    "barton et al .",
    "( 2001 ) also proposed that another possible explanation for the outliers is dissipative effects on the rotation curve ( gas infall and non - uniform or truncated gas emission ) .",
    "+ our m51-type galaxy sample includes low - mass objects with asymmetric curves ( e.g. : am0459 - 340 , am1304 - 333 , ngc633 ) , truncated rotation curves ( ngc633 satellite , ngc4188 ) , and star - forming enhancement ( am0459 - 340 , main and satellite galaxies of ngc633 , am1304 - 333 ) .",
    "in addition , we must take into account that in objects with well - marked signs of gravitational interactions the determination of the major axis is more tricky , possibly resulting in a underestimation of the rotation curve amplitude .",
    "a next step on this subject could be to perform a study using 3-d spectroscopy techniques .",
    "there are few low - mass m51 objects studied , so it would also be desirable to add observations of less massive systems .",
    "+      for future numerical simulations of the gravitational encounter between main and satellite galaxies ( components of a typical m51-type system ) , it is necessary to consider a representative radial velocity curve of the larger component .",
    "one possible approach is to derive a synthetic curve from the available radial velocity data for a set of main galaxies . for this purpose , we selected from our catalogue the radial distributions along major axis position angle for 13 systems ( data_a , table6 ) , retaining the systems which present less ambiguity in the determination of the major axis position angle and the inclination .",
    "the radial velocity data have been deprojected , considering the inclination of the main galaxy .",
    "being more restrictive , we excluded some systems and built two other data sets , data_b ( 11 objects ) and data_c ( 9 objects ) , being the last set of data the one with more constrained parameters , so this last set of radial velocities contains the most  trusty \" data values .",
    "the data have been normalized , in both radial velocity and position , dividing by the peak value in radial velocity , and in the case of the position , dividing by the disk extension of the main component in r - dss band . + for fitting the data , we have used the software  tablecurve \" .",
    "the functions that resulted in a best fitting for each set of data are : ` asymmetric double gaussian cumulative ' ( adc ) for data_a , ` modified gaussian ' ( gaussmod ) for data_b and ` symmetric double gaussian cumulative ' ( sdc ) for data_c .",
    "in table7 we list the coefficients of the functions that fitted the data for each set ( figure8 ) . in the same table",
    "we include the standard deviation ( @xmath8 ) . also , for each data set , and as a simple visual test of the fitting , we divided the range of normalized radial distance in different bins , obtaining an average value of normalized radial velocity for each bin .",
    "the functions obtained with the mentioned software provided a good fitting to the average values .",
    "the errors associated to the average values correspond to the standard deviation and are plotted in figure 8 .",
    "as can be seen in figure8d , there is not significant difference between the fittings of the three sets of data . + as a different approach , we have built a representative gravitational potential of the spiral galaxies corresponding to set ",
    "this spiral galaxy model consists of a disk described by an exponential law ( freeman ( 1970 ) ) , plus a dark halo represented by a nfw mass distribution ( navarro , frenk @xmath0 white 1996 ) .",
    "the choice of these potentials corresponds to the description of barnes @xmath0 hibbard ( 2009 ) for the numerical modeling of interacting disk galaxies .",
    "considering that we have obtained radial velocities from long - slit spectroscopy ( with half arcsecond uncertainties in the galaxy center position ) , the galactic centers are affected by important interstellar extinction ( underestimated radial velocities ) , and considering the seeing of the observations , we conclude that the central radial velocities have significant uncertainties . therefore , the resolution obtained for small radii is not adequate to properly trace the mass of the bulge component .",
    "consequently , we only have considered the disk and halo components from the dynamic model proposed by barnes @xmath0 hibbard ( 2009 ) . in order to resolve the well - known disk - halo conspiracy in the rotation curve description ,",
    "we have assumed the parameter relation proposed by barnes @xmath0 hibbard ( 2009 ) for both components .",
    "the best description for the circular velocities , according to the adopted model , is shown in figure9a .",

    "we have performed a second fitting of the data just beyond r=1.5 kpc , including a spherical potential ( hernquist 1990 ) , as proposed by barnes @xmath0 hibbard ( 2009 ) , which contains 5@xmath26 of the total mass and has a scale radius of 24@xmath26 respect to that of the disk component ( barnes @xmath0 hibbard 2009 ) . in this case , the fitting parameters were able to differ from the barnes @xmath0 hibbard ( 2009 ) relations in less than 25@xmath26 in mass and less than 10@xmath26 in scale radius .",
    "the mass model parameters including a bulge component are the following : m@xmath27=1.12x10@xmath22m@xmath2 , _ _ a__@xmath28=0.85kpc ; m@xmath21=3.5x10@xmath22m@xmath2 , _ _ a__@xmath23=3.5kpc ; m@xmath24(__a__@xmath25)=3.8x10@xmath22m@xmath2 ,",
    "_ _ a__@xmath25=9.5kpc .",
    "thereby , a comparison between this synthetic rotation curve and higher resolution rotation curves is possible .",
    "this synthetic rotation curve serves as a model starting point for numerical simulations of m51-type galaxies .    in order to further take into account the dispersion of observational data , we have determined two rotation curve envelopes which enclosed the individual rotation curves of set  c \" ( figure9c ) .",
    "the envelope curves keep the same scale parameters but differ in mass by 50@xmath26 .",
    "another useful description for these rotation velocities is a simple linear function fitting which could be easily compared with other samples .",
    "the linear fitting consists of two straight lines , that is , one that represents the central rigid rotation ( r@xmath182kpc ) and another which represents the flat region of the rotation curve ( r@xmath293kpc ) . in figure9d",
    "we show the fitting of both linear functions .",
    "the central region has a radial velocity gradient of 68kms@xmath3kpc@xmath3 while the flat region shows a slight increase with radius of 1.1kms@xmath3kpc@xmath3 ( this slight slope is consistent with the previous synthetic description that includes a large scale halo component ) .",
    "from the present kinematic sample consisting of 21 interacting m51-type galaxy systems , we found that the radial velocity distributions present asymmetries in about half of the studied main galaxies .",
    "typical examples are am0459 - 340 , vv410 or vv452 . in some systems",
    "a detailed scrutiny reveals subtle asymmetries : at first sight the curve of am0639 - 582 is normal , however , the observed radial velocity gradients are different in both sides of the distribution , taking as reference the position corresponding to the red continuum emission peak in the spectra .",
    "+ only am1304 - 333 has a very distorted radial velocity curve .",
    "we also observe an important morphological perturbation , which would be the result of an ongoing multiple merger . + for almost all the main galaxies that belong to the present sample , the observed perturbations are not as significant as the ones involved in fusions .",
    "in fact we found only small or moderate differences between the photometric and kinematic major axes of the main galaxies . in systems with low ratio between satellite and main galaxy masses , the systematic velocities of the satellites",
    "are a continuation of the velocity curve of the larger galaxy , which agrees with the results obtained by reshetnikov @xmath0 klimanov ( 2003 ) : the relative velocity of the satellite is approximately equal to the velocity in the outer parts of the main galaxy disk .",
    "+ m51-type galaxies have average luminosities ( log l@xmath9 @xmath30 10.5 ) that are comparable to the luminosities of the brightest objects in the nearby galaxy sample ( 451 objects ) of karachentsev et al .",
    "this may be due to a selection bias ( we are detecting only the brightest m51 galaxies ) , but the importance of this effect seems diminished by the fact that only the prototype m51 ( ngc5194@xmath3195 ) in karachentsev@xmath32s sample match the type of objects considered here , and that this prototype system is also a luminous one . the galaxy brightness in the k - band could be raised by an enhancement of the young stellar population in these galaxies , shifting the location of m51 galaxies towards lowered m / l@xmath9 ratios in the plot .",
    "this effect is seen for some less massive objects in the ks - band tully - fisher relation",
    ". therefore the m51 phenomenon happens in intrinsically massive bright spiral galaxies ( as the case of m51 itself ) , which notwithstanding have quite normal m / l@xmath9 ratios",
    ". + the b - band and k - band tully - fisher relation for these systems are flatter than the standard one derived for isolated galaxies .",
    "the same trend is observed in other interacting galaxy samples .",
    "more data of low mass objects and 3d spectroscopic studies would be desirable for improving the t - f characterization of this type of objects .",
    "+ from the kinematic data , we have derived a synthetic radial velocity distribution that serves as reference for future numerical simulations .",
    "the synthetic rotation curve is near to solid body - like inside 4 kpc , and then is nearly flat within the radial range 5 - 15 kpc .",
    "the semi - amplitude of the curve is @xmath4 190 kms@xmath3kpc@xmath3 .",
    "+ the distribution of the position angle difference between the main galaxies major axis and the segment that connects the centers of main and satellite galaxies , shows an excess of companions located towards the main galaxy major axis . a selection effect of m51 companions located nearer to the galaxy major axis can be discarded as there is no correlation with the system inclination .",
    "this indicates that in most of the systems in the m51 phase of the interaction , the companion orbit has a large projection on the main galaxy equatorial plane .",
    "consistently , the radial velocity differences between main and satellite galaxies , normalized to the peak radial velocity of the velocity distribution of the main galaxy , indicates that the orbital motion of the satellite is within the range of amplitudes of the main galaxy rotation curve .",
    "all the studied m51 systems are therefore gravitationally bound , except for one pair which seems to be a high velocity encounter .    despite the significant increase in data that resulted from the present work",
