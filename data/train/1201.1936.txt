    "the defining property of a tree is that precisely one path connects any two vertices of the tree . at various parts of the discussion",
    "we will assign labels to the vertices of the trees .",
    "_ rooted _ trees have each a special vertex ( typically labeled @xmath0 ) referred to as the _ root _ of the tree .",
    "moreover a collection of rooted trees is called a _ planted forest_. for convenience in the subsequent discussion the word `` _ _ tree _ _ '' will refer to a rooted tree while the word `` _ _ forest _ _ '' will refer to a planted forest .",
    "+ each vertex @xmath1 , is adjacent to a single vertex whose distance to the root is smaller than the distance between @xmath2 and the root .",
    "( the distance between two vertices here refers to the number of edges on the unique path connecting the two vertices . )",
    "such a vertex is called the _",
    "parent _ of @xmath2 and all other vertices adjacent to @xmath2 are called _ children _ vertices of @xmath2 . + the analogy to human family relations",
    "is extended to include notions such as _ siblings _ and _ grandparent _ relationships between vertices .",
    "we assume that such relationships between vertices are unambiguous within the current context of trees .",
    "vertices with no _ children _ are called _ leaves _ of the tree .",
    "+ finally , a label assignment to the vertices of a given tree is considered valid , if the root is labeled @xmath0 and no two sibling vertices are assigned the same label .",
    "see fig[2,3 ] .",
    "the first operation on trees that we introduce here is the _ grafting _ operation .",
    "+ let @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote two rooted trees .",
    "we say that the tree @xmath5 results from the grafting of @xmath3 onto @xmath4 denoted @xmath6 iff @xmath3 and @xmath4 are disjoint rooted subtrees of @xmath5 and most importantly @xmath5 has no other rooted subtree disjoint from the subtrees @xmath3 and @xmath4 as illustrated in fig[4 ] .",
    "+ note that , it follows from the definition that the grafting operation is commutative @xmath7 the single ",
    "vertex rooted tree ( having only the root vertex ) , can be thought to represent the neutral ( or identity ) element for the grafting operation .",
    "we write @xmath8 and @xmath9 the tree grafting operation induces a natural algebra on forests described below .",
    "+ let @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote two forests .",
    "the grafting of the forest @xmath12 onto the forest @xmath13 amounts to creating a new forest made of trees resulting from the grafting of all possible pairs of trees @xmath14 such that @xmath15 hence , @xmath16      let @xmath17 denote a forest and @xmath3 denote a tree .",
    "the operation of raising the forest @xmath12 by the tree @xmath3 noted @xmath18 consists in substituting every tree @xmath19 in the forest @xmath12 with an extended tree @xmath20 constructed by rooting the tree @xmath19 at every leaf of @xmath3 as illustrated in fig[5 ] .",
    "+    we note that the raising operator is not commutative .",
    "it also follows from the definition that for any tree @xmath3 we have @xmath21 finally , for convenience we adopt the convention that @xmath22      we recall that a label assignment to vertices of a tree is considered valid if the root is unlabeled and no two sibling vertices of the tree are assigned the same label .",
    "we assume here that the label set is of size @xmath24 , and furthermore , if we restrict our attention to the trees of height bounded by a positive integer @xmath23 , it is clear that the set of such trees is finite .",
    "+ we now describe a construction which produces the set of trees described above as a forest . for this purpose",
    "we consider the following recursion .",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 that is , @xmath27 where @xmath19 denotes the tree made of the root and an additional vertex who is assigned the @xmath28 label from our labeling set @xmath29 .",
    "+ for illustration purposes we express @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 by construction we have that for @xmath33 the trees in the forest @xmath34 are distinct , validly labeled and of depth bounded above by @xmath35 .",
    "furthermore @xmath36 it also follows from the definition of the recurrence that @xmath37 has @xmath38 elements and that the number of trees in the forest @xmath34 is prescribed by the recurrence relation @xmath39    * theorem 1 : * the forest @xmath40 contains all trees with valid vertex label assignment and of height bounded by @xmath23 .",
    "+ * proof :* the theorem is proved by first observing that the validly labeled trees of height bounded by @xmath23 correspond to rooted subtrees of the complete @xmath24-ary tree of height @xmath23 . a simple counting argument reveals that the number of such trees is determined by the recurrence relation @xmath41 and @xmath42 where @xmath43 denote the number of distinct rooted subtrees of the complete @xmath24-ary trees with height bounded by @xmath35 .",
    "we therefore conclude the proof by observing that @xmath44",
    "we discuss here the structural bijection between the set of integers and the set of valid prime  labeled trees .",
    "the mapping of an arbitrary valid tree ( labeled with primes ) to an integer , is established by equating the sibling relationship between vertices to integer multiplication and also equating for non - root vertices the parenthood relation to integer exponentiation .",
    "the process is therefore algorithmic and will be referred to as evaluation of a tree to an integer .",
    "we may point out that the evaluation process is recursive and insist that the evaluation be always initiated at the leaves because of the non - associativity of integer exponentiation .",
    "+ on the other hand the mapping of an arbitrary integer to a valid prime ",
    "labeled tree immediately follows from recursively applying the fundamental theorem of arithmetics to the powers of the prime factors . the single vertex tree ( only having the root as a vertex ) is associated to the integer @xmath45 .",
    "it therefore follows that the mapping between trees and integers is bijective .",
    "modern sieve theory focuses on providing accurate estimates for the number of primes in some integer interval .",
    "in contrast , as an application of the combinatorial framework described above we discuss a variation of the classical sieve of eratosthenes .",
    "we recall some notation convention .",

    "the first of which is that in the range @xmath64 there is no composite whose corresponding tree has a vertex labeled with a prime greater than @xmath68 .",
    "the reason being that @xmath69 is the largest of the composite less than or equal to @xmath69 , in other words the smallest composite admiting a prime @xmath66 greater than @xmath68 as a vertex label in the associated tree would be of the form @xmath70 and consequently necessarily greater than @xmath69 .",
    "the second fact is that all the composites whose corresponding trees are labeled with primes less than or equal to @xmath68 are determined by the combinatorial algorithm described in section 1.2 .",
    "furthermore , the sought  after primes in the range @xmath64 will be uncovered by identifying trees in the resulting forest which evaluate to nearest composites whose difference equals @xmath71 .",
    "georg cantor was the first to establish the suprising fact that the set @xmath72 is countably infinite . in @xcite neil calkin and herbert",
    "wilf introduced a sequence which listed the elements of @xmath72 so as not to include duplicates in the sequence .",
    "we discuss here another sequence for listing the rationals so as not to include duplicates .",
    "our sequence follows from the integer combinatorial encoding described above .",
    "the proposed construction for listing elements of @xmath72 has the benefit of providing explicit control over the subset of the prime numbers used to express the rationals in the sequence .",
    "+ let @xmath73 denote the tree made of a root vertex and an additional vertex labeled with the @xmath28 prime ( see fig[6 ] ) , and let @xmath74 denote the tree made of a root vertex and an additional vertex labeled with the inverse of the @xmath28 prime ( see fig[7 ] ) .",
    "building on the recurrence for @xmath75 discussed in 1.2 we write the recurrence @xmath25 and @xmath76 we use the recurrence for @xmath75 to create a new @xmath77 recurrence defined by @xmath78 we also have @xmath79 the trees in the forest @xmath77 evaluate to distinct rational numbers in reduced form and the rooted trees in the forest @xmath77 all have depth less than or equal to @xmath35 .",
    "the trees which evaluate to non - integers have special vertices that are prime ",
