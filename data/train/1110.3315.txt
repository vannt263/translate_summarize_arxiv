    "`` the evolution of life is , obviously , a nonuniform process '' @xcite . for biological evolution , this means that new types of biological objects emerge abruptly with subsequent gradual evolution .",
    "this evolutionary process can be schematically depicted as a tree ( `` the tree of life '' @xcite ) , where branches , are , for example , different species .",
    "importantly , the growth of this tree is complicated by interaction and competition between species . in this work",
    "we discuss one of the simplest models of growing trees which can mimic this process .",
    "growing trees naturally represent a wide range of real - life processes and phenomena @xcite .",
    "the galton - watson branching process @xcite provides a simple example of a growing tree with non - interacting nodes and so uncorrelated branching . interacting branching processes",
    "are much more interesting and difficult for analysis @xcite . in this work we study evolving trees",
    "which evolution is influenced by interaction between some of existing nodes , for example , nodes of the previous generation .",
    "we assume that the growing tree is embedded in some metric space and assume that spatially close nodes of the previous generation suppress mutually their ability to born new nodes .",
    "in other words , overcrowding of nodes in the embedding space suppresses their `` fertility '' .",
    "this kind of interaction ( competition ) , leading to suppression of branching , emerges if there is no sufficient space , no niches for the new nodes and branches ( species ) .    due to the embedding space",
    ", we can introduce distance between two nodes other then the shortest path internode distance for this tree .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we consider a @xmath2-dimensional euclidean space , although the results do not depend qualitatively on @xmath2 .",
    "networks embedded in metric spaces and their evolution already attracted much attention @xcite . in this paper",
    "we are particularly interested in a transition ( actually , crossover ) between different regimes of the network growth , namely , explosive ( exponential ) evolution and gradual ( power - law ) one . here",
    "the evolution of the network is characterized by the variation of the number of its nodes ( which corresponds to biological diversity , for example ) .",
    "we find the position of this transition and express it in terms of a single model parameter .",
    "this transition coincides with crossover from a `` small word '' to `` large word '' network architectures @xcite , where small words show a logarithmic dependence of network diameters on their sizes ( total numbers of nodes ) and large words show a power - law dependence @xcite .    one should emphasize a principal difference from the previous studies of this crossover . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the crossover was controlled by a model parameter , while in the present study the small - world and large - world architectures are realized on different stages of the network evolution .",
    "in addition we find how the spatial distribution of nodes evolves .",
    "we also consider the evolving trees embedded in restricted areas of metric spaces , and investigate the possibility of complete extinction .",
    "the term extinction for these trees implies the end of evolution and the absence of new generations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present the model of an evolving tree with interacting nodes and obtain simple estimates for its growth . in sec .",
    "iii we describe the network size evolution for two particular models of these trees . in sec .",
    "iv we consider the trees embedded in a bounded space and extinction . in sec .",
    "v we describe the evolution of the node spatial distribution . finally , in sec .",
    "vi , we summarize our results .",
    "the model , which we use , is formulated as follows ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] showing schematically the grows of the tree embedded in a two - dimensional space ) .",
    "the growth of the tree starts from a root node . at each time step , each of the nodes of the tree attempts to emit two leaves ( leaf is a link with a new node ) , so at each time step a new generation of nodes is born .",
    "the network is embedded in a @xmath2-dimensional euclidean space , and the root has zero coordinates . at each time step , make the following :    1 .",
    "choose uniformly at random a node @xmath3 ( coordinates @xmath4 ) from the previous generation and make an attempt to create its leaf with a new node at the point @xmath5 . here",
    "the random vector @xmath6 is uniformly distributed within @xmath7 , @xmath8 ,  .",
    "if among the nodes of the previous generation ( excluding the parent node @xmath3 ) and among the nodes already created at this time step , no nodes are closer than at distance @xmath0 from the point , @xmath5 , then create the leaf . if such nodes exist , abandon this attempt .",
    "make the next attempt to create the second leaf from this node using the same rules .",
    "2 .   from the rest nodes of the previous generation , choose uniformly at random nodes one by one and repeat ( 1 ) again and again until all the nodes of the previous generation will be updated .",
    "we will also consider a variation of this model , in which for each attempted node birth , closeness to all existing nodes should be checked and not only to the previous generation nodes .",
    "importantly , in both these models , existing nodes and links never disappear .",
    "figure  [ example ] shows the result of simulation of this model for @xmath9 and sufficiently small @xmath0 , namely , the evolution of the number of nodes @xmath10 of generation @xmath11 which plays the role of time .",
    "initially , @xmath12 grows exponentially , @xmath13 .",
    "one can see that after certain crossover time @xmath14 , the network growth is slower than exponential . for an arbitrary dimension @xmath2 , one can easily estimate @xmath15 at large @xmath11 . to obtain this estimate",
    ", we assume that nodes of generation @xmath11 are within a hypersphere which radius grows with a constant rate of the order of @xmath16 ( the rate is actually smaller than @xmath16 ) .",
    "this average rate of expansion is explained by the fact that children in this tree are born within unit distance from their parent nodes . since the neighboring nodes can not be closer than at distance @xmath0",
    ", we obtain @xmath17 .",
    "note that if the parameter @xmath0 is sufficiently large , @xmath12 does not grow at all .",

    "the only difference is that now @xmath28 in that estimate is the total number of nodes in the network , and so for the number of nodes of generation @xmath11 , we have @xmath29 , and , in particular , @xmath30 at @xmath9 . the results of simulations for this model , which give @xmath31 , see fig .",
