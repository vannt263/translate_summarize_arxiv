    "the second part is a stochastic algorithm grounded in basic principles of how genomes evolve , through translocation events and mutations , that qualitatively reproduces the behavior in the tail .",
    "our theory provides an estimator for the length of the shortest maws that is remarkably simple and captures well the global trend observed in large numbers of genomes from all sorts of organisms and viruses .",
    "considerations about the longest maw in a genome reveal sets of organisms sharing common high - level features such as the type of environment they live in .",
    "we have shown arguments for believing that organisms and viruses having few tail maws do so because of a low replication fidelity .",
    "why some organisms such as _ e. coli _ have long tail maws is less clear and replication fidelity alone does not seem to be a sufficient reason .    finally , we have introduced the concept of maw cores , sequences present on the genome that tell us about what causes the existence of their parent maw .",
    "we have shown that , while cores from bulk maws do not seem biologically relevant , cores from tail maws cluster in regions of the genome with special roles , namely ribosomal rnas and untranslated regions surrounding coding regions of genes , a feature that can not be explained by a stochastic protocol that ignores the biological roles of the strings it manipulates .",

    "<S> this indicates that maws and associated maw cores correspond to fine - tuned evolutionary relationships , and suggest that they can be more widely used as markers for genomic complexity .    </S>",
    "<S> enomic sequences are texts in languages shaped by evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest statistical properties of these languages are short - range dependencies , ranging from single - nucleotide frequencies ( gc content ) to @xmath0-step markov models , both of which are central to gene prediction and many other bioinformatic tasks  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more complex characteristics , such as abundances of @xmath0-mers , sub - sequences of length @xmath0 , have applications to classification of genomic sequences  @xcite , and _ e.g. _ to fast computations of species abundancies in metagenomic data  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> .    the reverse image of words present are absent words ( aws ) , subsequences which actually can not be found in a text . in genomics </S>",
    "<S> the concept was first introduced around 15 years ago for fragment assembly  @xcite and for species identification  @xcite , and later developed for inter- and intra - species comparisons  @xcite as well as for phylogeny construction  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a practical application is to the design of molecular bar codes such as in the tagrna - seq protocol recently introduced by us to distinguish primary and processed transcripts in bacteria  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> short sequences or tags are ligated to transcript @xmath1 ends , and reads from processed and primary transcripts can be distinguished _ in silico _ </S>",
    "<S> after sequencing based on the tags . for this to be possible </S>",
    "<S> it is crucial that the tags do not match any subsequence of the genome under study , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ that they correspond to absent words . in a further recent study </S>",
    "<S> we also showed that the same method allows to separate true antisense transcripts from sequencing artifacts giving a high - fidelity high - throughput antisense transcript discovery protocol  @xcite . in these as in other biotechnological applications there is an interest in finding short absent words , preferably additionally with some tolerance .    </S>",
    "<S> minimal absent words ( maw ) are absent words which can not be found by concatenating a substring to another absent word . </S>",
    "<S> all the subsequences of a maw are present in the text . </S>",
    "<S> maws in genomic sequences have been addressed repeatedly  @xcite as these obviously form a basis for the derived set of all absent words . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , while the number of absent words grows exponentially with their length  @xcite , because new aws can be built by adding letters to other aws , the number of maws for genomes shows a drastically different behavior , as illustrated below in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : absentwordsplot](a ) and previously reported in the literature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior can be summarized as there being one or more shortest minimal absent word of a length which we will denote @xmath2 , a maximum of the distribution at a length we will denote @xmath3 , and a very slow decay of the distribution for large @xmath4 . in human @xmath2 is equal to @xmath5 , as first found in  @xcite , @xmath3 is equal to @xmath6 , there being about @xmath7 billion maws of that length , while the support of the distribution extends to around @xmath8 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : absentwordsplot](c ) and ( d ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the total number of human maws is about eight billion . as already found in  @xcite the very end of the distribution </S>",
    "<S> depends on the genome assembly ; for human genome assembly grch38.p2 the three longest maws are @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 nt in length .     </S>",
    "<S> ( a )     ( b )     ( c )     ( d )    several aspects of this distribution are interesting . </S>",
    "<S> first , in a four - letter alphabet there are @xmath12 possible subsequences of length @xmath0 , but in a text of length @xmath13 only @xmath14 subsequences of length @xmath0 actually appear . if the human genome were a completely random string of letters one would therefore expect the shortest maw to be of length @xmath15 </S>",
    "<S> the fact that @xmath2 is considerably shorter ( @xmath5 ) is therefore already an indication of a systematic bias , in  @xcite attributed to the hypermutability of cpg sites . </S>",
    "<S> we will return to this point below . </S>",
    "<S> more intriguing is the observation that the overwhelming majority of the maws lie in a smooth distribution around @xmath3 , and then a small minority are found at longer lengths . </S>",
    "<S> we will call the first part of the distribution the _ bulk _ and the second the _ tail_. we separate the tail from the bulk by a cut - off @xmath16 which we describe below ; the human @xmath16 is @xmath17 , a typical number for larger genomes , while the _ escherichia coli _ @xmath16 is @xmath18 . using this separation there are about @xmath19 million human tail maws , about @xmath20 of the total , while there are @xmath21 _ e. coli _ tail maws , about @xmath22 of the total . </S>",
    "<S> the effect is qualitatively the same for , as far as we are aware of , all eukaryotic , archeal and baterial genomes analyzed in the literature  @xcite , as well as all tested by us . </S>",
    "<S> only a few viruses with short genomes are exceptions to this rule and show only the bulk , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : absentwordsplot](c ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the questions we want to answer in this work are why the distributions of maws are described by the bulk and the tail . </S>",
    "<S> can these be understood quantitatively ? </S>",
    "<S> do they carry biological information or are they some kind of sampling effects ? </S>",
    "<S> can one make further observations ? </S>",
    "<S> we will show that both the bulk and the tail can be described probabilistically , but in two very different ways . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk of the maw distribution arises from sampling words from finite random sequences and are contained in an interval @xmath23 $ ] , where @xmath16 was introduced above and @xmath24 is a good predictor of @xmath25 , the actual length of the shortest aws . to the best of our knowledge this has not been shown previously , and although our analysis uses only elementary considerations , they have to be combined in a somewhat intricate manner . the distribution of bulk maws , which comprise the vast majority of maws in all genomic sequences , can hence be seen as nothing more than a complicated transformation of simple statistical properties of the sequence . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , excellent results are obtained taking only the single nucleotide composition into account ( fig  [ fig : absentwordsplot](b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the tail maws are different , and can be described by a statistical model of genome growth by a copy  paste  mutate mechanism similar to the one presented in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the distributions of the tail maws vary , both in the data and in the model . </S>",
    "<S> the human and the mouse maw tail distributions follow approximately a power - law , but this seems to be more the exception than the rule ; bacteria and yeast as well as _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ _ picea abies _ </S>",
    "<S> ( norway spruce ) show a cross - over behavior to a largest maw length . for bacteria </S>",
    "<S> this largest length ranges from hundreds to thousands ; for _ p. abies _ it is around 30 000 ; while for human and mouse the tail maw distribution reaches up to one million , without cross - over behavior ( fig  [ fig : absentwordsplot](d ) ) .    from the definition , </S>",
    "<S> any subword obtained by removing letters from the start or end of a maw is present in the sequence . in particular , removing the first and last letters of a maw leads to a subword that is present at least twice , which we denote here as a _ maw core_. maws made of a repeat of the same letter are an exception to this rule as they can have the two copies of their cores overlapping each other , see appendix a in _ </S>",
    "<S> supplemental information_. maw cores can be considered as the causes that create the maws and their location on the genome combined with functional information from the annotation tells us about their biological significance . finding all the occurrences on a genome of a given word ( such as a maw core ) is the very common bioinformatic task of alignment , which can be done quickly and efficiently using one of the many software packages available . in bacteria and yeast , </S>",
    "<S> the cores from the longest maws are predominantly found in regions coding for ribosomal rnas ( rrnas ) , regions present in multiple copies on the genome and under high evolutionary pressure as their sequence determines their enzymatic properties , required for protein synthesis and vital to every living cell . at the global scale </S>",
    "<S> , it appears that maw cores obtained from maws in the bulk are distributed roughly uniformly over the genome while those from the tail cluster in @xmath26 utrs and , to a lesser extent , also in @xmath1 utrs . </S>",
    "<S> these regions are important for post - transcriptional regulation , and thus likely to be under evolutionary pressure similarly to rrnas .    </S>",
    "<S> we end this introduction by noting that from a linguistic perspective a language can be described by its list of _ forbidden _ sub - sequences , or the list of its forbidden words  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> minimal forbidden words relate to forbidden words as maws to absent words , and in a text of infinite length the lists of maws and minimal forbidden words would agree . </S>",
    "<S> if there is a finite list of minimal forbidden words the resulting language lies on the lowest level of regular languages in the chomsky hierarchy@xcite , and is hence relatively simple , while a complex set of instructions , such as a genome , is expected to correspond to a more complex language , with many layers of meaning . </S>",
    "<S> such aspects have been exploited in cellular automata theory  @xcite and in dynamical systems theory  @xcite , and are perhaps relevant to genomics as well . </S>",
    "<S> the present investigation is however focused on properties of texts of finite length , for which minimal forbidden words and maws are quite different . </S>"
