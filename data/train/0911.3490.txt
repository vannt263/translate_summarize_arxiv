    "intense theoretical effort is currently devoted to the understanding of the casimir effect for real experimental setups .",
    "this involves the impact of temperature , finite conductivity , engineered materials , and may identify routes to _ design _ the final casimir pressure .",
    "almost all analyses rely on the lifshitz formula @xcite where the physical properties of the material are encoded in the scattering amplitudes ( i.e. , reflection coefficients in planar geometries ) .",
    "their evaluation at imaginary frequencies obscures , however , how the material objects modify the modes of the electromagnetic field .",
    "a ` sum over modes ' approach is nevertheless possible , even if the eigenfrequencies @xmath0 are complex ( due to material absorption , for example ) . for two objects at distance @xmath1",
    "the casimir energy at zero temperature can be written as @xcite @xmath2^{l}_{\\infty } , \\qquad { \\mathrm{im}\\left.\\big[\\sideset{}{'}\\sum_{p,\\mathbf{k},m } \\omega_{m}\\big]_{\\infty}^{l}\\right.}=0\\ ] ] where the prime indicates that purely imaginary eigenfrequencies are weighted with @xmath3 .",
    "eq.([eq : casimir - diss ] ) generalizes casimir s formula for the vacuum energy between two perfect reflectors @xcite and is valid for generic ( causal ) mirrors with arbitrary thickness .",
    "note that one does not simply take real parts of the complex eigenfrequencies , as suggested some time ago@xcite ( see also ref . ) .",
    "the logarithmic correction in eq.([eq : casimir - diss ] ) is consistent with the ` system+bath ' paradigm that describes the thermodynamics of quantum dissipative systems@xcite . in this context , the frequency scale @xmath4 is interpreted as the cutoff frequency of the bath spectral density .",
    "the casimir energy does not depend on this constant because of the sum rule in .",
    "the sum - over - modes approach provides an ` anatomic view ' of the casimir effect where contributions from different modes are clearly identified .",
    "this is useful to understand unusual behaviours and may suggest new ways to taylor the casimir force@xcite . in the following ,",
    "we illustrate eq . with the help of a few examples .",
    "one of the most interesting contributions to the casimir force originates from surface modes bound to the vacuum / medium interface@xcite .",
    "these modes have a dispersion relation that splits in two branches , @xmath5 , as two surfaces are approached . substituting these frequencies in eq .",
    ", we get a plasmonic contribution to the casimir energy ( @xmath6 : surface area ) @xmath7^{l}_{\\infty } \\label{smalldiss1}\\ ] ] consider the case of two metals at a distance smaller than the plasma wavelength @xmath8 .",
    "we are then in the quasi - electrostatic regime , and the surface plasmon modes are given by@xcite ( red and blue points in fig.[branchcut ] ) @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the damping rate in a drude description of the metal .",
    "( not to scale ) .",
    "red and blue points : dissipative surface plasmons .",
    "red line : bulk continuum of eddy currents .",
    "black crosses : propagating modes in the cavity between the plates .",
    "( right ) a counter - clockwise path around the eddy current continuum is equivalent to a clockwise path around the whole complex plane , encircling all other modes . ]    [ branchcut ]    one can easily check that the sum rule in eq . is automatically satisfied . to leading order in @xmath11 ( good conductors ) eq .",
    "yields @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a zeta function .",
    "this corresponds exactly to the total casimir force calculated in ref .",
    ", including the dissipative correction .",
    "in fact , in this short distance limit , the casimir energy is completely dominated by the plasmonic contribution@xcite .",
    "is valid also beyond the good conductor limit , however , and could be used , e.g. , to analyze semiconductors where surface plasmons appear in a different frequency range and can have much stronger damping .",
    "as a second example , consider the contribution from eddy current modes . they are connected with low - frequency currents that satisfy a diffusion equation in the conducting metal@xcite and are completely absent within the lossless description of the so - called plasma model@xcite .",
    "we have analyzed these modes recently@xcite and constructed from the ` system+bath ' paradigm their quantum thermodynamics .",
    "they behave like free brownian particles , since the eigenfrequencies of bulk eddy currents are purely imaginary @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) . from eq . , we get the casimir energy @xmath16^{l}_{\\infty}\\ ] ] for these modes alone , the sum rule [ eq . ] is not satisfied , and the eddy current contribution to the casimir energy depends on the cutoff @xmath4 .",
    "this is also well - known from quantum brownian motion where bath modes up to @xmath4 are entangled to the particle .",
    "mathematically , eddy currents form a mode continuum that can be identified in the complex frequency plane from the branch cut of the root @xmath17 which describes the propagation of the electromagnetic field inside the medium . for a drude metal",
    ", the cut is located between @xmath18 ( for @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 ( see fig . [ branchcut ] ) , where @xmath21 is the electromagnetic diffusion constant .",
    "we get the @xmath1-dependent change in the mode density along the branch cut by applying the logarithmic argument theorem to the green function of the electromagnetic field . using the contour sketched in fig.[branchcut](left )",

    "is thus the result of the logarithmic argument theorem applied to the high - temperature limit of the free energy . now",
    "the contour around the eddy current continuum can also be interpreted as a contour encircling the whole complex plane , i.e. , the surface plasmon and propagating modes [ fig .",
    "[ changepath](right ) ] .",
    "this is particularly interesting in the te - polarization because there are no surface plasmons , and the residue at @xmath29 vanishes [ @xmath30 .",
    "this means that eddy currents and propagating modes give , up to a sign , the same casimir energy at high temperature ( or large distance ) .",
    "since propagating modes are only slightly affected by conduction on the metal ( i.e. , they behave similarly in the drude and plasma models ) , we find the simple relation @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the casimir free energy at high temperature calculated within the plasma model@xcite . in the drude model ,",
    "the two contributions are present and cancel each other when they are both in the high - temperature regime ( which happens at different distances , see fig.4 of ref . ) .",
    "a different scenario occurs in the tm - polarization .",
    "the residue at @xmath29 does not vanish and corresponds exactly to the high - temperature limit of the plasma model.@xcite indeed , we have checked that eddy currents give only a very small contribution .",
    "using a mode - summation approach , we have isolated and analyzed the contribution of two classes of modes to the casimir effect , allowing for complex eigenfrequencies of the electromagnetic field . a previous result for",
    "the short - distance limit between good conductors@xcite has been generalized to any conductivity and distance by considering coupled surface plasmonic modes ( for the lossless case , see refs . ) .",
    "we also considered eddy currents which are overdamped or diffusive modes in the bulk of a drude metal , and showed that they contribute a repulsive casimir interaction , in agreement with ref .. at high temperature and for a good conductor , we found in a simple way that their free energy in the te - polarization differs only slightly from the casimir free energy within a dissipationless description ( the plasma model ) , but is of the opposite sign . in this way",
    ", eddy currents nearly cancel out the attractive casimir interaction from propagating modes .",
    "this explains the strong difference between the drude and plasma models for the temperature correction of the electromagnetic casimir effect@xcite .",
