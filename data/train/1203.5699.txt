    "quantum chromodymanics in external magnetic field is an area that presents enormous interest for physicists .",
    "strong magnetic fields could be associated with formation of the early universe .",
    "it is assumed that magnetic fields @xmath6 gev existed in the universe during the electroweak phase transition  @xcite .",
    "it is known that cosmic space objects called magnetars or neutron stars possess magnetic field in their cores equal to @xmath7 .",
    "recently there was a number of amazing effects experimentally discovered and theoretically approved .",
    "for instance , star collaboration detected chiral magnetic effect during non - central collisions of gold ions based on data provided by the rhic @xcite . later this effect was also observed in alice experiment at the lhc .",
    "the values of magnetic fields in non - central heavy - ion collisions can reach up to @xmath8  @xcite , energy of hadronic scale .",
    "this magnetic field is caused by motion of ions , and it creates charge asymmetry of particles emitted from different sides of the reaction plane .",
    "such strong magnetic field can be created in terrestrial laboratories , which makes it possible to explore quark - hadronic matter under extreme conditions .",
    "strong enough magnetic fields lead also to modifications of the qcd phase diagram .",
    "phenomenological models show that the critical temperature of transition between phases of confinement and deconfinement varies with the increase of external magnetic field , and the phase transition becomes the one of the first order  @xcite .",
    "the increase of @xmath9 is also predicted in nambu - jona - lasinio models : njl , epnjl , pnjl @xcite and pnjl@xmath10 @xcite , gross - neveu model @xcite .",
    "the first prediction of lattice simulations with two flavours in qcd regarding behavior of the deconfinement temperature and the chiral symmetry restoration in increasing magnetic field was made in @xcite .",
    "however lattice simulations with @xmath11 @xcite revealed that @xmath9 decreases under increasing field value . as a matter of fact",
    ", the chiral perturbation theory predicts the decrease of the transition temperature under increasing magnetic field value as well  @xcite .",
    "these effects were studied in the past but only for the case of a chromomagnetic ( not usual abelian magnetic ) field @xcite .",
    "external magnetic fields lead to the enhancement of the chiral symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "the analytical calculations  @xcite predict a linear increase of the chiral condensate under increasing magnetic field in the leading order .",
    "lattice simulations show that chiral condensate depends on the strength of applied field as exponent function with @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "ads / cft approach shows the quadratic behaviour  @xcite .    in the framework of the nambu - jona - lasinio model",
    "it was shown that qcd vacuum becomes a superconductor @xcite along the direction of the magnetic field in the presence of sufficiently strong magnetic fields ( @xmath13 tl ) .",
    "this transition to superconducting phase is accompanied by condensation of charged @xmath1 mesons .",
    "calculations on the lattice  @xcite indicate existence of the superconducting phase as well .",
    "we have investigated the behavior of masses of neutral @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons with spin projection @xmath14 to the axis of the magnetic field . in qcd condensation of neutral @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons in external magnetic field",
    "would become an evidence of the superfluid phase existence .",
    "in @xcite they calculated the mass of neutral vector @xmath1 meson according to the relativistic quark - antiquark model and found out that in the phase of confinement the mass of this neutral @xmath1 meson with zero spin increases under raising magnetic field which contradicts the results presented in @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized in the following way . in section  [ setup ]",
    "we describe technical and numerical specifications of our simulations . in section  [ observables ]",
    "we discuss measured observables .",
    "section  [ methods ] is devoted to the methods of calculations .",
    "the results of our calculations are presented in sections  [ results1 ] and  [ results2 ] .",
    "to generate @xmath0 gauge field configurations we use the tadpole improved symanzik action @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the plaquette ( denoted by @xmath17 ) or 1@xmath182 rectangular loop term ( @xmath19 ) , @xmath20 is the input tadpole factor computed at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "this action suppresses ultraviolet dislocations , leading to non - physical near - zero modes of the wilson - dirac operator .",
    "we calculated fermionic spectrum in the presence of @xmath0 gauge fields using the chiral - invariant overlap operator proposed by neuberger  @xcite .",
    "this operator allows to explore the theory without chiral symmetry breaking and can be written as follows : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the wilson - dirac operator with the negative mass term @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the lattice spacing in physical units , @xmath25 is the wilson hopping term with @xmath26 .",
    "fermionic fields comply with periodic boundary conditions imposed on space and anti - periodic boundary conditions imposed on time .",
    "the sign function is calculated by the minmax polynomial approximation @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the hermitian wilson - dirac operator .",
    "to compute the sign function we use the 50 lowest wilson - dirac eigenmodes .",
    "the dirac operator in continuous space is @xmath29 and the corresponding dirac equation looks as follows : @xmath30 the neuberger overlap operator allows to calculate eigenfunctions @xmath31 and eigenvalues @xmath32 for the test quark in external gauge field @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath33 is the sum of @xmath0 gauge field and the external abelian uniform magnetic field .",
    "the eigenmodes of the dirac operator make it possible to construct operators and correlators presented in section 3 .",
    "abelian gauge fields interact only with quarks . to include abelian magnetic field in the simulations we perform the following substitution : @xmath34    @xmath35    to match this exchange with lattice boundary conditions the twisted boundary conditions for fermions have been used @xcite .    magnetic field in our calculations",
    "is directed along the third axes , its value is quantized @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the electric charge of the @xmath38-quark .",
    "there is one type of fermions in the theory .",
    "the quantization condition imposes a limit on the minimal value of the magnetic field .",
    "it equals to @xmath39 for the lattice volume @xmath40 and lattice spacing @xmath41 .",
    "we are far from the saturation regime in magnetic field when @xmath42 is not small because we use the values of @xmath43 in the interval @xmath44 for @xmath40 lattice volume and @xmath45 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 lattice volumes . for inversion of the mentioned operator we use the gaussian source ( with the radius @xmath48 in lattice units in both spatial and time directions ) and the point sink ( a quark position smeared over the gaussian profile ) .",
    "our calculations were performed on symmetric lattices with the lattice volumes @xmath46 , @xmath49 , @xmath40 and lattice spacings @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "we use statistically independent configurations of the gluon field for each value of the quark mass in the interval @xmath52 . for quark masses larger than @xmath53 the inversion works well .",
    "the following observables were calculated @xmath54 where @xmath55 are dirac gamma matrices , @xmath56 are lorentz indices . in the euclidean space @xmath57  @xcite . in presence of gauge field being the sum of gluonic fields and abelian constant magnetic field these current - current correlators in a meson channel can be expressed via dirac propagators .    in the continuous field theory ( [ observables ] ) can be written as follows : @xmath58 } \\left [ { { \\rm tr } \\ , } \\left(\\frac{1}{d+m } o_1 \\right ) { { \\rm tr } \\ , } \\left ( \\frac{1}{d+m } o_2 \\right)\\right]- \\label{observables : cont}\\ ] ] @xmath59 \\left [ { { \\rm tr } \\ , } \\left ( \\frac{1}{d+m } o_1 \\frac{1}{d+m } o_2 \\right )    \\right].\\ ] ] the first term in the numerator of ( ( [ observables : cont ] ) ) is the disconnected part , while the second one is connected .",
    "we checked that the disconnected part makes rather little relative contribution to correlators in comparison with the connected part in our model .",
    "also this disconnected part does not effect the values of meson masses .",
    "therefore we calculate only the connected parts of correlators  ( [ observables : cont ] )",
    ".    correlators ( [ observables : cont ] ) are defined by dirac propagators . to calculate these correlators we should first determine the inverse matrix for the massive dirac operator . for the m lowest eigenstates of the dirac operator this matrix",
    "is represented by the sum : @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "observables ( [ observables ] ) have the following form @xmath62 @xmath63    the first term in ( [ observables : cont ] ) is not essential as we mentioned above .",
    "magnetic and gluonic fields are considered in the way described above .",
    "the mass of neutral @xmath1 meson was extracted from the correlator of vector currents @xmath64 , where @xmath65 .",
    "we calculated the mass that has magnetic fieldwise projection of its spin equal to zero and it corresponds to @xmath66 in the expression ( [ lattice : correlator ] ) .",
    "the mass of a neutral @xmath2 meson can be found from the correlator of axial currents @xmath67 , where @xmath68 .",
    "the correlator @xmath69 enables us to compute the mass of @xmath70 meson , where @xmath71 is the pseudoscalar current .",
    "to calculate masses we apply two methods . the first one is based on spectral expansion of the lattice correlation function @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 where @xmath2 is some constant value , @xmath75 is the energy of the lowest state . for a particle with average momentum equal to zero @xmath76",
    "this energy is equal to its mass @xmath77 .",
    "@xmath78 is the energy of the first excited state , @xmath24 is the lattice spacing , @xmath79 is the number of a lattice site in the line of time direction . from expansion ( [ sum2 ] )",
    "one can see that for large values @xmath79 the main contribution comes from the ground state energy .    due to periodic boundary conditions the contribution of the ground state into meson propagator has the form @xmath80 @xmath81 the value of the ground state mass can be obtained by fitting the function ( [ sum33 ] ) to the lattice correlator ( [ sum ] ) . to minimize errors we take various @xmath79 values from the interval @xmath82 .",
    "the second method we use is the maximal entropy method ( mem )  @xcite .",
    "euclidean correlator of the imaginary time @xmath83 corresponds to the spectral function @xmath84 as follows : @xmath85    in general case @xmath86 contains all the properties of mesons and hadrons having desired quantum numbers .",
    "we presume @xmath87 and do not consider any functions from it .",
    "the first peak in the spectral function corresponds to the energy of the ground state .",
    "the kernel in  ( [ integral ] ) can be expressed as follows : @xmath88}{\\sinh(\\omega/2 t ) } , \\label{kernel}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 is the temperature , @xmath90 is the euclidean time , @xmath91 is the frequency . to extract the spectral function",
    "we should perform an inversion of the equation ( [ integral ] ) .",
    "this problem on the lattice is ill - defined as the correlator @xmath92 can be calculated only numerically at discrete points @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 .",
    "the integral was approximated by the discrete sum at points @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 is usually @xmath99 .",
    "we cut the integral  ( [ integral ] ) off at some @xmath100 .",
    "nevertheless this inversion turns out to be impossible . yet the ideas of bayesian probability theory make it possible to overcome this problem .",
    "the most probable spectral function @xmath101 can be computed provided that we find the maximum of conditional probability @xmath102 $ ] , where @xmath103 is the data , @xmath104 is our hypothesis , @xmath105 is a real and positive parameter , @xmath106 is a default model .",
    "this procedure is equivalent to the maximization of free energy @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is shannon entropy , @xmath109 .",
    "\\label{entropy}\\ ] ] @xmath110 is the standard likelihood function",
    ". detailed explanation of how to make a corresponding discretization on the lattice is offered in @xcite .",
    "we take @xmath111 $ ] and average the data within this interval .",
    "this interval was chosen in such a way that the results may vary slightly ( by approximately @xmath112 ) .",
    "the kernel  ( [ kernel ] ) contains divergence at @xmath113 leading to the unstable behaviour of the procedure under small energies .",
    "the bryan s key idea was to redefine the kernel and the spectral function @xmath114 so that @xmath115 and apply the svd theorem to the modified discretized kernel @xmath116 , see  @xcite .",
    "we use this modified algorithm to determine the spectral function in the following form @xmath117    the column vectors @xmath118 are normalized @xmath119 @xmath120 are the coefficients and we consider @xmath121 .    therefore , to reconstruct spectral function @xmath101 we have to choose default model @xmath122 correctly .",
    "such a default model should describe high and low energy behaviours of the spectral function correctly . according to the analysis @xcite we choose the following form of the model : @xmath123 where @xmath124 for scalar and pseudoscalar channels , @xmath125 for vector and axial vector channels @xcite .",
    "we also try to apply other default models ( constant function , @xmath126 , vary the @xmath127 and @xmath128 ) , but the choice ( [ defaultmodel ] ) gives the best convergence for the mem .",
    "in this section we present the calculation of neutral @xmath1 meson mass in @xmath0 gluodynamics under zero magnetic field .",
    "we compare our results to the previous ones to make sure that our method works properly .",
    "we measure the correlator of pseudoscalar currents @xmath130 , where @xmath131 and calculate the mass of the lowest energy state of neutral @xmath70 meson for different quark masses , volumes and lattice spacings .",
    "fig.[fig : pion1 ] and [ fig : pion2 ] demonstrate the linear dependence of the squared @xmath70 meson mass versus the bare quark mass .",
    "the chiral perturbation theory predicts linear dependence of squared pion mass on the renormalized quark mass @xmath132 , and this dependence can be expressed as follows : @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the pion decay constant , @xmath135 is the chiral condensate .",
    "provided that the mass of quark tends to zero , the pions are massless .",
    "fig.[fig : pion1 ] and [ fig : pion2 ] show that mentioned functions are slightly shifted relative to the origin of the coordinates and that the shift of quark mass from zero corresponds to the renormalization of this quark mass on the lattice .",
    "we calculate the mass of neutral vector @xmath1 meson under zero magnetic field via the correlators of vector currents .",
    "the symmetry between the different spatial directions was taken into account which improved the statistics significantly ( thrice ) .",
    "the quark mass renormalization was not considered because its value is very small at zero field .",
    "the extrapolation of @xmath1 meson mass to the limit of infinite physical volume was performed for several values of quark mass and two lattice spacings @xmath51 and @xmath136 ( fig.[fig : rho1 ] and [ fig : rho2 ] ) .",
    "after all we extrapolated @xmath137 to the quark mass @xmath138 corresponding to the value of the @xmath70 meson mass equal to @xmath139 .",
    "we obtained @xmath140 for the lattice spacing @xmath141 and @xmath142 for @xmath143 in su(2 ) gluodynamics .",
    "cc    cc    on fig.[fig : pion ] the squared pion mass is depicted for @xmath47 lattice volume , various bare quark masses and different values of the magnetic field @xmath145 . the observed linear dependence is legitimate for the chiral perturbation theory .",
    "fig.[fig : piondep ] represents the @xmath70 meson mass versus the value of the squared magnetic field .",
    "the mass depends on the lattice volume not significantly . for the renormalized quark mass and magnetic fields less than @xmath146",
    "we have obtained linear dependence of the mass on the magnetic field value ; the slope of the graph of this function is negative , which agrees with results of a.smilga obtained in the chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the angle of the slope is obtuse and it differs from chpt because we explore the @xmath0 gauge theory without dynamical quarks .",
    "thus @xmath0 reveals qualitative properties of the theory correctly .",
    "if the direction of external magnetic field is parallel to the 3rd coordinate axis then meson masses having magnetic fieldwise projections of their spins equal to zero are calculated from the expression ( [ lattice : correlator ] ) with @xmath66 .",
    "the diagonal components of the correlators are not equal to zero while the nondiagonal ones equal to zero within the error bars .",
    "fig.[fig : rho33_mem ] shows the mass of neutral vector meson with zero spin calculated in accordance with the maximal entropy method for different lattice volumes , spacings and bare quark masses .",
    "we have not performed mass extrapolations and renormalizations though .",
    "we found that the mass decreases under raising magnetic field for all the sets of data .",
    "we use the ensemble of @xmath147 ) results of mem procedure and calculate average and standard deviations for the best set of mem parameters . to calculate errors we took the @xmath91-discretization into account as well .",
    "fig.[fig : axialmem ] shows behaviour of the neutral @xmath2 meson mass with zero spin depending on the external magnetic field .",
    "the mass decreases as well but under @xmath148 we observe the peak which might be a lattice artifact .",
    "the lattice artefacts are not significant yet we are restricted by the small lattice spacing which is not fine enough and can not explore the masses under strong magnetic fields .",
    "as we know the radius of the lowest landau level @xmath149 we may assume that lattice artefacts might appear under @xmath150 . therefore we make simple estimations and obtain the maximal value of magnetic field @xmath151 for the spacing @xmath41 , @xmath152 for the @xmath143 and @xmath153 for @xmath154 lattice spacing .",
    "cc    cc    cc    on fig.[fig : mrho_b2_extr_s0 ] , [ fig : mrho_b2_extr_s1 ] and [ fig : ma_b2_extr_s0 ] we present the masses with various spin projections that were received by fitting the coshinus function to correlators and further extrapolation of quark masses .",
    "the masses of the vector meson were calculated for various values of magnetic field .",
    "we calculated these masses for nonzero magnetic field taking the quark mass renormalization @xmath156 into account .",
    "on the basis of the mentioned calculation we can conclude that masses of vector mesons depend on that renormalization not significantly .",
    "afterwards we performed @xmath1 meson mass extrapolation on the mass of quark to its value under which the mass of @xmath70 meson is equal to @xmath139 .",
    "this procedure was done taking the renormalization of the quark mass into account .",
    "we calculate the mass of @xmath1 meson for several values of @xmath157 from the interval @xmath158 , perform fitting and find coefficients @xmath159 and @xmath160 in the equations @xmath161 @xmath162 then we extrapolate @xmath163 on physical values @xmath164 at @xmath165 using ( [ fit2 ] ) and ( [ fit3 ] ) .",
    "different components of the vector currents correlators were calculated , and it was found that diagonal components differ from zero essentially while nondiagonal ones are equal to zero within the error bars .",
    "correlators of the vector currents perpendicular to the magnetic field are @xmath166 and @xmath167 , where @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "the masses with spin @xmath5 are found from the relations @xmath170 and @xmath171 .    on fig.[fig : mrho_b2_extr_s0 ] one can see the dependence of the mass of the neutral vector @xmath1 meson with zero spin on the value of the field after the mass renormalization and extrapolation for the lattice volumes @xmath47 and @xmath40 and lattice spacings @xmath172 . for the purposes of visualization we connected the points by splines .",
    "the mass of vector meson decreases nonlinearly under raising magnetic field for all the lattices .",
    "we observe a weak dependence of masses from lattice volumes and spacings , but the qualitative behaviour for all the sets of data is the same .",
    "fig.[fig : mrho_b2_extr_s1 ] shows the dependence of the @xmath1 meson mass with nonzero spin on the field value .",
    "masses with spin @xmath173 increase under the raising field .",
    "these results were obtained after the quark mass extrapolation .",
    "on fig.[fig : ma_b2_extr_s0 ] we see the mass of the neutral axial meson with fieldwise spin projections @xmath174 .",
    "calculation of the axial meson mass requires much more statistics than the calculation of the vector meson mass especially in cases with nonzero spin components .",
    "one can observe that the mass of @xmath2 meson with zero spin decreases while the masses with @xmath5 increase slowly .",
    "unfortunately the quantum numbers of mesons on the lattice in the presence of magnetic field are not precise .",
    "the mixing takes place due to the interaction between photons and vector ( axial ) quark currents and can occur between neutral pion and neutral @xmath1 ( or @xmath2 ) meson with zero spin .",
    "now there are no rigorous methods to disentangle these two states in magnetic field , this is the topic for the further work .",
    "however , we have clear signs of the increase of the vector and axial mesons masses with @xmath5 in our @xmath0 theory .",
    "in this work we explore the behaviour of masses of the neutral pseudoscalar @xmath70 , vector @xmath1 and axial @xmath2 mesons in confinement phase in the presence of external magnetic field of hadronic scale .",
    "we observe that the masses with fieldwise spin projection equal to zero differ from the masses with spin projection @xmath5 .",
    "the masses with @xmath4 decrease with the growth of the magnetic field while the masses with @xmath5 increase in the same conditions .",
    "we consider this phenomena to be the result of the anisotropy created by the strong magnetic field .",
    "we do not observe any condensation of neutral mesons , so there are no evidences of superfluidity in the confinement phase .",
    "however , the presence of superconducting phase at high values of the magnetic field @xmath3  @xcite in qcd is a hot topic for discussions .",
    "condensation of charged @xmath1 mesons would be an evidence of the existence of superconductivity in qcd .",
