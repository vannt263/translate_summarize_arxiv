    "the capacity of the interference channel ( ic ) is a thirty years old problem in network information theory , that is of practical importance as well .",
    "when more than one transmitter and receiver want to communicate simultaneously , interference limits their communication .",
    "the rate region for the simplest case of two transmitters and two receivers has been thoroughly studied , but the problem remains open for the general case .",
    "recently , some good achievements have been made in characterizing the degrees of freedom and achievable rate regions of interference networks .",
    "it was shown in @xmath0 , that by using a simple han - kobayashi scheme @xmath1 , the capacity of a two user interference channel can be achieved to within one bit .",
    "for the general case of a @xmath2-user interference network , it was shown in @xmath3 that the degrees of freedom is given by @xmath4 , i.e. the capacity can be well characterized by @xmath5 where the second term decreases for increasing @xmath6 . from a practical point of view , it is always interesting to analyze the performance of suboptimal schemes .",
    "for instance , in @xmath7 , the rate region of a @xmath2-user interference channel is analyzed for the case in which the interference is treated as noise .",
    "the optimality of treating interference as noise for the two - user interference channel has been analyzed in @xmath8 .",
    "power allocation strategies for the same system have been analyzed in @xmath9 .",
    "game - theoretic aspects have been considered in @xmath10 .",
    "another direction in the study of the ic is the interference relay channel ( irc ) , where a relay is used to support the communication between transmitters and receivers .",
    "this has gained research interest since @xmath11 .",
    "recently , a communication scheme that achieves full degrees of freedom at high @xmath6 was proposed in @xmath12 for the interference channel with a mimo relay ( imrc ) . in this scheme ,",
    "the transmitters communicate with the relay in a mac phase , then the relay broadcasts the received data to the receivers .",
    "this is of practical interest , since in practice , the relay does not have knowledge of the transmit signals .    in this paper , we consider the imrc with the communication scheme proposed in @xmath12 .",
    "namely , this scheme uses superposition block markov encoding , beamforming , and willems backward decoding . in spite of its complexity",
    ", this scheme transforms the imrc to an ic , with channel gains dependent on the signal power , which simplifies the study of the imrc . in @xmath12 ,",
    "some power allocation strategies are considered , but these power allocations are not optimal ; they are of interest for high transmit power @xmath13 , where they were used to state the degrees of freedom of the system .",
    "we extend the study to the low @xmath13 case , where we study the performance of this scheme , and propose an ( approximately ) optimal power allocation .",
    "we give the model of the imrc in section [ model ] , and describe the communication scheme in section [ scheme ] .",
    "then we study its performance at low @xmath13 in section [ performance ] .",
    "a numerical example is included in section [ example ] .",
    "finally , we conclude with section [ conclusion ] .",
    "figure @xmath14 shows a model of the imrc .",
    "each transmitter needs to communicate with its respective receiver , and the relay tries to support this communication .",
    "we assume that the transmitters and receivers are equipped with one antenna each , and the relay is equipped with 2 antennas .",
    "we denote by @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 the transmitted signals of transmitter 1 , 2 and the relay respectively , and by @xmath18 and @xmath19 the received signals at receivers 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "we consider zero mean , unit variance , additive white gaussian noises at the receivers and the relay denoted as @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "so we can write the input - output relations as : @xmath23 where for @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 denotes the direct channel gain from transmitter @xmath27 to receiver @xmath27 , @xmath28 the cross channel gain from transmitter @xmath27 to receiver @xmath29 , @xmath30^t$ ] the channel gain from transmitter @xmath27 to the relay , and @xmath31^t$ ] the channel gain from the relay to receiver @xmath27 .",
    "the transmitters have a power constraint @xmath13 , and the relay has a power constraint @xmath32 .",
    "we assume that the relay operates in full duplex mode , and has global channel knowledge .",
    "the coding strategy considered is the one proposed in @xmath12 , and we will briefly explain it in this section .",
    "we consider transmission over a period of @xmath33 blocks , where the sources and the relay send sequences of @xmath34 messages .",
    "if a rate pair @xmath35 is achievable in a block , then this scheme achieves a rate pair @xmath36 , that approaches @xmath35 as @xmath37 .",
    "this coding strategy at the transmitters and the relay is sketched in table [ bmctable ] for the general case , and in the following , we explain it in more details .",
    "we use super - position block markov encoding at the sources @xmath11 , i.e. @xmath38 where for user @xmath27 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the codeword of the message of block @xmath41 , with power @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , is the codeword of the message of the previous block @xmath44 , with power @xmath45 , such that @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "the transmitters use predefined messages @xmath48 and @xmath49 as the messages of block @xmath50 , i.e. @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the relay uses the sdma scheme described in @xmath53{tsevis}$ ] .",
    "assuming that the decoding of messages @xmath54 and @xmath55 was successful , the relay can subtract them from the received signal , and then decode the messages @xmath56 and @xmath57 using successive interference cancellation , achieving rate constraints given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 $ ] , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is the @xmath62 identity matrix .",
    "after decoding , the relay uses multimode beamforming to transmit to the receivers , i.e. the relay constructs the signal @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are unitary @xmath66 beamforming vectors . in our approach , @xmath64 and @xmath65",
    "are chosen such that they reduce interference at the receivers .",
    "let @xmath67 $ ] be the power trade - off coefficients at the relay , i.e. the relay splits its power to @xmath68 and @xmath69 for @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively , such that @xmath72 .",
    "so @xmath73    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the received signal at receiver @xmath27 for block @xmath41 can be written as @xmath74 with @xmath25 , @xmath24 .",
    "in order to reduce interference , the relay chooses the beamforming vectors @xmath64 and @xmath65 such that @xmath75 let us denote by @xmath76 and @xmath77 the vectors @xmath78 and @xmath79 respectively .",
    "since @xmath64 and @xmath65 are unitary , it follows @xmath80 with @xmath81 and @xmath82 , we get a system of two equations with two unknowns for each of the beamforming vectors .",
    "notice that these equations do not have a unique solution .",
    "equation @xmath81 tells us that the components of @xmath83 are linear with respect to each other , while @xmath82 tells us that the beamforming vector lies on a circle , leading to two solutions .",
    "solving for @xmath76 and @xmath77 , we get for @xmath25 , @xmath24 , @xmath84,\\ ] ] where @xmath85 with @xmath86 .",
    "this gives unitary @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and satisfies @xmath81 .",
    "this choice of @xmath83 reduces interference seen by the receivers , so then we can express @xmath87 as @xmath88 now , the receivers can use willems backward decoding @xmath89 to decode their signals .",
    "starting from block @xmath33 , receivers 1 and 2 have interference free signals and can decode @xmath90 and @xmath91 respectively . then , in each block @xmath41 , the receivers subtract the already known signals @xmath56 and @xmath57 from their received signals before attempting to decode @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "now we can express @xmath87 as @xmath92 as a result , the interference relay channel transforms into an ic . to simplify the notation",
    ", we will use @xmath93 and @xmath94 to denote the new channel coefficients : @xmath95 now we can write the obtained ic input - output equations @xmath96 as @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 depend on the channel coefficients , @xmath42 , @xmath13 , @xmath32 and @xmath100 .",

    "this approximation is needed for solving our optimization problem , due to the fact that the argument of the square root in @xmath117 is not concave in @xmath42 , and hence can not be optimized using standard convex optimization tools ( e.g. @xmath118 ) .",
    "the receivers in the obtained ic treat interference as noise , resulting in rates bounded by @xmath119      up to this point , the expressions are not low-@xmath13-specific . from this point on ,",
