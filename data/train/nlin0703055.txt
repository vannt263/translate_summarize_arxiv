    "the spontaneous formation of clusters of particles suspended in chaotic flows may originate from two different physical processes : compressibility of the fluid flow and particle inertia . in the first case particles",
    "are trapped in regions of ongoing compression , while in the second case inertia causes their ejection from vortical regions .",
    "the underlying link between these two phenomena is manifested in the limit of weak inertia , in which particle dynamics in incompressible flows can be approximated by that of tracers in a weakly compressible velocity field  @xcite .",
    "clustering processes have been extensively studied , both in the case of compressible flows @xcite and inertial particles @xcite .",
    "fractal dimension of the clusters , obtained from the ratios of lyapunov exponents of particle trajectories , has revealed a powerful tool to quantify the intensity of the clustering @xcite , and has motivated further studies of lyapunov exponents of inertial particles @xcite .",
    "aggregation is an extreme form of clustering , which occurs when the trajectories of different particles tend to point - like clusters . in this situation",
    "the senior lyapunov exponent of particle trajectories become negative , signaling that nearby particles do not separate exponentially as expected in a chaotic flows , but their paths eventually coalesce .",
    "this phenomenon has been described for fluid tracers in compressible flows @xcite , as well as for light particles in incompressible flows @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , it has been shown that in compressible flows , where fluid trajectories coalesce , large enough inertia can induce a transition from the strong clustering regime into a week clustering one , where particle trajectories remains chaotic and the senior lyapunov exponent is positive @xcite . analytic results on this aggregation ",
    "disorder transition have been obtained under the assumption that the carrier flow is short - correlated in time .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask how time correlations of real turbulent flows can influence this phenomena . as pointed out by recent numerical studies of fluid tracers in compressible flows @xcite ,",
    "time correlations are responsible for an increase in the level of compressibility required for the transition to the strong - clustering regime . in the case of inertial particles in",
    "has been found @xcite that time correlations cause increase the ( positive ) lyapunov exponent ( i.e. make particle flow more chaotic ) already at weak inertia , which can not be predicted in the framework of short correlated flows @xcite .",
    "here we discuss a simple time - correlated model flow , recently introduced in  @xcite , which allows to get a deeper insight on the interplay between inertia and compressibility , and to investigate analytically the dependence on stokes and kubo numbers of lyapunov exponent of particle trajectories .",
    "the dynamics of two small inertial particle , whose density is much larger than the fluid density is dominated by the viscous drag .",
    "hence , the equation for their separation @xmath1 and relative velocity @xmath2 reads  @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the stokes time of the particles , and @xmath5 is the difference of fluid velocities at particle positions .    to investigate",
    "the behavior of lyapunov exponent one has to consider separations smaller than the viscous length - scale of the flow . at these scales",
    "the fluid velocity difference can be written in terms of the velocity gradients @xmath6 as @xmath7 .",
    "the lyapunov exponent @xmath8 is determined by the contributions of the local gradients @xmath9 experienced by the two nearby trajectories .",
    "note that the statistics of velocity gradients in the reference frame of an inertial particle differs from the eulerian statistics due to preferential concentration .",
    "let us now consider an idealized one - dimensional flow , in which the fluid velocity gradient in the reference frame of a particle is modelled by a _ telegraph noise _ @xmath10 , i.e. a noise that switches randomly between two fixed values @xmath11 .",
