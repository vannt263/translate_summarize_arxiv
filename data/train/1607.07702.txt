    "scientific computation has become critically enabling in almost every field of scientific and engineering study , enabling simulations with modern computers that were thought to be out of reach even a decade ago and suggesting the possibility of exascale computing architectures .",
    "the continued scaling of memory , processor speed and parallelization enable studies of increasingly sophisticated multi - scale physical systems . despite these advances , significant challenges and computational bottlenecks still remain in efficiently computing dynamics of extremely high - dimensional systems , such as high reynolds turbulent flow . reduced order models ( roms ) are of growing importance as a critically enabling mathematical framework for reducing the dimension of such large systems .",
    "the core of the rom architecture relies on two key innovations : ( i ) the pod - galerkin method  @xcite , which is used for projecting the high - dimensional nonlinear dynamics to a low - dimensional subspace in a principled way , and ( ii ) sparse sampling ( gappy pod ) of the state space for interpolating the nonlinear terms required for the subspace projection .",
    "the focus of this manuscript is on a sparse sampling innovation for roms .",
    "specifically , a method for optimizing sampling locations for both reconstruction and identification of parametrized systems .",
    "we propose an algorithm comprised of two components : ( i ) an _ offline _ stage that produces initial sparse sensor locations , and ( ii ) an _ online _ stage that uses a short , genetic search algorithm for producing nearly optimal sensor locations .",
    "the technique optimizes for both reconstruction error and classification efficacy , leading to an attractive _ online _ modification of commonly used gappy pod methods .",
    "the importance of sparse sampling of high - dimensional systems , especially those manifesting low - dimensional dynamics , was recognized early on in the roms community .",
    "thus sparse sampling has already been established as a critically enabling mathematical framework for model reduction through methods such as gappy pod and its variants  @xcite .",
    "more generally , sparsity promoting methods are of growing importance in physical modeling and scientific computing  @xcite .",
    "the seminal work of everson and sirovich  @xcite first established how the gappy pod could play a transformative role in the mathematical sciences . in their sparse sampling scheme",
    ", random measurements were used to perform reconstruction tasks of inner products .",
    "principled selection of the interpolation points , through the gappy pod infrastructure  @xcite or missing point ( best points ) estimation ( mpe )  @xcite , were quickly incorporated into roms to improve performance .",
    "more recently , the transformative empirical interpolation method ( eim )  @xcite and its most successful variant , the pod - tailored discrete empirical interpolation method ( deim )  @xcite , have provided a greedy , sparse samplimg algorithm that allows for nearly optimal reconstructions of nonlinear terms of the original high - dimensional system .",
    "the deim approach combines projection with interpolation .",
    "specifically , the deim uses selected interpolation indices to specify an interpolation - based projection for a nearly optimal @xmath0 subspace approximating the nonlinearity .",
    "it is well - known that the various sparse sampling techniques proposed are not optimal , but have been shown to be sufficiently robust to provide accurate reconstructions of the high - dimensional system .",
    "the deim algorithm has been particularly successful for nonlinear model reduction of time - dependent problems .",
    "interestingly , for parametrized systems , the deim algorithm needs to be executed in the various dynamical regimes considered , leading to a library learning mathematical framework  @xcite .",
    "thus efficient sparse sampling locations for both classification and reconstruction can be computed in an _ offline _ manner across various dynamical regimes .",
    "again , they are not optimal , but they are robust for building roms .",
    "we build upon the deim library learning framework  @xcite , showing that nearly - optimal sparse sampling can be achieved with a short _ online _ , genetic algorithm search from the learned deim libraries .",
    "this improves both the classification and reconstruction accuracy of the sparse sampling , making it an attractive performance enhancer for roms .",
    "the paper is outlined as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : rom ] , the basic rom architecture is outlined .",
    "section  3 reviews the various innovations of the sparse sampling architecture , including the library building procedure used here .",
    "section  4 develops the genetic search algorithm for _ online _ improvement of sparse sampling locations .",
    "the method advocated here is demonstrated in sec .  5 on two example problems : the complex cubic - quintic ginzburg - landau equation and fluid flow past a circular cylinder .",
    "concluding remarks are provided in sec .",
    "in our analysis , we consider a parametrized , high - dimensional system of nonlinear differential equations that arises , for example , from the finite - difference discretization of a partial differential equation . in the formulation",
    "proposed , the linear and nonlinear terms for the state vector @xmath1 are separated : @xmath2 where @xmath3^t\\in \\mathbb{r}^n$ ] and @xmath4 . typically , @xmath5 is the value of the field of interest discretized at the spatial location @xmath6 .",
    "the linear part of the dynamics is given by the linear operator @xmath7 and the nonlinear terms are in the vector @xmath8^t\\in \\mathbb{r}^n$ ] .",
    "the nonlinear function is evaluated component - wise at the @xmath9 spatial grid points used for discretization .",
    "note that we have assumed , without loss of generality , that the parametric dependence @xmath10 is in the nonlinear term .",
    "typical discretization schemes for achieving a prescribed spatial resolution and accuracy require the number of discretization points @xmath9 to be very large , resulting in a high - dimensional state vector . for sufficiently complicated problems where significant spatial refinement is required and/or higher spatial dimension problems ( 2d or 3d computations , for instance ) can potentially lead to a computationally intractable problem where roms are necessary .",
    "the pod - galerkin method  @xcite is a principled dimensionality - reduction scheme that approximates the function @xmath1 with rank-@xmath11-optimal basis functions where @xmath12 .",
    "these optimal basis functions are computed from a singular value decomposition of a time series of snapshots of the nonlinear dynamical system ( [ eq : complex ] ) .",
    "given the snapshots of the state variable @xmath13 at @xmath14 times , the snapshot matrix @xmath15    \\in \\mathbb{r}^{n\\times p}$ ] is constructed and the svd of @xmath16 is computed @xmath17 the @xmath11-dimensional basis for optimally approximating @xmath1 is given by the first @xmath11 columns of matrix @xmath18 , denoted by @xmath19 .",
    "the pod - galerkin approximation is then computed from the following decomposition @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the time - dependent coefficient vector and @xmath12 .",
    "note that such an expansion implicitly assumes a separation of variables between time and space . plugging this modal expansion into the governing equation ( [ eq : complex ] ) and applying orthogonality ( multiplying by @xmath22 )",
    "gives the dimensionally reduced evolution @xmath23 where it is noted that @xmath24 , the @xmath25 identity matrix .    by solving this system of much smaller dimension",
    ", the solution of a high - dimensional nonlinear dynamical system can be approximated with optimal ( in an @xmath0 sense ) basis functions .",
    "of critical importance is evaluating the nonlinear terms in an efficient way using the gappy pod or deim mathematical architecture .",
    "otherwise , the evaluation of the nonlinear terms still requires calculation of functions and inner products with the original dimension @xmath9 . in certain cases , such as for the quadratic nonlinearity in the navier - stokes equations ,",
    "the nonlinear terms can be computed once in an offline manner .",
    "however , parametrized systems generally require repeated evaluation of the nonlinear terms as the pod modes change with @xmath10 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : pod ] ) provides the starting point of the rom architecture .",
    "it also illustrates one of the two critical innovations of roms : a principled dimensionality reduction .",
    "in and of itself , the dimensionality reduction provided by the pod method does not ensure that the reduced model ( [ eq : pod ] ) remains low - dimensional .",
    "this is simply due to the evaluation of the nonlinear term @xmath26 . specifically , the nonlinearity forces the evaluation of the nonlinear function and inner products at every time step when advancing ( [ eq : pod ] ) with a time - stepping scheme .",
    "such inner products require computations that scale with @xmath9 , keeping the rom fixed in the higher dimensional space .",
    "in contrast , the linear term @xmath27 can be computed once , either at the beginning of the simulation , or in an offline stage .",
    "this product of matrices yields a matrix of size @xmath25 , thus requiring computations that scale with @xmath11 to update the linear portion of the evolution .    to avoid the costly computations associated with approximating @xmath28",
    ", we compute an approximation to the nonlinearity through projection and interpolation instead of evaluating it directly .",
    "a considerable reduction in complexity is achieved by the deim , for instance , because evaluating the approximate nonlinear term does not require a prolongation of the reduced state variables back to the original high dimensional state approximation required to evaluate the nonlinearity in the pod approximation .",
    "the deim therefore improves the efficiency of the pod approximation and achieves a complexity reduction of the nonlinear term with a complexity proportional to the number of reduced variables .",
    "the deim constructs these specially selected interpolation indices that specify an interpolation - based projection to provide a nearly @xmath0 optimal subspace approximation to the nonlinear term without the expense of orthogonal projection  @xcite .      to better understand how the computation of the nonlinearity through projection and interpolation",
    ", we consider taking @xmath29 measurements ( @xmath30 with @xmath31 ) of the full state vector @xmath32 .",
    "specifically , only @xmath33 measurements are required for reconstruction , allowing us to define the sparse representation variable @xmath34 @xmath35 where the measurement matrix @xmath36 specifies @xmath29 measurement locations of the full state @xmath37 . as an example",
    ", the measurement matrix might take the form @xmath38\\ ] ] where measurement locations take on the value of unity and the matrix elements are zero elsewhere .",
    "the matrix @xmath39 defines a projection onto an @xmath29-dimensional measurement space @xmath40 that is used to approximate @xmath32 .",
    "the sparse sampling of  ( [ eq : gap ] ) forms the basis of the _ gappy pod _ method introduced by everson and sirovich  @xcite . in their example of eigenface reconstruction , they used a small number of measurements , or gappy data , to reconstruct an entire face .",
    "this serves as the basis for approximating the nonlinear inner products in ( [ eq : pod ] ) and overcoming the computational complexity of the pod reduction .",
    "the measurement matrix @xmath39 allows for an approximation of the state vector @xmath32 from @xmath29 measurements .",
    "the approximation is given by substituting ( [ eq : podg ] ) into ( [ eq : gap ] ) : @xmath41 where the coefficients @xmath42 minimize the error in approximation @xmath43 the goal is to determine the @xmath42 despite the fact that taking inner products of ( [ eq : gapapprox ] ) can no longer be performed .",
    "specifically , the vector @xmath40 is of length @xmath29 whereas the pod modes are of length @xmath9 .",
    "implied in this sparse sampling is that the modes @xmath44 are in general not orthogonal over the @xmath29-dimensional support of @xmath40 , which is denoted as @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "specifially , the following two relationships hold    & & m_jk = ( _ j,_k ) = _ jk + & & m_jk = ( _ j,_k ) _ s [ ] 0 j , k [ eq : m ]    where @xmath46 are the entries of the hermitian matrix @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the kroenecker delta function .",
    "the fact that the pod modes are not orthogonal on the support @xmath45 $ ] leads us to consider alternatives for evaluating the vector @xmath49 .    as demonstrated by everson and sirovich  @xcite , the @xmath42",
    "is determined by a least - square fit error algorithm .",
    "specifically , we project the full state vector @xmath32 onto the support space and determine the vector @xmath49 with the equation : @xmath50 where the elements of the matrix @xmath47 are given by ( [ eq : m]b ) and the components of the vector @xmath51 are given by @xmath52 } $ ] .",
    "the pseudo - inverse for determining @xmath49 is a least - square fit algorithm .",
    "note that in the event the measurement space is sufficiently dense , or as the support space is the entire space , then @xmath53 and @xmath54 , thus implying the eigenvalues of @xmath47 approach unity as the number of measurements become dense .",
    "once the vector @xmath49 is determined , then a reconstruction of the solution can be performed using @xmath55 it only remains to consider the efficacy of the measurement matrix @xmath39 .",
    "originally , random measurements were proposed  @xcite .",
    "however , the roms community quickly developed principled techniques based upon , for example , minimization of the condition number of @xmath47  @xcite , selection of minima or maxima of pod modes  @xcite , and/or greedy algorithms of eim / deim  @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath29 measurement locations were judiciously chosen for the task of accurately interpolating the nonlinear terms in the rom .",
    "this type of sparsity has been commonly used throughout the roms community .",
    "the deim algorithm constructs two low - rank spaces through the svd : one for the full system using the snapshots matrix @xmath16 , and a second using the snapshot matrix composed of samples of the nonlinearity alone .",
    "thus a low - rank representation of the nonlinearity is given by @xmath56 = { \\bf \\xi \\sigma}_n { \\bf w}_n^*\\ ] ] where the matrix @xmath57 contains the optimal ( in an @xmath0 sense ) basis set for spanning the nonlinearity .",
    "specifically , we consider the rank-@xmath29 basis set @xmath58 $ ] that approximates the nonlinear function ( @xmath33 and @xmath59 ) .",
    "the approximation to the nonlinearity @xmath60 in this svd basis set is given by : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is similar to @xmath63 in ( [ eq : podg ] ) .",
    "since this is a highly overdetermined system , a suitable vector @xmath62 can be found by selecting only @xmath29 rows of the system .",
    "the deim algorithm provides a greedy search algorithm for selecting an appropriate @xmath29 rows .",
    "although not guaranteed to be optimal , in practice the row selection tends to provide sampling points that are accurate for reconstruction of the full state .",
    "the deim algorithm begins by considering the vectors @xmath64 which are the @xmath65-th column of the @xmath9 dimensional identity matrix",
    ". we can then construct the projection matrix @xmath66 $ ] which is chosen so that @xmath67 is nonsingular",

    "such sensors can be used with sparse representation and compressive sensing to ( i ) identify dynamical regimes , ( ii ) reconstruct the full state of the system , and ( iii ) provide an efficient nonlinear model reduction and pod - galerkin prediction for the future state . given the parametrized nature of the evolution equation ( [ eq : pod ] ) , we use the concept of library building which arises in machine learning from leveraging low - rank  features \" from data . in the rom community",
