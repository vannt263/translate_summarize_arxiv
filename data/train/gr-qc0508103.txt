    "the conservation law of energy - momentum ( or the definition of energy - momentum density ) for the gravitational field is one of the most fundamental and controversial problems in general relativity . as a true field",
    ", it would be natural to expect that gravity should has its own local energy - momentum density .",
    "however , it is usually asserted that such a density can not be locally defined because of the equivalence principle.@xcite as a consequence , many attempts to identify an energy - momentum density for the gravitational field lead to complexes that are not true tensors .",
    "the first of such attempt was made by einstein who proposed an expression for the energy - momentum density of the gravitational field .",
    "bauer and shrdinger @xcite pointed out that einstein s expression of the energy - momentum density has a serious shortcoming , i.e. , it holds true only in the quasi - galilean coordinate system and that the transformation of the description of flat space from rectangular coordinates to spherical coordinates results in a nonzero energy density which yields an infinite total energy .",
    "indeed it was nothing but the canonical expression obtained from nether s theorem @xcite and this quantity is a pseudotensor , an object that depends on the coordinate system . among the class of conserved quantities , the landau - lifshitz @xcite quantity is the only symmetric one .",
    "the advantage of symmetry is that it is easy in this case to construct further conservation laws in invariant integral form , which in turn are related to the angular momentum .",
    "but this did not overcome the difficulty of einstein s complex and was also only admissible in quasi - galilean coordinates .",
    "so landau s expression also has the same defects as einstein s .",
    "one of the present authors ( duan ) had proposed one form of the conservation law of energy - momentum in riemann space time,@xcite in which the energy - momentum has a lorentz index and a riemann index , and hence is a covariant vector in riemann space time .",
    "this conservation law is general covariant and it overcomes the flaw of the einstein and landau @xcite forms of the energy - momentum conservation law .",
    "it can explain the nonzero energy flux density and energy density for bondi s plane wave , and get the correct gravitational radiation formula,@xcite where one could not get the nonzero energy density for bondi s plane wave by mller s",
    "formula.@xcite this conservation law had been generalized to the general space time.@xcite    on the other hand , theories with extra dimensions have recently attracted enormous attention .",
    "the possible existence of such dimensions got strong motivation from theories that try to incorporate gravity and gauge interactions in a unique scheme , in a reliable manner .",
    "the idea dates back to the 1920 s , to the works of kaluza and klein @xcite who tried to unify electromagnetism with einstein gravity by assuming that the photon originates from the fifth component of the metric .",
    "in the course of the last several years , there has been active interest in the brane world scenarios @xcite and fermionic zero modes in large dimensions.@xcite the pioneering work was done by randall and sundrum.@xcite in their works , they present the so called randall - sundrum ( rs ) models @xcite for warped backgrounds , with compact or even infinite extra dimensions . the rsi scenario provides a way to solve the hierarchy problem , and the rsii scenario gives newton s law of gravity on the brane of positive tension embedded in an infinite extra dimension .    as in the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional case , we should have some conservation laws in order to understand high dimensional gravity well . in this paper , we would like to study the simple but typical rs models .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present the relationship between conservation theorems and invariance properties of physical systems in the models .",
    "it is the extension of previous works and includes the original general relativity formula of einstein . in the present paper",
    "we pay more attention to the energy - momentum conservation law based on the lagrangian which includes the contribution of the branes in rs models , and prove that there exists a superpotential with respect to the lagrangian .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in section [ rsconservationii ]",
    ", we give a general description of the scheme for establishing general covariant conservation laws in general relativity . in section [ rsconservationiii ] ,",
    "we first give a simple review of the general displacement transform and the rs models , then use the general displacement transform and the scheme to obtain a general covariant conservation law of energy - momentum for rs models . at the last of this section",
    ", we calculate the energy density and the total energy and momentum of the bulk for randall - sundrum solution by the superpotential .",
    "section [ rsconservationiv ] is devoted to some remarks and discussions .",
    "the conservation law is one of the important problems in gravitational theory .",
    "it is due to the invariance of the action corresponding to some transforms . in order to study the covariant energy - momentum law of more complicated systems ,",
    "it is necessary to discuss conservation laws by nether theorem in the general case.@xcite suppose that the space - time manifold @xmath1 is of dimension @xmath2 and the lagrangian density is in the first order formalism , i.e. @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the general fields . if the action is invariant under the infinitesimal transformations @xmath5 and @xmath6 vanishes on the boundary of @xmath7 , @xmath8 , then following relation holds @xcite @xmath9_{\\phi^{a}}\\delta_{0}\\phi^{a}=0 , \\label{noethertheorem}\\ ] ] where @xmath10_{\\phi^{a}}=\\frac{{\\partial}{\\cal{l}}}{{\\partial}\\phi^{a}}-{\\partial}_{\\mu } \\frac{{\\partial}{\\cal{l}}}{{\\partial}{\\partial}_{\\mu}\\phi^{a}},\\ ] ] and @xmath11 is the lie derivative of @xmath4 @xmath12    if @xmath13 is the total lagrangian density of the system , the field equation of @xmath4 is just @xmath14_{\\phi^{a}}=0 $ ] . hence from eq .",
    "( [ noethertheorem ] ) , we can obtain the conservation equation corresponding to transformations ( [ transformation1 ] ) and ( [ transformation2 ] ) @xmath15 it is important to recognize that if @xmath13 is not the total lagrangian , e.g. the gravitational part @xmath16 , then so long as the action of @xmath16 remains invariant under transformations ( [ transformation1 ] ) and ( [ transformation2 ] ) , eq . ( [ noethertheorem ] ) is still valid yet eq .",
    "( [ conservationeq ] ) is no longer admissible because of @xmath17_{\\phi^{a}}\\not=0 $ ] .",
    "in 3 + 1 dimension , the conservation of energy - momentum in special relativity is a consequence of the invariant property of the action under the infinitesimal translation of the lorentz coordinates @xmath33 the corresponding transformation of arbitrary coordinates in flat spacetime is @xmath34 where @xmath35 if we extend this idea to general relativity , we have the generalized translation transformation @xcite @xmath36 using the invariance of the action with respect to _ general displacement transformations _ ( [ translation ] ) and einstein equations , we get the following general covariant conservation law of energy - momentum @xmath37 the total energy - momentum is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the superpotential @xmath40 \\sqrt{-g}.\\ ] ] this definition of energy - momentum has the following main properties :    1 ) . it is a covariant definition with respect to general coordinate transformations .",
    "but the energy - momentum tensor is not covariant under local lorentz transformations , this is reasonable because of the equivalence principle .    2 ) .",
    "for a closed system , the total energy - momentum does not depend on the choice of riemann coordinates and transformations in the covariant way @xmath41 under local lorentz transformation @xmath42 which is constant @xmath43 at spatial infinity .",

    "we can see that the energy density is determined by @xmath51 which always has positive values .",

    "the energy - momentum and angular momentum constitute a 3-poincare algebra and the energy coincides with the adm energy.@xcite    in the next subsection , we first give a brief introduction of the rs models .",
    "then , with these foundations above , we use ( 4 + 1)-dimensional transformations ( [ translation ] ) to obtain conservative energy - momentum for rs models .",
    "let us consider the following setup .",
    "a five dimensional spacetime with an orbifolded fifth dimension of radius @xmath52 and coordinate @xmath53 which takes values in the interval @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "consider two branes at the fixed ( end ) points @xmath55 ; with tensions @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively .",
    "the brane at @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) is usually called the hidden ( visible ) or planck ( sm ) brane .",

    "we shall assume that all parameters are of the order the planck scale .",
    "the classical action describing the above setup is given by @xmath61 here @xmath62 gives the bulk contribution , whereas the visible and hidden brane parts are given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 stands for the induced metric at the visible and hidden branes , respectively .",

    "( [ tt ] ) and ( [ v ] ) , we can get the energy density @xmath109 : @xmath110 clearly , from this expression , it can be concluded that the energy of the bulk distributes mainly near the planck brane and force lines are denser near this brane .",
    "this conclusion can be used to explain why the gravitation on the sm brane ( is our universe ) is very weak .",
    "to summarize , by the use of general nether theorem , we have obtained the conservation law of energy - momentum for the rs models with the respect to the general displacement transform .",
    "the energy - momentum current has a superpotential and are therefore identically conserved .",
    "general covariance is a fundamental demand for conservation laws in general relativity , and our definition eqs .",
    "( [ tt ] ) and ( [ pa ] ) of energy - momentum is coordinate independent .",
    "this conservation law is a covariant theory with respect to the generalized coordinate transformations , but the energy - momentum tensor is not covariant under the local lorentz transformation which , due to the equivalent principle , is reasonable to require .",
    "the conservative energy - momentum current and the corresponding superpotential for the rs models are the same with those in ( 3 + 1)- and ( 2 + 1)-dimensional einstein theories , the lagrangian density @xmath111 corresponding to the hidden and visible brane parts do not play a role in the conservation law , but they have an influence to the energy of gravity . both energy - momentum current and the superpotential",
    "are determined only by vierbein field .",
    "it is shown that , for the solution that gives a flat induced metric on the branes , the momentum vanishes but the total energy of bulk is infinite .",
    "this is quite different from the solution of an isolated system in 3 + 1 dimension .",
    "the reason is that , though the branes are flat , the extra dimension is warped even at the infinite of them .",
    "when the extra dimension disappears , the bulk is just degenerated into our four dimensional flat spacetime and the energy vanishes . from the energy density formula ( [ energydensity ] )",
    ", one can see that most of the bulk energy is localized near the planck brane , so the gravity on the sm brane is very weak .",
    "we think a conservation law of angular momentum @xcite is also important in order to understand the conservative quantities for the rs models .",
    "this conservation law has been obtained using the approach in ref . .",
