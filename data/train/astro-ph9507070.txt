    "the formation of massive stars is an important , but vexed , question , largely because such stars disrupt their natal environment by their powerful winds and ultraviolet radiation fields .",
    "the ultracompact  regions ( uchiir ) , which are found deep within molecular clouds , may provide significant information on the properties and environment of the very youngest massive stars .",
    "uchiir  are highly obscured at optical wavelengths and most information on them derives from infrared and high frequency radio data .",
    "a comprehensive overview of their properties is given by churchwell ( 1990 ) .",
    "they have high emission measures ( @xmath2 ) and small scale sizes ( @xmath3 ) and thus high r.m.s .",
    "electron densities ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the ionizing photon supply rates necessary to maintain the observed ionization are in the approximate range @xmath5@xmath6 , corresponding roughly to zams spectral types b2o5 for single star ionization .",
    "there is , however , considerable evidence from comparison of ir and radio data , that groups of stars may be embedded within a given uchiir  and also that the dust content of the region may absorb nearly all the uv photons generated by the stars ( kurtz , churchwell & wood 1994 ) .",
    "consequently , the assignment of a unique spectral type to the exciting source is an extremely uncertain procedure .",
    "uchiir  have a wide range of observed morphologies .",
    "churchwell ( 1990 ) defines 5 main morphological types : cometary ( @xmath7 per cent ) , core - halo ( @xmath8 per cent ) , shell ( @xmath9 per cent ) , irregular or multiply peaked ( @xmath10 per cent ) and spherical and unresolved ( @xmath11 per cent ) .",
    "most theoretical attention has been given to cometary regions (  van buren & mac low 1992 ) .",
    "they can be modelled fairly convincingly as the steady - state partially ionized structures behind bow shocks driven into molecular cloud material by the winds of moving stars .",
    "although mac low  ( 1991 ) suggest that morphologies other than cometary ( in particular core - halo ) can be explained as cometary structures viewed along the axis of symmetry , it seems likely that other models need consideration .",
    "for example , kurtz , churchwell & wood ( 1994 ) give evidence for a size - density relationship for spherical or unresolved regions .",
    "this is neither present nor would be expected for cometary uchiir .",
    "dyson ( 1994 ) suggested that a natural explanation for at least some uchiir  arises from the interaction between an early type star and a very clumpy , as opposed to relatively homogeneous , molecular cloud .",
    "molecular clouds are well established to be clumpy on length scales down to the limits of observational resolution .",
    "clumps can act as localised reservoirs of gas which can be injected into the surroundings by photoionization and/or hydrodynamic ablation .",
    "the continuous injection of material into a  region can lead to a quasi steady - state configuration which is bounded by a recombination front ( rf ) as opposed to the ionization front ( if ) which bounds standard  regions .",
    "this particular configuration avoids the expansion problems associated with a ` classical '  region model for uchiir , which would expand on a timescale far shorter than the characteristic @xmath12 lifetime of uchiir  estimated from the statistics of uchiir  association with early type stars ( churchwell 1990 ) .",
    "regions bounded by recombination fronts can be held in equilibrium by gas pressure or recoil pressure depending on whether the flow exits sub- or super - sonically .",
    "we discuss here a particularly simple model where a star with both a uv radiation field and a powerful hypersonic wind interacts with clumpy material and show that it may explain the structure of shell - like uchiir .",
    "further papers in this series will investigate in detail the full range of models outlined by dyson ( 1994 )",
    ". a future key test of all these models will be the observational determination of the kinematics of ionized gas , molecular gas and neutral hydrogen associated with such uchiir .",
    "non - steady models with photoionization - induced mass injection have also been suggested by lizano  ( 1995 ) .",
    "one major difference between their models and those given here and by dyson ( 1994 ) is that lizano  assume a very specific model for the mass injection process which leads to a close coupling between the spatial and temporal behaviour of the mass injection and the radiation field .",
    "we treat mass injection as a free parameter and assume here that it is constant in space and time .",
    "dyson ( 1994 ) has discussed some of the factors involved in the mass injection process and emphasised that both hydrodynamics and photoinjection may play roles .",
    "it is clear that both approaches need investigation .",
    "in this initial paper , we assume that the hypersonic wind from a single star blows into a clumpy molecular cloud and that mass injection into the flow occurs at a constant volume rate @xmath13 near to the star .",
    "mass injected into a fast wind will slow the wind down . the frictional energy dissipated in this process",
    "may be radiated away by , for example , enhanced radiative losses in boundary layers ( hartquist & dyson 1993 ) .",
    "we assume that this occurs here and that the flow is photoionized by the stellar radiation field and remains isothermal at the usual photoionization equilibrium temperature @xmath14 .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the isothermality of mass loaded winds is given elsewhere ( williams , hartquist & dyson 1995 ) .",
    "we assume that mass loading occurs only in the ionized region and that the flow always remains supersonic .",
    "we neglect the possibility of global shocks in the flow produced by mass injection . this will be a valid assumption provided that the mach number in the ionized region is not predicted to fall below about 2 ( williams  1995 ) .",
    "the recombination front which then occurs has supersonic inflow and outflow (  newman & axford 1968 ) .",
    "a discussion of the consequences of global shocks and subsequent transonic flow for rf structures is given elsewhere ( williams & dyson , in preparation ) .",
    "for steady supersonic flow with uniform mass loading , the mass and momentum conservation equations are respectively @xmath15 and @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are respectively the flow velocity and density , @xmath19 is the radial coordinate and @xmath20 and @xmath21 the stellar wind mass loss rate and velocity .",
    "we have assumed that the mass flux in the flow is dominated by gas ablated from the clumps .",
    "then from equations   and  , @xmath22 clearly , radiation such as bremsstrahlung and recombination lines , which have emissivities proportional to @xmath23 , will be dominated by the outer regions of the flow .",
    "the rf occurs at a radius , @xmath24 , where the photon output rate balances the recombination rate .",
    "we assume an effective stellar output of @xmath25 in the lyman continuum ( which may be only a small fraction of that actually generated by the star because of absorption by dust ) .",
    "we assume ( and justify later ) that if mass injection is a result of photoionization , it needs only a negligibly small fraction of the available uv .",
    "if the observed nebula is ionization bounded , then it must be powered by a lyman continuum flux of @xmath26 where @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) follows from equation  , @xmath29 is the mean mass per nucleon and is the hydrogen recombination coefficient .",
    "thus from equation   @xmath30 we treat @xmath13 as a free parameter since it is presumably determined by factors such as the density of mass loading centres and the mode of ablation ( section 1 ) .",
    "equation   implies that we can neglect any appreciable contributions to the radio emission from the mass loading centres themselves (  from dense ionized clump surfaces ) , and so the measured r.m.s .",
    "electron density is that of the flow and is given by @xmath31^{1/2}.\\ ] ] from equation   therefore @xmath32 the mach number just before the rf is @xmath33 inserting characteristic values @xmath34 ; @xmath35 ; @xmath36 ; @xmath37 and @xmath38 , equations   and   become @xmath39 the mass injection rate required is @xmath40    the mach number at the recombination front from equation   is smaller than required , for the values of @xmath41 and @xmath42 derived from observation , unless the momentum input ( for the observed @xmath41 ) is considerably larger than that found for field ob stars .",
    "dust significantly reduces the fraction of @xmath43 which ionizes the nebula ( and thus increases the effective @xmath44 ) ; however , in the sample of kurtz , the fraction of the stellar luminosity absorbed by dust is less for the earlier type stars which would have stronger winds .",
    "the presence of multiple stars within a single uchiir  may also have an effect .",
    "it is certain that the flow will have significant density inhomogeneities .",
    "these can decrease the radius of the recombination front for given mass fluxes and ionizing luminosity .",
    "we assume that the inhomogeneities have a large density contrast , and that the dense gas dominates both the emission and the mass flux compared to the more tenuous surrounding gas . in this case , the mach number of the recombination front [ equation  ] scales as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the volume filling factor of the dense regions ; the mean density of the flow at any radius is @xmath47 times smaller than that derived ( for observed @xmath43 and @xmath24 ) by assuming a smooth flow .",
    "high resolution images of uchiir  do indeed show a strongly clumped structure (  kurtz  1994 ) . in the present paper",
    "we assume that the dense gas has a large ( @xmath48 ) covering factor as seen from the central star , and that the dense gas is well coupled to the global flow .",
    "exploration of these assumptions demands a treatment of intermediate scale structure in the flow ( dyson , hartquist & williams , in preparation ) .",
    "we have also assumed here that the filling factor is independent of radius .    to see whether the required mass injection is plausible and also compatible with the assumptions in the model we treat the very special case where the mass injection comes from the surfaces of pressure confined self - gravitating isothermal clumps ( dyson 1968 ; kahn 1969 ) .",
    "kahn ( 1969 ) showed that the mass loss rate from such a photoionized globule had the remarkable property of being dependent only on the sound speed @xmath49 in the neutral gas of the globule .",
    "we adopt his mass loss rate from a globule @xmath50 , where the sound speed in the cloud is @xmath51 to allow for its being cold and molecular .",
    "the number of clumps @xmath52 required within the uchiir  is thus @xmath53 which appears plausible .",
    "the fraction , @xmath54 , of photons used up in the photoinjection process itself is @xmath55 , which is consistent with the assumptions made .    mass loss driven by ionization from gravitationally confined clumps",
    "is just one of a wide range of possibilities .",
    "hydrodynamical ablation may play an important role in releasing gas from the clumps , for instance , as may magnetic fields in maintaining inhomogeneities within a global flow .",
    "there must be several tens of mass loading clumps within the uchiir , if our continuum approximation is to be reasonably valid .",
    "there is strong observational evidence for such clumping in the emitting gas , ten or more individual emission peaks being visible in the better - resolved images in the survey by kurtz , churchwell & wood ( 1994 ) .",
    "this characteristic number of clumps implies a space density of @xmath56 .",
    "the clumps may be related to the partially ionized globules ( pigs ) and protoplanetary disks around low mass stars ( proplyds , odell & wen 1994 ) observed distributed in orion nebula .",
    "the peak number density of stars in the low mass stellar cluster around the trapezium ob stars is at least @xmath57 ( mccaughrean & stauffer 1995 ) . while the observed velocity structure of these sources ( massey & meaburn 1995 ) may well be similar to that of the mass - loading clumps in uchiir , the orion nebula is a far older  region than those discussed here .",
    "it is likely that in the near vicinity of a very young massive star , there will also be many , more transient , local density enhancements which have not quite passed the threshold for star formation . in @xmath58 , between 1 and @xmath59 of gas will pass through a near - sonic recombination front , suggesting a mean density of clump gas in the region ( @xmath60 ) , comparable to the mean mass density of the proplyd stars in orion .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the keplerian velocity at the edge of an uchiir  ( around @xmath61 ) and the relative velocity necessary to transit the uchiir  in its lifetime ( around @xmath62 ) to the mean velocity dispersion of the trapezium stars ( around @xmath63 ) .",
    "a significant flux of new clumps will enter the uchiir  during its lifetime , either through random motions or systematic infall ; the density of clumps within the region may also be significantly enhanced by gravitational focussing effects .",
    "in order to satisfy the requirement that no global shocks occur in the uchiir , we require @xmath64 ( section 2 ) , @xmath65 .",
    "we therefore choose as an illustrative set of parameters @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "we then find the observed r.m.s .",
    "density , @xmath70 ( equivalent to an r.m.s .",
    "density in the smoothed flow of @xmath71 ) , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in figure  [ f : emplot ] , we show the emission measure , @xmath75 , as a function of offset @xmath76 from the star ( where @xmath76 is given in units of @xmath24 ) .",
    "the total emission is normalized so that @xmath77 the rapid rise of density close to the recombination front , equation  , leads to an edge brightened structure in both line flux and in the far stronger free - free continuum .",
    "the peak intensity is more than twice that at the centre of the of the region , for @xmath74 .    in figure",
    "[ f : lineprof ] , we show line profiles for an optically thin recombination line ( @xmath78 ) at @xmath79 and @xmath80 . for flows with mach numbers @xmath81 at the recombination front ,",
    "the predicted line profiles are symmetric but noticeably double - peaked , particularly in the weaker emission lines close to the centre of the nebula . for smaller mach numbers at the rf",
    ", the line profiles will be singly peaked , although noticeably broadened and variable across an individual uchiir .",
    "continuum optical depths may lead to a systematic blueshift of the emission in lower frequency recombination lines .",
    "clearly , observations of radio recombination line profiles is a key test of the model presented here .    in figure",
    "[ f : simplemod ] , we show the structure of the uchiircalculated for the simple model parameters given above , assuming that the gas is everywhere isothermal , at @xmath82 ( cf .",
    "arthur , dyson & hartquist 1994 ) .",
    "this is a fairly reasonable assumption within the ionized nebula . outside the recombination front",
    ", the gas would be expected to cool adiabatically ; however , since the gas is supersonic here , the cooling will have little dynamical effect . beyond the ionized region ,",
    "the mach number plotted should be interpreted as the flow velocity scaled to the isothermal sound speed .",
    "note that the neutral hydrogen emerging from the rf has a velocity of @xmath83 .",
    "clearly , the observation of neutral material with high radial velocities close to the projected centre of an uchiir  would again constitute a crucial test of such models .",
    "in this paper , we have discussed one of the mechanisms for the formation of ultracompact  regions introduced by dyson  ( 1994 ) .",
    "winds around young massive stars mass - loaded by the remaining shreds of the molecular cloud from which the star initially formed can naturally explain many of the properties of spherical uchiir .    for parameters characteristic of spherical uchiir , the mass - loaded stellar wind will remain supersonic at all radii , so long as the radiating gas has a filling factor @xmath84 .",
    "this filling factor is close to the preferred range @xmath85 quoted by afflerbach  ( 1994 ) from a non - lte analysis of recombination line ratios for the ( cometary ) uchiir  g29.96@xmath860.02 , although limb brightening on a finer scale than the observational resolution would bias their results towards small values .",
    "we have shown predicted line profiles and distribution of emission measure across and uchiir .",
    "the double - peaks of line profiles , particularly close to the centre of the nebula , are a strong observational diagnostic , so long as sufficient spatial and spectral resolution can be obtained .",
    "observations of sufficient quality are now beginning to become available for analysis .    in future papers",
    ", we will extend the work presented here to treat centre - bright nebulae ( most naturally understood as flows which are subsonic for a substantial range of radii ) .",
    "we will also include more details of the radiation transfer process ( such as continuum optical depths and stimulated emission ) , of the wind - clump interfaces and of the distribution and dynamical effects of dust .",
    "preliminary models incorporating more realistic heating and cooling rates predict temperatures appreciably greater than @xmath87 in the inner regions .",
    "this will result in edge brightening even more pronounced than that shown above ( williams , dyson & redman , in preparation ) .",
    "radio recombination lines from helium and carbon , while fainter than those of hydrogen will give better velocity resolution ; the differences in ionization potential between these atoms means that comparison of their line profiles will yield important additional information on the radial structure of the nebula .",
    "the authors wish thank the anonymous referee , in particular for suggesting that we extend the discussion of the nature of clumps , and robert massey for discussions on the trapezium cluster .",
    "this work was supported by pparc both through the rolling grant to the astronomy group at manchester ( rjrw ) and through a graduate studentship ( mpr ) ."
