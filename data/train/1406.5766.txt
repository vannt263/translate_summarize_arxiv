    "during the last decade a plentiful contamination between condensed matter physics and quantum information theory has been exploited . on the one hand , many body systems exhibiting quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) , usually studied in terms of order parameters , correlation lengths and symmetry breaking  @xcite have been fruitully analyzed in terms of quantum information based tools , such as dynamics of correlation in the ground state ( gs ) of the systems  @xcite and quantum information geometry @xcite . on the other hand , quantum critical systems have been shown to provide a resource for quantum estimation and metrology , offering superextensive precision in the characterization of coupling parameters and thermometry @xcite .",
    "the keystone of quantum estimation theory ( qet ) resides in the quantum version of the fisher information  @xcite , a measure that accounts for the statistical distinguishability of a quantum state from its neighboring ones .",
    "indeed , the geometrical approach to qpt has shown how to improve estimation strategies for experimental inaccessible parameter by driving the system towards critical points , where a sudden change in the ground state structure takes place  @xcite .",
    "in particular this behaviour has been tested in models where the interaction is restricted to first neighbors  @xcite , e.g. quantum ising and x - y models in an external field , in order to precisely estimate the parameters of the system and to provide useful information about the phase diagram . in view of the attention paid to systems with more sophisticated interaction among lattice sites @xcite",
    "a question thus naturally arises on whether criticality may be exploited to enhance metrology in systems with interaction beyond the first - neighbor approximation .    in this framework",
    ", systems described by the lipkin - meshkov - glick ( lmg ) model provide non trivial examples to assess quantum criticality as a resource for quantum estimation .",
    "lmg was first proposed as a simple test for many - body problems approximations  @xcite and since then it has been used to describe the magnetic properties of several molecules , remarkably mn@xmath2ac  @xcite .",
    "it also found applications in several different fields , leading to a variety of results in terms of entanglement properties of its ground state  @xcite and spin squeezing  @xcite . for finite size chains",
    "lmg have been characterized in terms of fidelity susceptibility  @xcite and adiabatic dynamics  @xcite .",
    "although the lmg model can not be solved analytically for a generic chain size , some of its extensions are amenable to an exact solution @xcite .",
    "we also mention that the lmg model received attention not only theoretically : experimental implementations have been proposed using condensate systems in a double well potential  @xcite or in cavities  @xcite .",
    "it has been also shown that is possible to map the dynamics of such model on circuit qed  @xcite and ion traps  @xcite systems .",
    "for what concerns metrology , the crucial feature of the lmg model is that its hamiltonian depends on two parameters : one is the anisotropy parameter , not accessible to the experimenter , while the other is the external magnetic field , thus experimentally tunable , at least to some extent , in order to drive the system towards criticality .    in this paper , we address quantum metrology in lmg systems .",
    "we first consider the characterization of lmg systems , i.e. the estimation of anisotropy , and show how criticality may be exploited to improve precision . to this aim",
    "we evaluate exactly the quantum fisher information of small - size lmg chains made of @xmath3 and @xmath1 lattice sites and also address the thermodynamical limit by a zero - th order approximation of the system hamiltonian .",
    "our results show that the maxima of the quantum fisher information are obtained on the critical lines in the parameter space , i.e. where the ground state of the system is degenerate .",
    "we also show that the ultimate bounds to precision may be achieved in practice by tuning the external field and by measuring the total magnetization of the system .",
    "we also address the use of lmg systems as quantum thermometers , i.e. we consider a lmg chain in thermal equilibrium with its environment and analyze the estimation of temperature by quantum - limited measurements on the sole lmg system .",
    "we show that the precision is governed by the gap between the lowest energy levels of the systems , such that the field - dependent level crossing provides a metrological resource to extend the operating range of the quantum thermometer .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section [ lmgmodel ] we briefly review the relevant features of the lmg model in its most relevant forms , whereas in section [ qet ] we introduce the tools of quantum estimation theory and establish notation . in section [ qfigamma ]",
    "we analyze in details estimation of anisotropy , whereas section [ qfibeta ] is devoted to lmg systems as quantum thermometers . a perturbation analysis in order to discuss the robustness of the optimal estimators against fluctuations of the external field is the subject of section [ hfl ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ thermo ] we address the thermodynamical limit by means of a zero - th order approximation of the system hamiltonian .",
    "[ conclusion ] closes the paper with some concluding remarks .",
    "in this section we review the main features of the lipskin - meshkov - glick model . as a matter of fact , the model has been widely studied in many branches of science and it is known in several equivalent forms .",
    "we present the most relevant ones , with emphasis on the symmetries of the system .",

    "the model has the advantage of being simple enough to be solved exactly for small @xmath4 or numerically for large @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , the symmetries of the system allows one to reduce the size of the largest matrix to be diagonalized . at the same time , the system is far to be trivial , and allows one to test the goodness of many approximations techniques @xcite , as well to compare classical and quantum phase transitions @xcite .",

    "in fact , it is possible to provide an estimate of this effect by averaging the qfi over a given distribution for the external field : this is an approximation since the qfi is a nonlinear function of the density operator , but it is not a crude one , owing to the small value of fluctuations that we should consider for this kind of perturbation analysis .    in order to obtain a quantitative estimate we assume that the actual value of the external field is normally distributed around the optimal one @xmath164 , and evaluate the averaged qfi for the anistropy @xmath189 as a function of the width @xmath190 of the gaussian @xmath191 , viewed as a convenient measure of the fluctuations ( i.e. of the imprecise tuning ) of the external field . in particular , we choose the range of @xmath190 as to describe an imprecise tuning of the external field up to @xmath192 . in fig .",
