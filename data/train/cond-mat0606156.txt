    "spatial constraints in systems where two ( or more ) bulk phases coexist may lead to wetting transitions .",
    "this is the case , for example , of confined fluids where one of two coexisting equilibrium phases ( the liquid , say ) is in contact with a substrate with an interface separating it from the second phase ( the gas ) at infinity .",
    "the liquid _ does not wet _ the substrate if the thickness of the liquid film is finite ( there is a microscopic quantity of liquid ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the substrate is _ wet _ if there is a macroscopically thick liquid film on it .",
    "a wetting transition is said to occur when the substrate changes from not being wet by the liquid to being wet .",
    "typically , two types of wetting transitions can be considered : by increasing the temperature at bulk coexistence one may find either _",
    "critical wetting _ or a discontinuous transition ; by varying the chemical potential while the temperature is fixed above the wetting transition temperature one finds a _",
    "complete wetting _ transition , at bulk coexistence . under equilibrium conditions , a completely analogous transition ( often called drying ) may occur when the substrate preferentially adsorbs the gas phase @xcite .",
    "effective interfacial potentials are useful coarse - grained models that have played a key role in understanding a large variety of equilibrium wetting problems @xcite",
    ". these potentials , @xmath0 , are functionals of the interfacial height ( measured from the substrate ) , @xmath1 . in this framework ,",
    "wetting transitions are described as the unbinding of the ( say liquid - vapor ) interface from the substrate , with the effective binding potential determined by the microscopic forces between the constituents of the substrate and those of the bulk phases .",
    "typically , exponentials and power - law decaying potentials @xmath0 have been considered for systems dominated by short - ranged and long - ranged forces , respectively .",
    "there exist a large amount of phenomena describable in terms of equilibrium wetting , either under short - range or under long - ranged interactions , while it has only recently been recognized that non - equilibrium effects , such as anisotropies in the interface growing rules , may play a crucial role in describing some experimental situations . within this perspective , short - ranged _ non - equilibrium wetting _ has been studied @xcite , and some interesting novel phenomenology has been elucidated ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) . in particular , liquid - crystals @xcite , molecular - beam epitaxial systems , as @xmath2 @xcite , or materials exhibiting stranski - krastanov instabilities @xcite , appear to be good candidates to require a non - equilibrium wetting description",
    ". however , some of these systems , as well as many others not enumerated , might include effective long - range substrate - interface effects as also occurs in the equilibrium case .",
    "our goal in this paper is to fill this gap by providing a general and systematic theory of non - equilibrium wetting under the presence of effective long - ranged interactions .",
    "first , we briefly review the equilibrium situation to set up the theoretical framework and , afterwards , generalize it to embrace non - equilibrium situations .    in equilibrium ,",
    "two types of analytical approaches are available : static studies based on the ensemble theory @xcite and dynamical , stochastic approaches that allow investigating relaxational aspects .",
    "the second approach is amenable to non - equilibrium extensions and is the one we employ .",
    "thus , consider the simple edwards - wilkinson dynamics @xcite subject to a bounding force ( i.e. the derivative of the bounding potential ) @xcite : @xmath3 this includes ( * i * ) the usual diffusion term , computed as minus the derivative of a standard surface - tension term , ( * ii * ) the driving force , @xmath4 , related to the chemical potential difference between the two phases , ( * iii * ) the gaussian white noise , @xmath5 , and ( * iv * ) the bounding force , which may derive from a short - ranged potential @xmath6 or from a long - ranged one @xmath7 where , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are parameters . this last form , eq.([lr ] ) , is known to be the correct functional form for systems where the molecules interact through van der waals forces @xcite .    by varying the chemical - potential , @xmath4 ,",
    "one controls the average interfacial distance from the wall : small for @xmath11 ( non - wet phase ) , large for @xmath12 , and increasing steadily with time for @xmath13 ( wet phase ) , i.e. the system exhibits an unbinding transition at @xmath14 .",
    "the interface potentials @xmath0 are , in all cases , harshly repulsive at small @xmath15 to model the impenetrability of the substrate .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 vanishes linearly with the temperature , at the ( mean - field ) critical wetting temperature , and represents the affinity or preference of the substrate for one of the bulk phases ( usually the liquid ) .",
    "we consider three distinct situations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) :    _ 1 .",
    "repulsive potential : complete wetting_. if @xmath16 the potential describes the presence of a bounding substrate alone . in this case",
    ", the broken symmetry induced by the substrate leads to the divergence of the average position of the interface , at coexistence , @xmath17 : i.e. the system undergoes a _",
    "complete wetting _ transition .",
    "the latter is described by eq .",
    "( [ ewwall ] ) with the potential taken from eq .",
    "( [ sr ] ) .",
    "two different regimes depending on the value of @xmath18 have been reported : for @xmath19 mean - field scaling holds and @xmath20 , while if @xmath21 fluctuations take over and the velocity is controlled by the intrinsic roughness of a free edwards - wilkinson , leading to a fluctuation - dominated regime characterized by @xmath22 ( @xmath23 , or logarithmic growth for two - dimensional interfaces ) .",
    "these results are derived in a formal way and extended in the appendix .",
    "attractive potential : first order unbinding_. for @xmath24 , by contrast to the complete wetting case , the surface does not promote the growth of the liquid phase and consequently there is no wetting phase even at bulk coexistence , @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath0 exhibits a local minimum near the substrate , that binds the interface in the presence of thermal fluctuations , and the width of the wetting layer is finite ( microscopic ) at @xmath25 .",
    "we may , however , observe a first - order unbinding transition that occurs as @xmath4 changes from positive ( stable bulk liquid ) to negative ( stable bulk gas ) values .",
    "critical wetting_. at a particular value of @xmath26 ( @xmath27 in mean - field but more generally @xmath28 is small and negative ) critical wetting may be observed , with a characteristic non - trivial phenomenology .",
    "this situation requires the fine tuning of two independent parameters ( @xmath29 , @xmath14 ) .",
    "this critical transition is more difficult to treat theoretically and less likely to be found in real systems and will not be discussed in this paper .",
    "the best way to extend equilibrium approaches to more general , non - equilibrium , situations is to consider the simplest and widely studied non - equilibrium extension of the edwards - wilkinson equation , i.e. the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) @xcite interfacial dynamics @xcite , in the presence of effective bounding potentials , as the ones we have described before .",
    "this strategy has been followed in a series of recent papers for systems with short - ranged ( attractive and purely repulsive ) potentials @xcite and will be extended in the present work to the case of long - ranged potentials .",
    "we will discuss the phase diagrams for both purely repulsive and attractive potentials , paying special attention to criticality and to the comparison with equilibrium wetting and non - equilibrium short - ranged unbinding .",
    "we will focus on one - dimensional interfaces ( separating two - dimensional bulk phases ) , and mention briefly two - dimensional interfaces in the conclusions .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the non - equilibrium unbinding model . in section 3 ,",
    "we review known results for non - equilibrium short - ranged unbinding .",
    "section 4 contains the main body of the paper , including both analytical and numerical results for purely repulsive and attractive potentials .",
    "finally , the main conclusions are presented together with a discussion of our results .",
    "our model consists in a kpz non - equilibrium interface @xcite in the presence of a long - ranged , bounding potential eq .",
    "( [ lr ] ) , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the coefficient of the non - linear kpz term , the only new ingredient added to the equilibrium wetting langevin eq .",
    "( [ ewwall ] ) .",
    "note that in equilibrium the time - dependent probability distribution @xmath32 is symmetric for the free interface and therefore it does not make any difference which side faces the substrate . by contrast , under non - equilibrium conditions , owing to the @xmath33 asymmetry of the kpz - equation , it depends on the sign of @xmath34 that the substrate probes either one tail or the other of a kpz probability distribution that is no longer symmetric .",
    "thus , for a given bounding potential two different situations must be considered .",
    "therefore , we will investigate systems with positive and negative values of @xmath34 ( without loss of generality we take @xmath35 ) , and with both attractive ( @xmath36 ) and repulsive ( @xmath16 ) potentials , i.e. we consider _ four distinct cases_. the focus is mainly on one - dimensional interfaces .    for _ analytical studies",
    "_ we employ simple power - counting arguments to establish the relevance or irrelevance of the new terms at the equilibrium renormalization group fixed points .",
    "these will be combined with heuristic and scaling arguments , to relate the emerging critical behavior to equilibrium wetting and short - ranged non - equilibrium unbinding .    for _ numerical studies _ , we consider one - dimensional discretizations of eq .",
    "( [ kpzwalllr ] ) . as direct integrations of kpz - like equations",
    "are known to be plagued with numerical instabilities @xcite , we resort to the exponential or cole - hopf transformation , @xmath37 , that leads to well - behaved , numerically tractable , langevin equations with multiplicative noise @xcite . in order to integrate these equations",
    "we employ a recently proposed efficient numerical scheme @xcite , specifically designed to deal with stochastic equations with non - additive noise .",
    "more than just a useful technical trick , this transformation has an interesting physical motivation , as we discuss next . for negative values of @xmath38 , the average interfacial height @xmath39 ( thickness of the liquid film ) may be large but finite , and the interface fluctuates around its average position , occasionally touching the substrate . as the interface moves to infinity",
    "when @xmath40 , its average height grows ( i.e. the liquid film completely wets the substrate ) thereby suppressing contact ( dry ) sites .",
    "an appropriate order - parameter ( op ) for the unbinding transition is the number of contact ( dry ) sites @xcite , or equivalently the surface order parameter @xcite .",
    "this op is finite and positive when the interface is bound , and vanishes at the unbinding transition .",
    "the variable , @xmath41 , that vanishes exponentially far from the wall , is an adequate mathematical representation of such an op ( though not the only one ) .",
    "the main goal of our study is the description of the scaling behavior of the op .",
    "@xmath42 , is expected to obey simple scaling near the critical point , for sufficiently large times , @xmath43 , and large system - sizes @xmath44 . denoting @xmath45 , @xmath46 while right at the transition @xmath47 and",
    "therefore @xmath48 , where the critical exponents were introduced following standard nomenclature .",
    "analogously , for the interfacial height we can define @xmath49 and @xmath50 , although in terms of @xmath15 a single universality class , with exponents related to the free kpz @xcite , is observed for both signs of @xmath34 .",
    "determining all of these critical exponents by the aforementioned techniques will allow us to assign the emerging critical behavior to specific universality classes , providing a comprehensive classification of non - equilibrium unbinding transitions in the presence of long - ranged forces .    before proceeding to the presentation of our results , we notice that it is expected that the behavior for short - ranged interactions is recovered in the large-@xmath18 limit of the long - ranged ones .",
    "next , a brief review of the former is provided .",
    "the kpz equation with exponential bounding potentials is @xmath51 with @xmath52 .",
    "the results for the four possible physical situations are :      if @xmath54 ( we set @xmath55 ) the change of variables @xmath56 transforms ( [ kpzwallsr ] ) ( with @xmath57 ) into @xmath58 this describes complete wetting transitions ( along path 1 in fig .",

    "numerical estimates for the associated universality class have been recently obtained from this ( non - order - parameter ) langevin equation @xcite . by measuring the order parameter @xmath72 ( that vanishes at the transition ) , the following set of exponents",
    "was obtained : @xmath73 , @xmath74 , different from mn1 and @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath59 and @xmath77 in line with the corresponding exponents of the mn1 class @xcite .",
    "this universality class is known as _ multiplicative noise 2 _ ( mn2 ) . a detailed discussion of the differences between the mn2 and mn1 universality classes , may be found in @xcite .",
    "note that , apart from the signs , the difference between eq .",
    "( [ mn1 ] ) and eq .",

    "it is possible , however , to summarize these two langevin equations in @xmath79 with @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "then @xmath82 and @xmath83 correspond , respectively , to the mn1 and mn2 universality classes . in the first case",
    "the leading power for large values of @xmath78 is the non - linear term while this role is taken by the linear term in the second case .",
    "the transition at the boundary @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) is obviously discontinuous , as both terms are linear and there is no saturating term .    in mn1",
    "the order parameter is @xmath78 , while in the mn2 case , it is @xmath86 . in both cases @xmath4 is the control parameter .      for attractive walls , @xmath24 , a positive value of @xmath87",

    "the stationary solution is either bound or unbound depending on the initial conditions @xcite .",
    "such a region is delimited on the right ( where the bound phase loses stability ) by a directed percolation transition , where the scaling properties are controlled by the effective dynamics of the particle - like interface - surface contact points ( i.e. points trapped in the potential well ) .",
    "its leftmost border corresponds to the abrupt ( discontinuous ) binding of initially unbound interfaces .",
    "again we refer the reader to @xcite for a detailed discussion and to @xcite for a review on generic phase - coexistence in non - equilibrium systems .      for @xmath68 ( see fig .",

    "no broad coexistence region , nor directed percolation transition , exist in this case .",

    "as before , if @xmath16 we take @xmath57 for simplicity .",
    "proceeding as in the short - ranged non - equilibrium case , we perform the change of variables @xmath89 , with @xmath90 , in equation ( [ kpzwalllr ] ) , obtaining @xmath91 where a term @xmath92 has to be added when @xmath36 . as before , for positive @xmath34 ( @xmath93 ) ,",
    "the order - parameter is @xmath86 , while for @xmath53 the order - parameter is @xmath78 itself .",
    "note also that as there is a singularity at @xmath94 ( inherited from the singularity at @xmath88 in eq .",
    "( [ kpzwalllr ] ) ) , for @xmath95 , where @xmath78 diverges at the transition , the initial condition is fixed at @xmath96 , while for @xmath97 , where @xmath78 vanishes at the transition , @xmath98 , is taken .",
    "the deterministic one - site terms of eq .",
    "( [ mnlr ] ) may be written as minus the derivative of a potential , @xmath99 , that is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "it is instructive to compare this model with the two universality classes reported for non - equilibrium short - ranged wetting , i.e. mn1 and mn2 .",
    "in fact , it is expected that , in the limit of sufficiently large @xmath18 , the power - law force yields the same dynamics as short - ranged ( exponential ) forces .",
    "thus , for @xmath54 and large @xmath18 we anticipate mn1 behavior while mn2 scaling should obtain when @xmath100 , in the same limit .      in an early work",
    "the kpz non - linearity was argued to be irrelevant above the ( mean - field ) wetting temperature @xmath101 , and an equilibrium ( complete ) wetting transition was predicted to occur as @xmath40 , at constant @xmath102 , for any @xmath34 @xcite ( transitions along path 1 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . in the following",
    "we show that such a prediction is untenable and that the non - equilibrium term leads to new physics .",
    "let us start by employing nave power counting arguments , based on equilibrium scaling , to decide whether @xmath34 is a relevant or an irrelevant perturbation , at the mean - field fixed point and at the fluctuation one .",

    "we would need to include perturbative corrections generated by the new non - linear term proportional to @xmath34 , but even without computing these , one can say that it is very unlikely that such corrections reverse the strong lowest - order relevancy of @xmath34 .",
    "the relevancy of @xmath34 , is strongly supported by the results of numerical simulations of the corresponding langevin equation as we will show next .    as in one - dimensional equilibrium interfaces , where @xmath108 separates the mean - field and the fluctuation - dominated regimes",

    "clearly , if @xmath115 the wall - induced velocity is larger and fluctuations give only a higher order correction ( i.e. they are irrelevant ) .",
    "by contrast , if @xmath116 the effective repulsion generated by the wall ( through suppression of the intrinsic interfacial roughness ) controls the scaling .",
    "thus , in non - equilibrium long - ranged wetting , @xmath109 separates the mean - field from the fluctuation - dominated regimes .",
    "transient effects , that are significant before the non - equilibrium interface develops its full ( asymptotic ) time - dependent roughness , may prevent the kpz exponent @xmath117 from being observed , leading to an effective exponent , @xmath118 . furthermore , at short times , the interface is expected to grow with an edwards - wilkinson exponent , @xmath119 , and therefore @xmath120 , increases progressively from @xmath121 to its asymptotic kpz value , @xmath113 , in the long time regime . comparing these values with the wall induced velocity exponent @xmath122",
