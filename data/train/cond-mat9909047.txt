    "in the past few years the study of shape transitions in lipid monolayer domains at the air - water interface has received considerable attention from the physical - chemical community  @xcite .",
    "the great interest towards this subject is in part due to the diversity of domain shapes , which range from simple circular structures to complex labyrinthine patterns .",
    "theoretical investigations study this variety of shapes by a model in which an array of molecular dipoles is arranged normal to the two - dimensional domain . the basic mechanism behind",
    "the formation of such structures arises from the competition between interfacial tension and long - range electrostatic interactions .",
    "line tension acts to minimize the domain perimeter and favors compact domain shapes .",
    "in contrast , repulsive electrostatic dipole - dipole interaction tends to maximize the distance between dipoles and favors extented domain shapes . in this context",
    ", the total area of the domain is not changed .    in previous work mcconnell",
    "@xcite , deutch and low  @xcite , and goldstein and jackson  @xcite have studied the shape transitions of initially circular ( radius @xmath0 ) lipid monolayer domains in a lowest order ( quadratic ) stability analysis . in all these theoretical studies",
    "many relevant quantities are calculated exactly , but due to their complexity , some of the computed expressions are not evaluated in closed form .",
    "for example , the formulas for stability thresholds found in  @xcite are usually expressed in terms of nontrivial integrals .",
    "related integrals arise in stability investigations of other systems , also presenting polarized domains , such as planar - confined ferrofluids in magnetic fields  @xcite and thin ferromagnetic films forming magnetic bubble patterns  @xcite .",
    "a considerable difficulty to perform stability analysis of lipid monolayer domains is the evaluation of the electrostatic dipole - dipole energies for various domain shapes .",
    "these calculations involve the manipulation of double line integrals which are obtained by an ingenious application of green s theorem  @xcite .",
    "the subtleties concerning the validity of green s theorem under such circumstances are connected to the necessity of introducing a cutoff distance required to prevent divergence at zero separation between dipoles  @xcite . as shown by deutch and low  @xcite , the subtle application of green s theorem",
    "can be avoided by calculating the electrostatic energy directly through area integrals .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to evaluate in closed form the integrals and pertinent stability conditions obtained in reference  @xcite . even though the nontrivial integrals which appear in references  @xcite basically belong to the same general family , we focus on deutch and low s paper  @xcite since their work precisely illustrates the utility of our closed form expressions .",
    "our calculations are performed in the same spirit of those by miranda and widom  @xcite , who recently carried out a related closed form study focused on ferrofluids .",
    "we evaluate the integrals in terms of associated legendre functions .",
    "asymptotic behavior in interesting limits such as small cutoff , or high spatial frequency are rigorously calculated .",
    "finally , we address the case which considers repulsive coulombic interactions within a charged domain .",
    "comparison between our results and those derived in  @xcite is consistently made throughout the text .",
    "we obtain simpler and compact expressions which facilitate the explicit evaluation of many important quantities derived in previous studies of shape transitions in lipid monolayers  @xcite .",

    "consequently , relevant physical quantities like the critical radii @xmath26 ( radii beyond which a circular domain becomes unstable with respect to @xmath4-fold harmonic perturbations ) are often written in an indirect fashion , which involves complicated sums and integrals , or requires the use of recursion relations  @xcite .",

    "again , the major difference between our results resides on the fact that in  @xcite , to get a particular value of @xmath60 it is necessary to appeal to an indirect approach which requires solving several different integrals involving chebyshev polynomials , for each @xmath4 to be considered .",

    "higher modes @xmath64 become unstable at larger @xmath61 . as @xmath61 increases , each mode becomes dominant for a range of radii , and hence there is a cascade to higher modes . for a given critical radius , smaller values of @xmath62 lead to stronger mode competition , meaning more intrincated domain boundaries .",
    "related stability diagrams have been numerically obtained in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the critical parameter @xmath60 is plotted as a function of mode number @xmath4 in the inset of figure 3 .",
    "we begin this section calculating further asymptotic expansions by taking advantage of our closed form expression  ( [ stability1 ] ) .",

    "equation  ( [ largen - smallalpha ] ) is quite general , being valid for large values of @xmath4 and small values of @xmath14 , provided @xmath65 is kept finite .",
    "we would like to point out that our result  ( [ largen - smallalpha ] ) differs from the equivalent one obtained in  @xcite ( see equation ( 46 ) in their work ) .",
    "because of a mistake in their calculation , deutch and low have written their equation ( 46 ) in terms of the modified bessel function of order zero @xmath73 ( there is also a sign error ) , which is not the correct result .",
    "this minor mistake would be of no consequence if the authors in  @xcite would have not derived an important subsequent result , using their incorrect expression ( 46 ) as a starting point .",
    "this fact generates some confusion .",
    "further comments on this issue are given in the next paragraph .",
    "we take advantage of our equation  ( [ largen - smallalpha ] ) to discuss the so - called straight edge limit@xcite .",

    "we take radius @xmath75 at fixed @xmath14 .",

    "this result agrees with equation ( 13 ) in mcconnell s work  @xcite since the line tension considered in his derivation contains an additional electrostatic contribution given by @xmath82  @xcite .",
    "our result  ( [ criticalk ] ) also agrees with the quantity @xmath83 derived by deutch and low ( equation ( 48 ) ) . in principle",
    ", we should not expect agreement since @xmath84 in  @xcite is obtained using their incorrect intermediate expressions ( 46 ) and ( 47 ) , as pointed out in the previous paragraph .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the critical spatial frequency  ( [ criticalk ] ) could have been calculated by taking the large @xmath4 limit of our earlier results  ( [ rn ] ) and  ( [ zn ] ) .",
