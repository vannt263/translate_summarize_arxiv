    "[ intro ]    the relation between the modular and the unitarity properties of open string amplitudes have played a crucial role in deepening our understanding of string theory .",
    "for instance , lovelace  @xcite studied the modular transformation of 1-loop non - planar open string amplitudes . by requiring that these amplitudes do not contain cuts",
    ", he discovered the critical dimension of bosonic string theory .",
    "more than twenty years later polchinski  @xcite used the same modular transformation between the open and the closed string channels on the 1-loop partition function with neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions . by doing",
    "so he was able to show that d - branes are actually dynamical objects that have gravitational couplings with closed strings .",
    "the same interplay between modular transformations and unitarity properties exists also for higher loop amplitudes .",
    "for instance , the open string diagram for the 2-loop planar partition function is a riemann surface with three boundaries and no handles .",
    "this surface can be described either in the closed string channel as in fig .",
    "[ 2l]a , or in the open channel as in fig .",
    "in the first case , by unitarity , one should be able to decompose the result into a @xmath0-vertex among closed strings and three boundary states . in the open string parametrization ,",
    "on the other hand , the same amplitude should factorize into three open strings propagators and two @xmath0-point vertices among open strings .",
    "this double description of the 2-loop partition function is particularly interesting when different left / right gluing conditions are imposed on the various boundaries . in  @xcite the bosonic contribution to the twisted @xmath1-loop partition function",
    "was computed by using the closed string description and then was modular transformed in the open string channel .",
    "it was also shown that the factorization of the 2-loop diagram provides an effective strategy to compute the couplings among twists fields ( @xmath2 ) , which is alternative to the stress - energy tensor technique of  @xcite . from the conformal field theory ( cft )",
    "point of view , these @xmath2 s are operators implementing a change in the boundary conditions for the ( complexified ) bosonic coordinates .",
    "the boundary conditions induced by the @xmath2 s are appropriate to describe open strings stretched between d - branes with constant magnetic fields  @xcite or d - branes at angles  @xcite .",
    "this kind of open strings is one of the main ingredients in d - brane model building ( for a recent review see  @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the @xmath0-twist field correlators mentioned above provide the non - trivial part of the yukawa couplings  @xcite and of other terms in the effective action generated by stringy instantons  @xcite .",
    "g2.pstex_t    in this paper we generalize the results of  @xcite in various ways .",
    "we compute the bosonic contribution to the planar @xmath1-loop partition function for open strings on generic tori with both multiply wound d - branes and non - zero wilson lines or open string moduli .",
    "then we use this result to derive an explicit expression for the 3-twist field correlators valid beyond the case of 2-torus .",
    "however , in our computations , we still keep a technical assumption : the monodromy matrices characterizing the open strings stretched between the d - branes must commute , see eq .  .",
    "this is always the case when the gauge field strengths on the various branes are themselves commuting or parallel .",
    "however this more stringent condition is not necessary and we are able to compute the partition function also for some setups involving oblique fluxes ( according to the nomenclature of  @xcite ) . on the other hand the assumption   will restrict our final results on the twist field couplings to the abelian case .",
    "the d - brane configurations studied in this paper can be promoted to supersymmetry preserving setups , once they are embedded in superstring theory .",
    "this is achieved simply by imposing some constraints on the magnetic fluxes to satisfy the d - term and the f - term conditions .",
    "moreover the latter ones are often automatically implied by our hypothesis  , since it ensures that there is a particular complex basis for the torus where almost all magnetic fluxes are described by @xmath3-forms .    as it was done in  @xcite ,",
    "we compute the twisted partition function in the closed string channel by using the operator formalism ( see  @xcite for detailed discussion ) .",
    "this approach requires particular care in dealing with some phase factors present in the definition of the string vertex operators and boundary states .",
    "the origin of these phases is well - known : in toroidal compactifications the logarithmic branch cut of the bosonic green function can sometime become visible and it is necessary to compensate for this by adding to the string vertices a phase known as cocycle ( see for instance the paragraph `` a technicality '' in sect .",
    "8.2 of  @xcite ) .",
    "all cocycle factors were ignored in  @xcite , but this had no visible effects because , as we will show , these phases were not crucial in the particular examples considered there . however , in general , the partition function is unitary , in the open string channel , only when all phases have been taken into account .",
    "this comes as no surprise because the partition function of fig .",
    "[ 2l]a contains a sum over all possible @xmath0-string vertices and the effect of the cocycles becomes clearly visible since they yield relative phases between different terms .",
    "the presence of these cocycles has some consequences also on the precise formulation of the t - duality transformations .",
    "in fact these transformations should preserve both the spectrum and the interactions , including , in the latter case , the phases needed for ensuring the locality of the interactions .",
    "this does not happen with the naive version of the t - duality rules usually written , and we show that it is necessary to introduce some cocycle phases also in the t - duality transformation to recover a consistent picture .",
    "then we study the degeneration limit of the @xmath4 partition function in the open string channel , see fig .",
    "[ 2l]b , and derive an explicit form for the 3-twist field correlators on arbitrary tori .",
    "this computation , in presence of multiply wrapped d - branes , provides a concrete example showing that the cocycle phases are crucial for unitarity already at the level of the 2-loop partition function .",
    "our result on the 3-twist field couplings generalizes previous expressions valid for configurations that are completely factorized in a product of 2-tori  @xcite , which requires that both the background geometry and the d - brane gauge field strengths are non - trivial only along the same orthogonal @xmath5 s and all `` off - diagonal '' entries are put to zero . even in presence of commuting fluxes",
    "this is a very particular situation , where the so - called classical contribution to the 3-twist field correlators is written in terms of jacobi theta - functions . in general , higher genus theta - functions appear and so the yukawa couplings that arise in non - factorized d - brane models will have a more complicated structure and a richer moduli dependence than those derived so far for the @xmath5 .",
    "however , we still find the same separation between khler and complex structure moduli and only the latter ones enter in the expressions for the classical contribution ( this in the magnetized setup , of course the roles are switched in the language of d - branes at angles ) .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following . in section  [ t2n ]",
    "we briefly review the main features of the string dynamics in toroidal compactifications .",
    "we pay particular care to the cocycle factors in the definition of the vertices and of the boundary states .",
    "we show that these phases enter in a non - trivial way also in the t - duality transformation of the states with non - zero kaluza - klein or winding numbers . in section  [ sectionamplitude ]",
    "we revisit the computation of the twisted partition function discussed in  @xcite and include the effect of the wilson lines and the d - brane multiple wrappings .",
    "the only hypothesis we still take is to restrict ourselves to the case of commuting monodromy matrices ( see eq .  ) . in section  [ tft2d ]",
    "we focus on the @xmath4 case and study the unitarity properties of the result . by doing",
    "so we derive the general expression for the 3-point correlators between abelian twist fields .",
    "finally some technicalities are left to the appendix .",
    "[ t2n ]      a @xmath7-dimensional real torus @xmath6 is defined by a collection of @xmath7 vectors @xmath8 in the euclidean space @xmath9 : @xmath6 is simply @xmath9 modulo the identification with integer shifts along the @xmath8 s @xmath10 one can choose a cartesian reference frame and write the components of each vector @xmath8 as @xmath11 .",
    "then the metric on @xmath6 is are parallel to the lattice defining the torus ; they have period @xmath12 and are referred to as the integral basis . ]",
    "the components of each @xmath8 can be used to fill in the column vectors of a square matrix @xmath14 ; then , by construction , @xmath15 is a vielbein matrix satisfying @xmath16 the inverse matrix @xmath17 instead has the dual vectors @xmath18 as rows : @xmath19 .",
    "of course any other matrix @xmath20 obtained by means of an orthogonal rotation @xmath21 of @xmath15 is a good vielbein matrix .",
    "we can also introduce complex coordinates and the complex vielbein @xmath22 , such that @xmath23 where all the four blocks of @xmath24 are proportional to the @xmath25 identity matrix .",
    "two sets of complex coordinates are inequivalent if they can not be connected by a unitary transformation .",
    "thus the @xmath26 ambiguity in the definition of the @xmath15 s implies that on the same real torus there is a set of inequivalent complex structures which is parametrized by @xmath27 . notice that in the complex coordinates the flat metric @xmath28 is off - diagonal @xmath29    in presence of a constant antisymmetric two - form",
    ", there is a particular complex structure that plays a special role .",
    "of course in our applications this 2-form will be the gauge invariant combination between the kalb - ramond @xmath30-field and @xmath31 , the magnetic field on the d - branes : @xmath32 , thus we will indicate this antisymmetric tensor with @xmath33 already in this section ( notice the different convention with respect to @xcite , as here the factor of @xmath34 in front of @xmath31 is reabsorbed in the definition of a dimensionless magnetic field ) .",
    "its expression in a real cartesian basis is @xmath35 and is related by a similarity transformation to the combination @xmath36 which will be the most relevant in the following sections .",
    "the antisymmetric matrix @xmath37 can be reduced to a block - diagonal form @xmath38 by means of an orthogonal rotation @xmath39 ( where the subscript is just to recall that this transformation depends in general on @xmath33 ) @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a @xmath25 diagonal matrix with real entries @xmath42 .",
    "the vielbein matrix @xmath43 transforms at the same time the metric @xmath44 into the identity and @xmath33 into the block - diagonal matrix  . of course we can use the vielbein matrix @xmath45 to introduce a particular set of complex coordinates ( @xmath46 ) which diagonalizes @xmath36 @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a block - diagonal matrix . from   it",
    "is easy to see that , in this complex basis , @xmath49 is a @xmath3-form . in the following",
    "we will always use , as cartesian basis , the one defined by the vielbeins @xmath45 or @xmath50 , thus we will drop the subscripts without risk of ambiguities . finally let us recall the definition of the complex structure as the mixed tensor @xmath51 in the following sections we will need the expression of @xmath52 in the integral basis , which is easily derived by using the complex vielbein @xmath22 : @xmath53      the coordinates of the closed strings propagating on @xmath6 with a constant background @xmath30-field can be written as a sum of left and right handed fields , and the world - sheet is described by a free cft .",
    "then we have the usual mode expansion @xmath54 and the complexified world - sheet coordinates are @xmath55 @xmath56 and @xmath57 being the world - sheet time and spacial coordinates respectively . upon canonical quantization , the commutation relations for the oscillators in eq .",

    "let us now consider the interacting theory and pay particular attention to the phases necessary when the target space is compact .",
    "the basic building block is the tree - level coupling among three generic closed strings ( reggeon vertex ) .",
    "since there is no preferred ordering of three points on a sphere , this vertex must be invariant under the action of the permutation group exchanging any of the punctures .",
    "the usual emission vertex valid in the uncompact space does not have this property when it is naively generalized to the @xmath6 case .",
    "this is a well known issue , related to the compactness of the target space , and it is a consequence of the logarithmic branch cut of the bosonic green function .",
    "similar problems arise also in the usual formalism of the vertex operators describing the emission of particular on - shell string states ( see , for instance , sect .",
    "8.2 in  @xcite ) . in order to eliminate",
    "this branch cut one has to add suitable cocycle factors to the usual expression of the vertex operators .",
    "here we tackle this issue exactly in the same way by generalising these cocycle factors to the reggeon vertex formalism .    in order to see that the usual @xmath0-string vertex for closed strings is not invariant under the permutation of the external states when the target space is a torus , it is sufficient to focus on the zero - modes contribution .",

    "the oscillator part of the @xmath0-string vertex is invariant under the exchange of the strings @xmath65 , while the zero - mode contribution  ( [ expln ] ) gets a phase given by @xmath66 = \\exp \\left [ -\\ii \\pi \\bigg (    \\hat{n}_1\\hat{m}_2+\\hat{m}_1 \\hat{n}_2 \\bigg ) \\right],\\ ] ] where we have used  . by using this result",

    "however , the cocycle factor added seems to break the vertex invariance under t - duality transformations .",
    "for instance , there is a particular t - duality transformation that exchanges the kaluza - klein and winding operators .",
    "if its effect could be simply written as @xmath68 , as it is usually done , then we could have that @xmath69 for certain external states . in order to clarify this point ,",
    "let us see the transformation properties of @xmath70 under a generic t - duality transformation .",

    "focusing now on the zero - modes , we can derive from  ( [ a ] ) the action of the t - duality transformation on the winding and kaluza - klein operators @xmath85 then the transformation law for the vertex  ( [ vertex ] ) is @xmath86}}=\\\\    \\nonumber & & = v^{c'}_3 \\prod_{j=0}^2 \\bigg\\ { { { \\rm e}^ { \\ii \\pi   \\left [ \\sum_{m < n}\\left ( ( \\hat{n}'_j)_m ( d { } ^tc)^{mn } ( \\hat{n}'_j)_n + ( \\hat{m}'_j)^m ( b { } ^ta)_{mn } ( \\hat{m}'_j)^n \\right ) + { } ^t\\hat{m}'_jb { } ^tc \\hat{n}'_j \\right ] } } \\bigg\\ } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in the last line we used of the conservation of windings and momenta . thus the vertex  ( [ vertex ] ) is fully symmetric under permutations of the external states , but is not invariant under the t - duality transformations  .",

    "clearly eq .",
    ", being a set of linear constraints , fixes the form of the boundary state up to an overall factor that can also depend on the kaluza - klein and winding operators .",
    "we will now show that the boundary state for a magnetised d - brane does indeed contain non - trivial phases that depend on the winding numbers and on the field @xmath31 ; moreover it turns out that this phase is strictly related to the phase that closed string states acquire under t - duality .",
    "following  @xcite , we consider the gauge field contribution to the action in the string path - integral as an interaction term that acts on the standard boundary state for an unmagnetised d - brane wrapping the @xmath6 .",
    "we want to derive the dependence of @xmath97 on the magnetic field by applying the usual path ordered wilson loop operator @xmath98 $ ] to @xmath99 .",
    "the computation was performed in  @xcite in a minkowski flat target space , while the novelty of the present calculation is the compactness of the torus wrapped by the d - branes . as the non - zero modes contribution to the boundary state",
    "is not affected by the shape of the target space , we will mostly focus on the zero - modes .",
    "of course , our aim is to determine all the @xmath31-dependent terms that can not be fixed from  .",
    "in order to do so we have to pay some care to the definition of the wilson loop operator .",
    "any gauge potential for   will involve a linear , and thus non - periodic , function .",
    "let us start from the simpler case @xmath100 , @xmath101 . as usual , we need to compensate for the non - periodicity of @xmath102 by introducing a set of gauge transformations @xmath103 .",
    "each @xmath103 encodes the gluing conditions for the gauge potential between two copies of the torus that are adjacent along the @xmath104-th direction in the covering space .",
    "so the gauge potential living on a d - branes world volume wrapping a cycle of the compactification torus must satisfy @xmath105 where @xmath106 denotes the @xmath104-th cycle of the torus . in the case under analysis , all gauge transformations @xmath103 belong to @xmath107 and so the formula above can be further simplified .",
    "we choose not to do it , so as to keep the equations   valid also for the non - abelian generalization that we will need once we reintroduce multiple wrappings .",
    "the background gauge field ( gauge bundle ) is properly defined by eq .   together with the set of @xmath103 s . in order to have a consistent bundle",
    ", the gluing matrices must satisfy the overlap condition @xmath108 all fields charged under the gauge potential have to obey periodicity conditions similar to  .",
    "for instance , fields transforming in the fundamental ( @xmath109 ) or in the adjoint ( @xmath110 ) representation must satisfy @xmath111 as a consequence of eq .",
    "( [ funperiodicity ] ) , under a generic gauge transformation @xmath112 , the gluing matrices @xmath103 transform in the following fashion @xmath113 notice that there are no restrictions on @xmath112 and in particular it does not have to be periodic .",

    "indeed the transition matrices defining the gauge bundle of a brane wrapped along a @xmath5 are related by a gauge transformation if they describe branes with the same chern class @xmath146 and the same product of the wrappings @xmath147 .",
