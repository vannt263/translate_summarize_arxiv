    "the most favourable populations to study the low - mass initial mass function ( imf ) are young , dynamically unevolved clusters , not only because they sample the entire mass spectrum but also because very - low - mass stars and brown dwarfs are intrinsically brighter at young ages .",
    "properties of interest in the observed imfs of young associations are the higher - mass slope , the mass at which the imf reaches a maximum ( turn - over mass or characteristic mass ) and the brown dwarf to star ratio .",
    "the local universe high - mass imf seems to be universal within the expected uncertainties , following a power - law with approximately the salpeter index ( e.g. , @xcite ; for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "however , at the lower mass end important differences have become apparent .    in recent years",
    ", substantial advances have been made in the study of the low - mass and substellar imf , especially in four nearby star forming regions : taurus @xcite , ic348 @xcite , chamaeleon i @xcite and the orion nebula cluster ( onc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these populations sample different star - forming environments , from taurus that represents the best studied example of star formation at low ( stellar and gas ) density to the onc that is a relatively extreme environment * ( when compared to these other associations ) * , being much denser and having a high - mass population that extends to massive o - stars .",
    "the low - mass imf for these four regions shows important variations , namely in the turn - over mass and the brown dwarf to star ratio @xcite .",
    "this suggests a dependence of the imf properties on the conditions of star formation .",
    "star formation theories by fragmentation @xcite , core ejection ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and core evaporation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) predict changes in the brown dwarf fraction and/or characteristic mass of the imf depending on local environmental conditions ( e.g. , molecular cloud density , radiation field ) . constraining any environmental dependence of the imf might help pin down which physical parameters are important in shaping it .",
    "the massive stars in the young cluster ngc6611 are responsible for the ionisation of the hii region m16 , the eagle nebula .",
    "indeed , just the 3 most massive stars in the cluster central area emit @xmath35 times more ionising radiation than the central trapezium cluster of the onc .",
    "ngc6611 cluster members are distributed over a region of @xmath314arcmin radius , with a higher concentration in the largely unobscured 4arcmin radius central area @xcite .",
    "recent distance determinations , derived using spectroscopic parallaxes @xcite and main - sequence turnoff @xcite , favour values around 1.8kpc .",
    "the cluster contains a large number of massive stars as well as a large population of pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars @xcite .",
    "the total observed mass of ngc6611 is at least a factor @xmath32 larger than that of the onc @xcite .",
    "this cluster is very young , with an age of 2@xmath03myr @xcite .",
    "a considerable age spread ( @xmath51@xmath06myr ) has been reported for sources in the eagle nebula @xcite but @xcite find no clear evidence of age gradients throughout the region .",
    "a rich low - mass ( m@xmath60.5m@xmath4 ) pms population was identified by @xcite concentrated towards the most massive ngc6611 cluster members .",
    "many of these young stars retain dusty circumstellar discs , identified by l - band excesses . for a comprehensive review on ngc6611 and the eagle nebula see @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss new hubble space telescope ( hst ) observations of the central area of ngc6611 at optical and near - ir wavelengths .",
    "these new observations are the deepest to date in this region , reaching well into the brown dwarf regime .",
    "we construct the low - mass imf from intermediate to substellar masses by combining the hst dataset with ground - based photometry from @xcite .",
    "this manuscript is organised as follows .",
    "firstly we describe the hst data and its reduction process and the photometry and its calibration .",
    "this is followed by the pms identification , reddening determinations and completeness and contamination corrections , both for the hst data and ground - based data .",
    "finally , we construct the imf for ngc6611 and compare its main features ( slope , characteristic mass and brown dwarf to star ratio ) to other well studied young clusters and associations .",
    "we discuss the implications in terms of the environmental impact on the imf and star and brown dwarf formation scenarios .",
    "the hubble space telescope images of the core of ngc6611 described here were obtained as part of the cycle 14 programme number 10533 ( p.i .",
    "oliveira ) .",
    "optical images were obtained with the wide field channel ( wfc ) of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs , * ? ? ? * ) . a single acs / wfc field was observed through the f775w and f850lp filters ( roughly corresponding to ground - based @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) . with a @xmath30.05pixel scale and two 2k@xmath94k detectors ,",
    "the wfc field - of - view is @xmath33.4@xmath93.4 .",
    "the system gain was set to 2 to completely sample the full - well - depth ( as opposed to @xmath375% for gain 1 ) , resulting in only a modest increase in readnoise and a significant increase in the dynamic range of the observations .",
    "the total exposure time per filter is 2000s , split into 4 dithered exposures of 500s .",
    "this corresponds to one hst orbit per filter .",
    "the observations were designed to probe well into the brown dwarf regime , reaching down for the first time in such a distant cluster to @xmath30.02m@xmath4 .",
    "near - infrared images were obtained with the near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) onboard hst .",
    "the camera used was nic2 with a 19.2@xmath919.2 field - of - view and 0.075pixels .",
    "we observed 25 nic2 fields to form a mosaic covering @xmath32.5arcmin@xmath10 .",
    "the nic2 field positions were chosen in such a way as to avoid the bright stars in the field ( fig.[fov ] ) .",
    "the filters used are f110w and f160w .",
    "these correspond loosely to ground - based @xmath11 and @xmath12 filters , but the reader should note that the f110w is much broader than any other commonly used j - band filters ( 0.8@xmath01.4@xmath13 m ) .",
    "the total exposure time per field per filter is 128s , split into 4 dithered exposures . to observe all 25 fields in both filters",
    "5 hst orbits were needed . the area covered by the hst observations in ngc6611",
    "is shown in fig.[fov ] .",
    "the acs reduction pipeline consists of two main stages : the first corrects for instrumental effects and produces calibrated data products including appropriate photometry keywords ( calacs ) ; the second corrects for the significant geometric distortion in wfc images , performs cosmic ray rejection and combines associated dithered data using drizzle techniques ( multidrizzle , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for our programme ,",
    "the hst pipeline results were a single astrometrically and photometrically calibrated image for each filter ( `` drz images '' in units of @xmath14s@xmath15 ) .",
    "the photometric zeropoints are 25.256 and 24.326mag respectively for @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( vegamag magnitude system , * ? ? ?",
    "point spread function ( psf ) photometry was performed on these pipeline images as described below .",
    "psf fitting packages use an optimal weighting scheme that depends on the true counts per pixel as well as readout noise and gain . to properly compute the charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) correction ( see below ) it is also necessary to have the total number of electrons instead of electron rate . therefore , before applying the photometric algorithms , the drz images were multiplied by the total exposure time and",
    "the average background sky level was added back to the images ( see extensive discussion by * ? ? ?",
    "stellar photometry was obtained using the _ daophot _ package @xcite within _",
    "pyraf_@xcite , modelling the spatially variable psf independently for each filter .",
    "standard object detection and aperture photometry algorithms were used to detect and compute preliminary magnitudes .",
    "psfs were constructed using a large number of stars well distributed across the images ( respectively 134 and 160 stars for the i- and z - bands ) .",
    "stars were chosen to be bright so that the psf in the core and wings could be well described but not brighter than @xmath318.5mag ; above this limit there are clear non - linearity effects and the psf profiles of those stars no longer match the profiles of fainter stars .",
    "an elliptical moffat function was chosen for the functional form of the analytical component of the psf model and this model was allowed to vary quadratically with position in the image .",
    "once appropriate psf models were computed , the _ allstar _",
    "function was used to compute photometry for all the stars in the frame ; approximately 16000 objects have measured psf photometry in each frame . as can be seen in fig.[fov ] ,",
    "the acs images contain a number of bright stars that saturate the exposures and cause leakage artifacts .",
    "these artifacts cause a large number of spurious detections distributed mostly in halos around the bright stars and on spikes along affected columns and/or rows .",
    "the psf photometry output files contain two output parameters that together with the magnitude error can be used to filter out spurious detections .",
    "the sharpness parameter estimates the intrinsic angular size of the object : stellar objects should have a value around zero ( with a larger scatter for fainter magnitudes ) , while large negative and positive values identify respectively cosmic rays and other blemishes and resolved galaxies and blended objects .",
    "the @xmath16 parameter measures the goodness - of - the - fit and should be around unity with no noticeable trend with magnitude . as mentioned above , bright but unsaturated stars",
    "are affected by non - linearity effects so the measured @xmath16 is somewhat larger for these objects .",
    "a very good description on how imposing cuts to these parameters is used to eliminate spurious detections in catalogues can be found in @xcite .",
    "the photometric errors , sharpness and @xmath16 parameters were thus used to refine each photometry catalogue and then the @xmath7 and @xmath8 detections were cross - correlated . as both filters were observed in the same visit the positional drifts between the images are negligible , so the catalogues were matched in x and y pixel positions before astrometry was performed : 3462 objects were detected in the combined @xmath17 catalogue .",
    "the acs ccd detectors suffer from scattered light at long wavelengths ( from about 7500 ) and the fraction of integrated light in the scattered light halo increases as a function of wavelength .",
    "the amount of light contained in the halo will also be larger the redder the stellar source , i.e.  the shape of the observed psf depends on the colour of the star , something that psf fitting algorithms can not account for .",
    "the best way to mitigate for this is to compute colour - dependent aperture corrections .",
    "therefore , we were only able to calibrate in this way objects that are detected in both the i- and z - band filters . the halo effect and the prescription on how to correct for it are described in detail in @xcite and we provide here only a summary",
    ".    a useful quantity to help estimate colour - dependent aperture corrections is the effective wavelength @xmath18 that represents the mean wavelength of the detected photons .",
    "this source - dependent passband parameter can be used to quantify changes in the stellar light encircled in a radius @xmath19 as a function of the stellar colour . once @xmath18 is determined for each source and each filter",
    ", @xcite provides a tabulated relation between @xmath18 and aperture correction for several aperture radii .    to define a relation between @xmath18 and observable instrumental colour we used the function _",
    "calcphot _ in _ synphot _ @xcite and a large number of stellar template spectra .",
    "we used the following spectral atlases : the bruzual - persson - gunn - stryker atlas available within _ synphot _ ( spectral types to early m ) and the atlas of m , l and t type dwarfs compiled by sandy leggett with spectra from several authors @xcite . in total over 300 spectra were used from early - type stars to t - dwarfs . with _ calcphot _",
    ", we computed instrumental @xmath20 colours , @xmath21 and @xmath22 to construct a linear relation equivalent to that shown in fig.11 of @xcite . for the objects in our combined @xmath17 catalogue , we measured their instrumental colour , interpolated to estimate @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and interpolated sirianni s table6 to obtain colour - dependent aperture corrections .",
    "computed aperture corrections are in the ranges 0.22@xmath00.25mag and 0.42@xmath00.55mag , respectively for @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "another effect that needs to be corrected for is the position- and time - dependent decrease in the ccd s charge transfer efficiency ( cte , * ? ? ?",
    "a photometric correction can be applied that depends on the stellar flux and sky levels , on the y position in the chip and on the time interval since the start of acs operations . using the prescription and coefficients described in @xcite we computed magnitude corrections of up to 0.05mag and 0.08mag respectively for @xmath7 and @xmath8 .    once all these photometric corrections were applied",
    ", astrometry was performed using the _ iraf _ task _ xy2rd_. astrometry was performed individually in the @xmath7 and @xmath8 images and the positions were averaged .",
    "no absolute astrometry was performed at this stage .",
    "the final @xmath17 catalogue reaches down to @xmath23mag and @xmath24mag , with photometric errors @xmath30.12mag and @xmath30.08mag respectively .",
    "the nicmos pipeline consists of two main stages : the first corrects for instrumental effects ( calnica ) and the second combines images obtained in a dither pattern and subtracts the sky background from the images ( calnicb ) . due to the way in which the observations were designed , the pipeline combines the 4 dithered exposures for each field but it does not combine the 25 fields in a single mosaic . crucially the pipeline does not correct for the geometric distortion , the largest component of that distortion being a large difference in the x and y platescales . the best way to correct for these distortions and simultaneously construct complete mosaics for each of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 filters is to use the routine _ multidrizzle _ in _ pyraf _ on the output frames from the calnica step , i.e on the 25@xmath94 images per filter .",
    "this routine works in a very similar way to the second pipeline step for the acs images .",
    "mosaics were constructed for @xmath11 and @xmath12 with a final pixel scale of 0.05 , that conveniently matches the wfc pixel scale .",
    "before the images were mosaiced they were corrected for the nicmos count - rate- and wavelength - dependent non - linearity @xcite .",
    "this correction is not applied by the pipeline reduction process but a separate _ python _ routine is available .",
    "the non - linearity correction amounts to 0.063mag offset per dex change in incident flux for @xmath11 and 0.029mag per dex in @xmath12 .",
    "the routine changes the count rates in the output images and therefore new zero - points are needed : 24.561 and 23.863mag respectively for @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( vegamag magnitude ) for images in units of @xmath14s@xmath15 .",
    "we initially attempted to perform psf photometry on the @xmath11 and @xmath12 images as well .",
    "however , nic2 undersamples the psf at these wavelengths and the psf profile is rather complex @xcite ; as a result we found that the quality of the psf fits was not good , particularly for the h - band . as our images are not crowded , we opted to use aperture photometry instead .",
    "approximately 5000 and 10000 sources were detected in @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively ; a large number of these are spurious detections ( e.g. , artifacts near bright stars and at the edge of individual frames etc ) that can be removed by combining these catalogues with the @xmath17 catalogue .",
    "aperture corrections were computed using 60@xmath080 unsaturated bright stars .",
    "astrometry was performed on the @xmath11 and @xmath12 catalogues as described above for the acs images .",
    "possible deficiencies in using aperture photometry are corrected for with a careful computation of completeness corrections described in section3.1.3 .      to complement our hst catalogue at the brighter end ( the hst images saturate for pms objects of just over a solar mass )",
    ", we used the optical and ir catalogue described in @xcite , that covers a much larger area in the central region of ngc6611 . for a complete description of the observations and data reduction",
    "the reader should refer to that article .",
    "their catalogue includes i and z cousins magnitudes and @xmath25 photometry in the mko - ir system @xcite .    as noted above the hst filters",
    "are very different from groundbased filter sets and it is not trivial to convert between those systems as significant colour terms are expected ( especially for cool pms objects ) due to the very different filter bandwidths . even though there are a number of objects observed in both hst and groundbased filter sets , these are few and crucially they are at the bright / blue end of the hst data and",
    "therefore the colour range is not sufficient to derive reliable magnitude conversions .",
    "furthermore we have to use two different sets of pms isochrones , as no single set covers the whole mass range we are addressing in this manuscript , from several solar masses down to the substellar regime .",
    "therefore we have made no attempt to merge these two photometric catalogues .",
    "the groundbased catalogue reaches down to @xmath30.5m@xmath4 and thus provides a good overlap in pms stellar masses with the hst catalogue .",
    "as described below we construct cluster imfs over different mass ranges ( over the same area and using methods that are similar whenever possible ) and combine them for the total imf analysis .",
    "the @xmath17 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 hst catalogues were combined based on their astrometry . as can be seen in fig.[fov ] the @xmath11 and @xmath12 images cover roughly a quarter of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 images . in the overlapping region",
    "729 objects have @xmath1 photometry  @xmath7 band magnitudes are the limiting ones .",
    "this is the hst catalogue from which pre - main - sequence stars are going to be selected based on several colour - magnitude diagrams ( fig.[hst_cmds ] ) .",
    "fig.[hst_cmds ] shows the colour - magnitude diagrams used to identify the pre - main - sequence ( pms ) population in ngc6611 .",
    "these young stars are cooler than field stars of the same apparent magnitude and thus can be easily identified in such diagrams .",
    "selection criteria are shown in the figure , based on the observed @xmath7 magnitude and @xmath20 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 colours and the position of theoretical isochrones @xcite . using these criteria",
    "290 stars are identified as pms candidates and as such , candidate low - mass members of ngc6611 ( table[table1 ] , complete in electronic form only ) . * a census of circumstellar discs exists for the _",
    "brighter part _ of this sample ( @xmath2819mag , @xcite ; see also @xcite ) but we do not take this information into account in order not to bias our sample selection in any way .",
    "furthermore , no disc survey exists for the larger , fainter part of our sample .",
    "*    we also show in the figure two populations of spectroscopically confirmed young very low - mass stars and brown - dwarfs , with ages that nicely bracket the age of the pms population in ngc6611 and that have been observed with the same filters : taurus ( 1@xmath02myr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and upper scorpius ( @xmath35myr ; * ? ? ?",
    "the position of these objects in the diagram shows that our selection region is generous enough to include a pms population of age @xmath55myr ; our selection therefore should not exclude any pms objects .",
    "the foreground loci in the colour - magnitude diagrams are sparsely populated so contamination by foreground dwarfs is not large ; this was expected since the area we are analysing is relatively small .",
    "the cuts shown in the figure , in particular the cut in @xmath27 colour , are also very effective in separating the pms population from the large number of heavily reddened stars towards the galactic centre .",
    "these stars delineate a well - defined sequence with @xmath20 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 colours in the narrow ranges 2@xmath03 , 4.5@xmath06 and 2@xmath02.5mag respectively .",
    "our hst survey is so deep that in order to understand the nature of this heavily reddened population we need to consider what lies behind the cluster towards the galactic centre .",
    "the line - of - sight towards the eagle nebula encounters the scutum - crux spiral arm at a distance of @xmath54kpc @xcite .",
    "recent three - dimensional galactic insterstellar extinction maps show that behind ngc6611 there is a marked extinction jump consistent with the location of this spiral arm : between 2.8@xmath03.5kpc from the sun , extinction as measured by @xmath29 increases from @xmath30.6 to @xmath31.4mag .",
    "this suggests that the distinct clump of reddened stars could be part of the scutum - crux spiral arm structure .",
    "to test this hypothesis we use evolutionary tracks from @xcite for a 5gyr - old population and solar metallicity , computed for the hst acs and nicmos filter sets .",
    "two such tracks are shown in fig.[hst_cmds ] : the bluest for a distance of 2500kpc and @xmath30=13mag and the reddest for 3500kpc and @xmath30=17mag .",
    "these tracks encompass the observed population very well .",
    "therefore , even though the distance and extinction estimates are very approximate , the population with redder colours is entirely consistent with what we would expect for a population in that spiral arm , at a range of distances and extinctions consistent with the 2mass extinction profile .",
    "this population , that would include both main - sequence and evolved stars , seems to be an important source of contamination .",
    "however , fig.[hst_cmds ] shows that these stars are so much redder than genuine cluster members that they are effectively excluded by the @xmath27 cut we apply for pms selection .",
    "other sources of contamination are discussed further in section3.1.4 .      the first step to analyse a pms population in a region like",
    "ngc6611 is to determine intrinsic magnitudes , i.e to correct for reddening .",
    "many authors have studied the extinction properties towards the eagle nebula ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the optical extinction ( @xmath30 ) is variable and the values of @xmath31 ( the ratio of total to selective extinction ) , estimated on a star by star basis , are larger than the normal interstellar medium value",
    ". reported @xmath31 values are in the range 3.5@xmath04.8 ( typical value @xmath33.75 , @xcite ) while @xmath32 values vary between 0.5@xmath01.1mag . towards",
    "the ngc6611 cluster extinction is however at the lower end of this range @xcite .",
    "the way in which we designed the nicmos observations ( i.e. avoiding the bright stars ) means that we do not have independent extinction determinations towards the survey area .",
    "however , as can be seen from fig.[reddening ] , that area is surrounded by many stars with reddening measurements .",
    "thus a typical @xmath32 towards the survey area is of the order of 0.70mag with an observed spread of @xmath30.45@xmath01.0mag , corresponding to @xmath33mag and a range of @xmath31.7@xmath03.75mag  we adopt @xmath34 for cluster members .",
    "thus , extinction is relatively low in the central cluster area but it is also variable even at small spatial scales .",
    "accordingly we have opted to compute extinction towards individual pms candidates using the two colour - colour diagrams shown in fig.[hst_ccd ] .",
    "also shown are the @xcite pms isochrones ( these authors have produced absolute magnitudes for the 4 hst filters used in this analysis ) . using the stellar spectral atlas and procedure described previously , we compute hst colours for a large number of dwarfs in order to construct a dwarf locus down to spectral type m8@xmath0m9 . reddening vectors are computed using the same template spectra and the reddening curve of @xcite adopting @xmath353.75 : the spectra are reddened with a range of @xmath32 values and _ synphot _ is used to estimate the extincted colours through the hst filters .",
    "the resulting reddening slopes are @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "pms stars have lower surface gravities than main - sequence dwarf stars , and thus populate colour - colour diagrams in the region between dwarfs and giants ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as can be seen from fig.[hst_ccd ]",
    "there are sizable differences between the isochrones and the determined dwarf loci .",
    "we did not have many late - m dwarf spectra available to constrain the reddest loci colours , and we do not see evidence in our dataset of the sharp turn to redder @xmath27 colours that seems to occur for these spectral types : the variation of the @xmath27 colour for m - dwarfs is @xmath30.4mag , while for our pms candidates the observed @xmath27 spread is @xmath30.3mag , even with possible variable extinction effects .",
    "we have therefore decided to de - redden the pms candidates using the set of pms isochrones that are being used for the mass determination @xcite .",
    "fig.[hst_ccd ] shows that the baraffe isochrones in the colour - colour diagrams are somewhat age - dependent .",
    "the dependence is small and only affects stars in a small range of observed colours .",
    "nevertheless , we adopt two values for the age of ngc6611 , 2 and 3myr , consistent with the higher mass population @xcite",
    ". we will keep these calculations completely independent , i.e we obtain independent imfs for these two assumed ages in order to isolate the effect of fixing the age of the population .    using the reddening vector and the isochrones ,",
    "@xmath32 is computed for each star in each diagram ; when available the two estimated @xmath32 values are averaged .",
    "error bars are computed for these estimates , including contributions from photometric errors in the observed colours and the uncertainty introduced by the choice of the reddening vector  the reddening vector slope changes somewhat depending on the spectral energy distribution of the star , see previous discussion on @xmath18 .",
    "a feature in these diagrams are the 32 stars that can not be de - reddened because they do not have a reddening vector intersection with the isochrones .",
    "three of these objects are too red for the available theoretical colours .",
    "the remaining 29 objects have observed @xmath27 colours that seem too red for their observed @xmath26 and @xmath20 colours and thus can not be de - reddened onto the pms loci .",
    "closer inspection of fig.[hst_ccd ] suggests that the majority of those stars would be too reddened to be considered bona - fide cluster members .",
    "these stars are relatively bright thus _ if they were ngc6611 members _ they should have an intrinsic pms @xmath400.9mag .",
    "if we de - redden these objects using only their @xmath27 colour to a conservative intrinsic colour of @xmath410.9mag , the estimated @xmath32 for most objects would be in the range 1.0@xmath01.7mag with only three objects having @xmath42mag .",
    "therefore of these 29 objects all but 3 would be rejected for having reddening too large when compared to the reddening distribution of more reliable cluster members ( see fig.[ebv ] and discussion on reddening cuts below ) .",
    "it is likely that these objects are actually behind the cluster and not pms objects .",
    "some earlier type stars fall in the region of the diagrams where the de - reddening procedure has two solutions . for these stars we computed two extinction solutions , i.e.  one to the``late - type branch '' ( with @xmath43mag ) and one to the `` early - type branch '' ( with @xmath44mag ) .",
    "we find that the @xmath32 values determined to the `` late - type branch '' are consistent with the @xmath32 cluster distribution ( fig.[ebv ] ) .",
    "we note that the extinction determinations for these objects have larger error bars reflecting the uncertainties of the procedure .",
    "fig.[ebv ] shows the histograms of @xmath32 values determined towards pms candidates .",
    "the mean of the distribution is consistent with the average @xmath32 measured towards massive cluster members ( fig.[reddening ] ) .",
    "its standard deviation is of the order of 0.15mag ; when compared to the typical @xmath32 error of 0.07mag this again suggests that local variations of extinction are real , as can be seen from the images themselves and fig.[reddening ] .",
    "the range of @xmath32 values in fig.[ebv ] ( @xmath45mag ) is larger than the range measured towards massive cluster members ( @xmath46mag ) , suggesting that the pms candidate sample includes some foreground and background contaminants .",
    "we use these histograms to refine cluster membership : objects that have @xmath32 values in the range 0.45@xmath01.0mag ( the same as the massive cluster members ) are kept in the pms sample .",
    "our survey is so deep that reddened stars behind the cluster can contaminate the pms selection ( section3.1.1 ) .",
    "the upper reddening cut is essential to exclude as many of those objects as possible ( see section3.1.4 ) ; the lower cut eliminates some foreground dwarfs .",
    "we note that , so long as reddening is not mass dependent and the intrinsic loci and reddening vectors are not in error in a mass - dependent way , then reddening cuts should not affect the derived shape of the imf , even if they were too stringent .",

    "then assuming either an age of 2 or 3myr and adopting a distance of 1.8kpc , masses are computed for each object using their intrinsic i - band magnitudes and the @xcite isochrones .",
    "for this sample , estimated masses range from 0.02 to 1.5@xmath48 ( table[table1 ] ) . in the next sections we deal with two crucial issues in imf analysis : completeness and contamination .",
    "many bright stars are saturated in the hst images and create image artifacts that can prevent the detection of fainter stars nearby .",
    "we also need to characterise the reduced detection sensitivity at the fainter end . in order to address the issue of completeness of the photometric catalogues we construct fake star simulations : replicas of pms stars",
    "( i.e. stars with true pms magnitudes in @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) , randomly selected from the observed i - band luminosity function , are introduced into the 4 hst images , at random positions . for simplicity in generating the randomised star positions ,",
    "this experiment was performed in the central 1.2arcmin@xmath49 area of the survey .",
    "one hundred sets of fake stars were created , each with 100 randomly selected pms replicas . in each simulation the number of objects in the central region was increased by about @xmath50 , thus not changing the crowding properties of the field in any significant way .    in order to introduce the replica pms stars in the images we use the psfs determined for each filter and the _ addstar _ procedure in _ iraf_. as described in section2.3 , for the j and h band we computed psfs for the mosaics but ultimately opted to use aperture photometry in the final catalogue .",
    "we tested the procedure of adding stars to the mosaics using the computed psfs and then performing aperture photometry on those stars and it works well : stars are recovered at a similar rate as for the i and z images and their magnitudes are preserved .",
    "the complete data reduction procedure , exactly as described in the previous sections , was repeated for each of the 100 simulations , including ( psf or aperture ) photometry , aperture and linearity corrections , astrometry , catalogue matching etc and pms selection .",
    "finally the input and recovered i - band luminosity functions are compared : of the 10000 stars simulated 9301 were recovered .",
    "the recovered stars are not only detected in @xmath51 and @xmath12 but they also have colours consistent with pms selection , i.e. of the pms stars simulated approximately 93% are recovered _ and selected as pms objects_. this is what we mean by `` recovery rate '' .",
    "fig.[completeness ] shows the recovery rate as a function of i - band magnitude , as well as the histograms for the simulated and recovered i - band magnitudes .",

    "the intrinsic i - band magnitudes of stars with spectral types from a0 to m9 were compiled from several sources in the literature @xcite while average colours were derived for the hst filters in a section3.1.2 .",
    "we then populated a cone of length 7200pc in the direction of ngc6611 according to the density behaviour described above , selecting stars randomly from the list previously generated .",
    "the opening angle of the cone simulates an area ten times larger than our real survey area to ensure that the contamination correction plays no role in the statistical uncertainties of the imf .",
    "the next step is to describe the extinction profile towards and _ behind _ ngc6611 .",
    "@xcite shows that the reddening distribution of field stars towards the cluster has two peaks , one identified as a low - extinction foreground population and a second identified as a reddened background population obscured by the molecular cloud .",
    "the @xmath32 values measured towards both the massive cluster members and pms stars seem to show a real spread in extinction .",
    "this suggests a first extinction screen associated with the cluster s parent molecular cloud .",
    "the analysis in section3.1.1 strongly suggests that there is a second extinction screen behind the cluster , probably associated with another spiral arm structure .",
    "we take all this information into account to construct a prescription for the behaviour of extinction as a function of distance along the line - of - sight towards ngc6611 .",
    "we assumed that @xmath32 has a double - step - like behaviour : it grows linearly with distance at the rate of 0.25magkpc@xmath15 , reaching @xmath691.7mag at the cluster position and then immediately increasing to @xmath703.7mag ( in agreement with measurements towards cluster members ) . behind the cluster",
    ", extinction continues to increase at 0.25magkpc@xmath15 until the position of the second extinction screen . at a distance of 2500pc extinction",
    "climbs to @xmath7113mag , consistent with the 2mass extinction profile from @xcite .",
    "after that , extinction increases linearly to a maximum simulated distance of 7200pc .",
    "we adopt @xmath34mag up to and including the cluster position ( the extinction behaviour is dominated by the average dust properties _ in the molecular cloud _ ) , while behind the cluster we adopt @xmath72 , more consistent with the average properties of the galactic interstellar medium ( ism ) . each star in the simulation",
    "has extinction applied to its magnitudes according to its simulated distance and following this two - step function . finally , the simulated apparent magnitudes are perturbed according to the observed distribution of measurement errors in the photometric catalogue .",
    "fig.[contamination ] shows a colour - magnitude diagram : filled and open circles represent the observed and simulated catalogues respectively .",
    "the simulated catalogue seems to successfully reproduce the observed colour - colour and colour - magnitude diagrams in terms of the different stellar populations present : the foreground population , the moderate extinction background population and the heavily reddened population at larger distance behind the cluster . to test whether the simulated catalogue also quantitatively produces the correct numbers of stars we investigated in more detail two particular regions in the @xmath17 diagram : just below the pms selection area and the region where the clump of stars with redder colours are observed .",
    "the comparison of the numbers of simulated and observed stars in colour bins is also shown in fig.[contamination ] .",
    "for these two representative regions , the simulated catalogue produces stellar numbers that are entirely consistent with the observed catalogue .",
    "however , the simulated catalogue does not produce stars with more extreme red colours ( @xmath73mag ) .",
    "there are several possible reasons for this .",
    "the properties of the very reddened population are sensitive to the details of the extinction profile in the simulation , such as the location and magnitude of the second extinction jump , the fact that we do not account for any structure or clumpiness in the ism and the adopted reddening coefficients . and at large extinctions , these coefficients are manifestly not constant and they also depend on the intrinsic colours of each object .",
    "furthermore , we only simulate main - sequence objects ; this reddened population has evolved stars associated with it , brighter and redder objects that we simply do not simulate .",
    "the properties of the first extinction jump affect only the population underneath the pms selection region .",
    "another source of uncertainty is the parameters associated with the galactic stellar density distribution , particularly @xmath74 @xcite .    in spite of all these caveats ,",
    "our simulation is able to reproduce the observed catalogue quite well .",
    "fig.[contamination ] shows that the number of possible contaminants ( i.e. simulated objects that fall into the pms selection region ) is very small , even for such a deep survey .",
    "the heavily extincted background population is effectively removed by the @xmath27 colour cut for pms selection ( fig.[hst_cmds ] ) . by using reddening cuts ( see section3.1.2 ) we are further able to exclude the majority of possible contaminants from the foreground and moderately extincted background populations .",
    "the application of the reddening cuts also means that the exact details of the extinction behind the cluster are not crucial ; as the area considered here is small , the number of foreground contaminants is so small that foreground extinction is also not an issue .",
    "however , some objects from the former population can have similar extinction as the young cluster , and thus contaminate the pms selection region .",
    "these contaminants need to be taken into account when constructing the mass function .",
    "the procedure described here to mimic field star contamination produces a catalogue that is processed in exactly the same way as the observed stellar catalogue .",
    "a pms and reddening selection is performed on the simulated catalogue : there are only 52 simulated contaminants in the pms selection region and of these only 17 or 14 fulfil the reddening requirements ( respectively using the 2 or 3 myr isochrones ) . for these objects , intrinsic i - band magnitudes and stellar masses",
    "are estimated .",
    "the derived masses are used to compute a contamination mass function ( mf ) .",
    "this mf is divided by 10 because the simulated area is ten times larger than our actual survey .",
    "we find that there are _ less than 2 contaminants in the two lower mass bins_. even though contamination is low , we choose not to neglect it as it affects the more crucial lower - mass bins .",
    "the contamination mf is subtracted from the completeness - corrected imf computed in the previous section ( section4.1 ) .",
    "we consider other potential sources of contamination .",
    "nearby giants are very bright and thus are saturated in the hst images .",
    "giants associated with the heavily extincted population described above are not simulated .",
    "however , as it can be seen in fig.[hst_cmds ] , they are redder than @xmath75mag and thus do not contaminate the pms selection region . evolved stars between the cluster and this redder population could in principle contaminate the pms selection ; they are however in negligible numbers due to the low stellar density and the small volume sampled .",
    "the reddening screen behind the cluster further precludes giants nearer the galactic centre as well as bright galaxies from being pms contaminants , by making these extremely red and faint .",
    "we selected from the @xmath1 catalogue of @xcite a subset of stars from the same area in the sky as the nicmos mosaic in fig.[fov ] .",
    "no attempt was made to convert photometry from different filter systems to merge the catalogues .",
    "this subset contains 176 objects from which we select pms candidates based on colour - magnitude diagrams .",

    "this analysis confirms that the shape of the imf of ngc6611 more resembles that of taurus and it is very unlikely to mirror that of the onc .",
    "we can also compare the relative numbers of stars and brown dwarfs for these clusters .",
    "we should point out that such ratios are problematic to compute as it is difficult to achieve survey completeness : for instance taurus is a very spatially extended region and @xcite claim that current ic348 surveys are still incomplete .",
    "we list available ratios for the 6 clusters in table[clusters ] .",
    "the brown dwarf to star ratio varies from 0.13 for ic348 to 0.30 for the onc and ngc2024 .",
    "the brown dwarf to star ratios of the onc , ngc2024 and chamaeleoni are similar within the uncertainties while those for taurus and ic348 are lower .",

    "we use cluster data available in the literature to crudely estimate an average stellar surface density of pms stars ( dividing the number of stars with masses in the range 0.03@xmath01m@xmath4 by the area ) for each cluster .",

    "the average ionising fluxes for ngc6611 and the onc are similar , despite the fact that ngc6611 has more and more powerful ionising sources .",
    "ngc6611 is the most massive of the clusters considered here @xcite .",
    "the imfs of the onc , chamaeleoni and ic348 are similar , despite their different stellar densities ; although compared to these other clusters ic348 has an abnormally low number of brown dwarfs .",

    "the imfs of ngc6611 and the onc are very different , despite both being examples of low - mass star formation accompanied by o- and b - type stars .",
    "the properties described in the table[clusters ] are _ present day cluster properties _ and the ages of the clusters span 1@xmath03myr .",
    "some dynamical evolution has probably occurred so the populations were likely denser and , in the cases of ngc6611 and the onc , the pms stars were likely nearer to the ionising sources .",
    "we only analyse a small central region of ngc6611 and it is not possible to assess at the moment whether the imf we constructed is representative of the whole cluster .",
    "still , no clear trend has emerged so far that relates imf observed properties with known cluster properties like ionising radiation or stellar density .",
    "our results suggest that the radiation field from the o - stars does not play a dominant role in shaping the lower - mass imf .",
    "the goal of this paper was to investigate the properties of the low - mass imf of ngc6611 , and in particular the brown dwarf frequency and peak or characteristic mass .",
    "the intrinsic complexity of the imf and the still limited understanding of which processes are dominant in shaping it @xcite means that it is not possible to model an individual imf ( except by using analytic parameterisations like the ones described in section4.2 ) . instead by comparing the imfs of clusters and associations with different present - day properties we can try to constrain which physical conditions and",
    "eventually which physical process are more important .",
    "as recently reviewed by @xcite , there are three main types of star formation theory : fragmentation ( both gravitational and turbulent ) , competitive accretion and interruption ( that includes both ejection and photo - evaporation scenarios ) .",
    "these theories need to be able to explain not only the properties of the imf , but the binary and circumstellar disc fractions across all masses and the dynamical properties of stellar populations .",
    "there is abundant observational evidence that supports a similar formation mechanism for brown dwarfs and solar - mass stars @xcite .",
    "however , an open question in the understanding of brown dwarf ( and low - mass star ) formation is how the low - mass cores are stopped from accreting further so that their final mass can remain sub - stellar .",
    "two mechanisms have been proposed to halt accretion : ejection of newly formed fragments and photo - evaporation of collapsing cores .",
    "the ejection scenario ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) proposes that the smallest clumps in multiple systems are ejected and are thus denied access to the molecular gas reservoir .",
    "there are several problems with this scenario , namely that the spatial distribution of solar - mass stars and brown dwarfs in clusters seems to be similar @xcite , and that both the binary @xcite and disc properties @xcite of the two populations are also similar .",
    "the photo - evaporation scenario @xcite relies on the proximity to massive o - stars to stop accretion .",
    "this would imply that we should find a higher brown dwarf to star ratio in ob associations than in quieter regions ; this is not supported by our observations in ngc6611 .",
    "recently @xcite suggested that gravitational fragmentation of infalling gas into stellar clusters can form low - mass stars and brown dwarfs without invoking any additional mechanism .",
    "increased gas density within the collapse region gives rise to a filamentary - like structure within which the jeans mass is lower , allowing lower - mass clumps to form ; the infall velocity of the gas prevents the low - mass clump from accreting significant amounts of gas , preserving its low - mass or brown dwarf status . another mechanism like turbulent fragmentation would however be necessary to form brown dwarfs in low - density regions @xcite . as discussed in the previous section , the observations do not suggest any variation of brown dwarf fraction with _",
    "present day _",
    "average stellar density .",
    "the fact that massive star feedback does not seem to have a significant impact on _ low mass star formation _ is not necessarily surprising .",
    "the idea that competitive accretion in a cluster environment is an important process in the formation of the more massive stars is gaining favour @xcite . in this context",
    ", fragmentation produces lower - mass stars and a few higher - mass stars form subsequently by accreting more mass in the cluster gravitational potential .",
    "this would imply that by the time the most massive stars are formed , the main properties of the imf are already defined @xcite ; we would then not expect _ significant _ differences between the imfs of ob associations and quiet star forming regions , consistent with what was shown in section4.3 .",
    "the shape of the imf between 0.1 and 1m@xmath4 also presents a challenge .",
    "the characteristic mass of the imf @xmath128 is observed to be essentially constant for most star forming regions ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "based on numerical simulations it has been proposed that this characteristic mass ( and the associated plateau ) is related to the thermal jeans mass at the onset of ( isothermal ) collapse ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "one could then intuitively expect the plateau properties to vary with the environmental conditions , via for instance the dependence of the jeans mass on the density in the molecular core .",
    "however , @xcite show that , if grain - gas coupling is taken into account , the thermal jeans mass depends only weakly on environmental factors like density , temperature , metallicity and radiation field .",
    "indeed , recent simulations by @xcite , using a more realistic equation of state to allow for the coupling of the gas and dust at the high densities typical of star forming regions , predict a characteristic mass that is relatively independent of the initial conditions for star formation .    fig.[imfs_clusters ] shows some significant differences in the observed imfs of young clusters . at the present , and in the absence of any trend of imf properties with cluster properties , we remain unable to explain such differences .",
    "it is possible that the lower - mass imf is shaped by a combination of different processes and that a particular effect might become dominant depending on the environmental conditions .",
    "we present results based on the deepest images to date in the central region of ngc6611 .",
    "the observations were obtained with acs / wfc and nicmos on board hst and reach down to @xmath129mag .",
    "we use this photometric catalogue to construct the cluster imf from 1.5m@xmath4 to 0.02m@xmath4 .",
    "we use the photometric catalogue from @xcite to extend this imf to higher masses ( @xmath37m@xmath4 ) .",
    "we find that the imf of ngc6611 is well described by a log - normal distribution .",
    "however , both when compared to the @xcite multiple power - law and @xcite log - normal distributions , the imf of ngc6611 seems to peak at higher masses than the galactic field and the solar neighbourhood imf .",
    "the higher - mass slope is salpeter - like and we find no evidence of a sharp decline towards the brown dwarf regime .",
    "we identified 30@xmath035 brown dwarf candidates , depending on the assumed cluster age .",
    "we compare the imf we derive for ngc6611 to those of other clusters available in the literature .",
    "we find conclusive evidence that the imf of ngc6611 more closely resembles that of taurus than that of the onc .",
    "this is surprising since taurus is the prototypical low - density star - forming region while both ngc6611 and the onc are examples of low - mass star formation in ob associations .",
    "even though the present day properties of these two clusters ( stellar density and ionising radiation field ) are similar , a k - s test shows that their observed imfs are not drawn from the same mass distribution .",
    "our analysis yields no trend that relates either present - day stellar density or intensity of the ionisation field with observed imf properties .",
    "still , the fact that the imfs of taurus and ngc6611 are similar suggests that the formation of lower - mass stars can be unaffected by their massive siblings .",
    "even though there is mounting evidence that suggests variations in the lower - mass imf for young clusters , we are still at present unable to fully explain them .",
    "a large sample of clusters , observed and analysed consistently , is necessary to try to investigate environmental links in any detail .",
    "new instrumentation is already allowing us to investigate the lower - mass imfs in extragalactic environments . in that context",
    "imfs constructed solely on the basis of photometric catalogues will become increasingly important , as they offer the only reliable comparisons with extragalactic determinations .",
