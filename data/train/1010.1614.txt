    "cool white dwarfs are among the oldest stars in the galaxy .",
    "being gyrs old these stellar remnants are of importance for dating old stellar populations and understanding their star formation history .",
    "we are interested in understanding the physical properties of the atmospheres and the spectra of cool white dwarfs . over the last years we have introduced several improvements in the physics of dense media in our atmosphere models , including the radiative transfer in the refractive atmosphere , the non - ideal chemical equilibrium abundances of spectroscopically important species and the opacity of dense helium .",
    "identification of the missing absorption mechanism at short wavelengths in the models of hydrogen - rich atmospheres as the ly-@xmath3 red wing opacity as well as better description of helium - rich atmospheres have a significant impact on our understanding of cool white dwarfs .",
    "these improvements dramatically change the predicted flux at short wavelengths ( especially in the johnson u and b , and sdss u and g filters ) .",
    "the hydrogen atmosphere models follow the observed sequence of cool white dwarfs on various color - color diagrams ( fig .",
    "the best fits to the spectral energy distributions of the individual stars with @xmath4 have been obtained with hydrogen - rich models .",
    "this suggest that most of the cool stars possess hydrogen - rich atmospheres , which challenges the current picture of the spectral evolution of cool white dwarfs .    in order to investigate the chemical evolution of white dwarf",
    "atmospheres the more extreme , fluid - like atmospheres of helium - rich stars have to be better understood .",
    "the atmospheres of these stars have extreme pressures and densities of a few @xmath5 and can not be described by ideal gas laws but must rather be treated as a helium - rich fluid in which the strong inter - particle interactions determine its physics and chemistry .",
    "the conditions prevailing at the surfaces of the helium - rich atmosphere stars could be diagnosed with trace species such as @xmath6 and @xmath2 , through the impact of dense fluid on their absorption and the resulting white dwarf spectra .",
    "using modern methods we compute the properties of these species in dense helium .",
    "the resulted high - pressure - induced spectral distortions are then matched with absorption signatures observed in the spectra of helium - rich stars ( like distorted swan bands in dqp stars ) to derive the atmospheric parameters of the stars .",
    "with a grid of improved atmosphere models we have analyzed large samples of cool white dwarfs .",
    "the colors of the new models are compared to a large sdss sample in figure [ f1 ] .",
    "the new pure - h models not only reproduce the observed sequence of white dwarfs better than previous models but also show the need to include extreme line broadening of ly-@xmath3 to characterize white dwarfs with @xmath4 when the short wavelength filters are used ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "we also fitted the individual seds of a large sample of cool white dwarfs .",
    "we found that most of the stars we fitted have pure - h atmospheres , with several having mixed h / he atmospheres dominated by h. most of the stars previously identified as having pure - he atmospheres @xcite turn out to be hydrogen - rich stars in our analysis @xcite .",
    "two examples of such fits are given in figure [ f2 ] .",
    "we also observe that the amount of helium in mixed stars seems to decrease with the decrease in the effective temperature and the coolest stars ( @xmath8 ) possess pure - h atmospheres .",
    "the interpretation of these results requires further investigation and new , targeted observations to further validate the models .",
    "the dependence of the derived atmospheric parameters on the atmosphere models used in the investigation is also evident for the low - mass , he - core white dwarfs .",
    "these under - massive white dwarfs evolve through mass transfer in binary systems .",
    "one of the best known such system is a cool white dwarf orbiting the millisecond pulsar psr j0437 - 4715 . using the atmosphere models of @xcite the white dwarf",
    "was assigned a helium - rich atmosphere @xcite , which is at odds with the evolutionary models of such stars .",
    "we fitted the entire spectral energy distribution of the star , including hst uv , optical , near- and mid - infrared spectra with our models .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ f3 ] .",
    "an excellent fit is obtained with a pure - h atmosphere model with @xmath9 .",
    "the presence of hydrogen is indicated by the flux suppression in the uv because the ly-@xmath3 opacity and near - ir because of cia opacity from molecular hydrogen @xcite , comparing with the fit by the pure - he atmosphere model .",
    "_ ab initio _ methods represent a novel approach to the modeling of the properties of fluid - like stellar atmospheres . in combination with the methods of the classical theory of fluids they are a powerful tool for predicting the thermodynamical , optical and chemical properties of cool white dwarf atmospheres . in our work",
    "we use the density functional theory , the most common _ ab initio _ method ( pbe functional and plane wave codes , see @xcite ) .",
    "below we briefly discuss two examples of our recent _ ab initio _ work ( see also kowalski , these proceedings ) .      by the time it reaches",
    "@xmath11 a white dwarf with an initial pure - he atmosphere should have accreted enough hydrogen from the interstellar medium for the latter to be detectable through the prominent bound - free opacity from the negative hydrogen ion .",
    "@xcite suggested that the negative hydrogen ion undergoes pressure ionization in the dense helium atmospheres , which could explain the absence of hydrogen in the spectra of helium - rich , cool white dwarfs . in order to address this problem , we performed quantum mechanical calculations of @xmath6 in dense helium .",
    "surprisingly , at least up to the density of helium of @xmath12 ( which is the highest density reached in the cool white dwarfs atmospheres ) the negative hydrogen ion remains bound , which is indicated by the presence of two electrons around the proton .",
    "some helium - rich atmosphere white dwarfs ( dq / dqp ) show the @xmath2 bands in the optical ( swan bands ) .",
    "this gives the opportunity not only to investigate the properties of molecular carbon in their atmospheres , but to use @xmath2 as a probe of the physical conditions in cool helium - rich atmospheres , which are still poorly understood .",
    "there are two noteworthy observational facts about the dq / dqp white dwarfs .",
    "cutoff in their cooling sequence at @xmath11 @xcite and the appearance of so called dqp stars , which show distorted swan - bands - like spectral features in the optical , at lower effective temperatures @xcite .",
    "the examples of spectra of both types of stars are given in figure [ f4 ] .",
    "two different explanations for the origin of the spectral features have been discussed in the literature .",
    "@xcite speculated that the dqp stars show pressure shifted bands of @xmath2 , while other researchers point to a different molecular species @xcite .",
    "the second idea was critically reviewed by @xcite . to elucidate the nature of the spectral features observed in dqp stars we performed an extensive investigation of spectroscopic properties of @xmath2 in dense helium , the electronic transition energy for the swan bands and the vibrational frequencies , in dense fluid helium @xcite .",
    "our calculations show that the electronic transition energy for the swan absorption increases significantly with the density ( @xmath14 ) , causing a blueward shift of the swan bands in the spectra of dqp stars .",
    "the observed shifts of about @xmath15 for most of the dqpes indicate that the bands form at density of @xmath16 , which is an order of magnitude lower than the one predicted by pure - he / c atmosphere models .",
    "this suggest pollution by hydrogen , which even in small amounts increases the opacity and can lower the atmospheric density to the required values .",
    "our result shows that the optical bands observed in dqp stars are pressure shifted @xmath2 bands as was originally proposed by @xcite .",
    "the same approach to the @xmath17 ballik - ramsay absorption ( 10000 - 18000@xmath18 bands , @xcite ) gives the blueward shifts of at least @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) for these bands in dqpes .",
    "the distortion of the ballik - ramsay bands may produce the spectral depression observed at @xmath21 for the dqp star lhs2293 @xcite .",
    "the atmospheres of cool white dwarfs could be understood only by having a reliable set of both hydrogen- and helium - rich atmosphere models , and modern _ ab initio _ methods of computational quantum mechanics are powerful tools to generate the necessary constitutive physics . with our improved models",
    "we have fitted the entire seds of various types of white dwarfs .",
    "most of the white dwarfs with @xmath22 show h - rich atmospheric composition and the coolest stars could be fitted only with the pure - h models .",
    "this indicates that the accretion of hydrogen from the ism plays an important role in the evolution of white dwarf atmospheres .",
    "our investigation of the properties of molecular carbon in the helium - rich atmosphere dq / dqp stars shows that the molecular bands observed in the optical spectra of dqp stars are the pressure shifted swan bands .",
