    "in the past 8 years , experiments have made big progress on the observations of charmonium - like or bottomonium - like state @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , which have stimulated theorists interest in revealing their underlying structures .",
    "thus , studying charmonium - like and bottomonium - like states is an active and important research field in hadron physics at present , which can further deepen our understanding of the properties of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and improve our knowledge about non - perturbative qcd .",
    "very recently , the belle collaboration @xcite reported the first observation of two charged bottomonium - like structure , which makes the family of bottomonium - like abundant . by analyzing the @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) invariant mass spectra of @xmath9 hidden - bottom dipion decays , belle observed that there exist two enhancement structures around 10610 mev and 10650 mev , which are named as @xmath0 and @xmath1 , where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are close to the thresholds of @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively .    due to the peculiarities of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ,",
    "theorists have paid more attentions to the observed novel phenomena by different approaches @xcite . in the following",
    ", we will introduce the theoretical progress on the study of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "before the observation of two @xmath13 structures @xcite , the belle collaboration measured the @xmath14@xmath15@xmath16 , @xmath17 processes near the peak of the @xmath12 resonance at @xmath18 gev @xcite , which indicates that there exist the anomalous @xmath16 and @xmath17 productions , i.e , the branching ratios of @xmath19 and @xmath20 are larger than the dipion - transition rates between the lower members of the @xmath21 family by two orders of magnitude @xcite .    for solving this puzzling phenomena ,",
    "rescattering mechanism was proposed in ref .",
    "since @xmath12 is above the threshold of @xmath22 meson pair , the coupled channel effect becomes important , which makes the intermediated hadronic loops constructed by @xmath23 mesons play crucial role to understanding the anomalous @xmath16 and @xmath17 production @xcite . as an alternative explanation , tetraquark state @xmath24[\\bar{b}\\bar{q}]$ ]",
    "was introduced in ref .",
    "later , authors of ref .",
    "@xcite studied the belle data by analyzing the dipion invariant mass spectrum and the @xmath25 distribution of @xmath26 decays into @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and claimed that the tetraquark interpretation can well describe the anomalous rates observed by belle @xcite .",
    "later , in ref .",
    "@xcite we indicated that the @xmath25 distribution of @xmath27 given by ref .",
    "@xcite is not consistent with the belle data , and proposed an alternative approach to try to explain belle observation of @xmath12 decays into @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where the interference between the direct dipion transition and the final state interaction corresponding to the first and the second diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , respectively . under this scenario",
    ", we can explain the anomalous rates of @xmath16 and @xmath17 production in @xmath12 decays , especially the inverse rates @xmath28 . besides , the dipion invariant spectrum and the @xmath25 distribution of @xmath29 can be reproduced .",
    "however , the @xmath25 distribution of @xmath30 can not be described by the scenario in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this fact mentioned above shows that a new puzzle appears in the @xmath30 decay , which can not be understood by the tetraquark state picture @xcite or rescattering mechanism @xcite .",
    "thus , we need to consider new mechanism involved in the @xmath30 decay .",
    "since two @xmath13 structures are from the hidden - bottom dipion decays of @xmath12 @xcite , we realized that there exists the extra intermediate @xmath0 and @xmath1 contributions to the @xmath12 decays just depicted by the last two diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",

    "this observation provides an indirect evidence to the existence of two charged @xmath13 structures , and gives a possible approach to solve the puzzles existing in the @xmath12 hidden - bottom dipion decays .",
    "however , we must find the source to generate the @xmath0 and @xmath1 structures . in the following",
    ", we introduce the exotic state explanations to @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "since the charged @xmath0 and @xmath1 are close to the @xmath10 and @xmath11 thresholds , respectively , @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be as good candidate of exotic state . before the observation of these two charged bottomonium - like states , the analysis in refs .",
    "@xcite indicates that there probably exists a loosely bound s - wave @xmath10 molecular state , where the one - boson - exchange ( obe ) model is applied to the dynamical calculation .    for further understanding the structure of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ,",
    "different theoretical groups have performed the study of @xmath0 and @xmath1 considering different exotic state assignments to @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which mainly include molecular states composed of @xmath31 mesons @xcite , and hidden - bottom tetraquark states @xcite .    by the obe model",
    ", we systematically calculated the interaction between @xmath32 and @xmath33 mesons , where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 meson exchanges are introduced when deducing the effective potential of @xmath38 molecular systems .",
    "if @xmath0 and @xmath1 are @xmath10 and @xmath11 molecular states respectively , we can construct their flavor wave functions @xcite , @xmath39 and @xmath40 $ ] for @xmath0 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 for @xmath1 .    under the breit approximation",
    ", the effective potential of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 systems can be related to the scattering amplitude @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 denote the masses of the initial and final states respectively .",
