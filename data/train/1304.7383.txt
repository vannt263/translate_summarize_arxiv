    "the ( gan)@xmath0/(zno)@xmath0 pseudobinary semiconductor alloys , which is discovered in this last years @xcite represents a new class of alloys typed as iii - v / ii - vi .",
    "this latter is different from classical isovalent semiconductors alloys ( i.e , iii - v / iii - v , ii - vi / ii - vi ) . from technological aspect",
    ", the growth of zno on gan heterostructure was realized using the vapor cooling condensation system and the related heterojunctions light - emitting diodes leds are then fabricated @xcite . but the main technological application is the hydrogen generation from water photosplitting through the photo - electrochemical cell ( pec ) .",
    "in fact , under visible light , it has a much higher water splitting efficiency compared to other oxides @xcite .",
    "the spectacular feature of this characteristic is attributed partly to the lower bandgap of alloys and in particular of the heterostructure compared to its parent elements gan and zno .",
    "few theoretical and experimental studies estimating the optical bowing parameter have been reported @xcite .",
    "large difference in the estimation values was than observed .",
    "the recent calculation of s. wang and l - w wang @xcite shows that the ordering plays an important role in the reduction of the bowing parameter .",
    "+ in the other hand , the tendency in this decade of several research groups to elaborate the gan and zno in the zinc - blend structure for technological interest , motivate us to contribute by a predictive study for this ( gan)@xmath0/(zno)@xmath0 superlattice in this structural phase .",
    "in fact the lattice constants of gan and zno are nearly identical and therefore this superlattice in the zinc - blend structure is then possible to growth .",
    "regarding the electronic properties from theoretical point of view , the problem of the underestimation of the bandgap using the local density and generalized gradient approximations ( lda and gga ) of density functional theory ( dft ) is very remarkably for zno in particular .",
    "the recent works have predicted the values of 0.710 ev @xcite for zno and 1.811 ev @xcite for gan which are lowered from the experimental ones by @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively .",
    "consequently , this error affects considerably the value of the large bandgap discontinuity at the heterointerface for ( gan)@xmath0/(zno)@xmath0 layered structure . in order to overcome this problem and improve the bandgap of the superlattice we used the most recent proposed approximation called modified becke - johnson ( mbj ) exchange potential @xcite .",
    "in fact , this technique is capable to describe with high accuracy the electronic structure of semiconductors and insulators giving rise to a significantly improved bandgap values to be much closer to the experimental ones . because of the lake of data about the structural and electronic properties for the studied superlattice we used two different ab initio techniques fp - lapw and lcpao in order to help understanding the related properties and consolidate our results .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows : in section [ compute ] , we describe briefly the computational techniques used in this study . in section",
    "[ results ] , we present and discuss our obtained results for the electronic properties of the studied superlattice .",

    "the calculations were performed using both full potential - linearized augmented plane wave ( fp - lapw ) and linear combination of localized pseudo atomic orbital ( lcpao ) methods , based on the density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite .",
    "the description of the specific parameters to each technique is given as :      we used the full - potential linear augmented plane - wave method ( fp - lapw ) implemented in the wien2k code @xcite which self - consistently , finds the eingenvalues and eingenfunction of the kohn - sham equations for the system @xcite .",

    "the muffin tin radius values for ga , n , zn and o were chosen at @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 atomic units ( a.u . ) respectively . the reciprocal space is sampled by a @xmath21 monkhorst - pack mesh @xcite with @xmath22-vectors in the irreducible brillouin zone .",
    "the iteration process is repeated until the calculated total energy of the crystal converges to less than @xmath23 .      for lcpao method @xcite , we used @xmath24 @xmath25 points for the @xmath25-space integration .",
    "the primitive pseudo atomic basis sets ga7.0-@xmath26 , zn6.0-@xmath26 , n6.0-@xmath27 and o7.0-@xmath28 are used for ga , zn , n and o atoms , respectively , where the abbreviation , for exemple , ga7.0-@xmath26 , represents the employement of three primitive @xmath29 orbitals , three primitive @xmath2 orbitals , three primitive @xmath30 orbitals and one primitive @xmath31 orbitals of a ga atom which are generated with a confinement radius of @xmath32 .",
