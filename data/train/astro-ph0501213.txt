    "understanding the formation of the uv spectrum of individual stars is essential in order to quantitatively determine stellar abundances for a number of chemical elements that only produce measurable features in the uv domain such as b , be , or the neutron capture elements pb and ge . a proper understanding of the spectra of individual stars is also crucial to interpret integrated light from galaxies and other stellar systems . the uv radiation field , besides affecting directly the abundances obtained from uv lines , has an important effect on the construction of atmospheric models through the energy balance .",
    "theoretical atmospheric structures computed under the assumptions of radiative equilibrium and local thermodynamical equilibrium are routinely employed in the analysis of spectra from astronomical objects .",
    "consequently , an error in the uv opacities translates into wrongly derived physical properties , namely , chemical composition and atmospheric parameters for individual stars , or ages for galaxies .",
    "a possible uv opacity source missing from the calculations has been proposed to explain an early reported failure to match the observed solar uv spectrum .",
    "it has been suggested that either line ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* vernazza , avrett & loeser 1976 ) or continuum ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bell , balachandran & bautista 2001 ) metal absorption could provide that extra opacity .",
    "however , several recent studies of uv spectra of other stars suggest that there is a reasonable agreement between theoretical models @xcite and observations .",
    "the analysis of the solar spectrum by @xcite concluded that even when using the most recent calculations of line and continuum opacities , classical model atmospheres predict too much uv flux .",
    "nonetheless , this result has been challenged by independent calculations by @xcite , who found that lte modeling can reproduce closely the observed solar flux at wavelengths longer than about 2600  , and uncertainties in the atomic line data fully account for the differences between computed and observed fluxes .",
    "high quality observations of stars with different atmospheric parameters than the sun present a promising way to solve the controversy .",
    "there is a second controversy that affects the absolute flux scale of uv observations .",
    "the most recent calibration of the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( iue ) archive has been dubbed ines ( _ iue newly extracted spectra _ ) , and will be discussed more deeply in the following section .",
    "iue obtained the largest available collection of astronomical uv spectra .",
    "there are at least two more calibrations of iue , both taking spectra to the hst flux scale , which is 7.2 % lower than the ines scale @xcite .",
    "these calibrations will be explained in sect .",
    "clarifying which flux scale should be adopted is a must to properly interpret observations .    in this paper",
    "we deal with vega ( @xmath1 lyr , hd 172167 , a0v ) .",
    "this star is not straightforward to model , because it has a dust and gas disk @xcite which produces an ir flux excess ; it is a fast rotator seen pole - on @xcite ; and it is possibly variable @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has a peculiar abundance pattern , similar to that of @xmath2 boo stars @xcite , that is , with a relative underabundance of fe - like elements with respect to the sun , but solar proportions of c , n , o , and s. despite these difficulties , vega is one of the few dwarf stars that can be used to test detailed calculations of uv irradiances : both precise uv spectrophotometry and independent measurements of its angular diameter are available .",
    "visible high resolution and high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) spectra of vega are also readily obtained from the ground . besides , the disk is expected to make no detectable contribution to the star s visible and uv spectrum , and it has been found that the influence of fast rotation is only important for the shape of spectral lines , with a small effect on the continuum limited to the spectral region in the vicinity of the balmer jump @xcite .",
    "our analysis puts to the test calculations of uv irradiances based on classical ( kurucz 1992 ) model atmospheres and modern line and continuous opacities .",
    "in addition to uv spectrophotometry of the star , we also use optical spectrophotometry and high - dispersion optical spectra to constrain the chemical abundances and narrow down the ranges of the involved model parameters . in   2 , we present a description of the observations employed . in   3 , we describe the analysis carried out and the results obtained , whose consequences are discussed in   4 .",
    "we have considered three versions of the average low - dispersion iue spectrum of vega :    * ines ; this is not a calibration of iue data processed with newsips ( _ new spectroscopic image processing system _ ; see garhart et al .",
    "1997 ) , but a new full processing of the raw data , improving the spectrum extraction to diminish the error sources present in newsips ( improving the noise model , the extraction method , the homogenization of the wavelength scale , and the flagging of the absolute calibrated extracted spectra ) .",
    "the relative fluxes were calibrated using a pure h ( da ) white dwarf , g191b2b , whose virtually featureless spectrum is relatively simple to model .",
    "the absolute flux scale relies on that of the uv satellite oao-2 @xcite . *",
    "bohlin s calibration @xcite , obtained from the calspec web page ; 8 standard stars ( 4 da s among them ) are used to calibrate fos ( _ faint object spectrograph _ ) observations , formerly onboard hst . by comparing their fos and iue fluxes ,",
    "a correction factor is determined , which is applied to each wavelength of a iuesips ( the earlier version of newsips ) spectrum of vega to place the data in the hst flux scale .",
    "this set of standard spectra has been updated by new stis and nicmos observations .",
    "the zero level of the flux scale is tied to the average over the v band for vega as measured by @xcite . *",
    "massa & fitzpatrick s calibration ; it takes into account the systematic errors in newsips spectra with the observation time and the temperature of the amplifying camera ( thda ) , and applies a correction factor to place the data into the hst scale .",
    "the three versions above are based on low - dispersion large - aperture iue spectra , but the particular individual spectra considered in the average , and some parts of the processing ( chiefly , the flux calibration ) differ among them .",
    "these spectra have a large spectral coverage with a resolution of @xmath3 6  .",
    "we combined several iue spectra from the ines and mast servers to produce the ines and m&f versions , respectively .",
    "the list of individual spectra is provided in table [ iue_cam ] . before combining the mast - iue spectra to produce the m&f version ,",
    "the fluxes were processed with the software kindly provided by these authors .",
    "bohlin s spectrum was directly obtained from the stsci web pages , as provided by r. bohlin .    as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : iuecal ] , bohlin s and m&f fluxes ( which share the same flux scale ) are @xmath310% higher than the ines fluxes for vega .",
    "this is higher , but roughly consistent within the error bars with the global differences reported by @xcite between fos and iue spectra for the ines reference star g191b2b .",
    "however , they noticed an almost linear reduction from a difference of @xmath37 % at 1500    to @xmath36 % at 3000  , while we find larger differences for vega in the ranges 1500 to 1700   and 2000 to 2500  .",
    "1 reveals that the m&f flux is higher than bohlin s at @xmath31800 and @xmath32000  .",
    "the feature in the m&f version at @xmath32000   coincides with the border between the short and long - wavelength cameras , where the uncertainty in the flux is higher .",
    "we have also compared our calculations with high - resolution iue spectra .",
    "these spectra have a large spectral coverage with a resolution @xmath4  .",
    "table [ iue_cam ] lists the high - resolution spectra considered , which were corrected in absolute flux to put them into the hst scale and then averaged to obtain the final one .",
    "we also compared bohlin s and ines fluxes for the eight primary standard stars on which bohlin s fluxes are based ( g191b2b , gd153 , gd71 , hz43 , hz44 , bd + 28 4211 , bd + 33 2642 , and bd + 75 325 ) .",
    "we used all the iue spectra available for these stars from the ines database , selecting only those pixels labeled with good quality and with flux errors lower than 20% .",
    "bohlin s flux is again higher than the ines one at all wavelengths and for all the stars , with the exception of the swp spectrum of bd + 75 325 .",
    "the mean relative difference in flux for the other seven stars is @xmath5 , which is again consistent with the global differences reported by @xcite .",
    "when studying the wavelength dependence , an increment of the difference is seen at @xmath32000    and from 2200 to 2500  , where the difference is over 8% , while in the other regions it is 5 - 7% , quite consistent with the larger differences observed in vega s case between 2000 and 2500  .",
    "visible spectrophotometry provides additional information that can not be neglected .",
    "we consider the spectrum compiled by @xcite by combining six different sources of ground - based measurements .",
    "this spectrum has a flux uncertainty of just about 1 - 2% in the optical and covers a wavelength range from 3300 to 10500  .",
    "the flux is tabulated in steps of 25  .",
    "this is both the bandwidth and step sizes reported by terez ( 1982 ) and arkharov & terez ( 1982 ) , who measured vega s flux in the entire region critically evaluated by hayes .",
    "the other sources considered by hayes provide fluxes measured over smaller spectral ranges with bandpasses from 10 to 100  , and approximate corrections for the bandwidth .",
    "based on this information , it seems therefore appropriate to compare these data to calculated fluxes smoothed to a resolution of at least 50  .",
    "in addition to the basic atmospheric parameters : effective temperature , surface gravity , and overall metallicity , the abundances of particular elements , whose ratio to iron may differ from solar , may affect the spectral energy distribution in the uv .",
    "initial estimates of those abundances are necessary to perform a meaningful comparison of computed and observed uv fluxes .",
    "the analysis of optical spectral lines provides abundances for the most relevant elements .",
    "we have used two different spectra , with different resolving power , obtained by our group at mcdonald observatory ( mount locke , texas ) , acquired with the _",
    "2dcoud _ cross - dispersed echelle spectrograph @xcite coupled to the harlan j. smith 2.7 m telescope .",
    "the first spectrum is part of the s@xmath6n survey of nearby stars ( allende prieto et al .",
    "2004 ) and is the average of observations secured in may 1 and 2 , 2001 .",
    "it has a resolving power ( r @xmath7 ) of @xmath8 , covering in full the optical range , extending into the near ir . as the spectrograph provides full coverage only from about 3600  to @xmath35100   in a single exposure for this resolution , with increasingly larger gaps between redder orders ,",
    "two overlapping settings were used to circumvent the problem .",
    "the second spectrum was obtained at the focal station f1 , and has r @xmath3 173000 , covers the range from @xmath34400 to @xmath37600   with some small gaps , and was obtained in june 912 , 2000 .",
    "the spectral coverage is much smaller at f1 , and 10 tilts of the grating / prisms were needed to achieve the final coverage .",
    "the ccd registered pieces of @xmath316 adjacent orders .",
    "for both the high- and intermediate - resolution spectra , the detector was tk3 , a thinned @xmath9 tektronix ccd with 24 @xmath10 m pixels , and we used grating e2 , a 53.67 gr mm@xmath11 r2 echelle from milton roy co. for the spectrum with r @xmath12 , we used slit # 4 , which has a central width of 511 @xmath10 m ( or approx .",
    "1.2 arcsec on the sky ) . for the spectrum with r @xmath3 173000",
    ", we used slit # 2 , which has a central width of 145 @xmath10 m , and partially masked the collimator .",
    "a careful data reduction was applied to both spectra , using iraf , which consisted of overscan ( bias ) and scattered - light subtraction ; flatfielding ; extraction of one - dimensional spectra ; wavelength calibration ; and continuum normalization .",
    "a few particular elements may contribute significant opacity in the uv .",
    "iron is known to dominate line absorption virtually for all spectral types .",
    "continuous absorption from other metals may also be significant or even dominant .",
    "the main contributors to the uv continuous opacity change with the spectral type and , therefore , it is important to evaluate which metals are relevant and provide reasonable estimates of their abundances to calculate realistic uv fluxes . the ability of an ion to contribute bound - free opacity depends on its atomic structure and its abundance . as a preliminary step ,",
    "ion abundances for the 30 first elements in the first three states of ionization were computed for a star like vega , using the model parameters preferred by castelli & kurucz ( 1994 ; an effective temperature t@xmath13 = 9550 k and gravity @xmath14 = 3.95 ) using saha and boltzmann equations . at this point",
    "we simply assumed solar photospheric abundances @xcite .",
    "next , we computed synthetic visible and near - uv spectra including continuous opacity produced by only h ( including bound - bound h opacity , i.e. hydrogen lines , as part of continuous opacity ) and each of the most abundant ions in vega .",
    "the calculations were carried out with the program synplot , a wrapper of synspec @xcite for idl .",
    "bound - free opacities were obtained from topbase @xcite and smoothed to dilute resonances whose exact frequencies are not accurately known ( allende prieto et al . 2003 ) .",
    "we studied all the ions with abundances relative to h larger than 10@xmath15 : hei , ci , cii , ni , n ii , oi , oii , naii , mgii , alii , siii , sii , caii , feii and niii . a contribution could be missed if it corresponds to an ion with a low abundance but an unusually high photoionization cross section , but we believe our list is complete . for these calculations ,",
    "the atmospheric parameters of @xcite were used as well as solar abundances for each element , except for fe , for which it was adopted [ fe / h ] @xmath16 , to be consistent with the model atmosphere : [ m / h ] = @xmath170.5 . by comparing the spectra derived including continuous opacity due to h plus any given ion to that obtained including only neutral h continuous opacity , we deduce the relevance of each ion s continuous opacity to the observed fluxes .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cont_opac ] for the most important contributors .",
    "hydrogen bound - free and line absorption dominate the opacity blueward of l@xmath18 , shaping the near - uv and optical spectrum of vega . at wavelengths",
    "longer than about 1500  , neutral hydrogen and the h@xmath0 ion dominate the total bound - free opacity .",
    "si and c contribute significantly to the continuous opacity between 1200 and 1450  .",
    "hei would also appear in the figure below 1400   with a maximum of @xmath31.5 % , but it has not been included for clarity .",
    "[ fig : opac ] shows the continuum and line absorption due to each ion .",
    "fei lines swamp the uv spectrum of solar - like stars . at the temperatures in vega s photosphere , iron is almost completely ionized ( n@xmath19n@xmath20 ) , and the atomic line absorption is mainly produced by feii ( around half the total absorption of lines and most of the absorption due to fe lines ) .",
    "molecules are virtually inexistent at these warm temperatures .",
    "we considered different sources for the atomic line data , finding that a linelist based on data compiled by kurucz and distributed with synplot provided the best results .",
    "the agreement with the observations was only marginally improved when updating stark line damping parameters extracted from vald @xcite .",
    "all the fluxes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : opac ] include a contribution to the total opacity by incoherent electron scattering .",
    "although thomson scattering is wavelength independent , the vertical structure of the atmosphere makes its role maximum at about 1300  , where it effectively reduces the emerging flux by about 4 % , and over 1 % for @xmath21  .    in conclusion , to model the uv spectrum of a star like vega",
    "it is necessary to account for h , c , si , and fe opacities in as much detail as possible .",
    "@xcite estimated a set of fundamental parameters for a large sample of nearby stars , using hipparcos parallaxes to accurately constrain their positions in the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "comparison with evolutionary calculations by @xcite allowed them to provide masses , radii , gravities and effective temperatures for 17,219 stars .",
    "their estimate for vega provides : @xmath23 .",
    "given the limited effect of gravity on the uv spectrum , we will adopt this value and attempt to determine the effective temperature and angular diameter from the observations in the optical and near - infrared .",
    "this can be achieved by comparing the computed emitted flux from kurucz model grids ( which have @xmath14 and t@xmath13 as the independent parameters ) , transformed to computed received flux by using the angular diameter , to the observed flux . in these regions , metal absorption is modest , which allows us to study these two parameters fairly independent of the details of the chemical composition .",
    "we minimized the sum of @xmath24 statistics between observed and computed spectra in three wavelength regions weighted according to the approximate uncertainty in the observed fluxes inferred from bohlin s analysis in the uv and hayes in the visible range , respectively ( 4% between 1600 and 2150   and between 2200 and 3000  , and 2% between 4150 and 8480  , excluding balmer lines ) .",
    "we used the nelder - mead simplex algorithm @xcite for the minimization . using synspec , we computed a grid of fluxes based on interpolated kurucz s model atmospheres @xcite with t@xmath13 running between 9350 and 9650 k. as the model atmospheres are available in steps of 250 k , we linearly interpolated all the relevant quantities as a function of the optical depth .",
    "we matched selected spectral regions , excluding the segments where special difficulties exist . in particular , the spectrum in the vicinity of the balmer jump ( 30004150  ) was discarded because hayes advises about significant errors in this region and the effect of fast rotation is important @xcite . at this stage , a solar he abundance was used and the metal abundances are from @xcite , including [ fe / h ] = @xmath170.57 dex , which was adopted as the metallicity for the model atmosphere [ m / h ] = @xmath170.7 dex , using the same conversion factor as @xcite .",
    "the best - fitting pairs ( t@xmath25 ) and the quality of the fit are displayed in table [ fit_param ] .",
    "the fit is clearly better in the uv using bohlin s calibration than using the ines one , so the overall uv flux level is better reproduced with synthetic spectra when the observed spectrum is in bohlin s scale .",
    "[ fig : vis_spec ] confronts the observed flux ( using bohlin s calibration in the top panel and the ines calibration in the bottom panel ) and the computed flux that best matches it . in that figure ,",
    "the computed flux is clearly lower than the observed one for @xmath26 4500    when using the parameters of the best fit with ines calibration , and it is clearly higher than the observed one for @xmath27 3000  .",
    "this can be explained when taking into account that ines uv flux is lower than bohlin s one , but the same visible observed flux has been used .",
    "then , the computed flux matching the ines calibration is lower than the one matching bohlin s uv observed flux , and the same is observed in the visible next to the uv region .",
    "such effect is the result of diminishing t@xmath13 and increasing @xmath22 to match the ines scale .",
    "a comparison between these parameters for vega and those taken from the literature is made in table [ param_liter ] .",
    "the selected literature values do not include analyses of uv spectra from iue .",
    "t@xmath13 runs the gamut between 9430 and 9660 k and @xmath22 between 3.24 and 3.28 mas .",
    "these values are consistent with the parameters obtained with bohlin s calibration ( or with the m&f one , given that both are on the same scale ) . however , the angular diameter derived from the analysis of the ines spectrum is significantly higher than the literature values .",
    "in addition , there are only two t@xmath13 determinations that are consistent with the result we find if the ines calibration is adopted : the extreme value found by moon & dworetsky ( 1985 ) and that by @xcite .",
    "as the difference in the absolute flux between ines and the other calibrations amounts to more than 10% for vega , we have derived an average uv spectrum as the mean of bohlin s calibration and m&f , not taking into account ines . using this flux ,",
    "we have matched again the region between 2200 and 8500   ( without the zone between 3000 and 4150  ) , obtaining the following result :    t@xmath13 = 9620@xmath28 k , @xmath22 = 3.272 @xmath29 0.03",
    "mas    where the error bars of our t@xmath13 and @xmath22 estimations were derived by perturbing the best - fitting parameters until the flux variation exceeded the error bars assigned to the observed spectrum .",
    "the same analysis was carried out using new model atmospheres @xcite which were calculated with overshooting turned off ( resulting in a steeper rise in temperature with depth in the region where the optical continuum is formed ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and using updated values for the solar elemental abundances and revised opacity distribution functions ( odfnew ) . the reason for this new analysis is to check the effect on colors of convective overshoot and the parameters thus obtained were :    t@xmath13 = 9575 k , @xmath22 = 3.271 mas ,    where @xmath30 = 2.4 % and @xmath31 = 0.7 % .",
    "these values provide a slightly better fit , but are nonetheless consistent with thoses obtained using older model atmospheres and also with most values from the literature .",

    "tables [ nofe_abun ] and [ fe_abun ] show the observed ew of each spectral line ( with its uncertainty ) and the abundance ( log n(x / h ) + 12 ) derived using parameters in the model atmospheres from different references : , and ours ( in which we have used a microturbulence of 2 km s@xmath11 ) .",
    "other reasonable values for the microturbulence ( 0 - 3 km s@xmath11 ) would have a negligible effect on the mean iron abundance .",
    "the mean difference of @xmath39 dex between iron abundances derived from fei and feii lines is perhaps due to the nlte effects in the formation of the former ones .",
    "using the abundances obtained from optical spectral lines , we found the mean abundance of each element , shown with its standard deviation in table [ abuns ] . in the same table , we show the original abundances found in the literature using the corresponding stellar parameters and , for c and si , the values that we obtained from the analysis of the uv flux .",
    "besides , solar abundances from @xcite are shown , written as gs98 in the table .",
    "the uncertainties in the line - based abundances due to t@xmath13 ( 9620@xmath28k ) and to @xmath14 ( assumed 3.98 @xmath29 0.1 ) are in the range 0.01 - 0.07 dex and 0.01 - 0.06 dex , respectively .",
    "we can see from table [ abuns ] that c , n , and o abundances for vega are similar to those of the sun , while mg , al , si , ca , cr , and fe abundances are between @xmath170.3 and @xmath170.7 dex compared to the solar ones .",
    "this is consistent with previous studies , and suggests that vega is a mild @xmath2 boo star .",
    "we have compiled spectroscopic observations from the literature to globally examine the spectral energy distribution of vega in the uv , optical and near - ir .",
    "we also obtained new high - dispersion optical spectra and derived lte abundances from atomic lines to further constrain the modeling of the spectral energy distribution .",
    "different versions of the mean uv spectrum based on iue data are available , and significant differences ( @xmath40 % ) exist among them .",
    "we model vega s fluxes as a way to discriminate between the different flux scales .",
    "the highest consistency is found adopting the hst flux scale .",
    "we identify the most important contributors to the continuum opacity in the uv for vega .",
    "the bound - free opacities of neutral h and the h@xmath41 ion play a dominant role above @xmath31450  .",
    "ci is the most important metal contributor below that wavelength , followed by siii .",
    "a solar he abundance has been assumed when calculating the observed spectrum , consistent with some of the previous determinations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but different to the lower value used by other authors ( e.g. in the calculations by * ? ? ?",
    "this constitutes a non - negligible error source , since a small change in that abundance produces a measurable variation in the abundance of the h species , resulting in a significant change in the continuum opacity or , equivalently , in the computed flux .",
    "the stellar effective temperature ( t@xmath13 ) and the angular diameter ( @xmath22 ) are derived by comparing computed spectra with the observed optical and near uv spectrum above 2200  , where the only important contributors to the continuous opacity are h species , and metal abundances are not very relevant .",
    "we obtain t@xmath13 = 9620@xmath28 k and @xmath22 = 3.272 @xmath29 0.03 mas . a good agreement between computed and observed",
    "spectra is also obtained when using high resolution spectra in the uv , as it is shown for three randomly selected regions . once the atmospheric parameters were derived , we made use of the uv flux to constrain the c and si abundances .",
    "the abundance of si obtained from the uv continuum [ si / h ] = @xmath42 ) is very different from the value we determine from the spectral lines in the optical ( [ si / h ] = @xmath43 ) , but consistent within the large uncertainty of the uv - based value . the abundance of c obtained from the uv continuum ( [ c / h ] = @xmath44 ) , however , is in good agreement with the mean value determined from optical lines ( [ c / h ] = @xmath45 ) .",
    "departures from lte are known to affect both ci and siii lines ( wedemeyer 2001 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but are small compared to the uncertainties of our uv - based abundances . we have shown that at least part of the spectral regions of the uv spectrum of vega that our lte models can not reproduce appear to be affected by departures from lte .",
    "in particular , two uv regions with deep ci and sii lines ( @xmath3 1560 and @xmath3 1660  ) are better reproduced when using nlte models with c and si abundances from the uv continuum fit .",
    "a further study of high - dispersion spectra in the uv , departures from lte in the modeling and the effect of rapid rotation is clearly the next step .    together with a previous lte analysis of the uv solar spectrum ( allende prieto et al .",
    "2003 ) , we arrive at the preliminary conclusion that our understanding of stellar atmospheric opacities in the uv is fairly complete for spectral types a to g. departures from lte may contribute somewhat for the solar case , but are expected to be more important for a star like vega ( see , e.g. , hubeny 1991 ; hauschildt et al .",
    "1999 ) . in the case of vega , the distortion from spherical symmetry induced by rapid rotation must be accounted for , in order to disentangle such effect from departures from lte and other approximations adopted .",
