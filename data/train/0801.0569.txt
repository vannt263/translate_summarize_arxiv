    "why do some stars oscillate while others do not ?",
    "this question is particularly relevant for the class of rapidly oscillating ap ( roap ) stars for which the discovery of high - frequency oscillations came as a surprise @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3scuti pulsations of stars in this area of the colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) were not theoretically predicted to produce the observed high - frequency , high - overtone modes .",
    "subsequently , considerable observational and theoretical efforts have been able to describe most pulsation properties of roap stars through i ) the oblique pulsator model @xcite , ii ) the probable driving mechanism of the pulsations @xcite and iii ) their link with the magnetic fields present in ap stars ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "ap stars are chemically peculiar stars that range from early - b to early - f spectral types with the majority having detectable magnetic fields with strengths of a few @xmath4 to a few @xmath5 g ( @xcite , according to whom @xmath6 per cent have mean longitudinal fields above 400 g ) . for the cool ap stars ( also called cp2 stars ) , abundance anomalies are typically visible in their spectra as abnormally strong absorption lines , particularly of rare - earth elements ( rees ) .",
    "candidate roap stars can therefore be selected photometrically due to the influence of these spectral features on narrow - band photometric indices such as those of the strmgren filter system ( @xcite , see also sect.[sec : selection ] ) .",
    "the high - overtone roap oscillations are thought to be driven by the opacity - mechanism acting in the partial hydrogen ionisation zone @xcite .",
    "the frequency range of the excited modes is related to the presence of strong magnetic fields in roap stars that i ) directly stabilise the low - frequency , low - order @xmath3scuti oscillations , excited by the @xmath7-mechanism acting in the partial ionisation zone @xcite , and ii ) indirectly enhance the driving of high - order oscillations by the @xmath7-mechanism acting in the partial hydrogen ionisation zone @xcite . in particular , the stabilisation of the @xmath3scuti modes can be explained by the dissipation of slow alfvn waves @xcite and by the suppression of turbulent motion in the outer layers of the magnetic pole regions of roap stars , which speeds up gravitational settling of helium and drains it from the ionisation zone @xcite .",
    "an implication of the high radial order of the observed modes of roap stars is that the observable pulsation amplitudes become depth dependent .",
    "this pulsational structure provides a unique opportunity for studying the magneto - acoustic structure of the pulsations in 3d because of the element stratification in the atmospheres of these stars .",
    "different elements , such as fe , pr , nd , eu and h , act as tracers for the pulsation structure due to their different properties regarding formation depth and extent of formation regions .",
    "examples of depth - dependent measurements of pulsations are now numerous , such as @xcite .",
    "the roap stars are thus unique objects for studying the interactions among stellar pulsation , magnetic fields and atomic diffusion .",
    "the latter is important for , e.g. , estimates of globular cluster ages where he settling is significant , pulsation driving mechanisms in sdb and @xmath8cephei stars where radiative levitation of fe is needed for instability , and the standard solar model where both he settling and radiative levitation of some metals are included .",
    "only 37 roap stars are known at present ( @xcite ) despite several searches for rapid pulsation in ap stars , such as those by @xcite .",
    "the selection of roap candidates is mostly based on photometric indices pointing to chemical peculiarities in the spectra .",
    "there is at present no clear correlation between radial velocity ( rv ) amplitude and photometric amplitude in roap stars ( see table  1 of @xcite ) . for a ( non - exhaustive ) list of spectroscopic studies of roap stars ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculated a theoretical instability strip for roap stars and compared it to locations of 16 known roap stars .",
    "the region around the terminal age main - sequence is remarkably devoid of pulsators which , as cunha points out , could be an observational bias .",
    "she predicted that more luminous and evolved ap stars may pulsate with lower frequencies ( @xmath9mhz ) which makes it harder to detect them in the typically short high - speed observing runs . note that this frequency range overlaps with the highest @xmath3sct frequencies , such as for hd34282 ( 0.92mhz , @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , she proposed that this absence of known evolved roap stars could reflect a real deficiency in the fraction of pulsators in that region of the hr diagram , resulting from the fact that the magnetic field is less likely to suppress envelope convection in more evolved stars .",
    "the photometric survey by @xcite was indeed less sensitive to low - amplitude roap periods longer than 15min and got a null - result for hd116114 for which a 21-min oscillation was recently detected spectroscopically by @xcite .",
    "a dedicated survey of luminous ap stars therefore seems pertinent .",
    "ap stars inside the roap instability strip that do not exhibit any detectable variability are called non - oscillating ap ( noap ) stars . as seen in , e.g. , the astrometric hr - diagram by @xcite ( @xcite , their figure 2 ) for roap and ap stars , the apparent noap stars occupy essentially the same regions as the roap stars . however , the noap stars appear to be systematically more evolved than the roap stars @xcite . to fully understand the mechanism responsible for driving oscillations in roap stars , it is essential to confirm and understand why so many stars with similar characteristics are apparently stable against pulsations .",
    "the apparent absence of oscillations in noap stars does not , however , necessarily mean that oscillations are suppressed .",
    "for instance , detection of oscillations may depend on lifetimes of excited modes ( may be days for some roap stars , @xcite ) , on beating between multiple modes , on the geometry of the magnetic field s orientation and the aspect in which the stellar surface is observed together with the surface distribution of the chemical elements used to detect the oscillations .",
    "further , the signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath10 ) of the obtained photometry or spectroscopy may simply be too low to detect the typically low - amplitude roap pulsations .",
    "finding high precision null - results for a statistically significant sample of roap candidates would be a safe basis for concluding whether noap stars exist or whether the current lack of known luminous roap stars is an observational bias . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", stars located inside the theoretical instability strip may be noap stars if the magnetic field is too weak to effectively suppress convection in the stellar envelope .",
    "a good test sample should , therefore , also include stars with strong magnetic fields .    to try to answer the question of whether the absence of observed variability among the luminous ap stars is an observational selection effect only , or in fact due to intrinsic properties , we have studied 9 such stars at high radial - velocity precision .",
    "our immediate goal with uves was to search these luminous ap stars for roap oscillations at high radial velocity precision .",
    "table[tab : obslog ] lists the known properties of the 9 targets and gives an observing log for the collected spectra .",
    "we find no pulsation in any of the 9 stars ; tables[tab : cogpow ] and [ tab : ccpow ] below present the null - results of the frequency analyses .    in the following sections , we describe selection and observation of the targets along with the data reduction in sect.2 , then follows the data analyses including estimation of physical parameters and the radial - velocity analysis in sect.3 .",
    "we show that our analyses reach the same precision as other radial - velocity studies of roap stars in the literature and we then give the results for each target on a star - by - star basis .",
    "finally we discuss the null - results in sect.4 .",
    "these figures show star - by - star amplitude spectra calculated for combined radial - velocity series for elements as indicated by top labels : ` all ' indicates all available lines , ` ndpr ' all lines for neodymium and praseodymium . for centre - of - gravity line measurements .",
    "note that for double lines , both components were measured separately and included .",
    "compare with table[tab : cogpow ] ."
