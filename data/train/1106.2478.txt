    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the calibration performance of interest rate models based on the wiener chaos expansion .",
    "chaotic models were introduced in @xcite as an axiomatic framework for interest rates satisfying both no arbitrage and positivity conditions , following the line of research initiated by @xcite , where zero  coupon bond prices are modeled as @xmath0 for a parametrized family of positive martingales @xmath1 .",
    "it was then shown in @xcite and @xcite that one can focus instead on modeling a supermartingale @xmath2 which is related to the martingales @xmath1 through @xmath3 the chaotic approach is derived from the observation that @xmath2 can itself be written as the conditional variance of a terminal random variable @xmath4 .",
    "this square integrable random variable then has a unique wiener chaos decomposition , and studying the way its expansion coefficients affect the corresponding interest rates model becomes the subject of the theory .",
    "notice the successive simplifications in the class of objects that one needs to model : from an entire family of martingales @xmath1 in the flesaker ",
    "hughston framework , to the process @xmath2 in the potential approach , and finally the single random variable @xmath4 in chaotic models .",
    "arguably , each step of the way reduces the arbitrariness in the modeling exercise , with presumed advantages for calibration to real data . in particular",
    ", the chaos expansion allows one to successively introduce randomness in the model in a way that can , in principle , be made to correspond to the increased complexity of financial instruments under consideration .",
    "such are the types of statements that we propose to put to test in this paper .",
    "models in the flesaker ",
    "hughston framework have been implemented and calibrated , for example , in @xcite and @xcite , whereas implementations of the potential approach can be found in @xcite and @xcite . to our knowledge , we present here the first practical implementation and calibration to market data of chaotic interest rate models .",
    "we adopt the day - by - day calibration methodology used in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the motivation for this is to capture the prices of liquid interest rate derivatives such as caps and swaptions by a model as parsimonious as possible , which can then be used for pricing and hedging of exotic options , such as the chooser flexible cap and bermudan swaption .    after reviewing the chaotic approach in section [ approach ]",
    ", we implement to two separate calibration exercises . in section [ term_calibration ]",
    "we consider the calibration of chaotic models to the observed term structure of interest rates . for comparison",
    ", we use the nelson ",
    "siegel @xcite and svensson @xcite models for forward rates as benchmarks .",
    "these so called descriptive models @xcite are examples of a general exponential  polynomial class of models analyzed in @xcite , which we use as motivation for the parametric form we adopt for the chaos coefficient functions .",
    "we find in this section that chaotic models perform comparably to descriptive models with the same number of parameters , with the advantage of avoiding problems with positivity and consistency .",
    "we then move to a full calibration to yields and option prices in section [ option ] .",
    "we recall known expressions for option prices in a second chaos model , derive the corresponding formulas in a third chaos model , and calibrate them to two separate data sets in three different ways . for comparison",
    ", we also calibrate the hull and white model @xcite , the rational lognormal proposed in @xcite and a lognormal libor market model @xcite .",
    "we find that chaos models generally perform much better than the hull and white and rational lognormal models and have fitting errors comparable to those obtained with a libor model .",
    "when we apply an information criterion that takes into account the different number of parameters in the models , we find that one of our third chaos models consistently outperforms the libor market model .",
    "section [ conclusion ] concludes the paper by summarizing the results and pointing to future research in the area .",
    "we review the framework proposed in @xcite , whereby a general positive interest rate model with no arbitrage opportunities is associated with a square integrable terminal random variable @xmath5 , which can then be modeled using a wiener chaos expansion .",
    "let @xmath6 be a probability space equipped with the standard augmented filtration @xmath7 generated by a @xmath8dimensional brownian motion @xmath9 and suppose that @xmath10 is a random variable with the property that @xmath5 is not @xmath11measurable for any finite value of @xmath12 and @xmath13=0 $ ] . using the martingale representation theorem ,",
    "we can write @xmath14 for an adapted process @xmath15 . denoting the conditional variance of @xmath5 with respect to the @xmath16algebra @xmath11 by @xmath17)^2\\right|{\\cal f}_t\\right],\\ ] ] it follows from the it isometry that @xmath18=e\\left[\\left.\\int_t^\\infty \\sigma_s^2 ds\\right|{\\cal f}_t\\right].\\ ] ] defining the increasing adapted process @xmath19 we have that @xmath20,\\ ] ] from which it follows that @xmath2 is a potential , that is , a positive supermartingale satisfying @xmath21\\to 0 $ ] as @xmath22 .",
    "it is then well  known ( see , for example , @xcite ) that @xmath23 can be used as a state  price density for an arbitrage  free interest rate model in which the price of a zero  coupon bond with maturity @xmath24 is given by @xmath25}{v_t}=\\frac{z_{tt}}{z_{tt } } , \\qquad 0\\leq t \\leq t < \\infty,\\ ] ] where @xmath26 ,   \\qquad 0\\leq t \\leq t < \\infty.\\ ] ] it follows from that for each fixed @xmath12 the processes @xmath27 , and consequently the bond prices @xmath28 , are decreasing functions of the maturity @xmath24 , which in turn implies that all instantaneous forward rates @xmath29 are automatically positive in this framework .",
    "furthermore , the short  rate @xmath30 and the market price of risk vector @xmath31 are determined by the dynamics of @xmath2 as follows : @xmath32 for later use , we introduced the family of positive martingales @xmath33 , \\qquad 0\\leq t \\leq s < \\infty,\\ ] ] so that @xmath2 can be written as in and bond prices as in .",
    "returning to the squared integrable random variable @xmath5 , the wiener chaos decomposition ( see @xcite and @xcite ) says that it can be written as the @xmath34convergent sum @xmath35 for deterministic square ",
    "integrable functions @xmath36 called the chaos coefficients of @xmath5 .",
    "we say that an interest rate model is an @xmath37-th chaos model if the decomposition for the random variable @xmath5 can be completely determined by its first @xmath37 coefficient functions .",
    "the basic insight of the chaotic approach is that the decomposition above provides a way to add complexity to an interest rate model in a controlled manner .",
    "for example , as we will see in the next section , the first order chaos correspond to deterministic interest rate models , whereas the second order chaos give rise to stochastic interest rate models with randomness governed by a parametric family of gaussian processes .",
    "more importantly for calibration purposes , the increased complexity in the interest models should be related to the instruments that are available in the market . in what follows ,",
    "we propose a systematic way to calibrate chaotic interest models starting with bond prices alone and then gradually increasing the complexity of market instruments included in the calibration .",
    "our general strategy will consist of choosing general parametric forms for the deterministic functions @xmath38 , @xmath39 and then fit the parameters to market data according to the bond and option pricing formulas emerging from the models .",
    "we now describe how the prices of the most common interest rate options can be written in terms of the quantities defined in section [ definitions ] . since @xmath2 is a state  price density , it follows that the price at time @xmath12 of a derivative with payoff @xmath40 is given by @xmath41}{v_t}.\\ ] ] we see that expression for bond prices is simply a special case of with @xmath42 .",
    "we apply this general expression to european put options , caplets and swaptions , since these will be the only ones needed in our calibration section , although similarly results also hold for other interest rate derivatives , notably call options and floors ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we follow the standard definitions and notations in @xcite .",
    "a put option with maturity @xmath12 and strike price @xmath43 written on a bond with maturity @xmath44 correspond to the following payoff @xmath45 using , we see that the price of the a bond option at time @xmath46 is given by @xmath47}{v_s}=\\frac{e[(kz_{tt}-z_{tt})^+|{\\cal f}_{s}]}{v_s}.\\ ] ]    a caplet is a call option with strike @xmath43 and maturity @xmath24 written on a spot libor rate @xmath48 for the time interval @xmath49 $ ] , that is , it is defined by the payoff @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a fixed notional amount .",
    "recalling that the spot libor rate is defined as @xmath52 we see from that the value of a caplet at time @xmath53 is @xmath54}{v_s}\\\\ % = & \\frac{{\\cal n}}{v_s}e\\left[\\left.\\frac{v_{t}}{z_{tt}}\\big(v_{t}-z_{tt}(1+k(t - t))\\big)^+\\right|{\\cal f}_s\\right]\\\\ % = & \\frac{{\\cal n}}{v_s}e\\left[\\left.e\\left[\\left.\\frac{v_{t}}{z_{tt}}\\big(v_t - z_{tt}(1+k(t - t))\\big)^+\\right|{\\cal f}_{t}\\right]\\right|{\\cal f}_s\\right]\\\\ = & \\frac{{\\cal n}}{v_s}e\\left[\\left.\\big(z_{tt}-z_{tt}(1+k(t - t))\\big)^+\\right|{\\cal f}_s\\right]\\\\ \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] comparing and it is easy to deduce the following well  known relation @xcite : @xmath55 which allows us to obtain prices for caplets provided we know how to calculate the prices of bond put options .",

    "this concludes our general overview of chaotic models .",

    "all of these examples fall within the exponential - polynomial family of forward rates analyzed in @xcite : @xmath82    as explained in @xcite , descriptive models provide a snapshot , but not a movie . that is to say ,",
    "they do not provide a model for the stochastic evolution of interest rates .",
    "nevertheless , they can be used to price simple instruments such as forward rate agreements and swaps , which do not depend on the dynamics of interest rates .",
    "they have also been widely used by central banks for the purposes of monetary policy ( see the table presented in @xcite ) .    for more complicated interest rate derivatives ,",
    "it becomes necessary to embed such static descriptions into a fully dynamic model .",
    "for example , one can use the fitted forward rate curve @xmath80 as the initial term structure for a model within the heath  jarrow  morton framework @xcite , supplementing it with the specification of the volatility structure .",
    "in other words , the specification of the initial term structure used as an input is done separately from its stochastic evolution .    by contrast , instead of focusing on the forward rates @xmath80 , we propose to use the observed term structure at time @xmath63 to calibrate the deterministic functions @xmath83 , which then completely specify the stochastic evolution of interest rates .",
    "since these are markedly different procedures , their performance need to be compared using real observed data , as we do later in this section . before that we need to describe the term structure of interest rates for chaotic models of different orders in mode detail .      in a first chaos model",
    "we have @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a deterministic function of one variable . comparing this with",

    "these observations show that first chaos models characterize general arbitrage ",
    "free , positive , deterministic interest rate term structures , which should not be immediately disregarded as trivial , since they constitute the starting point for the majority of the applications of interest rate theory .",
    "chaotic models then provide a well  defined way to embed such deterministic models into their stochastic generalizations , as we will demonstrate in the remainder of this paper .    from the point of view of calibration , we can calibrate a first chaos model to the term structure at time @xmath63 by focusing on the equation @xmath95 because of the deterministic nature of first chaos models , this is enough to characterize bond prices at all times , since it follows from that @xmath96 .      in a second chaos model",

    "these remarks point to a general yet delicate feature of chaotic models : one can achieve increased stochastic complexity in the form of higher order chaos at the expense of having to calibrate complicated expressions that are not necessarily supported by the data available . our approach to deal with this problem",
    "consists of increasing the complexity of the models as gradually as possible , while carefully evaluating their statistical performance when calibrated to real data .",

    "the differences between chaos models will become apparent , however , when we tackle the calibration to option prices in section [ option ] .",

    "we proposed and implemented a systematic way to calibrate chaotic models for interest rates to available term structure and option data .",
    "the calibration performance to initial term structures is comparable to that of traditional descriptive models for forward rates with the same number of parameters , with the advantages of guaranteed positivity and consistency with a fully stochastic model for the time evolution of interest rates .",

    "if we take the number of parameters into account , a conservative information criterion shows that one of our chaos models consistently outperforms the benchmark libor market model .",
    "the underlying reason for the superior performance of libor market models when compared , for example , to markovian short  rate models is the rich correlation structure they provide for libor forward rates at different dates .",
    "similarly , in chaos models the resulting short rate is in general not markovian , and our calibration results show that an equally rich correlation structure can be achieved without having to model forward rates individually under each corresponding forward measure .    the next step in our program is to consider options that are not at - the - money .",
    "the current industry standard for this is to use stochastic volatility models for either forward or swap rates . in a paper in preparation",
    "we show that chaos models naturally give rise to rates with stochastic volatility , and explore this fact to calibrate them to the smile observe in interest rate data .",
    "expectedly , much work remains to be done , in particular on the interpretation of the financial interpretation of the chaos coefficients , where techniques such as principal components analysis might shed some additional light on the meaning of the most relevant calibrated parameters .",

    "we begin by listing our choices of chaos coefficients of different orders according to the general parametric form in .",
    "we start with first chaos models directly inspired by the nelson ",
    "siegel and svensson parametric forms in , namely : @xmath151    we now describe in detail the steps we take to calibrate these chaos models to observed yield curves , which we obtain from clean prices of treasury coupon strips in the uk bond market from the united kingdom debt management office ( dmo ) according to @xmath152 using an actual / actual day - count convention @xcite .",
    "we consider the following two data sets :    1 .",
    "bond prices at @xmath153 dates ( every other business day ) from january @xmath154 to january @xmath155 , with around 49 to 62 maturities for each date .",
    "bond prices at @xmath156 dates ( every friday ) from december @xmath157 to december @xmath158 , with around 100 to 130 maturities for each date .",
    "note that the first dataset contains a volatile market including the period of the long - term capital management ( ltcm ) crisis , whereas the second dataset corresponds to more moderate market conditions .",
    "we then apply the maximum likelihood estimation ( mle ) method suggested by cairns in @xcite @xcite to each of the models  and each starting date in the data sets above .",
    "this is done as follows : given a model with parameter vector @xmath159 and a starting date @xmath160 with available maturities @xmath65 , @xmath161 , we denote the theoretical prices by @xmath162 and the corresponding observed bond prices by @xmath163 .",
    "we then assume that @xmath164 where @xmath165 is the macaulay duration for the bond and @xmath166}{\\sigma^2_0(p)d^2b(p)+1 } , \\quad b(p)=\\frac{\\sigma_d^2}{\\sigma_0 ^ 2(p)[\\sigma_{\\infty}-\\sigma_0 ^ 2(p)]},\\ ] ] with the error parameters @xmath167 adopted in @xcite for the uk bond market data between january @xmath168 and november @xmath169 . as explained in @xcite , @xmath170 is based on the assumption that the published bond prices have rounding error of around @xmath171 per @xmath172 nominal price , whereas @xmath173 corresponds to the assumption that the difference between actual and expected yields have independent errors of the order of five basis points . finally , @xmath174 places a limit on the magnitude of price errors for long dated bonds .",
    "this leads to the log - likelihood function @xmath175+\\frac{(\\log p_{0t_i}(\\theta)-\\log\\overline{p}_{0t_i})^2}{\\nu^2(p_{0t_i}(\\theta),d_i)}\\big].\\ ] ] we then use a global search procedure to find the global maximum for the log  likelihood function , that is , to avoid finding a local maximum , we repeat the procedure using 1000 different random starting points and select the best maximization result .    having estimated the parameter vector @xmath176 , we denote by @xmath177 the fitted yield for maturity @xmath65 and by @xmath178 the corresponding observed yield .",
    "we then define the fitting root - mean - squared percentage error ( rmspe ) as @xmath179 ^ 2}.\\ ] ]    we then apply the diebold - mariano ( dm ) statistics @xcite based on rmspe to compare fitting performances as is done in @xcite and @xcite . here for the computation we use the program dmariano in the statistics package stata , with a lag order of thirteen in both of our two data sets .",
    "the null hypothesis , which is that two models have the same fitting errors , may be rejected at @xmath180 level if the absolute value of the dm statistics is greater than @xmath181 .",
    "we compare the calibration performance of the chaos models with a descriptive model for forward rates in svensson form : the higher the dm statistics , the more a chaotic model outperforms the svensson model .",
    "for option calibration , we consider one  variable second chaos models with @xmath182 as well as each of the three benchmark models described in section [ benchmark ] .    regarding the data , zero - coupon yields are bootstrapped from the libor , future and swap rates ( see @xcite for the detail of the bootstrapping technique ) and interest rate option prices from icap ( garban intercapital - london ) and ttkl ( tullett & tokyo liberty - london ) via the bloomberg database .",
    "we consider the following two data sets from the uk interest rate market :    * data between september @xmath183 and august @xmath184 at @xmath185 dates ( every friday closing mid price ) consisting of * * zero - coupon yields with 17 maturities ranging from one month to 20 years , * * implied volatilities for atm caplets with 37 maturities ranging from one to 10 years , * * implied volatilities for atm swaptions with 7 maturities ranging from one month to 5 years and 6 tenors ranging from one to 10 years .",
    "* data between may @xmath158 and may @xmath186 at @xmath185 dates ( every friday closing mid price ) consisting of * * zero - coupon yields with 22 maturities ranging from one month to 20 years . * * implied volatilities for atm caplets with 77 maturities ranging from one to 20 years , * * implied volatilities for atm swaptions with 7 maturities ranging from one month to 5 years and 6 tenors ranging from one to 10 years .",
    "note here that the option data corresponds to a part of the data in @xcite , where data was analyzed between august @xmath154 and january @xmath187 .",
    "we obtain caplet implied volatilities by bootstrapping atm cap implied volatilities observed in the market using the technique described in @xcite , where the atm caplets implied volatilities maturing at six months and nine months are obtained by constant extrapolation .",
    "the extrapolation is necessary to bootstrap the other atm caplet implied volatilities , but when we calibrate the data , the extrapolated prices give us great errors .",
    "hence , although we follow @xcite and implement the extrapolation , we do not use those two short maturities for the calibration . moreover , we observed some obvious outliers and corrected them accordingly .",
    "for each of the models and data sets above , we perform three distinct calibrations : first to yields and caplets , then to yields and swaptions , and finally to yields , caplets and swaptions . to define the objective function for each to these calibrations , denote the observed yields and prices of atm caplets and atm swaptions by @xmath178 , @xmath188 and @xmath189 , their theoretical counterparties by @xmath190 , @xmath191 and @xmath192 , and the corresponding mean square percentage errors by @xmath193 ^ 2},\\ ] ] @xmath194 ^ 2},\\ ] ] and @xmath195 ^ 2}.\\ ] ] for the calibration to yields and caplets , we then minimize the objective function @xmath196 similarly , for the calibration to yields and swaptions , we minimize the objective function @xmath197 finally , for the calibration to yields , caplets and swaptions we minimize the objective function @xmath198 for each of these calibrations , we test the pricing performance of the calibrated models . for example , after calibrating to yields and atm swaptions , we use the model to price the atm caplets and compute the pricing error from market atm caplet prices .",
    "whenever possible , for example in the hull - white model , we calibrate initial yield curves and options separately by minimizing their respective square errors , since these involve distinct sets of parameters . moreover ,",
    "for the lfm model , we minimize the square error in implied volatilities rather than actual prices .    to access the relative performance between the models , we use the akaike information criterion ( aic ) and the model selection relative frequency described in @xcite .",
    "the aic is formed with the maximized value of the likelihood function @xmath199 for an estimated model and the number of parameters @xmath8 in the following way : @xmath200 for the least squares method under the assumed normality of residuals , this reduces to .",
    "@xmath201 where rss is the fitted residual sum of squares .",
    "since @xmath202 is a constant , we ignore this term and conclude that @xmath203 to define the model selection relative frequency , let us suppose we have two models and @xmath204 calibration sets ( for example the different calibration dates in our data ) . for a data set @xmath205 we compute aic denoted @xmath206 for one model and @xmath207 for the other .",
    "suppose the aic of the first model is smaller than the aic of the other model @xmath208 times .",
    "then the model selection relative frequencies ( msrf ) for the first model and the second model are computed respectively by @xmath209"
