    "the central bulge of the milky way galaxy is the only stellar spheroid for which we can measure detailed abundances , ages and all six phase space dimensions for individual stars , as well as the luminosity function and spatial distribution for the population as a whole .",
    "some @xmath1310% of the milky way s stars are bulge stars , including a disproportionate number of the oldest and most metal - rich stars .",
    "it is therefore evident that any theory of galaxy formation and evolution is required to reproduce the observed properties of the bulge , and conversely , that the properties of the bulge should be measured as precisely and accurately as possible to best discriminate between different galaxy formation models .",
    "however , as scientifically desirable as this greater project may be , it is also difficult due to several challenges that prevent further , deeper understanding of the bulge .",
    "there are significant correlations between chemistry and kinematics , distinct chemical subgroups @xcite , gradients in metallicity , deviations from the classical picture of the triaxial ellipsoid at large separations from the minor axis , and both large @xcite and small separations from the plane .",
    "these issues necessitate larger data sets and better models .",
    "the viewing angle @xmath14 between the bulge s major axis and the sun - galactic center line of sight remains undetermined , with best - fit values ranging from from @xmath15 to @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this prevents further understanding of the inner galaxy s gravitational potential , as uncertainties in the value of @xmath14 are degenerate with those of the bulge s axis ratios @xcite and rotation speed @xcite .",
    "the most significant source of uncertainty , however , is the extinction .",
    "it averages @xmath17 toward the galactic center , suggesting @xmath18 @xcite . for most of the bulge ,",
    "values of @xmath19 are typical @xcite .",
    "the high values of reddening close to the plane render it quite difficult to obtain spectroscopic observations , proper motions , and stellar density maps .",
    "further from the plane , these can be obtained , but not fully understood due to significant zero - point uncertainties in the extinction , and indirectly , the distance .",
    "a further complication arises from the fact the extinction toward the inner galaxy is not only large but also non - standard .",
    "this was first suggested by @xcite as a solution to the anomalous colors of bulge rr lyrae @xcite and red clump ( rc ) stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite were the first to demonstrate that the reddening law toward the inner galaxy is described by smaller total - to - selective ratios than the `` standard '' values measured for the local interstellar medium , implying a steeper extinction curve and thus a smaller characteristic size for dust grains .",
    "@xcite measured @xmath20 ( denoted @xmath21 in that work ) toward several bulge fields , much smaller than the value of @xmath22 suggested by the standard interstellar extinction curve of @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that applying the same methodology to observations of the large magellanic cloud taken with the same instruments yielded @xmath24 , the standard value , demonstrating the robustness of the result .",
    "further , not only was the reddening law toward the bulge found to be non - standard , it was also found to be rapidly varying between sightlines , with values of @xmath25 ranging from @xmath26 to @xmath27 .",
    "the steeper extinction law toward the inner galaxy has been subsequently confirmed with observations using _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ optical filters by , by analysis of rr lyrae stars in ogle - iii @xcite , and also in the near - ir .",
    "meanwhile , @xcite and @xcite both found that the extinction law toward the inner galaxy was _ shallower _ ( greyer ) in the mid - ir .",
    "the variations in both the extinction and the extinction law made it difficult to reliably trace the spatial structure of the bulge @xcite . applying the @xmath0 extinction maps of @xcite to the bulge color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) implied a distance to the galactic center of @xmath139 kpc , a large value relative to the geometrically determined distances to the galactic center of @xmath28 kpc @xcite , @xmath29 kpc @xcite , and @xmath30 kpc @xcite .",
    "as the structure of the inner galaxy is a very sensitive probe of the environmental conditions in which the galaxy formed and evolved @xcite , an accurate spatial determination of the bulge s morphology would yield a powerful test of galaxy formation models .",
    "moreover , investigations of the metallicity distribution function of bulge giants have had to rely on imprecise and potentially inaccurate estimates of surface gravity and photometric temperature , further reducing our ability to probe the primordial conditions of the galaxy .",
    "we resolve these issues in this investigation by combining ogle - iii observations in @xmath31 and @xmath32 with @xmath1 and 2mass measurements of @xmath2 .",
    "we confirm previous findings that the @xmath0 extinction toward the inner galaxy is steeper than standard , but also show that it is a little less steep than previously assumed .",
    "we show that this is likely due to an effect we label `` composite extinction bias '' , which makes it unphysical to extrapolate a slope of @xmath25 to @xmath33 .",
    "our parameterization for the extinction , @xmath3 , is less sensitive to the rapid variations in the extinction law than the computation of slopes @xmath25 . whereas the latter must be computed from an ensemble of measurements spread across 30@xmath7 or more , the former can be directly measured for each @xmath34 sightline .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "we summarize the data used in section [ sec : data ] .",
    "our methodology for measuring the parameters of the rc is described in section [ sec : rcmeasurements ] , and we derive the intrinsic rc luminosity parameters in section [ sec : calibration ] .",
    "we briefly state the properties of reddening that would be expected using a standard reddening curve in section [ sec : reddeningtheory ] .",
    "the reddening measurements are presented and discussed in section [ sec : reddening ] , including comparisons to the reddening maps of schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( sfd , @xcite ) and the derivation of an empirical rule to estimate differential reddening .",
    "methods to convert the reddening into an extinction using a single color are demonstrated to inevitably fail in section [ sec : reddeninglawestimates ] , and a more successful extinction law is derived in section [ sec : rjkvi ] by including information from both @xmath35 and @xmath2 .",
    "we demonstrate that reddening constraints from macho photometry may have been misinterpreted in section [ sec : macho ] . in section [ sec : galacticstructure ] , we show that our dereddened apparent magnitudes suggest a distance to the galactic center @xmath36 kpc , and a tilt between the galactic bulge s major axis and the sun - galactic center line of sight no greater than @xmath37 .",
    "we translate these measurements into constraints for microlensing events toward the bulge in section [ sec : microlensingconstraint ] .",
    "we analyze our number counts for the rc in section [ sec : galacticstructure2 ] and show that combining these with the assumptions of standard stellar evolution and a salpeter imf yields an estimated galactic bulge stellar mass of @xmath38 .",

    "ogle - iii observations were taken with the 1.3 meter warsaw telescope , located at the las campanas observatory .",
    "the camera has eight 2048x4096 detectors , with a combined field of view of @xmath39 yielding a scale of approximately 0.26@xmath40/pixel .",
    "we use observations from 263 of the 267 ogle - iii fields directed toward the galactic bulge , which are almost entirely within the range @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we do not use 4 of the fields , blg200 , 201 , 202 , and 203 ; located toward @xmath43 , due to the much higher differential reddening and disk contamination toward those sightlines . the photometric coverage used in this work",
    "is shown in figure [ fig : ogle3-blg - fields ] .",
    "of the 263 fields used , 37 are toward northern latitudes .",
    "more detailed descriptions of the instrumentation , photometric reductions and astrometric calibrations are available in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "ogle - iii photometry is available for download from the ogle webpage .",
    "we also make use of data from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass , @xcite ) , which we calibrate on the measurements of , who used data from the vista variables in the via lactea survey ( vvv , ) . the calibration is discussed in section [ subsec : jmk2mass ] .",
    "the rc is a prominent , well - populated , and localized feature of galactic bulge cmds @xcite , of which we show two examples in figure [ fig : markovscript17paper ] .",
    "the color , color - dispersion , apparent magnitude , magnitude dispersion and normalization of the rc vary from sightline to sightline , rendering it a sensitive probe of the reddening toward the bulge , its distance , and its underlying structure .",
    "we measure these properties across the ogle - iii bulge sky in the following manner .",
    "each of 2,104 ogle - iii subfields ( eight detectors over 263 fields ) used in this work was split into 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 15 or 21 rectangles .",
    "smaller rectangles were used toward regions of the sky where the surface density of stars was higher .",
    "our average rectangle size is @xmath44 .",
    "the total number of sightlines is 9,744 , though for most of this work we only make use of 9,014 of those sightlines that are no nearer than 7@xmath7 or 3 half - light radii to a known galactic globular cluster , that satisfy our photometric completeness criteria of @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and that are not flagged as being highly differentially reddened , or otherwise problematic .",
    "we publish the best - fit parameter values for the remaining sightlines but do not incorporate them in our analysis .",
    "the complexity of bulge cmds requires that we be careful before fitting a luminosity function .",
    "the typical limits to the color - magnitude selection box are given by : @xmath47 @xmath48 the purpose of the color - magnitude selection is to select as many bulge giants as possible without selecting too many foreground stars , which populate a sequence of stars @xmath130.6 mag bluer than the rc at the brightness of the rc , but that merges with the bulge red giant ( rg ) branch at a luminosity @xmath132 mag fainter than the rc @xcite .",
    "the color range is therefore adjusted when the foreground main - sequence stars either have very similar or very distinct colors from the bulge rg branch .",
    "the standard methodology for investigations of the rc toward various stellar systems is the paczynski - stanek equation @xcite : @xmath49,\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the number of stars at magnitude @xmath32 in an interval of length @xmath51 , the gaussian parameters @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 measure the mean magnitude , magnitude dispersion , and number of rc stars , and a quadratic polynomial is fit for the underlying luminosity function of red giant ( rg ) stars .",
    "though the broad application of the paczynski - stanek equation demonstrates its versatility , we modify it to enhance our accuracy and precision .    as in some previous works @xcite",
    ", we fit the luminosity function of the rg branch to a 2-parameter exponential rather than a 3-parameter quadratic .",
    "the reduced number of free parameters makes the fitting routine more stable .",
    "we found that fitting a quadratic to the rg branch can lead to catastrophic errors .",
    "that is because for large values of @xmath53 , the gaussian becomes degenerate with the quadratic term , leading to even larger values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 at the expense of an unphysical , negative normalization to the rg branch .",
    "the exponential satisfies the physically - motivated condition of being both a strictly positive and strictly increasing function of magnitude , which stabilizes it .",
    "it is also sound theoretically , as stellar models actually predict an exponential distribution to the magnitudes of rg stars outside the red giant branch bump ( rgbb ) .",
    "we also accounted for the rgbb and asymptotic giant branch bump ( agbb ) .",
    "we parameterized the luminosity function as follows : @xmath55 +    \\frac{n_{rc}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma_{rc}}\\exp \\biggl[{-\\frac{(i - i_{rc})^2}{2\\sigma_{rc}^2}}\\biggl ]   + \\nonumber",

    "we contrast two cmds in figure [ fig : markovscript17paper ] specifically selected to demonstrate the effects of reddening and extinction . in figure",

    "shown in the left panel .",
    "the best - fit values of the color and magnitude of the rc , the magnitude dispersion and the color dispersion are shown on the top - left of the left panel .",
    "the color - magnitude selection is denoted by the thick black lines .",
    "the magnitude histogram of stars in the color - magnitude selection box is shown to the right of the cmd , on the same scale to the vertical axis , along with a model fit for the rg , rc+rg and total rg+rgbb+rc+agbb .",
    "the parameter values for the rgbb and agbb is measured in @xcite ]      the color of the rc is first assumed to be that of the nearest of 92,000 values of @xmath62 measured for the study of @xcite .",
    "the measurement of @xmath62 is then slightly adjusted in this work .",
    "we start with the old value , and then measure the position of the rc in @xmath32 by fitting equation [ eq : exponential ] .",
    "two colors are subsequently fit for , one for the rc , and one for the position of the foreground disk component at the brightness of the rc ( typically @xmath130.6 mag bluer than the rc ) , easily discernible in figures [ fig : markovscript17paper ] and [ fig : markovscript17paper2 ] .",
    "every star in the cmd is then assigned to the closer of these two colors , and the two colors selected are those that minimize the weighted variance of the difference between the colors of stars and the nearest of the two trial colors ( rc and foreground disk component ) , where the weights @xmath63 are given by : @xmath64}{a\\exp\\biggl[b(i - i_{rc})\\biggl ] +   \\frac{n_{rc}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma_{rc}}\\exp \\biggl[{-\\frac{(i - i_{rc})^2}{2\\sigma_{rc}^2}}\\biggl ]   } , \\ ] ] and thus in practice only stars satisfying @xmath65 contribute to the fit to the color and color - dispersion .",
    "we recursively removed 2.5@xmath66 outliers from the fit to @xmath62 .",
    "the values of the color @xmath62 and color - dispersion @xmath67 are adopted once no outliers remain . if the resulting color disagrees with the color first assumed by 0.03 mag or more , we redo the fit to the magnitude distribution and subsequently to the color with an updated color - magnitude selection box , so that the number of stars bluer than the rc included in the fit is independent of any potentially incorrect initial guess of the rc colour .",
    "if the fit fails to converge after 5 iterations , the 0.03 mag condition is relaxed , and the sightline is flagged as problematic and not incorporated within any of our analysis .",

    "we understand that many readers will be skeptical about this point ",
    "it is not unreasonable to look at the line fits in figure [ fig : localreddening3mosaic2 ] , to see how well they go through the points , and to conclude `` that has to be extinction law '' .",
    "we dedicate the following subsection to the requirement of providing a heuristic explanation to this phenomenon .",
    "the extinction law is a variable function of direction .",

    "it logically follows from equation [ eq : trueextinction ] that the true extinction law for a given sightline will be an average weighted by the total reddening contributed from each type of interstellar medium and corresponding dust properties intersecting the line of sight .",
    "the slope @xmath25 has historically been estimated by measuring the functional dependence of the variation in extinction on the variation in reddening .",

    "consider a two - point regression , measured from rc centroids that are 30@xmath7 apart on the sky . at a distance of 1 kpc ,",
    "the two sightlines will be @xmath138 pc apart . at a distance of 4 kpc",
    ", the two sightlines will be @xmath1330 pc apart . the difference in extinction between sightlines towards the bulge",
    "will therefore be statistically biased toward whichever kind of dust is to be found deeper into the inner galaxy , as distinct sightlines diverge linearly with distance .",
    "@xmath25 is a weighted average of different extinction laws , but the weights are not the same weights as those which go into equation [ eq : trueextinction ] .",
    "the name we assign to this phenomenon is `` composite extinction bias '' : the functional dependence of the variation in extinction on the variation in reddening is biased toward the kind of extinction which contributes differentially to different sightlines",
    ". a class of extinction that contributes equally to both sightlines will obviously contribute to the true value of @xmath237 of both sightlines , but it will not contribute to the scatter in @xmath238 and @xmath35 , and thus not to @xmath25 . though we discuss the bulge here , we expect that the same phenomenon may apply in any direction where the extinction law varies along the line of sight .",
    "vs @xmath62 near two sightlines .",
    "the measured reddening laws @xmath25 are clearly different , but extrapolating the reddening laws back to @xmath33 leads to an unphysical difference in the value of @xmath239 mag .",

    "we show the derivations of @xmath25 for two different directions in figure [ fig : localreddening3mosaicb ] .",
    "these two fits yield different values of @xmath25 , and values of @xmath222 that differ by 0.24@xmath2400.03 mag .",
    "these two directions are at the same longitude , so the galactic bulge s orientation should affect both directions equally , and thus the difference in @xmath241 can not be due to a difference in distance modulus , as for a mean distance to the bulge of 8.2 kpc ( estimated later in this work ) , this offset implies a distance difference of @xmath13900 pc , some @xmath242 larger than would be expected from latitude - dependent projection effects .",
    "it also can not plausibly be due to a difference in absolute magnitude , as rc stars have a metallicity - dependence of @xmath130.2 mag dex@xmath119 in @xmath32 @xcite , whereas from equation [ eq : colorterms3 ] and as such an unphysical mean metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath243 + 1.20 would be required to understand the different intercept .",
    "the difference of 0.24@xmath2400.03 mag is thus seemingly unphysical , but it directly follows from extrapolating the fits in figure [ fig : localreddening3mosaicb ] to @xmath33 .",
    "we thus conclude that the fits should not be extrapolated back to @xmath33 .",
    "there is a component of the extinction that contributes to the extinction of these sightlines , but much less strongly to the scatter of their extinctions .",
    "we are thus left with a dilemma .",
    "we have demonstrated that @xmath244 , yet the correlations found in section [ subsec : singlereddening ] demonstrate that it has some physical meaning . there is no obvious way to probe any screen of extinction that would contribute equally to neighboring sightlines without making use of problematic assumptions as to the intrinsic values of distance modulus .",
    "we conclude that the conversion from reddening to extinction can not be done accurately with a single reddening value .",
    "the solution we propose is to utilize multiple reddening values , in different bandpasses .",
    "for each of our sightlines with a measured rc centroid we add a measurement of @xmath2 , in the manner described in section [ subsec : jmk2mass ] .",
    "we thus have two completely independent reddening measurements for every sightline : @xmath35 and @xmath2 .",

    "further from the minor axis , a reassuring similarity is observed between figure [ fig : rijkmapper ] and the bottom panel of figure [ fig : mapper17d4paper4maps2 ] .",
    "both have ( relatively ) more standard extinction further from the galactic minor axis , toward approximately the same directions of @xmath248 .",

    "the first is that the ratio of two reddenings can be taken toward both single - rc and double - rc sightlines , as double - rcs do not differ in color @xcite .",
    "the second advantage is more fundamental : whereas the measurement of slopes @xmath25 must be done over @xmath1330@xmath7 scales to be precise , independent values of @xmath174 can be measured for each sightline , giving us very sharp resolution on the extinction law .",
    "the fact each of 9,014 measurements shown in figure [ fig : rijkmapper ] is independent of the other measurements confirms that the variations in the extinction law are real : if the variations were due to noise , they would not cluster together .    .",

    "it may be that the exponential slope of the near - ir extinction law rises to higher values for lower values of @xmath161 . @xcite and",
    "@xcite would not have been able to measure this , as none of their 51 sightlines probed values of @xmath161 as low as the mean value toward the bulge inferred in this work .",

    "we note that studies of the extinction in the hosts of type ia sne routinely find an @xmath5 extinction curve , and then subsequently assume the functional dependence on wavelength calibrated in investigations of milky way extinction .",
    "if that functional form were modified , it would have significant implications not just for galactic studies , but also for cosmology .",

    "the spectroscopic metallicity distribution function of the galactic bulge is now known to an impressive degree of accuracy .",

    "the difference can lead to a bias of @xmath1350% in the inferred viewing angle of the galactic bulge , and depends on the bulge s axis ratios .",
