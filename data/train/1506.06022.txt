    "increasing @xmath6 is a challenging task due to the interdependency of transport coefficients . in particular ,",
    "the electrical conductivity and the electronic contribution to the thermal conductivity are related by the wiedemann - franz law  @xcite , which , follows at low enough temperatures from the single - particle fermi liquid theory , states that the ratio @xmath7 is constant .",

    "this method has been successfully applied to the one - dimensional ( 1d ) dimerized gas of interacting hard - point particles  @xcite . in that model , due to the fact that particles only interact via instantaneous collisions , the particles in the reservoirs are in effect decoupled from those of the system .",
    "as such the reservoirs can be modeled as ideal gases so that the simulations can be facilitated greatly ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the detailed description of the algorithm ) .",
    "however , in more general systems with realistic interaction , the coupling between the reservoirs and the system is essential ; the mere injection of particles from an ideal gas into the system may induce huge , unphysical interaction energy when an injected particle is too close to a system particle .    given this difficulty , which is unsolved yet to the best of our knowledge",
    ", we turn to the closed heat baths  @xcite that only exchange heat with the system .",
    "we sandwich the system with two closed heat baths at different temperatures to establish a nonequilibrium setup . for interacting systems , the heat conductivity can be computed directly with this setup , but computing thermopower is challenging . in this paper , we solve this problem by the following steps : we first use the grand - canonical monte carlo method  @xcite to compute the electrochemical potential , @xmath8 , as a function of the particle density , @xmath9 , at a given temperature ; then , with our nonequilibrium setup and by molecular dynamics , we compute the density difference @xmath10 across the system , set in response to the temperature difference @xmath11 applied to the system . finally , based on the established relation between @xmath8 and @xmath9 , we map the density difference into the thermoelectric voltage difference , @xmath12 , so that the thermopower is computed as @xmath13 . as to the electrical conductivity @xmath3 , due to the fact that closed heat baths do not support a charge current , it can not be computed numerically with our nonequilibrium setup ; however , it can be computed in equilibrium simulations by using the green - kubo formula  @xcite .    to test and illustrate the method for computing the thermopower in nonequlibrium simulations , we first consider the 1d dimerized hard - point gas model @xcite .",

    "this result , so far illustrated by means of toy models  @xcite , is here confirmed in a more realistic model .",
