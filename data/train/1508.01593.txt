    "during the last decade , the kepler space mission and other transit , radial velocity surveys , microlensing , and imaging surveys , resulted in the discovery of thousands of exoplanets and exoplanet candidates ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , demonstrating that exoplanets in the galactic field are common .",
    "combined with new developments in computational astrophysics , the prospects for deepening our understanding of the formation and dynamical evolution of exoplanets are promising .",
    "in contrast to the large number of exoplanets found in the solar neighborhood , only a handfull of exoplanets have been detected in open clusters , such as hyades @xcite , m37 @xcite , ngc2158 @xcite , ngc7789 @xcite , ngc1245 @xcite and ngc7068 @xcite , and in globular clusters , such as @xmath10  centauri @xcite , 47  tucanae @xcite , ngc6378 @xcite and ngc6791 @xcite .",
    "although the study of @xcite suggests that the planet frequency in open clusters is similar to that in the field , statistically stronger observational evidence is necessary strengthen this argument .",

    "in such dense stellar environments , close encounters between planetary systems and the stellar populations surrounding them can result in orbital reconfiguration or decay of planetary systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and in the subsequent production of free - floating planets .",
    "although free - floating planets are expected to be common in young star clusters and in the galactic field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the currently known planetary systems and free - floating planets are unlikely to have formed at the places where they are found today , and the orbital properties of these planetary systems may have been affected by their internal dynamical evolution and by gravitational interactions with the environment in which they were born . to understand the observed orbital properties of exoplanets , it is necessary to consider the dynamical evolution these systems have undergone since their formation , prior to , during , and after the dynamical process that led to the escape of these planetary systems from their natal environment .",

    "the dynamical age of the star clusters at @xmath12  myr is thus proportional to @xmath95 and is independent of @xmath82 .",
    "finally , the tidal radius ( eq .  [ eq : tidalradius ] ) of a cluster scales as @xmath96 , and is also independent of @xmath82 .    to understand dependence on the initial density in fig .",
    "[ fig : f_n ] , it is convenient to first consider the evolution of the stellar population alone , and ignore the presence of planets , which have a negligible effect on the stellar dynamics . clusters with a given @xmath74 are all evolved for an identical number of relaxation times , despite the different stellar densities .",
    "the only relevant difference between the clusters is the tidal radius , more specifically the ratio @xmath97 .",
    "clusters with a larger initial density are more compact , and it therefore takes longer for bpss and single stars to escape while the clusters gradually expand to fill their tidal radii .",
    "consequently , clusters with larger @xmath82 have a larger number of bound stars , after an identical number of dynamical times have elapsed . larger densities , however , do result in the destruction of more planetary systems , and therefore exhibit a larger fraction of bfps and efps at 50  myr .",

    "@xmath1 on both the stellar density , and the binding energy of the star cluster .",
    "the former is related to the strength and frequency of close encounters , so for the two different star density cases , it is reasonable to see that when a cluster has a higher initial density , it has smaller @xmath1 at @xmath12  myr . due to the low cluster masses ,",
    "many of the liberated planets are ejected from their host stars with velocities above the cluster s escape velocity , and therefore @xmath11 is close to zero and @xmath73 is positive ( apart from the higher - mass clusters that can retain free - floating planets ) . planetary systems escaping the cluster intact are most common among the lowest - mass clusters that experience near - dissolution around @xmath12  myr .",
    "although many surveys have focused on detecting planets in open and globular clusters , relatively few planets orbiting stars and free - floating planets have been discovered in these environments .",
    "this can partially be attributed to observational difficulties , but also to disruption following close encounters with neighbouring stars and subsequent escape of free - floating planets from star clusters .",
    "inspired by the earlier study of @xcite we carry out @xmath0-body simulations of evolving star clusters . we employ the ` nbody6 ` package to model open star cluster environments with @xmath78 stars , in which we assign each star a jupiter - mass companion .",
    "all planets initially have circular and randomly oriented orbits .",
    "we evolve all clusters for 50  myr and study how the evolution of the planetary population depends on the initial conditions .",
    "we study star clusters with different initial amounts of substructure ( @xmath98 ) , different initial virial ratios ( @xmath99 ) and initial planetary semi - major axes in the range 1  au@xmath100  au . to broaden the applicability of our results , we also carry out simulations of star clusters with different total masses and stellar densities .",
    "our main results can be summarised as follows :    1 .",
    "the initial values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 mostly affect the evolution of planetary systems during the first @xmath20  myr , which is the time at which the initial substructure is removed and virial equilibrium is achieved .",
    "subsequently , the stellar and planetary populations evolve gradually , more or less independent of the initial conditions .",
    "although the initial choices for @xmath34 and @xmath35 take effect at early times , their influence on the fate of planetary systems can be substantial .",
    "the amount of disruption of planetary systems and escape of free - floating planets is larger when a star cluster is initialised with a larger amount of substructure or is further away from virial equilibrium .",
    "although both play a role in the disruption rate of planetary systems and the escape rate of planetary systems from the star cluster , the initial amount of substructure , @xmath34 , mostly affects the former , while the initial virial state , @xmath35 , has most influence on the latter .",
    "3 .   in addition to environmental factors ,",
    "the disruption rate of planetary systems is strongly correlated with initial semi - major axis @xmath19 .",
    "the fractions of bound planetary systems @xmath24 and bound free - floating planets @xmath25 are well - described by the functional form @xmath101 , where @xmath33 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are constants . in the case of @xmath1 , @xmath33 represents the fraction of stars that remains bound the cluster , @xmath4 is the stability limit for disruption of planetary systems , and @xmath5 measures the width of the transition region , which is negative for @xmath24 and positive for @xmath25 .",
    "a higher degree of initial substructure in the star clusters results in a higher disruption rate of planetary systems .",
    "the fraction of bound planetary systems over time is well approximated with @xmath102 , where @xmath8 is an almost linear function of time ( eq .

    "5 .   for clusters with a fixed initial density ,",
    "the fraction of planetary systems present at @xmath12  myr increases with increasing cluster mass , while the fraction of escaping free - floating planets decreases .",
    "crowded environments result in more frequent encounters , so more free - floating planets are generated in the high - density centre of the cluster , and fewer intact planetary systems are ejected from the star cluster .",
    "our study has focused on the general dynamical evolution of star - planet systems and free - floating planets in star clusters .",
    "our models represent a simplification of reality , as we have exclusively modelled single - planet systems .",
    "multi - planet systems are substantially more fragile than single - planet systems .",
    "small perturbation of an outer planet can induce strong gravitational interactions with other planet(s ) in the system , which may result in a reconfiguration of the system , in the ejection of one or more planets , or in a physical star - planet or planet - planet collision ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
