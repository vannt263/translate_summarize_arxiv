    "( [ eq : xqbeta ] ) varies as a function of the oscillation parameters .",
    "note that this quantity does _ not _ depend on the actually observed data ; it characterises the properties of the statistical method applied to the specific experimental setup .",
    "for definiteness i consider the least - squares method , for which contours of constant @xmath74 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta_fc ] for @xmath77 and @xmath78  cl . in the left panel of that figure",
    "one can see that the contour for @xmath79 , which corresponds to the @xmath0-distribution for 95% cl , happens to be rather close to the 95% cl region from the @xmath0-cut approximation .",
    "this explains the good agreement observed in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fc_regions_chi2 ] .",
    "furthermore , one finds from fig .",
    "[ fig : delta_fc ] that @xmath74 decreases for small values of @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the reason for this behaviour can be understood as follows : if @xmath80 becomes @xmath82 and/or @xmath83  ev@xmath39 the effect of oscillations gets very small , and the signal in kamland corresponds roughly to the no - oscillation case .",
    "analysing data generated from parameters in that region leads to best fit points also in the no - oscillation region , with a rather similar @xmath50 .",
    "hence , the distribution of @xmath55 is more peaked at low values , which implies relatively small values of @xmath74 .",
    "this explains the tendency of more constraining exact confidence regions for small values of @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the physical reason for this behaviour is that even with the present kamland data sample no - disappearance can be very well distinguished from oscillations with @xmath84 and @xmath85  ev@xmath39 .",
    "moreover , in the region of small @xmath80 or @xmath81 the full 2-parameter dependence of the survival probability is lost , and the effective number of degrees of freedom is reduced , leading to smaller values of @xmath74 .",
    "the reason why for the likelihood method the agreement is better for higher cl than for the least - squares method can be partially attributed to the fact that for the latter the approximate regions extend to smaller values of @xmath80 , which implies smaller values of @xmath74 and larger disagreement with the @xmath0-approximation .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath86 and @xmath87  ev@xmath39 the simulation yields relatively higher values of @xmath74 . in that region oscillations are important .",
    "however , because of the rather small data sample the signature of given parameters can not be identified with sufficiently high significance .",
    "this implies that statistical fluctuations can lead easily to best fit points in a different local minimum . in other words , when data are generated by given parameters in that region , fluctuations can mimic a signal which is better fitted by quite different parameters .",
    "hence , the best fit points are stronger affected by fluctuations , resulting into a broader distribution of @xmath55 and larger values of @xmath74 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : delta_fc ] one observes that the approximate confidence regions at 68.3% cl are well inside the high @xmath74 regime .",
    "this explains the weaker constraints from exact allowed regions for low confidence levels in fig .",
    "[ fig : fc_regions_chi2 ] .",
    "note , however , that in the region around @xmath88  ev@xmath39 , where kamland is most sensitive to oscillations , the @xmath74 values decrease again .",
    "this shows that in that region kamland can well identify the parameters , leading already to statistical properties close to the expected @xmath0-distribution .",
    "therefore , around the best fit point exact and approximate confidence regions are in good agreement .    the main conclusion to be drawn from figs .",
    "[ fig : fc_regions_lh ] and [ fig : fc_regions_chi2 ] is that already using the current 54 events from kamland the approximate @xmath0-cut method gives a rather reliable determination of allowed regions .",
    "the small quantitative differences to exact confidence regions can be understood by considering the impact of statistical fluctuations on the fit .",
    "one may expect that once more data will have been collected the differences will further decrease , because statistical fluctuations will be less important .",
    "furthermore , if the true oscillation parameters happen to be close to the present best fit region around @xmath89  ev@xmath39 and large @xmath80 a rather clear oscillation signal can be observed in kamland . in that case",
    "the impact of other local minima will become small and one may expect that @xmath55 will follow a distribution rather close to the @xmath0-distribution .",
    "because of the limited statistics of the current kamland data sample the data is consistent with an energy independent suppression of the reactor neutrino flux  @xcite . this is evident , since allowed regions appear for large @xmath9 , corresponding to energy averaged oscillations .",
    "however , even this first data set indicates some spectral distortion which is consistent with neutrino oscillations . in this section the statistical significance for an oscillatory signal is quantified by using a so - called decoherence parameter . the survival probability for the electron anti - neutrinos",
    "is modified ( in a rather arbitrary way ) by multiplying the quantum mechanical interference term which leads to the oscillatory behaviour by a factor @xmath90 : @xmath91 \\,.\\ ] ] restricting @xmath92 to the interval @xmath93 $ ] one can describe in a model independent way a loss of quantum mechanical coherence due to some unspecified mechanism .",
    "@xmath94 corresponds to standard quantum mechanics , whereas @xmath95 describes complete decoherence , _",
    "i.e. _ , an energy and baseline independent suppression of the flux . ) has been used in ref .",
    "@xcite to investigate the evidence for quantum mechanical interference in the @xmath96 and @xmath97 systems . ]     as a function of the decoherence parameter @xmath92 for the likelihood and the least - squares method . ]",
    "now the data is analysed as a function of the three parameters @xmath98 and @xmath92 .",
    "the @xmath55 marginalised with respect to @xmath9 and @xmath8 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : decoherence ] for the likelihood and the least - squares method . a clear indication in favour of oscillations is observed .",
    "complete decoherence is disfavoured with @xmath99 using the likelihood method and @xmath100 by the least - squares method .",
    "this confirms that the likelihood method is a more powerful tool to extract spectral information from the data , in agreement with the results of sec .",
    "[ sec : kl_analyses ] . assuming that @xmath101 is distributed as a @xmath0 with 1 degree of freedom i conclude that the current kamland data provides a @xmath1 indication in favour of neutrino oscillations , implying quantum mechanical interference over distances of the order of 200  km .",
    "depending on the true values of the oscillation parameters one may expect that the statistical significance for oscillations in kamland will strongly improve by future data .",
    "a simple rescaling of the current data by a factor 5 leads to an exclusion of complete decoherence at @xmath102 if the true value of @xmath9 turns out to be @xmath103  ev@xmath39 . on the other hand",
    "if @xmath104  ev@xmath39 decoherence can be excluded only at @xmath105 , since for large @xmath9 the baselines in kamland are too long to be sensitive to the oscillations .",
    "in this letter two different analysis methods for the first data from the kamland reactor neutrino experiment have been compared .",
    "i found that an event - by - event based likelihood method provides a more powerful tool to extract information on two - neutrino oscillation parameters than a least - squares method based on energy binned data .",
    "the likelihood method takes into account the precise energy information contained in each single event and avoids the information loss due to binning .",
    "furthermore , exact frequentist confidence regions in the parameter space have been calculated by means of monte carlo simulation according to the feldman - cousins method  @xcite .",
    "this method properly accounts for the non - linearity of the oscillation parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and statistical fluctuations in the data , which can be quite large due to the rather small number of events in the current data sample .",
    "i have found a reasonable agreement of the exact confidence regions with the ones obtained from the @xmath0-cut approximation , especially in the vicinity of the best point at @xmath73  ev@xmath39 .",
    "however , depending on the analysis method ( likelihood or least - squares ) quantitative differences are visible , especially for lower confidence levels and far from the best fit point . finally ,",
    "although the current data is consistent with an energy independent flux suppression , a @xmath1 indication in favour of oscillations can be stated using the likelihood method , which is especially sensitive to the spectral shape information . put in other words , this implies a @xmath1 evidence for quantum mechanical interference over distances of the order of 200  km .    in summary , the results obtained in this work confirm that even for the limited statistics of the current kamland data sample the @xmath0-cut approximation to calculate confidence regions for the oscillation parameters gives rather reliable results .",
    "one expects that in future the agreement between approximate and exact confidence regions will improve due to increase in statistics .",
