    "we are confronted by an apparent discrepancy of about three standard deviations between the average @xmath3 from ultracold neutron ( ucn ) storage experiments and the @xmath3 from cold neutron beam experiments .",
    "it is the leading source of uncertainty in predictions of the primordial abundance of @xmath6he @xcite . for reviews of @xmath3 experiments",

    "should , in principle , experience no losses other than @xmath4-decay , provided that depolarization , i.e.  the non - adiabatic transition to the non - storable spin state , is sufficiently suppressed . in most existing and proposed magnetic trap systems the low - field seeking state with spin parallel to the magnetic field is being stored and a spin - flip transition to the anti - parallel state results in a loss by escape from the bottle or by interaction with the bottle walls .    until recently ,",
    "ucn depolarization estimates @xcite have been based on majorana s quasi - classical result @xcite for a particle with spin moving with constant velocity vector through an infinitely extended non - uniform magnetic field of specific form . for field parameters as currently used for magnetic ucn storage the probability @xmath7 of a spin flip away from the field direction would be of order @xmath8 , thus immeasurably small .",
    "walstrom @xmath0 @xcite , in 2009 , pointed out that the values of @xmath7 for confined , rather than freely moving , neutrons are much larger . for a particular vertical path in the field of the los alamos gravito - magnetic ucn trap they calculated @xmath9 , which is much larger than the majorana estimate but still negligible in any actual or projected neutron lifetime experiment .",
    "in @xcite we extended this theory to general orbits with both vertical and horizontal velocity components , using the model of an ideal halbach magnetic field @xmath10 where the magnitude @xmath11 only depends on the vertical position .",
    "we found that the lateral motion in the plane where the halbach field rotates is of critical importance .",
    "taking it into account increases the spin - flip loss thus calculated by some 10 orders of magnitude to @xmath12 for a field minimum ( holding field ) of @xmath13 mt .",
    "this translates into a spin - flip loss rate that is a fraction @xmath14 of the @xmath4-decay rate and decreasing rapidly with larger holding field .",
    "the analysis in @xcite is based on the following concepts : for the one - dimensional ( 1d ) field model of @xcite , the potential @xmath15 for the high - field repelled @xmath16 spin state of a neutron with mass @xmath17 and negative magnetic moment @xmath18 nev / t depends only on the vertical @xmath19 coordinate . in this model",

    "it may change over many orders of magnitude @xcite , peaking at critical points where the field magnitude @xmath11 is small and the vector @xmath10 rotates rapidly in the reference frame of the moving particle .",
    "the spin flip probability is `` measured '' only at the next tp where , in the copenhagen interpretation , the wave function collapses and ucns in the @xmath16 state return to the trapping region while the @xmath28 projection separates in space and quickly becomes lost .",
    "conceptually , the `` measurement '' could be made by an ideal neutron detector placed just next to the tp , which would intersect the ucns in the `` wrong '' spin state as they exit the storage space .",
    "this  measurement resets the ucn wave function to a pure initial @xmath16 state for the next lap where the sequence of wave evolution and collapse at the following tp is repeated .",
    "in the present article we extend this approach to the analysis of depolarization in cylindrical multipole fields such as those described in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the trapping fields are generated by halbach arrays of permanent magnets @xcite or , for @xcite and , earlier @xcite , by superconducting currents . for these cylindrical configurations we use a 2d field model which enables us to obtain a semi - analytic expression for the ensemble - averaged spin - flip loss and which can be analyzed with no need to involve simulations .",

    "we have performed 3d simulations including gravity both for the vertical and the horizontal cylindrical multipole configurations .    as a second application",
    "we extend the previous analysis @xcite of depolarization for a 1d field model of the los alamos ucn@xmath2 trap @xcite to the actual field in this magneto - gravitational trap with its asymmetrically double - curved wall in the shape of a bowl . as in @xcite",
    "we approximate the field for the curved arrays of permanent magnets by that of the corresponding infinite planar array tangent to the bowl surface at the closest point on the bowl surface .",

    "( 5 ) of @xcite ] , `` one - way ripple '' [ eq .  ( 7 ) ] and `` two - way ripple '' [ eq .",
    "the `` one - way ripple '' takes into account the finite magnet size and the `` two - way ripple '' also includes the effect of iron shims between the magnets , a design feature not implemented for the current ucn@xmath2 system ( status of 2016 ) .",
    "the theoretical approach is outlined in sec .",
    "[ sec : iii ] , where we derive a first - order approximation to the spin - flip probability from the spin - dependent schrdinger equation ( se ) , and in sec .",

    "[ sec : v ] we derive a higher - order solution of the spin - dependent se and show that it deviates very little from the first - order approximation .",
    "these various approaches are semi - classical since the field @xmath39 acting on the neutron spin is determined by the classical motion of the particle through the field .",
    "however , the results have been shown @xcite to be consistent also with a fully quantum mechanical analysis starting from the spin and space dependent se .",

    ", we use the wentzel - kramers - brillouin ( wkb ) approximation @xcite to solve the se .",
    "this is justified since the spatial variation of field variables is much slower than the variation of the ucn wave function .",
    "the scales are of order cm for gravity and @xmath10 , and of order @xmath40 m or less for the wavelength .",
    "thus the wave function for spin state @xmath16 can be expressed in the wkb form except at a tp @xmath41 , where its amplitude @xmath42 diverges since the wave number @xmath43 vanishes .",

    ". thus we use the se for spin 1/2 with quantization axis in the local field direction , as in @xcite : @xmath46 where @xmath47 are the spinors aligned in the direction of or opposite to the local magnetic field @xmath10 , respectively . for",

    "we determine the spin - flip rate between consecutive tps at @xmath81 and @xmath82 by dividing @xmath83 , from ( [ 10 ] ) , by the time interval @xmath84 . taking into account the probability @xmath85 of finding the particle on this path element",
    "the spin - flip rate for the entire path becomes @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the number of tps encountered . finally , the depolarization rate measured in the experiments is the ensemble average over all paths , which is determined by the source characteristics and by spectral cleaning .",
    "we assume an isotropic maxwell spectrum , thus an energy independent phase space density ( psd ) .",
    "the boltzmann factor @xmath88 is close to unity since ucn energies @xmath24 , which are of order @xmath89 ev , are much lower than @xmath90 even for a low trap temperature @xmath91 .",
    "the corresponding velocity dependence of the spectrum is @xmath92 .",
    "relation ( [ 10 ] ) is also obtained in a fully quantum mechanical approach using the space and spin dependent se in wkb approximation @xcite .",
    "this equivalence holds for any field geometry as shown in appendix @xmath93 .",
    "in actual magnetic ucn storage systems it is difficult to make sure that the spectrum is isotropic and fills phase space uniformly up to the trapping limit . in practice",
    "this would require the complete removal of ucns with energies slightly exceeding the limit .",
    "these tend to be in quasi - stable orbits lasting for times of the order of @xmath3 , thus affecting the precision of a measurement of @xmath3 .",
    "deviations from the maxwell spectrum may also be due to the characteristics of the ucn source and of ucn transport to the trap but we will disregard these differences since they are expected to be of minor importance for the specific loss due to spin flip .      for the 1d field model of ref .",
    "@xcite the condition of constant psd was taken into account as follows : the spin - flip probability was averaged over the vertical velocity component @xmath94 in the plane @xmath95 where the gravitational downward force , @xmath96 , is balanced by the magnetic upward force , @xmath97 .",

    "since the statistical distribution of @xmath94 values is uniform for uniform psd , the mean depolarization rate is given as the average of @xmath102 as a function of @xmath94 .    to analyze the depolarization between consecutive tps we start trajectories from a tp , not from the fixed point @xmath99",

    "the asymmetry introduced by the choice of two different radii of curvature along the rows of halbach field magnets helps to randomize the orbits although fully mixing phase flow can not be achieved . to select a representative sample of orbits for depolarization calculations",
    "we assume that most particles with energy @xmath24 below the trapping limit will , at some time , be found at rest .",
    "( in practice it suffices to require @xmath109 m / s . ) in this case the particle has just reached the es @xmath110 constant .",
    "it will then be accelerated back into the region of lower potential in the direction perpendicular to the es .",
    "taking these points as the initial position for simulated trajectories starting from rest we make sure that the particle remains within the volume bounded by the es with potential @xmath111 ( as long as no spin flip to the @xmath28 state takes place ) .",
    "the statistical distribution of launch points in space is determined by the following extension of ( [ 12 ] ) to 3d geometry : we relate the launching point to the fixed point @xmath99 in the same way as for the 1d field model . equating the initial energy @xmath112 with the kinetic energy at @xmath99 , @xmath113 , we differentiate @xmath114 .",
