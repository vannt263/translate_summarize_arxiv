    "there is a sense of youthfulness to saturn s system , as if the system were now being caught in the process of evolving to something quieter .",
    "signs of youth abound , each of which has something to tell us about what happened at saturn : ( i ) saturn s rings appear both by color and dynamics to be tens or hundreds of millions of years old , rather than the billions of years that describe the solar system .",
    "( ii ) enceladus eruptions are too energetic to have been going on as they are now for more than a small fraction of the age of the solar system .",
    "( iii ) the methane in titan s atmosphere will be chemically destroyed on a time scale of order 10@xmath4 yrs , with the hydrogen escaping to space ; there is no known source of new methane , nor is there any sign on the surface of the hundreds of meters of photochemical product which would have accumulated had methane been supplied to the atmosphere over the age of the solar system .",
    "( iv ) saturn s satellite system is crowded and has at least three examples of coorbital moons , a phenomenon not seen elsewhere in the solar system .",
    "one set of coorbital satellites consists of the two small moons janus and epimetheus ( @xmath5 km and @xmath6 km in mean radius , respectively ) , traveling on mutual `` horseshoe '' orbits .",
    "the other two sets each consist of a pair of small trojan companions of larger moons : tethys is accompanied by telesto ( smith et al . 1980 ) and calypso ( pascu et al .",
    "1980 ; seidelmann et al . 1981 ) , while dione is accompanied by helene ( lecacheux et al . 1980 ) and polydeuces ( porco et al . 2007 ) .",
    "telesto , calypso , and helene are all 11 - 17 km in radius , and were discovered by ground - based observations , while tiny polydeuces is only 1.3 km in radius and was found with the cassini orbiter ( porco et al .",
    "from other spectacular cassini images , telesto and calypso appear to be covered smoothly with fine material .",
    "all of these trojan moons are intriguing because tethys and dione are adjacent ; furthermore , tethys is in a 4:2 mixed - inclination - type mean - motion resonance with mimas , while dione , helene , and polydeuces are all in a 2:1 inner - eccentricity - type mean - motion resonance with enceladus .",
    "the overall impression is paradoxical .",
    "small number statistics precludes surety , but it seems unlikely that chance alone can explain why dione and tethys each have two trojans , while all other major satellites have no such attendants . rather , there is a sense of underlying order , as if all of this came about in a perfectly ordinary way .",
    "the better to characterize this system , in this study we simulate the orbital evolution of test particles launched from tethys coorbital satellites telesto and calypso .",
    "first we describe the methodology of the numerical integrations and how we prepare the initial conditions .",
    "next we discuss evolution and fates of ejecta from telesto and calypso .",
    "the results turn out to be rather interesting : both the speed and direction of ejecta launch are important , with well - defined regimes which correspond to tadpoles , horseshoes , and passing orbits .",
    "the key points are best illustrated by strongly reductionist numerical experiments in which ejecta are launched vertically into space at various places along a satellite s equator .",
    "we then broaden our compass to consider more realistic distributions of ejecta launched from impact craters .",
    "our results imply that telesto and calypso readily exchange ejecta .",
    "we use the swift integrator package ( levison and duncan , 1994 ) to evolve the saturn system and the orbits of the ejecta forward in time .",
    "swift , which is based on work by wisdom and holman ( 1991 ) , is able to propagate the orbits of the massless test particles as well as the massive bodies using a choice of integrators . for this study",
    "we use its regularized , mixed variable symplectic integrator ( rmvs3 ) ; one of its advantages is the ability to use relatively large time - steps .",
    "another advantage of the rmvs3 method is that it can handle very close approaches between a test particle and a massive body , which are of great interest for this study .",
    "we use a customized version of swift , which we have modified to detect collisions with saturn s rings and to include saturn s optical flattening , along with its dynamical oblateness up to order @xmath7 ( dobrovolskis and lissauer , 2004 ) .",
    "all other massive bodies are treated as spherical ; although the trojan moons and hyperion are some tens of percent out of round , so that their surface gravity and escape speed should vary by a comparable amount over their surfaces , this variation is minor compared with the speeds of their impactors and ejecta .      in our ejecta integrations",
    "we include the gravitational attractions of saturn , mimas , methone , enceladus , tethys and its coorbitals calypso and telesto , dione and its coorbitals helene and polydeuces , rhea , titan , hyperion , iapetus and phoebe .",
    "the initial state vectors and gravitational constants are from r. jacobson ( sat263 model , pers .",
    "communication ) in the form of barycentric initial locations and velocities of the saturn system for epoch 26-jul-2006 , 00:00:00.0 , expressed in the icrf system ( arias et al .",
    "in addition , we modified swift to include the gravitational perturbations of the sun by treating it as a special massive , distant `` satellite '' of saturn ; we also added the mass of jupiter to that of the sun ( danby , 1962 ) .",
    "initial conditions for the sun and jupiter were obtained from the de200 jpl analytical ephemeris .",
    "finally , a rotation and a translation were performed to align the fundamental plane with saturn s equator and to set the origin at the center of saturn for our swift integrations .",
    "the initial state vector for polydeuces is from jacobson et al .",
    "( 2008 ) ; however , its j2000 barycentric initial conditions are for the epoch 2-jan-2004 , 00:00:00.0 .",
    "hence , the previous initial conditions for the saturn system ( minus polydeuces ) were integrated backwards in time using swift until 2-jan-2004 , at which point we `` drop '' the initial conditions for polydeuces ( rotated and translated as well , of course ) into our final , `` augmented '' saturn system to be used in the integrations .",
    "table 1 gives an overview of the saturn satellite system used in our integrations .",

    "in this paper we have investigated the fates of ejecta from the trojan companions of tethys , namely telesto and calypso . in the first numerical experiment",
    ", we systematically investigated the fates of ejecta launched from their equatorial regions .",
    "the initial conditions are translated and rotated from a topocentric coordinate system ( with origin at the trojan moon s surface whence the ejecta are launched ) to a saturnicentric system and fed to the swift numerical integrator ( levison and duncan , 1994 ) to propagate the particle trajectories forward in time for 100,000 years . as expected , the lowest velocity ejecta can not fully escape the source moon s gravity and fall back onto its surface in less than one day , following suborbital trajectories .",
    "ejecta do not need to achieve full escape speed to go into orbit about saturn , though ; the launch speed @xmath22 only needs to be greater than @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 is the classical escape speed , and @xmath25 ; see eq .",
    "1 ) . particles with @xmath26 or slightly higher barely escape the trojan moon s hill sphere and are confined to tadpole orbits librating about tethys @xmath0 point ( for ejecta from telesto , leading ) or @xmath1 point ( for ejecta from calypso , trailing ) .",
    "these particles can not reach tethys , and instead are eventually re - accreted by telesto or calypso respectively .",
    "an interesting finding is that the removal times of ejecta which re - impact telesto or calypso within the first dozen years or so are discretized to integer multiples of half the tadpole period .",
    "somewhat faster ejecta with azimuthal velocities @xmath2 10 m / s go into horseshoe orbits , which enclose not only the @xmath0 and @xmath1 points but also @xmath3 ; these particles still can not reach tethys or its hill sphere and are again accreted by either of the trojan moons .",
    "ejecta from telesto or calypso reaching tangential velocities @xmath2 40 m / s go into `` passing '' orbits ; beyond this point tethys accretes most particles , but some are strongly scattered inward or outwards towards other saturnian moons in adjacent orbits such as enceladus or dione ( on timescales from a few to several hundred years ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the timescale for removal of an ejectum in a horseshoe orbit is usually orders of magnitude longer than for ejecta in either tadpole or passing orbits .    in order to investigate a more realistic distribution of ejecta",
    ", we assumed an impact producing a 1-km - radius crater at five `` cardinal '' points of each trojan moon ( apex , subsaturn , antisaturn , north pole , and south pole ) .",
    "the ejection model adopted here is that of housen et al .",
    "( 1983 ) , consistent with soft regolith : the range of ejecta speeds is roughly 5 m / s to 30 m / s .",
    "as before , initial conditions are integrated for 100,000 years . as per our earlier findings",
    ", none of these particles can go into passing orbits ; indeed , all of these go into tadpole or horseshoe orbits . if the former , all particles come back to the source trojan ; if the latter , particles can hit either coorbital .",
    "however , we noted that most ( between 89% and 97% ) of particles come back to the source trojan moon .",
    "most of the rest go into the other trojan moon , with a tiny minority ( @xmath27 1% ) surviving the 100,000 year integrations .",
    "ejecta from the antapex of motion was launched according to a `` spallation '' model , with higher speeds of 5 m / s to 56 m / s , so a few percent reached tethys .",
    "the ease with which telesto and calypso exchange ejecta suggests that this recycling may help to maintain their similar sizes in the face of impact erosion .",
    "we intend to test this hypothesis in future work on the lopsided helene - dione - polydeuces system . a recent preprint ( izidoro _ et al .",
    "_ 2010 ) finds that a swarm of planetesimals tadpoling with a proto - satellite generally results in the accretion of 14 coorbital companions ; this appears to be consistent with our conclusions as well .",
