    "the solar atmosphere is a complex and dynamic environment , filled with a myriad of structures , ranging from large - scale coronal loops and prominences to small - scale granules and photospheric magnetic bright points ( mbps ) . with the increased resolution and coverage of",
    "both ground - based and space - borne instrumentation in recent years , it has become possible to observe and analyse a wider range of solar phenomena in greater detail . as certain ground - based instruments , such as the _ crisp imaging spectropolarimeter _ ( crisp ;",
    "see @xcite , @xcite ) , are capable of resolving the lower solar atmosphere on spatial scales close to @xmath6 km , a wide variety of small - scale events have been discussed , specifically in terms of how they interact with the wider environment .",
    "ellerman bombs ( often shortened to ebs within the literature ) are one example of small - scale events observed in the lower solar atmosphere . widely identified as brightenings inferred from @xmath7 - @xmath8   into the wings of the h@xmath5 line profile , ebs often form co - spatially with regions of strong magnetic field , specifically in mixed polarity regions ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "first observed by @xcite , these small - scale events are reported to have diameters ranging from around @xmath9 km to @xmath10 km and lifetimes often less than @xmath1 minutes ( as estimated by , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , meaning they are observed at the lower limits of current instrumentational capabilities .",
    "recently , @xcite presented an analysis , using a thresholding technique , of small - scale regions of intense brightening in the h@xmath5 line wings , inferred using the _ interferometric bidimensional spectrometer _",
    "( ibis ; @xcite ) situated at the dunn solar telescope ( dst ) , and found a dynamic behaviour within many events .",
    "it was concluded that many of these small events may be ebs and that higher - resolution data should decrease the average observed size of ebs .",
    "however , as was discussed by @xcite , the strong network observable within the h@xmath5 wings may also influence the thresholding technique meaning that a proportion of the less dynamic small events could be purely network brightenings and more likely associated with magnetic bright points ( mbps ) .    due to both the dynamic nature of ebs and their co - spatial formation with strong magnetic fields",
    ", it is widely hypothesised that these events are observational evidence of magnetic reconnection in the upper photosphere .",
    "@xcite presented an analysis of data collected during the flare genesis experiment ( see @xcite ) , inferring three cartoon topologies which could lead to magnetic reconnection within the lower solar atmosphere .",
    "two of these correspond to the formation of @xmath11 and @xmath12 shaped topologies due to flows within the lower atmosphere , thought to be consistent with small bi - polar regions observed in magnetogram data . by applying a linear force - free extrapolation pioneered by @xcite , @xcite discussed the nature of the photospheric magnetic fields close to eb events .",
    "it was found that approximately @xmath13% of ebs formed co - spatially with @xmath12-shaped magnetic topologies and , hence , concluded that a serpentine flux emergence model could lead to eb formation .",
    "further to this , @xcite presented observations of flows co - spatial to ebs potentially supporting the magnetic reconnection model .",
    "it was found that down- and up - flows in the photosphere and chromosphere existed , respectively , suggesting bi - dimensional plasma ejection by an explosive event , possibly sourced in the upper photosphere .",
    "interestingly , during a detailed analysis of three suspected ebs by @xcite , one event was observed to penetrate through the chromospheric canopy into the h@xmath5 line core , indicating that large vertical flows within these events can sometimes occur .",
    "a small number of studies exist which discuss observations of ebs located close to the limb of the sun .",
    "@xcite presented observations of ebs for two distinct active regions ( ars ) , one close to the disc centre and one towards the limb .",
    "it was found that the apparent lifetime of ebs was shorter when observed at the limb and , importantly , that vertical extensions were evident .",
    "this work was expanded upon by @xcite , who analysed a large group of sunspots at the limb .",
    "these observations confirmed vertical extensions of ebs and provided the first quantification of lengths , at approximately @xmath14 km , and widths , below @xmath15 km for @xmath16% of ebs .",
    "it is interesting to note , that this estimate of width agrees well with the measured diameters of ebs on the disc by , for example , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "more recently , using high - resolution h@xmath5 data , @xcite discussed the small - scale dynamics of ebs at a viewing angle of @xmath17 , finding evidence of rapid increases in area , intensity , and vertical extensions .",
    "these ` flaring ' , morphological changes were identified as evidence of a high - energy driver within the lower atmosphere , specifically , magnetic reconnection .",
    "it is clear that further analysis of events observed close to the limb at high inclination angles , as presented here , could provide interesting and useful results about the physical nature of ebs .    as well as observations ,",
    "numerical methods have also been exploited to analyse the physical properties of ebs .",
    "@xcite presented a semi - empirical model , finding that increased temperature in the lower atmosphere could lead to h@xmath5 line profiles with increased intensity in the line wings , analogous to ebs .",
    "numerical simulations , using the coordinate astronomical numerical softwares ( cans ) code , were presented in two- and three - dimensions by @xcite and @xcite , respectively , who found that flux emergence from below the photosphere could lead to @xmath12-shaped magnetic topologies and associated brightening events .",
    "more recently , a study was conducted by @xcite who found h@xmath5 wing brightenings , analogous to ebs , co - spatial with magnetic reconnection events within a mps / university of chicago radiative mhd ( muram ) simulation box .",
    "this reconnection occured in the upper photosphere and led to increased temperatures which explained the enhanced h@xmath5 wings , as hypothesised by @xcite .",
    "flows were also found , analogous to those observed by @xcite , around the reconnection site .",
    "interestingly , both the observations and the simulations showed @xmath18  line core brightenings , which have been widely associated with magnetic reconnection ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "in this article , we analyse both the morphology of ebs observed at the limb and any potential relationship between these events and the surrounding plasma .",
    "we structure our work as follows : in section 2 we discuss the data analysed in this article ; section 3 presents our results , including a statistical analysis of ebs within these data and two individual case - studies .",
    "we discuss the implications of our findings in section 4 .",
    "the ground - based data analysed in this research were collected using the crisp instrument attached to the swedish @xmath19-m solar telescope ( sst ; @xcite ) during a period of good seeing on the @xmath20st june 2012 . a large field - of - view ( fov ) , situated around ar 11506 ( _ xc_=893 , _",
    "yc_=-250  with respect to the disc centre ) , containing three sunspots was selected for observations during the period from 7:15:09 ut until 7:48:25 ut .",
    "halpha line scans , sampling 35 evenly spaced spectral positions ( each with eight repetitions ) between -2   and + 1.2   from the line core ( 6562.8  ) were obtained , and further processed using the multi - object multi - frame blind deconvolution ( momfbd ; @xcite ) image restoration method .",
    "we followed the standard procedures in the reduction pipeline for crisp data ( @xcite ) which includes the post - momfbd correction for differential stretching suggested by @xcite ( also see @xcite for more details ) . following this reduction ( which included dark- and flat - fielding ) , the pixel size of these data was @xmath21 , which corresponds to approximately @xmath22 km in a transverse scale",
    "( future distance measurements within this article will discuss distances measured using this transverse scale ) , and the temporal cadence was approximately @xmath23 seconds , hence allowing for a detailed analysis of eb events . to conduct the analysis presented here , we exploit the excellent widget - based crispex package ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we also make use of data taken by the solar dynamics observatory s _ atmospheric imaging assembly _ ( sdo / aia ; see @xcite ) instrument .",
    "these data image the entire solar disc within the uv spectrum using filters around @xmath24   and @xmath25  .",
    "these data have effective spatial and temporal resolutions of around @xmath26 km and @xmath27 seconds , respectively .",
    "the outer layer of the solar atmosphere is also observed using a number of euv filters ; however , in the analysis presented here , we show only the @xmath28   filter .",
    "each euv image has a spatial resolution of approximately @xmath26 km and a temporal resolution of @xmath29 seconds .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we present an overview of the fov analysed within this article . clockwise from the top left image , we plot the array returned by the narrow - band crisp filter for each of @xmath30  , @xmath31  , @xmath32  , and @xmath33   at approximately 7:36:20 ut . within this fov ,",
    "sit three sunspots ( two in the southern part of the fov and one in the northern section ) as well as a large plage region .",
    "it is around these sunspots that all ebs occur that are of interest for this analysis .",
    "what is immediately apparent from these images , is that the underlying photosphere is obscured by absorption resulting from the chromospheric material in the h@xmath5 line core in the bottom left image .",
    "the complex fibril structures observed in the line core appear to be present higher in the atmosphere , hence , potentially obscuring some of the vertical extent of the ebs in this dataset .",
    "we overlay three boxes on all images highlighting the three ebs analysed in detail .",
    "within the h@xmath5 line profile , ebs are easily identified as increases in intensity observed in images around @xmath7   either side of the line core .",
    "modern imaging - spectrometers , such as the crisp instrument , are able to provide fast wavelength tuning between each line position included in a line scan allowing confident identification of ebs . here",
    ", we define ebs as events which show both intensity increases which are greater than @xmath34 times the intensity of the nearby quiet sun in the wings of the h@xmath5 line profile and also a dynamic , explosive nature evidenced by imaging data . fragmenting ebs observed within these data are classified as being a single event .",
    "if an event dies completely and does not recur for five frames , any new co - spatial brightening is classified as a new eb event . by employing these guidelines ,",
    "we remove the influence of network bright points such as those situated at _ xc_=893 , _",
    "yc_=-250 , which have a consistently lower line wing intensity throughout these observations , as compared with eb wing intensity excess .",
    "overall , we confidently identify @xmath0 eb events within these observations .",
    "three regions which contain ebs during these observations are highlighted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] by black boxes for further analysis .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we plot normalised line profiles for two of the representative eb events highlighted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( solid lines ; scaled to the maximum intensity of the eb profile ) .",
    "the significant intensity increases within these events are evident when compared to the local quiet sun ( dotted lines ; also scaled to the maximum intensity of the eb profile ) . to highlight the percentage increase in intensity",
    ", we also plot the inverted ( for visual ease ) difference between the quiet sun and the eb events ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the difference between line - wing intensities peaks at over @xmath35 indicating a doubling of the intensity from the quiet sun for these eb events in their respective frames .",
    "such gradients between ebs and the background atmosphere are not observed in every frame as the intensity of individual events appears to vary on timescales of seconds ( as was discussed by @xcite ) .",
    "we note that an acceptable thresholding value is highly dependent on a number of factors such as the instrumentation , data processing techniques , and the seeing at the time of the observations .    after the identification of all apparent ebs in the data , each event was carefully analysed to determine its lifetime and area .",
    "as the definitions between ebs and the background are strong in these data ( as is shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] ) , the estimation of the lifetime was easily completed by analysing the evolution of each eb through time .",
    "the initial and final frames of each event were identified visually by studying the imaging data which show the evolution of these events clearly .",
    "overall , the average lifetime of ebs in these data was found to be approximately @xmath36 minutes , comparable to previous researches by , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the shortest and longest - lived events , respectively , were three minute and around @xmath1 minutes .",
    "the distribution of lifetimes within these data is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a .",
    "we plot both the peak width and peak length of each eb event against lifetime in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b and fig .",
    "it is apparent ( although not significantly correlated ) that longer lived ebs appear to be larger ( as previously discussed by @xcite ) .",
    "as the majority of ebs exhibit parabolic morphological evolutions through time ( as evidenced in fig  [ fig4 ] ) , it appears that the strength of the initial driver is a key variable in defining the statistical properties ( such as lifetime and area ) of each eb event .",
    "it should be noted that parabolic and ballistic profiles would not be discernible within these data due to their similarity in the photosphere and the spatial resolution .",
    "therefore , we use ` parabolic ' as an umbrella term for both profile types . basic energy estimates of ebs ( see , for example , @xcite ) require both lifetime and area and , hence , it would appear that a correlation exists between lifetime and energy release .",
    "future analysis with a larger statistical sample should further test this assertion .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , a representative eb event is plotted through its onset until it reaches its peak length .",
    "the eb appears simulataneously and co - spatially in both wings before extending away along a constant trajectory .",
    "the black lines in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] indicate the path of the eb over time .",
    "it is interesting to note that all but two of the ebs analysed appear to have tips which extend and contract with parabolic profiles , however , horizontal motions within these events are also common .",
    "each eb was carefully analysed for both vertical and horizontal motions and the results were recorded .",
    "for the parabolic ebs identified , an average vertical speed of around @xmath2 km s@xmath3 was observed ( from onset to peak extension ) , with most events reaching higher velocities during their most explosive periods .",
    "it was found that @xmath37 of the eb events analysed here exhibited transverse motions , averaging at @xmath34 km s@xmath3 ( similar to velocities observed by , for example , @xcite , @xcite ) ; however , several ebs had apparent motions over @xmath38 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the average horizontal speed is slightly higher than previous estimates ( by , _",
    "e.g _ , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , probably due to a small number of extremely dynamic events which are observed .",
    "we examine two ebs with significant horizontal speeds , and an apparent influence on the wider atmosphere , in detail in the following case studies .",
    "co - spatial euv data inferred by the sdo / aia instrument are also analysed for each eb . as ebs consist of a vertical extension",
    ", one may expect that some signature would be observed in the upper atmosphere , however , the majority of previous studies have found no signal even within the h@xmath5 line core ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . despite recent work by @xcite suggesting that some ebs may penetrate into the chromosphere , it is still unclear whether these events have any influence on the chromosphere and corona .",
    "the ebs analysed in this article show no influence in the upper atmosphere ( although this lack of influence is to be expected within data collected at the limb ) , specifically within the h@xmath5 line core , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , or the euv sdo / aia filters , as plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] and fig .",
    "had co - spatial iris observations been available for this research , it would have been interesting to analyse what the overall influence of ebs is on the transition region plasma around 100,000 k.    as the intensity enhancement of an eb occurs in both wings of the h@xmath5 line profile simultaneously and corresponds to apparent vertical motions , it is likely that these observables are a result of increased temperature and density within the ejected plasma compared to the surrounding atmosphere .",
    "this hypothesis agrees with simulations of ebs within the lower solar atmosphere ( by , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ; @xcite ) , and with observations of flows co - spatial to eb events ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "it has been widely speculated , as previously discussed , that magnetic reconnection in the photosphere could lead to plasma ejection , hence creating density increases in the local atmosphere similar to those observed here ; however , it should be noted that no magnetic field data of sufficient resolution comparable to eb cross - sections are available for comparison to the crisp data .      in these data , it is common that large , apparent horizontal motions are observed within ebs during their lifetimes .",
    "how these horizontal motions lead to interactions with plasma in the wider atmosphere is of specific interest and could prove key in assessing the potential influence of ebs within the solar photosphere . in previous studies",
    ", it has proved difficult to accurately link eb events with any other solar phenomena and , hence , they have been analysed as localised events . here",
    ", we present one specific example of a region which appears to be susceptible to the formation of a number of ebs in a structured manner .",
    "eb events within this region display strong horizontal motions and appear to trigger other , similar events in different spatial locations .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we plot the evolution of the northern event emphasised in fig  [ fig1 ] with the label ` cs1 ' , with respect to time for both @xmath39   and @xmath40   ( @xmath41   and @xmath42   from the line core , respectively ) .",
    "the first frame depicts the original eb , before spatial fracturing within this event is evident in the second frame ( indicated by arrows ) .",
    "each independent fracture appears to slowly propagate away from the original footpoint along the bright trail evident in the third frame .",
    "after the original eb fades for long enough such that it is deemed to have ended , a second large eb event occurs , as evidenced in the fourth frame .",
    "this rapid morphology is reminiscent of the evolution of the magnetic field simulated by , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite , where an emerging flux rope formed in a ` sea - serpent'-like manner reconnected at each individual @xmath12 to form a larger over - lying loop .",
    "ebs have been shown to occur co - spatially with inter - granular lanes ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it is possible that the bright trail which appears to guide the ebs is evidence of a localised network structure , or an inter - granular lane . on",
    "- disc observations of the h@xmath5 line wings often include weak intensity increases , reminiscent of this trail , co - spatial to strong magnetic fields , inferred using magnetogram or @xmath43-band data .",
    "it is , therefore , possible that these ebs are propagating along a defined structure and , hence , that further information could be derived by analysing on - disc examples of such events .",
    "high - resolution , multi - wavelength observations close to the disc centre should be further investigated to infer whether these events are indeed guided by the magnetic field .",
    "it has been widely reported that ebs both migrate ( for example , @xcite , @xcite ) and appear to recur , but what has not been presented yet in such detail , is a direct link between two apparently different , and highly structured , events .",
    "this does pose several important questions which can be discussed here .",
    "for example , what process is leading to the creation of multiple vertical peaks within this individual eb ?",
    "if magnetic reconnection is indeed the driver of ebs , then , are we observing a ` train ' of reconnection through a ` sea - serpentine ' morphology as simulated by @xcite ?",
    "thus , are sequential and apparently connected ebs a signature of a yet un - determined large - scale sub - surface process ?",
    "the spatial separation between the initial and final eb event is around @xmath44 km , hence , this would suggest that a single reconnection event in a unstable region could lead to a sustained energy release within the local plasma ( of course , this statement also applies if another driver is the cause of these events ) . for a full analysis of events such as this to be completed , high - resolution magnetic field data",
    "would be required , well beyond the current capabilities of instrumentation .",
    "it is , therefore , imperative that further research be carried out using both imaging observations and state - of - the - art computational modelling .",
    "the second important result which can be drawn from this event is that small - scale eb dynamics , as discussed by @xcite , are conspicuous within these data .",
    "it is inherently clear that higher - resolution data may allow further insight into the dependence , or indeed independence , of these small - scale events to close - by larger eb events .",
    "the individual parabolic profiles evident in each of the smaller - scale structures ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]a ) analysed in this example ( analogous to the profiles observed in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) adds weight to the argument that each fragment may be formed by a separate ( or a single repetitive migrating ) driver .",
    "overall , we suggest that future analysis of ebs in a wide range of datasets be conducted to assess whether a minimum eb size is determinable using modern instrumentation .",
    "the final case study included within this article focuses on the event highlighted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] by the box labeled ` cs2 ' .",
    "a number of interesting morphological features are observed during the evolution of this event which further evidence the dynamical nature of ebs .",
    "this eb exhibits the most rapid apparent horizontal motions observed in this dataset ( around @xmath45 km s@xmath3 ) , which occur during an apparent splitting of the event .",
    "such dynamics have yet to be studied in the literature and provide a potentially excellent diagnostic tool for future analysis of the driver of ebs .",
    "the evolution of the event is depicted by the top row of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] which shows information observed at @xmath46  .",
    "the original eb , initial splitting , fading , and then loop formation are visualised from left to right , respectively .",
    "the bottom row of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] includes a time - distance plot for the spatial positioning indicated by the black line in the top row .",
    "the initial off - shoot appears to be as bright as the original eb event and propagates away from the formation site at a speed of @xmath47 km s@xmath3 .",
    "this is over four times the average apparent horizontal motion speed of ebs within these data .",
    "the off - shoot continues to move away from the large eb and decelerates until it reaches a speed of around @xmath48 km s@xmath3 .",
    "a black line is overlaid on the time - distance plot to emphasise the path of the off - shoot .    of particular interest here",
    "is the similarity of this evolution to magnetic flux emergence events .",
    "comparable morphological traits to these were reported by both @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these researches analysed events which had initial separation speeds of around @xmath8 km s@xmath3 that dropped to around @xmath19 km s@xmath3 , and spatial separations of the footpoints on the order of @xmath44 km - @xmath49 km .",
    "flux emergence models also commonly discuss the occurrence of bright regions at the footpoints of formed loops ( by such authors as @xcite ) , as observed here in the form of ebs .",
    "these brightenings have been linked to reconnection between the emerging and existing fields and could facilitate the transport of energy from the lower solar atmosphere into the corona ( as found to be , for example , by @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , as this event occurs during the final frames of this dataset , we are unable to establish whether this brightening and loop structure displays the traits observed in previous studies .",
    "interestingly , @xcite observed the occurrence of eb pairs , separated by around @xmath38 .",
    "it is plausible that such pairs were formed in a comparable method to that described in this subsection .    in terms of ebs ,",
    "this apparent link to an observation of flux emergence could prove exciting .",
    "magnetic flux emergence has long been discussed as a potential driver of magnetic reconnection ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and , in particular , as a driver for ebs ( suggested by , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we acknowledge that no co - spatial magnetic field data is available and , as such , we are unable to conclusively link this event with flux emergence , however , the similarities presented here are compelling",
    ". it should be noted by the reader that other alternatives exist to the flux emergence scenario , such as mass loading of an already existing loop . a larger - scale study of such events",
    "would be required to definitely answer this point .",
    "it is also unfortunate that these observations end co - temporally with the fourth frame of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , meaning that we are unable to analyse the full extent of this event .",
    "a variety of datasets should be analysed in the near future to further test these findings , specifically in terms of how many ebs are actually linked to examples of flux emergence .",
    "the results presented here support the conclusions of earlier investigations , where it has been suggested that ebs are energetic explosive events emanating from the lower solar atmosphere ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the average lifetime and spatial properties of brightenings analysed in this article ( @xmath36 minutes and widths around @xmath50 ) are comparable to values reported by a number of authors as properties of ebs , therefore , allowing us to confidently link these near - limb events to on - disc ebs .",
    "however , we present the first limb measurements of eb lengths using state - of - the - art ground based instrumentation , finding the average height of these events to be @xmath51 km ( which is well below the believed height of formation for the h@xmath5 line core of @xmath52 km ) .",
    "this is slightly shorter than previous estimates by @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that a plethora of highly dynamic events within our data were observed which did not eventually reach the required intensity threshold , possibly due to a mixing of events within the line - of - sight manifesting in a single less intense line profile . because of this",
    ", we suggest that further study of ebs at the limb with a range of datasets could provide interesting additional insights .",
    "we also find strong evidence of flows associated with ebs , agreeing with previous observations by , for example , @xcite at the limb and @xcite on the disc .",
    "the tips of @xmath1 out of @xmath0 events appear to follow a parabolic path through time suggesting the occurrence of a displacement of plasma , increasing the density and temperature within a localised region , hence , leading to the enhancement of the intensity in the wings of the h@xmath5 line profile .",
    "we suggest that this propagation of plasma is analogous to the flows observed by @xcite at a simulated reconnection site where rapid cancellation of opposite polarity field occured .",
    "unfortunately , due to the fov of these observations being situated at the solar limb , we are unable to confidently present co - temporal , co - aligned magnetic field data to analyse with this dataset ; hence , further assertions about the formation of these events elude us .",
    "we note , however , that no evidence of ebs within the h@xmath5 line core or the sdo / aia euv filters is found , agreeing with previous studies which have concluded that the vertical extensions of these events may not be sufficient enough to penetrate into the chromosphere and lower corona .",
    "the two individual case studies presented in section @xmath38 highlight small - scale dynamics associated with ebs which have not previously been observed . within the first case study",
    ", the influence of an eb on the surrounding atmosphere was analysed .",
    "a large eb event appeared ( by visual inspection ) to fragment , with the small - scale pieces appearing to propagate north , away from the initial event .",
    "each of the small - scale fragments were only around @xmath53 km in diameter , similar in size to the events analysed by @xcite .",
    "the northern - most fragment drifted to around @xmath54 km from the initial position before reducing dramatically in size and fading below the threshold of @xmath34 times the background intensity .",
    "a second large eb event was , then , observed to occur at the same spatial position .",
    "this case study highlights the influence that ebs can have on the surrounding localised plasma .",
    "other examples of the horizontal extensions of ebs are also observed within these data , however , as these events are further towards the limb , we are unable to fully resolve any potential smaller - scale structures within the larger event .    the second case study discussed a rapid splitting of a large eb event close to a large sunspot .",
    "the main body of the ejection appeared to propagate south , away from the initial event , and continued through until the end of these observations , decelerating from around @xmath47 km s@xmath3 to approximately @xmath48 km s@xmath3 .",
    "possibly , the most interesting aspect of this example is the apparent loop formation between the two main bodies in the h@xmath5 line wings , potentially indicating a flux emergence region ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite ) . despite a significant apparent vertical extension of this loop ,",
    "no evidence of any such structure within the h@xmath5 line core was found ( possibly due to the dense foreground structures in the h@xmath5 line core obscuring any signal ) suggesting that even a dynamic event , such as this example , has no initial influence on the upper chromosphere .",
    "unfortunately , our observations end before the loop faded and we are unable to discuss the full evolution of this event .",
    "we strongly encourage that further work be carried out to fully test whether other flux emergence regions can be correlated to ebs .",
    "overall , we suggest that this analysis highlights both the small - scale structuring and dynamic nature of ebs .",
    "an investigation of a wide variety of these events at a range of spatial positions over the sun would be required to fully understand how many ebs display morphologies similar to those discussed within the presented case studies .",
    "we have now addressed the importance of investigating the sub - structures of small - scale , explosive phenomena in the lower solar atmosphere which can act as important agents in triggering local instabilities in the magnetic environment of the solar surface . such influence can be both vertically and horizontally orientated and require extensive future study .",

    "<S> ellerman bombs ( ebs ) have been widely studied in recent years due to their dynamic , explosive nature and apparent links to the underlying photospheric magnetic field implying that they may be formed by magnetic reconnection in the photosphere . despite a plethora of researches discussing the morphologies of ebs , there has been a limited investigation of how these events appear at the limb , specifically , whether they manifest as vertical extensions away from the disc . in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we make use of high - resolution , high - cadence observations of an active region ( ar ) at the solar limb , collected by the _ crisp imaging spectropolarimeter _ ( crisp ) instrument , to identify ebs and infer their physical properties . </S>",
    "<S> the upper atmosphere is also probed using the solar dynamic observatory s _ atmospheric imaging assembly _ ( sdo / aia ) . </S>",
    "<S> we analyse @xmath0 eb events evident within these data , finding that @xmath1 appear to follow a parabolic path away from the solar surface at an average speed of @xmath2 km s@xmath3 , extending away from their source by @xmath4 km , before retreating back at a similar speed . </S>",
    "<S> these results show strong evidence of vertical motions associated with ebs , possibly explaining the dynamical ` flaring ' ( changing in area and intensity ) observed in on - disc events . </S>",
    "<S> two in - depth case studies are also presented which highlight the unique dynamical nature of ebs within the lower solar atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> the viewing angle of these observations allows for a direct linkage between these ebs and other small - scale events in the h@xmath5 line wings , including a potential flux emergence scenario . </S>",
    "<S> the findings presented here suggest that ebs could have a wider - reaching influence on the solar atmosphere than previously thought , as we reveal a direct linkage between ebs and an emerging small - scale loop , and other near - by small - scale explosive events . </S>",
    "<S> however , as previous research found , these extensions do not appear to impact upon the h@xmath5 line core , and are not observed by the sdo / aia euv filters . </S>"
