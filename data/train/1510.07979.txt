    "however , coupling a light beam with a three - dimensional ensemble of emitters extended over regions beyond a wavelength remains a challenge .",
    "a tightly focused beam couples well only to a small number of atoms in the focus region , whereas an extended beam such as a plane wave has the right mode for the ensemble but couples weakly to the individual atoms .",
    "a nanoguide depicted in fig.[fig : system ] presents a clever and efficient route for coupling a large number of material particles to a single mode of an optical field  @xcite .",
    "the nanoguide acts as an antenna that converts the dipolar radiation pattern of an atom and matches it to the fundamental spatial mode of the dielectric waveguide .",

    "the orange curve displays a super - radiant mode that preserves the extended character of its ordered counterpart discussed in fig.[fig : specext](a ) , while the purple curve shows a characteristic exponential envelope that corresponds to localized states .",
    "these states are marked in fig.[fig : specloc](b ) , which plots the complex eigenvalues of the various modes .",
    "the resemblance of the eigenvalue distribution in the superradiant sector of fig.[fig : specloc](b ) reveals a clear similarity between the extended wavefunctions of the ordered and disordered chains . in contrast , localized states gather in the subradiant sector where participation numbers @xmath50 indicate the confinement of the excitation to a limited region of the chain .",

    "figure[fig : spectbs](a ) displays the pair character of the eigenstates in an exemplary mode function for a chain of @xmath35 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 . in this regime ,",
    "the previously obtained general limit no longer applies , and the polariton spectrum shows a significant number of strongly subradiant states with decay rates several orders of magnitude below @xmath32 [ see fig.[fig : spectbs](b ) ] .",
    "these sharp resonances generate distinct features in the transmission spectrum shown in fig.[fig : spectbs](c ) .",
    "the subradiant two - body states do not overlap spectrally , and their odd wavefunctions [ @xmath58 are hardly driven by the waveguide mode , which varies slowly across the pair . as a result , we obtain a high transmission at @xmath59 .",
    "in contrast , the superradiant resonances spectrally overlap and provide strong scattering and losses from the waveguide at @xmath60 ( cf . supplemental material for details ) .",
    "this induces the steep change of more than 4 orders of magnitude in the transmittivity over few atomic linewidths .",
    "the coincidence between the transmission dips and polariton resonances at @xmath61 is underlined by the vertical projections in fig.[fig : spectbs](b , c ) .    the dominant purple hues in fig.[fig : spectbs](b )",
    "show that almost all polariton modes , including the most subradiant ones near @xmath62 , are strongly confined to @xmath63 emitters .",
    "in fact , it turns out that the participation number distribution is strongly peaked at @xmath64 .",
    "this comes along with a strongly asymmetric shape of the spectrum in the complex plane , where a significant fraction of the states gather near the green curve , which is obtained for a chain of @xmath53 emitters found at different spatial separations , leading to one super- and one subradiant state @xcite .",
    "while in the guided far field , @xmath12 could acquire any complex phase , providing both super- and subradiant states at positive or negative values of @xmath43 , the phase is fixed in near - field coupling . as a result , @xmath44 and @xmath43 become correlated and the polaritonic states gather in red - detuned subradiant and blue - detuned superradiant sectors in the complex plane .",
    "to illustrate this situation for solid - state systems , in fig.[fig : spectbs](c ) we consider moderate dephasing by replacing @xmath65 in the denominator of the polarizability , where now @xmath66 is the natural linewidth .",
    "@xmath67 provides a lower limit to the collective linewidths and , as displayed by the red curve in fig.[fig : spectbs](c ) , the sharp features of the system are smoothed out .",
    "above we have studied the basic influence of order , disorder and near - field coupling between the atomic consituents of a dielectric nanoguide on its optical response .",
    "we now show that for large enough densities , the collective coherent interaction of the atoms with the single guided mode of the waveguide leads the hybrizidation between the atomic ensemble and the nanoguide mode , an effect that is usually known in coupled oscillators .",
    "rabi splitting in the solid state was realized soon after the first gas - phase studies of strong coupling between an atom and a high-@xmath68 cavity  @xcite . to achieve this",
    ", scientists investigated the reflectivity and transmission of light from quantum wells embedded in microcavities at cryogenic temperatures  @xcite .",
    "this pioneering work has triggered similar activities on ensembles of organic molecules coupled to low-@xmath68 microcavities at room temperature  @xcite , where a large number of emitters show collective strong coupling despite substantial homogeneous and inhomogeneous spectral broadenings .",
    "interestingly , similar mode splitting has also been reported for an ensemble of molecules coupled to surface plasmons  @xcite .",
    "the physical picture describing these experiments has been the coupling of two pendula with well - defined resonances , whereby the collection of emitters is modelled with an effective polarizability  @xcite .",
    "we now show that although the nanoguide considered in this work only provides a propagating mode without any resonance , it can nevertheless hybridize with atoms at sufficiently high densities . in particular , our treatment shows how the collective effect of emitters emerges from multiple scattering and interference of the light field confined within the nanoguide mode .     in a near - ideal waveguide @xmath69 for @xmath70 ( purple to red ) emitters .",
    "the signal is normalized to the absorption by @xmath3 uncoupled resonant emitters .",
    "the red curve shows narrow peaks near @xmath71 for subradiant modes .",
    "b ) same as in ( a ) but for chains of @xmath72 ( purple to red ) emitters in the case of a homogeneous broadening with @xmath73 . ]    to gain intuition into the underlying physics of polaritonic rabi splitting , we first consider the simplest case of two individual atoms coupled via a waveguide  @xcite . since a single atom with @xmath74 can act as a perfect mirror for a photon entering the nanoguide  @xcite , two atoms placed at a large distance can form an optical resonator . unlike in a usual fabry - prot cavity , the `` mirrors '' are influenced by each other s presence .",
    "the delocalized collective states in this case are described by mode functions @xmath75 and complex resonances .",
    "thus , the splitting @xmath76 is maximized at @xmath77 for the case of far - field coupling .",
    "figure[fig : splitting](a ) illustrates the frequency - dependent absorption @xmath78 $ ] ( normalized to the case of uncoupled emitters on resonance ) in chains of few atoms spaced at @xmath79 in a waveguide of @xmath69 .",
    "the splitting for two emitters is clearly visible .",
    "increasing the number of emitters leads to multiple scattering and formation of many collective modes as discussed in the previous sections .",
    "it is also evident that the splitting between the absorption maxima grows . to investigate the effect of coherence and large homogeneous broadenings encountered in room - temperature solid - state systems , in fig.[fig : splitting](b ) we allow for a ten - fold homogeneous broadening of @xmath80 .",
    "we find that spectral splitting still occurs , but it requires a higher number of emitters to compensate for a reduced coupling efficiency , which in turn causes less efficient hybridization among emitters .",
    "furthermore , we note that the faster spectral variations are washed out .",
    "and @xmath81 filled to a constant length of @xmath82 .",

    "the dashed white curves give the analytic result of a mean - field approach in each case .",
    "]    next , we increase the density of emitters in a waveguide of fixed length @xmath90 and finite @xmath91 , hosting emitters with additional broadening @xmath80 .",
    "figure[fig : hybridization](a ) displays the absorption of light propagating through the nanoguide medium as a function of @xmath3 and frequency detuning @xmath41 from a single - emitter resonance .",
    "we see that one can indeed arrive at a large frequency splitting for higher densities ( or equivalently @xmath3 ) .",
    "the general shift that accompanies the splitting for larger @xmath3 is caused by near - field interactions among neighboring atoms .",
    "this effect can be approximated by @xmath92 $ ] plotted by the white dotted curve .",
    "the important result here is the observation of a spectral splitting in a dense ensemble of atoms simply because their emission is coupled efficiently enough to a nanoguide to cause hybridization between its mode and their collective emitter resonances . to this end",
    ", one can also identify the main role of a microcavity @xcite or surface plasmon @xcite in offering an efficient single mode for efficient multiple scattering of many emitters . in this picture , the spectral or angular resonances of such structures are not of fundamental importance .",
    "a decisive indicator of collective hybridization with the guided mode is a repulsive splitting in the dispersion relation of the system at hand  @xcite . in fig.[fig : hybridization](b , c ) we plot the absorption of a nanoguide containing an atomic chain as a function of the frequency detuning @xmath41 of the driving field and its wavenumber ( periodicity ) @xmath84 .",
    "driving of the nanoguide with different wavevectors can be experimentally achieved in a kretschmann configuration .",
    "fig.[fig : hybridization](b ) shows that multiple peaks at a given value of @xmath84 are still visible in a sample as small as @xmath87 while there is no clear avoided crossing . in longer chains , on the other hand ,",
    "the subpeaks are suppressed and the absorption maximum splits into two branches that approach the dispersion curve @xmath93 of the empty waveguide [ see white solid curve in fig.[fig : hybridization](c ) for @xmath88 ] . dispersion of the latter is negligible since @xmath95 .",
    "figs.[fig : hybridization](d , e ) show that all these features persist when a broadening @xmath80 is assumed .    finally , we examine the observed normal mode splitting in the context of an effective medium response  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath96 , e.g. for the cases of fig.[fig : hybridization](c , e ) , we can apply a mean - field approximation @xcite and restrict the impact of near - field coupling to the above global shift , to obtain an analytical expression of the wave number inside the filled region ( see supplemental material for details ) .",
    "to lowest order in the polarizability , the system response at a wave number @xmath97 fulfills a generalized clausius - mossotti relation @xmath98 we note that here @xmath99 and @xmath100 denote the effective mode cross - section and refractive index of the empty waveguide mode , and the polarizability @xmath101 is given in si - units . the white dashed curves in fig.[fig : hybridization](b , c ) , which plots @xmath102 $ ] , reveal a very good agreement between this analytical phenomenological result and the numerical calculations when sufficiently large numbers of emitters are considered .",
    "in this work , we have developed a semiclassical theoretical platform for examining the interaction of light with a collection of atoms in a one - dimensional subwavelength waveguide , where the atomic emission is efficiently coupled to the waveguide mode .",
    "our approach is based on the explicit solution of the multiple - scattering problem in terms of collective response functions , using the exact dipole emission pattern in a cylindrical nanoguide and a semiclassical polarizability .",
    "this formalism is in excellent agreement with a quantum - optical master equation for the case of weak driving fields and can be readily extended to multilevel atoms  @xcite by using a modified polarizability .",
    "we based our treatment on a one - dimensional lattice of atoms that could be randomly displaced by @xmath6 , up to one lattice constant @xmath2 .",
    "however , the calculations can also be extended to @xmath103 to allow for other disorder models @xcite and clusters beyond pairs to consider excluded volumes and possible self - organization @xcite .",
    "in addition to spatial disorder , the model could also be extended to include inhomogeneous spectral distributions as commonly encountered in solid - state systems .",
    "although an ideal scenario of a 1d nanoguide strives for an emitter - waveguide coupling efficiency @xmath104 , real experimental systems will have serious difficulties to reach this limit .",
    "we have , thus , chosen to work with moderate values of @xmath46 and have shown that while low values of @xmath46 degrade the hybridization between the emitters , significant collective coupling between the emitters and the waveguide mode remains feasible and can be compensated by adding more emitters . in this sense",
    ", @xmath46 plays the same role as in the performance of microcavities .",
    "an important message of our work is to emphasize the need for considering the near - field dipole - dipole coupling that results from subwavelength inter - atomic spacings .",
    "this situation arises both for very dense regular chains and for large degrees of disorder as known from glassy dielectrics . in either case , a strong near - field coupling generates spectrally selective narrow features in the optical response .    our nanoscopic model of multiple",
    "scattering describes mutual hybridization while including the effect of decoherence and linewidth broadening .",
    "we have seen that each realization of the ensemble may contain many spectral features that arise from near - field interactions or from disorder and state localization . by averaging over a large number of such individual configurations",
    ", one can arrive at an effective optical response for the corresponding one - dimensional dielectric medium .",
    "in fact , we demonstrated that a mean - field limit asymptotically agrees with our explicit solution of the scattering problem .",
    "this provides a link between the present work and effective medium descriptions of light propagation through a resonant medium .",
