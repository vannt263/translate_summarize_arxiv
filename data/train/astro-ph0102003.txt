    "recent detections of afterglow emission in the x - ray , optical and radio has revolutionized gamma - ray burst ( grb ) astronomy ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) .",
    "the afterglow emission appears to be reasonably well - described by the fireball model @xcite , in which a relativistically expanding shell of hot gas encounters an external quiescent medium .",
    "a blast wave is created , sweeping up the ambient material , and accelerating relativistic electrons which then emit synchrotron radiation @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the spectral flux of the afterglow is a broken power - law function of frequency which evolves with time in a way that depends on the physical parameters of the fireball and its surrounding medium , such as the total energy output of the grb source , the collimation angle of the outflow , the ambient gas density , the fraction of the post shock energy which is converted into magnetic fields and accelerated electrons , and the energy distribution of the accelerated electrons @xcite .",
    "so far , observations of the afterglow spectrum over a wide range of frequencies and times was the primary method used to place constraints on these parameters ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "crude constraints on the size of the emitting region at late times were derived based on considerations involving synchrotron self - absorption @xcite and radio scintillations due to the intervening interstellar medium of the milky - way galaxy @xcite .    the afterglow image is predicted to appear as a thin ring on the sky @xcite at frequencies near or above the peak of the synchrotron emission @xcite , but more like a uniform disk around or below the synchrotron self - absorption frequency @xcite . in between breaks in the power - law spectrum of an afterglow ,",
    "the contrast and width of this ring evolve self - similarly , i.e.  the brightness profile maintains its shape as a function of radius when the latter is normalized by the expanding circular boundary of the image @xcite .",
    "the self - similar brightness profile of the image changes only across spectral breaks @xcite .",
    "the outer radius of the image expands radially at an apparent superluminal speed of @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the lorentz factor of the emitting shock .",
    "the image occupies an angle of @xmath9 relative to the center of the explosion due to relativistic beaming , and hence has a radius @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the shock radius .",
    "geometric time delay implies that the observed time , @xmath12 , and so the radius scales as @xmath13 . for an ambient density profile @xmath14",
    ", one gets @xmath15 . therefore , @xmath16 with @xmath17 $ ] . for a uniform ambient medium with @xmath18 @xcite , @xmath19 , while for a wind profile with @xmath20 one gets @xmath21 .",
    "the predicted differences between the afterglow images in these two cases are typically small @xcite .. ]    by resolving the image of a grb afterglow at different frequencies , one can obtain precious , new constraints on the fireball model .",
    "as originally pointed out by @xcite , after about one day , the angular size of a grb ring is typically a micro - arcsecond ( @xmath22as ) , i.e. of the same order as the angular einstein ring radius of a solar mass lens at cosmological distances , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the lens mass , and @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the angular diameter distances between the observer - source , observer - lens , and lens - source , respectively . this fortuitous coincidence , along with the fact that the afterglow image expands superluminally , means that lensing by an intervening solar - mass star will produce a detectable deviation in the afterglow light curve with a duration suitable for intense monitoring . as the afterglow image expands , different parts of it sweep by the lens and get amplified .",
    "the differential magnification of the source image can be used to recover the radial structure of the afterglow image through a series of relative flux measurements @xcite .",
    "the probability that a source at redshift @xmath29 will have a projected angular distance less than the einstein radius of any intervening star ( the optical depth ) is @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the cosmological density of stars in units of the critical density .",
    "the value of @xmath31 is constrained to be @xmath32 based of the known populations of luminous @xcite and faint @xcite stars and @xmath33 based on big - bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "hence , @xmath34 @xcite , and roughly one out of a hundred afterglows should be strongly magnified ( although all events may show weak magnification signals due to a star located at ten einstein radii from their line - of - sight ; see @xcite ) .",
    "intense monitoring of lensing events could provide invaluable information about the nature of grb afterglows .",
    "recently , @xcite interpreted the unusual optical afterglow light curve of grb 000301c @xcite as being microlensed by an intervening @xmath35 star .",
    "they found that the optical - infrared light curve was well - fit by a model in which the emission originated from a ring of fractional width @xmath5 , in agreement with earlier theoretical predictions .",
    "@xcite argued that , if one adopts realistic surface brightness profiles for the afterglow image , the optical / infrared afterglow of grb 000301c can not be explained by microlensing .",
    "@xcite showed , however , that microlensing can reproduce the observed light curve , provided that the source is significantly limb - brightened , namely that @xmath36 of the flux arises from the outer 25% of the area of the afterglow .",
    "this requirement is met by the surface brightness profiles expected for emission frequencies above the cooling break frequency @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the light curve coverage in radio frequencies was too sparse to uniquely confirm the microlensing interpretation through , e.g.  comparison of the inferred surface brightness profiles across spectral breaks .",
    "the idea of using microlensing to study the images of gamma - ray burst afterglows is similar in spirit to the idea of using microlensing to resolve the atmospheres of stars in the magellenic clouds and the galactic bulge @xcite ; for a recent review , see @xcite . for background stars ,",
    "the source radius stays constant and the resolution of the source occurs because the caustic structure of the lens sweeps over the face of the star due to the relative source - lens motion .",
    "however , for grb afterglows the relative source - lens motion is negligible , and the resolution occurs as the image of the source itself is expanding and sweeping by the lens .",
    "microlensing has been used to measure limb - darkening of the stars in the small magellenic cloud and the galactic bulge @xcite and also to measure the spatial variations of spectral lines across the face of two stars @xcite . @xcite",
    "considered the signal - to - noise requirements for resolving stellar atmospheres with microlensing .",
    "our goal here is to apply similar considerations to grb afterglows .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the observational constraints that can be obtained on afterglow images through a concerted monitoring effort of the grb community in future microlensing events . specifically , we determine the expected statistical errors in the recovered intensity profile as a function of various parameters and input assumptions , assuming that the afterglow and microlensing event parameters are known .",
    "this significance of this work is twofold : first , we show that the radial intensity profile of afterglows can be determined with fairly good accuracy ( @xmath37 ) for reasonable expense of observational resources , and second , we present the effects of various assumptions on the error in the recovered intensity profile , in order to test the robustness of the conclusions and to provide guidelines for observers . in   [ sec : grbs ] we present the formalism for microlensing of grb afterglows .",
    "we describe the method for determining the expected errors in the recovered intensity profile in  [ sec : errors ] , and apply it to a fiducial case in   [ sec : scaling ] . in   [ sec : inputs ] , we determine the effects of various input assumptions on the errors . finally , we summarize the implications of our primary results and discuss the effects of some of our ( unavoidably ) simplified assumptions in   [ sec : conclusions ] .    for concreteness , we will primarily focus on the scaling laws of a spherical fireball in a uniform medium , but derive a general scaling relation for the recovered errors in the relative intensity profile that is applicable for any power - law external density profile , @xmath38 . the two currently popular models , @xmath18 ( uniform medium ) and @xmath20 ( stellar wind ) yield qualitatively similar conclusions .",
    "we do not consider jetted outflows , although a collimated outflow of opening angle @xmath39 would behave as if it is part of a spherical fireball at early time as long as @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "we also assume that the afterglow flux exhibits a single power - law slope , which is appropriate if the observed frequency does not cross one of the several breaks in the afterglow spectrum ( see @xcite ) .",
    "note that we do not assume any specific , model - dependent form for the intensity profile , i.e. we do not evaluate the errors on the coefficients of some parametric form for the profile .",
    "rather , we evaluate the minimum attainable errors via direct inversion of the afterglow light curve .",
    "for a spherical fireball , the observer sees a circular source image with an outer radius of angular size @xmath41 that evolves as , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the angular size of the afterglow after @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the observed time in days , and @xmath46/[2(4-k)]$ ] for an external medium with density profile @xmath14 .",
    "the angular size @xmath47 depends on the energy of the burst , the density of the ambient medium , and the redshift of the burst . for typical parameters ,",
    "@xmath43 is of order @xmath48 .",
    "as long as an observed frequency , @xmath49 , does not cross any of the time - dependent spectral break frequencies , the afterglow flux at that frequency evolves as a power - law of time ( e.g. , sari et al .",
    "1999 ) @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the flux after @xmath44 .",
    "@xcite provide a comprehensive study of the predicted image profile in the different spectral regimes .",
    "now assume that an intervening compact object lies at an angular distance @xmath52 from the line - of - sight to the center of the afterglow .",
    "we may then normalize the angular radius of the afterglow image in units of the einstein radius of this object ( eq . [ eqn : thetae ] ) , @xmath53 where @xmath54 since both @xmath43 and @xmath55 are @xmath56 for typical parameters , @xmath57 is of order unity .",
    "the value of @xmath57 depends very weakly on the grb energy output and the ambient density normalization , but is more sensitive to the lens mass and the source and lens redshifts ( for @xmath18 , see eqs . 2 & 3 in garnavich et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the magnification of an extended source is given by , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the point - source magnification at vector position @xmath60 relative to the lens , and the integral is over the area of the source .",
    "for lensing of a uniform circular source of radius @xmath61 by a single point mass with no external shear , the magnification obtains the value @xmath62 $ ] , where @xcite , @xmath63 .",
    "\\label{eqn : aus}\\ ] ] here @xmath64 is the step function and @xmath65 is the angular separation ( impact parameter ) between the source center and the lens in units of the einstein ring radius .    for a uniform source ( as applicable below the synchrotron self - absorption frequency ; see granot et al .  1999b and granot & loeb 2001 ) , the magnification history by a point - mass lens is completely specified by two parameters : @xmath66 and @xmath57 .",
    "figure [ fig : fig2 ] shows the magnification as a function of time in days for @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and two density profiles , uniform ( @xmath69 ) and @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) . at early times",
    "when the source radius is small , the magnification is roughly fixed at its point - source value @xmath72 .",
    "the peak magnification occurs at a time @xmath0 when @xmath73 , i.e. @xmath74 . the total flux from the afterglow is then by , @xmath75 where we have allowed for flux @xmath76 from any unresolved sources not being lensed , e.g.  the host galaxy of the grb .",
    "thus , in the simplest scenario the flux at a given frequency is a function of five parameters : @xmath77 , and @xmath66 .    in order to illustrate how microlensing effectively resolves the image of the grb afterglow , we plot in the fraction of @xmath78 contributed by five equal area annuli as a function of time assuming @xmath79 , and a uniform source . for @xmath80 ,",
    "the annuli contribute roughly equal flux , and the source is not resolved .",
    "however , beginning at @xmath81 different annuli obtain different weights and the lens differentially magnifies the source .",
    "the annulus that contributes most of the flux at a given time has a radius of @xmath82 in units of @xmath55 , where @xmath83 is the radius of that annulus at @xmath84 . defining the fractional radius @xmath85 , @xmath86 from inspection of and ,",
    "it is clear that the the light curve need only be monitored from @xmath0 until @xmath87 to resolve the outer @xmath88 of the radial profile of the afterglow image .",
    "consider an azimuthally symmetric afterglow divided into @xmath89 annuli , with annulus @xmath90 centered at radius @xmath91 .",
    "we assume a self - similar behavior for which both the fractional radii @xmath92 and the mean relative intensity @xmath93 in each annulus @xmath90 are constants in time .",
    "the total flux from the afterglow is simply the sum of the fluxes from each annulus .",
    "the weight of each annulus is in turn the area of the image of each annulus of width @xmath94 , @xmath95 , \\label{eqn : areai}\\ ] ] times the mean intensity of that annulus . converting from an integral to a finite sum",
    ", the total flux is simply , @xmath96 the coefficients one wishes to determine are the @xmath97 relative intensities @xmath98 .",
    "these can be determined through inversion of the observed flux @xmath99 if @xmath100 , and @xmath101 are known .",
    "the functions @xmath102 and @xmath101 in turn depend on the parameters @xmath103 , and @xmath57 .",
    "schematically , the inversion can be done as follows : @xmath104 and @xmath76 can be determined from the late - time ( @xmath105 ) behavior of the afterglow light curve , when the magnification due to microlensing is negligible .",
    "the unlensed flux of the afterglow could then be extrapolated back to @xmath84 , to determine @xmath51 .",
    "the offset between the lensed and unlensed flux at early times @xmath106 then gives @xmath66 .",
    "finally , a measurement of @xmath66 combined with @xmath0 provides @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , all the parameters necessary to invert can ideally be determined without reference to the surface brightness distribution of the source image . in practice , of course , a global fit to all @xmath107 parameters must be done simultaneously , and this will introduce correlations between the parameters @xmath98 and @xmath108 , in turn inflating the errors on the measured values of @xmath98 . while @xmath78 is linearly dependent on @xmath98 ( see ) , this is not true for the parameters @xmath108 .",
    "the nonlinear dependences of these parameters on the observed quantity @xmath78 make the expected errors on these parameters and their covariances with the parameters of interest , @xmath98 , extremely difficult and time consuming to calculate .",
    "furthermore , the errors will depend sensitively on the exact coverage and accuracy of the afterglow photometry .",
    "for an observed microlensing event , a full and careful determination of the errors on the inferred values of @xmath98 must account for their covariances with the other fit parameters .",
    "however , including these effects here is beyond the scope of the paper .",
    "therefore , when computing the error bars on @xmath98 , we will for simplicity assume that @xmath108 are perfectly known . we stress that the errors we derive should thus be regarded as lower limits to the actual errors .",
    "now consider a series of flux measurements @xmath109 that are made at times @xmath110 with errors @xmath111 , and that are fit to .",
    "the parameters of the fit are @xmath112 , and the variances in these parameters are @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the covariance matrix , @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "the fractional errors are then @xmath117 . we assume poisson - noise limited precision , so that @xmath118 .",
    "therefore , for a given set of assumptions about the microlensing event ( @xmath119 ) , the unlensed flux of the afterglow ( @xmath120 ) and the observational setup ( duration of observations , telescope diameter , etc . ) , the covariance matrix @xmath121 can be formed and the expected errors @xmath122 determined .",
    "we now apply the formalism in   [ sec : errors ] to derive an approximate scaling relation for @xmath122 . rather than adopt specific ( and therefore model dependent ) forms for the afterglow flux @xmath51 as a function of frequency and a specific observational setup",
    ", we will simply assume that the instrument being used collects @xmath123 photons per second from the unlensed afterglow at @xmath84 . in  [ sec : discussion",
    "] , we will evaluate values of @xmath123 and thus the errors expected from a specific example of afterglow emission and observational setup . for our fiducial scenario , we assume a uniform source ( @xmath124 ) , a negligible background flux ( @xmath125 ) , and that observations are made continuously from the burst until very late times @xmath105 .",
    "we also assume equal - area annuli , so that all bins have equal weight for a uniform source .",
    "we then calculate @xmath122 for a range of values of @xmath104 , @xmath57 , @xmath66 , and @xmath97 .",
    "numerically , we find the following approximate scaling relation for the fractional errors in the recovered intensity profile , @xmath126 equation ( [ eqn : scale ] ) is the primary result of this paper .",
    "we find that it predicts the expected errors to an accuracy of @xmath127 for most combinations of parameters .",
    "note that , and indeed the majority of the quantitative results in this paper , rely on four assumptions about the afterglow , namely : ( i ) the unlensed flux of the afterglow is a power - law function of time , @xmath128 ; ( ii ) the radius of the afterglow image scales as @xmath16 ; ( iii ) the image profile evolves self - similarly ; and ( iv ) the afterglow image is circularly symmetric .",
    "these assumptions should hold at least approximately for some restricted part of most afterglow light curves .",
    "we discuss these assumptions more thoroughly in ",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the above equations can be used to determine the expected errors on the recovered intensity from observations performed with various instruments , apertures , and photon frequencies of afterglow light curves of arbitrary fluxes and power - law indices . because we have assumed that the observational precision is limited only by photon statistics , that there are no correlations with the other parameters ( see the discussion in  [ sec : errors ] ) , and that the measurements are continuous , equation ( [ eqn : scale ] )",
    "provides the minimum attainable error , at least for uniform sources and isolated lenses with no external shear . in the next section",
    ", we will relax some of the assumptions leading to this result in order to evaluate their effect on the expected errors .",
    "for the two cases of a uniform medium ( @xmath69 ) and a stellar wind medium ( @xmath71 ) , the exponents in are quite similar . therefore",
    ", for the sake of simplicity , we will consider only the uniform medium case with @xmath69 , in the discussion that follows .",
    "several of the terms in can be derived analytically , simply by noting that , according to photon statistics , the errors should scale as @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the number of photons collected .",
    "for example , the scaling with @xmath57 can be derived as follows : the time of the peak of the light curve scales as @xmath131 .",
    "the unlensed flux at this time is @xmath132 .",
    "the magnification structure is independent of @xmath57 ; however , all times are scaled by @xmath133 , so the time over which photons can be collected scales as this factor .",
    "thus the total error should scale as @xmath134 , as found numerically .",
    "the scaling with the impact parameter @xmath66 can be derived in a similar fashion , under the assumption that the peak magnification scales as @xmath135 . however , this is only strictly valid for @xmath136",
    ". therefore , the scaling @xmath137 in is only approximate , and breaks down for @xmath138 .",
    "numerically , we find that for @xmath139 , predicts errors that are too small by @xmath140 for @xmath141 ( the outer 70% of the area of the image ) .",
    "the exponent for the scaling with @xmath97 is @xmath142 , similar to that found by @xcite for resolving the images of galactic stars by microlensing .",
    "naively , one might expect the prefactor in to be considerably smaller : for @xmath143 and @xmath68 the total number of photons collected is of order @xmath144 ( with only a logarithmic dependence on the integration time during which the source is resolved ) .",
    "divided over @xmath145 bins , one might expect the error per bin to be @xmath146 , about an order of magnitude smaller than the @xmath147 predicted by for a radius @xmath148 .",
    "however , the errors increase with @xmath97 faster than one would naively expect , and so the error in each bin is closer to @xmath149 .",
    "the most severe simplification made in deriving is the assumption of continuous measurement from the grb trigger until long after the peak time @xmath0 .",
    "since the optical depth for microlensing is @xmath150 , at least @xmath151 afterglows must be monitored to detect one that has impact parameter @xmath152 .",
    "if it was truly necessary to monitor all of these afterglows continuously to recover the intensity profile accurately , this would represent an overwhelming observational burden .",
    "we therefore evaluate the errors expected under various assumptions about the starting time and the duration of the observations .",
    "we scale the starting time , @xmath153 , and ending time , @xmath154 , in terms of the peak time through the relation @xmath155 , so that for given @xmath153 and @xmath154 , a fixed range of fractional radii , namely @xmath156 through @xmath157 , are probed regardless of the values of @xmath57 and @xmath66 ( see ) .",
    "the top panel of shows the expected errors @xmath122 normalized to the fiducial errors in equation ( [ eqn : scale ] ) , for @xmath158 , corresponding to complete coverage of the microlensing event , and also for @xmath159 ( starting at the peak of the event ) and various values of @xmath154 .",
    "note that here and throughout we plot @xmath122 as a function of @xmath160 , because we assume bins of equal area ( and hence equal weight for a uniform source ; see eq .",
    "[ eqn : areai ] ) .",
    "clearly observations before the peak of the event provide little information on the intensity profile .",
    "moreover , the afterglow need only be monitored until @xmath161 to resolve the outer two thirds of the source radius .",
    "the bottom panel of shows the expected errors when @xmath153 is varied .",
    "delaying observations even somewhat past the peak of the event will result in seriously degraded information .",
    "we conclude that measurements from @xmath0 until @xmath162 will provide almost as much information as continuous measurements from the grb trigger until late times .",
    "since for typical parameters @xmath163 , the afterglow need only be aggressively monitored for about six days .",
    "this suggests the following detection strategy for maximizing the number of lensed grbs for which the intensity profile can be recovered .",
    "since the sampling necessary to determine that the grb is being microlensed is not as dense as that needed to recover the intensity profile , a large number of bursts can be monitored relatively infrequently from a global network of small telescopes . with real - time reduction , this network should be able to `` alert '' microlensing events before or near the peak time .",
    "larger telescopes could then be used to densely sample the microlensed afterglow for the @xmath164 days necessary to resolve the intensity profile .",
    "this is similar to the way galactic microlensing observations are coordinated @xcite .      in this section ,",
    "we explore the effects of realistic intensity profiles on the resultant errors . the optical image of the afterglow is expected to be limb - brightened , because light from the edge of the afterglow suffers the longest time delay , and thus was emitted at earlier times when the fireball was brighter ( waxman 1997c ; sari 1998 ; panaitescu & meszaros 1998 ; granot , piran , & sari 1999a , b ) . the contrast between the center and edge of the afterglow , as well as the sharpness of the cut - off in intensity at the outer edge of the afterglow , depends on the location of the observed frequency relative to the various spectral breaks in the broken power - law spectrum of afterglows ( granot et al .",
    "1999a , b ; granot & loeb 2001 ) .",
    "the exact shape of the relative intensity profile will affect the shape of the light curve , as well as the resultant errors , with the errors expected to be larger near the center ( where the relative intensity is smaller ) than those calculated assuming a uniform source .",
    "previous studies of microlensing @xcite have parameterized the intensity profile as a uniform inner disk bounded by a uniform outer ring , with two parameters specifying the width @xmath165 and contrast @xmath166 of the ring .",
    "of course , realistic intensity profiles do not exhibit such discontinuous features .",
    "the precise calculation of these profiles for the different spectral regimes of grb afterglows is presented elsewhere ( granot & loeb 2001 ) . here , we adopt a parameterized form for the relative intensity profile that captures the qualitative aspects of realistic profiles , @xmath167(1-x^n ) , \\label{eqn : iprof}\\ ] ] where @xmath168 and @xmath169 are free parameters that define the shape of the profile , and @xmath170 is the normalization such that @xmath171 .",
    "the index @xmath169 defines the sharpness of the cut - off , and is roughly analogous to the width of the ring @xmath165 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath168 is related to the intensity at @xmath172 , and is roughly analogous to the contrast @xmath166 .",
    "note that for @xmath173 and @xmath174 , this form reduces to a uniform source .",
    "the top panel of shows @xmath175 for a relatively gradual cutoff , @xmath176 , and various values of @xmath168 .",
    "the bottom panel of shows the fractional errors @xmath177 relative to the fiducial errors for a uniform source in equation ( [ eqn : scale ] ) , given the image profiles shown in the top panel .",
    "note that we normalize the variances @xmath178 to the mean intensity @xmath170 rather than the intensity in that bin in order to avoid the fractional errors @xmath179 blowing up when @xmath180 for large @xmath168 .",
    "in general , the resultant errors are a factor @xmath181 worse than than the uniform source case . in the most extreme example",
    "where @xmath182 at the center of the image , the fractional errors can become quite large , but only for the innermost bin .",
    "for the outer half of the area of the image , the errors can be smaller than the uniform source case .",
    "thus , in this case , measurements will result in a robust upper limit to the intensity at the center of the image , with a clear measurement for the outer part of the image .",
    "therefore the ring - like structure of the image will be accurately recovered .",
    "we have also calculated , but do not show , the errors for the case of a sharp outer cutoff , @xmath183 .",
    "the results for this case are qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the results for @xmath176 . we conclude that realistic intensity profiles will not result in significantly inflated errors relative to the uniform source estimate ( ) , at least for the majority of the source area .",
    "we now consider more complicated models for the lens .",
    "the majority of lenses are likely to reside in galaxies , and a significant fraction of these may be in binary systems . therefore , the assumption of an isolated single lens with no external shear used in the previous sections will not be valid .",
    "we therefore consider two other types of lenses : a single lens with external shear @xcite , and a binary lens @xcite .",
    "the former case is appropriate for a lens perturbed by either a wide binary companion or the potential of its host galaxy .",
    "the latter is appropriate for binary - lenses with separations @xmath184 or smaller .",
    "for a lens residing in a region of high optical depth , i.e. near the center of a galaxy , the magnification structure will not be well approximated as either an isolated lens with external shear or a binary lens . in this case",
    "one may only be able to draw statistical inferences about the surface brightness profile of the source , as it will be difficult to reconstruct the magnification structure of the lens from the light curve alone .",
    "we will not consider this regime here .",
    "we compute the fractional errors in the recovered intensity profiles in the same manner as before , except that we must replace @xmath185 in with the uniform - source magnification appropriate for the given lens model .",
    "we compute this magnification using the inverse ray - shooting method ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) as follows .",
    "the generalized lens equation for point masses and external shear can be expressed in complex coordinates on the plane of the sky as @xcite , @xmath186 where @xmath187 is the complex source position , @xmath188 is the complex image position , @xmath189 is the shear , @xmath190 is the fractional mass of lens component @xmath191 , and @xmath192 is the position of this component . all distances are expressed in units of the angular einstein ring of the combined mass of the system . for a single lens , @xmath193 , @xmath194 , and @xmath195 . for a binary - lens with no external shear , @xmath196 , @xmath197 ,",
    "the mass ratio is @xmath198 , the dimensionless projected separation is @xmath199 , and we choose the origin to be the midpoint of the binary .",

    "these positions are then binned in the source plane .",
    "the magnification of each bin is then just the surface density of rays in the image plane divided by the surface density of rays in the source plane .",
    "since this procedure conserves flux , the resulting magnification map can then be convolved with a source of arbitrary size to compute the magnification of the extended source .",
    "we calculate magnification maps for @xmath200 and @xmath201 , and one binary - lens configuration with @xmath202 and @xmath203 . for the single lens with external shear ,",
    "@xmath204 parameters are needed to specify the light curve , namely : the @xmath89 relative intensities @xmath205 , plus @xmath206 , the shear @xmath189 , and two parameters that specify the position of the grb with respect to the lens , which we denote as @xmath207 . for the binary lens ,",
    "we assume that @xmath196 ; however two additional parameters are needed to describe the topology of the lens , namely @xmath208 and @xmath209 , and so there are a total of @xmath210 parameters .",
    "when calculating the errors on the parameters @xmath205 , we will again assume that all other parameters are perfectly known .",
    "here this assumption is somewhat less justified than the single lens case , not only because there are more parameters , but also because the effects of these parameters are in general not directly related to features in the light curve , and are likely to be subject to degeneracies or correlations , which will inflate the errors in the recovered @xmath205 .",
    "such denegeracies or correlations are known to inflate the errors in limb - darkening measurements of stars using galactic binary - lens events , although not greatly so for well - measured light curves @xcite . in the galactic binary - lens case ,",
    "determination of all parameter combinations that correspond to solutions to the observed light curve , and therefore identification of degeneracies and correlations between fit parameters , is a formidable task @xcite .",
    "this is likely to also be true for grb afterglows .",
    "a comprehensive study of parameter space is beyond the scope of this paper , and so we will simply assume that the binary lens parameters are known .",
    "this assumption facilitates comparison with the isolated single - lens case , which is the main purpose of our discussion here .",
    "we stress that the errors we derive under this assumption are almost certainly underestimates . in both the external shear and binary - lens case",
    ", we will assume a uniform afterglow image ( see mao & loeb 2000 for other examples ) .",
    "in we show the magnification light curves for the case of a single lens with external shear along the @xmath211-axis of magnitudes @xmath212 , and @xmath201 , both for a source centered on the x - axis of the lens , @xmath213 , and a source centered on the y - axis of the lens @xmath214 .",
    "note that the caustics are most highly elongated along the x - axis , and thus for a given @xmath189 , light curves where the source is centered on the x - axis should show more dramatic deviations from the @xmath196 case than for sources centered on the y - axis ( mao & loeb 2000 ) . shows the resultant errors relative to the fiducial error estimate in equation([eqn : scale ] ) . in general , sources centered on the x - axis show more dramatic variations in the expected errors than sources centered on the y - axis . in all cases",
    "the fractional errors are within a factor of @xmath215 of the @xmath196 expectation .",
    "thus , at least for modest values of @xmath216 , we conclude that an external shear will not result in significantly inflated statistical errors , assuming that the covariances with the afterglow and microlensing parameters are small .    in",
    ", we show the magnification as a function of time for the binary lens with @xmath202 and @xmath203 , and a source centered at @xmath217 .",
    "we also show the fraction of total flux contributed by five equal area bins as a function of time . for times",
    "@xmath218 , the light curves resemble that for a single lens ( compare with ) , as the annuli become comparable to or larger than the caustic features .",
    "the bottom panel of shows the resultant errors relative to the fiducial single - lens case .",
    "again , the statistical errors differ by less than a factor of @xmath215 from the fiducial estimate in equation  ( [ eqn : scale ] ) .      observed afterglows often show evidence for a flattening of the light curve to a constant flux at late times .",
    "this is usually interpreted as due to unresolved flux from the host galaxy of the grb . even if the flux from the host galaxy is small",
    ", the sky background will eventually dominate over that of the afterglow .",
    "in other words , it is inevitable that @xmath219 at late times . for ground - based infrared observations ,",
    "the background flux is likely to be larger than the afterglow flux at all relevant times .",
    "a finite background flux will increase the errors on the recovered parameters @xmath205 , and preferentially so for smaller radii , since the information on smaller radii comes at later times , when the background is more significant .",
    "we explore this effect by introducing a background flux which amounts to some fraction of @xmath220 for the afterglow .",
    "shows the expected fractional errors on the recovered intensity profile relative to the fiducial value in equation  ( [ eqn : scale ] ) , assuming a power - law flux index of @xmath143 for the afterglow , for relative background fluxes of @xmath221 , and @xmath222 . at optical - infrared frequencies",
    ", this corresponds to a background of magnitude @xmath223 relative to the ( unlensed ) afterglow at @xmath44 .",
    "as expected , the errors generally increase as the background flux increases , especially for smaller radii . however ,",
    "unless the background flux is higher than @xmath220 , the expected errors are @xmath181 times greater than the fiducial estimate . in other words , for optical frequencies , the background flux should not compromise the measurement of the intensity profile .",
    "however , for , e.g. , ground - based observations in the near - infrared , where the sky background can be many magnitudes brighter than the afterglow flux at 1 day , the accuracy with which the intensity profile can be measured will considerably larger than the fiducial estimate ( ) . thus spaced - based near - infrared observations would improve the accuracy of the recovered intensity profile .      as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : scaling ] , the results we have presented so far are quite general .",
    "we now estimate the errors expected under realistic observational conditions and a realistic model .",
    "to do so , we make estimates of the various terms in by adopting the parameters for the observed afterglow of grb 000301c .",
    "@xcite fit the optical and infrared photometry of grb 000301c to double power - law flux decline magnified by the simple microlensing model of @xcite .",
    "they find best - fit parameters of @xmath224 and @xmath225 for the power - law flux indices , similar to the values found originally by @xcite without including the microlensing modification . for simplicity ,",
    "we ignore the break , and simply adopt a single power - law of slope @xmath226 .",
    "we adopt the best - fit microlensing parameters for the entire dataset of @xmath227 and @xmath228 , somewhat smaller than that found by @xcite . for illustrative purposes",
    ", we will simply adopt the @xcite value of @xmath228 . ] . finally , we extrapolate by eye the unlensed flux of the afterglow back to @xmath229 for the @xmath230 and @xmath231-bands .",
    "table 1 shows the demagnified , extrapolated magnitudes at @xmath84 of the afterglow of grb 000301c , along with the assumed sky brightness , and @xmath232 , the number of photons per second per square meter of collecting telescope area @xmath233 .",
    "note that , for @xmath227 and @xmath228 , the peak of the microlensing event ( for a uniform source ) occurs at @xmath234 .",
    "we calculate the expected errors @xmath179 assuming a 4-m telescope , a seeing of @xmath235 , a uniform source , and observations between the peak , @xmath236 and @xmath237 .",
    "we adopt a uniform source in order to provide a model - independent estimate of the fractional errors expected for realistic observing conditions .",
    "image profiles in the optical and infrared are unlikely to be well - represented by a uniform source @xcite , however this will not affect the errors in the recovered profile by more than a factor of @xmath238 ( see  [ sec : iprofs ] ) .",
    "the results are shown in . for observations in the optical ,",
    "the relative intensity profile can be recovered accurately , @xmath239 . for observations in the infrared , where the sky background is dominant , the expected errors are @xmath5 .",
    "although we do not specifically consider other wavelengths here , we note that radio afterglows peak later and last longer than afterglows at shorter wavelengths ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this , combined with the lower energy of the photons , implies that the photon flux at a given time is larger in the radio than in the optical . at sufficiently high radio frequencies where the effect of scintillations is sub - dominant",
    ", radio observations may provide more accurate measurements of the afterglow image .",
    "since the afterglow image is expected to be different at radio frequencies @xcite , we advocate performing measurements over as wide a range of frequencies as possible .    given that the fraction of afterglows that exhibit microlensing events with impact parameter @xmath152 scales as @xmath240 , it is interesting to consider what kind of errors one would expect for the specific example of grb 000301c considered above , but with larger impact parameters .",
    "we therefore repeat the calculation above with the same parameters , except we now vary the impact parameter . specifically , we consider @xmath241 , and @xmath242 , as would be expected in @xmath243 , and @xmath244 of all grb afterglows . in",
    "we show the results for the @xmath245-band ( where the background is the smallest ) , assuming that observations are taken from peak , @xmath246 until @xmath247 .    for @xmath248 ,",
    "the fractional errors in the recovered intensity profile are @xmath37 for the majority of the area of the image .",
    "thus , it should be possible to recover the intensity profile to an accuracy of @xmath140 for @xmath5 of all afterglows . to test the robustness of this conclusion",
    ", we also show in the results for the @xmath249 case , but considering a band with larger background flux ( @xmath250-band ) , and also a non - zero external shear ( @xmath251 with source on the shear axis ) .",
    "we find that the error is not greatly inflated , @xmath252 .",
    "of course , these results assume that the afterglow can be monitored for many months after the peak of the microlensing event .",
    "practical aspects aside , such monitoring may not be possible even in principle in those cases where the emission is due to a highly collimated jet .",
    "such afterglows will eventually exhibit breaks in the light curve and changes in the image structure when the lorentz factor of the fireball falls below the inverse of the opening angle of the jet . in this case , the errors on the annuli centered at smaller radii would be inflated ( see  [ sec : dobs ] ) .",
    "additional deviations from our results may occur as the fireball decelerates to non - relativistic speeds @xcite .",
    "microlensing offers a unique method for probing the dynamics of grb fireballs . as the grb afterglow image expands , it is differentially magnified by the lens .",
    "different annuli of the image are resolved as they cross the lens position at different times .",
    "thus the light curve of the afterglow during the microlensing event can be inverted to obtain the radial intensity profile @xmath175 , where @xmath253 is the fractional radius of the circular image .",
    "we developed the formalism necessary to calculate the expected fractional errors on the recovered intensity profile @xmath179 .",
    "assuming continuous observations , uniform sources , single lenses , and zero background flux , we find that the expected errors follow a general scaling relation ( eq .",
    "[ eqn : scale ] ) in terms of the afterglow flux , afterglow radius in units of the einstein radius , the angular separation between the afterglow and the lens , and the number of resolution elements in the recovered intensity profile .",
    "we have tested the accuracy of this relation by , in turn , relaxing the assumptions of continuous observations , uniform sources , single lenses , and zero background flux .",
    "we find that , for reasonable choices of the relevant parameters , none of these refinements changes the expected errors by more than a factor of @xmath238 .",
    "therefore , the fiducial scaling relation is fairly robust .",
    "notably , we have found that observations starting at the peak @xmath0 of the microlensing event and ending at @xmath254 result in almost the same accuracy as measurements of the entire afterglow .",
    "therefore , one can monitor frequently _ only _ those afterglows that are significantly microlensed by `` alerting '' to these events before they reach their peak .    finally , we calculated the errors expected for observations in the near - infrared and optical regimes of a specific example .",
    "adopting the observed and inferred parameters for the ( possibly ) microlensed optical / infrared afterglow of grb 000301c , we find that the relative intensity profile can typically be measured with a resolution of 10 and accuracy of @xmath3 in the optical and @xmath4 in the infrared using 4m - class telescopes .",
    "fluctuations in the light curve due to inhomogeneities in the ambient gas distribution are typically small and should not compromise this precision @xcite .    in the course of this study , we have had to make a number of simplifying assumptions . these include : ( i ) the unlensed flux of the afterglow is a power - law function of time , ( ii ) the radius of the afterglow image scales as a power - law of time @xmath16 , ( iii ) the afterglow image is circularly symmetric , ( iv ) the intensity profile is self  similar , i.e. @xmath175 is independent of time , ( v ) the lens resides in a region of relatively low optical depth , and ( vi ) the covariances between the surface brightness profile parameters and the afterglow and microlensing parameters are small .",
    "the first assumption is a generic prediction of the simplest afterglow models , provided that the observed frequency does not cross one of the several spectral breaks , and that @xmath9 is smaller than the collimation angle of the ejecta . when a break in the light curve occurs  either due to the crossing of a spectral break or jet effects",
    " the intensity profile is also likely to change , thus also violating assumption ( iv ) .",
    "when the break is due to jet effects , or when the fireball becomes non - relativistic , then the index @xmath255 of the power - law form for the image radius will change .",
    "furthermore , breaks in the light curve will produce additional uncertainties in the microlensing and afterglow parameters by introducing additional correlations .",
    "for example , in the case of a single power - law flux decline , the impact parameter @xmath66 can be found by extrapolating the late - time light curve ( when the afterglow is not lensed ) to very early times , when the afterglow is lensed by an amount that depends only on @xmath66 .",
    "clearly , this procedure becomes more uncertain when the light curve exhibits a break .",
    "the assumption of circular symmetry may be crude at best , especially for collimated outflows .",
    "for single lenses , it is clear that the information gathered about the surface brightness profile is inherently one  dimensional , and therefore departures from circular symmetry will be difficult to detect .",
    "therefore , the surface brightness profile inferred assuming circular symmetry will be biased . in principle",
    ", binary lenses or single lenses with external shear would provide more information about departures from circular symmetry than a simple single lens ; in practice , however , the additional freedom introduce by the more complex lens models may make extracting this information difficult .",
    "our assumption of small optical depth is likely to hold in the outskirts of galaxies . for sight ",
    "lines passing near the center of an intervening galaxy , the magnification structure of the lens is unlikely to be well  represented by any of the three lenses we considered : an isolated single lens , a single lens with external shear , or a binary  lens . in the high - optical depth regime",
    ", it may be difficult to reconstruct the relative intensity profile directly , due to the complexity of the magnification structure .",
    "finally , the assumption that the covariances between the intensity profile parameters and the afterglow and microlensing parameters are small is unlikely to hold in practice .",
    "this means that the errors we calculate are effectively lower limits to the true errors .",
    "the effects of these various assumptions on the resultant errors on the recovered intensity profile are interesting and important topics for future study .",
    "our basic results are encouraging .",
    "errors of @xmath256 would likely provide very stringent constraints on afterglow models , and even errors of @xmath257 would be interesting ( see fig . 2 in granot & loeb 2001 ) .",
    "errors of the latter magnitude can be obtained from events with larger impact parameters . for the specific afterglow parameters adopted above",
    ", we find errors of @xmath258 in the @xmath245-band for impact parameters in units of @xmath55 of @xmath259 and @xmath260 .",
    "since the number of expected events scales as @xmath240 , this implies that interesting results might be obtained for a significant sample of afterglows .",
    "the forthcoming swift satellite could provide hundreds of afterglow targets per year .",
    "a network of 1 m class telescopes similar to that used in gravitational microlensing searches of the local group @xcite would provide an ideal method for `` alerting '' the community to _ microlensed _ afterglows , which could in turn be intensively monitored to provide information about the structure of the afterglow image .",
    "although this represents a considerable expenditure of resources , the information gained would be invaluable , and furthermore can not be currently acquired by any other method .",
