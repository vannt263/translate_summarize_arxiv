    "statistical physics methods and ideas inherited from studies of disordered systems play an important role in providing theoretical insights and developing low complexity algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems or constraint satisfaction problems  @xcite .",
    "these problems become subjects of interest across a variety of different disciplines such as computer science , discrete mathematics , statistical physics , engineering and computational biology  @xcite .",
    "one archetype that involves both continuous and discrete variables is the network source location problem where we try to find optimal location of sources in a transportation network with an optimal flow pattern .",
    "studies on this source location problem  @xcite are practically relevant to network design and optimization  @xcite and can have widespread applications in the field of operations research  @xcite .    in the source location problem , transportation networks are assumed to be composed of nodes with either a surplus or a deficiency of resources . how to distribute the resources and to replace some deficient nodes by resource providing ones becomes an important problem in network optimization . after the optimization ,",
    "the remaining deficient nodes serve as consumer nodes and a network - wide satisfaction is achieved .",
    "a series of discontinuous transitions with different configurations of the source and consumer nodes  @xcite can be observed by varying model parameters .",
    "two of them are the singlet regime where the consumer nodes are isolated and the doublet regime where the consumer nodes can be paired or isolated . even in the singlet regime , there exist a glassy phase in which optimizing the location of sources becomes algorithmically hard , which is most likely due to the emergence of long range frustrations  @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we apply the entropic cavity method to evaluate the typical value of the ground state entropy in the singlet regime and probe the entropic effects .",
    "the entropic cavity method has been used to compute the ground state entropy of the minimal vertex cover ( mvc ) problem  @xcite and to study entropic effects in the channel coding problem and budget - constrained auctions  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to consider the benefits brought by including the entropic effects properly , especially in terms of solutions ( optimal assignments of source locations ) found by improved message passing algorithms .",
    "hereafter , we identify an assignment to be optimal if it yields the minimal energy cost in a specific regime ( e.g. , the singlet or doublet connection pattern ) . for verification , a standard implementation of the extremal optimization  @xcite",
    "is used to study the energetic properties , and this is adapted as a biased sampling method for the ground states which appears for small systems sufficient to enumerate all the ground states and frozen variables .",

    "the facility location problem is an important problem in management science , since the placement of facilities at optimal positions in a network is able to provide efficient services while minimizing the logistics cost  @xcite",
    ". the services may be public ones that concern the well - being of all citizens , such as ambulance service or public schools , or they may be private ones that concern the sphere of influence and maintenance cost of retailing companies  @xcite .",
    "similar issues exist in wireless sensor networks  @xcite , in which sensors are deployed in an arena for purposes such as surveillance , fire detection , and collection of meteorological and pollution data . due to the limited battery size of the sensors",
    ", minimizing the transportation cost becomes an essential issue to prolong the life span of the networks .",
    "however , the traditional approach to the problem is integer programming , whose complexity scales up rapidly with system size , and solutions for large - scale systems depend on heuristics  @xcite .    in this paper , we consider a transportation network of @xmath1 nodes in which resources are transported through the links , so that the resource demands of all nodes are satisfied .",
    "there are two kinds of nodes .",
    "the _ surplus nodes _ supply the resources and the _ deficient nodes _ have demands for resources . to the _ deficient nodes _",
    "@xmath2 is associated a capacity @xmath3 , corresponding to the amount of resources consumed by @xmath2 , and to the _ surplus nodes _",
    "@xmath2 is associated a sufficiently large capacity @xmath4 , corresponding to the amount of resources it can provide .",
    "this scenario is typical in many modern applications of network traffic optimization , such as logistic networks and sensor networks , where the surplus nodes represent distribution centers in logistic networks or base stations in sensor networks .",
    "the version of the source location problem considered in this paper is an optimization problem in the space of real - valued variables @xmath5 and the boolean variables @xmath6 .",
    "the variables @xmath7 defined over the set of deficient nodes @xmath8 are indicator functions ( @xmath9 true , @xmath10 false ) for an installation , which is a reassignment of a deficient node capacity from @xmath11 to @xmath12 ( making it behave as a surplus node ) . for each link",
    "we also define a real - valued flow @xmath5 ( @xmath13 ) from node @xmath14 to @xmath2 .",
    "those deficient nodes not reassigned ( @xmath15 ) will be called _ consumer nodes _ and will have a net inward flow ; all other nodes are called _ source nodes _ and will have zero , or positive net outward flow . in a valid assignment",
    "either a deficient node @xmath2 must be installed as a source node ( @xmath16 ) , or the flows are required to satisfy the non - negativity constraints of the final resource , defined by @xmath17 for every node , i.e. , @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes neighbors of node @xmath2 . to valid flows and installations",
    "is further associated the energy @xmath20 the task will be to optimize over valid flows and installations to minimize this quantity .",
    "the first term is the total transportation cost summed over each link @xmath21 .",
    "the transportation cost on link @xmath21 is quadratic in the flow .",
    "the quadratic function is chosen because of its convex property , which tends to balance the traffic load among the links ; other convex functions can work equally well  @xcite .",
    "the second term is the installation cost of converting a deficient node to a source node",
    ".    we will be interested in studying an ensemble of diluted networks in which each node has the same degree @xmath22 .",
    "the locations of the surplus and deficient nodes are random , with a fraction of surplus nodes given by @xmath23 , hence capacities are assigned uniformly at random according to the distribution @xmath24 .",
    "other ensembles are certainly interesting , and our analysis can be easily extended to networks with fluctuating degrees ( e.g. , erds - rnyi random networks ) , or with other distributions of @xmath25 .",
    "many interesting phenomena can be exactly analyzed in this restricted setting , with implications for technologically relevant large networks .",
    "it has been previously shown that the optimal set of suppliers ( source locations ) can be obtained by assuming that all deficient nodes are consumer nodes , and then optimizing the nonlinear energy cost function in the space of the real - valued variables @xmath5 given by  @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 if @xmath28 and @xmath29 otherwise . then we identify those nodes with non - negative final resources as the consumer nodes , and naturally assign those nodes with negative final resources to be the source nodes in the optimal solution of the source location problem .",
    "the ground state energy of this model can be analyzed by the cavity method at zero temperature .",
    "previous works  @xcite showed that the cavity energy functions under eq .",
    "( [ cost2 ] ) with continuous variables can be decomposed into composite functions parameterized by their energy minima , such that the recursions of cavity energy functions can be converted to simple recursions of probabilities , which simplifies the analysis a lot .",
    "this simplification is due to the quadratic form of the transportation cost , and thus the composite function captures the multi - valley features of the cavity energy functions .",
    "the authors in refs .",
    "@xcite further found that as the installation cost parameter @xmath30 changes , different configurations of consumer and source nodes appear .",
    "this leads to a cascade of phase transitions in the glassy phase with abrupt jumps of the fraction of source nodes in the optimized network .",
    "for instance , in the singlet regime where @xmath31}$ ] , the consumer nodes are isolated .",
    "this is because in this range , the singly consuming state is always energetically more stable compared with its two neighboring phases , i.e. , all - source phase and doublet phase , as derived in refs .",
    "@xcite and illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ebpfig1 ] ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the simple flow configuration in the singlet regime ( see also appendix  [ sec : cav ] ) allows us to determine the optimal solution easily .",
    "the flow in a link into a consumer node is always @xmath33 , and the flows in other links are @xmath10 .",
    "hence the flow configuration is determined once the nodes are determined to be in the source state or the consumer state .",
    "this further simplifies the source location problem into a discrete - valued optimization .     and",

    "the simple recursion leads to @xmath43 with @xmath44 for the cavity consuming state and @xmath45 for the cavity bistable state and others for the cavity resource providing state .",
    "this equation tells us that a node @xmath2 is in the _ c _ state if its neighbors except node @xmath14 are all in the _ s _ state , and @xmath46 gives the relative cavity energy to the _ s _ state , which is exactly what we shall use in sec .",

    "[ ebpfig2 ] , we remark that they are rigorously based on the cavity derivation described in appendix  [ sec : cav ] .",
    "these results give rise to a belief propagation algorithm  @xcite .",
    "when the fraction of surplus nodes is sufficiently large , it converges satisfactorily and provides excellent agreement with the simulation results in terms of the fraction of source nodes .",
    "however , the algorithm was less satisfactory when the fraction of surplus nodes is not large .",
    "this is the regime where the cavity recursive relations become unstable towards fluctuations or , in the framework of the replica method , where the replica symmetric solution becomes unstable .",
    "one drawback of the previous analysis is that the degeneracy of the cavity source state and the cavity consumer state has been ignored .",
    "algorithmic hardness has also been studied , and is associated with glassy behavior in thermodynamics , which arises from the assignment of nodes with freedom to be resource providers or consumers .",
    "these nodes are called bistable nodes ( fig .  [ ebpfig2 ]",
    "( b ) , see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and often exist in chains , so that when one node in the singlet regime is assigned to be a consumer , its bistable neighbor is then required to be resource providing , and its next nearest neighbor a consumer , and so on .",
    "the correlations of state assignments may be rather long ranged . without the information about",
    "the entropy of the respective states , random assignments of the bistable nodes typically causes contradictions throughout the network .",
    "that is to say , for the bistable nodes , the source and consumer states may not occur with equal probability due to entropic effects , even though their energy contribution is the same . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the cavity bistable state and the cavity source state were grouped together in deriving their recursion relations .",
    "thus the entropy of the ground state was not considered properly . in this paper",
    ", we will compute the entropy of the ground state extending the previous efforts  @xcite , restricting our attention to the _ singlet _ regime .",
    "we will also propose the entropic message passing inspired decimation algorithm and reinforcement strategy to identify the optimal location of sources in both the easy ( replica symmetric ) and hard ( replica symmetry breaking ) phases .",
    "the singlet regime is the focus for application of the methods we develop . in this regime",
    ", the source location problem has an interesting connection with the mvc problem  @xcite if we assume the source nodes as the covered nodes , and the consumer nodes as the uncovered nodes .",
    "the difference is the existence of the surplus ( quenched to the covered state ) nodes as the quenched disorder in the source location problem .",
    "we can see this correspondence by assigning energies @xmath10 and @xmath0 respectively to the covered and uncovered states of a node .",
    "then the cavity recursion relation of the mvc problem can be written as @xmath48.\\ ] ] introducing the transformation @xmath49 , we can verify that the recursion relation of the source location problem implies eq .",

    "in contrast , @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ recsimpfull ] ) takes the values @xmath53 .",
    "this implies that the solutions of the source location problem and the mvc problem are identical only in the ground state .",
    "their excited states yield different energies .",
    "as we shall see , this will lead to different estimates of average energies in the @xmath0rsb ansatz , since the reweighting factors in the @xmath0rsb picture depend on the energies of the excited states .    despite the similarities of the two problems , this paper is motivated by further considerations in the following aspects .",
    "first , our inclusion of surplus nodes as quenched variables arises naturally from realistic considerations . in real applications ,",
    "networks often consist of already installed facilities and the objective is to install further facilities for service improvement ; there is no point to demolish the existing facilities .",
    "second , we will show that care has to be taken in deriving the recursion relations of the cavity probabilities and the expression of the free energy per node .",
    "this is because the energy in the source location problem is distributed both among the nodes and links , while the energy of the minimal vertex cover problem is only defined in terms of the states of the nodes . as we shall see",
    ", this leads to two kinds of cavity analysis , to be referred to as _ reconnection _ and _ restoration _ ( sec .",
    "[ rs03 ] and appendix  [ app : rs02 ] ) .",
    "no such subtleties exist in the vertex cover problem .    compared with previous work calculating the ground state entropy of the vertex cover problem  @xcite",
    ", we will show that the energetic consideration is necessary when we consider replica symmetry - breaking effects , for which metastable states have to be weighted by energetic reweighting factors depending on flows on the links .",
    "furthermore , for future generalizations to more complex scenarios ( such as the doublet regime ) , it is more convenient to develop the method with consideration of the energetic influence of links ( see also a brief description in appendix  [ sec : cav ] ) .",
    "phenomenologically , we will show that the inclusion of quenched surplus nodes produces a rich picture of the optimal states , illustrated by the presence of frozen nodes , and the roles played by frozen hubs and peripheral nodes observed in extremal optimization , and moreover an improved message passing algorithms applicable to single instances .",
    "in this section , we will present the entropic cavity method to compute the ground state entropy of the source location problem at the replica symmetric level and one - step replica symmetry breaking level . at the replica symmetric level",
    ", there exists a single ground state and the clustering hypothesis that the correlation between any two randomly selected nodes in a large sparse network is weak becomes valid .",
    "we derive a closed set of equations involving two messages ( cavity probability and cavity entropy ) .",
    "the replica symmetric ground state entropy can be evaluated from the fixed point of the recursive equations . extending the analysis to one - step replica symmetry broken level is straightforward .",
    "when replica symmetry is broken , the single ground state would split into exponentially many states , which violates the clustering hypothesis .",
    "although the weak correlation assumption is still satisfied in each state , the energy level crossings of states under the cavity iterations should be taken into account .",
    "all mean - field analysis presented here are restricted to the zero temperature limit which selects the ground state .        under the replica symmetric approximation",

    "in this section , we briefly introduce a stochastic local search algorithm named eo algorithm  @xcite to study the statistics of ground state energy and entropy for moderate network size . for convenience in the following analysis , we take @xmath361 for source nodes and @xmath362 for consumer nodes . in the singlet regime , we write an energy cost for the algorithm to minimize as @xmath363 the first term penalizes configurations with excess resource suppliers and the second term penalizes the link whose both ends are occupied by resource consumers . thus minimizing @xmath364",
    "is equivalent to finding the singlet state with maximal number of consumers . as explained in sec .",

    "( [ eo-1 ] ) describes the same set of ground states of eq .",
    "( [ cost2 ] ) in the _ singlet _ regime , but disagrees on all the excitation levels .",
    "this new hamiltonian has discrete energy levels , and high degeneracy of local energy levels , which makes the ranking subroutine in eo more efficient .",
    "the marginal probability of @xmath6 , given all other variables , is described by @xmath365,\\ ] ] where the local field in the ground state has only energetic content , and is given by @xmath366 and @xmath367 .",
    "thus we can define fitness used in the eo algorithm as @xmath368 thus a node with high fitness is favored to minimize the energy cost in eq .",
    "( [ eo-1 ] ) . to find the ground state configurations",
    ", the eo procedure ranks fitness for all nodes and then determines which spin @xmath6 should be flipped , which is described by the following implementation  @xcite .",
    "* initialize randomly @xmath6 for all node @xmath2 and set the corresponding energy @xmath371 ; * for @xmath244 to @xmath372 do : * * select at random a variable according to its fitness rank ( probability of selection follows a power law like @xmath373 where @xmath66 is the variable s rank ) ; * * flip the selected variable and update its fitness , and the fitness of its neighbors ; * * rerank the flipped variable and its neighbors ; * * update the energy ; if the new energy is lower than @xmath371 , reset @xmath371 to be the new energy .",
    "after @xmath369 updates , we have searched a fraction of the configuration space , with a strong bias towards low energy states . if @xmath370 is well chosen and @xmath369 is large enough , we avoid being trapped by a local minimum , but manage to explore many such minima .",
    "@xmath370 should be fixed in the range @xmath374 , closer to one for more challenging energy landscapes , based on theoretical arguments  @xcite . in practice",
    ", @xmath270 has been used .",
    "the value @xmath369 is chosen as @xmath375 where @xmath376 .",
    "we run for small system a fixed large number of trials , which increases asymptotically as @xmath377 for larger systems .",
    "this is exactly the scaling used for the edward anderson problem  @xcite and also working well for the next nearest neighbor ising problem  @xcite . in practice ,",
    "the eo is first run @xmath378 times ( by default , @xmath379 ) from new random initial conditions ; if the ground state energy on run @xmath260 is smaller than that found on all previous runs ( @xmath380 ) , then @xmath378 is reset as @xmath381  @xcite . in this way",
    ", we found that eo searches the space very efficiently from arbitrary initial conditions , and we can have high confidence in the values obtained .",
    "eo not only reaches the ground state once , but resamples different ground states many times . from these visits",
    "we can identify which variables take the same state in a large collection of ground states ( frozen variables ) . to calculate the frozen set of variables we followed in spirit the method laid out by boettcher and percus  @xcite for sampling a range of states with eo ;",
    "our problem is easier given that the symmetry between spin - states is broken . to do this",
    "we allow a sequence of @xmath382 updates from a random initial condition .",
    "in this extended routine , we measure the number of frozen variables , the number of variables that take always the same state in every ground state .",
    "when the first ground state is visited , this number is @xmath1 , then as subsequent ground states are sampled , this value will decrease to its correct asymptotic value . to implement this calculation , we simply store the marginal magnetization @xmath383 averaged over visits to the ground states , for every variable .",
    "the eo is run at a particular value of @xmath370 and a fixed number of iterations @xmath384 ( @xmath385 ) , with the following additional procedures :    * if the new energy of the system is smaller than the current ground state estimate , reset the marginal magnetization to the current configuration , and the size of the frozen set to @xmath1 ; * if the new energy of the system is equal to the current ground state estimate , update magnetizations , and the size of the frozen set is reduced by one once observing a spin whose magnetization is no longer @xmath386 .",
    "the above procedure provides an upper bound on the true number of frozen variables at the identified ground state energy level .",
    "when @xmath370 is well chosen and @xmath384 is large enough , it will identify all frozen variables .",
    "as for the case of energy , we run the algorithm @xmath387 times : if on a run @xmath260 we reduce the ground state energy or decrease the set of frozen variables , we reset @xmath381 .",
    "the set of frozen variables can be systematically improved with each run ; to do this we use the current ground state energy estimate and current list of frozen variables as the initial estimate for subsequent runs .",
    "the above procedure can also be used to evaluate the entropy value .",
    "we must now keep a record of the set of distinct ground states visited ( @xmath388 ) , and only when a new ground state is visited do we append this set .",
    "we first set the number of ground states to @xmath0 and store the current configuration as a ground state in the set @xmath388 .",
    "if we visit all ground states we know @xmath389 .",
    "the eo is run at a particular value of @xmath370 and a fixed number of iterations @xmath390 ( since the time to discover frozen variables is precisely the time required to sample a large fraction of the ground state space , we chose @xmath391 ) , with the following additional procedures :    * if the new energy of the system is smaller than the current ground state estimate , reset @xmath388 to include only the current configuration , and reset the number of the ground states to one ; * if the new energy of the system is equal to the current ground state estimate , check whether the current configuration is in @xmath388 .",
    "if not , the number of ground states increases by one and the current configuration is added into @xmath388 .    in practice",
    ", we run the algorithm @xmath387 times and if on run @xmath260 we decrease the ground state energy , or increase @xmath392 , we reset @xmath381 .",
    "the set @xmath388 is systematically improved with each run by using the current ground state energy estimate and @xmath388 as the initial estimates for subsequent runs . if @xmath370 is well chosen and @xmath390 is large enough , we sample a significant fraction of all ground states on a single run , and hence a lower bound for the true entropy is obtained .",
    "however , for our system we anticipate and observe extensive entropy , but storing and comparing @xmath393 unique ground states is a fundamental limitation on the size of systems we can explore .",
    "we also observe that the time required to visit all ground states grows exponential with system size , however @xmath390 is chosen large enough that for the systems studied this is not a limitation .",
    "it is important to note that the freezing and entropic results do not claim to produce unbiased samples of the frozen set of variables , and ground states . in order to calculate the entropy of the ground state , or the set of frozen variables ,",
    "it is simply necessary to enumerate the ground states and fair sampling is sufficient but not necessary .",
    "simple examples can be constructed to show that eo is a biased sampler of ground states , thus convergence to the correct sets will be non - uniform and possibly inefficient .",
    "however , the empirical success of the energetic method indicates that the algorithm is not trapped or strongly biased , and hence such a scheme can be successful on ensembles where the energetic method works well . as is found empirically , with reasonable runtime for the small systems considered ."
