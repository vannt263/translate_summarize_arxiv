    "this result complements the following results on two other graph modification problems related to planar graphs .",
    "the problem of deciding whether a given graph can be made planar by using at most @xmath0 vertex deletions was proved to be fixed - parameter tractable independently by marx and schlotter  @xcite , who presented a quadratic - time algorithm for every fixed @xmath0 , and by kawarabayashi  @xcite , whose algorithm runs in linear time for every @xmath0 .",
    "kawarabayashi and reed  @xcite showed that deciding whether a graph can be made planar by using at most @xmath0 edge deletions can also be done in linear time for every fixed @xmath0 .",

    "we finish this section by making two remarks that show that we can not apply the techniques that were used to prove fixed - parameter tractability of the vertex deletion and edge deletion variants of planar contraction .",
    "first , a crucial observation in the paper of kawarabayashi and reed  @xcite is that any graph that can be made planar by at most @xmath0 edge deletions must have bounded genus .",

    "then @xmath21 can be made modified into a planar graph by contracting one of the edges in @xmath16 .",
    "however , the genus of @xmath21 is at least the genus of @xmath15 , which is equal to @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "second , the problem of deciding whether a graph can be made planar by at most @xmath0 vertex deletions for some fixed integer @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath0 is not part of the input , is called the @xmath0-apex problem . as observed by kawarabayashi  @xcite and marx and schlotter  @xcite , the class of so - called @xmath0-apex graphs ( graphs that can be made planar by at most @xmath0 vertex deletions ) is closed under taking minors .",
    "this means that the @xmath0-apex problem can be solved in cubic time for any fixed integer @xmath0 due to deep results by robertson and seymour  @xcite .",
    "however , we can not apply robertson and seymour s result on planar contraction , because the class of graphs that can be made planar by at most @xmath0 edge contractions is not closed under taking minors , as the following example shows .",
    "take the complete graph @xmath23 on 5 vertices .",
    "for each edge @xmath24 , add a path @xmath25 from @xmath26 to @xmath27 consisting of @xmath28 new vertices for some integer @xmath29 .",

    "then @xmath30 can be made planar by contracting an arbitrary edge of the original @xmath23 . however ,",
    "if we remove all edges of this @xmath23 , we obtain a minor of @xmath30 that is a subdivision of the graph @xmath23 . in order to make this minor planar , we must contract all edges of a path @xmath25 , so we need at least @xmath31 edge contractions .",

    "let @xmath273 be the subgraph of @xmath2 induced by the vertices in the sets @xmath53 with @xmath274 and the vertices of @xmath95 . since we proved that @xmath273 contains no vertices from @xmath14",
    ", @xmath273 is a subgraph of @xmath5 .",
    "consequently , @xmath273 is planar because @xmath5 is planar . as a result , @xmath134 is planar because @xmath134 can be obtained from @xmath273 by contracting all edges in every set @xmath53 with @xmath274 , and planar graphs are closed under edge contractions . as we have shown that @xmath133 is planar , we are now ready to apply lemma  [ l - combined ] .",
    "this lemma tells us that @xmath134 has an embedding @xmath138 , such that @xmath275 is the boundary of the outer face .",
    "now consider the embedding that we obtain from the ( plane ) graph @xmath122 by removing all vertices that lie inside @xmath257 .",
    "we combine this embedding with @xmath138 to obtain a plane embedding of a graph @xmath276 .",
    "we can obtain @xmath121 from @xmath276 by contracting all edges in @xmath120 that are incident to a vertex in @xmath95 ; recall that @xmath26 and @xmath27 are both in @xmath95 and that @xmath50 is not an edge of @xmath120 . because planar graphs are closed under edge contractions , this means that @xmath121 is planar .",
    "this completes the proof of claim  2 .",
    "we can find the irrelevant edge @xmath50 mentioned just above claim  2 in @xmath99 time . since all other steps took @xmath185 time , we used @xmath185 time so far . after finding the edge @xmath50",
    ", we contract it and continue with the smaller graph @xmath251 .",
    "because removing @xmath14 will make @xmath251 planar as well , we can keep @xmath14 instead of applying theorem  [ t - vertex ] again .",
    "hence , we apply theorem  [ t - vertex ] only once .",
    "because @xmath2 has @xmath1 vertices , and every iteration reduces the number of vertices by exactly one , the total running time of our algorithm is @xmath178 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "a natural direction for future work is to consider the class @xmath3 that consists of all @xmath5-minor free graphs for some graph @xmath5 and to determine the parameterized complexity of @xmath3-contraction for such graph classes .",
    "our proof techniques rely on the fact that we must contract to a planar graph , and as such they can not be used directly for this variant .",
    "hence , we pose this problem as an open problem ."
