    "during the last few years there has been a lot of activity in the study of networks once it was realised that networks of diverse nature exhibit some common features in their underlying structure .",
    "the watts - strogatz ( ws ) model  @xcite was proposed to simulate the small - world feature of real networks ( i.e. , the property that the networks have a small diameter as well as a large clustering coefficient ) . in this model ,",
    "the nodes are placed on a ring and each node has connection to a finite number of nearest neighbours initially .",
    "the nearest neighbour links are then rewired with a rewiring probability @xmath6 to form random long range links",
    ". this model displays phase transitions from a regular to a small world to a random network by varying the single parameter @xmath6 representing disorder .",
    "the regular to small world network transition was shown to take place at @xmath7 . in a slight variation of the ws model ,",
    "the addition type network was considered in which random long range bonds are added with a probability @xmath8 , keeping the nearest neighbour links undisturbed . phase transition to a small world network",
    "was again observed for @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "phase transitions in networks can also be driven by factors other than the above kind of disorder . in many real world networks ,",
    "the linking probability is dictated by factors like euclidean distances separating them , aging etc .",
    "it is possible to achieve phase transitions in the network by tuning the parameters governing such factors .",
    "these networks are indeed not just theoretical concepts .",
    "many real world networks like the internet at the router level , transport networks , power grid network and even collaboration networks are indeed described on a euclidean space in which the geographical locations of the nodes play an important role in the construction of the network @xcite .",
    "similarly , aging factor is important in social networks and citation network @xcite where it is found that linking with older nodes are generally less probable .    in the theoretical modelling of euclidean networks",
    "@xcite , it is usually assumed that two nodes separated by a euclidean distance @xmath10 are connected with the probability @xmath11 which follows a power law variation , i.e. , @xmath12 in one dimension , where the nodes are placed on a ring , the typical networks generated for different values of @xmath5 and the corresponding adjacency matrix are shown graphically in fig .",
    "[ schematic ] .",
    "growing networks on euclidean spaces where the linking probability is modified with such a probability factor have also been considered recently @xcite . in a real situation ,",
    "however , @xmath11 may not have such a well - defined behaviour @xcite .",
    "a variation of @xmath11 in the above form was first studied by kleinberg @xcite on a two dimensional plane with the aim to find out how navigation in the network depends on the paramater @xmath5 .",
    "later , a number of other properties of networks ( both static and dynamic ) with such a probabilistic attachment have been studied @xcite .    in the present study , we have reconsidered a static one dimensional euclidean network ( oen ) with connection probability at distance @xmath10 given by eq  ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "we are interested in the phase transitions which can be achieved by varying the parameter @xmath5 .",
    "although this issue has been addressed earlier  @xcite , there remain some questions about the exact nature of phase transitions in the region @xmath13 .",
    "we have tried to resolve the problems by taking a different approach here . in the earlier studies , the topological features like the diameter , shortest paths and the clustering coeffcient of the network had been studied .",
    "here we have considered ising spins on the nodes of such a network .",
    "the critical behaviour of this system is expected to reflect the nature of the network at different values of @xmath5 indirectly .",
    "that the ising model undergoes phase transitions on the addition type ws network is an established fact  @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that in the small world phase the addition type ws has a mean field nature  @xcite .    in section  [ cs :",
    "neteusp ] , we have reviewed the available results of the euclidean networks and also justified the necessity of the present investigations . in section  [ cs :",
    "isnet ] , studies of ising models on networks have been briefly reviewed .",
    "our results of the study of the ising model on a euclidean network is given in section  [ cs : iseunet ] . finally , in section  [ cs : sumcon ] , summary and conclusions are given .",
    "the one dimensional euclidean network ( oen ) , with the connection probability given by eq ( [ eq1 ] ) , is equivalent to the addition type ws model at @xmath14 when addition of long range links can take place at any length scale .",
    "the choice of the number of long range neighbours in this oen should be such that it allows a phase transition at @xmath14 . in the addition type ws model ,",
    "this transition for a system of @xmath15 nodes is achieved for @xmath16 ( implying @xmath9 in the thermodynamics limit ) .",
    "connection probability @xmath17 implies a total number of @xmath15 long range edges in the system or the existence of one long range bond per node on an average . therefore in order to obtain a phase transition in the oen , it is sufficient to keep @xmath15 long range bonds . for large values of @xmath5",
    "the nodes in the network have short range connections only and therefore it behaves as a regular network  @xcite .",
    "thus there should exist at least one phase transition in this network .    in all , there could be four kinds of behaviour of this network : ( a ) regular : when the network is like a short ranged one dimensional system ( b ) finite dimensional : when the network behaves as a system with effective dimensionality greater than one but still short ranged ( c ) small world and ( d ) random . a few studies in which these phase transitions have been investigated have not been able to give a concrete or unique answer .",
    "the network behaves as a regular network above @xmath18 ; this is obtained in all the earlier studies .",
    "the interesting region is @xmath19 as here the network no longer behaves like a one - dimensional system . in  @xcite ,",
    "the behaviour of the oen was studied by releasing a random walker on the network .",
    "the results indicated that the walker has the same behaviour as on a small world network for all @xmath20 .    to detect whether a network has small world behaviour",
    ", one can calculate the shortest distances separating two nodes , take the average and analyse its behaviour with the system size .",
    "the largest of these shortest paths is called the diameter of the network .",
    "the average shortest path and diameter of a network are expected to have the same scaling behaviour .",
    "sen and chakrabarti  @xcite studied the diameters of the oen while the shortest paths were calculated by moukarzel and de menezes  @xcite giving contradictory results . in  @xcite",
    ", it was found that the diameter behaved as @xmath21 on chains of size @xmath15 for all @xmath20 and hence it was concluded that small world behaviour occurs for @xmath19 while in  @xcite , it was argued that small world behaviour occurs only for @xmath22 . in the region",
    "@xmath23 , according to @xcite , the shortest distances scale as @xmath24 with the value of the shortest path exponent @xmath25 depending on @xmath5 .",
    "the system sizes considered in  @xcite were much larger compared to those in  @xcite and the discrepancy of the results could be accounted for by this fact .",
    "it must also be mentioned here the above results are for @xmath26 , results for other values of @xmath8 have also been considered in these studies .",
    "random and small world phases can be distinguished by the clustering coefficient which remains finite in the latter .",
    "the estimate of the clustering coefficients of the present network  @xcite showed that below @xmath27 it vanishes .",
    "this was considered to be a signature of the network being random for @xmath22 and based on the findings of @xcite , it was concluded that the region @xmath2 was equally divided into a random ( for @xmath22 ) and a small world ( for @xmath28 ) phase .",
    "but this is by no means foolproof as in this particular network the clustering coefficient is bound to be small close to @xmath29 as the number of nearest neighbour is small when @xmath5 is small .",
    "( in the original ws model , the clustering coefficient remained high for finite values of @xmath30 only when the number of nearest neighbours was at least four to begin with . )",
    "thus it may not indicate a random to small world phase transition at @xmath31 as conjectured in  @xcite , it could , in principle , correspond to the small world to a finite dimensional network as found in  @xcite . that there could be two transitions , one at @xmath32 and the second at @xmath18",
    "was also supported by simple scaling arguments for the average bond lengths @xcite .",
    "it has been mentioned in the beginning of this section that the the total number of random long range bonds per site has been kept equal to @xmath33 on an average such that @xmath17 .",
    "this is also consistent with the fact that such a choice will keep the probability normalised .",
    "however , in an analytical approach there will be a problem at @xmath32 where such a normalisation is not possible .",
    "this issue has been discussed in  @xcite and does not cause a problem in numerical calculations .",
    "navigation or searching on small world networks are known to give rise to shortest paths which do _ not _ behave as @xmath34 but rather have sublinear variations with @xmath15 except for special points : this was first detected in  @xcite for two dimensional lattices and later confirmed for the ws model  @xcite . in the present one dimensional euclidean model this was again demonstrated in  @xcite .",
    "the more recent results  @xcite indicate that there is indeed a phase transition at @xmath27 and that the network behaves as a small world only for @xmath22 . in the present work we want to confirm this using a completely different approach . if the network s behaviour is that of a small world it should be reflected in the critical exponents of the ising model which would assume mean field values .",
    "on the other hand , if it behaves like a finite dimensional system with effective dimension greater than one , a phase transition will be observed with critical exponents assuming values different from the mean field ones ( note that the lower critical dimension of the ising model is 1 ) .",
    "another interesting point which can be studied by considering the ising model on this network is the relation between the shortest path exponent @xmath35 and the effective dimension of the network for @xmath36 .",
    "if one interprets @xmath35 as the inverse of some effective dimension , @xmath37 , then , according to  @xcite , for some values of @xmath28 , @xmath37 is actually greater than 4 .",
    "in fact we have used the burning algorithm @xcite to find out independently the shortest paths between _ all _ pairs of nodes in network of size @xmath15 and found out that indeed @xmath35 has values below 0.25 upto @xmath38 ( fig .",
    "[ shortpath ] ) .",
    "our estimates of @xmath39 are slighlty larger than those obtained in  @xcite , which may be due to the smaller system size considered , but still we find @xmath40 over a considerable range of values of @xmath28 .",
    "the question that naturally arises is whether the ising model shows mean field behaviour here as the effective dimension is higher than the upper critical dimension , i.e. , does it have a mean field behaviour even though the network is not a small world ?",
    "ising models with long range neighbours have been considered in different contexts in many earlier studies .",
    "it is well known that the short ranged ising model on a one dimensional lattice does not show any phase transition while interaction with all the neighbours gives rise to a mean field like phase transition .",
    "the occurrence of the random long ranged bonds , also enables a phase transition  @xcite .    in a analytical study of the ising model on a ws type network",
    ", it was assumed that there are two nearest neighbours and additional long range neighbours occur randomly with probability @xmath41  @xcite where @xmath42 is a parameter .",
    "phase transition occurs here for @xmath43 implying that the addition of one long range bond to each node , ( on an average ) could enhance a phase transition . in the numerical studies",
    "also , the addition of one random long range neighbour per site enables a phase transition  @xcite . the fact that the ising model on these networks show a phase transition even when the additional long range connections are finite in number ( i.e. , @xmath44 ) compared to that of the the infinite range model ( where there are @xmath45 number of bonds ) is an evidence of the key role played by the randomness in these networks @xcite .",
    "another kind of long range ising model has been considered in which the interactions decrease with the distance as a power law , i.e , the hamiltonian is given by  @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 ; @xmath48 is the distance separating the spins at site @xmath49 and @xmath50 . in the fully connected model ,",
    "phase transitions occur at the values @xmath51 and @xmath52 ; for @xmath53 , the system is meanfield like while for @xmath54 it is like a finite dimensional lattice and for @xmath55 , it behaves like a one dimensional system with no phase transition . on a small world network ,",
    "the interactions exist randomly among neighbours , maintaining the form of @xmath56 as above .",
    "however , there is no phase transition displayed by this model  @xcite except at @xmath57 where it coincides with the ws model .    as mentioned earlier",
    ", the critical behaviour of ising model on a ws addition type network is mean field type .",
    "the intriguing feature is the validity of the finite size scaling analysis in the mean field regime .",
    "moreover , it has been observed  @xcite that the data collapse in the finite size scaling analysis can be achieved when @xmath58 , the deviation from the critical temperature is scaled by the factor @xmath59 in the scaling argument with @xmath60 . interpreting @xmath61 as @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the critical exponent for the correlation function and @xmath64 the effective dimensionality of the system , this",
    "could imply that one has effectively a system with @xmath65 with the mean field value of @xmath66 .",
    "this effective dimension is identical to the upper critical dimension of the ising model .",
    "phase transition of the ising model has also been observed in scale - free networks  @xcite where the transition temperature diverges with the system size .",
    "several other aspects of ising models on networks have been considered recently , for example the self - averaging property of ising model on networks@xcite , quenching dynamics @xcite etc .",
    ", which are not directly related to the content of the present paper .",
    "we have considered an ising model on a finite chain of length @xmath15 with periodic boundary condition .",
    "the nodes are assigned position coordinates @xmath67 along the chain .",
    "each node is connected to its two nearest neighbours . in order to generate the long range bonds ,",
    "two nodes are selected randomly .",
    "if @xmath68 is the distance separating them , they are connected with probability @xmath11 as given by eq ( 1 ) .",
    "the process is repeated @xmath69 times generating @xmath15 long range bonds ( each bond is counted twice so that there are @xmath15 long range bonds in the system ) .",
    "this ensures that there is one long range neighbour for each site on an average . as has been mentioned in the previous section ,",
    "this is sufficient to achieve a phase transition . for each realisation of the network , the dynamical evolution from a uniform state (",
    "all spins up ) was allowed following a metropolis algorithm for different temperatures @xmath70 .",
    "we have computed the following quantities on this network after it reaches equilibrium :    * _ magnetisation per spin  _ @xmath71 * _ binder cumulant  _ @xmath72 . * _ susceptibility per spin _ is calculated from the fluctuation of the order parameter : @xmath73\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is the total magnetisation , @xmath70 is the temperature and @xmath75 the boltzmann s constant . *",

    "we estimate @xmath79 and a data collapse is obtained by plotting @xmath78 vs @xmath80 . with this value of @xmath61",
    ", one can now estimate the exponents @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , the critical exponents for the order parameter @xmath84 , susceptibity @xmath85 and specific heat @xmath86 respectively using finite size scaling .",
    "figures [ delta06all ] and [ delta14all ] show the data collapse for these quantities for @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "similar results have been obtained for other values of @xmath5 .",
    "as expected we find a transition temperature @xmath79 which decreases with @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "[ tcvsdelta ] ) .",
    "@xmath79 varies very slowly in the region @xmath89 and much faster for higher values of @xmath5 .      from the finite size scaling analysis , we obtain the critical exponents @xmath90 and @xmath83 ( figs [ barnualphavsdelta],[betagammavsdelta ] ) .",
    "we find that @xmath61 is equal to 2 for the entire range @xmath3 .",
    "however , for @xmath28 we find that @xmath61 decreases and then rises again .",
    "the magnetisation exponent @xmath91 is equal to 0.5 for @xmath22 , while for @xmath92 , it decreases with @xmath5 .",
    "the susceptibility exponent @xmath82 is close to 1 for @xmath22 and increases with @xmath5 beyond @xmath27 .",
    "the specific heat exponent @xmath83 remains constant at a value close to 0.1 for @xmath22 and appears to deviate from this value as @xmath5 is made larger than @xmath33 .",
    "it becomes small as @xmath5 approaches 2 .",
    "the behaviour of all the quantities are consistent with the fact that for @xmath22 , there is a mean field behaviour of the ising model ( consistent with the available solution for the random long - range bond small world network @xcite ) and for @xmath28 , its behaviour is like a finite dimensional lattice with effective dimension greater than one .    as has been argued for @xmath93 , here",
    "also one can interpret @xmath61 as @xmath62 , where @xmath64 is the effective dimension , such that it satisfies @xmath94 .",
    "since below @xmath65 @xmath83 is nonzero , @xmath61 decreases from 2 at @xmath28 .",
    "theoretically , the behaviour of @xmath83 is non - monotonic as a function of dimensionality @xmath64 as @xmath64 varies from 4 to 1 ; @xmath83 is zero for both @xmath65 and @xmath95 and this behaviour is reflected in the fact that @xmath61 again rises to 2 at around @xmath96 .",
    "however , our result for @xmath83 does not show this non - monotonic behaviour very accurately , the reason possibly being that the magnitude of @xmath83 is small ( @xmath97 ) even when it is non - zero and is difficult to estimate accurately in a numerical study .",
    "mean field value for @xmath82 is 1.0 which comes out to be slightly lower in our estimate and also the value of @xmath83 is higher than the corresponding @xmath98 , but the scaling relation @xmath99 is obeyed with a high degree of accuracy .",
    "although there are deviations of @xmath83 and @xmath82 from the mean field values , the fact remains that they show no variation over the region @xmath3 , indicating that the critical behaviour for @xmath100 is identical to that for @xmath93 , which is known to be mean field like .",
    "our results confirm that the network behaves as a finite dimensional system in the region @xmath101 .",
    "however , the finite size scaling analysis of various quantities in the ising model does not allow the estimation of @xmath64 and @xmath63 independently .",
    "it may be expected that the behaviour of the average shortest path should give us some idea about the effective dimension .",
    "however , as we argue below , it is not possible .",
    "the estimate of the exact average shortest path is consistent with the mean field picture for @xmath22 as it shows a logarithmic increase with @xmath15 ( small world effect ) .",
    "as mentioned before , for @xmath28 , it has a power law increase @xmath102 and we have a region where @xmath40 .",
    "so if one interpretes @xmath39 as a inverse dimension , the dimensionality is greater than 4 here . even then , the ising model does not show mean field behaviour here . from this",
    "we conclude that although there is an effective dimension coming out from the topological behaviour of the network , it does not exactly act as the spatial dimension as far as physics of ising model is concerned .",
    "[ tab : epsexp ]    .table showing the effective dimension and comparative values of @xmath62 from @xmath103 expansion ( ee ) and @xmath104 from finite size scaling ( fss ) analyses . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we adopt a different approach to estimate @xmath63 and @xmath64 which works well for @xmath5 close to 1 .",
    "the behaviour of the critical exponents is fully consistent with the fact that the effective dimensionality @xmath64 decreases as @xmath105 is made larger than 1 ( e.g. , the value of @xmath82 increases while that of @xmath91 decreases ) .",
    "in order to find out @xmath64 , we use the epsilon expansions of @xmath83 , @xmath91 and @xmath82 to first order , each of which gives an independent estimate of @xmath106 : @xmath107 ideally , all three estimates should give similar value of @xmath103 , but here we have used the expansions upto linear terms only and the estimates may not agree very well ( especially for the estimate from @xmath83 and to some extent , that from @xmath82 ) .",
    "it is not very convenient to use the expansions to higher degrees also . to take care of this fact , we take @xmath108 , the average of the above three estimates of @xmath109 , and use it to find out the value of @xmath63 from the equation @xmath110 thus an estimate of @xmath62",
    "is obtained which can be compared to @xmath61 obtained from the finite size scaling .",
    "we see that when @xmath111 is small , the agreement is nice ( table 1 ) . naturally , when @xmath5 is considerably away from @xmath33 , the effective dimensionality decreases and the epsilon expansions are not much useful here , particularly for @xmath83 and @xmath82 .",
    "this is reflected in the mismatch of the estimates from epsilon expansion and the finite size scaling analysis for @xmath112 and @xmath96 .",
    "we have investigated the behaviour of the ising model on a one dimensional network in which there are links to random long range neighbours existing with a probability which varies inversely with the distance along the original chain following eq ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the effective dimensionality of the network deviates from 1 continuously as @xmath5 is made smaller than 2 and a finite temperature phase transition is observed .",
    "the transition temperature increases as @xmath5 is made smaller and the critical exponents vary with @xmath5 as the dimensionality changes .",
    "the results show that there is a mean field behaviour for @xmath22 and a finite dimensional behaviour for @xmath101 . in the mean field regime ,",
    "the finite size scaling analysis works with an effective dimensionality four , the upper critical dimension of the ising model .",
    "the present study confirms the conclusion made in @xcite that the small world behaviour of the underlaying network exists for @xmath22 only .",
    "our results also show that the effective dimensionality can not be simply extracted from the behaviour of the shortest paths on this network although the latter shows a power law behaviour with the number of nodes .",
    "we have used an alternative method to estimate the effective dimensionality which works quite well for @xmath5 close to 1 .",
    "the present study was conducted to address certain issues related to the topology of a network but the study of phase transition of ising model on networks has its own inherent interest as the ising model has got wide applications in many interdisciplinary areas .",
    "for example , the study and nature of phases in such models gives us important insight into social opinion dynamics @xcite in closely knit populations , where the networks look very similar to the models discussed here , and opinions being modelled as states of spin vectors at each site .",
    "here one first selects a site , say @xmath113 , and ` burns ' its neighbours which form a set @xmath114 .",
