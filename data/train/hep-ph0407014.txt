    "since the discovery of the @xmath0 meson in 1974 , charmonium has provided a useful laboratory for quantitative tests of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and , in particular , of the interplay of perturbative and nonperturbative phenomena .",
    "the factorization formalism of nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite provides a rigorous theoretical framework for the description of heavy - quarkonium production and decay .",
    "this formalism implies a separation of short - distance coefficients , which can be calculated perturbatively as expansions in the strong - coupling constant @xmath5 , from long - distance matrix elements ( mes ) , which must be extracted from experiment .",
    "the relative importance of the latter can be estimated by means of velocity scaling rules ; i.e. , the mes are predicted to scale with a definite power of the heavy - quark ( @xmath6 ) velocity @xmath7 in the limit @xmath8 . in this way ,",
    "the theoretical predictions are organized as double expansions in @xmath5 and @xmath7 .",
    "a crucial feature of this formalism is that it takes into account the complete structure of the @xmath9 fock space , which is spanned by the states @xmath10 with definite spin @xmath11 , orbital angular momentum @xmath12 , total angular momentum @xmath13 , and colour multiplicity @xmath14 .",
    "in particular , this formalism predicts the existence of colour - octet ( co ) processes in nature .",
    "this means that @xmath9 pairs are produced at short distances in co states and subsequently evolve into physical , colour - singlet ( cs ) quarkonia by the nonperturbative emission of soft gluons . in the limit @xmath15 , the traditional cs model ( csm ) @xcite is recovered .",
    "the greatest triumph of this formalism was that it was able to correctly describe @xcite the cross section of inclusive charmonium hadroproduction measured in @xmath16 collisions at the fermilab tevatron @xcite , which had turned out to be more than one order of magnitude in excess of the theoretical prediction based on the csm .",
    "apart from this phenomenological drawback , the csm also suffers from severe conceptual problems indicating that it is incomplete .",
    "these include the presence of logarithmic infrared singularities in the @xmath17 corrections to @xmath18-wave decays to light hadrons and in the relativistic corrections to @xmath11-wave annihilation @xcite , and the lack of a general argument for its validity in higher orders of perturbation theory .",
    "while the @xmath19-factorization @xcite and hard - comover - scattering @xcite approaches manage to bring the csm prediction much closer to the tevatron data , they do not cure the conceptual defects of the csm .",
    "the colour evaporation model @xcite , which is intuitive and useful for qualitative studies , also significantly improves the description of the tevatron data as compared to the csm @xcite .",
    "however , it does not account for the process - specific weights of the cs and co contributions , but rather assumes a fixed ratio of @xmath20 . in this sense , a coequal alternative to the nrqcd factorization formalism is presently not available .    in order to convincingly establish the phenomenological significance of the co processes , it is indispensable to identify them in other kinds of high - energy experiments as well .",
    "studies of charmonium production in @xmath21 photoproduction @xcite , @xmath21 @xcite and @xmath22 @xcite deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) , @xmath4 annihilation in the continuum @xcite , @xmath23-boson decays @xcite , @xmath1 collisions @xcite , and @xmath24-hadron decays @xcite may be found in the literature ; for reviews , see ref .",
    "furthermore , the polarization of @xmath3 mesons produced directly @xcite and of @xmath0 mesons produced promptly @xcite , i.e. , either directly or via the feed - down from heavier charmonia , which also provides a sensitive probe of co processes , was investigated .",
    "until recently , none of these studies was able to prove or disprove the nrqcd factorization hypothesis .",
    "however , h1 data of @xmath25 in dis at the desy hadron electron ring accelerator ( hera ) @xcite and delphi data of @xmath26 at the cern large electron positron collider ( lep2 ) @xcite provide first independent evidence for it @xcite .    the verification of the nrqcd factorization hypothesis is presently hampered both from the theoretical and experimental sides .",
    "on the one hand , the theoretical predictions to be compared with existing experimental data are , apart from very few exceptions @xcite , of lowest order ( lo ) and thus suffer from considerable uncertainties , mostly from the dependences on the renormalization and factorization scales and from the lack of information on the nonperturbative mes . on the other hand ,",
    "the experimental errors are still rather sizeable .",
    "the latter will be dramatically reduced with the upgrades of hera ( hera ii ) and the tevatron ( run ii ) and with the advent of cern lhc and hopefully a future @xmath4 linear collider ( lc ) such as the tev - energy superconducting linear accelerator ( tesla ) , which is presently being designed and planned at desy . on the theoretical side ,",
    "it is necessary to calculate the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) corrections to the hard - scattering cross sections and to include the effective operators which are suppressed by higher powers in @xmath7 .    in this paper , we take a first step in this comprehensive research programme , by studying the inclusive production of @xmath0 mesons in high - energy @xmath1 collisions .",
    "as mentioned above , this process was studied at lep2 @xcite , where the photons originated from hard initial - state bremsstrahlung . at high - energy @xmath4 lcs ,",
    "an additional source of hard photons is provided by beamstrahlung , the synchrotron radiation emitted by one of the colliding bunches in the field of the opposite bunch .",
    "the highest possible photon energies with large enough luminosity may be achieved by converting the @xmath4 lc into a @xmath1 collider via back - scattering of high - energetic laser light off the electron and positron beams .    in order for a @xmath0 meson to acquire finite transverse momentum ( @xmath27 )",
    ", it must be produced together with another particle or a hadron jet ( @xmath28 ) . from coupling and",
    "phase - space considerations it is evident that @xmath0 plus jet associated production yields the dominant contribution . in the following , we thus consider the process @xmath29 , where @xmath30 denotes the hadronic remnant possibly including a second jet . here",
    ", we take @xmath28 and @xmath30 to be free of charm assuming that charmed hadrons or charmonia besides the @xmath0 meson would be detectable . the process @xmath31 , where @xmath32 represents a prompt photon , will be considered in a forthcoming publication @xcite .",
    "the incoming photons can interact either directly with the quarks participating in the hard - scattering process ( direct photoproduction ) or via their quark and gluon content ( resolved photoproduction ) .",
    "thus , the process @xmath29 receives contributions from the direct , single - resolved , and double - resolved channels .",
    "all three contributions are formally of the same order in the perturbative expansion",
    ". this may be understood by observing that the parton density functions ( pdfs ) of the photon have a leading behaviour proportional to @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the fine - structure constant , @xmath35 is the factorization scale , and @xmath36 is the asymptotic scale parameter of qcd . in the following ,",
    "we focus our attention on the direct channel .",
    "the other channels are left for future work .",
    "the @xmath0 mesons can be produced directly ; or via radiative or hadronic decays of heavier charmonia , such as @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons ; or via weak decays of @xmath24 hadrons .",
    "the respective decay branching fractions are @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath24 hadrons can be detected by looking for displaced decay vertices with dedicated vertex detectors , and the @xmath0 mesons originating from their decays can thus be treated separately .",
    "therefore and because of the smallness of @xmath42 , @xmath0 production through @xmath24-hadron decay is not considered here .",
    "the cross sections of the four residual indirect production channels may be approximated by multiplying the direct - production cross sections of the respective intermediate charmonia with their decay branching fractions to @xmath0 mesons .",
    "to summarize , the goal of the present analysis is to calculate the inclusive cross section of @xmath26 in direct photoproduction for finite values of @xmath27 at nlo within nrqcd allowing for the @xmath0 meson to be promptly produced .",
    "the lo result , also including the single- and double - resolved contributions , may be found in refs .",
    "@xcite and the references cited therein .",
    "the leading relativistic correction , which originates from the @xmath43 fock state @xmath44 and is of @xmath45 relative to the lo result , was evaluated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that paper , also @xmath0 plus dijet associated production in two - photon collisions was studied for direct photoproduction and direct @xmath0 production .",
    "the @xmath46 partonic cross sections obtained therein constitute a starting point for the evaluation of the real radiative corrections in our present study .",
    "they have to be complemented with the corresponding results for direct @xmath2 production . furthermore , the kinematic cuts imposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to separate the final - state objects have to be removed .",
    "this yields soft and collinear singularities , which are collectively denoted as infrared ( ir ) singularities .",
    "on top of this , the virtual radiative corrections , which arise from @xmath47 feynman diagrams bound state is considered as one particle . ]",
    "involving closed loops , have to be added .",
    "they involve ir , ultraviolet ( uv ) , and coulomb singularities .",
    "the cancellation of all these singularities is nontrivial and requires the uv renormalization of masses , couplings , and wave - functions ; the redefinition of nrqcd mes so as to absorb ir and coulomb singularities ; the factorization of initial - state collinear singularities in photon pdfs ; and the operation of the kinoshita - lee - nauenberg theorem @xcite on the cancellation of final - state ir singularities .",
    "apart from being of general phenomenological relevance , our analysis should thus also be of conceptual interest for the theoretical heavy - quarkonium community .",
    "after all , this is the first time that the full nlo corrections are evaluated for an inclusive @xmath47 process within the nrqcd framework .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : ana ] , we describe our analytical calculation in some detail .",
    "specifically , we discuss the structure of the various types of singularities and the mechanisms by which they are removed .",
    "lengthy expressions are relegated to the appendix . in section  [ sec : num ] , we present our numerical results appropriate for the @xmath4 mode of tesla , and discuss their phenomenological implications .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section  [ sec : con ] .",
    "we start this section with a few general remarks . in our analytic calculation , we take the colour gauge group to be su(@xmath48 ) with a generic value of @xmath48 , which is put equal to 3 in our numerical analysis . colour factors appearing in our formulas include @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "we work in the fixed - flavour - number scheme , with @xmath53 active quark flavours @xmath54 , which we treat as massless .",
    "the charm quark @xmath55 and antiquark @xmath56 , with mass @xmath57 , only appear in the final state .",
    "we denote the fractional electric charge of quark @xmath58 by @xmath59 .",

    "( [ eq : sum ] ) is independent of the cut - off parameters @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "specifically , the @xmath64 dependence cancels between @xmath66 and @xmath67 and the @xmath65 dependence among @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath67 .",
    "while @xmath68 , @xmath66 , and @xmath69 are known in analytic form , the phase - space integrals occurring in the evaluation of @xmath67 are rather cumbersome and are thus solved numerically .",
    "consequently , the cancellation of @xmath64 and @xmath65 has to be established numerically , too .",
    "the goodness of this cancellation is assessed in section  [ sec : num ] .    the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sum ] ) is independent of the renormalization scales @xmath70 and @xmath71 up to terms that are formally beyond nlo ; this cancellation is not exact because the running of @xmath72 and @xmath73\\rangle_r(\\lambda)$ ] is determined from the respective renormalization group equations , which resum logarithmic corrections to all orders .",
    "however , the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sum ] ) depends on the factorization scale @xmath35 already in nlo ; this @xmath35 dependence is cancelled up to terms beyond nlo once the cross section of single - resolved photoproduction , which depends on @xmath35 through the photon pdfs @xmath74 , is added .",
    "if @xmath35 is to be varied , this must thus be done simultaneously in the cross sections of direct and single - resolved photoproduction .",
    "we are now in a position to present our numerical analysis of the inclusive production of prompt @xmath0 mesons in two - photon collisions with direct photon interactions at nlo in the nrqcd factorization framework .",
    "we consider tesla in its @xmath4 mode with @xmath75  gev , where the photons are produced via bremsstrahlung and beamstrahlung .",
    "the discussion of the numerical analysis proceeds in three steps .",
    "we first specify our input parameters .",
    "we then verify that our numerical evaluation is independent of the technical cut - off parameters @xmath64 and @xmath65 and assess its dependence on the renormalization and factorization scales @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath35 .",
    "finally , we explore the phenomenological consequences of our analysis by studying the size and impact of the nlo corrections on the @xmath27 and @xmath76 distributions of the cross section .",
    "we use @xmath77  gev and @xmath78 . for direct photoproduction at nlo ( lo )",
    ", we employ the two - loop ( one - loop ) formula for @xmath79 @xcite with @xmath53 active quark flavours and @xmath80  mev ( 204  mev ) @xcite .",
    "we use the photon pdfs from glck , reya , and schienbein ( grs ) @xcite , which are the only available ones that are implemented in the fixed - flavour - number scheme , with @xmath53 .",
    "when we combine the contribution due to single - resolved photoproduction , which is so far only known at lo , with the nlo one due to direct photoproduction , then we nevertheless evaluate it using the nlo formula for @xmath79 and the nlo set of the grs photon pdfs so as to maximize the compensation of the @xmath35 dependence . in order to render this choice fully consistent",
    ", we will have to include the nlo correction to the single - resolved contribution and also the double - resolved contribution at nlo , once they become available .",
    "on the other hand , we consistently evaluate the single - resolved contribution using the lo formula for @xmath79 and the lo set of the grs photon pdfs when we consider it separately or in combination with the direct contribution at lo .",
    "our default choice of renormalization and factorization scales is @xmath81 and @xmath82 . in want of nlo sets of @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 mes",

    "therefore , we refrain from presenting a full - fledged quantitative estimate of the theoretical uncertainties .",

    "our default values for the rest of the numerical analysis are @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",

    "furthermore , we observe from fig .  [",

    "the one that is defined as the ratio of the nlo and lo results of direct photoproduction ( solid lines ) was already discussed above .",

    ", this definition of @xmath128 factor is slightly inconsistent and the resulting values should , therefore , be taken with a grain of salt .",
    "since the lo result of single - resolved photoproduction dominates both numerator and denominator of this @xmath128 factor , the latter takes moderate values .",
    "the fact that these values are even below unity in the considered regions of phase space is due to the different choices of @xmath79 and the photon pdfs for the single - resolved contribution in the numerator and denominator of this @xmath128 factor .",
    "in the case of charmonium , the experimental verification of the nrqcd factorization hypothesis in two - photon collisions at lep2 , photoproduction at hera , and hadroproduction at the tevatron has now practically come to a halt , one reason being that the available theoretical predictions for the production of prompt @xmath0 mesons with finite values of @xmath27 in high - energetic photon - photon , photon - hadron , and hadron - hadron collisions are only of lo and thus suffer from considerable uncertainties , mostly from the dependences on the renormalization and factorization scales and from the lack of information on the nonperturbative mes .",

    "we worked in dimensional regularization in connection with the @xmath129 renormalization and factorization schemes , so that our nlo result depends on the qcd and nrqcd renormalization scales @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively , and on the factorization scale @xmath35 connected with the collinear splitting of the incoming photons into massless @xmath130 pairs .",
    "while the @xmath70 and @xmath71 dependences are formally cancelled up to terms beyond nlo within direct photoproduction , the @xmath35 dependence is only compensated by the lo cross section of single - resolved photoproduction . by the same token , the strong @xmath35 dependence of the latter is considerably reduced by the inclusion of our new result .",
    "this is a crucial phenomenological merit of our work , as may be appreciated by observing that , at lo , the overwhelming bulk of the cross section of prompt @xmath0 production in two - photon collisions is due to single - resolved photoproduction @xcite .",
    "the @xmath128 factor of direct photoproduction turned out to be very substantial at large values of @xmath27 because fragmentation - prone channels start to open up at nlo [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : k](a ) ] .",
    "in fact , at @xmath119 , the @xmath27 distribution of direct photoproduction at nlo is rather similar to the lo result of single - resolved photoproduction both in shape and normalization [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : xs](a ) ] .    in order to complete the nlo treatment of prompt @xmath0 production in two - photon collisions",
    ", we still need to evaluate the nlo corrections to single- and double - resolved photoproduction .",
    "then , also prompt @xmath0 production in photoproduction at hera and hadroproduction at the tevatron can be described at nlo .",
    "this will provide a solid basis for an ultimate test of the nrqcd factorization framework .",
