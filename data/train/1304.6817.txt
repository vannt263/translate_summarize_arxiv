    "pendry observed in 2002 that rather than using the lc - resonance of conducting split ring resonators to achieve a negative permeability as an average quantity @xcite , one can design periodic structures displaying some mie resonance , e.g. by considering a cubic array of dielectric spheres of high - refractive index @xcite .",
    "these resonances give rise to the heavy - photon bands in photonic crystals which are responsible for a low frequency stop band corresponding to a range of frequencies wherein the effective permeability takes extreme values @xcite .",
    "so - called high - contrast homogenization @xcite predicts this effect which is associated with the lack of a lower bound for a frequency dependent effective parameter deduced from a spectral problem reminiscent of helmholtz resonators in mechanics .    in this paper , we would like to achieve such a magnetic activity without a high - contrast material",
    "the route we propose is based upon a homogenization approach for high - frequencies i.e. when the period of a multilayered structure approaches the wavelength of optical wave .",
    "the extension of classical homogenization theory @xcite to high frequencies is of pressing importance for physicists working in the emerging field of metamaterials , but applied mathematicians also show a keen interest in this topic @xcite , where the periodic structures at sub - wavelength scales ( @xmath1 to @xmath2 ) @xcite can clearly be regarded as almost homogeneous .    the tool of choice for our one - dimensional model is the transfer matrix method , which allows for analytical formulae as shown in section [ sec : math ] , a high - order homogenization ( hoh ) method is proposed wherein baker - campbell - hausdorff formula ( bch , an extension of sophus lie theorem ) was implemented ; we stress that ideas contained therein can be extended to two and three - dimensional periodic structures , at least for simple geometries , such as woodpile structures , of particular interest in photonics , see @xcite .",
    "importantly , we not only achieve magnetic activity in moderate contrast dielectric structures , but also unveil some artificial bianisotropy in section [ sec : hoh ] , where a multilayered stack with an alternation of two dielectric layers is considered .",

    "furthermore , a correction factor is investigated in section [ sec : corc ] to estimate the asymptotic error , which is proportional to @xmath4 with @xmath5 the approximation order .",
    "we then numerically check the effective parameters through the dispersion law and transmission curves between the multilayers and the effective medium in section [ sec : num ] : a good agreement in the low frequency band up to the first stop band verifies the equivalence of the two structures .",
