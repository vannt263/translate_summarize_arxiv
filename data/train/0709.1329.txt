    "the group iv semiconductor , si and to a lesser extend , ge have been indispensable for the electronics and photovoltaics industry .",
    "the recent research efforts have shown that their nanocrystals ( ncs ) bring new features which fortify their stands .",
    "for instance , ncs can turn these indirect band - gap bulk materials into light emitters  @xcite or offer increased efficiencies in solar cells .",
    "@xcite the latter has been demonstrated in a very recent experimental study  @xcite by significantly increasing the solar cell efficiency in colloidal si ncs due to carrier multiplication ( cm ) which enables multiple exciton generation in response to a single absorbed photon .",
    "@xcite similarly , the inverse process , auger recombination ( ar ) is also operational and it introduces a competing mechanism to cm which can potentially diminish the solar cell efficiency and in the case of light sources it degrades the performance by inflating the nonradiative carrier relaxation rate .",
    "@xcite    the utilization and full control of both cm and ar require a rigorous theoretical understanding .",
    "the pioneering series of theory publications on the ar in si ncs belong to a single group based on an atomistic tight binding approach .",
    "@xcite unfortunately , they only considered hydrogen passivated si ncs without addressing the shape effects .",
    "moreover , their results do not reveal a size - scaling for ar but rather a scattered behavior over a wide band of lifetimes in the range from few picoseconds to few nanoseconds as the nc diameter changes from 2 to 4  nm . in the past decade , no further theoretical assessment of ar in si ncs was put forward . in this context , the ge ncs have not received any attention although with their narrower effective band gap , they can benefit more from the low - energy part of the solar spectrum in conjunction with cm for increasing the efficiency .",
    "( color online ) ar in ncs : ( a )  excited electron , ( b )  excited hole ; the solid and dashed arrows refer to direct and exchange processes .",
    "biexciton type ar and its inverse process cm : ( c )  excited electron ( d )  excited hole.,width=226 ]    in this work we provide a theoretical account of ar and cm in si and ge ncs which reveals their size , shape and energy dependence",
    ". another important feature of this work , unlike commonly studied hydrogen - passivated ncs is that we consider ncs _ embedded _ in a wide band - gap matrix which is essential for the solid - state device realizations .",
    "similar to the classification of wang _ et al . _ in their theoretical work on coulombic excitations in cdse ncs ,  @xcite we consider different possibilities of ar as shown in fig .",
    "[ augerrec ] .",
    "we use the type of the exicted carrier as the discriminating label , hence we have the excited electron ( fig .  [ augerrec](a ) ) and the excited hole ( fig .  [ augerrec](b ) ) ar and their biexciton variants ( fig .  [ augerrec](c ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "all of these have corresponding cm processes taking place in the reverse direction but only the cm in fig .",
    "[ augerrec](c ) and ( d ) are studied as they can be optically induced .",

    "both ar and cm require an accurate electronic structure over a wide energy band extending up to at least 3 - 4  ev below ( above ) the highest occupied molecular orbital - homo ( lowest unoccupied molecular orbital - lumo ) . another constraint is to incorporate several thousands of core and host matrix atoms within a supercell ( see fig .",
    "[ shapenc ] ( a ) ) . to meet these requirements",
    "we have employed the linear combination of bulk bands basis within the empirical pseudopotential framework which can handle thousands - of - atom systems both with sufficient accuracy and efficiency over a large energy window .",
    "@xcite details regarding its performance and the implementation such as the wide band - gap host matrix can be found in ref .  .",
    "we should mention that califano _",
    "et al . _ have successfully employed a very similar theoretical approach in order to explain the hole relaxation in cdse ncs .",
    "@xcite    after solving the atomistic empirical pseudopotential hamiltonian for the energy levels and the wave functions , the ar and cm probability can be extracted using the fermi s golden rule , @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are respective initial and final configurations with the corresponding energies @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , and @xmath5 is the level broadening parameter which is taken as 10  mev",
    ". however sensitivity to this parameter is also considered in this work .",
    "the spin - conserving screened coulomb potential is given by @xmath6 .",
    "the subject of screened coulomb interaction in ncs is an active source of debate ; recent publications predict reduced screening  @xcite whereas , other theoretical investigations  @xcite have concluded that the inverse dielectric function is bulklike inside the nc .",
    "therefore , we follow  @xcite and use @xmath7 as the inverse dielectric function , where , the so - called mask function @xmath8 is set to 1 when @xmath9 inside of the nc and 0 when @xmath9 outside of the nc .    expressing the initial and final states of the ar shown in fig .",

    "[ augerres ] ) .",
    "the interface region especially affects the excited state wave functions and the final state density of states and it makes our model more realistic for both si and ge ncs . as an observation of practical importance",

    "nc case , our calculated value at 3  nm diameter agrees reasonably well with the experimental photoluminescense decay time of about 105  ps which was attributed to ar .",
    "@xcite in fig .",
    "[ augerres ] ( c ) and ( f ) , we also demonstrate the fact that a choice of @xmath34  mev does not introduce any marked deviation from the case of @xmath35  mev as used in this work for both si and ge ncs .",
    "this parameter test automatically checks the sensitivity to the final state energy window chosen as @xmath367@xmath5 .",
    ".[table1]ar lifetimes for different ellipsoidal shapes of si ncs with diameters of 1.63 and 2.16  nm . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     next , we demonstrate the effects of deviation from sphericity on si ncs .",
    "we consider both oblate ( fig .  [ shapenc](c ) ) and prolate ( fig .  [ shapenc](d ) ) ellipsoidal si ncs described by the ellipticity value of @xmath37=0.85 . for the comparison purposes , we preserve the same number of atoms used in spherical ncs of diameters 1.63 and 2.16  nm .",
    "the results listed in table  [ table1 ] indicate that the spherical nc has a lower auger rate than the aspherical shapes .",
    "this can be reconciled as follows : in the case of either prolate or oblate nc , the electronic structure is modified in such a way that the number of final states is increased , furthermore , a coalescence of the states around the homo and lumo occurs .",
    "a similar effect was also observed in the asphericity - induced enhancement of auger thermalization of holes in cdse ncs .",
    "@xcite however , we should note that the shape effects are not pronounced .    in their work on the cm in pbse ncs , allan and delerue",
    "have deduced that such coulombic interactions are primarily governed by the state - density function .",
    "@xcite even though we agree on the importance of the density of states , we would like to emphasize the significant role of the coulomb matrix elements .",
    "we illustrate our point by fig .",

    "[ augerrec ] ( c ) and ( d ) ) for different diameters of the si and ge ncs .",
    "therefore , we consider the impacting electron ( hole ) to have an energy of @xmath38 above ( below ) the conduction ( valence ) band edge i.e. , just at the threshold energy to initiate a cm event . as seen in fig .  [ si - ge - multip ] , ee and eh type cm lifetimes for si and ge ncs decrease from the few ns to few ps as the nc diameter decreases .",
    "however , for ee ( eh ) type cm , the small number of final states at the bottom of the cb ( top of the vb ) cause a nonmonotonic dependence of cm on size of the nc .",

    "the correct placement of excited electron and hole after optical excitation is critical . we assign the excited electron and hole to their final states by accounting for all interband transitions with the given energy difference as weighted by the dipole oscillator strength of each transition which is a direct measure of the probability of that particular event . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ]  ( a ) we observe that the electrons receive the lion s share of the total excess energy which is the desired case for the high efficiency utilization of cm in photovoltaic applications .",

    "the auger coefficients that we extracted can serve for the practical needs in the utilization of this process . for the efficiency enhancement via cm in si and ge ncs ,",
