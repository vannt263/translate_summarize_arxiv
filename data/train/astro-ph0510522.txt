    "the fermi acceleration process of charged particles bouncing back and forth across a shock wave is the main ingredient for the generation of high energy radiation in a variety of astrophysical environments .",
    "this observed radiation is generally synchrotron light emitted by the accelerated electrons ; in this case one may recover the spectral index @xmath7 of the accelerated population from the synchrotron index .",
    "for example , the afterglow emission of @xmath6ray bursts that is seen in x - ray through the infrared is generally interpreted as synchrotron emission of electrons accelerated at the ultra - relativistic external shock of lorentz factor @xmath8 . the inferred spectral index , @xmath9 ( waxman 1997 ; see also meszaros 2002 and piran 2004 for reviews ) , thus probes the nature of shock acceleration in the ultra - relativistic regime .",
    "similarly synchrotron emission of electrons accelerated in the mildly relativistic internal shocks ( @xmath10 in the comoving frame ) with index @xmath9 could explain the prompt @xmath11 emission ( see e.g. meszaros 2002 , piran 2004 and references therein ) .",
    "these observations thus provide anchor points for studies of fermi acceleration in the moderate to the ultra- relativistic regime .",
    "they have actually been regarded as a dramatic confirmation of the theory of shock acceleration in the relativistic regime , which has been claimed to predict a `` universal '' asymptotic spectral index @xmath12 in the ultra - relativistic regime @xmath13 .",
    "relativistic shock acceleration has been studied through a variety of methods , either analytical ( peacock 1981 , and more recently vietri 2002 , vietri 2003 , keshet & waxman 2005 , blasi & vietri 2005 ) , semi - analytical ( kirk & schneider 1987 ; gallant & achterberg 1999 ; kirk _ et al . _ 2000 ; achterberg _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) , or numerical ( ellison _ et al .",
    "_ 1990 , ostrowski 1991 , ballard & heavens 1992 , ostrowski 1993 , bednarz & ostrowski 1996 , 1998 , 1999 , ellison & double 2002 , 2004 , lemoine & pelletier 2003 , meli & quenby 2003a , b , bednarz 2004 , niemec & ostrowski 2004 , baring 2004 ) .",
    "not all of these studies find the universal value for @xmath7 , however , all the more so when anisotropic configurations such as oblique shocks are considered .",
    "one clear example is the demonstration that fermi acceleration in superluminal ( perpendicular ) shocks in the absence of cross - field diffusion becomes inefficient ( begelman & kirk 1990 ) ; in the relativistic regime , oblique shocks are superluminal unless the angle between the magnetic field and the shock normal @xmath14 .",
    "it is generally suspected that the inclusion of scattering would make fermi acceleration more efficient in the relativistic regime .",
    "the simulations of bednarz & ostrowski ( 1998 ) and baring ( 2004 ) have indeed confirmed that the spectral slope tends to increase with increasing shock obliquity and with decreasing turbulence level , whose rle is to permit cross - field line transport to the shock front .",
    "however , a limitation of these simulations is that the scattering is simulated in a phenomenological way by setting a ratio of the perpendicular to parallel diffusion lengths and drawing pitch angles at random at each time step .",
    "upstream , it has been demonstrated that an ultra - relativistic shock wave overtakes the particle before this latter has had time to scatter efficiently ( gallant & achterberg 1999 , achterberg _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) , so that the details of particle transport are probably not crucial .",
    "downstream , however , the particle has to turn back before re - crossing the shock , and the approximation of ad - hoc diffusion lengths may be too nave to accurately simulate the transport .",
    "in fact , one may expect non - trivial correlation functions between displacements along different directions as well as subdiffusion regimes to play a significant rle in the return to the shock .",
    "several studies have tried to integrate out exactly the particles trajectories in a well - defined magnetic field structure ( ballard & heavens 1992 , ostrowski 1993 , lemoine & pelletier 2003 , niemec & ostrowski 2004 ) .",
    "the study of ballard & heavens ( 1992 ) involved a realistic magnetic field structure , in the sense that it obeys the shock jump conditions , but was limited to mildly relativistic shocks ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "nevertheless , it observed a trend of increasing spectral index with increasing shock velocity , a result which has been disputed by the more exhaustive simulations of ostrowski ( 1993 ) .",
    "the recent work of niemec & ostrowski ( 2004 ) considered situations of moderate turbulence levels with varying degrees of obliquity for mildly relativistic shocks ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the conclusions obtained indicate that various spectral slopes can indeed be obtained , although the noise on the simulations is not negligible",
    ". finally , the work of lemoine & pelletier ( 2003 ) introduced a new numerical monte carlo method to study relativistic fermi acceleration , on which the present work is based .",
    "it assumed the downstream turbulence to be isotropic and confirmed the value @xmath17 predicted in that case .",
    "it seems fair to say that a clear picture of the efficiency of relativistic fermi acceleration in a magnetic structure that includes compression of the upstream magnetized configuration has not yet emerged .",
    "the present paper proposes to undertake such simulations in order to make progress along these lines .",
    "we assume that the upstream magnetic field is described by pure kolmogorov turbulence , i.e. there is not uniform component ; this can be seen as the limit @xmath18 of a highly turbulent plasma .",
    "the upstream magnetic field is compressed by the shock into an anisotropic downstream turbulence .",
    "we conduct our simulations in the mildly and ultra - relativistic regimes ; simulations of that kind in this latter regime have never been attempted before .    in section  2 , we describe in detail the numerical techniques and the procedure used ( borrowed from lemoine & pelletier 2003 ) to simulate the fermi acceleration process . in section  3 ,",
    "we present our results on the ( downstream ) return probability , the acceleration timescale and the accelerated spectrum as a function of shock lorentz factor . in section  4",
    "we discuss the relaxation length of the turbulence and argue that , for relativistic shocks at least , particles that return to the shock downstream do not travel beyond the point where the anisotropy of turbulence has relaxed .",
    "we also discuss the properties of transport of particles in the strongly anisotropic turbulence generated by shock compression , compare our results to previous studies and comment on the applications of our results to shock acceleration in @xmath6ray bursts and to shock acceleration of ultra - high energy cosmic rays .",
    "conclusions and a summary of the results are provided in section  5 .",
    "in the present work , we assume that the magnetic field is dynamically unimportant , _",
    "i.e. _ its energy density can be neglected with respect to that of the fluid .",
    "we also consider a strong shock , for which the upstream random kinetic energy per particle can be neglected with respect to that downstream .",
    "the corresponding hydrodynamic jump conditions are given in blandford & mckee ( 1977 ) , and reviewed in kirk & duffy ( 2001 ) and gallant ( 2002 ) .",
    "the shock lorentz factor is denoted @xmath19 in the upstream frame ( taken as the lab frame ) , and the shock velocity upstream is @xmath20 . unless otherwise noted , all quantities are calculated in this frame .",
    "if relevant the reference frame is indicated by a subscript , e.g. , @xmath21 refers to the shock velocity measured in the downstream rest frame and @xmath22 refers to the shock lorentz factor in the downstream frame .",
    "the relative lorentz factor between upstream and downstream is noted @xmath23 and reads : @xmath24 the downstream lorentz factor @xmath22 as well as @xmath23 can be obtained as a function of @xmath19 ( upstream shock lorentz factor ) using the relations derived from the shock jump conditions for a synge equation of state ( gallant 2002 ) : @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 being the downstream temperature and @xmath28 the particle mass , @xmath29 , with @xmath30 , @xmath31 modified bessel functions , and @xmath32 ^ 2 - \\xi^2 $ ] .",

    "the conservation of the electromagnetic field energy - momentum tensor implies the following jump conditions for the magnetic field components @xmath39 ( aligned with the shock normal ) and @xmath40 ( tangential to the shock surface ) :    @xmath41    and as before , @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "the parallel component @xmath39 is thus conserved while the perpendicular component @xmath40 is amplified by the proper shock compression ratio @xmath44 . in the ultra - relativistic limit @xmath45 , and the total magnetic field strength is amplified by @xmath46 .",
    "we assume that the upstream magnetic field is purely turbulent with a power spectrum describing kolmogorov turbulence with maximal length scale @xmath47 .",
    "it is modeled as a sum of static plane wave modes according to : @xmath48 with @xmath49 a unit polarization vector orthogonal to @xmath50 , @xmath51 a random phase and @xmath52 the amplitude of the power spectrum .",
    "the wavenumbers @xmath53 range from @xmath54 to some maximal wavenumber @xmath55 ; numerically we employ  250 wavenumbers modes whose directions are drawn at random , and whose moduli are spaced logarithmically between @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath58 can be chosen as real and is normalized such that : @xmath59 with @xmath60 the squared turbulent magnetic field strength .    according to the shock jump conditions ,",
    "the downstream magnetic field is described by an anisotropic turbulence : while @xmath39 is conserved , the turbulence wavenumbers @xmath61 are amplified by @xmath62 , which corresponds to the compression of the eddies by @xmath63 along the shock normal .",
    "the perpendicular wavenumbers @xmath64 are conserved through the shock but @xmath40 is amplified as before .",
    "hence the downstream magnetic field is described by : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is related to the wavenumber @xmath50 of eq .",
    "[ eq : bu ] by @xmath67 and @xmath68 ; similarly @xmath69 is related to @xmath70 by : @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "note that @xmath73 as required for a divergenceless field ; @xmath74 and @xmath75 are not modified .",
    "we chose not to normalize the above polarization vector to unity downstream and its modulus gives the overall amplification factor of the magnetic field .",
    "this is but a matter of convention : one may equally well embody the compression factor in @xmath58 and normalize @xmath76 to unity .      our numerical procedure is summarized in lemoine & pelletier ( 2003 ) . it consists in two main steps : in a first stage , we conduct monte carlo simulations of particle propagation in a magnetized medium ( either upstream or downstream ) and derive the statistical properties related to shock crossing and re - crossing , as described below . in a second step we use these statistical distributions in conjunction with the lorentz transforms from one frame to the other to reconstruct the accelerated spectrum that escapes downstream .",
    "once the magnetic field structure is set up as described above , one monte carlo simulation of the propagation of particle consists in integrating the equation of motion in the magnetic field .",
    "the particle trajectory is saved in time intervals that are a fraction @xmath77 ( upstream ) or @xmath78 ( downstream ) of larmor time @xmath79 ( with @xmath80 ) over a time period as long as @xmath81 ( upstream ) or @xmath82 ( downstream ) larmor time . for",
    "each computed trajectory one can build a statistical sample of shock crossing and re - crossing as follows .",
    "one draws at random a point along the trajectory , which defines the point at which the particle enters through the shock .",
    "one records the ingress pitch angle cosine of the particle momentum with respect to the shock normal at that point .",
    "one then searches for the point along the trajectory at which the particle exits through the shock and the corresponding egress pitch angle cosine is recorded . in the downstream medium",
    ", it happens that the particle never re - crosses the shock as the shock itself moves away with speed @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) . by iterating the above procedure , _",
    "i.e. _ drawing other points of entry in the trajectory , and building other trajectories , one can measure the probability laws that control in a direct manner the fermi process .    in particular",
    ", the ratio of the number of shock re - crossings to the total number of shock entries at a given ingress `` pitch '' angle ( defined here as the angle between the momentum and the direction of the shock normal ) cosine @xmath85 gives the return probability @xmath86 . in a similar way , the number of shock re - crossings through an egress pitch angle cosine @xmath87 for a given ingress cosine @xmath85 gives ( after proper normalization ) the conditional return probability @xmath88 .",
    "one can define and calculate these quantities both downstream , @xmath89 , and upstream , @xmath90 .",
    "note that the ingress and egress pitch angles are calculated in the rest frame of the fluid under consideration .",
    "the normalization of the conditional probability laws is such that their sum over the egress pitch angle cosine yields the return probability as a function of ingress pitch angle cosine : @xmath91    obviously the upstream return probability @xmath92 must be unity if one considers an infinite planar shock with an infinite lifetime .",
    "this provides a useful check on the numerical procedure ; in the present calculations , @xmath92 does not deviate from unity by more than @xmath93 .",
    "downstream it is mandatory to verify that one does not miss possible late returns by varying the trajectory integration time ; we estimate that the mean of @xmath94 over ingress pitch angle cosines is accurate to better than @xmath95 .",
    "finally these simulations give a direct measurement of the return timescale to the shock as a function of pitch angles .",
    "this measurement is particularly important to estimate the maximal acceleration energy in a variety of environments , as discussed in section  3.3 .",
    "once the upstream and downstream laws of return probability are known , the simulation of the acceleration process itself can be performed as follows .",
    "we denote by @xmath96 the distribution function of particles that enter the shock towards downstream with ingress pitch angle cosine @xmath97 , that have experienced @xmath98 shock crossings and that carry energy @xmath99 ( downstream frame ) .",
    "similarly we define the distribution function @xmath100 of upstream - going particles with ingress pitch angle cosine @xmath101 , having experienced @xmath102 shock crossings and carrying energy @xmath103 . if we denote by @xmath104 the injection population upstream , then after an even ( resp .",
    "odd ) number of shock crossings the particles are necessarily upstream ( resp .",
    "downstream ) .",
    "the injection ( isotropic ) distribution function @xmath105 is normalized to unity , as follows : @xmath106 the integral over @xmath107 and @xmath108 of the distribution functions @xmath109 and @xmath110 with @xmath111 is smaller than unity , due to escape of particles downstream at each cycle .",
    "now , particles that enter upstream after @xmath102 shock crossings with ingress cosine @xmath112 re - cross the shock with egress cosine @xmath113 and with conditional probability @xmath114 .",
    "the total number of particles with egress pitch angle @xmath113 and energy @xmath103 at the @xmath115 shock crossing is @xmath116 .",
    "we note that the upstream egress cosine @xmath113 is related to the corresponding downstream ingress cosine @xmath117 , by a lorentz transform , just as the energies measured in the upstream frame ( @xmath103 ) or downstream frame ( @xmath99 ) : @xmath118 with a similar relation between @xmath119 and @xmath120 when the particle crosses the shock from downstream to upstream .",
    "therefore , the conservation of particle number at shock crossing u@xmath121d implies the following relation between @xmath122 and @xmath123 :    @xmath124 { \\rm d}\\mu_{\\rm u}^{\\rm e}{\\rm d}\\epsilon_{\\rm u } , \\label{eq : mapud_f } \\end{split}\\ ] ]    and one obtains a similar system for shock crossing  d@xmath121u : + @xmath125 \\,{\\rm d}\\mu_{\\rm d}^{\\rm e}{\\rm d}\\tilde\\epsilon_{\\rm d } , \\label{eq : mapdu_f } \\end{split}\\ ] ] with : @xmath126 where the ``  @xmath127  '' symbol has been introduced to differentiate the values of @xmath97 and @xmath99 from one cycle ( @xmath128 shock crossings ) to the next ( @xmath98 shock crossings ) .",

    "a similar formal development of the acceleration process by repeated shock crossings has also been proposed independently by vietri ( 2002 ) : the flux of particles crossing the shock in the stationary regime , noted @xmath135 in vietri ( 2002 ) is related to the above as @xmath136 with @xmath137 a normalization constant ( see also lemoine & pelletier 2003 ) .",
    "the present technique has significant advantages when compared to standard monte carlo techniques which follow the particle trajectories on both sides of the shock through the whole acceleration process ; in particular , it offers a significant gain in signal to noise as will be obvious in section 3 .",
    "it has however one caveat that should be underlined and which resides in the fact that we compute the accelerated spectrum by merging separate pieces of information on transport properties upstream and downstream . in so doing",
    ", we neglect the possible correlations that may exist between the upstream magnetic configuration at the crossing point and that downstream , i.e. we neglect the possible correlations between upstream and downstream transport .",
    "the only method that can take this effect into account is the direct monte carlo integration of individual particle trajectories .",
    "it is therefore important to compare the results obtained with these two methods in order to assess the magnitude of this effect . in the case where scattering is isotropic downstream",
    ", it appears that various methods converge to the same value of the spectral index , and this includes various non - monte carlo methods which can not take the above effect into account ( see , e.g. , achterberg _ et al .",

    "this suggests that , at least in the isotropic limit , these correlations do not play a significant rle in the determination of the spectral index .",
    "the numerical technique described in the previous section allows to collect a significant amount of information on the acceleration process , in particular the conditional probabilities of return from downstream or upstream , the energy gain per cycle as well as the acceleration timescale . in order to better understand the results obtained for each of these quantities",
    ", it is necessary to emphasize the difference between the effective coherence length along the shock normal @xmath138 and that tangential to the shock front @xmath139 as measured downstream , see section  2 : @xmath140 , where @xmath47 is the coherence length of the upstream magnetic field , and @xmath62 the proper shock compression ratio , @xmath141 when @xmath2 .",

    ", the above definition of @xmath144 does not correspond to the effective rigidity @xmath145 that controls the scattering of particles with turbulence modes of wavevector parallel to the shock normal : a given rigidity @xmath146 corresponds in fact to larger and larger values of @xmath147 as @xmath19 increases .",
    "the relevance of this observation to the results will be adressed shortly .",

    "[ fig : pret_mu ] .",
    "this is not a trivial result in itself , as the nature of the turbulence downstream depends rather strongly on the shock lorentz factor .",
    "section  4.1 provides examples of downstream trajectories for two different values of @xmath19 , and indeed , the displacements along the shock normal differ widely . hence one might naturally expect that the return probability would carry some form of dependence on the shock lorentz factor @xmath19 . as we now argue , this is related to the fact that the scattering timescale in the direction along the shock normal , i.e. the time required for the particle to turn back , is a function of larmor time , as demonstrated in section  4.1 .",
    "there it is argued that the particles that return to the shock have done one reflection on the compressed turbulence in their first interaction ; indeed , particles get trapped in a layer of the compressed turbulence when @xmath156 and @xmath157 , hence they can not return to the shock unless they do so in the first interaction .",

    "note that for the moderately relativistic shock @xmath199 , the return timescale also contains a weak dependence on rigidity , @xmath200 approximately , which disappears at larger shock lorentz factors . here",
    "as well one can interpret the behavior of @xmath201 as the result of reflections of particles on the compressed turbulence : the first scattering takes place on a larmor timescale and flings the particles back to the shock with probability @xmath202 ; if the particle does not return to the shock after this first scattering , the probability of doing so at subsequent scatterings becomes negligible for two reasons : the shock moves away at high velocity @xmath203 , and the enhancement of the tangential components of the magnetic field prohibits efficient transport along the shock normal .    at high rigidities , the downstream return timescale increases ; the increase is all the more pronounced as the shock lorentz factor is high .",
    "this is related to the difference between @xmath147 and @xmath144 ; as @xmath19 increases , at a fixed value @xmath204 , the effective @xmath147 becomes larger than @xmath205 and the particles leave the range where resonant scattering with turbulence modes along the shock normal is possible .",
    "the scattering time thus increases , see section 4.1 , and so does the return timescale .    finally , the downstream return timescale can be written as @xmath206 , since the magnetic field strength is amplified by @xmath46 .",
    "hence the downstream return timescale measured in the upstream rest frame is slightly smaller than the upstream return timescale , and the total acceleration time : @xmath207 .",
    "interestingly , the acceleration timescale becomes a fraction of a larmor time at large shock lorentz factor , which may allow acceleration to an energy limited by confinement arguments , in particular @xmath208 , rather than by energy losses .",
    "the present study has hitherto assumed that the downstream turbulence is successfully described by the direct compression of the upstream turbulence through the shock jump conditions .",
    "however one must expect this anisotropic compressed turbulence downstream to relax on a timescale @xmath209 ( defined in the downstream rest frame ) , hence on a length scale @xmath210 downstream .",
    "particles will then experience this compressed turbulence during their journey downstream provided the average distance traveled from the shock front @xmath211 , or @xmath212 otherwise the particles reach the point where the turbulence anisotropy has relaxed and the previous considerations do not hold ; however , as we now argue , the above inequality is generally satisfied in relativistic shocks for which the magnetic field is dynamically unimportant .    as discussed in section 4.3 , the return timescale @xmath213 for @xmath2 and @xmath214 .",
    "there is a residual powerlaw dependence on both rigidity and shock lorentz factor but whose power indices are @xmath215 , see section 3.3 , which we can neglect for now .",
    "a simple but somewhat nave estimate for the ( scale dependent ) relaxation timescale is @xmath216 , where @xmath217 is the eddy wavenumber ( related to the eddy size @xmath218 ) , and @xmath219 is the alfvn velocity . since particles of larmor radius @xmath143 diffuse through resonant interactions with turbulent modes of wavenumber @xmath220 , the effective relaxation timescale to be considered is @xmath221 .",

    "the comparison of the typical displacement along and perpendicular to the shock normal indicates that the particles appear confined in a layer of turbulence that lies tangential to the shock plane , and for periods of time extending well beyond a larmor timescale .",

    "one may probably attribute this discrepancy to the modest dynamical range ( @xmath261 ) that was available at the time of the simulations of ballard & heavens ( 1992 ) .",
    "if the dynamic range is not large enough , the particle rigidity always lie close to the upper range of resonance and this results in steeper spectra due to increased escape probability .",
    "the subsequent study by ostrowski ( 1993 ) obtained much harder spectra than ballard & heavens ( 1992 ) where suitable comparison can be made .",
    "in particular , for large turbulence amplitude @xmath262 , and shock lorentz factors @xmath263 , ostrowski ( 1993 ) obtained @xmath264 , where the range of values bracket different values of the mean field inclination with respect to the shock normal .",
    "our results for @xmath7 indicate slightly larger values for @xmath7 , but the agreement is generally better than with ballard & heavens ( 1992 ) .",
    "kirk _ et al .",

    "they have attempted to address the effect of anisotropic scattering downstream using an analytical description of compressed turbulence and an analytical estimate of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "they concluded that anisotropy does not affect significantly @xmath7 , a result which is clearly at odds with the present study .",
    "the source of the discrepancy lies probably in the modeling of downstream diffusion by kirk _",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) : as should be obvious from figs .  [ fig : corr ] , particles propagating in strongly compressed turbulence downstream do not actually diffuse downstream but rather turn back by reflecting on a compressed magnetic layer .",
    "the most detailed study to date is that of niemiec & ostrowski ( 2004 ) , who have studied fermi acceleration in moderately relativistic shocks ( @xmath259 ) by monte carlo integration of the particle trajectory in a magnetic field with a large dynamic range . among the results obtained",
    ", the authors quote a generic non - power law behavior of the accelerated spectrum : the spectra generally appear harder close to the cut - off ( @xmath266 ) than well below the cut - off .",
    "niemiec & ostrowski ( 2004 ) conclude that this effect is probably related to the finite dynamic range : close to the cut - off , the propagation regime in compressed turbulence differs from that in the inertial range of resonance , and one indeed finds a different return probability or mean energy gain , both of which control the value of @xmath7 .",
    "our fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] reveals a smooth powerlaw behavior at energies well beyond the injection point ; this is expected on the grounds that the conditional return probability histograms used to model fermi acceleration is itself rigidity independent .",
    "we have demonstrated in the previous sections that , deep in the inertial range @xmath267 , this is a good approximation ; however , we have also observed that as @xmath144 tends to larger values , the return probability reveals a slight dependence on @xmath144 , and this would make @xmath7 evolve with @xmath144 , albeit for @xmath268 , had we included this dependence in our calculations .",
    "our results disagree markedly from those of niemiec & ostrowski ( 2004 ) with regards to the rigidity dependence of the return probability in the inertial range .",
    "these authors claim to observe a pronounced non - monotonic rigidity dependence , which is definitely absent from our simulations down to the percent level .",
    "we note that the noise level in the results of niemiec & ostrowski ( 2004 ) is not indicated in the figures , and might account for part of this apparent variability . on theoretical grounds",
    ", there is neither expectation nor justification for a rigidity dependence of @xmath161 on @xmath144 , as long as resonant interactions with the turbulence can occur and the shock lifetime is infinite .",
    "there is no clear explanation or interpretation of this observed rigidity dependence of the return probability in niemiec & ostrowski ( 2004 ) .",
    "furthermore their measured value of @xmath161 does not agree with ours : for @xmath269 and @xmath270 , they find @xmath271 , significantly lower than ours .",
    "this results in a steeper spectrum with @xmath272 , to be compared with our value @xmath273 ; one should note that niemiec & ostrowski ( 2004 ) warrant caution with respect to their analysis of @xmath274 , as it lies close to the limits of their simulation capabilities .",
    "we also note that the results of niemiec & ostrowski ( 2004 ) differ signicantly from those of ostrowski ( 1993 ) , although the method used is similar . for @xmath275 , @xmath270 and mean field inclination @xmath276 ,",
    "niemiec & ostrowski ( 2004 ) find @xmath277 while ostrowski ( 1993 ) obtains @xmath278 for the same values ( but @xmath279 ) .",

    "as well the source of the discrepancy remains unknown .",
    "overall , and where comparison can be made , our results lie halfway between those of ostrowski ( 1993 ) and those of niemiec & ostrowski ( 2004 ) .",
    "as stressed at the end of section  2 , the present method offers a significant gain in signal when compared to direct monte carlo methods but it can not take into account the possible correlations between upstream and downstream trajectories due to the correlations between upstream and downstream magnetic fields at the point of shock - crossing .",
    "this remark , when taken together with the above comparison to previous work , shows the need for more exhaustive studies of relativistic fermi acceleration with shock compressed turbulence , including mean magnetic fields of various strength and obliquity , and using both the present method and direct monte carlo methods .",
    "gamma@xmath288ray bursts , with their shock lorentz factor in excess of 100 are ideal candidates to test theories on particle acceleration in ultra - relativistic flows . in the standard fireball model ( see meszaros 2002 , piran 2004 for reviews ) , the prompt @xmath6emission is interpreted as the product of synchrotron emission of electrons accelerated in the internal shocks with lorentz factors @xmath289 in the comoving wind frame . the afterglow emission is interpreted as the synchrotron light of electrons accelerated in the ultra - relativistic shock wave with @xmath8 , that itself results from the interaction of the @xmath6ray ejecta with its environment .",
    "the spectral indices of the shock accelerated electrons derived in both cases are @xmath290 .",
    "this has been interpreted as a dramatic confirmation of our understanding of relativistic fermi acceleration since it agrees with the canonical value @xmath291 obtained for isotropic downstream scattering . however , as should be clear by now , this `` agreement '' rather reflects our poor understanding of the acceleration process : the inclusion of shock compressed turbulence , which should be seen as a refinement of the theory , leads to steeper spectra , see section  4 , with @xmath292 for @xmath293 , and @xmath185 for @xmath13 .    the difference is not as significant in the case of internal shocks than for afterglow observations . as a matter of fact , isotropic scattering downstream predicts a value @xmath294 for @xmath295 ( lemoine & pelletier 2003 ) , hence it could not account reasonably well for the dispersion observed in the spectral slopes of @xmath6ray prompt emission .",
    "however it is possible that the inclusion of a mean magnetic field component with varying inclinations and , possibly varying turbulence level , could reproduce this dispersion .",
    "moreover it is not yet established whether the @xmath11 radiation results from synchrotron emission of shock accelerated electrons ; other radiating processes ( e.g. piran 2004 and references therein ) or magnetic reconnection events in the flow ( e.g. lyutikov & blandford 2003 ) are likely possibilities .    concerning the discrepancy of the present spectral index with that inferred from afterglow observations , one must note that the present study is limited to the case of pure kolmogorov turbulence upstream , which idealizes the limit @xmath296 .",
    "however , judging by the comparison with niemiec & ostrowski ( 2004 ) , one does not expect the inclusion of a coherent component to help resolve this discrepancy , as these authors have observed a steepening of the accelerated spectrum with decreasing turbulence level @xmath297 . in the ultra - relativistic regime , this trend should be exacerbated , since as @xmath297 decreases , one approaches the perpendicular shock acceleration limit where fermi acceleration becomes inefficient ( begelman & kirk 1990 ) .",
    "our simulations should thus provide a conservative lower bound to @xmath7 for the case that includes a mean magnetic field .",
    "the discrepancy might be attributed to the nature of the turbulence , in particular to the assumption of kolmogorov turbulence .",
    "again , the work of niemiec & ostrowski ( 2004 ) suggests that the turbulence spectral index has an effect on @xmath7 , although there is not enough simulation data to pinpoint what the exact correlation is .",
    "these remarks indicate the need for more exhaustive studies that investigate various turbulence spectra .",
    "interestingly , this suggests that prompt and afterglow observations of @xmath6ray bursts might be giving us information on the properties of the turbulence behind the shock front ; the upstream turbulence does not play any rle in the ultra - relativistic limit as a result of the limited amount of time that a particle spends upstream before being overtaken by the shock front .",
    "the interpretation of @xmath6ray bursts afterglows as synchrotron emission by shock accelerated electrons requires that the magnetic field intensity at the shock front be significantly higher than the average interstellar value ( e.g. piran 2004 and references therein ) .",
    "the nature of downstream turbulence would then be directly related to the amplification process , which might manifests itself indirectly in the spectral slope .",
    "the proposal of magnetic field amplification by the two - stream weibel instability ( medvedev & loeb 1999 ) has recently triggered a lot of interest .",
    "this instability seems able of explaining the high value of @xmath298 required , although debate on the subject is not closed , see wiersma & achterberg ( 2004 ) . in any case , the weibel instability amplifies the magnetic field in the transverse plane to the shock normal and on very small spatial scales ( medvedev & loeb 1999 ) .",
    "if the magnetic field on scales larger than or equal to the larmor radius of a typical accelerated particle is thus not amplified by the instability , one should expect acceleration to proceed as presented here , and the discrepancy should remain .",
    "these considerations may suggest that the amplified magnetic field structure differs from that proposed by medvedev & loeb ( 1999 ) or that the amplification mechanism itself is different .",
    "in this regard , we note that recent numerical studies on the weibel instability suggests that powerlaw acceleration may occur independently of the fermi mechanism due to the presence of electromagnetic currents downstream ( hededal _ et al .",
    "it should also be noted that stochastic acceleration in the downstream turbulence , which has not been accounted for in the present study , could play a significant rle in reshaping the accelerated spectra , as suggested by virtanen & vainio ( 2005 ) .    on a different line of thought , one should point out that the value of the spectral index derived here turns out to be in very good agreement with that required to fit the ultra - high energy part of the cosmic ray spectrum at energies @xmath299ev , namely @xmath300 , when one assumes that the sources are distributed at cosmological distances and do not evolve too strongly with redshift relatively to the cosmic star formation rate ( berezinsky _ et al .",

    "we have conducted a study of fermi acceleration at relativistic and ultra - relativistic shock waves , considering the effect of the shock compression on the downstream magnetic turbulence .",
    "the numerical simulations are based on monte carlo methods of particle propagation in realistic magnetic fields described by sums of plane wave modes .",
    "the numerical technique differs from the standard monte carlo modeling of fermi acceleration in that it measures the relevant statistical laws of particle transport on either side of the shock , and uses these probability laws together with the lorentz transform from one frame to the other to reconstruct the acceleration process .",
    "the turbulence was assumed to be described by pure kolmogorov turbulence upstream , a situation which idealizes the limit @xmath301 .",
    "the main effect of the compression with respect to the case of isotropic scattering is to steepen the accelerated spectrum to a slope @xmath185 in the limit @xmath2 , as a result of a decreased return probability .",
    "this latter effect is induced by the compression , which amplifies the magnetic field in the transverse direction to the shock normal : particles that enter downstream are trapped on a larmor timescale in a compressed turbulence layer and can not recross the shock unless they turn back within a few larmor times .",
    "consequently , the acceleration timescale is dominated by the usptream residence time , and can be as short as @xmath302 ( upstream frame ) .",
    "we have also argued that the accelerated particles do not travel far enough downstream before returning to the shock to experience a turbulence that has relaxed to near isotropicity .",
    "the derived slope does not agree with that inferred from observations of @xmath6ray bursts afterglows , which indicate @xmath290 .",
    "this inferred value is generally accepted as a success of fermi acceleration in the relativistic regime whose predicted canonical value is @xmath303 . however",
    ", this result only holds for isotropic scattering downstream , whereas the inclusion of realistic shock jump conditions , as done here , makes downstream turbulence strongly anisotropic and the spectra markedly steeper .",

    "<S> this paper presents numerical simulations of test particle fermi acceleration at relativistic shocks of lorentz factor @xmath0 , using a realistic downstream magnetic structure obtained from the shock jump conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the upstream magnetic field is described as pure kolmogorov turbulence ; the corresponding downstream magnetic field lies predominantly in the plane tangential to the shock surface and the coherence length is smaller along the shock normal than in the tangential plane . </S>",
    "<S> acceleration is nonetheless efficient and leads to powerlaw spectra with index @xmath1 at large shock lorentz factor @xmath2 , markedly steeper than for isotropic scattering downstream . </S>",
    "<S> the acceleration timescale @xmath3 in the upstream rest frame becomes a fraction of larmor time @xmath4 in the ultra - relativistic limit , @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> astrophysical applications are discussed , in particular the acceleration in @xmath6ray bursts internal and external shocks .    </S>",
