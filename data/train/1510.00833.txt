    "these groups were introduced by baumslag and solitar in @xcite , who identified @xmath4 as the first example of a two - generator one - relator non - hopfian group and thus answered a question by b. h. neumann , see @xcite . later on , it was shown that @xmath2 is hopfian if and only if @xmath5 or @xmath6 or @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes the set of prime divisors of @xmath9 , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "after reviewing some fundamental properties of baumslag ",
    "solitar groups , we shall consider random walks on these groups .",
    "such a random walk is constructed as follows .",
    "first , we choose a probability measure @xmath10 on @xmath2 such that the support of @xmath10 generates @xmath2 as a semigroup .",
    "then , the random walk starts at the identity element and proceeds with independent @xmath10-distributed increments each of which is multiplied from the right to the current state .",
    "the poisson  furstenberg boundary was introduced by furstenberg in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is a probabilistic model for the long - time behaviour of the random walk , and simultaneously provides a way to represent all bounded harmonic functions on the state space . in the early 1990s ,",
    "kaimanovich considered random walks on @xmath11 . under the assumption of finite first moment",
    ", he identified their poisson  furstenberg boundary geometrically , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  5.1 ) .",
    "in particular , he showed that the latter is trivial if the random walk has no vertical drift .    for random walks on non - amenable groups",
    "the situation is different because their poisson  furstenberg boundary can never be trivial .",
    "this motivates the present paper , in which we study random walks on non - amenable baumslag ",
    "solitar groups and their poisson  furstenberg boundary .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : bsgroups ] , we discuss some algebraic and geometric properties of baumslag ",
    "solitar groups @xmath2 with @xmath12 .",
    "we explain how these groups can be understood through their natural projections to the bass  serre tree @xmath13 and the hyperbolic plane @xmath14 .",
    "afterwards , we recall the construction of the space of ends @xmath15 and the boundary @xmath16 . they shall later be used to associate a geometric boundary to @xmath2 . in sections",
    "[ sec : randomwalks ] and [ sec : pfboundary ] , we discuss random walks on countable groups and define the notion of poisson  furstenberg boundary .",
    "we outline a few classical results and state kaimanovich s strip criterion , which is an important tool to identify the poisson  furstenberg boundary geometrically . in section [ sec : identification ] , we consider random walks on @xmath2 with @xmath12 . in order to ensure that the natural projections of the random walk to @xmath14 and @xmath13 converge almost surely to random elements in @xmath16 and @xmath15 respectively , we need to make suitable assumptions on the moments . if the random walk has vertical drift , we need to assume finite first moment .",
    "otherwise , the situation is much more subtle , and we need to assume finite ( @xmath17)-th moment .",
    "the fact that the projections converge almost surely allows us to endow the cartesian product @xmath18 , or occasionally just its second component @xmath15 , with the borel @xmath19-algebra and a hitting measure .",
    "finally , kaimanovich s strip criterion shows that the resulting probability space is isomorphic to the poisson  furstenberg boundary .",
    "for the part of the paper up to lemma [ lem : zerodrifttree ] , we will assume that the two non - zero integers @xmath0 and @xmath1 satisfy @xmath12 .",
    "in lemma [ lem : zerodrifttree ] and in the subsequent results , we have to restrict ourselves to the non - amenable subcase @xmath20 .",

    "we would like to thank wolfgang woess .",

    "moreover , we are grateful to vadim kaimanovich , who made a couple of comments that led to a substantial improvement of the results .",
    "the structure of baumslag  solitar groups can be studied by means of hnn extensions .",
    "indeed , @xmath2 is precisely the hnn extension @xmath21 with isomorphism @xmath22 given by @xmath23 .",
    "this fact allows us to use the respective machinery , such as britton s lemma , see @xcite , which implies that a freely reduced non - empty word @xmath24 over the letters @xmath25 and @xmath26 and their formal inverses can only represent the identity element @xmath27 if it contains @xmath28 with @xmath29 or @xmath30 with @xmath31 as a subword .",
    "now , one can easily conclude that , if neither @xmath5 nor @xmath6 , the elements @xmath32 and @xmath33 generate a non - abelian free subgroup .",
    "so , @xmath2 is non - amenable . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath5 or @xmath6 , a simple calculation shows that the normal subgroup @xmath34 is abelian with quotient isomorphic to @xmath35 . in this case , @xmath2 is solvable and therefore amenable .    as we will discuss in section  [ sub : cratagi ] ,",

    "now , we can show as in lemmas [ lem : nonatomic ] and [ lem : support ] that the hitting measure @xmath674 is again non - atomic and has full support .",
    "moreover , we obtain the following version of the identification theorem .      1 .",
    "if the * vertical drift * is different from @xmath354 , i.e.  @xmath480 , then the poisson  furstenberg boundary is isomorphic to @xmath567 endowed with the boundary map @xmath496 .",
    "if there is * no vertical drift * , i.e.  @xmath253 , and the increment @xmath231 has not just finite first moment but also finite support , then the poisson  furstenberg boundary is again isomorphic to @xmath567 endowed with the boundary map @xmath496 .",
    "again , we apply the strip criterion . as in the original proof of the identification theorem",
    ", we take the @xmath10-boundary @xmath567 and the @xmath308-boundary @xmath570 .",
    "next , we define gauges @xmath675 we know that @xmath591-almost every pair of points @xmath592 has distinct ends @xmath576 , which we may connect by a unique doubly infinite reduced path @xmath580 .",
    "let @xmath593 be the full @xmath119-preimage of @xmath120 . to all remaining pairs",
    "we assign the whole of @xmath38 as a strip .",
    "this way , the map @xmath311 becomes measurable , @xmath38-equivariant , and satisfies the inequality of remark [ rem : removeg ] .",
    "now , pick an arbitrary pair @xmath592 with distinct ends @xmath576 .",
    "we claim that @xmath676 indeed , the inequality is easy to see .",
    "the strip @xmath593 intersects the gauge @xmath584 in at most @xmath585 many cosets of the form @xmath60 , and each of them contains at most @xmath585 many elements of the gauge .",
    "now , it suffices to consider the standard generating set @xmath238 and to observe that @xmath677 .",
    "then , using the fact that @xmath588 is a.s .",
    "bounded , we may conclude that @xmath678{~n\\to\\infty~}\\,0\\,,\\ ] ] which allows us to apply the strip criterion .",
