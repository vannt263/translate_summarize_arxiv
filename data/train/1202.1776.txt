    "the basic premise of the unification scheme is that all agns are fundamentally the same : accreting supermassive black holes .",
    "the central engine is surrounded by a dusty toroidal structure so that the observed diversity simply reflects different viewing angles of an axisymmetric geometry @xcite .",
    "the classification of agns into types 1 and 2 is based on the extent to which the nuclear region is visible ( figure [ fig : cartoons ] ) .",
    "directions with clear sight of the central engine and the broad - line region ( blr ) yield type  1 sources .",
    "those blocked by the torus result in type  2 objects , where the existence of the hidden blr is revealed only in polarized light . from basic considerations , @xcite concluded that the torus likely consists of a large number of individually very optically thick dusty clouds .",
    "indeed , vlti interferometry of the circinus agn provide strong evidence for a clumpy or filamentary dust structure @xcite .    in its most extreme form , dubbed the straw person model ( spm ) by @xcite",
    ", unification posits the viewing angle as the sole factor in determining agn classification ; that is , ( 1 ) the classification of any agn is determined uniquely by its viewing angle and ( 2 ) the torus is identical for all agns of the same luminosity .",
    "clumpiness invalidates the first assumption because it turns the difference between types 1 and 2 into the probability for direct view of the agn @xcite .",
    "since this probability is always finite , type 1 sources can be detected from what are typically considered type 2 orientations , even through the torus equatorial plane .",
    "conversely , if a cloud happens to obscure the agn from an observer , that object would be classified as type 2 irrespective of the viewing angle ( see figure [ fig : cartoons]c ) . in cases of such single cloud obscuration , on occasion",
    "the cloud may move out of the line of sight , creating a clear path to the nucleus and a transition to type 1 spectrum , as observed in a number of sources ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the second assumption underlying spm , about the torus sameness , obviously does not hold .",
    "all agns can not be expected to have the exact same torus ; there must be a spread in torus properties , even among agns with the same luminosity . here",
    "i discuss some immediate , fundamental implications of this inevitable spread .",
    "in panel ( a ) of figure [ fig : cartoons ] , observer 1 will see the agn as type 1 , observer 2 as type 2 . in panel",
    "( b ) the agn orientation is the same as in panel ( a ) , only its torus has a smaller covering factor . now both observers see a type 1 object even though their viewing angles have not changed . evidently , the torus covering factor  is as central to agn classification as is the viewing angle because an agn with a larger covering factor has a higher probability to be viewed as type 2 by a random observer .",
    "this is obvious also for the more realistic clumpy torus , shown in panel ( c ) of figure [ fig : cartoons ] .",
    "therefore , in a sample of agns with a distribution of covering factors , those with a larger  will have a higher probability to be viewed as type-2 by a random observer , implying that    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ agns are drawn * preferentially * from the distribution of covering factors ; type-1 are more likely drawn from the distribution lower end , type-2 from its higher end_. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    contrary to the widespread notion that agns of types 1 and 2 are intrinsically the same objects , fundamental differences between their average properties do exist .",
    "this is a more realistic formulation of the unification scheme than spm , with profound implications for agn studies .",
    "realistic unification immediately explains the findings by @xcite , based on sed modeling of agn ir emission , that the dusty tori tend to have larger covering factors in seyfert 2 than in seyfert 1 .",
    "it also explains the seemingly puzzling results of the recent study by @xcite , who analyzed in detail stacked hard x - ray spectra ( 50200 kev ) of all @xmath0 seyfert galaxies detected with , the hard x - ray / soft @xmath1-ray mission . in agreement with the basic tenets of unification",
    ", both seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 were found to have the same average nuclear continuum emission , with a photon index of @xmath2=1.8 .",
    "but in apparent contradiction with unification , the reflection component was significantly stronger for the average spectrum of compton thin seyfert 2 than for seyfert 1 .",
    "ricci et al find this discrepancy to arise from a further sub - division among the seyfert 2 agns .",
    "the  lightly obscured \" ones (  @xmath3 ) have the same reflection component as seyfert 1 , @xmath4 , but those that are  mildly obscured \" ( @xmath5 ) display a much stronger reflection with @xmath6 .",
    "while this finding contradicts simplistic forms of unification , it is precisely the behavior expected from its realistic formulation : seyfert 1 and lightly obscured seyfert 2 correspond to different viewing angles of intrinsically similar agns , drawn from the low end of the covering factor distribution , thus they conform , on average , to simplistic unification .",
    "but in mildly obscured seyfert 2 the absorber / reflector covers a larger fraction of the x - ray source , producing stronger reflection that is not seen in the average seyfert 1 spectrum , where large covering factors are rare .",
    "the large difference between the average reflection spectra of seyfert 1 and 2 arises from significant differences in their torus covering factors .     from the axis is @xmath7 , with @xmath8 and @xmath9 free parameters .",
    "each contour is the locus of @xmath8@xmath9 combinations that produce the labeled covering factor .",
    "the data points are from clumpy torus modeling of ir observations of agns reported in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "[ fig : contours ] ]",
    "the sometime loosely invoked concept of  torus covering factor \" , , can be rigorously defined as the fraction of the sky at the agn center covered by obscuring material ; it is the same as the fraction of randomly distributed observers whose view to the center is blocked , and thus see a type 2 agn @xcite .",
    "denote by @xmath10 the overall number of clouds encountered , on average , along angle @xmath11 from the axis .",
    "then the probability for direct viewing of the agn from that direction is @xmath12 and the torus covering factor is @xmath13 . if  is the average number of clouds along radial equatorial rays then @xmath14 , where @xmath15 .",
    "the cloud angular distribution function @xmath16 can be conveniently parametrized as gaussian , @xmath17 , with @xmath9 the distribution angular width @xcite .",
    "fitting of ir observations with clumpy torus models with gaussian angular distributions has been reported by a number of teams , and figure [ fig : contours ] shows the results of these modeling efforts in the @xmath9 plane together with the contour plots of . as expected from realistic unification , and first noted by @xcite , type 1 and type 2 agns preferentially occupy different regions in the plane .",
    "the few sources with a ",
    "wrong \" covering factor ( large-  type 1 , small-  type 2 ) merely reflect the probabilistic nature of clumpy obscuration .",
    "although this ad - hoc collection of agns , which were selected by different , unrelated criteria , does not constitute a complete sample ( only the @xcite analysis of pg quasars involved a complete sample ) , it does illustrate the point .",
    "since the covering factor measures the fraction of agn luminosity captured by the torus and converted to infrared , the agn ir luminosity is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is its bolometric luminosity .",
    "therefore _ type 2 agns have intrinsically higher ir luminosities than type 1_. contrary to earlier expectations of strong anisotropy at @xmath20 ,  observations at this wavelength regime show a great similarity between the ir fluxes of agns 1 and 2 when normalized with either their x - ray fluxes @xcite or optically thin radio emission @xcite .",
    "part of this puzzle was solved by clumpy torus calculations , which show much less anisotropy in ir emission than the earlier smooth - density models @xcite .",
    "realistic unification explains away the remainder .",
    "while infrared arises from reprocessing of the agn radiation captured by the torus , narrow line emission is generated by the radiation that has _ escaped _ the torus .",
    "the narrow line luminosity is proportional to @xmath21 . at the same bolometric luminosity , type",
    "1 agns can be expected to have a higher narrow line luminosity than type 2 .",
    "implicitly or explicitly , all studies of agn statistics assume that type 1 and type 2 are intrinsically the same objects , drawn randomly from the distribution of torus covering factors .",
    "realistic unification invalidates this assumption , implying that covering factors deduced from analysis of type 2 sources do not necessarily apply to type 1 and vice versa .",
    "this may contribute to discrepancies among studies of agn statistics .",
    "thus the fraction of compton thick agns ( x - ray obscuring column ) was determined to be as high as 50% in a pre - selected sample of seyfert 2 @xcite but only  20% in complete x - ray samples without spectroscopic pre - selection @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that the type 2 fraction among seyfert galaxies is 70% , while @xcite find it to be only 50% .",
    "this discrepancy can be attributed , at least in part , to different selection methods .",
    "both studies based their selections on what they considered reliable isotropic properties : schmitt et al used 60  ir emission , hao et al the narrow - line luminosity of [ o iii ] @xmath22 .",
    "however , as noted above , thanks to the larger covering factor of their torus , seyfert 2 convert a larger fraction of their luminosity to ir , therefore ir - selection is biased in their favor .",
    "the opposite afflicts the line selection criterion of hao et al , which introduces preference for smaller covering factors and type 1 agns .",
    "even though the emission itself might be isotropic , in both cases it involves reprocessing of different fractions of the intrinsic uv / optical continuum , and these fractions introduced opposite biases in the two studies .",
    "all previous findings involving unification statistics , including the synthesis of the cosmic x - ray background ( e.g. , @xcite ) , therefore need a critical reexamination and revision .",
    "one can not draw statistical inferences from agn populations without folding in the intrinsic distribution of torus covering factors , which is unknown .",
    "a reliable determination of this distribution function requires ir modeling of an unbiased , complete sample of agns .",
    "the only practical method to select agns with minimal classification bias is through hard x - ray surveys ; although such selection still misses the most heavily obscured ( @xmath23 ) compton thick agns @xcite , it is the least biased method of agn selection . from the catalogue of _ integral _ observations in the 2040 kev band , @xcite extracted a complete sample of 88 agns , including type classification . using 0.3195 kev data from _",
    "swift_bat observations and the _ xmm - newton _ archive , @xcite have compiled another complete sample that contains 199 type - classified agns .",
    "identifying  counterparts to agns in these samples and fitting their ir observations with clumpy torus models , as was done for the sources shown in figure [ fig : contours ] , is the only feasible approach to determining the intrinsic distribution function of torus covering factors .",
    "searching through the  archives shows that the malizia et al sample has 54 matches ( l. bassani and a. malizia , private communication ) ; a similar search for the _ swift_bat sample can be expected to add significantly to the number of blindly selected agns with counterparts . in a future publication",
    "we will report separately the results of clumpy torus modeling of the ir emission for each source in this expanded list to determine its torus covering factor from the fitted values of  and @xmath9 , and construct from the entire sample the probability distribution function of .",
    "introducing spm , @xcite suggested that `` the true situation may be in some sense half way between the spm and the hypothesis that orientation does nt affect classification at all , '' ascribing classification to a single property of the system  orientation .",
    "however , quite apart from the indeterminism introduced by clumpiness , agn classification involves a fundamental plane spanned by two independent axes  orientation and covering factor .",
    "simply put , the true situation is not somewhere between spm and no orientation effects ; it involves an additional , independent variable .",
    "because the covering factor is an intrinsic , observer - independent property , it makes what has always been a difficult problem even more difficult .",
    "agn selection by an isotropic emission indicator is insufficient for reliable statistics because most measured fluxes involve reprocessing of the intrinsic uv / optical radiation and the fraction captured for reprocessing may differ .",
    "the ir luminosity is @xmath18 while the narrow line luminosity is proportional to @xmath21 , introducing biases in favor of , respectively , types 2 and 1 .",
    "past studies of unification statistics can not be fully trusted before they are repeated taking into account the , as yet unknown , distribution of covering factors ."
