    "since the seminal papers by @xcite and @xcite , most studies of risk measures deal with the univariate case , where the gains or liabilities are expressed by a random variable .",
    "we refer to @xcite and @xcite for a thorough treatment of univariate risk measures and to @xcite for a recent survey of the dynamic univariate setting .",
    "multiasset portfolios in practice are often represented by their total monetary value in a fixed currency with the subsequent calculation of univariate risk measures that can be used to determine the overall capital requirements .",
    "the main emphasis is put on the dependency structure of the various components of the portfolio , see @xcite . numerical risk measures for a multivariate portfolio @xmath0 have been also studied in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the key idea is to consider the expected scalar product of @xmath1 with a random vector @xmath2 and take supremum over all random vectors that share the same distribution with @xmath0 and possibly over a family of random vectors @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite defined the scalar risk as the infimum of the payoff associated with a random vector that being added to the portfolio renders it acceptable .",
    "a vector - valued variant of the value - at - risk has been suggested in @xcite .",
    "however , in many natural applications it is necessary to assess the risk of a vector @xmath0 in @xmath3 whose components represent different currencies or gains from various business lines , where profits / losses from one line or currency can not be used directly to offset the position in a different one . even in the absence of transaction costs ,",
    "the exchange rates fluctuate and so may influence the overall risk assessment . also the regulatory requirements may be very different for different lines ( e.g. in case of several states within the same currency area ) , and moving assets may be subject to transaction costs , taxes or other restrictions . for such cases",
    ", it is important to determine the necessary reserves that should be allocated in each line ( currency or component ) of @xmath0 in order to make the overall position acceptable .",
    "the simplest solution would be to treat each component separately and allocate reserves accordingly , which is not in the interest of ( financial ) agents who might want to use profits from one line to compensate for eventual losses in other ones .",
    "thus , in addition of assessing the risk of the original vector @xmath0 , one can also evaluate the risk of any other portfolio that may be obtained from @xmath0 by allowed transactions . in view of this",
    ", it is natural to assume that the acceptability may be achieved by several ( and not directly comparable ) choices of capital requirements that form a set of possible values for the risk measure .",
    "this suggests the idea of working with _ set - valued _ risk measures .",
    "since the first work on multivariate risk measures @xcite , by now it is accepted that multiasset risk measures can be naturally considered as taking values in the space of sets , see @xcite .",
    "the risk measures of random vectors are mostly considered in relation to kabanov s transaction costs model , whose main ingredient is a cone @xmath4 of portfolios available at price zero at the chosen time horizon ( also called the _ exchange cone _ ) , while the central symmetric variant of @xmath4 is a solvency cone .",
    "if @xmath0 is the terminal gain , then each random vector with values in @xmath5 is possible to obtain by converting @xmath0 following the rules determined by @xmath4 . in other words , instead of measuring the risk of @xmath0 we consider the whole family of random vectors taking values in @xmath5 . in relation to this , note that families of random vectors representing attainable gains are often considered in the financial studies of transaction costs models , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the set - valued portfolios framework can be related to the classical setting by replacing a univariate random gain @xmath0 with half - line @xmath6 $ ] and measuring risks of all random variables dominated by @xmath0 .",
    "the monotonicity property of a chosen risk measure @xmath7 implies that all these risks build the set @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath7 is subadditive , then @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath10 if and only if @xmath11 contains the origin .",
    "while in the univariate case this construction leads to half - lines , in the multivariate situation it naturally gives rise to so - called upper convex sets , see @xcite .",
    "a portfolio is acceptable if its risk measure contains the origin and the value of the risk measure is the set of all @xmath12 such that the portfolio becomes acceptable if capital @xmath13 is added to it .",
    "note that in the setting of real - valued risk measures adapted in @xcite , the family of all @xmath12 that make @xmath14 acceptable is a half - space , which apparently only partially reflects the nature of cone - based transaction costs models .",
    "@xcite establish relation between families of real - valued risks and set - valued risks from @xcite .",
    "the setting of riesz spaces ( partially ordered linear spaces ) , in particular frchet lattices and orlicz spaces , has become already common in the theory of risk measures , see @xcite .",
    "however , these spaces are mostly used to describe the arguments of risk measures whose values belong to the ( extended ) real line . furthermore , the space of sets is no longer a riesz space  while the addition is well defined , the matching subtraction does not exist .",
    "the recent study of risk preferences @xcite also concentrates on the case of vector spaces for arguments of risk measures .",
    "the dual representation for risk measures of random vectors in case of a deterministic exchange cone is obtained in @xcite and for the random case in @xcite , see also @xcite who considers both deterministic and random exchange cones .",
    "however in case of a random exchange cone , it does not produce law - invariant risk measures  the risk measure in @xcite is defined as a function of a random vector @xmath0 representing the gain , while identically distributed gains might exhibit different properties in relation to the random exchange cone . although the dual representations from @xcite are general , they are rather difficult to use in order to calculate risks for given portfolios , since they are given as intersections of half - spaces determined by a rather rich family of random vectors from the dual space .",
    "recent advances in vector optimisation have led to a substantial progress in computation of set - valued risk measures , see @xcite .",
    "however , the dual approximation also does not explicitly yield the relevant trading ( or exchange ) strategy that determines transactions suitable to compensate for risks .",
    "the construction of set - valued risk measures from @xcite is based on the concept of the depth - trimmed region , and their values are easy to calculate numerically or analytically , but it only applies for deterministic exchange cones and often results in marginalised risks ( so that the risk measure is a translate of the solvency cone ) .    in order to come up with a law invariant risk measure and also cover the case of random exchange cones , we assume that the argument of a risk measure is a _ random closed set _ that consists of all attainable portfolios .",
    "this random set may be the sum @xmath5 of a random vector @xmath0 and the exchange cone @xmath4 ( which has been the most important example so far ) or may be defined otherwise . for instance , if only a linear space of portfolios @xmath15 is available for compensation , then the set of attainable portfolios is the intersection of @xmath5 with @xmath15 .",
    "in any such case we speak about a set - valued portfolio @xmath16 .",
    "this guiding idea makes it possible to work out the law - invariance property of risk measures and naturally arrive at set - valued risks .    in this paper",
    "we suggest a rather simple and intuitive way to measure risks for set - valued portfolios based on considering the family of all terminal gains that may be attained after some exchanges are performed . the crucial step is to consider all random vectors taking values in a random set @xmath16 ( _ selections _ of @xmath16 ) as possible gains and regard the random set acceptable if it possesses a selection with all acceptable components . in view of this",
    ", we do not only determine the necessary capital reserves , but also the way of converting the terminal value of the portfolio into an acceptable one .",
    "in particular , our construction applies to random exchange cones and in all cases yields law invariant risk measures . in case of exchange cones",
    ", we relate our construction to the dual representation from @xcite and @xcite . throughout the paper we concentrate on the coherent case and one - period setting , but occasionally comment on non - coherent generalisations .",
    "@xcite thoroughly analyse and compare various approaches , including one from this paper , in view of defining multiperiod set - valued risks , see also @xcite .",
    "[ ex : intro ] let @xmath17 represent terminal gains on two business lines expressed in two different currencies .",
    "assume that @xmath0 is bivariate normal with mean @xmath18 , variances @xmath19 and correlation @xmath20 .",
    "assume that the exchanges between currencies are free from transaction costs with the initial exchange rate @xmath21 ( number of units of the second currency to buy one unit of the first one ) , the terminal exchange rate @xmath22 is lognormal with mean @xmath23 and volatility @xmath24 , and @xmath22 is independent of @xmath0 . the set - valued portfolio @xmath16 is a half - plane with the boundary passing through @xmath0 and normal @xmath25 .",
    "assume that necessary capital reserves are determined using the expected shortfall @xmath26 at level @xmath27 , see @xcite .",
    "if compensation between business lines is not allowed , the necessary capital reserves at time zero are given by @xmath28 ( all numbers are given in the units of the first currency ) .",
    "if the terminal gains are transferred to one currency , then the needed reserves are given by @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively in case of transfers to the first and the second currency .",
    "these values correspond to evaluating the risks of selections of @xmath16 located at the points of intersection of the boundary of @xmath16 with coordinate axes .",
    "however , it is possible to choose a selection that further reduces the required capital requirements . after transferring to the second asset @xmath31 units of the first currency , we arrive at the selection of @xmath16 given by @xmath32 obtained by projecting the origin onto the boundary of @xmath16 . in this case",
    "the needed reserves are @xmath33 .",
    "the situation of random frictionless exchanges is also considered analytically in example  [ ex : half - random ] and numerically in example  [ ex : two - currencies ] .",
    "assume that now liquidity restrictions are imposed meaning that at most one unit of each currency may be obtained after conversion from the other .",
    "this framework corresponds to dealing with a non - conical set - valued portfolio @xmath34 .",
    "a reasonable strategy would be to use selection @xmath35 from in case @xmath36 and @xmath37 and otherwise choose the nearest point to @xmath35 from the extreme points of @xmath38 .",
    "the corresponding selection is given by @xmath39 and the needed reserves are @xmath40 , which is higher than those corresponding to the choice of @xmath35 in view of imposed liquidity restrictions .    before describing the structure of the paper , we would like to point out that our approach is _ constructive _ in the sense that instead of starting with an axiomatic definition of a set - valued risk measure we explicitly construct one based on selections of a random portfolio and univariate marginal risk measures .",
    "then we show that the constructed risk measure indeed satisfies the desired properties of set - valued risk measures , in particular , the coherency and the fatou properties instead of imposing them .",
    "we show how to approximate the values of the risk measure from below ( which is the aim of the market regulator ) and from above ( as the agent would aim to do ) .",
    "the suggested bounds provide a feasible alternative to exact calculations of risk .",
    "furthermore , the computational burden is passed to the agent who aims to increase the family of selections in order to obtain a tighter approximation from above and so reduce the capital requirements , quite differently to the dual constructions of @xcite and @xcite , where the market regulator faces the task of making the acceptance criterion more stringent by approximating from below the exact value of the risk measure .",
    "section  [ sec : acceptance - sets ] introduces the concept of set - valued portfolios and the definition of set - valued risk measures for set - valued portfolios adapted from @xcite , where the conical setting was considered .",
    "section  [ sec : select - risk - meas ] defines the _ selection risk measure _ , which relies on @xmath41 univariate risk measures applied to the components of selections for a set - valued portfolio .",
    "in particular , the coherency of the selection risk measure is established in theorem  [ thr : rhos ] . while throughout the paper we work with coherent risk measures defined on @xmath42 spaces with @xmath43 $ ] , the construction can be also based on convex non - coherent and non - convex univariate risk measures , so that it yields their non - coherent set - valued analogues , such as the value - at - risk .",

    "it is shown that , for the exchange cones setting , the lower bound corresponds to the dual representation of risk measures from @xcite and @xcite . for deterministic exchange cones",
    "the bounds become even simpler and in case of comonotonic portfolios the risk measure admits an easy expression .",
    "we briefly comment on scalarisation issues in section  [ sec : numer - risk - meas ] , i.e. explain relationships to univariate risk measures constructed for set - valued portfolios , which in case of a deterministic exchange cone are related to those considered in @xcite and @xcite .    section  [ sec : cont - dual - repr ] establishes the dual representation of the selection risk measures .",
    "while the idea is to handle set - valued portfolios through their support functions , the key difficulty consists in dealing with possibly unbounded values of the support functions . for this , we introduce the lipschitz space of random sets and specify the weak - star convergence in this space in order to come up with a general dual representation for set - valued risk measures with the fatou property .",
    "theorems  [ thr : fp - rhos ] ,  [ thr : fp ] , and  [ thr : fatou - det - k ] establish the fatou property of the selection risk measure and so yield the closedness of its values and the validity of the dual representation . in case of the deterministic exchange cone model and for random exchange cones with @xmath44",

    "<S> since risky positions in multivariate portfolios can be offset by various choices of capital requirements that depend on the exchange rules and related transaction costs , it is natural to assume that the risk measures of random vectors are set - valued . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is reasonable to include the exchange rules in the argument of the risk measure and so consider risk measures of set - valued portfolios . </S>",
    "<S> this situation includes the classical kabanov s transaction costs model , where the set - valued portfolio is given by the sum of a random vector and an exchange cone , but also a number of further cases of additional liquidity constraints .    </S>",
    "<S> we suggest a definition of the risk measure based on calling a set - valued portfolio acceptable if it possesses a selection with all individually acceptable marginals . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained selection risk measure is coherent ( or convex ) , law invariant and has values being upper convex closed sets . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the dual representation of the selection risk measure and suggest efficient ways of approximating it from below and from above . in case of kabanov s exchange cone model </S>",
    "<S> , it is shown how the selection risk measure relates to the set - valued risk measures considered by kulikov ( 2008 ) , hamel and heyde ( 2010 ) , and hamel , heyde and rudloff ( 2013 ) . </S>"
