    "the system can be continuously transformed from a gas of fermionic atoms , starting for example at point @xmath0 and moving along some path to a gas of bosonic diatomic molecules at point @xmath1 .",
    "the specific path taken depends on the rate at which the sweep is performed .    in this article , we study the two limiting cases of an adiabatic sweep or a sudden change in order to gain a qualitative understanding of recent experiments .",
    "these two limits correspond respectively to paths of constant entropy or constant energy in the phase diagram ; the final molecule fraction and condensate fraction depend strongly on which of these paths is taken .",
    "the interpretation of the recent experiments of regal _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and zwierlein _ et al . _",
    "@xcite requires specific consideration of the time dependence of the sweep .",
    "this is because the only temperature measurements reported are those taken before the onset of the sweep .",
    "these experiments appear to have been done in the adiabatic regime .",
    "consequently it is crucial to plot theoretical predictions versus the initial temperature or entropy in an _",
    "adiabatic _ phase diagram , rather than the more traditional one ( e.g. figure  [ fig_phasediag ] ) used in previous interpretations of these experiments  @xcite . our simple model for a trapped system yields an adiabatic phase diagram in qualitative agreement with experimental data in the bec limit , where a critical _ initial _ temperature of @xmath2 is found . here",
    "@xmath3 is the fermi temperature .",
    ", the system can be continuously transformed from a gas of fermionic atoms to a gas of bosonic molecules at some point @xmath1 by adjusting the resonant state energy . ]    before presenting our model and results , it is useful to place our work in the context of previous work done on this system .",
    "there are two main aspects of the problem we address that have been treated essentially as separate questions in the literature .",
    "the first question has to do with the formation of molecules as the resonance energy is varied in time @xcite and the second issue is the determination of the equilibrium phase diagram @xcite .",
    "a feshbach resonance occurs between two atoms when the energy @xmath4 of a closed - channel bound state coincides with the relative energy of the atoms @xcite .",
    "a diagram of a feshbach resonance is shown in figure  [ fig_feshbach]a .",
    "the difference in magnetic moments between the open and closed channels allows the resonance to be tuned by adjusting an external magnetic field @xmath1 . due to the exchange interaction between valence electrons of the colliding pair of atoms",
    ", a coupling exists between the two spin channels . due to this coupling",
    ", the pair of atoms spends a finite time in this closed channel bound state during the collision .",
    "this has a dramatic effect on the atomic interactions in the gas and provides a way for pairs of atoms to form a bound state , even in the absence of a third atom influencing the collision .",
    "most of the work on the formation of feshbach molecules is formulated to address highly nonequilibrium quantum dynamics that occur on a timescale much shorter than the time required for the system to relax to thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the starting point in such an approach is to first understand the process of molecule formation of an isolated pair of colliding atoms  @xcite .",
    "one can treat the system as a two - level system , where one level corresponds to a superposition of scattering states in the open channel and the second level is the bound state of the closed channel , as illustrated in figure  [ fig_feshbach]b .",
    "the resulting coupled equations of motion can then be used to obtain a landau - zener adiabaticity criterion for establishing how slowly the @xmath1-field must be ramped to achieve a full transfer to the bound state  @xcite .",
    "more advanced treatments including many body effects have so far focussed on a gas of bosonic atoms near zero temperature  @xcite . in these theories ,",
    "the system is typically far from thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "this treatment is justified , since most of the experiments on feshbach resonances in bose gases are forced to probe the system for a very short time due to inelastic collisions , which heat up the gas sample  @xcite .    in a fermi gas , however , the same type of inelastic processes are suppressed by several orders of magnitude @xcite , resulting in a very long lifetime of the gas sample @xcite .",
    "this permits experiments to be carried out over a time long enough for the system to relax to thermal and chemical equilibrium . in this case",
    ", a statistical description may be more appropriate than a microscopic description .",
    "the dynamics of molecule formation can then be treated using a kinetic theory approach with boltzmann - type equations that describe the collisional relaxation processes , which set the timescale for adiabaticity  @xcite .    in the thermodynamic approach ,",
    "a good starting point is to first map out the equilibrium phase diagram of a fermi gas with resonant interactions , a qualitative sketch of which is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the first calculations of the phase diagram for this type of system were done by eagles  @xcite , leggett  @xcite , and nozires and schmitt - rink  @xcite using a single channel model for a homogeneous fermi gas .",
    "this work was improved upon later by hausmann @xcite and chen _ et al .",
    "more recently , the phase diagram was calculated using a two - channel model for both homogeneous  @xcite and trapped gases  @xcite .",
    "one of the main goals of all of these calculations is to determine the transition temperature separating the superfluid and normal phases , denoted by the blue line in figure 1 .",
    "the important question of how the system traverses from one point in the phase diagram to another as the resonance energy is varied was not addressed in these calculations .    to address the question of molecule formation within equilibrium thermodynamics",
    ", one can consider the two limiting cases of a very slow sweep of @xmath4 or a sudden jump .",
    "if @xmath4 is varied at a rate much lower than the collisional relaxation rate , the system will remain in equilibrium and the process will be adiabatic  @xcite . in this case the entropy is conserved during the sweep .",
    "some aspects of this case were explored by kokkelmans et al . for a normal gas  @xcite and by carr _",
    "_ in the superfluid regime  @xcite . in the other limit of changing @xmath4 suddenly , on a timescale much shorter than the relaxation time , the entropy increases",

    ", the energy is conserved as the system relaxes to a new temperature .",
    "chin and grimm discussed this case at length , treating an ideal gas mixture of atoms and molecules in the classical regime @xmath5  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a detailed study of both cases of adiabatic and sudden variations in @xmath4 .",
    "our work extends the work of chin and grimm into the quantum degenerate regime .",

    "the primary goal of our work is to develop a conceptual understanding of molecule formation in the adiabatic and sudden limits within the framework of statistical mechanics . for this purpose",
    "the ideal gas is an excellent toy model .",

    "the region below the lowest line is a forbidden region of the phase diagram that can not be reached by suddenly raising @xmath4 . in the previous case of starting with all atoms",
    ", there is an energy barrier preventing a full transfer of all the atoms into molecules .",
    "here we find that all of the molecules can dissociate as @xmath4 is increased .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the thermodynamics of molecule formation in an ideal gas mixture of fermionic atoms and bosonic molecules that are in chemical and thermal equilibrium , where the internal energy of the molecules can be adjusted relative to that of the atoms .",
    "we considered both limiting cases of sweeping the resonance energy adiabatically or changing it suddenly .",
    "our work is the natural extension into the quantum degenerate regime of the earlier work by chin and grimm  @xcite who studied a classical gas and has some overlap with the recent work of carr _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "our toy model serves as a useful guide for studying the problem of molecule formation in the adiabatic and sudden limits .",
    "in particular , we have given a prescription for calculating the adiabatic phase diagrams , shown in figure  [ fig_distorted ] , in which the molecule fraction and fraction of condensed molecules are plotted versus the resonance position @xmath4 and entropy @xmath103 .",
    "these should be contrasted to the phase diagrams shown in figure  [ fig_phasediags ] , where quantities are plotted versus temperature @xmath7 rather than entropy . in the experiments of regal _",

    "@xcite and figure 5 of ref .",
    "@xcite are adiabatic phase diagrams , analogous to figure  [ fig_distorted]b ; they are not the more intuitive phase diagram shown in figure  [ fig_phasediags]b  @xcite .",
    "this distinction is important to realize when comparing theory to experiment .    as an example , the theory of a trapped gas previously developed by ohashi and griffin  @xcite predicted a bec transition temperature of @xmath156 .",
    "subsequent treatments of a homogeneous gas by falco and stoof  @xcite and diener and ho  @xcite obtained a transition temperature of @xmath157 .",

    "@xcite and zwierlein _ et al _",
    "@xcite because the only temperatures reported there are those of the fermi gas at the start of the magnetic field sweep .",
    "the construction of the adiabatic phase diagram that is appropriate to compare our model with experimental data shows that an atomic gas with initial temperature of @xmath158 is adiabatically converted to a molecular gas with a temperature of @xmath159 , which is equal to the critical temperature for a trapped ideal bose gas .    in order to make a detailed comparison with experiments , a more advanced many - body theory that properly treats the effect of the resonant interactions",
    "must be used in order to describe the crossover to bcs superfluidity in the positive detuning region  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in experimental data the resonance position is typically expressed in terms of the external magnetic field @xmath1 rather than the energy of the resonant state @xmath160 ; this must also be taken into account when comparing theory to experiment .",
