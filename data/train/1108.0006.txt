    "the manner in which granular materials respond to external loads belongs to a class of problems related to mechanical stability .",
    "questions surrounding mechanical stability of particulate media have broad economical , environmental , and societal applications . these include the common practical problem of a collapsing grain silo , numerous natural events such as avalanches and mud slides , along with other unexpected destructive occurrences like dam breakage .",
    "many such events are reported annually and readily convey the dramatic , and often catastrophic , effects that are primarily due to the failure of various granular systems .",
    "the general physical theme that connects such a disparate range of problems is that of determining the underlying stress state of the system . given information on the distribution of stresses within the system , can we predict whether such systems will remain mechanically stable , and what are the conditions that might promote or inhibit failure ?",
    "one possibility is to employ established theories such as continuum , linear , elasticity theory @xcite .",
    "although elasticity theory applies over a wide range of situations , deviations from classical elasticity theory show up on a regular basis as some of the assumptions that underpin the theory break down .",
    "these problems have largely been emphasized over the past 15 years or so in studies of packings of granular materials .",
    "the essential point to note is that granularity , or the discreteness of the particles that constitute the packing , play a vital role in the resulting stress characteristics of the system due to a lack of a separation of length scales .",
    "thus , it is becoming increasingly necessary to probe the relevant limits of classical elasticity theory and its range of valid application .",
    "for instance , classical elasticity is often assumed to remain valid not only at macroscopic scales to infer stress properties from displacement fields during loading events of the lithosphere @xcite , but also at the microscopic level of interrogation in studies of nanoscopic indentation in relation to physical metallurgy @xcite .",
    "a convenient method to test the range of validity of classical elasticity theory in granular systems that has been utilized over the past decade is the localized force perturbation technique .",
    "this procedure has the particular benefit that for an isotropic elastic material the stress profile in response to localized forcing - green function response - can be determined without the need for any free parameters .",
    "we review this result for the case of three dimensions - boussinesq equations - in the following section ( and see the appendix ) . to summarize efforts to date , studies on two- and three - dimensional granular packings indicate that disordered and frictional systems tend to follow the predictions of isotropic elasticity theory . whereas , ordered packings composed of frictionless particles result in strongly anisotropic stress profiles that are not consistent with a linear , isotropic , elastic model .",
    "such anisotropic profiles ( see below for a more qualitative definition ) have been debated in relation to anisotropic elasticity theory based on differential equations of the elliptic class @xcite , and alternative descriptions of the hyperbolic wave variety @xcite . to distinguish between the traditional isotropic result and anisotropic stress profiles we refer to these as _ one - peak _ and _ two - peak _ response profiles respectively , in reference to two dimensional experiments and simulations that have reported these observations @xcite .    in recent computer simulations",
    "the role of structure for frictionless granular packings on the stress response in a pseudo - infinite medium was investigated @xcite .",
    "these studies showed that for ordered and quasi - ordered arrangements of frictionless grains , the response function was two - peak but consistent with the framework of an anisotropic elastic theory .",
    "a phenomenological model was employed to fit these anisotropic profiles that necessarily captured the two - peak character of the response profiles . as the structural disorder of the packing",
    "was increased , the stress response crossed over to a one - peak response , more in line with isotropic behavior .    the problem addressed here is to determine how confinement affects the stress response of granular packings .",
    "in most previous studies samples were used of sufficient size that the perturbed packings could be considered as semi - infinite in extent . in some cases",
    "the roughness of the supporting base in packings prepared under gravity was seen to influence the magnitude of the stress response , although the response profiles retained isotropic , elastic character @xcite .",
    "we also highlight two particularly relevant efforts that have been proposed to describe stress response specific to two dimensional systems .",
    "extensions to three dimensions and especially for fully confined , shallow packings remains an ongoing effort .",
    "a non - linear elasticity formalism was developed @xcite that captures the main features of experimental results for two dimensional granular packings @xcite .",
    "the isotropic result is recovered through a multipole expansion of the normal stress response component @xmath0 of classical elasticity .",
    "this theory was also able to describe anisotropic profiles by including generalized nonlinear strain components through the introduction of phenomenologically defined elastic constants .",
    "a future extension of this particular formalism may be useful in describing the stress response for a wide range of granular systems in both two and three dimensions .",
    "additionally , force perturbation simulations of confined lennard - jones glasses @xcite found a range of stress response profiles that appear , at least superficially , similar to some of the isotropic results we present here .",
    "moreover , in some of the above examples a stress response crossover was reported either with system size and/or packing arrangement .",
    "this suggests that stress response investigations on granular packings can provide a route to understanding stress states in a range of systems where the discreteness of the constituent particles come into play .",
    "however , there currently remains a distinct lack of a systematic study on the role that system size plays in modifying the stress response in granular materials .",
    "we propose that such a study is needed with the ever - growing emphasis on the design of small devices where the particulate nature of the material eventually dominate the system properties .",
    "moreover , from this study we can estimate relevant length scales over which continuum elasticity theory remains valid , and below which alternative descriptions may be needed .",
    "thus , our goal here is to provide a qualitative guide map to the typical system parameters for which classical elasticity theory is likely to apply and those for which more advanced techniques may be needed to predict their properties .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the section [ sec : boussinesqequations ]",
    "we summarize the boussinesq equations of classical , isotropic , linear elasticity theory for an infinite half - plane , and discuss other possibilities that predict anisotropic stress response profiles .",
    "in section [ simulations ] we provide an overview of the computational technique and the packing preparation protocol implemented in this work . section [ results ] presents our main findings for the stress response behavior in frictional and frictionless particle packings .",
