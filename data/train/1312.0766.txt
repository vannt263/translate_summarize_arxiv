    "<S> [ fig : vap](d , e ) : the average overlap @xmath41 starts near zero ( as expected for a randomised initial condition ) and slowly increases , due to the influence of the template . </S>",
    "<S> further , for large times , there are a substantial number of trajectories where the system spontaneously evolves into a state with large @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the frozen template ( containing just @xmath42 of the particles ) influences the system strongly enough that it has a significant probability of returning to the metastable state associated with the original reference configuration . as before , @xmath43 as @xmath44 but this limit is not saturated . </S>",

    "<S> the results presented here indicate that inactive non - equilibrium states from the @xmath0-ensemble have strong amorphous order , of a range @xmath64 comparable with the system size @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this order is much stronger that that found in equilibrium systems at the same temperature , consistent with the stability of the inactive states . </S>",
    "<S> the evidence for the large length scale @xmath64 is indirect , but fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dom ] shows how bimodal overlap distributions can be attributed to the existence of large domains . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , these results show how dynamical ( non - equilibrium ) @xmath0-ensembles  @xcite can be combined with static concepts such as effective potentials  @xcite and amorphous order  @xcite , in order to understand stable glassy materials .    </S>",
