    "low mass stars evolve through the core h- and he - burning stages to finally enter into the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase of evolution @xcite . in this terminal phase",
    "most of the nuclear processing that is relevant for galactic chemical evolution is taking place .",
    "two shells on top of the electron - degenerate c / o core are burning h and he respectively . due to the different energy generation per mass unit",
    "the shells have different lagrangian speeds , and eventually shell burning becomes unstable .",
    "he - shell flashes occur that prompt a series of convective mixing episodes .",
    "first the region between the h- and the he - shell becomes convectively unstable because of the large energy generation in the thermonuclear runaway of the he - shell .",
    "then the layer at the bottom and below the convective envelope expands and cools , which makes this region unstable against convection .",
    "layers previously covered by the he - shell flash convection zone will become part of the convective envelope and processed material from the core ( or intershell to be more precise ) will be mixed to the surface .",
    "this process is called the third dredge - up .",
    "repeated dredge - up events will turn the initially o - rich giant into a c - star with @xmath5 .",
    "more than 20 years ago @xcite pointed out that observed and theoretically predicted parameters of c - stars disagree . on the one hand",
    ", models did predict c - star formation ( i.e.  efficient third dredge - up ) for large ( core-)masses , which implies large stellar luminosities .",
    "but no c - stars were observed at such high luminosities .",
    "instead , observations showed that c - stars have low luminosities .",
    "but stellar models of low mass were not able to reproduce the required efficiency of dredge - up , or any dredge - up at all . in subsequent years",
    "some progress has been made .",
    "the first disagreement has been resolved by the discovery that the envelope of massive agb stars is nuclear processed by cno cycling because the bottom of the envelope convection zone reaches into the h - shell @xcite .    for the second disagreement concerning the low - mass stars",
    "no final solution has been agreed upon .",
    "the most recent work by @xcite gives a detailed account of the dependence of dredge - up on mass and metallicity .",
    "however , they conclude that some scaling of their dredge - up law is still required as their models likely are not able to reproduce directly either the galactic or the lmc or smc c - star luminosity function .",
    "although much work has been published , no real consensus has been reached .",
    "the main focus has been on the numerical and physical treatment of convective boundaries @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite showed that even a small amount of exponential mixing beyond convective boundaries , including those of the he - shell flash convection zone , can greatly increase the model s dredge - up efficiency , maybe even to the extent that carbon star models of sufficiently low mass can be constructed .",
    "however , it is impossible at this time to know from first principles how large this convective overshooting really is , and all implications of this proposition have not yet been evaluated .",
    "understanding the dredge - up properties of agb stars is of great importance for current astrophysical research .",
    "yield predictions for low mass stars enter models for galactic chemical evolution .",
    "agb stars serve as diagnostics for extragalactic populations , and for this purpose the conditions of the o - rich to c - rich transitions are crucial to know .",
    "in fact , c - rich giants are the brightest infrared population in extra - galactic systems and new space - based infrared observatories like the spitzer space telescope emphasize the importance of improved stellar models in this regard .",
    "finally , the envelope enrichment of agb stars with the s - process elements is intimately related to the dredge - up properties of the models .",
    "we will in the next section describe the results of model calculations that show the sensitivity of dredge - up predictions to changes in published nuclear reaction rates , within their uncertainties ( sect.[sec : evol ] ) . in sect.[sec : nucrate ] we will present our assesment of recent work on the @xmath2 reaction rate .",
    "finally we will discuss the results for dredge - up modelling of agb stars ( sect.[sec : concl ] ) .",
    "we present here the first systematic study based on complete stellar evolution calculations of how changed nuclear reaction rates affect the dredge - up and envelope abundance evolution of agb stars .",
    "earlier studies have indicated that stronger he - shell flashes are followed by deeper dredge - up @xcite , and that a decreased energy generation in the h - shell leads to stronger he - shell flashes @xcite .",
    "a decrease in the @xmath2 reaction rate leads to a smaller energy generation , and thereby to a stronger he - shell flash and increased dredge - up .",
    "these earlier findings can be understood qualitatively in the following way .",
    "a less effective h - shell will cause a slower he - accretion onto the c / o core , and it will take somewhat longer to reach the he - buffer mass required to ignite the he - shell and initiate the he - shell flash . in that case",
    "the density will be higher in the he - shell , and thus the thermonuclear runaway will be larger because the shell is thinner and partial degeneracy is higher . during h - core burning",
    "the published uncertainties of the @xmath2 rate are usually not influential because the the thermodynamic conditions will adjust slightly to generate the energy rate required by the stellar mass . in the case of shell burning on degenerate cores",
    "this is different .",
    "the core is electron - degenerate and it largely determines the thermodynamic conditions in the h - shell .",
    "thus , a decrease in the nuclear reaction rate does lead to a smaller he - production rate , with the consequences of a stronger he - shell flash and more efficient dredge - up .",
    "two reactions are important in the he - shell burning . the triple-@xmath3 reaction with its large temperature exponent drives the thermonuclear runaway of the he - shell . the @xmath6 rate produces oxygen , mainly in the hotter and deeper layers of the he - shell .",
    "the rate uncertainties of both reactions have been considered .",
    "we have used the stellar evolution code evol , which is equipped with up - to - date input physics ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "we have calculated seven agb evolution tracks from a common starting model with a mass of @xmath0 and metallicity @xmath1 at the end of the core he - burning phase .",
    "mass loss is included according to the formula given by @xcite with a scaling factor @xmath7 .",
    "all calculations are evolved until all envelope mass is lost .",
    "we assume exponential , time- and depth - dependent overshooting at the bottom of the convective envelope ( @xmath8 ) . at the bottom of the he - shell flash convection zone",
    "no overshooting is allowed in this study .    for the benchmark sequence ( et2 ) we used the nacre @xcite recommended values for all three reactions .",
    "in addition , for each reaction one sequence has been calculated for the lower and for the upper limit from the nacre recommendation .",
    "we found that the uncertainty in the @xmath6 reaction has only marginal influence on the evolution and dredge - up , and we will not discuss this case any further here . a summary of the remaining five calculations is given in table[tab : sum ] .",
    "the factors listed are those that apply to the analytical reaction rate fits in the temperature range relevant for h - shell burning ( @xmath9 ) and he - shell burning ( @xmath10 ) respectively ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "the stellar evolution calculations show that the published reaction rate uncertainties for both the triple-@xmath3 and the @xmath2 reaction have substantial influence on the third - dredge - up , and consequently on the formation of carbon stars and the yields from low - mass agb stars , as exemplified by carbon . as shown in fig.[fig : n14-mc - lambda ] for the @xmath2 reaction dredge - up starts at a lower core mass and is larger for a given core mass if this rate is lower .",
    "it is interesting to note that dredge - up efficiency and derivative quantities ( like the yields ) depend in a highly non - linear way on the reaction rate . for both reactions the rate uncertainties are individually responsible for the carbon yield being uncertain by more than a factor of two ( table[tab : sum ] ) . the cases with the higher triple-@xmath3 rate and with the lower @xmath11 rate both lead to carbon star formation at a lower luminosity ( fig.[fig : l - co ] ) .",
    "in both these cases the stellar model spends five to six thermal pulse ( tp ) cycles in the c - rich stage , whereas the other sequences are only able to reach the c - star regime at about two tps before the end of the evolution when the envelope mass is already low .",
    "modeling of the third dredge - up and comparison with observations is plagued by a number of theoretical uncertainties , including the assumptions on mixing processes and mass loss .",
    "modifications like those proposed with respect to the c / o - ratio dependent molecular opacities @xcite are important in this regard too .",
    "it is evident from this differential study that the uncertainties in the two key nuclear reactions discussed here have a profound impact on the dredge - up modeling as well .",
    "nacre rates for the @xmath12 reaction reflect present values of the nuclear parameters and seem reliable for the present temperature range .",
    "the situation is different for @xmath13n(@xmath14)@xmath15o .",
    "the nacre tabulation for @xmath13n(@xmath14)@xmath15o is based primarily on fits to the data of @xcite . the resulting capture reaction to the ground state of @xmath15o contributed almost half of the total cross section at low energies .",
    "this led to a total s factor @xmath16 kevb and to the nacre reaction rates @xcite .",
    "however , there was a concern about this result @xcite because the fit to the ground state cross section yielded a surprisingly large value of the gamma width of a ( subthreshold ) @xmath17 state at @xmath18 mev in @xmath15o , about 7 times the value for the isospin - analog transition in @xmath15n .",
    "such large differences are rarely , if ever , seen @xcite . a more detailed reanalysis @xcite of the same data found that the ground state transition was small and that @xmath19 kevb .",
    "direct measurements of the 6.793 state s lifetime @xcite yielded much smaller gamma widths ; these results and determinations of asymptotic normalization coefficients ( anc ) for the relevant transitions using nuclear transfer reactions @xcite led to a similar conclusion and @xmath20 kevb .",
    "all these investigations show that the ground state transition is small and that the resulting total s factor is reduced by about a factor of two from the nacre result .",
    "recently , additional @xmath13n(@xmath14)@xmath15o data and corrected data from @xcite were analyzed to yield @xmath21 kevb @xcite .",
    "an independent measurement at tunl @xcite yielded @xmath22 kevb .",
    "because the most accurate results exist only in preprint form , and because of unresolved issues involving m1 contributions to the ground state transition @xcite , we have chosen to use an unweighted average of the four recent results and a conservative error to obtain @xmath23 kev b. this can be expressed as a factor to the analytical fit of the nacre rate in the relevant temperature range , for easy employment in the stellar evolution code , and this factor is @xmath24 .",
    "we have shown in sect.[sec : evol ] that the reaction rate uncertainties for the key rates @xmath11 and triple-@xmath3 have significant influence on the dredge - up and yield predictions of low - mass agb stars . within the recommended uncertainties ,",
    "both a @xmath25 larger triple-@xmath3 rate or a @xmath26 lower p - capture rate of @xmath27 than adopted by nacre give @xmath28  yield predictions that are higher by a factor of 2 ( table[tab : sum ] ) .",
    "preliminary tests indicate that the superposition of these two uncertainties is non - linear and leads only to a moderate further increase of the dredge - up and yields . clearly",
    "a detailed study of the superposition of nuclear reaction rate uncertainties is desirable .",
    "such studies are computationally expensive and time consuming , and are therfore postponed @xcite .",
    "the new @xmath2 rate resulting from recent work ( sect.[sec : nucrate ] ) , is even smaller than the nacre lower limit used in our calculation et8 .",
    "thus , the yields and dredge - up efficiency are likely to be somewhat larger in a model with the new recommendation compared to those from calculation et8 . in addition",
    ", the uncertainty in the triple-@xmath3 reaction has to be factored in as well , allowing a range of possible solutions that may extend to still more efficient dredge - up .",
    "preliminary analysis of our ongoing calculations suggests that a case with the nacre recommended upper limit of the triple-@xmath3 rate and the lower limit adopted in sect.[sec : nucrate ] for the @xmath2 rate produces about 3.2 times more carbon than sequence et2 ( both rates nacre recommended ) .    finally , as one of us",
    "has argued previously @xcite a small amount of overshooting at bottom of the he - shell flash convection zone can accomodate some convincing observational constraints related to h - deficient central stars of planetary nebulae , which are the progeny of the agb stars .",
    "this overshooting might further improve the agreement of models and observations .",
    "we have shown that nuclear reaction rates are an important physics input when modelling the third dredge - up .",
    "we have no indication that suggests that a dependence of dredge - up on these nuclear reaction rates is not a universal feature with respect to models of different mass and metallicity .",
