    "nanomagnets offer the ultimate thermodynamic limits of computation , as expressed by landauer s principle  @xcite .",
    "therefore , spintronics technology that uses electron spin for information processing and communication presents a favorable option to implement future low - power devices .",
    "most compelling proposals of spintronic devices rely on either the spin - transfer torque ( stt ) or the dipolar coupling effects between nanomagnets to accomplish switching of the logic device  @xcite .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper considers nanomagnet reversal through stt effect  @xcite .",
    "a major challenge for spintronics logic , in general , is the inherent stochasticity in nanomagnet dynamics resulting from ( i ) the presence of thermal noise and ( ii ) the existence of two basins of attraction that make the dynamic evolution of magnetization extremely sensitive to its initial state  @xcite .",
    "there is a two - fold complexity associated with spintronic circuit design due to the stochastic nanomagnet behavior as discussed in our prior work  @xcite .",
    "first , the circuit delay exhibits large variability that can increase the effective - delay of the circuit depending on the desired error tolerance .",
    "second , for interconnected logic networks , the delay distributions of individual nanomagnets combine non - linearly increasing the circuit delay complexity significantly  @xcite .    due to the complex nature of the equation governing the behavior of the nanomagnet body ,",
    "complete analytical descriptions for the delay distributions of a nanomagnet are unavailable .",
    "previous work has suggested that the effect of thermal noise may be approximated by knowing the initial angle of the nanomagnet and neglecting the thermal noise during reversal @xcite . while these models do provide significant insight into the nature of nanomagnet reversal , numerical simulations presented in this paper show that these analytical distributions are only accurate for rapid reversal times ( @xmath0 200 ps ) .",
    "therefore , for the case when the nanomagnet is under influence of spin currents comparable in magnitude to the critical spin current for reversal , new types of distribution functions to describe the magnetization dynamics must be sought . in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate the applicability of the frchet distribution that contains double exponentials to more accurately capture the evolution of magnetization over a very broad range of time scales .",
    "the frchet distribution is also compatible with the results obtained in  @xcite by analytically solving the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation with specific boundary conditions .",
    "once the nanomagnet delay is characterized using the frchet distribution function , we evaluate the circuit - level performance of series- and parallel - connected network of nanomagnets .",
    "we show that the delay variation is larger when nanomagnets are evaluated in parallel , while a series - connected network yields a much higher average circuit delay .",
    "the increase in average delay for series - connected nanomagnets is far greater than any increase in delay one may have to tolerate due to increased delay variation .",

    "for the remainder of this paper , the delay of a nanomagnet under the influence of a specific critical field will be represented by a frchet distribution that has been fitted to numerical data .      because the delay has been shown to be a random variable , the probability that the nanomagnet delay will exceed some time @xmath62 will always be nonzero . when designing circuits , this probability can be referred to as the nanomagnets error rate ( @xmath63 ) . using the frchet distribution ( [ eq : pdf_frechet ] )",

    "<S> it is shown that the delay - variation penalty incurred by nanomagnets arranged in parallel configuration is dwarfed by the average delay increase for nanomagnets arranged in a series configuration . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we demonstrate the impact of device - level performance variation on the circuit behavior using asl logic gates . </S>",
    "<S> while the analysis presented in this paper uses an asl - and gate as the prototype switching circuit in the spin domain , the physical concepts are generic and can be extended to any complex spin - based circuit . </S>"
