    "inflation is considered as the standard paradigm for providing an explanation for the observed spatial flatness , homogeneity and isotropy on large scales as well as for the observed perturbations on smaller scales  @xcite . from the point of view of particle physics , realizing inflation requires an extension of the standard model ( sm ) . in order to connect inflation to particle physics motivated extensions of the sm , for example to grand unified theories ( guts ) ( see e.g.  @xcite ) or to models towards solving the flavor puzzle @xcite , hybrid - type inflation models @xcite are particularly suitable . since in general high energies close to the gut scale are involved in models of this type , they are typically embedded in a supersymmetric ( susy ) framework .",
    "however , when trying to embed f - term hybrid inflation ( or inflation in general ) in local susy , i.e.  supergravity theories , a severe problem arises : a general sugra theory seems to almost inevitably generate a large mass for the inflaton of the order of the hubble scale @xmath2 which results in a slow - roll parameter @xmath3 , spoiling inflation .",
    "this problem is referred to as the @xmath0-problem of sugra inflation @xcite .",
    "several approaches to solve it have been discussed in the literature so far : for instance , since the fields involved in hybrid inflation typically have values well below the planck scale @xmath4 , one can expand the khler potential in powers of field values over @xmath4 and finally adjust ( tune ) the expansion parameters to protect the inflaton direction from obtaining large mass corrections ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "a different approach is to use a so - called heisenberg symmetry  @xcite , which involves the inflaton as well as a modulus field . here",
    ", the flatness of the inflaton potential is guaranteed by the symmetry .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite how this modulus field can be stabilized successfully during inflation in a novel class of models .",
    "the third approach towards solving the @xmath0-problem is to apply a nambu - goldstone - like shift symmetry  @xcite which can in principle protect the inflaton part of a complex scalar field against obtaining sugra mass corrections .",
    "however , it has turned out that in conventional ( `` standard '' ) models of susy hybrid inflation @xcite , the inflaton direction always develops a large tachyonic mass . to cure this instability , a coupling between the inflaton and the moduli sector has been considered , which however again leads to severe problems for realizing inflation as discussed in @xcite .    in this paper we propose a new model of sugra hybrid inflation where a nambu - goldstone - like shift symmetry is applied to guarantee the flatness of the inflaton potential .",
    "in contrast to the `` standard '' models of hybrid inflation in sugra , our model has the novel property of having @xmath5 during inflation . due to this property ,",
    "potentially dangerous couplings between the inflaton and the moduli sector are absent .",
    "in addition , the problem of having a large tachyonic mass at tree - level for the inflaton direction is also cured in our model .",
    "we point out that this model forms part of a larger class of models which have the same desirable property .",
    "furthermore , we note that in this class of models the right - handed sneutrino is a natural candidate for being the inflaton @xcite .    within the proposed class of models we address a second challenge to sugra models of hybrid inflation , namely the consistency between the predicted spectral index and the latest wmap results @xcite , which favor a value of @xmath1 for small tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , `` standard '' susy hybrid inflation models with flat inflaton potential at tree - level predict a spectral index above @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "since this is slightly outside the @xmath8-range given by wmap , it raises the question whether a lower spectral index can be realized . in this context",
    ", an expansion of the khler potential has been considered and it has been shown that a lowering of @xmath9 to @xmath1 can be achieved @xcite by a small term which , however , already introduces a curvature of the potential at tree - level .",
    "another possibility , pointed out in @xcite , is that a cosmic string component could allow for a more blue - tilted power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "other approaches suggest , e.g. ,  to involve field values well above the planck - scale  @xcite .    here",
    "we propose and analyze a new possibility to lower the spectral index @xmath9 in sugra hybrid inflation models based on a new term in the khler potential involving the waterfall field and the field which gives rise to the vacuum energy by its f - term . while the inflaton potential remains flat at tree - level",
    ", the new term changes the quantum loop corrections and therefore the form of the scalar potential .",
    "we show that without any tuning of parameters , the spectral index can be lowered and the wmap best - fit value for @xmath9 can be realized .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ the model ] , we describe the model given in terms of the superpotential and khler potential and the chiral superfield content .",
    "additionally , the shift symmetry in the inflaton sector is introduced .",
    "section  [ effective potential ] is dedicated to the investigation of the loop - corrected scalar potential and the tree - level mass spectrum to show that all other directions in field space are stable during inflation .",
    "section  [ predictions ] contains the calculation of observables obtained from the effective potential and finally , in section  [ summary and conclusions ] , we summarize and present our conclusions .",
    "to solve the @xmath0-problem in sugra hybrid inflation using a nambu - goldstone - like shift symmetry , we propose the following minimal setup described by the superpotential @xmath10 with @xmath11 being the superfield which contains the inflaton , and the khler potential @xmath12 the gauge singlet supermultiplet @xmath11 contains the slow - rolling inflaton condensate as the pseudoscalar component which will turn out to be a tree - level flat direction .",
    "@xmath13 is a static , so - called driving field which is fixed at zero during inflation and only contributes the large vacuum energy density during inflation by its f - term .",
    "@xmath14 is the waterfall field which also stays at zero during inflation , but gets destabilized when the inflaton reaches a critical value .",
    "both @xmath13 and @xmath14 are also gauge singlets in our minimal model .",
    "the form of the superpotential is motivated by the model of @xcite and the classes of models considered in @xcite , where the right - handed sneutrino has been identified as the inflaton field .",
    "it has the desirable property of having vanishing superpotential @xmath15 both during and after inflation , and all the derivatives vanish , except for the one @xmath16 , as we will discuss below .",
    "as an aside , we would like to note at this point that in `` conventional '' sugra models of hybrid inflation the superpotential consists of only the first term @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ tribridsuperpotential ] ) and the superfield @xmath13 contains the inflaton . the khler potential for @xmath13 is chosen to be minimal , i.e.  @xmath18 .",
    "large sugra contributions to the inflaton mass get cancelled by this special choice of @xmath19 , however not protected by a fundamental symmetry . to use a shift symmetric khler potential in combination with the above superpotential to protect the flatness of the inflaton direction ,",
    "the scalar potential would always contain a tachyonic direction for one of the components of the complex inflaton field .",
    "one possibility to stabilize it could be the introduction of a coupling to another sector ( i.e. to a modulus field ) .",
    "however , as has been argued in @xcite , such a coupling is very problematic for successfully realizing inflation . on the contrary ,",
    "the model we propose is free of these problems .    turning to the khler potential , it is symmetric under the `` shift '' of @xmath11 by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is an arbitrary dimensionful parameter .",
    "shift symmetry invariance of the khler potential requires it to be a function @xmath22 . for generality , and since all field values are well below the planck scale , we use an expansion in the absolute values squared of the fields @xmath14 and @xmath13 and in even powers of @xmath23 , where higher order operators are suppressed by suitable powers of some scale @xmath24 .",
    "the scale @xmath24 can also be viewed as the generation scale of the effective operators , and can well be below the planck scale @xmath25 .",
    "the fact that the shift symmetry of the khler potential provides a solution to the @xmath0-problem in sugra inflation can be seen by looking at the full ( f - term ) scalar potential given by to unity . ]",
    "@xmath26\\,,\\ ] ] where the definition @xmath27 has been used .",
    "the indices @xmath28 denote different scalar fields and the lower indices on the superpotential or khler potential denote the derivatives with respect to the scalar component of the chiral superfield or their conjugate where a bar is involved .",
    "the inverse khler metric is defined as @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath0-problem is the tendency that in sugra an inflaton mass of the order of the hubble scale is typically generated , which spoils inflation . because of the shift symmetry the exponential sugra contribution in eq .",
    "is independent of the imaginary part of the @xmath11 field , identified as the inflaton direction .",
    "this solves the usual @xmath0-problem in sugra inflation . in conventional hybrid inflation models",
    "@xmath30 during inflation and this can also induce a large tachyonic mass for the inflaton field at tree - level from the @xmath31 term in eq .  .",
    "this problem is automatically avoided in our setup due to the special property of having @xmath15 during inflation .",
    "furthermore , this property also eliminates certain couplings between the moduli sector and the inflaton which have turned out to be problematic for successfully realizing inflation @xcite .",
    "the khler metric is given by the second derivatives w.r.t .",
    "the fields and their conjugates . in the limit @xmath32 , it diagonalizes and in @xmath33-basis is given by @xmath34 with @xmath35 , we recover canonically normalized kinetic terms for @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the shift symmetry , together with the form of the superpotential , protects the imaginary part of @xmath11 from obtaining any mass term at tree - level .",
    "finally , the shift symmetry is slightly broken by the effective operator @xmath39 of the superpotential in eq .",
    "( [ tribridsuperpotential ] ) .",
    "while the inflaton potential is still flat at tree - level , this term gives rise to a slope of the inflaton potential at loop - level , as will be discussed in section  [ effective potential ] .",
    "we note that the minimal superpotential of eq .",
    "( 1 ) may be justified by introducing additional symmetries and spurion fields , as outlined in the appendix .",
    "we would also like to note that the above example model can be generalized to a whole class of models , along the line of @xcite , by allowing for variants of the form of the superpotential .",
    "furthermore , a specific ( shift symmetric ) khler potential may be chosen instead of the expansion we have used here for generality .",
    "the main point we would like to emphasize is that in our class of models with @xmath40 ( but @xmath41 ) during inflation , a shift symmetry naturally solves the @xmath0-problem , and that in the same class of models several problems of earlier approaches , related to tachyons or to dangerous couplings to moduli fields , are automatically avoided .",
    "the full f - term scalar potential is given by eq .  .",
    "in the following , we will assume that the fields @xmath42 and @xmath43 have already settled to their minima at @xmath44 .",
    "this is justified because , as we will show below , the fields can easily have masses larger than the hubble scale @xmath2 . from eq .",
    "we see that , in the minimum , we have @xmath45 such that all fields are already canonically normalized .",
    "the vacuum energy density is then given by the ( f - term ) tree - level potential which reads @xmath46 and is flat in @xmath47-direction .",
    "using the supercosmology code  @xcite , the scalar and pseudoscalar mass matrices are calculated to be diagonal and the mass spectrum is given by @xmath48 the directions in field space different from the inflaton are stable provided that their masses are larger than the hubble scale .",
    "this requirement leads to the constraints @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "for the fermions , we calculate the sugra mass matrix from @xmath51 this is also diagonal in the minimum and has only one non - vanishing eigenvalue during inflation . the fermion mass matrix squared in @xmath33-basis",
    "is obtained to be @xmath52    since for both the scalars and pseudoscalars , as well as for the fermions , only the waterfall sector @xmath14-components contribute @xmath47-dependent masses , we only consider their contributions to the one - loop potential .",

    "<S> we also discuss under which conditions the predicted spectral index can be in agreement with the best - fit - value of the latest wmap observation @xmath1 , corresponding to a hilltop - type inflaton potential at loop - level . </S>"
