    "the complication of the problem is hidden in the unknown time - dependent exchange and correlation ( xc ) potential .",

    "<S> it is shown that the charge velocity is larger than the spin velocity for the system of on - site repulsive interaction ( luttinger liquid ) , and vise versa for the system of on - site attractive interaction ( luther - emery liquid ) . </S>",
