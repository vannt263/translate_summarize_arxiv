    "dipole emission and the casimir effects in dielectric media are long - standing research topics in quantum electrodynamics .",
    "they constitute paradigmatic phenomena of the interaction matter - radiation related to the quantum nature of the vacuum .",
    "regarding dipole emission , it is known since the work of purcell @xcite that the spontaneous emission rate of an atom , @xmath0 , in a dielectric host medium depends on the interaction of the emitter with the material environment .",
    "this is so because the back - reaction of the medium on the atom via the self - polarization field modifies its self - energy . in the first place",
    "the host medium modifies the density of channels into which the atom can radiate i.e . the local density of states ( ldos) and hence the value of @xmath0 .",
    "second , the integration of the associated self - energy gives rise to a shift in the resonant frequency of the atom .",
    "third , the dipole - transition - amplitude gets also modified . as a result ,",
    "the medium is said to renormalize the polarizability of the emitter .",
    "+ in addition and complementarily , the medium polarizes the em vacuum since material degrees of freedom couple to the em fluctuations . as a result ,",
    "polarization fluctuations arise . in particular , this reflects in a renormalization of the susceptibility of the medium , which in turn determines the vacuum energy .",
    "+ we will postulate two distinguishable em vacua attending to the existence of two different spectra of fluctuations .",
    "these are , a _ light vacuum _ in which the light from an external source propagates through the medium ; and an _ emission vacuum _ in which the radiation emitted from a dipole within the medium lives . when the dipole constituents of the medium are equivalent to each other , the spectra of fluctuations in both vacua are related by an exact mathematical expression .",
    "it will be shown that the spectrum of the light vacuum is only part of the spectrum of the emission vacuum .",
    "+ in accordance to the above distinction , pairs of homologous quantities ascribe to each vacuum . these are , the light propagation spectrum and the dipole emission spectrum ; the bulk - dyson field and the dipole field ; the schwinger - bulk energy and the total vacuum energy .",
    "the relationships between the members of each pair are determined by local field factors .",
    "the finding of analytical expressions for these relations is the main achievement of the present work .",
    "+ we will deal with a dielectric medium made of isotropic point dipoles .",
    "the distribution of dipoles is statistically homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "ours is a classical green s function based approach .",
    "the system is linear , being characterized by a transference matrix @xmath1 .",
    "the coupling matter - radiation is weak so that in any multiple - scattering process photons are asymptotically free in between any two scattering events .",
    "therefore , the propagator of the radiation in the medium can be computed in terms of a stochastic lippmann - schwinger equation over the ensemble of scatterer configurations .",
    "our approach is compatible with the existence of internal resonances in single scatterers and geometrical resonances in clusters .",
    "however , excitons proper of high order systems in the strong coupling regime @xcite are disregarded .",
    "+ the medium under consideration is stationary with respect to ( _ w.r.t . _ ) the emission processes .",
    "all the quantities computed are time - independent ensemble - averaged quantities .",
    "no other mechanism but radiation is considered in the processes of gain and loss of energy by the dipoles . in particular",
    ", collisional effects and the doppler shift are disregarded . for the latter , the condition @xmath2 is required , @xmath3 being the typical velocity of the scatterers and @xmath4 the frequency of interest .",
    "there is also the weak - coupling condition @xmath5 . finally , in order to treat the scatterers as point dipoles we demand that @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath8 being the typical radius of a dipole and @xmath9 being the minimum distance between them .",
    "+ our approach is based on the microscopical diagrammatic treatments carried out by foldy @xcite , lax @xcite , frisch @xcite , dzyaloshinskii , gorkov , abrikosov and lifshitz @xcite , bullough and hynne @xcite .",
    "we base on milonni s work @xcite to apply our classical green s function formalism to the computation of quantum quantities .",
    "+ the article is organized as follows . in section [ la2 ]",
    "we derive the fundamental relation between the dyson propagator and the polarization propagator .",
    "the self - polarization propagator determines the radiative corrections which renormalize the single - particle polarizability .",
    "this issue is addressed in section [ polarizability ] together with the derivation of an expression for the optical theorem in complex media . that expression yields the total dipole emission , which is decomposed into coherent and extinguished components in section [ class ] . in section [ vacuum ]",
    "the light vacuum and the emission vacuum are related via symmetry transformations .",
    "the role of the local field factors in coherent emission and field renormalization is explained . in section [ casimir ]",
    "we calculate the vacuum energy of a generic complex medium using the schwinger variational method and particularize to the case of an effective medium . in section [ disc ]",
    "we comment on the difference between ldoses and discuss some misconceptions present in previous works . in section [ t ] we offer an alternative derivation of the fundamental relation between dyson s and the polarization propagators based on the coupled - dipole - method . the most relevant results are summarized in the conclusions .",
    "+ regarding notation , we will label three - spatial - component vectors with arrows and three - by - three tensors with overlines .",
    "we will denote the fourier - transform of functionals with @xmath10-dependent arguments instead of the @xmath11-dependent arguments of their position - space representation .",
    "in application of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , the ldos at a point @xmath12 for photons of frequency @xmath4 and any polarization is given by the imaginary part of the trace ( tr ) of the @xmath4-mode of the propagator for virtual photons created and annihilated at @xmath12 @xcite , @xmath13 when dipoles are present in the medium , in addition to the in - free - space em fluctuations , polarization fluctuations arise as a result of the interaction matter - radiation .",
    "consequently , the em vacuum gets polarized and the dielectric matter acquires additional self - energy .",
    "the field whose fluctuations in vacuum are named em vacuum fluctuations is the _ self - polarization field _ , also called _ radiation reaction field _",
    "@xcite . + amongst the polarization fluctuations , polaritons are excitations which satisfy certain dispersion relations and propagate coherently @xcite .",
    "that is , they are normal modes and they determine the spectrum of coherent dipole emission",
    ". we will show in section [ class ] that coherent emission consists of two components .",
    "those are , a _ direct _ component which is transferred radiatively and directly from an emitter into the medium . and an _ indirect _ component which corresponds to the coherent emission radiated by the induced dipoles surrounding the emitter .",
    "+ we will denote the total ldos accessible to the photons of frequency @xmath4 emitted from a dipole at @xmath12 by @xmath14 .",
    "we will show that the aforementioned _ direct _ coherent emission has the same spectrum as the radiation which propagates through the medium from an external ( uncorrelated ) source .",
    "thus , we will denote by @xmath15 that part of @xmath14 accessible to monochromatic external light of frequency @xmath4 .",

    "it was mentioned in subsection [ fp ] that the mg model neglects recurrent scattering . however , at resonance scatterers overlap optically and recurrent scattering becomes dominant .",
    "therefore , deviations from the mg results are expected @xcite",

    "_ the result of eq.([lffg ] ) but for the @xmath278-dependent prefactors .",
    "firstly , let us comment on the distinction between @xmath273 and @xmath284 for an effective medium .",
    "although both spectra are computed out of @xmath285 and thus ascribed to the light vacuum , their respective dependence on the refractive index and their physical meaning are quite different .",
    "we read from eq.([sch ] ) that @xmath286 originates from the integration of the variations of @xmath287^{-1}$ ] , @xmath288_{\\epsilon'}^{-1}=\\frac{\\omega^{2}}{c^{2}}\\delta\\epsilon'$ ] , weighted by the light ldos of each intermediate dielectric configuration of permittivity @xmath289 , @xmath290 . because the schwinger - bulk energy can be written as an integral in momenta by identifying @xmath291 , @xmath292 eg .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath293 dependence of @xmath294 can be fairly attributed to its @xmath295 dependence @xcite . on the contrary",
    ", @xmath296 is just the light ldos of the final configuration of permittivity @xmath222 and is simply proportional to @xmath297 .",
    "alternatively , the relation @xmath298 can be obtained if one starts from fermi s golden rule and restrict the quadratic vacuum fluctuations to those of the dyson field .",
    "the macroscopic quantization of each field operator yields a factor @xmath299 while the remainder is the sum over momenta proportional to @xmath293 @xcite .",
    "note however that we have defined originally the ldoses through relations of the form of eq.([ldosf ] ) .",
    "that is , by definition an ldos is proportional to the imaginary part of some physically meaningful green s function .",
    "it is in this sense that @xmath300 derives ( i.e. , is not defined ) from the original @xmath16 and likewise for the ldos of @xmath234 which derives from @xmath82 .",
    "+ second , let us emphasize that @xmath16 must not be identified with the total radiative ldos . as mentioned in section [ polarizability ] , both the stimulated and the spontaneous emission of a point dipole are proportional to the quadratic fluctuations of the self - polarization field in @xmath192 @xcite .",
    "thus , we can write , @xmath301 the above expression together with eqs.([sl],[sp ] ) and eqs.([ldosiper],[ldosiparal ] ) show clearly that it is not @xmath16 is denoted by @xmath302 in @xcite .",
    "also in this context , radiative emission is synonym of far field emission . ] _ the relevant part of the ldos entering femi s golden rule in the descriptions of the rate of spontaneous radiative decay _ as erroneously claimed in @xcite .",
    "this has been appreciated by a number of authors see eg .",
    "@xcite who have attributed the discrepancy to the presence of lffs which relate the microscopical field to the macroscopical - maxwell field .",
    "we have proved microscopically that this is indeed the case , but rather than relating microscopical and macroscopical fields , lffs in fermi s golden rule relate the self - polarization propagator to the dyson - bulk propagator , they both being computed at the same microscopical level .",
    "lffs emerge in fermi s golden rule as a result of taking proper account of correlations .",
    "we found in section [ class ] that the correct statement is that it is only the power transferred radiatively and directly from the emitter into the medium that has the spectrum of external light .",
    "there are other contributions to the total power which , although not transferred directly from the emitter into the medium , are radiative anyways .",
    "in particular , the _ indirect _ coherent emission is of course radiative , although that emission is carried out by induced dipoles and not by the emitter itself . in the far field , at a distance much greater than the typical correlation length between the emitter and the surrounding dipoles , it would not be possible to distinguish between _ direct _ and _ indirect _ coherent radiation . +",
    "the restrictive identification in @xcite of the radiative ldos with @xmath16 seems to have led to confusion on the authors of @xcite who are interested in the relation between the refractive index and the radiative decay rate of an emitter embedded in a random medium .",
    "they argue that , since in the long - wavelength limit of the effective medium theory , @xmath303 , the dielectric constant becomes a local and isotropic function , correlation effects can be disregarded and the effective transverse propagator of eq.([deff ] ) determines the radiative ldos which enters fermi s golden rule . on the contrary , because under no physically acceptable condition @xmath304 holds eg .",
    "@xmath305 , that argument is generically erroneous . +",
    "a similar reasoning applies to @xcite where the authors study the radiative decay of a dipole emitter embedded in a piecewise continuous dielectric .",
    "they take as ldos of reference that of a homogeneous ( i.e. one - piece ) medium , @xmath306 .",
    "however that is not the appropriate ldos for emission but for light propagation .",
    "the reason being that it is not possible to embed an emitter in a continuous medium and take a continuous limit such that the emitter forms part of the medium and the effects of lffs disappear  eg . in the limit @xmath307 of an onsager cavity of radius @xmath308 ,",
    "@xmath309 @xcite .",
    "otherwise , unphysical divergences appear for the case that the permittivity be a complex number . in conclusion , while @xmath16 is well defined in a strictly homogeneous medium , @xmath82 is not .",
    "the computation of @xmath310 in @xcite for an heterogeneous medium is correct provided that the dielectric function takes proper account of the emitter embedding .",
    "however , in such a case there are no divergences in @xmath311 and there is no need to restrict the radiative ldos to @xmath312 as claimed by the authors .",
    "in particular , the statement that @xmath313 in a medium of real dielectric constant is in general incorrect . if properly computed , @xmath314 in an effective medium yields only coherent modes .",
    "+ note however that if one were interested only in detecting the band gaps of radiative emission in an effective medium , the detection of the gaps of @xmath16 , which correspond to bands of total reflectivity , might suffice .",
    "the reason is that , for an effective medium like that of an mg dielectric , the total radiative spectrum is given by @xmath315 @xcite .",
    "therefore , unless the lffs diverge at those frequencies at which the index of refraction vanishes , the gaps on @xmath28 coincide with those of the spectrum of total radiation .",
    "it is to this respect that the work of @xcite is still useful . in physical terms",
    ", this implies that there does not exist coupling of either the emitter itself or the surrounding induced dipoles to propagating modes .",
    "this however does not preclude the non - radiative energy transfer between the emitter and the induced dipoles .",
    "+ finally , a comment is in order on the application of eqs.([ldosiper]-[xi ] ) to the spontaneous decay rate of a dipole in a statistically homogeneous complex medium .",
    "when the emission is stimulated , under stationary conditions the rate at which the dipole absorbs the energy supplied by the external source is ( ideally ) balanced by the rate at which the dipole radiates that energy .",
    "therefore , its polarizability can be considered at any time equivalent to that of the rest of dipoles in the medium and eqs.([ldosiper]-[xi ] ) are strictly applicable so that @xmath316 . in contrast ,",
    "when the dipole decays spontaneously from an excited state , its polarizability is in general different to that of the rest of surrounding dipoles .",
    "this brakes manifestly the statistical translation - invariance of the medium at the emitter location since it behaves as an impurity . as a consequence , eqs.([ldosiper]-[xi ] ) may be applicable only in an approximate manner .",
    "this is at the root of the distinction between the virtual cavity and the real cavity scenarios @xcite .",
    "the computation of @xmath98 and the measurement of all the components of @xmath317 can be simulated numerically using the so - called coupled - dipole - method ( cdm ) @xcite . in that method , the transference matrix @xmath318 of subsection [ light ] is computed for each configuration of point dipoles before performing the average over the configuration ensemble .",
    "let us take one of those configurations composed by @xmath17 host scatterers .",
    "we decide to stimulate the dipole at @xmath94 with an incident ( inc ) monochromatic field of frequency @xmath319 , @xmath130 .",
    "that is , @xmath320 if @xmath321 and @xmath322 otherwise .",
    "generally the dipoles are not all equivalent and have different renormalized polarizabilities @xmath323 , @xmath324 .",
    "therefore , the dipole moment of the emitter reads in terms of the incident field , @xmath325 on the other hand , the total field at the emitter location is the sum of the incident field plus the self - polarization field which the dipole moment @xmath326 itself creates at @xmath94 .",
    "that is , @xmath327 where @xmath328 is the self - polarization propagator of the @xmath86 dipole for the scatterer configuration considered .",
    "the @xmath4-dependence is omitted hereafter .",
    "our interest is in the second term on the _ r.h.s .",
    "_ of eq.([eemit ] ) .",
    "it can be written also as the sum of all the fields which propagate from each of the induced dipoles to @xmath94 , @xmath329 except for the emitter , the rest of dipoles are only induced by their mutual interactions .",
    "the dipole moments induced can be computed formally using the @xmath318-matrix of the system . @xmath330 yields the dipole induced at some point @xmath38 as a result of its interaction with the dipole excited by the incident field at some point @xmath39",
    ". the dipole moment of a dipole located at @xmath38 reads , @xmath331 because in our case the only dipole excited externally is that at @xmath94 , we get @xmath332 inserting eq.([lapi ] ) into eq.([pemit ] ) we end up with , @xmath333 should all the dipoles be equivalent with @xmath26 @xmath334 and density @xmath335 , it is immediate to obtain @xmath336 as given in eq.([infunctionoft ] ) . +",
    "a comment is in order concerning the use of the renormalized single particle polarizabilities in the above formulae . in simulations",

    "a priori _ additional renormalizations were carried out by draine and goodman in @xcite and chaumet _ et al . _ in @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , it must be clear by now that because the @xmath103-factors depend on the renormalized value of @xmath98 and @xmath98 receives radiative corrections from the @xmath103-factors , the problem is one of self - consistency . in physical terms , this reflects the double and complementary role that actual dipoles play in a complex medium . on the one hand ,",

    "<S> we offer a unified approach to several phenomena related to the electromagnetic vacuum of a complex medium made of point electric dipoles . to this aim , we apply the linear response theory to the computation of the polarization field propagator and study the spectrum of vacuum fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the physical distinction among the local density of states which enter the spectra of light propagation , total dipole emission , coherent emission , total vacuum energy and schwinger - bulk energy is made clear . </S>",
    "<S> analytical expressions for the spectrum of dipole emission and for the vacuum energy are derived . </S>",
    "<S> their respective relations with the spectrum of external light and with the schwinger - bulk energy are found . the light spectrum and the schwinger - bulk energy </S>",
    "<S> are determined by the dyson propagator . the emission spectrum and the total vacuum energy </S>",
    "<S> are determined by the polarization propagator . </S>",
    "<S> an exact relationship of proportionality between both propagators is found in terms of local field factors . </S>",
    "<S> a study of the nature of stimulated emission from a single dipole is carried out . regarding coherent emission , it contains two components . a direct one </S>",
    "<S> which is transferred radiatively and directly from the emitter into the medium and whose spectrum is that of external light . and an indirect one which is radiated by induced dipoles . the induction is mediated by one ( and only one ) local field factor . regarding the vacuum energy , we find that in addition to the schwinger - bulk energy the vacuum energy of an effective medium contains local field contributions proportional to the resonant frequency and to the spectral line - width . </S>"
