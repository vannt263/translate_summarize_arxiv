    "magnetic nanoparticles have attracted increasing interest among researchers of various fields due to their promising applications in hard disk drives , magnetic random access memory , and other spintronic devices .",
    "smw+00,kda+98,cka+99,wab+01,gbh+02 in addition , these magnetic nanoparticles can be used for potential biomedical applications , such as magnetic resonance imaging ( the nanoparticles can be used to trace bioanalytes in the body ) , cell and dna separation , and drug delivery .",
    "et03 to apply nanoparticles in various potential devices and architectures , it is very important to control their size and shape in order to keep the thermal and chemical stability .",
    "@xcite    the trusty sphere remains the preferred shape for nanoparticles but this geometry leaves only one surface for modification , complicating the generation of multifunctional particles .",
    "thus , a technology that could modify differentially the inner and outer surfaces would be highly desirable .",
    "@xcite tubular nanostructures have stimulated extensive research efforts in recent years because of their particular significance for prospective applications .",
    "a wide range of materials including semiconductors , polymers , and metals have been prepared in the form of nanotubes .",
    "@xcite although the magnetic nanotubes has been intensely investigated , barcode - type nanostructures have received less attention , in spite of tailoring the multisegmented nanotube structure , along with the functionalization of the inner wall surface of barcode - type nanotubes with various molecules ( for example , proteins and dna ) . moreover ,",
    "they are expected to be particularly useful in the field of catalysis , advanced microfluidics , molecule separation and biological and magnetic sensors as well . lsn+05,ngr+01,lehmann02,ncs+03,scm+06,srh+05",
    "it is worth to mention that barcode - type magnetic nanostructures consisting of regular arrays of magnetic segments have been considered as providing the basis for extending magnetic storage densities beyond the superparamagnetic limit . in such system ,",
    "a single tube with @xmath0 magnetic layers might store up to 2@xmath1 bits , whose volume is much larger than those of the grains in conventional recording media , bearing this way thermal fluctuations and increasing the recording density by a factor 2@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite  recently , @xcite the preparation of metallic nanotubes based on the preferential electrodeposition of a metal along the pore walls of an anodic alumina oxide ( aao ) membrane , in the presence of metallic nanoparticles on the wall surfaces , has been reported . in the paper by lee _ _  et al__. @xcite they were able to prepare multisegmented metallic nanotubes with a bimetallic stacking configuration along the tube axis , showing different magnetic behavior as compared with continuous ones , which encourage a study about the possible magnetic configurations and magnetostatic interactions in these barcode - type magnetic nanotubes .",
    "clearly , for the development of magnetic devices based on those arrays , knowledge of the internal magnetic structure of the barcode - type nanostructures is of fundamental importance .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the magnetic ordering of barcode - type nanostructures .",
    "our particles are characterized by a set of geometrical parameters , as depicted in fig .",
    "first , their external and internal radii , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , and total length , @xmath5 , which includes the magnetic matter as well as the nonmagnetic one .",
    "it is convenient to define the ratio @xmath6 , so that @xmath7 represents a solid cylinder and @xmath8 corresponds to a very narrow tube .",
    "we denote with @xmath9 the length of each ferromagnetic segment and with @xmath10 the length of each nonmagnetic portion , so that , if we have a barcode - type structure with @xmath0 magnetic tubes , the total length can be written as @xmath11 .",
    "we adopt a simplified description of the magnetic system in which the discrete distribution of magnetic moments is replaced by a continuous one , defined by the magnetization vector field @xmath12 such that @xmath13 gives the total magnetic moment within an elementary volume @xmath14 centered at @xmath15 . the total magnetic energy ( @xmath16 ) is generally given by the sum of four terms : exchange , dipolar , anisotropy and zeeman contributions , which are taken from the well known continuum theory of ferromagnetism . @xcite as we are interested in the study of the relative stability of the zero - field magnetic ground states , the contribution of the zeeman energy can be disregarded . under these assumptions ,",
    "the magnetic energy is just given by the dipolar ( @xmath17 ) , exchange ( @xmath18 ) , and anisotropy ( @xmath19 ) contributions .",
    "the total magnetization can be written as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the magnetization of the @xmath22-th ferromagnetic segment . in this case , the magnetostatic potential @xmath23 splits up into @xmath0 components , @xmath24 , associated with the magnetization of each ferromagnetic segment .",
    "then , the total dipolar energy can be written as @xmath25 @xmath26 , where @xmath27is the dipolar contribution to the self - energy of the @xmath22-th ferromagnetic segment , and @xmath28is the dipolar interaction between ferromagnetic segments @xmath22 and @xmath29 .    usually , the exchange energy @xmath18 in multilayer nanostructures has contributions from both , the direct exchange interaction within the magnetic segments and the other from the indirect interaction between them mediated by the conduction electrons in the nonmagnetic layers .",
    "since the indirect interaction decays rapidly with the thickness of the nonmagnetic segment , it can be neglected provided @xmath10 is large enough .",
    "a good estimate of the range of the indirect exchange interaction can be obtained from the results for multilayers .",
    "@xcite as a general result , the interlayer exchange coupling vanishes for spacer thicknesses greater than a few nanometers , which does not exceed the value of the exchange length @xmath30 of ferromagnetic metals .",
    "here we focus our attention on those cases in which @xmath10 is not smaller than the magnetic material s @xmath31 , as the tubes fabricated by lee _",
    "et al_. @xcite which satisfy @xmath10 @xmath32 @xmath31 and thus interlayer exchange coupling can be safety neglected .",
    "therefore , to a good approximation can be written as @xmath33 @xmath34 , where @xmath35 dv$ ] . here , @xmath36 is the magnetization normalized to the saturation magnetization @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the stiffness constant of the magnetic material",
    ".    the cubic anisotropy energy of the particle can be added by means of the following expression:@xmath39and the uniaxial anisotropy energy is given by@xmath40    on the basis of the above results , the total energy of the barcode - type nanostructure can be written as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 @xmath43 is the self - energy of the ferromagnetic segment @xmath22 , and @xmath44 is the ( dipolar ) interaction energy between two magnetic segments .",
    "we will proceed to describe the magnetization of the different states we are considering here and then we will evaluate the magnetic energy of each configuration .",
    "results will be given in units of @xmath45 , i.e. , @xmath46 .",
    "it has been shown recently that single magnetic nanorings present three basic ground states depending on their geometry ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . @xcite these configurations are : ( fz ) a quasi uniform magnetization state oriented in the direction parallel to the cylindrical axis ( @xmath47 axis ) ; ( fx ) a quasi uniform magnetization state oriented in the plane perpendicular to the @xmath47 axis ; and ( v ) a flux - closure vortex state . for long nanorings @xmath48 ,",
    "the fx phase is not present , @xcite a result that holds for nanotubes .",
    "@xcite    it has been shown for rothman _",
    "et al_. @xcite that for magnetized nanorings the single - domain in - plane ground state is the _ onion _ state .",
    "besides , the single - domain axial state for rings with small inner diameter might be similar to the _ flower _ state expected in thick axially magnetized cylinders .",
    "@xcite therefore , it may appear questionable to select the uniform in - plane and axial as single - domain states to build the phase diagram upon , as they are not stable configurations at a zero applied field .",
    "however , it has been verified by micromagnetic simulations @xcite and analytical calculations @xcite that the energy difference between the actual single - domain ground state in a nanoring , and the uniform state , often turns out to be very small . from this available evidence ,",
    "we conclude that the replacement of the more correct quasi - uniform states by simpler ideal uniform states , only results in uncertainties on the exact location of the phase boundaries and on some physical values extracted from the phase diagram .      for the fz state , where the magnetization of the @xmath0 ferromagnetic segments is uniform and parallel to the @xmath47 axis , @xmath49 can be approximated by @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the unit vector parallel to the axis of the nanotube . in this case",
    "the exchange contribution to the self energy vanishes , and the reduced self energy takes the form ela+07",
    "@xmath52where @xmath53  is a bessel function of the first kind and @xmath54 . in order to calculate the interaction energy between the ferromagnetic segments , we first need to calculate the magnetostatic potential @xmath55 of a single tubular structure .",

    "thus we write , @xmath57 with@xmath58   \\\\ \\left ( -e^{-k\\left\\vert \\frac{w}{2}-z\\right\\vert } + e^{-k\\left\\vert -\\frac{w}{% 2}-z\\right\\vert } \\right ) \\end{gathered}\\]]and@xmath59 y\\left ( w , z\\right ) , \\]]where @xmath60 .",

    "the exchange and anisotropy contributions to the self energy vanish and the reduced self energy takes the form @xcite",
    "@xmath73where @xmath53  is a bessel function of the first kind . in order to calculate the interaction energy between the ferromagnetic segments , we first need to calculate the magnetostatic potential @xmath23 of a single tubular structure .",

    "we can conclude that for zero applied field the total energy of this state is further reduced for the value @xmath79 , independently of the value of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , for the particular case when @xmath79 we obtain @xmath80 + \\left ( 1+e^{q\\sigma } \\right ) n}{\\left ( 1+e^{q\\sigma } \\right ) ^{2}}$ ] .      finally , for the vortex state v , @xmath70 can be approximated by @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the azimuthal unit vector . due to the condition of perfect flux closure in the vortex configuration , one magnetic nanostructure in such configuration",
    "does not interact with others , independently of the magnetic configuration of those .",
    "thus , there is no difference between clockwise and counter - clockwise directions .",
    "finally , the reduced total energy for the vortex state is given just by the @xmath0  self energies @xcite@xmath83here , @xmath84 .",
    "we proceed to investigate the relative stability of the configurations .",
    "phase diagrams are shown in fig . 3 for @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 .    ,",

    "iron , permalloy and nickel have cubic ( @xmath90 ) anisotropy . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the diagrams show three regions , corresponding to configurations fz , fx , and v , as in the case of a single nanoring ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "notice that for the case of co , the existence of a strong uniaxial anisotropy favors the fz phase , decreasing the other two phases , specially the v one .",
    "in the case of a cubic anisotropy , the transition lines are similar to the case of a phase diagram without anisotropy . because of its very low anisotropy , results for permalloy describe reasonably well a material with no anisotropy , as it was pointed in ref . [",
    "since nanostructures are usually polycrystalline , the crystallographic orientations of the crystallites are random and , as a consequence , the average magnetic anisotropy of the particle is very small . in view of that",
    ", it will be neglected in our calculations .",
    "@xcite    for different values of @xmath0 we can determine the ranges of values of the dimensionless radius @xmath92 and length @xmath93 within which one of the three configurations is of lowest energy .",
    "the boundary line between any two configurations can be obtained by equating the expressions for the corresponding total energies .",
    "figure 4 illustrates phase diagrams for @xmath94 , @xmath86 , and @xmath91 ( solid lines ) , @xmath95 ( dotted lines ) , and @xmath96 ( dashed lines ) .",
    "it is important to observe that for the fz and fx states the exchange energy is the same .",
    "then , in the absence of applied magnetic fields and crystalline anisotropies , the dipolar energy is fundamental to obtain the magnetic configuration of lowest energy .",
    "thus , the dipolar contribution represents the shape anisotropy that , for multisegmented nanostructures with a small length ( namely nanorings ) the low energy state is the quasi uniform in - plane configuration fx .",
    "@xcite as the length is increased , but keeping the radius small enough , there is a transition to the out - of - plane state fz at a critical length whose value depends on @xmath3 , @xmath97 , and the exchange length @xmath31 . as the radius is increased , the magnetizations turns to the vortex configuration at a critical radius depending on the values of @xmath9 , @xmath97 , and @xmath31 .",

    "such trajectories are shown in fig . 5 for @xmath85 and different values of @xmath0 .",
    "we remark that the radius @xmath99 of the triple point represents the smallest value of @xmath3 for which the vortex configurations are stable , and @xmath100  is the biggest value of @xmath9 for which the in - plane configurations are stable .    , for @xmath91 ( squares ) , 3 ( circles ) , and 5 ( triangles).,width=302 ]      as the multisegmented tubes that motivate this work @xcite satisfy @xmath101 , then the fx phase can be left out of consideration . thus , to obtain an expression for the transition line separating the fz phase from the v phase we match the expressions for the energy of these two configurations .",

    "@xcite as it is known , the consideration of no uniform magnetic configurations complicates considerably the calculations and for simplicity , we studied multisegment magnetic nanotubes whose radius are not big enough to allows the formation of relevant vortex domains at the extremes of the tube .",
