    "while shapes of dark matter halos have been conventionally modeled as spherical @xcite , optical , x - ray and lensing observations of galaxy clusters suggest that the shapes of dark halos are far from spherical @xcite .",
    "recent high - resolution simulations do indicate that the density profiles of dark halos are better approximated as triaxial @xcite .",
    "* js02 hereafter ) were able to construct a detailed empirical model for the triaxial halo for the first time .",
    "their fitting model turned out to be quite useful in quantifying the triaxiality effect on many important observables such as the strong lensing arc statistics @xcite , the halo mass - temperature relation @xcite , and the halo figure rotation @xcite .",
    "the most fundamental statistics characterizing the halo triaxiality is the axis - ratio , or equivalently , ellipticity distribution functions . @xcite",
    "have shown from their n - body simulations that the axis - ratio distributions depend on the halo environments in addition to the underlying cosmology . in order to exploit the halo axis - ratio distribution as a cosmological probe ,",
    "therefore , one needs an analytic model beyond the empirical fitting formulae .",
    "this is exactly what we attempt to propose in this paper .",
    "in fact , the triaxial shape of a dark halo is a generic prediction of the cdm ( cold dark matter ) paradigm . @xcite",
    "already derived an analytic expression of the halo axis - ratio distribution _ assuming _ that dark halos form at peaks of the primordial gaussian density field .",
    "they showed theoretically that the cdm dark halos can not be spherical as pointed out earlier by @xcite . however , recent numerical results mentioned above have demonstrated that simulated dark halos are even more elliptical than expected in the previous density peak approach .",
    "this is why we revisit this problem using different analytical approaches .    to construct a new theoretical model for the halo axis - ratio distribution",
    ", we adopt the cosmic web picture @xcite which describes one dimensional filaments in the cdm framework . according to the picture",
    ", the distribution and spatial coherence of initial tidal fields induces the filamentary pattern of the large scale structure .",
    "later the filaments bridge between dark matter halos , and the merging of dark halos occur preferentially along the bridging filaments .",
    "thus the resulting halos can not be spherical but naturally become elongated along the filaments .",
    "the halo ellipticities are expected to increase as the hierarchical merging along the filaments proceeds .",
    "therefore , the halo axis - ratio can be inferred statistically by combining an evolution model of non - spherical density perturbations and the primordial filamentarity of the initial density field .    in order to examine the validity of our analytical model",
    ", we compare the predictions with the simulation results by js02 . for that purpose ,",
    "we consider two specific sets of cosmological parameters that they adopted .",
    "the first model is @xmath0cdm model which assumes that @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the matter density parameter and the dimensionless cosmological constant , and @xmath7 is the amplitude of the mass fluctuation at @xmath8mpc .",
    "since js02 use the cdm transfer function of @xcite neglecting the baryon contribution , the shape parameter @xmath9 simply equals @xmath10 .",
    "the second model is scdm model where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "js02 considered dark halos consisting of more than @xmath15 particles . since",
    "a mass of a simulation particle is @xmath16 ( @xmath17 particles in @xmath18mpc comoving cube ) , it is convenient to define the dimensionless mass of @xmath19 .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes our basic assumptions in the analytic modeling .",
    "we lay out mathematical details of derivation of the axis ratio distributions in  3 , and compare the analytic results with their simulation results in  4 .",
    "finally  5 is devoted to discussion and conclusions .",
    "to derive the axis - ratio distribution of dark matter halos , we adopt three major assumptions .",
    "first , the trajectory of a dark matter particle in the comoving coordinate is well approximated by the zeldovich formula @xcite . according to the approximation ,",
    "the key quantities are the three eigenvalues ( @xmath20 ) of the deformation tensor ( or the tidal shear tensor ) , @xmath21 , which is defined as the second derivative of the perturbation potential , @xmath22 , at the initial epoch @xmath23 : @xmath24 the mapping from the lagrangian to the eulerian spaces yields an expression of the particle density @xmath25 in the eulerian space @xmath26 at redshift @xmath27 : @xmath28 [ 1 - \\tilde{d}_{+}(z)\\lambda_{2 } ] [ 1 - \\tilde{d}_{+}(z)\\lambda_{3 } ] } , \\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the background density of the universe , and @xmath30 denotes the linear growth rate of density fluctuations up to @xmath27 but normalized to unity at redshift @xmath23 . note that @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 in equation ( [ eqn : density ] ) represent the eigenvalues of @xmath21 defined at @xmath34 . in practice ,",
    "we use the following fitting formula @xcite : @xmath35^{1/2 } \\int_{z}^{\\infty}\\frac{1+z^{\\prime } } { [ \\omega_{m}(1+z^{\\prime})^{3 } + \\omega_{\\lambda}]^{3/2}}\\ dz^{\\prime}.\\ ] ] the _ linear _ density contrast , @xmath36 , at @xmath23 is simply written as @xmath37 second , we assume that a dark matter halo of mass @xmath38 forms at redshift @xmath27 when the corresponding lagrangian region ( at @xmath23 ) in the linear density field smoothed over @xmath38 satisfies the following conditions : @xmath39 where @xmath36 and @xmath33 are the linear density contrast and the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath21 of the smoothed density field , respectively . here",
    "@xmath40 and @xmath41 are redshift - dependent threshold of @xmath36 and lower limit of @xmath33 , respectively : @xmath42 we use the collapse threshold @xmath43 computed in the spherical model . for scdm , it is @xmath44 . for @xmath0cdm",
    ", we use the formula given in appendix b of @xcite , which depends weakly on cosmology .    in the spherical approximation",
    ", the condition of @xmath45 is sufficient for the gravitational collapse at @xmath27 . in the non - spherical model based on the zeldovich approximation , however , all regions satisfying @xmath46 do not necessarily collapse into dark halos , since @xmath33 can be negative even when @xmath47 .",
    "this is why we impose the additional condition ( [ eqn : cons ] ) in our model based on the zeldovich approximation .",
    "nevertheless no reliable modeling is known which determines the value of @xmath48 from physical principles .",
    "while the zeldovich approximation suggests @xmath49 , those objects are subject to the first - shell crossing , beyond which the zeldovich approximation is not valid at all .",
    "indeed , @xcite empirically proposed a value of @xmath50 in their mass function theory .",
    "they argue that realistic collapse should proceed along all the three axes almost simultaneously .",
    "thus the collapse along the major axis should be accelerated by the collapse along the other two directions , resulting in a lower value of @xmath48 . throughout this paper , we adopt their value of @xmath50 unless otherwise stated ( see  3 ) .",
    "third , the principal axes of the inertia tensor of a dark matter halo are aligned with that of the linear tidal shear tensor of the corresponding lagrangian region . approximating that the density profile of a dark matter halo as a triaxial ellipsoid with three distinct axes , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 ( we define @xmath54 )",
    ", one can say that the inertia shape tensor of a dark halo has three distinct eigenvalues , @xmath55 .",
    "the three eigenvalues of the halo inertia tensor , @xmath56 , are related to the eigenvalues of the tidal shear tensor , @xmath57 as @xmath58 it may be interesting to compare our definition of the halo axes ( eq.[[eqn : abc ] ] ) with that of the density peak formalism @xcite . in the density peak formalism , the three eigenvalues of the halo inertia tensor are defined as @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 are the three eigenvalues of the second derivative of _ the linear density field _ , @xmath63 .",
    "the comparison of two equations ( [ eqn : abc ] ) and ( [ eqn : den_abc ] ) shows that in the density peak formalism the inertia shape tensor of a dark halo is almost independent of the tidal shear tensor , @xmath21 , while in our formalism which basically assumes that the ellipticity of a dark halo is induced by the filamentary cosmic web , it is directly related with @xmath21 .",
    "in fact , the strong correlation between the halo inertia and the tidal shear tensors was demonstrated by recent n - body simulations @xcite .",
    "the above three assumptions imply that dark matter halos preferentially form at the over - dense nodes of the filamentary web of the initial density field where the principal axes of the inertia and the tidal tensors are aligned with each other . using these simplified assumptions ,",
    "we derive analytically the distribution of the axis - ratios of dark halos in the following two sections .",
    "we start from the joint probability distribution of the three eigenvalues of the tidal shear tensor in the primordial gaussian density field @xcite : @xmath64 where @xmath65 we define @xmath66 as the rms fluctuation of the linear density field at @xmath23 smoothed on mass scale @xmath38 : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the linear power spectrum of the density field , and @xmath69 is the top - hat filter with @xmath70^{1/3}$ ] .",

    "the second constraint @xmath84 guarantees that @xmath76 and @xmath77 are all real . note that if @xmath84 , then it automatically implies @xmath85 . according to equation ( [ eqn : con_lamdel ] )",
    ", however , @xmath31 has a non - zero probability of @xmath86 .",
    "we simply do not consider the parameter region of @xmath87 since they correspond to the break - down of the zeldovich approximation in the non - linear regime after the first - shell crossing ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "now , we write the probability density that a dark matter halo of mass @xmath38 formed at redshift @xmath89 has a intermediate - to - major axis ratio of @xmath90 and the minor - to - major axis ratio of @xmath91 as @xmath92 \\left|\\frac{(\\partial\\lambda_{1}\\partial\\lambda_{2 } ) } { ( \\partial\\mu_{1}\\partial\\mu_{2})}\\right|,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we solve equation ( [ eqn : mus ] ) for @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 as @xmath93 in the above expression , @xmath94 and @xmath95 depend on the formation redshift , @xmath89 : @xmath96 and @xmath97 , and @xmath98 is the heaviside step function .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath99 satisfies @xmath100 d\\mu_{1}d\\mu_{2 } = 1 .",

    "the axis - ratio distribution at the _ observation epoch _ , @xmath27 , can be readily found as @xmath106 where the formation epoch distribution , @xmath107 , represents the probability that a halo of mass @xmath108 that exists at @xmath27 had a mass greater than @xmath38 for the first time at @xmath89 .",
    "since the formation epoch distribution in the current non - spherical model is almost impossible to work out analytically , we use the spherical counterpart instead . in practice",
    "we use the fitting formula by @xcite for the analytic expression derived by @xcite .",
    "let us emphasize the difference between equations ( [ eqn : capro ] ) and ( [ eqn : capro_z ] ) : while the former gives the probability density that a dark halo of mass @xmath38 has a minor - to - major axis ratio @xmath91 at its formation redshift @xmath109 , the latter is the counterpart evaluated at the observation redshift @xmath110 .",
    "of course , in numerical simulations and observations , the latter , not the former , is the relevant observable . in what follows ,",
    "therefore , we mainly consider the latter evaluated at the _ observation _ epoch , @xmath27 .",
    "figure [ fig : lamc ] plots the @xmath48-dependence of @xmath111 in the @xmath0cdm model : @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 ( dotted , dashed , long - dashed , solid , dot - dashed , and dot - long - dashed lines , respectively ) . for this plot",
    ", we choose the halo mass @xmath118 at @xmath119 for definiteness .",
    "the axis - ratio distribution of dark halos shifts toward the high axis - ratio side ( more spherical ) as @xmath48 increases .",
    "this is theoretically understandable since higher values of @xmath48 correspond to those lagrangian regions whose major axis lengths are closer to the other two ( see eq.[[eqn : abc ] ] )",
    ". given such , we adopt @xmath50 in the analysis below , following @xcite    figure [ fig : redm ] shows how @xmath120 depends on the halo mass and the redshift for the case of @xmath0cdm .",
    "the upper panel shows the @xmath27-dependence of @xmath121 for a fixed mass scale of @xmath122 at redshift @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 ( solid , dotted , dashed , long - dashed , and dot - dashed ) respectively . while the lower panel plots the mass - dependence of @xmath121 at @xmath119 for @xmath128 and @xmath129 ( solid , dotted , dashed , long - dashed , and dot - dashed ) respectively .",
    "as can be seen , the analytic distribution @xmath120 depends on the halo mass and redshift consistently : the distribution moves toward the high axis - ratio section as the halo mass and the redshift increase .    in other words ,",
    "our analytic model predicts that the more massive a dark halos is , the less elliptical it is , and that a dark halo of given mass is less elliptical at earlier epochs .",
    "these two trends are consistent with the theoretical work of @xcite . by applying the perturbation theory to a primordial gaussian density field",
    ", he proved theoretically that the larger halos formed at higher density peaks are rounder .",
    "however , these trends are opposite to what is found through accurate calculations of n - body simulations : it was found in simulations that the more massive halos are more elliptical , and that the halos of given mass observed at earlier epochs are more elliptical @xcite .",
    "this failure of our analytic model implies that the dependences of the axis - ratio distributions on mass and redshift are not fully determined by simply applying the zeldovich approximation .",
    "figure [ fig : pro_ac ] shows our analytic prediction ( eq.[[eqn : capro_z ] ] ) at @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 ( top , middle , and bottom , respectively ) for three mass scales @xmath130 ( solid , dotted , and dashed , respectively ) .",
    "they should be compared with the numerical results ( histograms ) from js02 for the @xmath0cdm ( left panels ) and the scdm ( right panels ) .",
    "clearly the analytic predictions agree with the numerical results reasonably well ; they reproduce well shapes and characteristic behaviors ( especially for @xmath0cdm ) such as the peak positions , the dispersions , and the decrease of the mean axis - ratios with the increase of redshift . on the other hand ,",
    "we notice that the numerical histograms slightly move toward the low axis ratio section as the halo mass increases , which disagrees with the analytical predictions .",
    "we discuss on this disagreement between the analytical and the numerical results in @xmath131 .",
    "the probability density , @xmath132 , that a dark halo of mass @xmath38 is observed at redshift @xmath27 to have an intermediate - to - major axis ratio of @xmath90 can be also computed in a similar manner . however , to investigate the overall triaxiality of a dark halo , what is more relevant is the _",

    "the minor - to - major axis ratio is fixed to be @xmath144 .",

    "the agreement between analytic and numerical results is quite satisfactory .",
    "we have derived an analytic expression for the axis - ratio distribution of triaxial dark matter halos for the first time . in constructing the analytic model",
    ", we adopted the cosmic web picture in which the ellipticities of dark matter halos are induced by the coherent tidal fields in the initial density fluctuations , and employed the zeldovich - type collapse condition as a diagnostics .",
    "our analytic model is successful in reproducing the basic behaviors on a qualitative level found from the previous numerical simulations ( js02 ) .",
    "this ensures our basic picture that the origin of the halo triaxiality is the filamentarity of the initial density field .",
    "nevertheless we found a discrepancy with the numerical results on a quantitative level ; in particular the predicted dependences of the halo triaxiality on mass and redshift seem inconsistent with the numerical results .    in order for the future improvements ,",
    "let us critically discuss possible caveats in our analytic approaches : first of all , we use a cooked - up collapse condition of @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "what we really mean to have is a practical and simple collapse condition for the formation of a triaxial dark halo in the nodes of filamentary web of the density field by combining the density peak formalism and the zeldovich approximation .",
    "this collapse condition is theoretically unjustified .    how to identify a triaxial halo and where to locate the corresponding lagrangian site in the linear density field is a touchy issue in the non - spherical dynamical model .",
    "although @xcite proposed the peak patch picture as a complete non - spherical model , their formalism is too complicated to follow analytically in practice .",
    "besides , as discussed in @xcite , there is still no unanimous agreement among theory , observations , and simulations about how to define a gravitationally bound object in practice .",
    "the disagreement among the three become more serious when a dark halo is to be described as triaxial . hence , to find a theoretically justified criterion for the formation of a triaxial dark halo and to derive the axis - ratio distribution more rigorously with the criterion",
    ", it will be necessary to address this difficult issue first , which is beyond the scope of this paper .    as @xcite proved theoretically that a rare event in the linear density field is inclined to be quite spherical .",
    "in other words , a linear over - dense region of high - mass must be more spherical than a low - mass over - dense region .",
    "this is the case that our analytic distribution predicts .",
    "the difference in the trends with mass and redshift between our model and the simulation results may be caused by the fact that in reality the shape of a dark halo must be affected by subsequent nonlinear clustering process .",
    "we argue here that the nonlinear merging event must play a key role in increasing the halo ellipticity .",
    "many n - body studies demonstrated that the merging event occurs anisotropically along filaments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this anisotropic merging event tends to make the shapes of dark halos elongated by aligning their substructures along with the orientation of their major axes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , it was also shown that the merging process is more rapid for the case of higher mass halos @xcite .",
    "the tendency of being more spherical in the higher - mass section of the linear density field @xcite is likely to be compensated by the anisotropic merging effect .",
    "therefore , the overall dependence of the axis - ratio distribution on the halo mass and redshift may be weakened by this compensating effect .",
    "our future work is in the direction of incorporating semi - analytically the anisotropic merging process into our analytic model .    in passing ,",
    "it is interesting to note that the anisotropic merging of dark halos along filaments has an implication about the mass function of dark halos . in the standard mass function theory based on the press - schechter theory",
    ", the mass function is independent of the power - spectrum .",
    "if the merging really occurs in an anisotropic way along filaments , however , the filamentarity in the medium must affect the final mass distribution of dark halos .",
    "for example , for the case of a power - law spectrum , the mass function might depend on the power - law index sensitively , since the filamentarity of the density field should depend on the power - law index .",
    "we wish to present the effect of anisotropic merging on the mass distribution of dark halos in the near future ( lee & jing 2005 , in preparation ) .",
    "the discrepancy between our analytic model and the simulation results on the mass and redshift dependences implies that the shapes of dark halos are not fully determined by simply applying the zeldovich approximation .",
    "rather , one has to take into account complicated nonlinear gravitational clustering like the anisotropic merging event .",
    "nevertheless , the overall agreement of our analytic model with the simulation results gives us a hope that our analytic model will be useful in quantifying how the initial cosmic web induces the ellipticity of dark matter halos , and provide a first theoretical step toward the goal of using the ellipticity distribution of galaxy clusters as a new cosmological probe ( lee 2005 , in preparation ) .",

    "<S> we present an analytic expression for the axis ratio distribution of triaxial dark matter halos driven from physical principles . adopting the picture of triaxial collapse based on the zeldovich approximation , we derive analytically both the minor - to - major and the conditional intermediate - to - major axis ratio distributions , and examine how they depend on the halo mass , redshift , and cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> our analytic model is tested against the simulation data given by jing & suto in 2002 , and found to reproduce the conditional intermediate - to - major axis ratio distribution successfully and the minor - to - major axis ratio distribution approximately . however , the trends of our analytic axis - ratio distributions with mass and redshift are opposite to what is found in n - body simulations . </S>",
    "<S> this failure of our analytic model puts a limitation on analytic approaches based on the lagrangian theory to the halo ellipticity . </S>",
    "<S> given the overall agreement with the simulation results , our model provides a new theoretical step toward using the axis - ratio distribution of dark halos as a cosmological probe . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss several possibilities to improve the model . </S>"
