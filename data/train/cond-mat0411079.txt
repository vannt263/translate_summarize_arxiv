    "the parameter @xmath4 is called the clauses - to - variables ratio .",
    "a @xmath0-sat formula is satisfiable ( sat ) if there exists at least one assignment of the boolean variables ( a solution ) such that all clauses are satisfied ; otherwise it is unsatisfiable ( unsat ) . for example , the @xmath3-sat formula @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 has a sat solution of @xmath18 . given a @xmath0-sat formula ,",
    "the objective is to judge whether it is satisfiable or not , and if it is , to find a satisfying solution .",
    "the satisfiability of a @xmath3-sat formula can be determined in a run time that scales linearly with the number @xmath13 of boolean variables @xcite . however , to determine the satisfiability of a @xmath0-sat formula with @xmath19 is np - complete , with a computation time that scales _ exponentially _ with @xmath13 in the worst case .",
    "the reason for this qualitative difference in computational complexity is still not completely clear .",

    "furthermore , although the @xmath0-sat problem ( @xmath26 ) in general is np - complete , the satisfiability of a randomly chosen formula can often be easily determined by a heuristic algorithm , provided that its parameter @xmath4 is _ not _ at the vicinity of the sat - unsat transition point @xmath24 .",
