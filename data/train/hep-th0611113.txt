    "search for a fundamental field - theoretical formulation of string theory began in the old days of dual resonance models .",
    "however , none of these attempts have been completed yet for the superstring theory .    the light - cone superstring field theory ( lcsft )",
    "is the most successful formulation thus far and was first constructed in @xcite .",
    "the starting point is the green - schwarz action in the light - cone gauge . out of the action",
    "we can construct the free hamiltonian @xmath0 and two free supercharges @xmath1 , which satisfy the supersymmetry algebra : @xmath2=[\\tilde q_0^{\\dot{a}},h_0]&=0 . \\label{susyalg2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the interaction terms are added to these charges so that the total charges satisfy the same supersymmetry algebra order by order .",
    "namely , we construct the interaction terms by replacing the free charges @xmath3 in , by the full order charges @xmath4 and determining the interaction terms order by order . the result for the first order interaction terms",
    "is @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the kinematical three - string interaction vertex constructed by the overlapping condition and @xmath7 @xmath8 is the holomorphic ( anti - holomorphic ) part of the bosonic momentum at the interaction point , whose divergence is regularized : @xmath9 with @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 being the interaction point .",
    "we take the range of @xmath13 to be @xmath14 , which implies @xmath15 for @xmath16 and @xmath17 for @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "@xmath19 is the step function and defined by @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) for @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "similarly , @xmath24 is the regularization of the fermionic momentum at the interaction point : @xmath25 and the prefactors @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are functions of @xmath24 and were originally given in complicated forms .",

    "note that the indices of the functions in  are consistent because cosh is an even function while sinh is an odd one . for more details of the prefactors , see appendix a. as pointed out in @xcite , these quantities satisfy the following fourier identities : @xmath36^{ij } & = \\left(\\alpha_{123}\\over 2\\right)^4\\int d^8\\phi\\ , e^{{2\\over \\alpha_{123}}\\phi^ay^a } \\bigl[\\cosh\\!\\not\\hspace{-1mm}\\phi\\bigr]^{ji } , \\label{fourier1}\\\\ \\bigl[\\sinh{\\!\\not\\hspace{-0.5mm}y}\\bigr]^{\\dot{a}i } & = -i\\left(\\alpha_{123}\\over 2\\right)^4\\int d^8\\phi\\ , e^{{2\\over \\alpha_{123}}\\phi^ay^a } \\bigl[\\sinh\\!\\not\\hspace{-1mm}\\phi\\bigr]^{i\\dot{a}},\\\\ \\bigl[\\sinh{\\!\\not\\hspace{-0.5mm}y}\\bigr]^{i\\dot{a } } & = i\\left(\\alpha_{123}\\over 2\\right)^4\\int d^8\\phi\\ , e^{{2\\over \\alpha_{123}}\\phi^ay^a } \\bigl[\\sinh\\!\\not\\hspace{-1mm}\\phi\\bigr]^{\\dot{a}i } , \\label{fourier3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which will play important roles in our following computation .",
    "the program of constructing the interaction terms is successful at the first order , though it is too complicated to proceed to higher orders .",
    "recently , there is a significant breakthrough in the construction @xcite .",
    "the point is to relate lcsft to another formulation of the superstring theory known as matrix string theory ( mst ) @xcite .",
    "mst stems from the matrix formulation of light - cone quantization of m - theory @xcite and takes the form of the maximally supersymmetric yang - mills theory . to relate mst to the perturbative string",
    ", we note that the yang - mills coupling constant @xmath37 is related to the string coupling constant @xmath38 and the string length @xmath39 by @xmath40 .",
    "hence , the free string limit corresponds to the ir limit and the first order interaction term to the least irrelevant operator . from the requirement of the dimension counting and the locality of the interaction",
    ", we expect that the first order interaction term is a dimension three operator constructed essentially out of the bosonic twist fields and the fermionic spin fields .",
    "the interaction term of mst is proposed to be @xcite @xmath41\\sigma^i\\bar{\\sigma}^j\\bigr)_{m , n } , \\label{msth1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the excited @xmath43 twist field defined as @xmath44 with @xmath45 being the elementary @xmath43 twist field .",
    "since the holomorphic part of the twist field does not completely decouple from the anti - holomorphic part due to the zero mode contribution , we combine them with the square parenthesis in . @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( which will appear later ) are the spin fields for the green - schwarz fermion @xmath48 . the indices @xmath49 and @xmath50 of the twist fields denote the string bits where the `` exchange '' interaction takes place .",
    "now we can find a close analogy between and and between and , if we regard @xmath51(z,\\bar{z})$ ] as @xmath6 and @xmath52(z,\\bar{z})$ ] as @xmath53 . following this analogy between lcsft and mst , two supercharges of mst",
    "were written down explicitly in @xcite : @xmath54\\sigma^{\\dot{a}}\\bar{\\sigma}^i\\bigr)_{m , n } , \\quad \\tilde{q}_1^{\\dot{a}}=\\sum_{m , n}\\int d\\sigma \\bigl([\\tau^i\\bar{\\sigma}]\\sigma^i\\bar{\\sigma}^{\\dot{a}}\\bigr)_{m , n},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the supersymmetry algebra was checked .",
    "these arguments of supercharges are consistent with the pioneering argument in @xcite and with the relation between lcsft and mst proposed in @xcite .    after observing the analogy between lcsft and mst , we would like to establish the correspondence next . since operators in conformal field theory are characterized by their opes ,",
    "we need to reproduce the opes in terms of lcsft in order to completely confirm the correspondence . in our previous work @xcite",

    "the superscript `` b '' in denotes that we pick up the bosonic sector . on the mst side , of course there is no nonperturbative justification for the bosonic mst , but the interaction term looks natural considering the correct dimension of the operators @xmath51 $ ] and the correspondence between @xmath51(z,\\bar{z})$ ] and @xmath6 .    since the string interaction vertex describes both the processes of one string splitting into two strings and two strings joining into one string , there are two diagrams which correspond to the ope .",
