    "neutron stars with their diversity of astrophysical manifestations provide many challenging problems that make them interesting in their own right .",
    "two aspects of neutron stars , however , make these objects especially important for fundamental physics : ( i ) the high densities prevailing at the core of neutron stars make them possible laboratories for determining the equation of state ( eos ) of the ultimate ground state of cold catalyzed dense matter ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ; see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews ) ; ( ii ) the strong gravitational fields of neutron stars allow them to be used as tools for testing or constraining alternatives @xcite or modifications @xcite of general relativity ( gr ) ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews ) .",
    "neutron stars can not simultaneously be good test beds for both questions ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the often - mentioned notion that neutron stars are excellent labs to constrain the eos presumes that gr is the ultimate theory of gravity at the classical level .",
    "this seems to be a safe assumption given that the parametrized post - newtonian ( ppn ) parameter @xmath1 ( a measure of curvature ) has been tested with a precision of @xmath2 @xcite and found to be consistent with the prediction of gr , @xmath3 .",
    "as argued in the excellent review of psaltis @xcite , however , these solar system tests constrain only weak - field gravity ; gravity in the strong - field regime is largely unconstrained by observations . the differences between gr and its alternatives / modifications can become prominent in the strong gravitational fields of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the mean density of a typical neutron star is @xmath4 g @xmath5 ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) .",
    "this is an order of magnitude higher than the densities probed by nucleon scattering experiments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "at the surface of the star the compactness @xmath8 and `` curvature '' @xmath9  @xmath10 ( see sec . [ sec - method ] for the definition of curvature ) , the two measures of the gravitational field strength @xcite , are 5 and 14 orders of magnitudes larger , respectively , than their counterparts in the solar system ( @xmath11 and @xmath12  @xmath10 ) . this large unconstrained regime in gravity",
    "compared to that in the eos may not immediately imply that a measurement of the mass and/or radius ( m - r ) of a neutron star would constrain gravity models rather than the eos of dense matter : the density of a neutron star is nearly constant at the core and drops by 15 orders of magnitude near the surface meaning that a large fraction of the mass and radius of the neutron star might be determined by the unconstrained eos regime , while the radially increasing compactness and curvature within the star could be in a well - tested regime for most parts of the star .",
    "such an argument is probably the reason for the persistence of the general consent within the astrophysics community that a sufficiently accurate m - r measurement would constrain the eos at the core of neutron stars rather than gravity .",
    "yet another reason could be that gr is singled out among its alternatives as being the simplest valid model of gravity , whereas there is no eos that is equally as prominent . to decide which  gravity or the eos  is better understood , it is necessary to quantify where within the star the strength of gravity is beyond the values probed in solar system tests .    the two future x - ray missions ",
    "nasa s neutron star interior composition explorer ( nicer ) @xcite and esa s the large observatory for x - ray timing ( loft ) @xcite  are expected to measure the mass and radius of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the measurement of the mass and/or radius of a neutron star would constrain the less well known physics input more than the other . whether results from these missions",
    "would constrain the eos or gravity models depends on which of these physics inputs is less well known within neutron stars .",
    "the purpose of this work is to quantify the range of unconstrained gravity within neutron stars in the framework of gr .",
    "this clarifies how much the m - r relations obtained within the framework of gr extrapolate its usage from its well - tested regime . in sec .",
    "[ sec - method ] we present the hydrostatic equilibrium equations and the definitions of the compactness and curvature that we employ . in sec .",
    "[ sec - results ] we present our results showing the radial profiles of the compactness and curvature within the neutron star . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec - discuss ] we discuss our results .",
    "we present the derivations of the curvature scalars in an appendix .",
    "the model for gravity determines the macroscopic hydrostatic equilibrium equations whereas the eos is the microscopic physics input .",
    "the mass and the radius of the star ( the two obvious observables ) are determined by the choice of both the gravity model and the eos . in gr",
    "the hydrostatic equilibrium of a star is described by the tolman - oppenheimer - volkov ( tov ) equations , @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite where @xmath15 is the density , @xmath16 is the pressure , and @xmath17 is the mass within theradial coordinate @xmath18 .",
    "we solved these equations with the boundary conditions @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we employed ap4 @xcite as the eos , @xmath23 . by trying other eoss",
    "we have seen that our conclusions are independent of the choice of eos .",
    "in addition to @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , we calculate the compactness @xmath27 the ricci scalar @xmath28 the full contraction of the ricci tensor @xmath29 , \\label{ricci_tensor}\\ ] ] the full contraction of the riemann tensor ( kretschmann scalar ) @xmath30 - \\frac{16\\kappa   g m \\rho } { r^3 } + \\frac{48 g^2 m^2}{r^6 c^4 } , \\label{k2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the full contraction of the weyl tensor @xmath31 within the star .",
    "the derivations of these curvature scalars for spherically symmetric metric in gr are presented in appendix  [ app1 ] .    which of these curvature scalars should one use as a measure of the curvature within a neutron star ?",
    "it is well known that the components of the ricci tensor @xmath32 and the ricci scalar @xmath33 vanish outside the star .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath32 and @xmath33 in vacuum can also be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ ricci_scalar ] ) and ( [ ricci_tensor ] ) , as they depend only on @xmath34 and @xmath35 which vanish at the surface .",
    "this does not , however , mean that the spacetime of the vacuum as described by the schwarzschild metric is not curved : the riemann tensor has nonvanishing components , e.g.  @xmath36 , in vacuum .",
    "thus the non - vanishing components of the riemann tensor are more suitable measures of the curvature of the spacetime than the ricci scalar and the components of the ricci tensor . instead of dealing with all such components  all of which are at the same order",
    " one can employ the square root of the full contraction of the riemann tensor ( the kretschmann scalar ) @xmath37 , as a measure of the curvature in vacuum .",
    "note that in vacuum this is equal to the square root of the full contraction of the weyl tensor , @xmath38 , as can easily be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ k2 ] ) and ( [ w2 ] ) with @xmath39 and @xmath40 . within the star we employ @xmath41 and @xmath38 as two reasonable measures of the curvature .",
    "they attain different values within the star and approach each other at the crust , becoming identical in vacuum .",
    "in fig .  [ fig - curvature ] we show the radial variation of the curvature scalars @xmath33 , @xmath42 , @xmath41 , and @xmath38 together with the compactness @xmath43 within a neutron star of ( _ a _ ) @xmath44 and ( _ b _ ) @xmath45 .",
    "we have used the ap4 eos @xcite for the core , the nv eos for the inner crust @xcite , and the bps eos for the outer crust @xcite . to obtain a @xmath46 star we employed a central density of @xmath47  g  @xmath5 , which corresponds to a central pressure of @xmath48  dyne  @xmath10 . to obtain a star with @xmath49 we employed @xmath50  g  @xmath5 , which corresponds to @xmath51  dyne  @xmath10 .",
    "we see that at the center of the @xmath46 and @xmath49 stars , @xmath52  @xmath10 and @xmath53  @xmath10 , respectively and @xmath41 decreases only a few times towards the surface , remaining 15 orders of magnitude larger than @xmath54 .",
    "if one uses @xmath41 as a measure of curvature one would immediately be drawn to the conclusion that gr is in a less tested regime than eos over the entire star . in order to give the eos uncertainty a `` chance '' to exceed that of gravity ( at least at the inner parts of the star ) we choose the square root of the full contraction of the weyl tensor @xmath38which vanishes at the center and increases towards the surface  as a measure of the curvature .         in fig .",
    "[ fig - curv_log ] we show the radial variation , on a logarithmic scale , of the square root of the full contraction of the weyl tensor @xmath38 and compactness @xmath43 within a neutron star of ( _ a _ ) @xmath44 and ( _ b _ ) @xmath45 , obtained again with the ap4 eos .",
    "we see that the `` compactness '' @xmath43 is above the value probed in solar system tests ( @xmath55 ) for @xmath56  m and increases as a power law to reach @xmath57 at the crust .",
    "even more remarkable is the `` curvature '' @xmath38 which goes beyond @xmath58  @xmath10 for @xmath59  mm and increases as a power law ( @xmath60 ) for a large part of the star ( see appendix [ app2 ] ) . as a result",
    "the curvature @xmath38 is also several orders of magnitude larger throughout almost the entire star than the values in the solar system at which gr is tested .",
    "our results demonstrate that the strength of gravity within a neutron star is orders of magnitude larger than the gravitational strengths probed in solar system tests , indicating that the presupposition of the validity of gr in determining the neutron star structure is an `` extravagant '' extrapolation .",
    "the eos , on the other hand , is only an order of magnitude larger than what is being probed in nucleon scattering experiments .",
    "this does not only imply that an m - r measurement would constrain gravity models more than eos models , but also that  given that eoss produce very different m - r relations  it would not be possible to investigate deviations from gr by any measurement of m - r unless the eos is fully constrained by earth - based experiments . the strong gravity of neutron stars , nevertheless , might allow one to constrain modified gravity models in a perturbative approach ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    our results are consistent with that of dedeo and psaltis @xcite , where the authors showed that m - r relations obtained by different models of gravity show a much greater variance than m - r relations obtained with different eoss .",
    "our results complement those of dedeo and psaltis @xcite by quantifying the strength of gravity _ within _ the neutron stars and clarifies the fact that the domain where gravity is in a not - well - tested regime largely overlaps with the domain where the eos is not constrained .    our results for",
    "the domain of tested validity obviously depend on the gravity model chosen , i.e. , gr . the analysis we provide can be repeated for different viable gravity models with parameters constrained by solar system tests .",
    "though such a systematic survey is beyond the scope of this paper , the present constraints on the mass and radius taken roughly as @xmath61 and @xmath62  km , already lead to a very large compactness and curvature at the surface .",
    "these values obtained via phenomena outside the neutron star can be taken to be independent of the gravity model employed because almost all models of gravity yield the same vacuum solutions obtained with gr @xcite .",
    "it then seems obvious that in any gravity model the curvature and compactness within the neutron star should increase radially from zero to values that are orders of magnitude larger than those probed in the solar system tests .",
    "hence any model of gravity when employed for the structure of neutron stars would actually be extrapolated from its domain of tested validity .",
    "a systematic stretching of gr beyond its regime of tested validity by several orders of magnitude naturally raises the question of whether there is any bias in the historical development of eoss , i.e. , whether they have evolved towards producing reasonable m - r relations when used within the framework of gr .",
    "such a question becomes more significant given that astrophysical measurements @xcite , except for that of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , yield radii systematically smaller than that implied by the lead radius experiment ( prex ) @xcite within the framework of gr @xcite .",
    "gr sets a maximum mass @xmath63 for neutron stars @xcite with a different value for each eos ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "the `` two solar mass '' pulsars psr j1614@xmath642230 @xcite and psr j0348@xmath650432 @xcite suggest that @xmath66 . the statistical analysis of kiziltan _",
    "et al_.  @xcite further suggests that the distribution of masses of neutron stars in nature are not cut off at the upper end such that stellar evolution could produce a low number of @xmath67 neutron stars . within gr",
    "this favors stiff eoss that to yield maximum allowable masses of neutron stars larger than 2.5 solar masses .",
    "it is hard to reconcile this result with the small measured radii that favor soft eoss within gr .",
    "this may signal deviations from gr in strong gravity unless there are systematic errors of order 30% in the radius measurements .",
    "we are yet unaware of any gravity model that yields 2.5 solar - mass objects with 9 - 11  km with the present eoss that is also consistent with the solar system tests .",
    "recently , arapolu _",
    "et al_. @xcite showed within an @xmath68 gravity model that the maximum mass of neutron stars becomes larger for smaller values of @xmath69 , while the radius remains nearly constant .",
    "this model of gravity then gives large - mass objects for @xmath70 even with soft eoss .",
    "the nonrelativistic limit of such a gravity model , however , requires @xmath71 @xcite , rendering solutions with @xmath72 nonphysical .",
    "both the compactness and the curvature reach their maximum values near the crust . considering that the eos of the crust is fairly well known @xcite , we are led to the conclusion that the crust of neutron stars provides the best sites in the universe for identifying deviations from gr in strong gravity .",
    "such phenomena displayed by the crust are , e.g. , the glitch activity of young pulsars @xcite and modulation of the cooling of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "one may then expect deviations from gr to be identified from , e.g. ,  the glitch activity of pulsars given that gr is the least constrained physics input in the description of the phenomena by 14 orders of magnitude in curvature and 5 orders of magnitude in compactness , according to fig .",
    "[ fig - curv_log ] .",
    "such a deviation from gr may already have been observed ! the recent inference @xcite that the moment of inertia of the crust of neutron stars is not sufficient to understand some of the glitch activity through the highly successful vortex creep model @xcite may signal a deviation from gr in strong gravity rather than a requirement for the modification of the model itself .",
    "an investigation of the effect of scalar fields @xcite on the moment of inertia of neutron stars is left for a future work .    * acknowledgements *    we acknowledge support from the scientific and technological council of turkey ( tbitak ) with the project number 112t105 .",
