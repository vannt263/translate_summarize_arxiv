    "what is the origin of the radio emission in radio quiet ( rq ) agn ? in radio loud ( rl ) agn the radio emission is often spatially resolved with a jet like structure , which on milli - arcsec ( hereafter mas ) scales often shows super luminal motion indicative of bulk relativistic motion . in radio quiet agn @xcite , a significant fraction of the radio emission is often unresolved @xcite , even on pc scale @xcite .",
    "the observed spectral slopes are often flat , or even inverted @xcite , which indicates the emission is not just optically thin synchrotron emission , but rather includes some contribution from a compact optically thick source , which can produce a flat or inverted spectrum",
    ".    some of the radio emission in rq agn may be produced by starburst activity in the host galaxy @xcite , however the bulk of the radio emission likely originates in the agn activity @xcite .",
    "the radio emission may be spatially extended if it originates in an agn driven wind which shocks the host galaxy gas @xcite .",
    "the radio may also originate from a scaled down compact jet emission , where the typical jet power is @xmath4 smaller than in rl agn @xcite .",
    "observations of nearby rq seyfert galaxies resolve the emission @xcite , and show sub relativistic motion on pc scale @xcite .",
    "indications for a compact pc scale source size are also given by variability @xcite .",
    "laor & behar ( 2008 , hereafter lb08 ) , noted that rq agn follow the gudel - benz relation , where @xmath5 , which coronally active stars follow .",
    "since the x - ray emission in rq agn may originate in a corona above the accretion disc , it is natural to assume that the radio emission in rq agn may also originate in the corona , as it does in coronally active stars .",
    "although the physical mechanism which leads to the gudel - benz relation is not understood yet , and the luminosities associated with agn and coronally active stars deviate by about 13 orders of magnitude ( @xmath6 vs. @xmath7erg  s@xmath8 ) , the local coronal conditions may be similar ( effective temperature , large rotational shear , local densities , see discussion in gudel 2002 ) .",
    "so , it is plausible to expect that similar mechanisms operate in both systems .",
    "the maximal possible synchrotron surface emissivity ( i.e. brightness temperature ) implies that the minimal size of the ghz emission region is on parsec scales ( e.g. lb08 , eq.22 there ) , as also suggested by the observed variability @xcite .",
    "relativistic electrons may reach this radius through the equivalent of coronal mass ejections ( cme ) observed in coronally active stars , i.e. magnetized plasma ejected from the innermost accretion disc .",
    "alternatively , the electrons may reside in a corona which forms a thin layer above an accretion disc , which extends out to pc scale .",
    "although the disc on pc scale must be cold , it may still have a surface corona , as also seen in cool m stars which are sometimes coronally active @xcite .",
    "synchrotron emission on pc scale , or smaller , may also be produced by a scaled down , low power , jet emission .",
    "the difference between a cme and jetted emission is more on the descriptive level , where cme is likely to be poorly collimated and form a sub relativistic outflow , while the term jet is used for a collimated relativistic outflow .",
    "some relativistic jet models in rl agn invoke a disc corona as the base of the jet @xcite , and in rq agn the subsequent acceleration may be missing .",
    "interestingly , high resolution pc scale imaging of ngc  1068 reveal radio emission aligned with the central obscuring torus @xcite , which provides support for the coronal disc emission scenario for the pc scale radio emission .",
    "however , such a pc scale radio emitting corona is clearly not the dominant source of the x - ray emission in unobscured agn , given the observed x - ray variability on time scales of days or shorter .",
    "the observed x - ray emission must come from the innermost accreting region , possibly from an x - ray emitting corona above the innermost disc at a few gravitational radii . given the maximal intensity of synchrotron emission ,",
    "the radio emitting corona should be @xmath9 times larger than the x - ray emitting corona .",
    "however , since the minimal size of the synchrotron emission region scales as @xmath10 ( lb08 ) , the radio emission at a few hundred ghz can come directly from the x - ray corona @xcite .",
    "vlbi observations @xcite yield lower limits on the brightness temperature of @xmath11  k. although the synchrotron emission is commonly assumed to originate in relativistic electrons with a power - law energy distribution , this limit on @xmath12 is also consistent with synchrotron emission of thermal electrons in the radio corona , for a corona temperature of @xmath13  k , as measured for the x - ray corona @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to calculate the possible range of the radio emission signatures of coronal synchrotron models .",
    "these predictions can be used to explore the validity of the coronal emission scenario , and to possibly probe the physical parameters of the corona . in section 2",
    "we describe the theoretical background , in section 3 the numerical solution scheme , in section 4 we provide useful analytic solution , and in section 5 we present the numerical solution .",
    "the discussion is given in section 6 , and the conclusions are summarized in section 7 . in paper ii",
    "( raginski & laor , in preparation ) we calculate the implied x - ray emission of the coronal models used here , and discuss the additional constraints provided by the x - ray observations .",
    "electrons accelerate and radiate radio emission either when they pass near charged particle , or when they propagate in a magnetic field . in the earlier case ,",
    "the free - free spectral slope @xmath14 is @xmath15 from the radio to @xmath16 .",
    "the thermal free - free emission is not viable in objects with a power - law emission with a steeper of a flatter @xmath17 .",
    "free - free emission of @xmath18  k gas is also excluded as it over predicts the observed x - ray luminosity ( e.g. lb08 , section 3.6.1 there ) .",
    "free - free is a viable mechanism if the gas is cooler than @xmath19k , but this is generally ruled out by the vlbi limits of @xmath11  k on the core emission .",
    "thus , electrons in a magnetic field is the only generally viable mechanism .",
    "below we briefly review the emission of relativistic electrons with a power - law ( pl ) energy distribution ( synchrotron emission ) , thermal electrons ( cyclotron emission ) , or mildly relativistic thermal electrons ( cyclo - synchrotron emission , hereafter thermal synchrotron emission ) .",
    "we provide expressions for the emission , absorption , and radiation transfer used to derive the observed emission .",
    "an electron in a magnetic field @xmath20 gyrates around the field lines at a frequency @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the electron charge , @xmath23 is the mass of the electron , @xmath24 is the lorentz factor , and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the velocity of the electron .",
    "non relativistic electrons ( @xmath27 ) radiate cyclotron emission at @xmath28 . for mildly relativistic electrons ( @xmath29 ) , additional harmonics appear and the emitted spectrum becomes polychromatic with a few additional lines at higher harmonics . as the electrons become more relativistic ( @xmath30 ) , higher harmonics appear . the width of each line becomes wider with increasing harmonic number , and finally for high enough value of @xmath31 and harmonic number @xmath32 , adjacent harmonics merge and a continuous spectrum is generated .",
    "the resonant frequencies occur at @xcite .",
    "@xmath33 where @xmath34 is the projection of @xmath35 on the direction of the magnetic field , and @xmath36 is the angle between the magnetic field and the observer .",
    "the pitch angle @xmath37 is the angle between the direction of motion of the electron and the magnetic field , which gives @xmath38 equation [ eq : omega_s ] is correct when the refraction index of the medium is unity , which is a good approximation for agn coronae , as the frequencies of interest are well above the gyration and langmuir frequencies ( @xmath39 for typical condition assumed ) .",
    "we have verified this numerically by solving for the emission spectrum including the corona refractive index .",
    "we used zheleznyakov ( 1970 , eqs .",
    "26 & 35 there ) for the emitted energy per harmonic number per solid angle ( erg  sec@xmath8  strd@xmath8 ) .",

    "we then integrate over @xmath37 , and @xmath36 , by assuming a uniform distribution in both angles , i.e. a random distribution of both the electron velocities and the magnetic field line directions in a given volume ,    @xmath52    in units of erg  sec@xmath8  @xmath53  hz@xmath8 , where @xmath54 is the emission of a single electron .",

    "we modify the equation to include the dependence on pitch angle @xmath37 , which gives @xmath57 where e is the kinetic energy of the electron , and @xmath58 is the density of electrons per unit energy per pitch angle .",
    "to calculate the radiative transfer we divide the medium into @xmath59 unit volumes ( see below the assumed geometry ) of uniform emission and absorption coefficients , say @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "if a ray with an intensity @xmath62 enters this unit volume , and travels a distance of @xmath63 within this volume , then the intensity of the exiting ray is @xmath64 where the first term represents the absorption of the incident intensity , and the second one is the contribution of the emission inside the volume .",

    "we explore the dependence of the radio spectrum on the value of @xmath79 .",
    "in addition to the thermal electrons , we assume that the corona also has non thermal electrons with a pl energy distribution .",

    "the radio emitting shock fronts are expected to be on tens to a hundred pc scales @xcite , and possibly out to kpc scale @xcite . in contrast , the spherical coronal models explored here are much more compact , and produce the observed luminosity on a scale of a single pc .",
    "spatially , the wind interaction region may be resolved on vlbi mas scale imaging , which should show emission from the shock front surface .",
    "in contrast , a magnetized cme may produce synchrotron from the whole volume .",
    "however , the later case will be resolved only in nearby agn ( closer than 200  mpc , for a 1  mas resolution ) .",
    "a major difference , which results from the different physical sizes , is the spectral slope .",
    "the size in the wind scenario suggests that the synchrotron emission will be optically thick only at frequencies well below a ghz ( lb08 ) , and will therefore be optically thin with @xmath315 at 1 - 100  ghz ( unless the emission is highly clumped ) . in the cme case , @xmath316 is possible , where the exact value depends on the radial density and temperature distributions ( see eqs.63 , 66 ) .",
    "as noted above , about half of the rq agn are characterized by @xmath317 , which argues strongly against the wind scenario in these objects .",
    "if the wind scenarios apply , the observed radio emission should not vary on timescales of a few years or shorter , while the compact coronal models allow variability on timescales of a year and faster . as noted above",
    ", the observations suggest significant variability on timescales of months and below in some of the rq agn , which clearly rules out the wind scenario as the dominant mechanism in these objects .",
    "furthermore , if the spectral slope is flat , then the observed emission is a superposition of optically thick sources with a range of sizes , and the variability timescale is expected to decrease with increasing frequency , as possibly observed in ngc  7469 @xcite .",
    "is the thermal synchrotron a viable solution ?",
    "here we find that the thermal synchrotron from an isothermal corona with @xmath318  k , as suggested by recent hard x - ray observations @xcite , is a factor of @xmath319 lower than the emission of pl electrons , for similar model parameters ( see fig.8 ) .",
    "thermal synchrotron can reach the observed luminosities assuming a higher temperatures .",
    "since the thermal synchrotron follows @xmath320 ( section [ sec : radio_parameters ] ) , a value of @xmath321  k is required for the thermal synchrotron to reach the synchrotron emissivity .",

    "such a high value for @xmath91 appears to be excluded by x - ray observations ( though these apply to the x - ray corona , rather than the much larger radio corona at a few ghz ) .",
    "such a high temperature is not expected from magnetic reconnection , and may also be excluded by pair production arguments , as discussed above ( section 1 ) .",
    "alternatively , thermal synchrotron from a @xmath318  k corona may still be viable , if the emitting surface is significantly larger . as noted above ,",
    "current vlbi observations lead to minimal brightness temperatures @xmath329  k , and therefore do not exclude such thermal synchrotron .",
    "the signature of thermal synchrotron is an exponential cutoff in the emission above a few hundred ghz , where the most compact emitting region becomes optically thin ( eq.36 ) .",
    "this results from the exponential cutoff in the maximal electron energy density in the relativistic maxwell boltzmann distribution ( eq.14 ) .",
    "this is in contrast with the pl distribution , where the a maximal @xmath330 assumed here , ensures the peak emission is beyond 1000  ghz ( section 3 ) .",
    "if there is a break in the pl electron energy distribution , it will also be associated by a corresponding spectral break at @xmath102  mhz ( in the optically thin case ) .",
    "however , the break will be to a steeper pl emission , rather than the sharp exponential break of the thermal synchrotron .",
    "is a thin corona at @xmath318k , which extends out to say @xmath331 , ( 3  pc in our model ) a viable solution ? this temperature is likely well above the escape speed from the disc surface at such a large radius .",
    "therefore , the corona needs to be magnetically confined to avoid a thermal wind with a considerable mass loss .",
    "the assumed equipartition magnetic field strength is consistent with the value required by the magnetic confinement assumption .",
    "since the system is powered by accretion , can accretion provide enough energy to power the radio emission ?",

    "whether it can indeed maintain a thin magnetically confined hot corona at its surface is an open question .",
    "alternatively , and maybe more plausibly , the corona is in a spherical configuration .",
    "although the solution here is assumed static , such a configuration is likely formed by an outflow , i.e. a cme produced by coronal activity in the inner disc . in this case",
    "there is no need to confine the coronal gas , and its power may come from the energy embedded in it when it is ejected .",
    "interestingly , a flat spectral slope is obtained for @xmath261 , as expected in a uniform velocity outflow ( the likely wind solution at large radius ) . the coronal energy density required to get the observed @xmath339  erg  s@xmath8  hz@xmath8 is @xmath340  erg  @xmath53 ( fig.7 , upper right panel ) at @xmath94 .",
    "since it scales at @xmath341 , the ratio to the radiation energy density of the agn @xmath342 remains constant . for @xmath343  erg  s@xmath8 , which corresponds to the above @xmath140 at @xmath344  ghz",
    ", one gets @xmath345 .",
    "the corona is therefore a dynamically negligible component .",
    "this constant ratio is interesting , and may provide some hints for the coronal heating mechanism .",
    "we explore the possible radio emission from either a flat or a spherical magnetized corona , powered by either pl or thermal electrons .",
    "we concentrate on flat spectra models , which characterize about half of rq agn , and is the main signature of a compact emission region such as a corona .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :    \\1 .",
    "a flat spectral slope in the 1 - 1000 ghz range requires the superposition of synchrotron emission from the innermost region at @xmath298 to @xmath331 ( @xmath346  pc to 3  pc ) .",
    "the radio corona at 1  ghz emission comes from the largest scales , and should be resolved in mas resolution vlbi observations of nearby agn ( closer than @xmath347  mpc ) , the few 100  ghz emission corona overlaps in size the x - ray corona , and its size can only be constrained from its variability timescale .",
    "\\2 . the synchrotron emission at a given frequency ,",
    "is produced over a wide range of radii for pl electrons .",
    "in contrast , the synchrotron emission of thermal electrons at a given frequency , originates from a narrow range of radii .",
    "the synchrotron emission from a disc corona of pl electrons is nearly isotropic , as most of the emission originates from the optically thin outer regions .",
    "the emission of thermal electrons from a disc corona shows a @xmath348 dependence , as the observed emission is dominated by the outermost optically thick region .",
    "a luminosity of @xmath339  erg  s@xmath8  hz@xmath8 can be produced by pl electrons , magnetic field , and a corona , which are all in equipartition , with an energy density which scales roughly as @xmath349 , and @xmath350  erg  @xmath53 at @xmath298 . in the spherical corona configuration , the energy density scales as @xmath341 .",
    "for pl electrons synchrotron , this equipartition energy density is a constant fraction of @xmath2 of the central source radiation density .",
    "thermal synchrotron from @xmath318  k electrons , as suggested by recent hard x - ray observations , under predicts the radio @xmath140 by a factor of @xmath319 . to be a valid mechanism the emitting surface must be significantly larger than assumed here , but",
    "it is not yet in contradiction with current vlbi observations .",
    "alternatively , one needs @xmath321  k to derive the observed luminosity at @xmath344  ghz .    \\6 . at @xmath351 - 1000",
    "ghz the innermost corona is expected to become optically thin , and the spectrum is expected to show a spectral break . the position of this break can be used to probe the innermost coronal size .",
    "it should display a sharp cutoff , rather than a steeper pl , in case of thermal synchrotron emission .",
    "since dust heavily dominates this spectral range , the detection requires vlbi observations , which exclude the low @xmath352 dust emission .",
    "additional constraints on the radio and x - ray coronal properties can be derived by including the observed x - ray emission , in particular the enigmatic gudel - benz relation of @xmath353 , which is explored in paper ii    clearly , further exploration of the radio emission in rq agn , in particular at the mm range @xcite , will allow to probe directly the distribution of relativistic electrons and magnetic fields closest to the centre .",
    "the relation of the mm emission with the x - ray emission , in particular their variabilities @xcite , can provide important insights for the physical mechanisms which power accretion disc coronae in rq agn .",
