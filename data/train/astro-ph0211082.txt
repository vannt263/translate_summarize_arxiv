    "protostars are young stellar objects that are still in the process of accreting the bulk of material , and with most of their luminosity being derived from the infall of matter .",
    "class i young stellar objects @xcite have been viewed as protostellar candidates @xcite , but sub - mm work showed that many class i objects have lower mass envelopes than expected , suggesting that these class i objects may have already depleted their surrounding envelopes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "class 0 sources were identified by @xcite as sources that are more deeply embedded and associated with more powerful outflows than `` standard '' class i young stellar objects .",
    "consequently , the class 0 sources have been proposed as the evolutionary precursors to the class i protostars @xcite .",
    "work by @xcite and @xcite suggested a direct evolutionary sequence from the class 0 stage to the class i stage , with the class 0 sources representing the youngest protostars .",
    "observationally , the defining characteristics of the class 0 sources are 1 ) a submillimeter - to - bolometric luminosity ratio of @xmath5 , 2 ) invisibility at near - infrared wavelengths , 3 ) a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) described by a single - temperature ( modified ) blackbody with a bolometric temperature of @xmath6 k , and 4 ) the presence of a molecular outflow @xcite .",
    "however , recently @xcite have argued that class 0 protostars are located preferentially in higher density regions and that class i young stellar objects are located preferentially in lower density regions and may be of comparable evolution .",
    "thus , the class 0 and class i sources may not represent a true evolutionary sequence . to further complicate the distinction between class 0 and class i objects , some class i objects , which are viewed at high inclination ,",
    "may appear `` class 0-like '' because of the high optical depth associated with viewing the disk around class i sources ( nearly ) edge - on @xcite .    to help address these issues",
    ", it would be instructive to study a set of young stellar objects believed to be coeval and located within the same environment , thus removing the possible ambiguity of differing initial conditions .",
    "the binary system l1448n - irs3 may provide such a useful comparison .    l1448 is a globule located within the perseus molecular cloud complex ( @xmath7 pc ) containing an extremely young and highly collimated bipolar outflow @xcite .",
    "the exciting source ( l1448-mm ) of the bipolar outflow was identified by @xcite , and has been classified as a class 0 protostar . located in the northwest portion of the bipolar outflow",
    "is the infrared source l1448n - irs3 , which is powering its own molecular outflow @xcite .",
    "l1448n - irs3 consists of three sources which have been resolved at mm wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and are known as l1448n - irs3(a ) , l1448n - irs3(b ) , and l1448n - irs3(c ) .",
    "l1448n - irs3(c ) , also known as l1448nw , is located @xmath820  northwest of irs3(a , b ) , and is not considered in this paper .",
    "irs3(a ) and irs3(b ) are separated by @xmath9 ( 2100 au ) and are considered a coeval , protostellar binary system with a common envelope @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the strong bipolar outflow from l1448-mm may have induced the star formation associated with l1448n - irs3 @xcite .    taken together , the irs3(a , b ) binary meets each of the observational requirements for a class 0 protostar : 1 ) @xmath10 @xcite ; 2 ) neither of the sources has been detected at k to a limit of 18th magnitude @xcite ; 3 ) the mm sed is characterized by a temperature of 22.5 k @xcite ; and 4 ) there is a molecular outflow associated with the system @xcite .",
    "detailed modeling of irs3(a , b ) has been performed on the binary as a whole ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and consequently , the relative evolutionary status of the individual components of irs3 remains undetermined .",
    "there are differences between the two sources . at 2.7 mm , irs3(b )",
    "is the stronger source ( @xmath11 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while at 2 and 6 cm , irs3(a ) dominates the emission ( @xmath12 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the derived envelope masses from the resolved ( optically thin ) mm data are  0.09 m@xmath13 and  0.52 m@xmath13 , for irs3(a ) and irs3(b ) , respectively .",
    "while both sources are apparently associated with outflows @xcite , only irs3(b ) displays signatures of mass infall , suggesting that irs3(a ) may have accumulated most of its envelope mass @xcite .",
    "the two sources remain unresolved for all other observations ( mm wavelengths @xmath14 mm ; @xcite , and iras infrared wavelengths ; @xcite ) .",
    "the binary system has a combined bolometric luminosity of @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite note that the iras infrared emission appears in excess of that expected from the single - temperature blackbody fit to the mm data , and they attribute the excess to shock - heated dust associated with the outflows .",
    "millimeter wavelengths are most sensitive to the cool outer envelopes surrounding protostars .",
    "complementary to mm observations , mid - infrared observations probe the inner regions of accretion near , or at , the central protostar and are expected to have only a minor contribution from the outer envelope .",
    "thus , observations at @xmath0  provide a means of comparing the central protostar to the outer envelope .",
    "the iras observations do not spatially resolve the components of irs3 @xcite .",
    "so while irs3(a , b ) is relatively bright at mid - infrared wavelengths ( @xmath16 jy , @xmath17 jy ) , it is unclear how the mid - infrared emission is distributed among the two sources and the envelope .    in order to disentangle the mid - infrared emissions from irs3(a ) , irs3(b ) , and the envelope , and to clarify the evolutionary status of the sources , we present mid - infrared ( @xmath0 ) high - angular - resolution ( @xmath18 ) observations of the protostellar binary system .",
    "only irs3(a ) was detected ; upper limits for the mid - infrared emission of irs3(b ) are discussed .",
    "we calculate regional and bolometric luminosities , and estimate the central and envelope masses .",
    "we conclude with a brief discussion of the evolutionary status of the sources .",
    "observations of irs3 were made on 05 december 2000 ut using the university of florida mid - infrared camera oscir on the gemini - north 8  m telescope .",
    "oscir utilizes a @xmath19 si : as blocked impurity band detector , with a pixel scale of @xmath20 per pixel and a field of view of @xmath21 on the gemini - north telescope .",
    "irs3 was observed in four filter passbands ( n , ihw18 , q3 , & h25 ) using a standard chop - nod sequence with a 30  chop throw in declination .",
    "the weather was mostly clear with some high cirrus and typical seeing of @xmath22 .",
    "a summary of the filters , frametimes , total integration time per filter , and associated airmasses is given in table 1 .",
    "to ensure accurate pointing , the telescope was first centered on the optical guide star located @xmath85  from irs3 , and the telescope was offset to a position located directly between irs3(a ) and irs3(b ) .",
    "the initial source acquisition was made with the h25 filter ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the flux calibration was obtained by observing @xmath24 and just prior to the science observations and @xmath25 tau just after the science observations .",
    "irs3(a ) was immediately apparent in the real - time oscir data acquisition quick - look display . to remove the possibility of pointing errors and ambiguity of the identity of the detected source , the offset pointing was confirmed and a three - position mosaic was made with the h25 filter , with 5  steps to the northwest .",
    "no detection of irs3(b ) or any other source was made .",
    "the data were reduced with custom - written idl routines for the oscir data format .",
    "the images were smoothed with an @xmath26 gaussian , and standard aperture photometry was performed on the final reduced co - added frames using an idl version of phot , with an aperture diameter of @xmath27 .",
    "the h25 ( 24 ) mosaic is presented in figure 1 .",
    "the primary result , as indicated by figure 1 , is that _ all _ of the mid - infrared flux observed from l1448n - irs3 emanates from irs3(a ) .",
    "all of the detected flux arises within a region of diameter @xmath27 ; i.e. , the mid - infrared emission comes from a region located _ no farther _ than @xmath28 au , in projection , from the central source .",
    "@xcite argued that the infrared emission ( 12 & 25 ) , in excess of the envelope contribution , may be the result of shock - heated dust resulting from interactions between the local dust and the outflows .",
    "no mid - infrared emission is observed toward irs3(b ) , which powers its own outflow , or in the general environment , suggesting that the mid - infrared emission of irs3 is associated entirely with the accretion emission of irs3(a ) .",
    "figure 1 does show a hint of extended structure at 24  which is perpendicular to the direction of the h@xmath29 outflow emission from irs3 @xcite , perhaps suggestive of the accretion structure around irs3(a ) .",
    "the other mid - infrared images were searched for evidence of this structure , and nothing conclusive was found .",
    "however , the integration time for the 24  image is 3 times longer than the integrations times in other filters . at present",
    ", it is unclear if the observed structure is real .",
    "the photometry for irs3(a ) is presented in table 2 , and is in agreement with the iras hires flux densities reported in @xcite . while irs3(b )",
    "was not detected , 3@xmath30 upper limits were calculated based upon the statistical uncertainties of photometry for irs3(a ) .",
    "in addition to the oscir data presented here , the iso database was searched , and a 14  isocam image was extracted .",
    "iso clearly detected irs3 , but did not resolve the two sources .",
    "here we assume that the iso 14  emission is contributed solely by irs3(a ) , as is the case for our mid - infrared photometry .",
    "using a 20  aperture , the 14  flux density is measured to be @xmath31 jy .",
    "the oscir and iso mid - infrared sed of irs3(a ) is displayed in figure 2 .",
    "to understand the temperatures associated with the mid - infrared emission , a single temperature blackbody was fitted to the dataset .",
    "a @xmath32 k blackbody characterizes the overall @xmath0  colors , but is generally a poor fit to the dataset with a @xmath33 . in the sed plot ( fig .",
    "2 ) , the @xmath34 k blackbody curve is shown , and it clearly does not represent accurately the distribution of the mid - infrared fluxes .    if the blackbody fitting is restricted to the @xmath35 data , a single temperature @xmath36 k blackbody fits the longer wavelength data very well ( @xmath37 ) , but significantly underestimates the 10 & 14  fluxes ( see fig .",
    "we also considered a single - temperature modified blackbody function of the form @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the planck function , @xmath40 is the optical depth with a @xmath41 dependency , and @xmath42 is the solid angle .",
    "however , we did not find a reasonable fit to the dataset . in order to parameterize",
    "the observations , multiple source temperatures are necessary .",
    "a two temperature blackbody function of the form @xmath43 $ ] , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the blackbody temperatures , @xmath46 is the scaling factor , and @xmath47 is the fractional contribution of the primary blackbody component , was fitted to the mid - infrared data . in general , the scaling factor @xmath46 is a multiplicative combination of the source solid angle and the radiative transfer function @xmath48 .",
    "the relative contributions @xmath47 and @xmath49 may represent source size and/or optical depth differences . as a final caveat , the broad n - band 10  filter and the iso 14  filter span the silicate feature . without narrow - band photometry or low - resolution spectroscopy , it is not possible to determine how the silicate feature contaminates the photometry .",
    "since the silicate feature , if present , is likely to be in absorption for such young and highly embedded sources , the 10 and 14  fluxes may underestimate the overall mid - infrared continuum level .    the best fit parameters for the dual - blackbody model consist of two distinct temperatures of @xmath50 k and @xmath51 k with relative contributions of @xmath52% and @xmath53% , and a scale factor of @xmath54 .",
    "the resultant reduced chi - square is @xmath55 .",
    "the summed curve and the individual components of the fit are shown in fig .",
    "a two temperature blackbody model is obviously simplistic given that the temperature distribution is likely to be continuous with , for example , a radial powerlaw fall - off of the form @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "however , it does characterize the emission and emphasizes the regions from where the mid - infrared emission arises .",
    "dust temperatures of @xmath57 k are located at radii of @xmath58 au ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , consistent with the @xmath59 ( @xmath60 au ) source size of irs3(a ) ( fig .",
    ", the mid - infrared observations are probing directly the zone of accretion near , or at , the central protostar .",
    "the detected mid - infrared radiation provides a means of estimating the central accretion luminosity .",
    "summing over the dual blackbody curve from @xmath61 , we estimate the mid - infrared luminosity to be @xmath62 .",
    "if all the mid - infrared luminosity is a result of gravitational infall , then we can estimate a central source mass from the relation @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the mass infall rate , @xmath65 is the source size , and @xmath66 is the source mass . using a standard @xmath67 protostellar radius @xcite and typical mass accretion rates of @xmath68 @xcite , we estimate the central mass to be @xmath69 .      at @xmath70 mm , irs3(a ) and irs3(b ) have been spatially resolved as two distinct sources , but with a common envelope @xcite .",
    "the 2.7 mm flux densities , integrated over @xmath71 boxes , for irs3(a ) and irs3(b ) are @xmath72 jy and @xmath73 jy , respectively . at far - infrared wavelengths ,",
    "the binary remains unresolved , with iras flux densities of @xmath74 jy and @xmath75 jy @xcite . in figure 3 , we present the overall spectral energy distribution of irs3(a ) .",
    "the modified blackbody fit to the irs3(a , b ) common envelope @xcite , scaled to the 2.7 mm flux of irs3(a ) , is shown in figure 3 .",
    "the cold ( @xmath76 k ) blackbody fit to the envelope clearly does not predict the observed mid - infrared luminosity . unlike the prototypical class",
    "0 sources ( e.g. , vla 1623 ) , the cold envelope emission does not dominate the overall sed of irs3(a ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    using spherical infalling envelope models @xcite , the envelope mass and bolometric luminosity of irs3(a ) can be estimated .",
    "the models ( provided courtesy n. calvet ) have a density at @xmath77 au of @xmath78 g @xmath79 , corresponding to an envelope infall rate of @xmath80",
    ". models with centrifugal radii of @xmath81 au and 150 au were tested .",
    "the centrifugal radius @xmath82 represents the radius at which the spherical envelope departs from free - fall ( @xmath83 ) as material falls onto the disk ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "the models have an inclination of @xmath85 and a luminosity of 1 @xmath86 .",
    "a factor of 1.6 was needed to scale the models to the 2.7 mm flux , indicating that irs3(a ) is more luminous than 1 @xmath86 ( in agreement with the measured @xmath87 ) .",
    "the model seds are shown in figure 3 .    the shape of the model sed and the depth of the silicate features are dependent upon the source luminosity , density , centrifugal radius , and source inclination .",
    "detailed modeling of the sed can not provide a unique solution without a much more complete sed for irs3(a ) .",
    "however , representative models can qualitatively parameterize the luminosity and the density of the protostar .",
    "a model with @xmath88 g @xmath79 and @xmath89 m@xmath90 provides a reasonable fit to the overall sed of irs3(a ) ( see figure 3 ) . for this particular model density ( @xmath91 ) , the model with the smaller centrifugal radius ( 50 au ) best describes the data .",
    "if the density @xmath91 is decreased by an order of magnitude , then the models predict an infrared luminosity @xmath92 times larger than that observed .",
    "if the density is increased by an order of magnitude , the models predict an infrared luminosity @xmath92 times lower than that observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these model densities and infall rates are more like those associated with the models for class i protostars such as l1551-irs5 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite found that the true class 0 sources ( vla 1623 & hh24 mms ) require models with infall rates an order of magnitude higher than required for irs3(a ) .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of irs3(a ) , estimated from the luminosity of the scaled infall model , is @xmath93 , and the submm luminosity ( @xmath94 ) is @xmath95 .",
    "thus , @xmath96% is below the observational minimum for a class 0 protostar .",
    "the model envelope mass ( @xmath97 ) is @xmath98 .",
    "finally , the modeling suggests that the majority , if not all , of the far - infrared emission of irs3(a , b ) is also produced by irs3(a ) .      a key goal of the sed analyses is to clarify the evolutionary status of the irs3 components .",
    "class 0 to class i evolution is characterized by the transition from @xmath99 to @xmath100 .",
    "the envelope mass for irs3(a ) was found to be @xmath101 , and depending upon the assumed infall rate @xmath102 , the irs3(a ) central source mass is estimated to be @xmath103 .",
    "thus , the envelope and central star masses are comparable to each other .",
    "@xcite established an empirical diagnostic @xmath104 diagram that appears to naturally separate confirmed class 0 sources from confirmed class i sources ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we have reproduced that diagram here ( figure 4 ) and have indicated the position of irs3(a ) .",
    "the minimum @xmath105 is from the mid - infrared luminosity estimate ( 1.3 @xmath86 ) and the maximum is from the scaled infall model ( 1.6 @xmath86 ) .",
    "irs3(a ) falls squarely within the midst of the confirmed class i objects , and is fully separated from the class 0 protostars .",
    "the position of irs3(a ) in the @xmath4 diagram , combined with the relative mass estimates from above , suggests that irs3(a ) may be more evolved than a class 0 protostar .",
    "this may also explain why infall appears associated with irs3(b ) and not irs3(a ) @xcite .",
    "the fact that irs3(a ) is invisible at near - infrared wavelengths may have more to do with the common envelope than the actual evolutionary status of irs3(a ) .",
    "perhaps irs3(a ) marks a transition between the class 0 protostar and the class i young stellar object .",
    "we can also estimate the classification of irs3(b ) from the @xmath104 diagram .",
    "the total luminosity of the binary is @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "a range of @xmath107 can be assigned to irs3(b ) , if we associate @xmath108 to irs3(a ) .",
    "the envelope mass , as determined from the 2.7 mm flux density , is @xmath109 . on the @xmath4 diagram , these values place irs3(b ) among the class 0 sources .",
    "if irs3(a ) and irs3(b ) are indeed coeval , then the apparent classification difference between the two sources may yield information about how binary stars evolve and how they interact with each other and/or their environments .",
    "we have obtained high angular resolution ( @xmath110 ) @xmath0  imaging of the protostellar binary system l1448n - irs3(a , b ) .",
    "these observations mark the first time the sources have been spatially resolved at wavelengths @xmath111 mm .",
    "the binary , as a whole , had been previously classified as a class 0 protostar .",
    "the primary result of the work is that only one source , irs3(a ) , was detected at mid - infrared wavelengths .",
    "that is , all of the mid - infrared emission from irs3(a , b ) emanates from irs3(a ) . the mid - infrared luminosity of irs3(a )",
    "is @xmath87 .",
    "the central source mass ( @xmath112 ) of irs3(a ) is comparable to its envelope mass ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "irs3(a ) , with a @xmath96% and an infall rate of @xmath114 m@xmath90 , may be more akin to the class i protostars .",
    "the common envelope surrounding irs3(a ) and irs3(b ) may skew the appearance of irs3(a ) .",
    "perhaps irs3(a ) is viewed at a particular angle that gives it the appearance of both a class 0 and class i source , or perhaps irs3(a ) is a transition object between the two classes .",
    "irs3(b ) , invisible at near and mid - infrared wavelengths , appears to possess a sed dominated by the cold envelope , indicating that irs3(b ) may be a true class 0 protostar .",
    "spatially resolved far - infrared observations ( @xmath115 ) with sirtf , coupled with detailed modeling , are needed to determine the relative contributions of irs3(a ) and irs3(b ) to the emission near the peak of the spectral energy distributions , and the relative evolutionary status of the two sources .",
