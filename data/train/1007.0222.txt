    "the investigation of spectral inverse problems goes back to the famous question of marc kac , can one hear the shape of a drum? @xcite .",
    "this question can be rephrased as does the laplacian on every planar domain with dirichlet boundary conditions have a unique spectrum?. ever since the time when kac posed this fascinating question , physicists and mathematicians alike have attacked the problem from various angles .",
    "attempts were made both to reconstruct the shape of an object from its spectrum and to find different objects that are isospectral , i.e. , have the same spectrum . in 1985 ,",
    "sunada presented a method for constructing isospectral riemannian manifolds @xcite . over the years",
    ", several pairs of isospectral objects were found , but these were not planar domains , and therefore did not serve as an exact answer to kac s question . in 1992 , by applying an extension of sunada s theorem , gordon , webb and wolpert were able to finally answer kac s question as it related to drums , presenting the first pair of isospectral two - dimensional planar domains @xcite . at the same time",
    ", the research of inverse spectral problems extended to include the examination of scattering data .",
    "examples of objects that share the same scattering information were found both for finite area @xcite and infinite area @xcite riemann surfaces .",
    "the search for isospectral and isoscattering examples went further than expected by the original question of kac - it now includes various approaches and a wealth of objects to consider , ranging from riemannian manifolds to discrete graphs .",
    "the interested reader can find more about the field in the reviews @xcite and the references within .",
    "the main result in the field of isospectrality and isoscattering of quantum graphs is that of gutkin and smilansky @xcite , where they use the trace formula to solve the inverse spectral problem of a general quantum graph . they show that under certain conditions a quantum graph can be recovered either from the spectrum of its laplacian or from the overall phase of its scattering matrix .",
    "the necessary conditions include the graph being simple and its edges having rationally independent lengths .",
    "when these conditions are not satisfied , isospectral quantum graphs indeed arise .",
    "examples of isospectral and isoscattering quantum graphs appear in @xcite . a recent work @xcite presents a new method for constructing isospectral objects .",
    "this method is a generalization of sunada s theorem of isospectrality @xcite , as it relaxes its hypothesis .",
    "the present paper makes use of the above mentioned isospectral theory in order to investigate isoscattering problems and relate them to the isospectral research .",
    "we were motivated by @xcite , in which scattering from the exterior of isospectral domains in @xmath0 is discussed .",
    "okada et al .",
    "conjecture in this paper that one may distinguish isospectral drums by measuring sound scattered by the drums .",
    "in other words , in spite of the fact that the two domains are isospectral , the authors suggest that when looked from the exterior , the corresponding scattering matrices have different poles distributions , i.e. , the domains are not isoscattering .",
    "the results that we obtain in this manuscript for quantum graphs shed a new light on the above conjecture .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in the present section we shortly review quantum graphs in the context of isospectrality and scattering matrices .",
    "we then bring a basic example which we use throughout the paper to demonstrate the obtained results .",
    "section [ sec : isospectrality_and_scattering ] develops a theory which connects scattering matrices to isospectrality and the next section applies it to a few examples .",
    "we end by indicating the link to @xcite , summarizing and suggesting future research directions .",
    "let @xmath1 be a finite graph which consists of @xmath2 vertices connected by @xmath3 edges .",
    "each edge @xmath4 is a one dimensional segment of finite length @xmath5 with a coordinate @xmath6 $ ] and this makes @xmath7 a metric graph .",
    "the metric graph becomes quantum , when we supply it with a differential operator . in the present paper",
    "we choose our operator to be the free schrdinger operator and denote it by @xmath8 .",
    "this is merely the one - dimensional laplacian which equals @xmath9 on each of the edges @xmath4 , and its domain is @xmath10 .",
    "the coupling between the edges is introduced by supplementing vertex conditions at the vertices .",
    "there are many choices of vertex conditions which render the resulting operator self - adjoint , and the most common ones are the neumann vertex conditions , described below .",
    "let @xmath11 , and @xmath12 the set of edges incident to @xmath13 . a function @xmath14 on @xmath7 obeys neumann vertex conditions at @xmath13 if and only if    1 .",

    "the sum of outgoing derivatives of @xmath14 at the vertex @xmath13 equals zero , i.e.,@xmath16    the spectrum of a graph all of whose vertices obey neumann conditions is discrete , non - negative and unbounded .    other typical conditions , which are called dirichlet , set to zero the values of the function at the vertex,@xmath17 and do not put any requirement on the derivatives .    in general , the vertex conditions at a certain vertex @xmath11 can be described in one of two ways :",
    "stating linear equations for the values and the derivatives of the function at the vertex .",

    "the recent papers @xcite present a new isospectral construction method which is based on basic elements of representation theory and can be applied for any geometric object .",
    "we bring here the relevant aspects of the theory as it applies to quantum graphs .",
    "let @xmath7 be a graph which obeys a certain symmetry group @xmath28 .",
    "this means that each element of @xmath28 is a graph automorphism which preserves both the lengths of the edges and the vertex conditions .",
    "denote by @xmath29 the eigenspace of the laplacian on @xmath7 with eigenvalue @xmath30 .",
    "the action of @xmath28 on @xmath7 induces an action of @xmath28 on @xmath29 , by@xmath31 since @xmath29 is closed under the action of @xmath28 , we have that @xmath29 is a carrier space of a certain representation of @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath32 be another representation of @xmath28 with some abstract carrier space @xmath33 .",
    "we consider all linear transformations @xmath34 that respect the action of the group @xmath28 , i.e. , @xmath35 these linear transformations are called intertwiners and they form a vector space which is denoted by @xmath36 .",

    "the dimension of @xmath36 in this case equals the number of copies of @xmath33 that are contained within @xmath29 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that there exists a graph , denoted by @xmath38 , which obeys @xmath39 these papers supply a theorem which gives a sufficient condition for two quotient graphs @xmath40 and @xmath41 to be isospectral , where @xmath42 are representations of two symmetry groups @xmath43 of @xmath7 .",
    "the condition is @xmath44 .",
    "an important element of the isospectral research is the concept of _",
    "transplantation_. this is a transformation between the eigenspace of one object to the eigenspace of its isospectral partner , with the same eigenvalue .",
    "specifically , if @xmath45 are isospectral graphs , then a transplantation is an isomorphism @xmath46 .",
    "a transplantation is therefore quite a useful tool to prove the isospectrality of objects .",
    "the isospectral construction method described in @xcite guarantees a corresponding transplantation .",
    "in general , isospectral objects consist of some elementary building blocks that are attached to each other in a prescribed way to form each of the objects .",
    "the transplantation can be described in terms of these building blocks .",
    "it expresses the restriction of an eigenfunction to a building block of the first object as a linear combination of the restrictions of an eigenfunction to building blocks of the second one .",
    "the transplantation can be therefore described by a matrix whose dimension equals to the number of the building blocks .",
    "furthermore , this matrix is independent of the spectral parameter @xmath47 .",
    "it is important to note that isospectrality does not necessarily imply transplantability .",
    "namely , there are examples of isospectral objects for which there is no known transplantation .",
    "such an example appears in section [ sec : lack_of_transplantability ] .      to convert a compact graph @xmath7 into a scattering system ,",
    "one can connect its vertices ( all or a subset ) by leads which extend to infinity .",
    "we will denote by @xmath48 the extended quantum graph which consists of the original graph @xmath7 and the external leads .",
    "given @xmath7 , the additional information that one needs in order to describe its extension @xmath48 consists of the set of vertices to which the leads are connected and also , the modified vertex conditions at these vertices .",
    "the vertices which are not connected to leads in @xmath48 have the same vertex conditions as they had in @xmath7 .",
    "it is therefore clear that there is more than one possible way to turn a compact graph @xmath7 into a scattering system .",
    "the graph @xmath48 has a continuous spectrum and we denote by @xmath49 the space of all generalized eigenfunctions of @xmath48 with eigenvalue @xmath30 : they are called generalized since they do not necessarily have a bounded @xmath50-norm .",
    "let @xmath51 and let @xmath52 be the set of leads connected to @xmath7 .",
    "then the restriction of @xmath14 to the lead @xmath53 can be written in the form    @xmath54    collecting all the variables @xmath55 and @xmath56 into the vectors @xmath57 and @xmath58 , we introduce the shorthand notation@xmath59 using the vertex conditions on all the vertices of the graph , we get equations whose variables contain @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "simple algebraic manipulations allow to find a relation of the following type@xmath60 where @xmath61 is a square matrix of dimension @xmath62 and it is unitary for every @xmath63 .",
    "this is the scattering matrix of the graph @xmath48 .",
    "the existence and uniqueness of @xmath61 for every value of @xmath47 and its unitarity on the real axis are proved in @xcite .",
    "once @xmath61 is given , we may consider a graph @xmath64 which consists of a single vertex , connected to the same number of leads as @xmath48 and with vertex conditions given by @xmath61 .",
    "the graphs @xmath64 and @xmath48 share the same spectral properties and their eigenfunctions coincide on the leads .",
    "some of the information about the graph s complex structure is contained within the function @xmath61 . in particular",
    ", @xmath61 contains the spectral information of @xmath7 as is presented by the  exterior - interior duality for graphs @xcite .",
    "this means that the eigenvalues of @xmath7 can be identified as the solutions of the equation @xmath65 where @xmath48 is any extension of @xmath7 , with neumann conditions at the vertices attached to the leads .",
    "all of the above makes one wonder about the data that is contained in the scattering matrix and its comparison to the spectral information .",
    "this motivates the following definitions    let @xmath66 and @xmath67 be two quantum graphs .",
    "they are called @xmath68 if their scattering matrices @xmath69 share the same poles on the complex plane .",
    "let @xmath66 and @xmath67 be two quantum graphs .",
    "they are called @xmath70 if they satisfy the following condition @xmath71    we will use the term @xmath72 to refer to either @xmath68 or @xmath70 quantum graphs .",
    "the present paper treats the construction of isoscattering graphs and the relation of isospectrality to isoscattering .",
    "in this section we explain using a simple example the idea of the quotient graph construction .",
    "we then use this example throughout the paper to illustrate its main results . following the discussion after equation ( [ eq : basic_scattering_relation ] )",

    "the action of @xmath85 on the leads of @xmath73 gives the following orbits : @xmath86 let us restrict our attention to those functions @xmath81 which transform under the action of @xmath85 according to the trivial representation @xmath87 of @xmath85 .",
    "this means that :    @xmath88 therefore , it is enough to know the values of the function @xmath14 on the three leads @xmath89 and @xmath90 , being representatives of each orbit , to deduce its values on the whole of @xmath91 we wish to encode the information about such a function and may do so by constructing the so - called quotient graph .",
    "the quotient , which we denote by @xmath75 has three leads , each is a representative of an orbit of the @xmath85-action ( figure [ flo : rys](b ) ) .",
    "the encoding is described by the map @xmath92 that acts on functions which transforms under the action of @xmath85 according to representation @xmath87 .",
    "it takes the values of such @xmath81 restricted to the leads @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath90 and assigns them to the function @xmath95 on the leads @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 of @xmath75 . by the construction",
    "we see that @xmath95 satisfies the following vertex conditions@xmath99    @xmath100 we therefore equip @xmath75 with neumann condition at its vertex . in general",
    "the vertex conditions at each vertex of a quotient graph @xmath101 are determined by the vertex conditions of the corresponding vertices in @xmath73 combined with the group action and the representation @xmath32 .",
    "the exact formula for the general case is given in @xcite .",

    "the quotient @xmath106 , can be inferred using similar reasoning as in the case of @xmath75 , and it turns out to be a single lead with neumann vertex condition ( figure [ flo : qr1r2](a ) ) . in order to construct @xmath107 we choose a basis in @xmath108 and write the corresponding matrix representation @xmath109 of @xmath104 .",
    "such a choice gives for example :    @xmath110    the representation @xmath104 is two dimensional , which means we need to consider two linearly independent functions @xmath111 that transform under the action of @xmath28 according to the representation @xmath104 , and in particular    @xmath112^{t}=(\\rho^{r_{2d}}(g))[f_{1}|_{l_{e}},f_{2}|_{l_{e}}]^{t}.\\label{eq : rep2d}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the restriction of @xmath113 and @xmath114 to @xmath93 together with property ( [ eq : rep2d ] ) can be used to determine the values of @xmath115 on the whole of @xmath73 .",
    "the encoding process therefore requires two leads , which is the number of leads in the quotient graph @xmath107 .",
    "it is only left to conclude the vertex conditions of this graph . plugging @xmath116 and @xmath117",

    "one can check that using the other group elements we do not add any more linearly independent conditions on the values or on the derivatives of @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",

    "one can also show that if @xmath130 is non - trivial and @xmath32 is an irreducible representation , then the subset @xmath131 is linearly independent if and only if @xmath132 is linearly independent . we therefore restrict ourselves for the moment to the case of irreducible representations , for which we get    @xmath133    having in mind that this isospectral theory is motivated by an encoding scheme",

    "each eigenfunction of the quotient @xmath134 encodes information on some eigenfunction of @xmath48 which transforms just like @xmath13 transforms , under the group action , as it is described by the matrix representations @xmath32 .",
    "in order to relate this construction to the corresponding scattering matrices , we need to rephrase the equations above in terms of the spaces of ingoing and outgoing amplitudes on the leads rather then the eigenspaces . in order to do so , we introduce the notation @xmath135 for the vector space in which @xmath57 lies .",
    "it is easy to see that given @xmath51 , the corresponding vector @xmath136 can be uniquely determined by restricting @xmath14 to the leads and reading the coefficients of the exponents @xmath137 .",
    "in addition , it was shown in @xcite that the opposite also holds , i.e. , @xmath136 uniquely determines the corresponding @xmath51 .",

    "this results from the nature of the encoding and means that the ingoing and the outgoing amplitudes are encoded in exactly the same manner .",
    "namely , for some @xmath144 whose values on the leads are    @xmath145 we have @xmath146    note that in ( [ eq : psi_and_upsilon ] ) we consider the spaces @xmath135 , @xmath139 as spaces which contain not only the ingoing amplitudes vectors @xmath147 , but also the outgoing ones , @xmath148 .",

    "the different poles distributions indicate that the scattering matrices are not conjugate , as opposed to the result obtained in section [ sec : isoscattering_graphs ] .",
    "we therefore conclude that there is no transplantation which relates the values of the non - trivial vertices of these graphs .     and @xmath248 .",
    "this paper discusses the linkage between isospectrality and isoscattering of quantum graphs .",
    "we have described how to produce isoscattering graphs using the recently developed isospectral construction method @xcite .",
    "isoscattering graphs can be produced in two ways .",
    "one can start from a certain graph with leads which forms a scattering system , and construct out of it two graphs with leads that are isoscattering .",
    "another approach is to start from two graphs that are known to be isospectral and discover all the possible ways in which leads can be attached to the graphs to turn them into isoscattering .",
    "both ways are applications of the isospectral construction method and as such they indicate that turning a graph into a scattering system do not reveal more information on the graph then is already given by its spectrum .",
    "this is compatible with the exterior - interior duality that relates the spectral information with the scattering data .",
    "it is interesting to compare this result with the conjecture brought in a recent work by okada et .",
    "@xcite in which the scattering from the exterior of isospectral domains in @xmath0 is discussed .",
    "the authors conjecture that the distributions of the poles of the two scattering matrices distinguish between the two domains .",
    "in other words , in spite of the fact that the two domains are isospectral , okada et .",
    "al . suggest that they are not isoscattering .",
    "this proposition is not proved , but it is ushered by heuristic arguments based on calculation of the fredholm determinant , and augmented by numerical simulations .",
    "the simulations are performed on the isospectral domains in @xmath0 that appear in @xcite .",
    "we have shown that two isospectral graphs can be turned into isoscattering systems in more than one possible way .",
    "however , not every way of attaching leads to the isospectral graphs would make them isoscattering .",
    "the leads should be connected in a way which reflects the underlying symmetry that was used for the construction of the isospectral pair .",
    "this may suggest that the result in @xcite is a consequence of the fact that the outside scattering problem of the isospectral drums breaks the symmetry that was used in the isospectral drums construction . in @xcite",
    "these drums are obtained from a group of isometries of the hyperbolic plane .",
    "the construction there yields two quotients which are composed of seven copies of a hyperbolic triangle assembled in different configurations .",
    "the planar isospectral drums are then obtained by replacing the fundamental hyperbolic triangle with a suitable euclidean one .",
    "it should be noted that the hyperbolic drums are isometric and they become non - isometric only after the replacement with the euclidean triangles .",
    "therefore , the hyperbolic drums which obey the underlying symmetry are trivially isoscattering , being isometric .",
    "the isoscattering property that we have obtained is a direct consequence of the existence of a transplantation .",
    "the transplantation is guaranteed by the isospectral construction method of @xcite , but also appears in other isospectral constructions .",
    "we therefore get that the ability to turn isospectral graphs into isoscattering is not restricted only to those graphs constructed by the discussed isospectral method , but is possible for others as well , as long as the transplantation exists .",
    "this observation supplies us with a technique to check the transplantability property of two graphs that are known to be isospectral .",
    "all we need to do is to connect leads to the sets of vertices which we suspect to be transplantable and to check whether the corresponding scattering matrices are conjugate .",
    "an example of an isospectral pair which does not possess the transplantation property is given in section [ sec : lack_of_transplantability ] .",
    "the key element of the isospectral theory developed in @xcite is the notion of the quotient graph .",
    "we have made use of the quotient construction in the present paper as well , in order to produce isoscattering pairs .",
    "while doing so we obtained a relation between the scattering matrix of a graph and that of its quotient .",
    "this , not only sheds more light on the properties of the quotient graph , but also gives an alternative description of the quotient .",
    "as was already mentioned , the vertex conditions of a quantum graph can be described in two ways .",
    "one is by a linear set of equations on the function s values and derivatives at the vertex .",
    "the other is by a scattering matrix which connects the ingoing amplitudes to the outgoing ones at the vertex .",
    "the current isospectral theory in @xcite deals with vertex conditions of the first type and describes the quotient construction in these terms . therefore ,",
    "allowing to construct a quotient from a graph whose vertex conditions are of the second type gives a new perspective to the isospectral theory and broadens the class of graphs for which the theory can be applied .",
