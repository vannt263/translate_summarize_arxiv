    "quantum memory is a key resource for many quantum - information protocols .",
    "usually it is associated with the basic requirements for quantum computation  @xcite , but in recent years also quantum communication protocols started to rely on it .",
    "the requirement of memory was introduced in quantum communication as part of the idea for quantum repeaters  @xcite , a possible solution for the problem of quantum communication over long distances . in this case , memory is essential to increase the probability of success of the chain of conditional steps that underlies the protocol , and makes feasible scalable quantum networks .    a significant step toward the realization of the quantum repeater idea was a proposal by duan , lukin , cirac , and zoller ( dlcz ) for its implementation using linear optics and atomic ensembles  @xcite .",
    "the dlcz protocol is based on the generation of single photons by spontaneous raman scattering in atomic ensembles  @xcite .",
    "the detection of a single photon in the forward propagating mode heralds the presence of a single collective atomic excitation in the sample , due to a collective enhancement effect .",
    "this excitation can be stored for a time up to the coherence time of the ground states of the atoms and then converted back into a light field .",
    "entanglement of distant ensembles in the excitation number basis is generated by interference  @xcite , and extended to longer distances by entanglement swapping  @xcite .",
    "the final pairs of ensembles , far apart , can then be used for entanglement - based quantum cryptography  @xcite , probabilistic quantum teleportation and violation of bell inequality .",
    "this proposal has received much attention in the past two years and several groups are presently pursuing its experimental implementation  @xcite .    in this article , we analyze the decoherence processes present in the dlcz protocol , and describe experiments to mitigate the problem .",
    "we construct a theory for the decoherence process in the photon - pair generation .",
    "particularly , our analysis concentrates in its implementation with cold atomic ensembles , but many results should also apply to studies with room - temperature ensembles in vapor cells .",
    "we propose various strategies to increase the system s coherence time , and introduce experimental techniques necessary for its characterization and control .",
    "we also report the first experimental steps in this direction , with an increase of more than two order of magnitude in the coherence time with respect to the previously reported works with cold atoms  @xcite .",
    "the coherence times reported up to now by the several groups working on the implementation of the protocol are all shorter or of the order of a couple of microseconds .",
    "furthermore , for all experiments to date , the reported coherence times are of the order of the excitation pulses duration .",
    "however , for using this system as a quantum memory , it is important to obtain storage time much longer than the excitation pulses .",
    "moreover , for the dlcz protocol to become a viable alternative for long distance quantum communication , long coherence time is crucial and major efforts are required to increase it .",
    "the main goal of the present article is then to provide the initial steps in this direction , and to establish several techniques and ideas for the next steps .",
    "only two types of systems have been employed in the experiments up to now : vapor cells  @xcite and cold atoms in magneto - optical traps  @xcite . in both systems , however , the experiments have not achieved yet their respective state - of - the - art coherence times .",
    "the vapor - cell studies , for example , did not employ paraffin coated cells  @xcite ; the coherence times were effectively limited to the time the atoms take to diffuse out of the excitation region , which is of the order of microseconds . recently , high fidelity atomic quantum memory of the state of a light pulse was achieved with such paraffin coated cells  @xcite with memory times of up to 4  ms .",
    "coherence times of tens of milliseconds , however , are commonly achieved in this system  @xcite , and there are reports of coherence times as high as one second  @xcite .",
    "the difference in these values is largely due to measurements of decay of different coherent processes  @xcite . how the coherence required for the generation of photon pairs from atomic vapors will decay as the atoms collide with the walls of paraffin coated cells is still to be determined .",
    "the use of atomic traps to generate photon pairs for the dlcz protocol has the advantage of providing a high density of atoms distributed in a small spectral region , due to the suppression of doppler broadening by the cooling process .",
    "this allows the use of excitation laser pulses tuned closer to resonance , which requires much less power and makes it easier to filter the excitation pulses from the ramam - scattered photons .",
    "however , atomic traps also introduce a different set of complications . in the case of the magneto - optical traps ( mot )",
    "used up to now , the magnetic field of the trap induces decoherence on a timescale of the order or smaller than a few hundreds nanoseconds  @xcite .",
    "the first results with the mot magnetic field off are reported in the present article , with coherence times on the order of 10  @xmath1s . as will be discussed below in detail",
    ", a better nulling of the magnetic field combined with optical pumping to specific zeeman levels might increase the coherence time , in a straightforward way , to hundreds of microseconds .",
    "further improvements with mots would face the problem of diffusion of atoms from the excitation region and , most troublesome , from the mot itself .",
    "this problem can in principle be mitigated by improved cooling techniques .",
    "however , along these lines , it would be difficult to increase the coherence time above a couple of milliseconds .",
    "a possible solution then is to use an optical dipole trap to hold the atoms during the write - and - read process .",
    "hyperfine coherence times of hundreds of milliseconds have already been observed in such traps  @xcite .    in the following ,",

    "the building block of the dlcz protocol is an ensemble of @xmath2 identical atoms with lambda - type energy level configuration as shown in fig .",

    "the lower states @xmath3 and @xmath4 are hyperfine sublevels of the electronic ground state of cesium atoms .",
    "first , all atoms are prepared in the state @xmath3 . by sending in a weak , off - resonant laser pulse , one atom of the ensemble might be transfered from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , thus emitting a photon ( field @xmath5 ) at a frequency or polarization different from the original exciting field .",
    "a key element of the protocol is the collective enhancement of this spontaneous raman scattering in a forward direction , which is determined by the spatial mode of the laser pulse and the geometry of the excitation region  @xcite .",
    "if the laser intensity is low enough so that two excitations are very unlikely , the detection of the photon generated in this process is a signature that the ensemble was excited to a symmetrical collective state  @xcite , which in the ideal case can be explicitly written as @xmath6 where the sum goes over all atoms addressed by the laser pulse , and @xmath7 indicates the state of the atomic ensemble with just one excitation .",
    "this is the  writing \" step of the protocol ( fig .  [",
    "3level]a ) .",
    "since the excitation probability @xmath8 is very small , the whole state of the system consisting of atoms and forward - scattered mode of light is in the following form : @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 stands for the state of the forward - propagating light field @xmath5 with @xmath12 photons , @xmath13 is a phase set by propagation to and from the ensemble , and @xmath14 .",

    "fields 1 and 2 exhibit now strong correlations in the photon number basis , and can be described as photon pairs .",

    "the mot quadrupole field generates an inhomogeneous distribution of splittings throughout the ensemble .",
    "as the system evolves in time , this results in dephasing between different regions of the atomic cloud , and in a respective decay of the coherence of the collective state .",
    "it is also important to include explicitly the reading process in the theory . for simplicity ,",
    "this is done by considering a read process similar to the write process , i.e. , with small probability of excitation and detuned from the excited state .",

    "this will lead to small discrepancies when comparing the experimental results to the theory , that will be discussed in section [ 2photon ] .",

    "it also allows the investigation of the role of the atomic initial state on the measured correlations . in fig .",
    "[ op ] we give two examples of possible ways to improve the system .",
    "the solid and dashed lines in the figure represent the two experimental conditions of fig .",
    "[ g12old ] ( initially unpolarized samples with @xmath245  mhz and @xmath246  khz ) , but now with the same scaling factor .",
    "the dash - dotted curve shows how the @xmath246  khz curve changes if the system is initially spin polarized , with all atoms in the @xmath247 state .",
    "note that in this case the value of @xmath248 considerably increases , and the system develops a plateau coming from the predominant transition @xmath249 , which is magnetic - field insensitive .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to devise a polarization scheme of excitation that allows only this specific transition for any @xmath166 , e.g. as when the write pulse and field-1 detection are @xmath250 polarized , and the read pulse and field-2 detection are @xmath251 .",
    "this is the case for the dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ op ] .",
    "the idealized improvements described by the dotted and dash - dotted curves of fig",
    ".  [ op ] , however , will probably be limited by two effects which are not taken into account by the theory .",
    "first , in our experimental setup we should see a decay with a timescale on the order of 360  @xmath1s due to the average time the cold atoms take to cross the 60  @xmath1 m beam diameter of the classical write and read pulses .",
    "second , the theory assumes the presence of a magnetic field predominantly in the z direction , which defines the quantization axis .",
    "this can be obtained by applying an extra dc magnetic field along that direction,@xcite but any residual transverse field should lead to some decay of the plateau . in spite of these restrictions , however , we believe that such improvements could lead to an increase of more than an order of magnitude over the largest experimental decoherence time of fig .  [ g12old ] .",
    "it is also clear that there is a benefit in the careful preparation of the initial state for the magnitude of the measured correlations .",
    "this is an important point that should also be taken into account when considering the implementation of the dlcz protocol in vapor cells .",
    "we have presented a detailed study of the decoherence processes in the generation of photon pairs from atomic ensembles , via the dlcz protocol of ref .",
    "we have identified the main cause of decoherence for cold atoms in magneto - optical traps as being the inhomogeneous broadening of the hyperfine ground states due to the quadrupole magnetic field used to trap the atoms .",
    "a detailed theory has been developed to model this effect .",
    "we also reported a series of measurement to characterize and control the decoherence using copropagating stimulated raman scattering .",
    "these measurement allowed us to switch off the quadrupole magnetic field in a controlled way . with the magnetic field off , we observed highly nonclassical correlations between the two emitted photons , for a storage time of up to 10 @xmath1s , an improvement of more than two orders of magnitude compared to previous results with cold atoms .",
    "furthermore , contrary to all related experiments reported up to now , the coherence time is now two orders of magnitude larger than the excitation pulses duration .",
    "this is a crucial step in order to use atomic ensembles as a quantum memory to store conditional single photon states or entanglement between two distant ensembles .",
