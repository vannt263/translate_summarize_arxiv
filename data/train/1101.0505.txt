    "our insight in some novel phenomena in this field was extended during the last decades .",
    "the most intriguing among them are the chaos assisted tunneling ( cat ) and the closely related coherent destruction of tunneling ( cdt ) .    in particular , the former is an enhancement of tunneling in the perturbed low - dimensional systems at small external field strengths and driving frequencies  @xcite .",

    "considers tunneling between kam - tori embedded into the `` chaotic sea '' .",
    "the region of chaotic motion affects tunneling rate because , compared to direct tunneling between tori , it is easier for the system to penetrate primarily into the chaotic region , to travel then along some classically allowed path and finally to tunnel onto another kam - torus  @xcite .",
    "the latter , cdt phenomenon , is a suppression of tunneling which occurs due to the exact crossing of two states with different symmetries from the tunneling doublet @xcite . in this case",

    "the main purpose of the present study is to prove the ability of developed chaotic instanton approach to give quantitative analytical description of tunneling in polychromatically perturbed systems well agreed with independent numerical calculations based on floquet theory .",

    "chaotic instantons are analyzed using averaged time - independent hamiltonian of the kicked system in section  [ sec : sys ] .",
    "results obtained by means of the averaged hamiltonian are used in section [ sec : formula ] to derive analytical formula for lowest quasienergy doublet splitting dependence on perturbation parameter in single kicked system .",
    "numerical calculations are performed to check the validity of this formula in the section  [ sec : num ] .",
    "multiple and polychromatic kick perturbations are considered in the sections [ sec:2kick ] and [ sec : aperiod ] , respectively .",
    "hamiltonian of the particle in the double - well potential can be written down in the following form : @xmath2 where @xmath3 - mass of the particle , @xmath4 - parameters of the potential .",

    "dependence of the perturbation on coordinate was chosen in the form of @xmath9 in order to preserve spatial symmetry in the perturbed system .",
    "hamiltonian of this system is @xmath10    now we implement wick rotation ( @xmath11 ) and define euclidean hamiltonian @xmath12 where @xmath13 - nonperturbed euclidean hamiltonian which is given by @xmath14    euclidean equations of motion of the particle in the nonperturbed double - well potential ( @xmath15 ) have a well known solution - instanton . this solution is used for calculation of the ground energy splitting in the system without perturbation @xcite and explains the rate of the tunneling process in it .",
