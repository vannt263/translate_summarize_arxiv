    "there has been a growing interest in optical fiber lasers that operate based on the gain - guiding index - antiguiding ( gg+iag ) principle . unlike a conventional index - guiding ( ig ) fiber ,",
    "the core of an iag fiber has a lower refractive index than the surrounding cladding and can not support ig modes .",
    "siegman  @xcite has shown that in the presence of sufficient gain , an iag fiber can support confined propagating gg modes , which are normalizable in the transverse direction .",
    "more interestingly , even for arbitrarily large core diameters , gg+iag fibers can operate in a robust single transverse mode .",
    "it is therefore desirable to take advantage of the gg+iag principle and scale up the core size while maintaining the single - mode characteristic .",
    "the large core size is attractive because it can help mitigate the unwanted nonlinear optical effects , raise the optical damage threshold , and increase the amplification per unit length of the fiber .",
    "several experiments have demonstrated gg+iag in various fiber laser configurations  @xcite .",
    "the reported values of the beam quality factor @xmath0 in these experiments are notably larger than unity , even in fibers that are designed to operate as single - mode",
    ". this should not be surprising considering the substantial departure of the lp01 profile of a gg+iag fiber from a gaussian - like beam  @xcite , as similarly reported in other unconventional optical fibers  @xcite .",
    "however , we show that the values of @xmath0 for the single - mode gg+iag fibers are substantially larger those measured in the experiments",
    ". therefore , the not - so - puzzling larger than unity @xmath0 measurements in these fibers turn out to be quite lower than expected from a pure gg+iag structure .",
    "we present a closed form expression for the @xmath0 parameter of the lp01 mode in the presence of gain as a function of the complex generalized fiber v - number .",
    "the @xmath0 parameter has been calculated analytically for the lpmn modes in passive fibers  @xcite .",
    "however , we are not aware of a derivation in the presence of gain , which requires integrals of complex variables and is mathematically more involved . in this paper , we only present the final results and details of the analytical derivation will be reported elsewhere .",
    "in order to study step - index optical fibers in the presence of gain ( gg+ig or gg+iag ) , it is convenient to use a generalized complex v parameter squared  @xcite defined as @xmath1 the index and gain parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 are given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the refractive index of the cladding .",
    "@xmath6 is the refractive index of the core , @xmath7 is the core radius , @xmath8 is core power - gain coefficient , and @xmath9 is the vacuum wavelength . for a proper choice of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the core can support an lp01 guided mode in the form of @xmath10 the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 are complex and satisfy the following two equation , which can be used to determine these parameters , given @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 @xmath15 is an overall constant to be determined from the normalization condition ( [ eq : normalization ] ) assumed throughout this paper , @xmath16 where @xmath17 . in general",
    ", the value of @xmath13 determines the total number of confined guided modes in a fiber in the presence of gain , which can be zero or higher .",
    "the single - mode operating regions of the gg+ig and gg+iag structures in the @xmath2-@xmath3 cartesian space are presented in detail by siegman  @xcite and will not be repeated here .",
    "the beam quality factor @xmath0 is commonly used in experiments to determine whether a fiber laser is single - mode or not . for single - mode fiber lasers , the value of @xmath0 is near unity , while @xmath18 is indicative of beam contamination with higher order modes . in order to calculate the @xmath0",
    ", we adopt the variance method , which is mathematically rigorous and closely resembles the common experimental procedures for the @xmath0 measurement @xcite .",
    "consider an optical beam with the electric field profile @xmath19 propagating in the @xmath20 direction .",
    "the beam center @xmath21 and the standard deviation of the intensity distribution @xmath22 across the @xmath23 coordinate are @xmath24 since we only consider cylindrically symmetric optical fibers , the results are identical for the @xmath25 coordinate , and we take the liberty in dropping the @xmath23 subscript ( e.g. @xmath0 ) when convenient .",
    "it can be shown that the standard deviation in eq .",
    "[ eq : stddev ] , in the paraxial approximation , obeys a universal free - space propagation rule of the form @xmath26 @xmath27 is the coordinate of the output facet of the fiber which does not necessarily coincide with the position of the beam waist .",
    "@xcite has shown that @xmath28,\\\\ \\label{eq : defineb } b&=\\iint ds \\left|\\dfrac{\\partial e}{\\partial x}\\right|^2 + \\dfrac{1}{4}\\big[\\iint ds(e\\dfrac{\\partial e^\\star}{\\partial x } -c.c.)\\big]^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is implied in eqs .",
    "[ eq : definea ] and  [ eq : defineb ] .",
    "the position of the beam waist @xmath30 and the beam - quality factor @xmath31 are given by @xmath32 we note that we slightly differ with ref .",
    "@xcite in the sign of the frequency term and also the definition of the @xmath33 term .",
    "while the integrals leading the evaluation of the @xmath0 parameter can be evaluated numerically , one is faced with the challenge of reliably truncating the infinite integrals .",
    "it is difficult to choose a reliable truncation radius , a priori , for a desired error .",
    "therefore , a closed - form analytical expression is highly desirable . using the parameters defined in eqs .",

[",
    "fig : m21 ] ,  [ fig : m22 ] ,  [ fig : m23 ] .",
    "the dashed lines in these figures identify the threshold values of the dimensionless gain parameter @xmath3 required to produce a confined and amplifying lp01 mode as described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : m21 ] , related to the gg+ig region , show that @xmath0 remains very close to unity over most of the parameter space .",
    "a typical single - mode fiber laser operates at @xmath38 , for which @xmath39 , regardless of the value of the @xmath3 parameter .",
    "this is consistent with the common intuition that the beam quality of a single - mode fiber laser is very good and does not degrade by pumping , unless higher order modes are excited .",
    "however , the beam quality factor rapidly increases as the @xmath13-parameter of the fiber gets closer to the ( dashed ) lp01 threshold .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : m22 ] which is similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : m21 ] but zoomed in near the origin and the close proximity of the lp01 threshold line .",
    "the situation is quite different in the gg+iag region as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m23 ] .",
    "@xmath0 is quite large over the entire parameter space and becomes exceptionally large near the ( dashed ) lp01 threshold .",
    "the large value of the @xmath0 especially near the threshold is the result of the long tail of the beam intensity extending all the way into the cladding region over a large portion of the gg+iag parameter space  @xcite .",
    "the situation closely resembles the case of a conventional ig fiber ( @xmath40 ) , where the tails of the beam extend to the cladding in the weakly guiding limit of @xmath41 , resulting in large values of @xmath0 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m22 ] .",
    "we note that the numerical evaluation of @xmath0 becomes increasingly difficult in the regions of large @xmath0 and proper care must be taken in the sampling and truncation of the beam to get an accurate result .    in order to explore the impact of the long intensity tail in the cladding on the value of @xmath0",
    ", we introduce a gaussian apodization function of the form @xmath42 to softly truncate the long intensity tail of beam .",
    "we multiply the beam profile of eq .",
    "[ eq : e_definition ] by the apodization function and calculate the @xmath0 numerically .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : m24 ] where @xmath0 is plotted as a function of @xmath3 for @xmath43 .",
    "the dotted line is the value of @xmath0 in the absence of the apodization function .",
    "the three solid lines represent the calculated values of @xmath0 for the apodized beam and are marked by different values of @xmath44 from the apodization function .",
    "[ fig : m24 ] clearly shows that the truncation of the intensity tail of the gg+iag beams results in a substantial reduction in the calculated value of @xmath0 .",
    "the above observations are quite important in relating the @xmath0 values reported in this paper , especially for the gg+iag region of fig .",
    "[ fig : m23 ] to the experimental measurements . in practice",
    ", the extended tail of the gg+iag beam is truncated at the cladding - jacket ( or cladding - air ) interface .",
    "for example , for @xmath43 and @xmath3 equal to twice the lp01 threshold value , the field amplitude drops only by 25% from @xmath45 to @xmath46 ; for @xmath47 , this drop in amplitude is only 13% .",
    "therefore , the impact of the cladding - jacket interface on the tail of beam warrants close attention .",
    "we have shown that @xmath0 can be substantially larger than unity even for single - mode fibers in the gg+iag region .",
    "the large value of @xmath0 in the gg+iag region is the result of the long tail of the beam extending all the way into the cladding region , the truncation of which can lower @xmath0 substantially .",
    "the reported values of @xmath0 in several experiments on gg+iag fiber lasers are in the range of 1.05 - 2.0  @xcite .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite reports @xmath48 for a gg+iag optical fiber with a 100 @xmath49 core diameter and a 250 @xmath49 cladding diameter .",
    "similarly , ref .",
    "@xcite reports @xmath50 , where the core and cladding diameters are 200  @xmath49 and 340  @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "the cladding diameter is not much larger than the core diameter in either experiments .",
    "consequently , the long cladding tail of the lp01 beam is truncated at the cladding - jacket interface over a large portion of the @xmath2-@xmath3 parameter space in the gg+iag region .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that these experiments measure such low values of @xmath0 .",
    "we expect that very large values of @xmath0 will be observed in gg+iag single - mode fibers with sufficiently large cladding to core diameter ratios .",
    "measurement of @xmath0 can be challenging for these fibers since the presence of noise can impact an accurate assessment of the tail intensity .",
    "the existing experiments  @xcite deviate from the pure gg+iag formalism of siegman  @xcite in the sense that the cladding - core diameter ratios are not sufficiently large .",
    "therefore , an accurate @xmath0 comparison with these experiments is only possible if the presence of the cladding - jacket interface is explicitly taken into account . besides the impact on the value of @xmath0",
    ", one must examine whether the truncated mode remains faithful to its gg+iag nature or is modified into a mode which is primarily index - guided by the cladding - jacket index step .",
    "the analytical results of this paper have been independently verified by direct numerical computation . in order to facilitate the implementation of the analytical results in this paper for the interested reader",
    ", we present the numerical values of the analytical solution at @xmath51 .",
