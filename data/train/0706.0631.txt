    "magnetic field penetrates type - ii superconductors as a set of quantized flux lines  vortices .",
    "macroscopically , the vortex matter can be considered as a `` flux liquid '' .",
    "an important feature of this matter is pinning of vortices leading to zero electrical resistance at zero temperature . the pinning results in a non - uniform distribution of magnetic flux forming a _ critical state_. the critical state determines the macroscopic properties , e.g. the maximum current density and magnetic susceptibility , that are important for applications . according to the critical state model,@xcite at any point of the sample",
    "the local value of the electrical current density is equal to its critical value , @xmath8 , for a given magnetic field and temperature .",
    "an interesting property of the critical state is that _ local _ material defects affect the field and current distributions on a _ global _ scale .",
    "for example , even a small non - superconducting cavity or an edge indentation create sample - spanning discontinuity lines where the current flow direction changes abruptly.@xcite at a non - zero temperature , the critical state is relaxed due to flux creep that is conventionally described by a highly nonlinear current - voltage curve , @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is electric field .",
    "nevertheless , the same tendency persists : a small cavity of size @xmath12 in a bulk superconductor perturbs the field distributions on a much larger scale of @xmath13.@xcite many applications of superconductors are based on thin films where this tendency must be even stronger since the relation between the magnetic field and current is _",
    "nonlocal_.@xcite usually this leads to poorer performance of superconducting devices whose global properties are deteriorated by numerous natural defects blocking the current flow . however , the same tendency can help control the flux motion on a global scale by patterning the superconductor with arrays of small holes designed , e.g. , to guide the flux in a particular direction.@xcite    surprisingly , a quantitative understanding on how a single local defect affects the flux penetration into a superconducting film is still rather poor . even the simple case of an infinitely long thin strip with a semicircular edge - indentation is not solved . for a bulk superconductor in the critical state",
    "such an indentation creates an excess flux penetration exactly equal to the indentation radius.@xcite however the nonlocal electrodynamics in thin films and hence the presence of meissner currents in the flux - free regions make the picture much more complicated.@xcite it has been observed using magneto - optic imaging that the excess flux penetration in films can significantly exceed the size of the indentation it originates from.@xcite the physical mechanism behind this enhancement is however not yet understood .",
    "it could be related to the effect of thin - film geometry , to the flux creep or to thermal instabilities nucleated at the indentation .",
    "this work aims to clarify this question by presenting a detailed study of flux penetration into a strip with a semicircular edge - indentation in the flux creep regime .",
    "we determine how the excess penetration depends on the size of the indentation , the applied magnetic field and the creep exponent @xmath14 .",
    "consider a thin superconducting strip of thickness @xmath15 placed in a transverse magnetic field .",
    "the strip is infinite in the @xmath16-direction , has the width @xmath17 in the @xmath18-direction and a semicircular indentation with radius @xmath3 at the edge , see fig .  [",
    "fig : sample ] .",
    "the flux dynamics in the creep regime is conventionally described using a local relation between electric field @xmath19 and current density @xmath20,@xcite @xmath21 with a highly nonlinear resistivity @xmath22 which does not explicitly depend on the magnetic induction @xmath23 . here",
    "@xmath24 is a constant , @xmath8 is the critical current density , while @xmath14 is the creep exponent , @xmath10 .",
    "this exponent can be related to the activation energy @xmath25 for thermal depinning as @xmath26 .",
    "hence , large @xmath14 means small creep , and the bean critical state model@xcite is regained in the limit @xmath27 .    for numerical simulations of flux penetration into the strip we use the formalism developed by brandt@xcite that can be applied to thin type - ii superconductors of various shapes . for a thin superconductor ,",
    "it is appropriate to look at length scales larger than the thickness @xmath15 , and introduce a sheet current @xmath28 where @xmath29 are in - plane coordinates . due to the current conservation , @xmath30",
    ", the sheet current can be expressed through a scalar function @xmath31 as @xmath32 where @xmath33 has the interpretation of the local magnetization.@xcite substituting the current from eq .",
    "( [ eq : cd001 ] ) into the biot - savart law one arrives at a non - local relation between @xmath34 and @xmath33 , @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the applied field and @xmath37 is the sample area .",

    "is divergent at @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in a numerical procedure",
    ", the divergence can be handled in three ways : ( i ) by keeping a finite @xmath41 during the calculation;@xcite ( ii ) by working in the fourier space;@xcite ( iii ) by converting the integral to a matrix form and using the flux conservation to determine the diagonal elements.@xcite here we use the third method . since",
    ", for @xmath42 , the total flux through the @xmath43 plane is zero , the kernel should have the property @xmath44 .",
    "this yields @xmath45 where the scalar function @xmath46 is an integral over the area _",
    "outside _ the superconductor @xmath47 for a uniform strip of width @xmath48 it yields @xmath49 in addition , the indentation gives a contribution from the semicircle , which is calculated numerically from  eq .  .",
    "[ fig : h ]    in the following we use an equidistant square grid and ascribe the same area @xmath50 to each grid point .",
    "the discrete version of the kernel then acquires the form@xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 for @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "all elements of the discrete kernel eq .   are nondivergent and the flux conservation , @xmath55 , is guaranteed . relating the magnetic field and the current by the faraday s law , and using the inverted biot - savart law one obtains the dynamic equation for the local magnetization : @xmath56     ,    \\label{dynamics}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 for discrete formulation of the problem the inverse kernel @xmath58 is just the inverse of the matrix eq .",

    "the flux penetrates from the edges forming well - defined flux fronts that move towards the strip center as the applied field increases . shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : h ] is a typical result of the flux density distribution presented as seen in a magneto - optical image , i.e. , the image brightness represents the magnitude of the perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "the sample edge is seen as a bright line , i.e. , the flux density is highest at the edge .",
    "far from the indentation the flux penetration front is straight , and leaves a fraction @xmath62 of the strip in the flux - free meissner state , seen here as a black region .",
    "the penetration of this straight front versus applied field is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fluxfront ] for different values of the creep exponent . for large @xmath14",
    "the simulations approach the bean - model result,@xcite @xmath63 , while for smaller @xmath14 , i.e. , stronger flux creep , the penetration is deeper , all as expected for a strip with straight edges .    near the indentation",
    "the flux penetration largely follows the circular shape . at both sides of the indentation",
    "there are dark regions of reduced flux density .",
    "as penetration gets deeper these will become narrow @xmath15-lines , where the current stream lines make sharp turns.@xcite in the bean limit @xmath27 , the @xmath15-lines of semicircular indentations have parabolic shape . with finite @xmath14 the parabolic shape is only approximated .",
    "however , the main effect of the indentation is that it pushes magnetic field deeper into the sample . in order to quantify this",
    "we define the excess penetration @xmath1 as the difference between the deepest penetration and the penetration far away from the indentation .",
    "[ fig : distortion ] shows how @xmath1 evolves with increasing @xmath36 . evidently , the excess penetration is not equal to the indentation radius , @xmath3 , as in the case of the bulk bean model.@xcite moreover , @xmath1 turns out to be field - dependent .",
    "initially , @xmath1 increases , then reaches a maximum followed by a decrease at larger @xmath36 .",
    "this surprising non - monotonous behaviour is supported by magneto - optical measurements of the flux penetration in a uniform yba@xmath5cu@xmath6o@xmath7 film containing an edge defect , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ybco ] .",
    "the film was shaped as a strip of half - width @xmath64  mm , and the figure shows the flux distribution at 25 k for 3 different applied fields .",
    "in ( a ) the field was very small , @xmath65  mt , creating negligible penetration so that the actual shape of the defect appears in the image as the bright `` bay area '' inside the strip . in this state",
    "the excess penetration is equal to the depth of the defect , and measures @xmath66 m . in ( b ) and ( c ) the applied field is 17  mt and 36  mt , respectively , and the corresponding excess penetration is @xmath67 m and 100 @xmath68 m .",
    "this gives for @xmath69 and 0.25 , demonstrating an excess penetration that exceeds the depth of the indentation by nearly 40 % , in very good agreement with the bean model results plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : distortion ] .    the fig .",
    "[ fig : distortion ] includes the behaviour of @xmath70 for two different @xmath71 . comparing the two panels we see that larger indentations produce a larger @xmath1 .",
    "however , the relative excess penetration , @xmath72 is larger for the _ smaller _ indentation .",
    "the excess penetration can exceed the indentation depth by almost 50 % for @xmath73 and large values of @xmath14 . for smaller values of",
    "the creep exponent one always finds smaller @xmath1 , implying that creep tends to smoothen perturbations in the flux front.@xcite    our results demonstrate that an indentation in a thin film affects the flux distribution in a stronger and more complex way than it does in bulk superconductors .",
    "this must be due to the non - local electrodynamics of thin films , and in particular due to the presence of meissner currents in the flux free regions .",
    "these meissner currents do not make the same sharp turns as the critical currents in the flux penetrated region , see fig .",
    "[ fig : h+j ] and also refs .  .",
    "as a result , the meissner currents concentrate in front of the indentation where their density reaches @xmath8 and hence leads to even deeper flux penetration .",
    "this is why the flux front near the indentation advances faster than in the rest of the film .",
    "this accelerated advancement eventually terminates when the penetration depth becomes comparable to the strip halfwidth .",
    "the reason is simply that in the limit of full penetration all flux fronts reach the middle of the strip and hence @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath75    [ [ electric - field ] ] electric field + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the lorentz force pushing magnetic flux is directed perpendicular to the local current density .",
    "even a small indentation distorts the current stream lines over a large area , and hence significantly modifies the trajectories of flux motion .",
    "in particular , all the flux arriving to the fan - shaped region rooted at the indentation must have entered the sample through this indentation , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ybco ] .",
    "it creates a dramatic local enhancement of electric field since @xmath11 is a direct measure of the intensity of flux traffic",
    ".    analytical solution for the electric field distribution around an indentation in thin films is not available .",
    "therefore the results obtained for the case of a slab are often utilized as approximations also for films.@xcite we will now analyze to what extent such estimates are valid by comparing them with our simulation results for a strip .    in the fan - shaped region that originates from the semicircular indentation",
    ", the electric field can be found by solving the maxwell equation @xmath76 in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "since the evolution of @xmath23-distribution is usually not very far from the bean model , one can assume @xmath77 , which leads to the solution@xcite @xmath78 \\label{eq : bulk001}\\ ] ] for @xmath79 and zero for @xmath80 .",
    "far away from the indentation the solution of the same equation in cartesian coordinates , @xmath81 , is @xmath82 for @xmath83 and zero for @xmath84 .",
    "note that the width @xmath85 enters eq .",
    "( [ eq : bulk001 ] ) only because of the specific choice of the @xmath18-coordinate , where the edge is located at @xmath86 .",
    "replacement @xmath87 removes the @xmath85-dependence .",
    "@xmath88    figure  [ fig : e - profile ] compares @xmath89 and @xmath90 with the simulated electric field profiles .",
    "the quantitative agreement is poor , though the shape of profiles ( both across the indentation and away from it ) is fairly well reproduced , in agreement with ref .  .",
    "the expected enhancement of @xmath11 due to indentation is also obvious .",
    "the formulas above predict the relative enhancement for the peak values @xmath91 for a bulk sample .",
    "one can see from the plot that the effect of indentation is even stronger for thin films : the ratio @xmath92 is slightly higher and the excess penetration is larger ( the flux front here corresponds to the point where @xmath93 ) .    a locally enhanced electric field near edge indentations and hence enhanced joule heating is predicted to facilitate nucleation of a thermal instability.@xcite the instability in thin superconductors is usually observed in form of macroscopic dendritic flux avalanches@xcite or macroscopic uniform flux jumps@xcite .",
    "however , a third scenario is also possible when a series of _ microscopic _ flux avalanches repeatedly take place in the same region , each leading to a small advancement of the flux front.@xcite it creates an additional front distortion since the avalanches are expected to be larger and occur more frequently at the indentation , where the local @xmath11 is maximal .",
    "experimentally the individual avalanches can be very small , and hence it is not easy to determine whether the thermal effects contribute to an observed front distortion . to identify the penetration mechanism",
    "one can compare the observed flux profiles with the simulations .",
    "the maximal excess penetration due to non - thermal effects is found to be 150  % of the indentation radius for our parameters .",
    "consequently , when the observed excess penetration is larger , the flux penetration probably occurs via thermal micro - avalanches .",
    "we have numerically solved the maxwell equations to describe flux penetration into a thin superconducting strip with an edge - indentation and analyzed the time evolution of flux front in an increasing applied field , @xmath36 .",
    "the excess penetration , @xmath1 , due to the indentation is not equal to the indentation radius , @xmath3 , in contrast to the well - known case of a bulk superconductor in the bean model .",
    "three different mechanisms that influence the excess penetration were analyzed .",
    "( i ) the nonlocal electrodynamics in films leads to a characteristic @xmath94 dependence with a smooth peak .",
    "the ratio @xmath72 at the peak equals 1.5 when @xmath3 is 0.1 of the strip half - width and becomes even larger for smaller @xmath3 .",
    "( ii ) the flux creep always tends to smoothen the flux front and decrease the excess penetration .",
    "( iii ) thermal flux avalanches are more likely to occur at the indentation , which can increase the apparent front distortion .",
    "our results can be very helpful in order to identify which of these three mechanisms is the dominant one in a concrete experiment .",
