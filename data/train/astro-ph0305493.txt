    "stars that pass sufficiently close to a supermassive black hole will be tidally disrupted ( @xcite ) .",
    "disruption of solar - type stars occurs at a distance @xmath4 , with @xmath5 the black hole mass ; for @xmath6 , the tidal radius lies beyond the black hole s event horizon and disruption results in an energetic flare as the bound stellar debris falls back onto the black hole .",
    "emission from the debris is expected to peak in the soft x - ray or uv domains , to have a maximum luminosity of @xmath7 erg s@xmath8 , and to decay on a time scale of weeks to months ( @xcite ) .",
    "detection of flares would constitute robust proof of the existence of supermassive black holes and could conceivably allow constraints to be placed on black hole masses and spins ( @xcite ) .",
    "the _ rosat _ all - sky survey detected soft x - ray outbursts from a number of galaxies with no previous history of of seyfert activity .",
    "roughly half a dozen of these events had the properties of a tidal disruption flare ( komossa 2002 and references therein ) , and follow - up optical spectroscopy of the candidate galaxies confirmed that at least two were subsequently inactive ( @xcite ) .    the mean event rate inferred from these outbursts is roughly consistent with theoretical predictions ( @xcite ) .",
    "detailed calculations of the tidal disruption rate in samples of nearby galaxies have been published by syer & ulmer ( 1999 , hereafter su ) and magorrian & tremaine ( 1999 , hereafter mt ) .",
    "both groups took black hole masses from the magorrian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) demographic study , which found a mean ratio of black hole mass to bulge mass of @xmath9 . following the discovery of the @xmath0 relation ( @xcite ) ,",
    "the mean value of @xmath10 was revised downward , to @xmath11 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the lower mean value of @xmath10 resolved two outstanding discrepancies : the factor @xmath12 difference between black hole masses in quiescent and active galaxies with similar luminosities ( @xcite ) ; and the higher apparent density of black holes in nearby galaxies compared with what is needed to explain the integrated light from quasars ( @xcite ) .    here",
    "we examine the consequences of downwardly revised black hole masses for the rate of stellar tidal disruptions in galactic nuclei .",
    "published scaling relations ( e.g. frank & rees 1976 ; cohn & kulsrud 1978 ) suggest that stellar consumption rates in galactic nuclei should scale as @xmath13 when the other properties ( density , velocity dispersion ) of the host galaxy are fixed .",
    "hence one might naively expect the lower values of @xmath5 to imply lower rates of stellar disruption .",
    "instead we find the opposite : in most galaxies , and in particular in the galaxies with steep nuclear density profiles that dominate the overall event rate , decreasing the assumed value of @xmath5 leads to _ higher _ rates of loss cone feeding .",
    "we estimate a total tidal disruption rate among non - dwarf galaxies that is about an order of magnitude higher than in studies based on the magorrian et al .",
    "black hole masses .",
    "this paper is laid out as follows .",
    " 2 describes the galaxy sample and  3 reviews the steady - state loss cone theory from which event rates are computed .",
    "the theory is applied in  4 , with the counter - intuitive result that lower values of @xmath5 imply greater feeding rates in most galaxies .",
    "this result is analyzed in more detail in  5 , where it is shown to be a generic property of steep power - law nuclei .",
    "we derive an accurate , analytical expression for the tidal disruption rate in singular isothermal sphere nuclei . in  6 we present the implications of our results for the overall rate of tidal flaring and show that the predicted rate would be so high in dwarf galaxies that the presence of black holes in these systems could be ruled out by just a few years monitoring of a rich galaxy cluster like virgo .  7 sums up .",
    "our basic sample is the set of 61 elliptical galaxies whose surface brightness profiles were studied by faber et al .",
    "these authors fit the luminosity data to the parametric model i()=i_b2^^-(1+^)^- ,  r / r_b [ eq : nuker ] where @xmath14 is the `` break radius , '' @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the logarithmic slope of the surface brightness profile at small radii .",

    "below we follow the convention of referring to galaxies with @xmath26 as `` core '' galaxies and those with @xmath27 as `` power - law '' galaxies .",
    "we note that even most core galaxies exhibit an approximately power - law dependence of space density on radius for small @xmath28 , @xmath29 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the weak power - law dependence @xmath30 on @xmath28 in the core galaxies is not well reproduced by deprojection of the fitting function ( [ eq : nuker ] ) , which is a possible source of systematic error in what follows .",

    "the gravitational potential @xmath31 was computed via    @xmath32    the distribution function @xmath33 , defined as the number density of stars in phase space , was computed via eddington s formula : f()=_0^ with @xmath34 the stellar mass and @xmath35 .",
    "we follow mt in assuming an isotropic velocity distribution .",
    "galaxies with @xmath36 were found to have @xmath37 when @xmath38 ; this is a consequence of the fact that an isotropic @xmath33 can not reproduce a shallow density profile around a point mass .",
    "the 10 galaxies with negative @xmath33 s are included at the end of table 1 and not discussed further here .",
    "we define the sphere of influence of the black hole to have radius @xmath39 , where m_(r_h ) = 2and @xmath40 is the mass in stars within @xmath28 .",

    "masses are systematically high compared with masses computed via the @xmath0 relation .",

    "ck , who modelled globular clusters , derived expressions for these gradients by assuming that the distribution of stars near the loss cone had evolved to a steady state in which the encounter - driven supply of stars into the loss cone was balanced by consumption .",

    "however there is compelling circumstantial evidence for supermassive black holes in fainter systems ( e.g. filippenko & ho 2003 ) and less compelling evidence for intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) in starburst galaxies and star clusters ( van der marel 2003 and references therein ) .",
    "here we consider the consequences for the overall tidal flaring rate if nuclear black holes exist in galaxies fainter than m32 .",
    "the galaxies in question are the dwarf ellipticals , spheroidal systems fainter than @xmath180 ( @xcite ) . in spite of their distinct name ,",
    "de galaxies have properties that are a smooth continuation to lower luminosities of the properties of bright ellipticals ( @xcite ) .",
    "the des are the most numerous type of galaxy in the universe ; in rich galaxy clusters their numbers appear to diverge at low luminosities as @xmath181 ( @xcite ) .",
    "if de galaxies contain nuclear black holes , they would dominate the total tidal flaring rate due both to their numbers and to their high individual event rates .    rather than",
    "assume that every de contains a nuclear black hole , we make the more conservative assumption that only the nucleated des ( den s ) contain black holes .",
    "most of the den s are too distant for their central luminosity profiles to be resolved ( e.g. stiavelli et al . 2001 ) ; one exception from the local group is ngc 205 , in which the deprojected density is observed to increase as @xmath182 inward of @xmath183 pc ( l. ferrarese , private communication ) .",
    "this is similar to what is seen in the other , nucleated spheroidal systems in the local group with comparable luminosities , namely m32 and the bulges of m31 and m33 ( @xcite ) and the bulge of the milky way ( @xcite ) .",
    "we assume that all den s have nuclei with a similar structure and that den s contain nuclear black holes with the same ratio of black hole mass to total luminosity that is characteristic of brighter galaxies .",
    "we can then apply our scaling relations , equations ( [ eq : ndot1],b,[eq : us ] ) , to den galaxies .",
    "we note in passing that the luminosity profiles of the dens  a steep nucleus superposed on a shallower background profile  is just what is predicted by `` adiabatic growth '' models for black holes ( @xcite ) , although there are other possible explanations for the origin of the nuclei ( e.g. freeman 1993 ) .",
    "van den bergh ( 1986 ) plots the fraction of des that are nucleated in a sample of galaxy clusters observed by binggeli , sandage & tammann ( 1985 ) .",
    "he finds a roughly linear relation between the nucleated fraction @xmath184 and absolute magnitude : f_n-0.2(m_v+13 ) ,  -18m_v-13 .",
    "[ eq : fn ] the nucleated fraction is unity in des brighter than @xmath185 and negligible in galaxies fainter than @xmath186 .",
    "trentham & tully ( 2002 ) derive luminosity functions for the dwarf galaxy populations at the centers of six galaxy clusters including the virgo cluster .",
    "they fit their data to a schechter function , n(m_r ) dm_r = n_d(ll_d)^_d+1 e^-l / l_d dm_r [ eq : tt ] with @xmath187 the @xmath67-band absolute magnitude .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath188 has units of mpc@xmath24 and gives the surface density of de galaxies at a distance of @xmath189 kpc from the cluster center .",
    "trentham & tully find faint - end slopes of @xmath190 , consistent with earlier determinations ( e.g. sandage , binggeli & tamman 1985 ) .",
    "table 2 gives the tidal flaring rate implied by equations ( [ eq : us ] ) , ( [ eq : fn ] ) and ( [ eq : tt ] ) for the centers of the six clusters analyzed by trentham & tully ( 2002 ) .",
    "we give also an event rate for the center of the coma cluster based on the secker & harris ( 1996 ) de luminosity function .",
    "the highest events rates , @xmath191 yr@xmath2 mpc@xmath24 , are predicted for the centers of the coma and virgo clusters .",
    "these predicted event rates could be substantially increased by including the contribution from the bulges of late - type spirals , assuming the latter also contain imbhs .",
    "bulge luminosity profiles are similar to those of de galaxies ( @xcite ) and often exhibit distinct nuclei ( @xcite ) .",
    "balcells , dominguez - palmero & graham ( 2001 ) present resolved nuclear density profiles in a sample of spiral bulges observed with hst ; the nuclei are well fit by power laws with @xmath192 , similar to what is seen in the nuclei of the local group dwarves .    the event rate due to den galaxies in the virgo cluster as a whole can be computed using the determination by ferguson & sandage ( 1989 ) of the spatial distribution of the den s .",
    "they find a surface density @xmath193 , @xmath194 mpc , more centrally concentrated than the distribution of non - nucleated dwarves .",
    "using the central density normalization of trentham & tully ( 2002 ) , we find a total rate of tidal flaring due to dwarf galaxies in virgo of @xmath195 yr@xmath2 .",
    "assuming poission statistics , the probability of detecting at least one event would be @xmath196 , @xmath197 and @xmath198 after @xmath199 , @xmath200 and @xmath201 yr respectively in the virgo cluster alone . while the spatial distribution of the den galaxies in the coma cluster has apparently not been determined , we expect higher overall rates in coma than in virgo due to its greater richness .",
    "some tidal flaring models ( @xcite ) predict that single flares should persist for as long as several months or years , and inspection of the light curves of the handful of candidate x - ray events ( @xcite ) suggests decay times of this order .",
    "such long decay times would imply a non - trivial probability of observing an ongoing disruption event _ somewhere _ in the virgo or coma cluster at any given time .",
    "non - detection of @xmath202-ray flares in these clusters would constitute robust evidence that de galaxies do not harbor imbhs .",
    "\\1 . in most galaxies ,",
    "the predicted rate of stellar tidal disruptions varies inversely with assumed black hole mass .",
    "this is particularly true for galaxies with steep central density profiles , which dominate the overall event rate .",
    "the downward revision in black hole masses that followed the discovery of the @xmath0 relation implies a total flaring rate per unit volume that is about an order of magnitude higher than in earlier studies .",
    "\\3 . an accurate analytic expression ( equation [ eq : fapp ] ) can be derived that gives the tidal flaring rate as a function of black hole mass and stellar velocity dispersion in galaxies with @xmath95 nuclei .",
    "if black holes are present in nucleated spheroids fainter than @xmath180 , the tidal disruption rate due to dwarf galaxies in the virgo cluster would be of order @xmath203 yr@xmath2 .",
    "non - detection of flares after a few years of monitoring would argue against the existence of intermediate mass black holes in dwarf galaxies .",
