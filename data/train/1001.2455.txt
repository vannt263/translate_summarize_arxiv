    "according to our knowledge , gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the most powerful mysterious explosions the universe has ever seen since the big bang . with swift satellite , since november 20 , 2004 , we have a tool , which can solve the gamma - ray burst mystery .",
    "we define two samples from the swift dataset @xcite : the sample of grbs without measured redshift @xmath1 ( 189 grbs ) , and the sample with measured @xmath1 ( 97 grbs ) .",
    "the swift catalogue consists of the name of grb , its bat duration @xmath2 , bat fluence at range 15 - 150 kev , bat peak flux at range 15 - 150 kev , and redshift .",
    "the sample covers the period november 2004 - december 2007 ; the first / last event is grb041227 / grb071227 .",
    "we have studied both samples separately and also together as the whole sample ( 286 grbs ) .",
    "the first evidence about the existence of three subgroups of grbs came from the @xmath0 fitting of the durations of batse dataset @xcite .",
    "we proceed here identically .",
    "we study the whole sample and the two ones . on the x - axis",
    "there are the bins ( intervals ) of decimal log  @xmath2 , and on the y - axis there is the number of grbs in each interval .",
    "the number of bins is 10 and the bins define a histogram . we fitted the histogram .",
    "the whole sample of the grbs has 276 grbs with the measured duration .",
    "the best fit of the whole sample with one single gaussian curve gives : @xmath3 = 1.42 ( with mean @xmath2 = 26.30s ) , @xmath4 = 0.94 , @xmath0 = 53.54 .",
    "the goodness of the fit with 8 @xmath5 ( degrees of freedom ) gives the rejection on the 99.99% significance level @xcite .",
    "the fit with the sum of two gaussian curves gives : @xmath6 = -0.27 ( @xmath2(1 ) = 0.54s ) , @xmath7 = 0.94 , @xmath8 = 1.57 ( @xmath2(2 ) = 37.15s ) , @xmath9 = 0.56 , @xmath10 = 0.12 ( 12% of the grbs belongs to the short grbs ) , @xmath0 = 6.72 . here",
    "@xmath5 = 5 and we obtain an excellent fit with the significance level 50% .",
    "the fit with the sum of three gaussian curves gives : @xmath6 = 0.30 ( @xmath2(1 ) = 2.00s ) , @xmath7 = 1.27 , @xmath12 = 0.20 , @xmath8 = 0.82 ( @xmath2(2 ) = 6.61s ) , @xmath9 = 0.07 , @xmath13 = 0.12 , @xmath14 = 1.72 ( @xmath2(3 ) = 52.48 ) , @xmath15 = 0.46 , @xmath0 = 3.82 , we obtain an excellent fit for @xmath5 = 2 , because the significance level is only 78% .",
    "the decreasing of @xmath16 = 2.89 is not statistically significant @xcite , and hence the introduction of the third intermediate subgroup is not necessary .",
    "the fit is shown on the figure 3 .",
    "the sample with measured redshifts contains 94 grbs with measured duration .",
    "the best fit of the sample with one single gaussian curve gives : @xmath3 = 1.43 ( @xmath2 = 26.92s ) , @xmath4 = 0.87 , @xmath0 = 12.59 .",
    "the goodness of the fit with 8 @xmath5 does not reject the hypothesis of one single gaussian curve .",
    "the rejection is only on the 85% significance level .",
    "the fit with the sum of two gaussian curves gives : @xmath6 = -0.46 ( @xmath2(1 ) = 0.35s ) , @xmath7 = 0.51 , @xmath8 = 1.52 ( @xmath2(2 ) = 33.11s ) , @xmath9 = 0.62 , @xmath10 = 0.06 ( 6% of the grbs belongs to the short grbs ) , @xmath0 = 3.45 .",
    "here we obtain an excellent fit with the significance level 97% @xcite , thus the fit can not be rejected .",
    "the fit with the sum of three gaussian curves gives : @xmath6 = -0.71 ( @xmath2(1 ) = 0.19s ) , @xmath7 = 0.70 , @xmath12 = 0.09 , @xmath8 = 0.51 ( @xmath0(2 ) = 3.24s ) , @xmath9 = 0.01 , @xmath13 = 0.01 , @xmath14 = 1.56 ( @xmath2(3 ) = 36.31s ) , @xmath15 = 0.54 , @xmath0 = 3.16 , it is an excellent fit with @xmath5 = 2 , because the significance level is only 80% .",
    "the decreasing of @xmath16 = 0.29 is not statistically significant @xcite , also the introduction of the third intermediate subgroup is not necessary .",
    "the fit is shown on the figure 2 .",
    "the sample without measured redshifts contains 182 grbs with measured duration .",
    "the best fit of the sample with one single gaussian curve gives : @xmath3 = 1.40 ( @xmath2 = 25.12s ) , @xmath4 = 0.95 , @xmath0 = 43.23 .",

    "the fit is shown on the figure 1 .",
    "because the article @xcite described the existence of the third ( intermediate ) subgroup of grbs in the batse database by the @xmath0 fitting of the duration , we worked out an identical procedure on the existing swift database .",
    "contrary to the batse grbs ( @xcite ) , the swift grbs do not require any introduction of the third intermediate subgroup in contrast to @xcite ; the hypothesis is that the short and intermediate subgroups should form one single subclass .",
