    "with the help of galactic surveys ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , our understanding of the infrared ( ir ) energetics , morphology and evolution of supernova remnants ( snrs ) has increased substantially in the past decades . however , even at _ iras _ ( infrared astronomical satellite ) resolution , confusion with other ir sources in the galactic plane is a limiting factor that can prevent a clear picture from emerging . such confusion , for example ,",
    "can make the correct assessment of ejecta dust masses for type ii snrs difficult , a key factor for interpreting high redshift dust in the universe ( @xcite , and references therein ) . infrared emission from snrs",
    "can also provide insight into the radio - ir correlation of external galaxies @xcite .",
    "additionally , the study of dust re - emission is relevant for determining the cooling rate of snrs , an important quantity that shapes their evolution ( @xcite ) .    in this paper , we search for counterparts of snrs in the mid - infrared ( at 24 and 70 @xmath0 ) using the higher resolution _ spitzer _ data obtained with the multiband imaging photometer ( mips ) , in the coordinate ranges @xmath1 and @xmath2 , @xmath3 , complementing the work of @xcite .",
    "we also briefly explore the relation of snrs ir fluxes with other wavelength ranges , such as the radio and the x - ray .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in  [ presurv ] , we review previous galactic infrared surveys and their detection rates . in ",
    "[ emission ] , we discuss snr emission mechanisms which can contribute in the mid - infrared regime . in  [ sec : data ] , we describe the mid - infrared , radio and x - ray data used in this work . in ",
    "[ detec ] , we report the mips detections .",
    "a discussion of snr identifications , derived color ratios and radio and x - ray to infrared ratios follows in  [ discussion ] . finally , in  [ con ] , we summarize our findings .",
    "details on each detected snr can be found in the appendix .      using the galactic legacy infrared mid - plane survey extraordinaire , glimpse ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , @xcite searched the galactic plane for infrared counterparts to known snrs . out of 95 objects ,",
    "18 were clearly detected , a detection rate of about 20% .",
    "previous searches were conducted using the _ iras _ all - sky survey . within the glimpse surveyed area",
    ", @xcite obtained a detection rate of 17% and @xcite 18% ( @xcite ) . in the present study ,",
    "we identify 39 out of , i.e. , a detection rate of about 32% .",
    "the ir part of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of snrs can result from multiple sources ranging from dust ( either stochastically or thermally heated ) , atomic / molecular line emission , pah ( polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ) emission , and even synchrotron emission .",
    "in fact , the amount of the latter emission can vary substantially and is dependent on the type of remnant . in plerion remnants such as the crab nebula @xcite , it accounts for about 90% of the mid - infrared flux density ( at 25 @xmath0 ) .",
    "in contrast , about 2% of the mid - infrared flux density ( at around 25 @xmath0 ) in cas a is due to synchrotron emission @xcite .",
    "dust emission is expected to be a substantial component of the ir emission of snrs since their spectra is well fitted by one or more thermal dust populations , as revealed by previous infrared surveys ( iras ; @xcite , @xcite ) , or by stochastic heating of the grains , as proposed by @xcite to explain the mid - infrared emission from cas a. the dust is heated by charged particles in hot plasma generated by shocks ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , ) .",
    "direct evidence for the shock - heated plasma is provided by x - ray observations in the continuum , and x - ray lines are a good diagnostic of high energy interactions and abundances ( @xcite ) . while for the majority of snrs , the observed dust emission is thought to originate from the interaction of the shockwave with the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ; e.g. , , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , evidence of snrs with ejecta dust is scarce ( e.g. , @xcite ) even with the help of higher resolution ir telescopes such as _ iso _ and _ spitzer_. however , observations with the _ spitzer infrared spectrograph _ ( irs ) @xcite of the young remnant cas a have pointed to the presence of a large hot dust continuum peaking at 21 @xmath0 , from ejecta dust formed through condensation of freshly synthesized heavy elements .",
    "this component has temperatures ranging from 60 to 120 k. furthermore , recent far - infrared and sub - millimeter work ( @xcite ) on the same remnant , also suggested the existence of a ` tepid ' ( @xmath7 k ) central dust component in the ejected material ( see also ) .",
    "observational evidence for the importance of ir lines has been provided by multiple snrs spectroscopic studies which identified a plethora of lines from elements such as fe and o ( e.g. , ; @xcite ) .",
    "much of the infrared line emission seen in snrs results from the interaction of the blastwave with the surrounding environment where they are born as the shocked gas cools down .",
    "for example , ic443 is encountering an atomic region at the northeast side and a molecular cloud at the southern border ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "spectral observations by on the north of the remnant revealed that most of the emission at 12 and 25 @xmath0 , previously surveyed with iras , was in fact due to ionized line emission ( e.g. , [ fe ii ] ) with only a small contribution from dust . because optical spectra also showed strong collisionally excited fine structure atomic lines ( @xcite ) , the infrared line emission is not unexpected .",
    "likewise , for the optically bright regions in n49 , an old remnant in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , @xcite found that ir line emission can be a substantial fraction of the total ir flux , up to 80% at 24 @xmath0 . on the south of ic443 , however , the spectrum is dominated by the h@xmath8 pure rotational lines s(2 ) through s(7 ) ( ) , once again with a faint dust continuum .",
    "moreover , @xcite found a good agreement between the soft x - ray emitting plasma and the radio / optical structure on the northeastern part of the remnant where the plasma density is highest .",
    "such energetic encounters change the morphology of the neighboring ism and of the remnant itself thereby creating prominent emission lines ( e.g. , molecular hydrogen ) which can be detected in the infrared .",
    "oh masers ( in particular , the 1720 mhz line ) are also good tracers of the remnant encounter with dense molecular regions with 10% of galactic snrs showing associated masers ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the existence of infrared emission associated with pahs in snrs was first observed in a lmc remnant by @xcite . plus",
    ", evidence for such emission in some galactic snrs has also been shown through near - infrared color - color ratios by @xcite .",
    "this is likely excitation of pahs from the ism , rather than pahs from supernova dust .",
    "infrared data used in this paper originates from two spitzer surveys : glimpse using the infrared array camera ( irac ) and mipsgal ( survey of the inner galactic plane using mips , @xcite ) .",
    "both surveys cover the galactic coordinates @xmath1 and @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "the mips wavelength coverage is approximately 20 to 30 @xmath0 at ch 1 ( 24 @xmath0 ) and 50 to 100 @xmath0 at ch 2 ( 70 @xmath0 ) , thus covering a potentially rich set of diagnostic lines and dust emission features ( see fig .",
    "[ mipsfilters ] ) . in the 24 @xmath0 bandpass ,",
    "the classic [ o iv ] 25.9 and [ fe ii ] 26.0 @xmath0 tracers can be quite strong ( e.g. , ; @xcite ) , and likewise [ o  i ] 63 and [ o  iii ] 88 @xmath0 ( e.g. , @xcite ) within the 70 @xmath0 bandpass . other standard shock excitation tracers , like [ ne  ii ] 12.81 or [ si ii ] 34.8 @xmath0 , are unfortunately not included within the irac or mips bandpasses .",
    "nevertheless , when dust is present , it is the dominant component of the ir radiation at 24 and 70 @xmath0 ( see fig .  [ mipsfilters ] ) .",
    "although the 24 @xmath0 data delivered by the spitzer science center in their post - bcd products are of a very high quality , the mipsgal pipeline was designed to enhance the data a step further .",
    "the details are described in @xcite , but briefly the pipeline : ( 1 ) carefully deals with saturated and non - saturated data , a key issue in the galactic plane ; ( 2 ) removes a series of artifacts , the most common being a column - to - column jailbar striping , plus ( 3 ) that of short - duration afterimage latencies , ( 4 ) long - duration responsivity variations , and ( 5 ) background mismatches .",
    "the mipsgal observations were designed to be a 24 @xmath0 survey as the high background levels of the galactic plane at longer wavelengths saturated the 160 @xmath0 detectors and placed the 70 @xmath0 at a fluence level not well characterized . since mips takes data simultaneously at 70 and 160 @xmath0 , and that at 70 @xmath0 at first sight looks reasonable , then a concerted effort has been invested by the mipsgal team to improve its quality .",
    "the specific steps of the 70 @xmath0 pipeline are described in paladini et al .",
    "( _ in preparation ) _ , but the main issue is to mitigate the effect of the non - linear response of the ge : ga photoconducting detectors .",
    "their standard behavior leads to striping of the images , sudden jumps in brightness and a large uncertainty in the calibration for bright sources and regions .",
    "the mipsgal 70 @xmath0 pipeline reduces these effects and decreases the calibration uncertainties to a level of @xmath915@xmath10 .",
    "this uncertainty on the absolute calibration of the extended emission is consistent with that determined by the mips team in their calibration at 24 and 70 @xmath0 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the adopted uncertainty in calibration for mips 24 @xmath0 is 10% . for the 70 @xmath0 fluxes ,",
    "the main errors come from uncertainties in the background estimation and calibration errors ( we adopt a conservative value of 20% ) .",
    "moreover , we have used the 24 @xmath0 point source subtracted data . for details in the point source removal procedure",
    "see shenoy et al .",
    "( _ in preparation)_. point source sensitivities are 2 and 75 mjy ( 3@xmath11 ) at 24 and 70 @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the resolution of the 24 @xmath0 data is @xmath12 while for 70 @xmath0 it is @xmath13 .      at the irac bands ( @xcite , in particular fig .",
    "2 ) one expects to find a wealth of atomic lines , including br@xmath14 ( 4.05 @xmath0 ) , pf@xmath15 ( 4.65 @xmath0 ) , [ fe  ii ] ( 5.34 @xmath0 ) , and [ ar  ii ] ( 8.99 @xmath0 ) , among others , plus the molecular s(13 ) through s(4 ) h@xmath16 rotational lines , and co transitions at 4 - 5 @xmath0 .",
    "this is very much the case in ic 443 ( @xcite ; ) .",
    "we use primarily the 8 @xmath0 images from irac .",
    "occasionally , other channels are also used in order to constrain the possible emission mechanisms .",
    "the 4.5 @xmath0 channel provides a valuable diagnostic of shocked molecular gas ( e.g. , @xcite ) . at these wavelengths",
    ", our measured flux represents an upper limit since star contamination is present .",
    "we adopt a conservative value of 10% for the calibration error given the vagaries in color correction plus measurement errors .",
    "the irac sampling is @xmath17 but the 8 @xmath0 resolution is about @xmath18 .",
    "most of the supernova remnants in green s catalog @xcite are discovered using radio observations . by comparing the emission in at least two different radio wavelengths ,",
    "one can calculate the spectral index and thus distinguish the kind of emission produced ( thermal or non - thermal ) . in the case of snrs",
    ", we expect to find a spectral index which is characteristic of synchrotron radiation .",
    "in contrast , regions show a flat spectrum ( when optically thin ) which is indicative of free - free emission .",
    "the snr radio emission is associated with regions where shock - induced particle acceleration take place within the source .",
    "in addition to data in green s catalog , the following radio data sets are used for comparison with the infrared images : vla ( very large array ) archival data at 20 and 90 cm , available from the multi - array galactic plane imaging survey ( magpis ; @xcite ) website , vgps ( vla galactic plane survey ; @xcite ) at 21 cm and most ( mongolo observatory synthesis telescope ; ) at about 36 cm .    wide band ( 300 - 10000 ev ) x",
    "- ray images from the _ chandra _ supernova remnant catalog archive are also used for comparison .",
    "x - ray emission locates the shock heated plasma , including the important reverse shock in the interior region .",
    "to describe the amount of ( or lack of ) infrared emission from snrs in our sample , we use a similar classification scheme to the one adopted by @xcite .",
    "detection levels are characterized as follows : ( 1 ) detected , ( 2 ) possible detection , ( 3 ) unlikely detection and ( 4 ) not detected ( see table [ table : level ] ) . level 1 detections have a good positional match between the infrared contours and those at other energies ( radio or x - ray ) .",
    "level 2 detections display infrared emission within the remnant region but confused with cirrus or nearby regions .",
    "level 3 detections show the presence of some infrared emission which does not seem to be correlated with the remnant , although source confusion prevents a clear assessment of the emission origin .",
    "level 4 is characterized by the absence of infrared emission within or nearby the contours of the radio remnant .    out of a sample of   possible radio remnants ,",
    "are level 1 detections , a detection rate of 32% compared to 18% with glimpse",
    ". a few examples of level 1 detections are shown in fig .",
    "[ good ] . the mipsgal sensitivity at 24 @xmath0 matches very well that of irac at 8 @xmath0 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the fact that we can identify many more snrs than with irac could potentially be due to an extinction effect ( lower at 24 @xmath0 than at 8 @xmath0 by 40@xmath10 , ) .",
    "however , it is far more plausible that it could simply be the details of how snrs emit . in the case of snrs",
    "interacting with the ism where shocks modify the dust grain size distribution ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , 24 @xmath0 continuum emission ( due to very small grains , vsgs ) rises while at 8 @xmath0 the emission by stochastically heated pahs is not as strong .",
    "we calculate flux densities at 8 , 24 , and 70 @xmath0 for snrs which show obvious infrared counterparts ( level 1 detections ) .",
    "the aperture size used for the flux derivations is , in some cases , different from the one listed at radio wavelengths ( see table [ table:1 ] ) .",
    "this is done in order to account for the different morphologies a remnant can have in various wavelength ranges .",
    "furthermore , there are cases where the snr is nearby other unrelated extended galactic sources whose contamination can lead to an overestimate of the infrared flux ( e.g. , diffuse galactic emission and regions ) . to avoid such problems ,",
    "we examined the mips images overlaid with contours from other wavelengths to help constrain the location and shape of the snr infrared emission ; however , such discrimination is not always well achieved .",
    "another issue that arises , especially when dealing with galactic plane images such as these , is the presence of unrelated infrared emission along the line of sight . this confusion can hinder the detection of snrs as demonstrated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "flux densities of the detected remnants were obtained using either a circular or elliptical aperture with a background removed .",
    "the background was determined using the median value of the sky brightness around the remnant via two methods .",
    "we used an annulus around the source for cases where the external source contamination in the neighborhood is negligible .",
    "however , that method was often not feasible due to considerable overlap of sources ( extended or point - like ) with the periphery of the snr . for those cases ,",
    "the sky brightness was estimated with a user - selected region characteristic of the local background emission . in order to quantify the magnitude of background variations , we measured the surface brightness on several regions around one of the faintest 24@xmath0  snr , g21.8 - 0.6 .",
    "we used aperture sizes similar to the one used for the remnant and found that the standard deviation relative to the mean background value across the field , for our three wavelengths are of the order of 12% ( 8 @xmath0 ) , 10% ( 24 @xmath0 ) and 20% ( 70 @xmath0 ) .",
    "another consideration for photometry measurements is point source contamination , especially at 8 @xmath0 ( as discussed in   [ glimpse ] ) . finally , since we are dealing with spatially extended emission , we applied corrections to the 8 @xmath0 estimates to account for internal scattering in the detectors as instructed by the irac data handbook .",
    "the ` infinite ' radius aperture is most appropriate for the angular extent of the remnants ; we multiplied the surface brightness measurements by 0.74 .",
    "out of the previous 18 detections ( level 1 ) using glimpse @xcite , we confirm 16 at the same level with mipsgal ( table  1 ) .",
    "the remaining two remnants are confused with the background and are reported as possible detections in our analysis . of the other 23 ( level 1 ) infrared counterparts found in this work , 10 are not in the initial sample from green s catalog used by @xcite and the remaining 13 are mostly bright x - ray remnants which seem to be brighter at 24 @xmath0",
    ". regarding the snrs identified by @xcite , all of their level 1 detections are also seen in mipsgal with the exception of g12.0 - 0.1 and g54.1 + 0.3 which are both level 3 in the mips data . comparing with @xcite ,",
    "six snrs have been detected in common ( level 1 ) .",
    "they also reported a level 1 detection of 8 others , which we classify as level 2 or 3 .",
    "again , we observe that these cases are mostly regions where there is a large contamination by nearby or overlapping regions making a clear identification challenging even at the superior spitzer resolution .      given the strong ambient emission in the inner galactic plane , it is not surprising that many snrs , either too big or too old , and having low infrared surface brightness , do not have an identifiable infrared signature .",
    "also , as noted by @xcite , the environs in which snrs are encountered need to be sufficiently dense to promote collisional heating of the dust , thus making it distinguishable .",
    "examples of non - detections in this survey are g18.1 - 0.1 and g299.6 - 0.5 .",
    "table  [ table:1 ] shows flux densities ( at 8 , 24 and 70 @xmath0 ) and color ratios for the detected remnants .",
    "figure [ colorplotflux ] contains a logarithmic plot of [ f@xmath4/f@xmath19 _ versus _ [ f@xmath6/@xmath5 for which snrs are detected as a whole ( see last column of table  [ table:1 ] ) .",
    "two other snrs are plotted : for cas a , values are retrieved from @xcite and for ic443 from noriega - crespo et al .  _ ( in preparation)_. the data show a linear trend with a slope of @xmath20 : remnants with a low [ f@xmath4/f@xmath19 ratio statistically have a low [ f@xmath6/f@xmath19 ratio .",
    "furthermore , there seems to exist an age effect , with older remnants ( such as ic443 and w44 ) showing higher [ f@xmath6/f@xmath19 and [ f@xmath4/f@xmath19 .",
    "the opposite seems to be more characteristic of younger remnants , such as cas a , kes 73 and g11.2 - 0.3 .    in some remnants , infrared emission",
    "is only detected in certain parts inside the radio / x - ray contours .",
    "figure  [ colorplot ] shows surface brightness ratios of these localized regions . to assess the mechanism of the infrared emission , we also calculate surface brightnesses for regions of snrs known to be either interacting with neighboring molecular regions ( such as the bml region in 3c391 ) and/or that show molecular emission lines ( such as w49b ) or known to have ionic lines ( such as 3c396 ) . for this exercise",
    ", we used regions of some remnants for which the main emission mechanism had previously been identified by @xcite ( see their fig .",
    "these are also identified in the snr figures in the appendix .",
    "remnants with colors characteristic of ionic shocks seem to occupy the lower left part of the [ i@xmath6/i@xmath19 versus [ i@xmath4/i@xmath19 diagram , while remnants whose colors are consistent with molecular shocks and photodissociation regions are found in the upper right part .",
    "however , given the small number of examples and the fact that all three passbands ( 8 , 24 and 70 @xmath0 ) contain dust emission and lines , we suggest that the [ i@xmath6/i@xmath19 and [ i@xmath4/i@xmath19 color ratios are not a completely secure method of distinguishing between different emission mechanisms .",
    "we plot some other color ratios for comparison .",
    "the locus for pure synchrotron is for spectral index of 0.3 to 1 .",
    "is the spectral index and the radio flux density is defined as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the frequency . ] for the diffuse ism , we used the color ratios obtained by @xcite for two regions ( with different abundances of very small grains ) in the galactic plane at a longitude of approximately @xmath23 .",
    "we have also included color ratios for evolved regions ( found near galactic longitudes of @xmath24 ; paladini et al .  _",
    "( in preparation ) _ ) .",
    "are the color ratios [ f@xmath6/@xmath5 and [ f@xmath4/f@xmath19 good discriminators between such very different regions ?",
    "based on figure [ colorplot ] , the plotted colors of individual evolved regions often seem indistinguishable from snrs using spitzer colors",
    ". however , the overall trend for snrs is displaced from the regions and covers a broader range of colors .",
    "this is similar to what @xcite found for older snrs and compact regions using iras colors .",
    "although line contamination is significant for radiative remnants , for younger ones the majority of the ir emission should be due to dust grains .",
    "for instance , for rcw 103 ( age approximately 2000 yr ; @xcite ) we calculate the ratio of line emission ( using iso data ) versus dust continuum within mips filters .",
    "we find that line emission contributes about 6% and 3% of the observed flux at 24 and 70 @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "if emission from the remnants comes primarily from shocked hot dust , then we can derive the dust temperature just by assuming a simple modified blackbody emission .",
    "if dust has a thermal spectral energy distribution @xmath25 where @xmath15 is the dust emissivity index ( which depends on the dust composition , @xmath26 to 2 ) , then flux ratios imply certain temperatures .",
    "figure [ colorplotflux ] shows temperatures based on the [ f@xmath4/@xmath5 and [ f@xmath27/@xmath28 ratios . the latter flux ratio yields dust temperatures for our snr sample ranging between 45 and 70 k for @xmath29 and from 50 to 85 k for @xmath30 .",
    "this is a very crude estimate of the dust temperature given that we are just considering one population of dust grains in temperature equilibrium when it is far more likely that there are several populations plus non - equilibrium emission . applying the same simple dust model to the [ f@xmath4/@xmath5 ratio , we obtain temperature values higher than 145 k ( for @xmath29 ) with younger snrs having color temperatures lower that older remnants .",
    "this trend is similar to what was obtained by @xcite using color temperatures based on the iras 12 to 25 @xmath0 ratio .",
    "the infrared colors are not well explained by a single equilibrium dust temperature and atomic and molecular line emission as well as pahs might significantly contribute to the infrared emission for snrs .",
    "however , assuming that the infrared emission at 24 and 70 @xmath0 is cospatial , entirely due to dust , and well fitted by a single temperature modified blackbody , then snr dust masses are given by the following equation : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the distance to each snrs , @xmath33 is the flux density and @xmath34 is the dust mass absorption coefficient . for the dust mass absorption coefficient",
    ", we use the diffuse ism model by @xcite which consists of a mixture of amorphous silicate and carbonaceous grains .",
    "distances are retrieved from green s catalog .",
    "results are reported in table  [ mass ] .",
    "note that these derived dust masses , based on the 24 and 70 @xmath0 fluxes from mips , are overestimated given the probable contamination of these fluxes by line emission which can be substantial in radiative remnants . even in the case",
    "where all of the flux in these bands is due to dust , mass estimates are based on a single color temperature ( 24/70 ) which can be reasonable for younger remnants but not ideal for older remnants given that their ir sed generally requires more that one dust population ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .      according to @xcite ,",
    "the comparison between mid - infrared ( 60 @xmath0 from iras ) and radio continuum ( 11 cm ) emission is a good diagnostic for distinguishing between thermal from non - thermal radio emitters ( see also and @xcite ) .",
    "regions are shown to have infrared to radio ratios of the order of @xmath35 while ratios for snrs are thought to be lower than 20 . moreover , using most found that snrs have a ratio of infrared ( 60 @xmath0 ) to radio ( 843 mhz or 36 cm ) of @xmath36 while regions have again ratios of the order of 500 or more .",
    "we use the 1 ghz flux densities provided in green s catalog @xcite .",
    "those values were converted to 1.4 ghz ( 21 cm ) flux densities using the spectral indices quoted in the same catalog .",
    "we compare those to the 24 and 70 @xmath0 emission from mipsgal .",
    "figure  [ radio_infrared ] shows the spread in the ratio of the infrared to radio for the detected snrs .",
    "note that these ratios are often defined by @xmath37 where f@xmath38 and f@xmath39 are the flux densities ( in jy ) at specific mid - infrared wavelengths and in the radio .",
    "there seems to be a group with ratios ( or high @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) similar to those of regions . in particular , we suggest that the morphology of the remnant g23.6 + 0.3 ( and possibly g14.3 + 0.1 ) resembles more closely an region and",
    "so whether it is a snr should be re - considered .",
    "see also its infrared colors compared to regions ( figs .",
    "[ colorplotflux ] and [ colorplot ] ) .",
    "image in figure [ snrg236 - 03 ] ( and [ snrg14301 ] ) clearly shows a composite infrared emission , with the 24 @xmath0 ( probing hot and small particles ) matching the radio , while the 8 and 70 @xmath0 emission do not spatially coincide with the 24 @xmath0",
    ". in particular , the 8 @xmath0 appears as an outer layer which marks the transition between the ionized region and colder gas .",
    "the 70 @xmath0 emission is also seen along the same location as the 8 @xmath0 , which is consistent with the premise that we are now probing a colder dust population .",
    "there is a strong empirical correlation between infrared and radio emission ( at 1.4 ghz ) found in spiral galaxies @xcite . the radio emission in this range is thought to be mainly due to synchrotron emission with only 10% is attributed to thermal bremsstrahlung produced by regions ( @xcite and references therein ) . in our galaxy and other local star forming galaxies , the bulk of the mid and far - infrared arises from warm dust associated with star forming regions . in older systems , things are more complicated due to cold cirrus and evolved stars ( e.g. , agbs ) .",
    "we look for a similar correlation using the infrared and radio emission from our snr sample .",
    "we estimate the mid - infrared emission as the sum of the integrated emission in each mips passband ( 24 and 70 @xmath0 ) and obtain an integrated mid - infrared flux f@xmath42 in units of w / m@xmath43 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the f@xmath42 is an approximation ( underestimate ) of the mid - infrared bolometric flux ( given that the bandpasses of 24 and 70 @xmath0 filters do not overlap ) .",
    "figure  [ helou_82470 ] shows the correlation between infrared and 1.4 ghz non - thermal radio flux .",
    "the slope of the correlation is @xmath44 when combining all data ( plus ic443 ) .",
    "again , two distinct populations seem to exist , an upper main trend and a lower one . using only the lower one ( i.e. , objects which have 70 @xmath0 to 1.4 ghz ratios closer to regions and high values of @xmath40 and @xmath41 in fig .",
    "[ radio_infrared ] ) , we obtain a slope of @xmath45 while for the upper trend we get @xmath46 .",
    "the correlation with the slope fixed to unity leads to the dimensionless parameter @xmath47 ( @xcite ) which represents the ratio of mid - infrared to radio and is defined as @xmath48    our results show that remnants from the lower trend population in figure  [ helou_82470 ] have @xmath47 larger than 2.06 ( up to 2.60 ) .",

    "a previous study by @xcite reported a median value of @xmath50 ( i.e. , the ratio of the total 8 - 1000 @xmath0 ir luminosity to the radio power ) of @xmath51 for a sample of 162 galaxies . but",
    "note this would be higher because it is based on the total ir emission .",
    "table  [ table : qlambda ] reports on the average and dispersion of the monochromatic @xmath52 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 parameters for the two trends . for comparison ,",
    "a study of extragalactic vla radio sources by @xcite obtained @xmath53 and @xmath54 while @xcite found @xmath55 for somewhat fainter galaxies . later on , @xcite using akari data for some lmc snrs compared the ratio of 24 @xmath0 to radio fluxes ; their correlation implies @xmath56 . if snrs are the sole contributors of synchrotron emission in a star - forming galaxy , then by comparison with the above @xmath40 s for galaxies they concluded that about 4 to 14% of the 24 @xmath0 emission in galaxies is due to snrs .",
    "by doing a similar exercise using the upper trend remnants , for which @xmath57 ( see table  [ table : qlambda ] ) , we find that 10 to 35% of the 24 @xmath0 galactic emission seen would be due to the remnants . likewise , at 70 @xmath0 that contribution would be 11% .",
    "the rest would be due to dust heated in and photo - dissociation regions , as well as diffuse emission .      in this section",
    ", we explore the relationship between the infrared and x - ray energetics of snrs .",
    "shocks produce hot plasma whose thermal energy is transferred to the dust grains via collisions and then re - emitted in the infrared ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . heating up the dust grains takes energy from the x - ray gas , thus cooling it and a good tool to measure this transfer of energy is the ratio of infrared to x - ray power , usually referred to as irx @xcite , which compares dust cooling ( gas - grain collisions ) with x - ray cooling ( continuum and lines ) .",
    "the gas cooling function increases at lower plasma temperatures given that more lines become available due to recombination .",
    "on the other hand , at high temperatures of around @xmath58 k , most of the energy is released through the bremsstrahlung continuum ( @xcite ) .",
    "assuming that line emission in the infrared is not energetically significant compared to the x - ray lines , then most of the line cooling must happen in the x - ray domain .",
    "this implies that if the observed powers in the infrared and x - ray are comparable then dust must be the essential contributor to the cooling in the infrared .",
    "table  [ table : xray ] shows the values of irx for a sample of snrs .",
    "the total x - ray fluxes ( with energy range from 0.3 to 10 kev ) were retrieved from the _ chandra _ supernova remnant catalog . infrared flux densities ( in jy ) were measured for regions approximately matching those in the x - ray .",
    "we obtain the ir flux by integrating under the sed using simple linear interpolation in log space plus @xmath22f@xmath22 constant across the 24 @xmath0 passband .",
    "also , note that the flux densities used in this analysis are not corrected for extinction . for our sample ,",
    "irxs range from about 1.6 for remnant rcw103 to 240 for w44 .",
    "+ these data are presented as seds in figure  [ figxray ] , in the logarithmic form @xmath59 vs. @xmath60 which is convenient for assessing the energetics .",
    "the radio values are obtained from green s catalog ( @xcite ) .",
    "we also include cas a and ic443 for comparison .",
    "their infrared flux densities are taken from @xcite and noriega - crespo et al .",
    "( _ in preparation _ ) while the x - ray fluxes are from the chandra supernova remnant catalog and @xcite , respectively . in figure  [ figxray ]",
    "the remnants are sorted according to increasing age ( see table  [ table : xray ] ) .",
    "although the ages for some remnants are uncertain , this figure shows that hot dust grain cooling ( 24 @xmath0 ) tends to be the most important contributor in early phases of the remnant , while in the later stage the warm dust traced by the 70 @xmath0 emission is the main contributor to plasma cooling .",
    "it also appears that older remnants tend to have greater irxs .",
    "this can potentially be either due to an increase in the dust - to - gas ratio and/or a change in the size distribution favoring smaller sizes .",
    "we have compiled a catalog of snrs detected within the mipsgal survey at 24 and 70 @xmath0 , with complementary measurements at 8 @xmath0 from the glimpse survey . in order to better assess the nature of the detected infrared emission , we have compared it with radio and x - ray data .",
    "our main findings are the following :    * the detection rate of snrs given the mipsgal sensitivity is 32@xmath10 , 39 out of the 121 candidates from green s snr catalog and higher than any previous infrared survey .",
    "* we find a linear trend ( slope @xmath61 ) in the logarithmic relationship between [ f@xmath4/f@xmath19 versus [ f@xmath6/@xmath5 .",
    "if there is indeed an age effect , then the youngest snrs will have the lowest [ f@xmath4/f@xmath19 and [ f@xmath6/f@xmath19 ratios . *",
    "the [ i@xmath6/i@xmath19 and [ i@xmath4/i@xmath19 color ratios provide a method of distinguishing between different emission mechanisms .",
    "this is not completely secure and the color ratios of some snrs overlap with those of regions . * assuming a simple modified blackbody model ( at 24 and 70 @xmath0 ) , we retrieve snrs dust temperatures which range from 45 to 70 k for a dust emissivity of @xmath29 . * using the previous color temperature ( t@xmath62 ) , we find rough estimates of dust masses ranging from 0.02 to 2.5 m@xmath63 .",
    "note that the dust masses obtained here may be overestimated given the possible contribution of line emission to the mips fluxes .",
    "* we also compare infrared fluxes with their corresponding radio fluxes at 1.4 ghz and find that most of the remnants have ratios of 70 @xmath0 to 1.4 ghz characteristic of snrs , although six ( about 18% of the detected sample ) have ratios closer to those found for regions . * the slope of the logarithmic correlation between",
    "` total ' mid - infrared flux ( 24 and 70 @xmath0 ) and the 1.4 ghz non - thermal radio flux is close to unity ( 1.10 ) as found for galaxies .",
    "@xmath47 values were calculated for each fully detected remnant and they range between approximately 0.06 and 2.60 .",
    "* whether the strong 24 @xmath0 emission is the result of line emission or hot dust , it is clear that there is a good morphological association of the 24 @xmath0 and x - ray features in bright x - ray remnants .",
    "the mechanism for the 24 @xmath0 emission for these remnants is most likely grains heated by collisions in the hot plasma .",
    "the morphology of this mid - infrared emission is also generally distinct from the other infrared wavelengths which implies that the emission at 8 and 70 @xmath0 has a different origin .",
    "* we present seds ( radio , infrared , x - ray ) for a sample of remnants and show that the energy released in the infrared is comparable to the cooling in the x - ray range",
