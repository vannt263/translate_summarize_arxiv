    "the cosmological origin of grb has by now been firmly established following the discovery of their afterglows and the determination of their redshifts @xcite and the launch of _ swift _ which increased the number of observed afterglows and redshift determinations .",
    "these developments left little doubt that grb emission is intimately associated with relativistic blast waves ( rbw ) , as proposed by @xcite and at the same time shifted the focus of the study from the prompt grb emission to its afterglow @xcite .",
    "the early , sparsely sampled grb afterglow light curves , were fit well with simple power law functions , appropriate to emission from either spherical @xcite or jet - like @xcite rbw .",
    "however , the launch of _ swift _ with its prompt , continuous , broad frequency coverage has provided new unexpected ( and unexplained ) details of the afterglow light curves .",
    "chief amongst them are : ( a ) an early afterglow steep decrease of the flux ( @xmath3 to @xmath4 ) followed often by a period of constant flux ( before its eventual power law decline ) in many bursts .",
    "( b ) large flares in the x - ray light curves @xmath5 sec after the beginning of the event ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for more details ) .",
    "these were compounded to the already open problems of the prompt emission , namely : ( c ) the grb  inner engine \" .",
    "( d ) the non - dissipative transport of the grb energy to the emission region and , most importantly , its efficient dissipation there .",
    "( e ) the physics behind the characteristic energy of peak grb emission , @xmath6 and its narrow distribution within the class of the classic grb @xcite .",
    "( f ) the physics that relate grb to xrr ( x - ray rich bursts ) and xrf ( x - ray flashes ) , transients of lower flux and lower @xmath6 , recorded by broad band missions such as _ bepposax _ , _ hete _ and _ swift _ ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    ".    of the above problems , ( a ) has received no apparent resolution while ( b ) is loosely attributed to continued activity at the  inner engine \" ; while not implausible , this demands activity over time scales almost @xmath7 times longer than the characteristic time associated with the  inner engine \" dynamics ( @xmath8 sec ) , as the latter is thought related to stellar collapse .",
    "( d ) is considered to be effected either through protons ( e.g * ? ? ? * ) or magnetic fields @xcite , however , the necessary and efficient dissipation  is one of the least studied aspects of grb \" @xcite ; this issue is generally approached by parameterizing the energy density in relativistic electrons to be a given fraction ( typically @xmath9 ) of that of protons .",
    "issue ( e ) is generally open , given the absence of an underlying reason for such a characteristic energy .",
    "monte carlo simulations of a large number of models @xcite failed to reproduce the narrow width of the observed distribution because of the large number of parameters involved and/or because of the lack of strong dependence of @xmath6 on any single parameter .",
    "finally , there are a number of proposals concerning ( f ) @xcite , which appear plausible but without a single one of them universally agreed upon .    the  supercritical pile \" model ( spm ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth kgm02 and mk06 ) , adapted from agn @xcite , has been introduced to provide a resolution to ( d ) .",
    "the compelling arguments in favor of the spm are : ( 1 ) _ its economic _ ( non - thermal particles not necessary ) , _ efficient conversion of the rbw relativistic proton energy into photons _ through a radiative instability akin to that of a supercritical nuclear pile .",
    "( 2 ) _ its spectra which exhibit a characteristic value for @xmath10 _ mev ( in the lab frame ) irrespective of the rbw lorentz factor @xmath1 , in agreement with observation @xcite , _ produced as  unintended consequence \" of the dissipation process_. crucial in addressing these issues has been the presence of an upstream medium which scatters the rbw photons ( a  mirror \" ) and allows them to be re - intercepted by the rbw , while boosted in energy by @xmath11 .",
    "in mk06 we have explored numerically the spm assuming a constant lorentz factor @xmath1 for the rbw , confirmed the efficiency of proton energy conversion into to radiation and the presence of a well defined value for @xmath6 , reflecting the kinematic threshold of the reaction @xmath12 .",
    "the present treatment is far more realistic : ( a ) it computes the evolution of the rbw lorentz factor @xmath1 through a medium of density @xmath13 , thought to represent the wind of a wr star , including also the effects of the radiative drag of the bulk - comptonized photons .",
    "( b ) replaces the upstream  mirror \" required by the model by scattering the rbw photons in this medium .",
    "the combination of these effects can result in a rich grb time evolution , but we presently restrict ourselves to a specific example of a grb light curve , deferring the broader exploration of other models to a future publication . despite this limited scope , we can reproduce some of the salient features of the grb in the afterglow evolution , such as their steep decrease in flux following the termination of their prompt phase , an effect traceable in this specific case to the kinematic threshold of the model .    in  2 we provide the general framework of our model with emphasis on its novel aspects compared to previous treatments . in ",
    "3 we present the results of our calculations and finally in  4 the results are summarized and conclusions are drawn .",
    "we consider a relativistic blast wave ( rbw ) of speed @xmath14 and lorentz factor @xmath1 .",
    "its radius @xmath15 is measured from the center of the original explosion and it is sweeping up the circumstellar medium ( csm ) of density @xmath16 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath1 as a function of radius is given by the combination of the conservation laws of mass @xmath17 and energy - momentum @xmath18 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath19 is the radiation emission rate as measured in the comoving frame and @xmath20 is the radiation drag force exerted on the rbw by any radiation field exterior to the flow . given that the rbw velocity @xmath21 is very close to the speed of light @xmath22 , the entire radiative history of the rbw lies just ahead of it at a distance @xmath23 ; therefore , isotropization of this radiation by scattering in the ambient medium ( the action of the  mirror \" ) will lead to its re - interception by the rbw to thus contribute to @xmath20 .",
    "this is given by the expression @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the rbw thomson depth , @xmath26 the csm electron density and @xmath27 the thomson cross section . in the above expression , two powers of @xmath1",
    "are due to the increase of the photon energy density upon its scattering on the  mirror \" while the other two to the usual radiative loss rate ( an analogous term due to the @xmath28 reaction was found to increase @xmath20 by 20% for the specific parameter values discussed herein but it maybe more important for different values ) .",
    "the calculation of the @xmath19 and @xmath29 terms is done by implementing the numerical code used in mk06 to compute the radiation of the spm .",
    "this is done be solving the simultaneous equations @xmath30 the unknown functions @xmath31 are the differential number densities of protons , electrons and photons while the index @xmath32 can be any one of the subscripts ` p ' , ` e ' or ` @xmath33 ' referring to each species . the operators @xmath34 denote losses or escape of each species from the system while @xmath35 denote injection and source terms of each species by each of a number of processes which are described in detail in mk06 .",
    "the above equations are solved in the fluid frame in a spherical volume of radius @xmath36 .",
    "this can be justified by the fact that due to relativistic beaming an observer receives the radiation coming mainly from a small section of the rbw of lateral width @xmath37 and longitudinal width @xmath38 in the lab but @xmath37 on the comoving frame .",
    "the present treatment differs from that of mk06 in two important aspects :    \\(1 ) hot protons accumulate continuously on the rbw as it sweeps the csm .",
    "this then sets the source terms of the protons ( @xmath39 ) and electrons ( @xmath40 ) ( with units particles / energy / volume / time ) to @xmath41 and @xmath42 i.e. we assume that at each radius @xmath43 the rbw picks up an equal amount of electrons and protons from the circumstellar medium which have , upon injection , energies @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively . consequently , the proton _ energy _ injection rate is given by @xcite @xmath46 while a fraction @xmath47 of the above goes to electrons .",
    "\\(2 ) the scattering of the rbw photons takes place on the csm ahead of the advancing rbw ( rather than an _ ad hoc _ mirror ) and , as such , its photon scattering column is uniquely determined by the initial conditions and , like all other parameters is a function of time ( or equivalently position ) .",
    "( [ mass ] ) , ( [ energy ] ) , ( [ continuity ] ) , along with eqns .",
    "( [ rad ] ) , ( [ qp ] ) and ( [ qe ] ) form a set which can be solved to yield simultaneously the evolution of the rbw dynamics and luminosity .",
    "this approach is self - consistent in that the ` hot ' mass injected through equations ( [ qp ] ) and ( [ qe ] ) shows up at rhs of eqn .",
    "( [ mass ] ) , while the radiated luminosity @xmath19 feedbacks onto the energy - momentum equation through the definition of the radiative force , @xmath20 , of eqn .",
    "( [ rad ] ) .",
    "the free parameters of this system are ( i ) the total energy of the explosion @xmath48 ( ii ) the csm density profile @xmath49 ( iii ) the magnetic field as a function of radius @xmath50 . to avoid computation of the evolution during the rbw acceleration phase when it likely produces little radiation , we have chosen to begin our calculations ( and the accumulation of matter by the rbw ) at a radius @xmath51",
    "at which is has already achieved its asymptotic lorentz factor @xmath52 .    -12pt",
    "-12pt    as proposed in kgm02 and shown explicitly in mk06 , the relativistic protons accumulated in the rbw can become supercritical to the network of @xmath53 once kinematic and dynamic thresholds are simultaneously fulfilled .",
    "the kinematic threshold simply reflects the kinematic threshold of the @xmath54 reaction and reads @xmath55 with the latter expression for b - field in equipartition , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the critical magnetic field .",
    "the dynamic threshold provides the critical column density for the accumulated relativistic protons to become supercritical ( in a fashion analogous to a nuclear pile ) and , if fulfilled , a large fraction of the energy stored in relativistic protons is converted into e@xmath58e@xmath59-pairs within a few light travel times across the width of the shock .    at the earliest stages of the rbw evolution",
    "the accumulated relativistic proton column is small and little emission is possible , only that of the swept - up electrons , which is smaller than the energy flux through the shock by a factor @xmath47 and may very well represent the oft quoted grb precursor emission .",
    "the eventual evolution of the rbw depends on whether its asymptotic lorentz factor @xmath60 and @xmath61field satisfy the kinematic threshold ( eqn .",
    "[ thres1 ] ) .",
    "if not , and in the absence of an accelerated population of particles , only the energy flux in electrons is converted to radiation and the grb is a  dud \" , as the combination @xmath62 is only expected to decrease with radius ( however an explosive release is still possible if the proton distribution includes an accelerated power law component that extends to @xmath63 ; as hinted in @xcite , these events may be related to the xrrs and xrfs ) .",
    "far more interesting is the case where the kinematical criterion is satisfied initially . then whether the flow becomes radiatively unstable depends on the column of hot protons accumulated on the rbw",
    "when this exceeds the critical value , the energy contained in relativistic protons is explosively released , the value of @xmath20 increases dramatically and the lorentz factor @xmath1 of the rbw can decrease over a distance @xmath64 , provided that the second term in eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) is dominant .",
    "this drop in @xmath1 is important not only for decreasing the emitted flux but , more significantly , for potentially pushing @xmath62 below its kinematic threshold value @xmath65 , ( as is the case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) , a fact that according to the spm marks the end of the prompt grb emission phase , i.e. the conversion of proton energy into radiation . following this event ,",
    "radiation is emitted only from cooling the electrons already present within the rbw and those being swept - up by it .",
    "the observed flux suffers a precipitous decrease with further evolution that depends on the value of @xmath43 relative to the deceleration radius @xmath66 corresponding to the resulting value of @xmath1 ; if @xmath67 , the flux remains at a roughly constant level until @xmath1 resumes its decline , at @xmath68 , through accumulation of mass on the expanding rbw ; if @xmath69 , then @xmath1 will continue its decline at the much slower conventional level of afterglow theory .",
    "the detailed , long term evolution of the grb flux depends on @xmath70 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 that determine the values of @xmath71 and @xmath1 at which the rbw becomes supercritical  it is conceivable that for certain parameter combinations supercriticality can be reached at more than one radius , with the released energy being proportional to the time between the corresponding bursts see e.g. @xcite . in figure [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] we present the evolution of a rbw with @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the parameters are @xmath74 cm , @xmath75 g and total isotropic energy @xmath76 erg .",
    "figure [ fig1]a depicts the evolution of @xmath1 as a function of radius in this medium with ( thin line ) and without ( thick line ) the radiative feedback .",
    "the drop in @xmath1 corresponds to the explosive energy release in the protons and the slow down of the rbw due to the radiation drag . as deduced from this figure , @xmath77 , since for @xmath78 , @xmath79 , as expected for adiabatic propagation in a wind density profile ( thick line ) .",
    "after the decrease in @xmath1 due to the radiative feedback and after the non - adiabatic effects have died out , the evolution of @xmath1 follows a similar track of lower normalization .",
    "figure [ fig1]b shows the multiwavelength spectra at various instances as perceived by the observer .",
    "as it was shown in mk06 the spectrum consists of two components , one that is due to the primary particle emission by particles on the rbw and one due to the bulk comptonization of the upstream - reflected primary radiation by the cold pairs of the rbw .",
    "this latter component peaks early on at  1mev , but as the burst evolves moves to lower energies since both @xmath1 and @xmath80 drop outward .",
    "figure [ fig2]a shows the corresponding apparent isotropic bolometric luminosity as a function of time .",
    "this consists of the internally produced luminosity ( dashed ) and that due to bulk comptonization of the mirror - scattered radiation by the rbw ( dotted ) with the thick line representing their sum .",
    "as it can also be seen from fig [ fig1]b , most of the luminosity , is by far contained in the bulk - comptonized component ( at @xmath81 mev ) and exhibits the steepest decrease due to the decrease in @xmath1 and the arrest of additional pair injection from the protons . at longer time scales ,",
    "the only injection available is that of the ambient electrons and the emission exhibits the @xmath82 behavior of  standard \" afterglows .    finally fig .",
    "[ fig2]b depicts the luminosity at various energy bands as a function of time  here we make no distinction between the direct and the bulk comptonized component , but instead we exhibit their sum . as a rule",
    "higher frequencies dominate more at the early stages of the burst but drop faster due to a combination of faster cooling and the decrease in @xmath1 .",
    "this is consistent with observations : the bat flux ( that receives its major contribution from the bulk comptonized component ) decreases much faster than the flux in the other bands and its level defines , in effect , the prompt grb phase ( see also next section ) .",
    "we have presented above a first attempt at an integrated version of the spm , complete with the coupled rbw dynamics , radiation production and accumulation of hot protons on the rbw from the swept - up matter .",
    "the latter process is fundamental as the increase of the hot proton column to supercritical values is necessary for the explosive energy release seen in grb .",
    "another important feature is the coupling of the radiation to the dynamics of the rbw , the cause of the abrupt decrease in @xmath1 seen in fig .",
    "because this can reduce @xmath1 below the spm kinematic threshold , it can severely reduce the observed flux , especially its bulk - comptonized spectral component that peaks at @xmath83 mev and constitutes the main grb channel .",
    "the existence of the kinematic threshold value for @xmath1 and its intimate association to the radiation emission near @xmath84 mev , the defining grb property ) , affords for the spm an operational definition of the grb prompt phase , a feature unique amongst grb models : as such , _ the prompt grb phase is the stage in its evolution during which the kinematic threshold condition of eq .",
    "( [ thres1 ] ) is fulfilled _",
    ", accompanied by severe reduction in the grb flux following this stage , as observed .",
    "the time evolution of the flux in fig . [ fig2 ] bears great resemblance to that of many _ swift - xrt _ grb , that exibit a very steep declining profile followed by a less steep or flat section in their light curves @xcite , related , as discussed above , to the relation between @xmath51 and @xmath66 .",
    "we believe that the straightforward way that the spm addresses these vexing for the standard model questions attests to its relevance to the grb underlying physics and phenomenology . it should be noted at this point that the efficiency of conversion of kinetic energy to radiation depends on the value of the ambient density @xmath85 .",
    "this dependence comes through the dynamic threshold of the spm , as @xmath85 determines also the value of the upstream albedo ( i.e. of the  mirror \" , whose assumption is now obviated ) , to which the dynamic threshold is proportional .",
    "we plan to explore the effects of this parameter on the grb properties in a future publication .",
    "the duration of the burst shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is of order of a few seconds . as such it would be classified as a short burst , despite the fact that the rbw is assumed to propagate in a medium with properties akin to the wind of a wr star .",
    "we therefore have presented an explicit model that produces a short burst from an object of a young stellar population .",
    "while it was originally proposed and supported by the earlier observations that short bursts are associated with old stellar populations ( implying neutron star collisions as their source of energy ) , it was shown @xcite that @xmath86 of them are in fact associated with stellar populations similar to those of the long grbs .",
    "the outlook from this first time - dependent treatment of the spm replete with the csm distribution and radiation emission and feedback is that this model can potentially produce a great variety of grb light curves ( in agreement with grb phenomenology ) which it can relate to _ global _ parameters of the system .",
    "we plan to explore thoroughly these parameters in future publications ."
