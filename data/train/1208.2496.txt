    "the standard @xmath0cdm cosmological model has been extremely successful in explaining the observed acoustic peak in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation and the formation of large scale structures ( lss ) . despite its success",
    ", the @xmath0cdm model seems to have some tensions with observations at small scales .",
    "the measurement of the temperature anisotropy of the cmb showed less power spectrum at small scales , suggesting that the number of effective neutrino species , @xmath1 , has a bigger value than the one predicted by the standard model of particle physics , so the existence of ` dark radiation ' .",
    "another difficulty of @xmath0cdm model is faced at small scales of the structure formation .",
    "n - body simulation with cold dark matter ( cdm ) has shown a tension with observation in the nonlinear regime of structure formation , producing more substructures in milky - way galaxy size than the observed ones .    in the standard cosmological scenario ,",
    "the thermal plasma after the electron - positron annihilation contains photons and neutrinos . at this epoch",
    ", total radiation energy density can be parameterized as @xmath2\\rho_\\gamma , \\label{neff } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the photon energy density , @xmath4 after the electron - positron annihilation , and @xmath1 is the effective number of neutrinos , including the contribution from dark radiation if there exists any . in the standard model with three neutrino flavors , the residual heating of the neutrino fluid due to the electron - positron annihilation slightly increases @xmath1 , yielding @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "however , the wmap collaboration reported @xmath6 through the measurements of hubble constant and baryon acoustic oscillation  @xcite . similarly higher values of @xmath1 are observed by atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) and south pole telescope ( spt ) , reporting @xmath7",
    "@xcite and @xmath8  @xcite , respectively .",
    "it is expected that the planck satellite will be able to measure @xmath1 with better precision  @xcite , so make the situation more clear .",
    "the @xmath1 measured in the cmb , @xmath9 , can be compared with the value @xmath10 determined by the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "observations of the primordial @xmath11 abundance provides the best constraint on @xmath10 .",
    "however there is a controversy between different groups about the relic helium abundance , e.g. @xcite and @xcite , while another recent analysis by mangano and serpico  @xcite gives an upper bound @xmath12 . at any rate ,",
    "a larger value of @xmath1 can be explained by extra relativistic degree of freedom existing at the epoch prior to the recombination .",
    "many models are suggested to explain this dark radiation  @xcite , including the ones considering the decays of heavy particle as the origin of dark radiation  @xcite .    in the n - body simulation with cdm ,",
    "the structures form hierarchically , with small structures collapsing first and merging into larger and larger bodies .",
    "cdm model describes the distribution and correlation of structures very well at large scales , however there is a large discrepancy at small scales between the observed number of satellite galaxies of the milky way and the expected number  @xcite .",
    "this tension has brought many questions on the galaxy formation and evolution as well as the properties of dark matter .",
    "one possibility is to impose warm nature of dark matter ( wdm ) instead of coldness  @xcite .",
    "the free - streaming of wdm can reduce the power spectrum at small scales , which would result in smaller number of galactic subhalos  @xcite .",
    "in fact , wdm model with @xmath13 can alleviate the cdm overabundance problems in many respects .",
    "it resolves the discrepancy in the bright satellite galaxies  @xcite , solves the excess of predicted faint galaxies at low and high redshifts , as well as the excess of bright galaxies at low redshifts in the galaxy formation  @xcite .",
    "also it has better agreement in the hi velocity ( width ) function measured in the alfalfa survey  @xcite , and in the number of milky way satellites  @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we examine a scenario in which both dark radiation and wdm find a common origin in the decays of heavy particle .",
    "as we will see , supersymmetric axion model with relatively light saxion and axino masses provides a natural set up realizing such scenario .",
    "decays of massive saxion produce ( nearly ) massless axion pairs and massive axino pairs with different branching ratios .",
    "axions then contribute to the dark radiation , while axinos become warm dark matter which have large velocities to solve the small scale structure problems .",
    "let us consider a non relativistic particle @xmath14 , which decays dominantly to a pair of light particles ( @xmath15 dark radiation ) and also to a pair of massive particles of mass @xmath16 ( @xmath17 dark matter ) with small branching ratio .",
    "the energy density of nonrelativistic particles decreases as @xmath18 , while the radiation energy density behaves as @xmath19 . therefore even when the mass density of @xmath14 was initially subdominant , it can be important when @xmath14 decays .",
    "after decay , all daughter particles are relativistic , however massive ones become nonrelativistic later due to the redshift of the momentum .",
    "after @xmath14 decays , the resulting dark radiation energy density can be parameterized by the extra effective number of neutrino species @xmath20 , which is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the extra relativistic energy density called dark radiation .    here and in the followings , we use the instantaneous decay approximation , and",
    "assume that the branching ratio of the @xmath14 decay into dm pair is small enough , so the dm density at the time @xmath24 of @xmath14 decays is negligible . then the dr energy density right after @xmath24 is nearly equal to @xmath25 right before @xmath24 : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the mass and the abundance of the decaying @xmath14 .",
    "using the entropy density @xmath29 with @xmath30 for @xmath31 , one easily finds that @xmath32 at time @xmath24 is given by @xmath33 where the relation between lifetime and the temperature in the radiation - dominated epoch is given by @xmath34 with the reduced planck mass @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ dnefft ] ) can be reexpressed as @xmath37    the dm particles produced from the decay of @xmath14 are relativistic initially .",
    "however their momenta are red - shifted due to the expansion of the universe , making them non - relativistic at the epoch @xmath38 when the red - shifted momentum becomes comparable to the mass @xmath39 after this epoch , the energy density of the dm particles produced by the decays of @xmath14 decreases more slowly than the radiation energy density , and constitute the non - thermally produced dark matter mass density : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the branching fraction of @xmath42 . imposing the condition @xmath43 the mass ratio between @xmath16 and @xmath27",
    "is constrained as @xmath44 or equivalently ( using eq .",
    "( [ dneff ] ) ) @xmath45 in figure  [ fig : neff1 ] , we show the contour plot of @xmath46 ( blue sold lines ) in the plane of @xmath47 and @xmath24 which gives @xmath48 assuming that most of the dark matters are produced from the decay of @xmath14 .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     the saxion also produces axinos with decay rate @xmath49^{3/2 } , \\end{split}\\ ] ] for which the branching ratio is given by @xmath50 such non - thermally produced axinos play the role of warm dark matter and can solve the small scale structure problems as explained in the previous section .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : neff2 ] , we show the viable region in the plane of @xmath51 and @xmath52 for @xmath53 and the reheat temperature @xmath54 of the primordial inflation .",
    "the blue lines denote @xmath55 and 1.5 , while the red lines stand for @xmath56 and @xmath57 . on the dashed magenta line ,",
    "axinos produced by saxion decays constitute most of the dark matter for @xmath58 and 0.2 .",
    "therefore in the overlapped region of blue and red bands , which corresponds to @xmath59 and @xmath60 , both dark radiation and small scale structure problems can be explained with corresponding value of @xmath61 between @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively . in this region",
    "the relic density of the thermally produced axinos is less than about 10 % of dark matter ( black solid line ) , thus most of the axino dark matters are produced from saxion decays .",
    "the decay of saxions can produce electromagnetic and hadronic particles which can disrupt the light element abundances after bbn .",
    "the lifetime of saxion in the region of our interest is between @xmath64 and @xmath65 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : neff2 ] , we show the bbn and cmb bound with green lines  @xcite and the upper region is disallowed . in this region , the constraints on the hadronic and electromagnetic injections lead to @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 denote the branching ratios for the hadronic and electromagnetic injections .",
    "these constraints can be easily satisfied if the saxion mass is below the pion production threshold @xmath69 .    for the axino mass much smaller than the value of @xmath70 , the branching fraction ( [ branching_ratio ] ) might be too small to provide the correct amount of dr and wdm simultaneously , for a given @xmath61 , as presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : neff1 ] . if we take a rather large coupling , @xmath71 , the right amount for dr and wdm can be obtained for high reheating temperature @xmath72 . however , in this case , the thermal production of axino becomes much larger than the non - thermal production from saxion decays  @xcite .",
    "consequently , the mass range @xmath73 is not favored by our scenario . the cosmological and astrophysical constraints on supersymmetric axion models are also well summarized in @xcite .",
    "we then find that the saxion mass around @xmath74 with peccei - quinn scale around @xmath75 and reheating temperature @xmath76 can explain both dark radiation and small scale structure problems , while satisfying all the constraints from bbn , cold axino abundance , and gravitino problem .",
    "if the axion in our model is a qcd axion solving the strong cp problem , we need a small axion misalignment angle @xmath77 in order for the cold axion dark matter to be subdominant compared to the warm axino dark matter produced by saxion decays .",
    "we close this section with a brief discussion of susy breaking schemes which can give the saxion mass @xmath78 and the axino mass @xmath79 .",
    "we first note that in gauge mediation with a messenger scale @xmath80 , saxion and axino masses can be much lighter than the mssm soft parameters as they are further suppressed by some powers of @xmath81 .",
    "furthermore if saxion is stabilized by radiative effects , a small hierarchy between the saxion and axino masses , e.g. @xmath82 , can arise in a natural manner . on the other hand ,",
    "if there exists a susy breaking sector well sequestered from the visible sector as well as from the pq sector , the gravitino mass can be much heavier than the axino mass .",
    "these points suggest that there can be a plenty of rooms for the mediation of susy breaking yielding the desired saxion and axino masses while satisfying the known phenomenological and cosmological constraints .",
    "an explicit construction of such model is beyond the scope of this paper , and will be the subject of upcoming work  @xcite .",
    "we have examined the possibility that late decays of massive particle after bbn can provide a common origin for dark radiation around the epoch of recombination and warm dark matter with free streaming which can solve the small scale structure problems . as a specific example",
    ", we proposed a supersymmetric axion model in which dark radiation axions and warm dark matter axinos are produced by the decays of saxion , and identified a parameter space which can successfully realize the scenario while satisfying all the cosmological constraints .",
