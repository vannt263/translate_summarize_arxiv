    "a notion at the very core of graph theory , chordality is a statement about the geometry and complexity of cycles in a graph , stating in essence that a cycle is decomposable in the most economic way imaginable .",
    "the relation of graph chordality to commutative algebra in particular has motivated many to attempt a generalization of graph chordality to higher dimensions , often using a homological or combinatorial perspective ( we surveyed and summarized this perspective in @xcite ) . however , homological notions , as we shall argue here , are not adequate to capture graph chordality in simplicial complexes , especially not in relation to commutative algebra , and the apparent failure of several important results of graph chordality for homological chordality is a flaw of the approach rather than the problem .",
    "as we will see , higher chordality has a better life if we add more information , and let it live in the toric variety ( for simplicial polytopes at least ) , and is a natural symptom of the hard lefschetz theorem , reflecting geometric changes ( as measured by the size of the support ) brought about by multiplication with a lefschetz element .",
    "philosophically , we argue that to describe the geometric behavior of simplicial chain complexes , it is better if the boundary map is close to injective .",
    "toric geometry allows us to control the boundary map by removing redundant chains in its kernel by factoring out the torus action .    to understand this for general simplicial complexes , we use stress spaces @xcite , a construction going back to equilibrium problems in mechanics and elastic introduced by varignon @xcite .",
    "it turned out much later that they form a useful model for the intersection theory of a toric variety , in particular the fact that it allows us to describe the support of a chow cohomology class straightforwardly and combinatorially @xcite .",
    "the key observation inspiring us was made by kalai @xcite ( compare also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2.4.10 ) ) , using a synthetic approach to relate chordality of the graph of a simplicial polytope to minimal rigidity .",
    "this beautiful observation deserves a full understanding , especially so because it gives a useful picture of simplicial polytopes with vanishing of primitive second betti numbers ( with respect to the action of a lefschetz element in the cohomology ring of the associated toric variety ) .",
    "two natural questions that arise in this context are to    extend the observation to all primitive betti numbers and , far more challenging ,    quantify it beyond the extreme case of vanishing primitive betti numbers .",
    "the first problem has been addressed in the celebrated generalized lower bound theorem of murai and nevo @xcite , though without clarifying the beautiful relation to the geometry of homology cycles kalai exhibited .",
    "additionally , their proof relies rather heavily on earlier work of green which seems hard , if not impossible , to quantify satisfyingly due to the reliance on generic initial ideals that destroy much of the combinatorial properties of the simplicial complex .",
    "the first goal is therefore to understand , reprove and generalize kalai s theorem in a proper context .",
    "a secondary objective is to provide a direct and , most importantly , quantifiable proof of the generalized lower bound theorem of murai and nevo @xcite , thereby solving both problems at once , using the newly introduced method of toric chordality .",
    "we will also apply our technique to the balanced generalized lower bound conjecture of klee and novik @xcite .",
    "more conceptually , this investigation is in line with combinatorial - geometric approaches to intersection theory that has seen remarkable successes disconnecting it from the algebraic varieties it classically lives on ( compare @xcite ) .",
    "toric chordality is way to study models of intersection theory in a rather precise geometric way without going to the toric variety . in particular",
    ", the present research also has some application to conjectures detailing the interplay between toric algebraic geometry and approximation theory @xcite . *",
    "acknowledgements * we thank satoshi murai and eran nevo for extraordinarily useful comments and inspiring conversations concerning their work on the generalized lower bound theorem , and robert macpherson for pointing out some historical facts .",
    "we also thank the referee for a thorough read of this paper .",
    "before we turn to defining chordality within models of intersection theory , it is useful to recall the homological approach to higher chordality @xcite .",
    "while it is an immediate and naive generalization of graph chordality to higher dimensions , we will find it rather unsatisfactory .",
    "nevertheless , it is useful to keep in mind , as it does not depend on a geometric realization of the simplicial complex , and it is easily understandable in terms of simplicial homology .",
    "let @xmath0 be a simplicial complex .",
    "we will consider the * collection of @xmath1-faces * @xmath2 , and the simplicial complex of faces of dimension @xmath3 , the * @xmath1-skeleton * @xmath4 of @xmath5 .",
    "a * @xmath1-clique * is a simplicial complex of dimension @xmath1 that contains all possible faces of dimension @xmath3 on its vertex set , and we say that a simplicial complex has a * complete @xmath1-skeleton * if its @xmath1-skeleton is a @xmath1-clique . with this , one can associate to any simplicial complex its * @xmath1-clique complex * , defined as @xmath6 the * support * of a simplicial @xmath1-chain ( cf .",
    "@xcite for basics of simplicial homology ) is the simplicial complex generated by the @xmath1-faces on which the chain is non - zero .",
    "a graph @xmath7 is * chordal * if every simple cycle of length @xmath8 has a chord , i.e. , an edge connecting non - adjacent vertices of the cycle .",
    "the homological statement this translates to is explaining that a graph is chordal if and only if every cycle @xmath9 can be written as a sum of @xmath10-cycles of length @xmath11 that support no vertices that are not already vertices of @xmath9 .",
    "said in yet another way , graph chordality is equivalent to the condition that for any @xmath10-cycle @xmath9 in @xmath12 , there exists a @xmath13-chain @xmath14 in @xmath0 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "this leads us to basic notions of homological chordality . for simplicity , we restrict to homology with real coefficients here .",
    "we say that a @xmath17-chain @xmath18 is a * resolution * of a @xmath1-cycle @xmath19 if @xmath20 and @xmath15 .",
    "we say that a simplicial complex @xmath0 in which every @xmath1-cycle admits a resolution is * ( resolution ) @xmath1-chordal*.    the * @xmath1-leray property * encodes the property that a simplicial complex is @xmath21-chordal for all @xmath22 .",
    "a fundamental property of graph chordality , which goes back at least as far as to dirac , is that graph chordality implies the leray property immediately once the trivial obstruction vanishes .",
    "we call this the * propagation property * of graph chordality .",
    "recall that a * nonface * of a simplicial complex @xmath5 is , naturally , a simplex on groundset @xmath23 that is not a face of @xmath5 .",
    "a * minimal nonface * , or * missing face * , of @xmath5 is an inclusion minimal nonface of @xmath5 .",
    "equivalently , a simplex @xmath24 is a missing face of @xmath5 iff @xmath25 , but @xmath26 .    if @xmath0 is a simplicial complex such that    @xmath27 is a chordal graph .",
    "@xmath0 has no missing faces of dimension @xmath28 .",
    "then @xmath0 is @xmath10-leray .",
    "one natural test of strength for a generalization of chordality is whether it satisfies a propagation principle , and homological chordality falls short of this aspect in dimension @xmath28 .",
    "[ thm : prp_exterior ] let @xmath0 denote any ( abstract ) simplicial complex without missing faces of dimension @xmath29 .",

    "we take this as a motivation to come up with a better notion of higher chordality that can better control the geometry of cycles .",
    "there are several important models for the intersection theory of a complete toric variety @xcite , but two shall be of special importance here : the intersection ring generated by divisors and chow cohomology .",
    "their combinatorial cousins are stanley - reisner rings and minkowski weights ( or mcmullen  lee stress spaces ) , respectively . because toric chordality will be natural for geometric simplicial complexes beyond polytopes we will be working with these models rather than within toric geometry .",
