    "the discovery that the ovii , oviii x - ray and ovi uv absorption in quasar 3c351 could be readily modeled by a single a x - ray / uv absorber ( mathur 1994 ) offered new and unique way to determine the physical conditions of the absorbing material in agn .",
    "as more x - ray / uv absorbers were found it became clear that , although they span a wide range of parameter space , they are systematically : highly ionized ; with high column density ; low density ; outflowing ; and situated outside the broad emission line region . with these properties",
    "the x / uv absorbers delineate a previously unrecognized nuclear component of agns with important consequences - a wind or outflow which carries significant kinetic energy and a mass loss rate comparable to the accretion rate needed to power the agn continuum ( mathur , elvis & wilkes 1995 : mew95 ) .",
    "the x - ray / uv connection was further strengthened when crenshaw ( 1997 ) found that uv and x - ray absorption tend to occur together in seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "it is possible that a wide range of associated absorbers including broad absorption line systems , are related through a continuum of properties such as the column density , ionization parameter , and outflow velocity .",
    "first though we need to establish how common the x / uv absorbers are ; whether the x - ray absorbers are really physically related to the uv absorbers in all agn ; whether this unified picture is quite general or is merely a chance coincidence in a minority of cases . in order to answer these questions , as well as to probe the nuclear material in more objects , we initiated a hst program to search quasars known to have x - ray ionized ( `` warm '' ) absorbers for the uv absorbers predicted by the unified x - ray / uv absorber model .",
    "though common in seyfert galaxies and radio - loud quasars , uv absorption is rare in radio - quiet quasars ( @xmath2 ) ; hence these observations give a statistically strong test .    here",
    "we present a positive detection for the first object observed : pg1114 + 445 .",
    "this is a radio - quiet quasar at z=0.144 and was the only one of a well defined sub - sample of 23 pg quasars to show an ionized absorber signature in its rosat spectrum ( laor  1994 ) .",
    "on 23 november 1996 we observed  with the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) on board the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , using a 1@xmath3 aperture .",
    "the source acquisition was done in a four step sequence to ensure pointing accuracy of 0.12@xmath3 .",
    "grating g130h was used on the blue side of the detector and g190h and g270h on the red side .",
    "the total exposure was 12,820 seconds on g130 , 4,360 seconds on g190 and 180 seconds on g270h .",
    "we will focus only on the properties of the absorption lines in this paper .",
    "the analysis and discussion of the emission line properties is deferred to another paper ( wills  1998 ) .",
    "the data were reduced with iraf using the standard procedure described in the hst data handbook .",
    "the data accumulated with different exposures were combined and wavelength calibrated .",
    "the final spectra are shown in figure  1 .",
    "strong absorption lines are clearly observed superimposed on the emission lines of , nv , and civ , as expected from the x / uv models .",
    "the absorption lines are much deeper than the continuum level implying that the broad emission line region ( belr ) is partially covered by the absorbing material .",
    "the models also predict ovi absorption lines . the g130 spectrum around ovi (",
    "observed @xmath4   ) has very low signal - to - noise , but does show a marginally detected ovi absorption line .",
    "absorption in the low ionization line of mgii is not detected , again as expected given the high ionization of the x - ray absorber .",
    "the measurement of absorption lines situated within a broad emission line profile is inherently uncertain since the real shape of the emission line is unknown .",
    "we use two separate methods to measure the line equivalent widths ( ew ) .",
    "the initial analysis of the absorption lines used the iraf task * splot * and the results are given in table 1 .",
    "we estimate the * splot * errors on the ew of the  and civ lines to be @xmath040% .",
    "the errors on the nv doublet are smaller , @xmath010% , because the nv emission line is very weak and so the continuum for the absorption lines is much better defined .",
    "the civ absorption doublet is highly blended for two reasons : ( 1 ) the resolution of g190h is not as high ( 1.47   per diode compared to 1   per diode of g130h ) ; ( 2 ) the separation between the components of the civ doublet is smaller ( 2.57   compared to 4   for nv ) . as a result it is difficult to measure the ews of the individual components and table 1 lists the total ew of the civ absorption doublet .",
    "the nv doublet components have about the same ew , with a doublet ratio of about 1 indicating that the lines are saturated .",
    "the troughs do not reach zero intensity ; higher resolution observations would be required to detect the dark cores of the lines .",
    "it is also possible that the line cores do not reach zero intensity as a result of scattering and/or partial covering ( korista  1992 , barlow  1997 ) .",
    "the present observations , however , do not have high enough resolution to detect such effects .",
    "the ovi absorption line is only marginally detected , so we have estimated only a rough lower limit on the ew .",
    "fitting the emission and absorption lines together , in some cases allows better estimates of the ews of the lines .",
    "accordingly the * stsdas * task * specfit * ( contributed by g. kriss ) was also used to determine line parameters , subject to some assumptions on the shape of the emission line profile .",
    "we characterized the continuum with a simple power - law , the emission lines with multiple gaussians , and each absorption line with a single gaussian .",
    "we first fitted the continuum in a featureless part of the spectrum .",
    "the parameters of the power - law continuum , the slope and normalization , were then fixed in subsequent fits .",
    "the parameters of the emission lines ( flux , centroid , fwhm and skew ) and absorption lines ( ew , centroid and fwhm ) were allowed to be free .",
    "the fits to the , nv and civ profiles are shown in figure 2 and the corresponding ew and fwhm of the absorption lines are given in table 1 .",
    "the two methods , * splot * and * specfit * give consistent results , although the * specfit * results are systematically higher .",
    "these uncertainties do not dominate the current discussion .",
    "the fwhm of the lines is @xmath5 km s@xmath1 , well resolved given the nominal spectral resolution of 11.5   ( @xmath6 km s@xmath1 ) ( the fwhm of the milky way interstellar mgii lines is 22.2  , consistent with the nominal resolution of 2.09   in g270h ) .",
    "this would imply that the absorber is dispersed in velocity space .",
    "the redshift of the absorption lines is 0.142 ( table 1 ) , blueshifted by 600  km  s@xmath1 compared to the quasar redshift of 0.144 .",
    "the redshift of ovi line could not be measured accurately due to its very low s / n , but may be slightly offset to the blue .",
    "all the parameters of ovi given in table 1 are highly uncertain .",
    "the hst spectrum of  shows the associated high ionization , nv , civ ( and possibly ovi ) absorption lines predicted from the x / uv models . is this just a chance coincidence ?    about 10% of seyfert galaxies observed with iue have associated absorption lines in their uv spectra ( ulrich , 1988 ) , so there is a 10% chance of finding them in any randomly selected seyfert galaxy . in the hst sample of seyfert galaxies",
    "crenshaw ( 1997 ) finds the fraction of @xmath0 50% .",
    "however , for higher luminosity quasars , strong narrow associated absorption appears to arise predominantly in steep spectrum , radio - loud objects ( foltz  1988 ) rather than in radio - quiet quasars such as .",
    "in fact , there has been some evidence of a dichotomy between the occurrence of narrow associated absorption in radio - loud quasars , and broad associated absorption in radio - quiet quasars ( i.e. in balqsos , foltz _ et al . _",
    "only 1 of 29 radio - quiet quasars showed associated absorption in the sample studied by foltz similarly , in x - rays , warm absorbers are observed in about half of the seyfert 1 galaxies ( reynolds , 1997 ) .",
    "but absorption in radio - quiet quasars is not as frequent . in the complete sample of 20 radio - quiet pg quasars observed by laor ( 1994 ) ,   was the only object with evidence for absorption by ionized matter .    the probability for  to have associated uv absorption _ and _",
    "x - ray ionized absorption by chance is then @xmath01.7@xmath7 .",
    "the two absorption systems must be physically related .      a detailed comparison of the uv and x - ray absorbers is required to see if they originate in the same physical component of the nuclear material of the agn .",
    "the x - ray properties of the ionized absorber in , based on asca observations , are given in george  ( 1997 ) .",
    "the absorber showed an oxygen edge with optical depth of about 3.1 at 0.76 kev , reminiscent of the oxygen edges seen in the rosat spectra of 3c351 ( fiore 1993 ) and ngc3783 ( turner 1993 ) .",
    "the total equivalent hydrogen column density of the absorber is @xmath8 @xmath9 and the x - ray ionization parameter @xmath10 ( corresponding to a traditional ionization parameter u=16.67 )",
    ". only x - ray photons between 0.1 kev and 10 kev are integrated ( netzer 1996 ) ] using the best fit warm absorber model , george   predicted the column densities of the relevant ions using the photoionization code ion ( table  1 ) .",
    "the shape of the input continuum used in the ion code is defined in netzer ( 1996 ) .",
    "the shape of the input continuum can affect the ionization state of the gas considerably ( mew95 ) .",
    "so we also used two other ionizing continua as input to the photoionization code cloudy ( ferland 1996 ) to derive the column densities of the uv - observed ions .",
    "if we use the standard agn continuum given in cloudy ( corresponding to u=5.37 ) , the derived column densities are 2 - 5 times larger ( table  1 ) .",
    "the observed continuum of   itself is somewhat different again . in the cloudy agn continuum",
    "the x - ray power - law of slope ( @xmath11 ) @xmath120.7 extends down to 0.3 kev , while below 0.3 kev there is a steep upturn into the euv region .",
    "the observed x - ray power - law index in   is 0.8 all the way down to 0.11 kev .",
    "the observed continuum ( corresponding to u=6.46 ) gives larger uv line column densities ( table 1 ) by a factor of 3 - 9 compared to the cloudy agn continuum .",
    "clearly , the ionic column densities are sensitive to the shape of the ionizing continuum .",
    "since the important euv range is unobservable , we can not derive the column densities accurately .    to compare the uv and x - ray absorbers we now have to convert the ews of the absorption lines in the hst spectra to the column densities of the ions .",
    "however , as discussed in @xmath13 , the lines are saturated and so column densities can not be measured directly without knowing the velocity dispersion parameter ( parameter ) of the lines",
    ". the parameter must be less than the fwhm of the lines ( table 1 ) , so b@xmath14 km s@xmath1 .",
    "we obtain lower limits to the column densities assuming them to be on the linear portion of the curve - of - growth using both * splot * and * specfit * values ( table  1 ) .",
    "we find these column density limits to be consistent with those predicted from the x - ray data ( table  1 ) .",
    "for the uv and x - ray values to match we further require @xmath15 km s@xmath1 ( see mew95 for the details of the method ) .",
    "this constrains to 300 500 km s@xmath1 .",
    "higher resolution observations can test this directly .",
    "moreover , given this allowed range the uv absorption lines can not split into more than 23 components if all correspond to the x - ray absorber .",
    "the ready quantitative agreement of the uv and x - ray derived ion column densities argues that the uv and x - ray absorption is highly likely to originate in the same material . at a minimum",
    ", the x - ray absorber makes a large contribution to the absorption seen in the uv",
    ".    from the blueshifts of the absorption lines the outflow velocity of the x / uv absorber is about 600  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "outflows are normal in associated absorption systems and can be used to derive some interesting numbers ( mew95 ) assuming the uv and x - ray absorbers are the same .",
    "we know that the absorber has column density of n@xmath16 atoms @xmath9 and ionization parameter u=5.37 ( for the cloudy agn continuum ) . from photoionization",
    "modeling the distance of the absorber from the nucleus is r=2.4@xmath17  cm ( where n@xmath18 is density in the units of 10@xmath19 @xmath20 ) . the depth of the absorption lines is clearly larger than the continuum level ( figure 1 ) , so the absorber must be situated outside the broad emission line region ( belr ) , similar to other x / uv absorbers ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "scaling from the belr size from the reverberation mapping of ngc5548 ( clavel  1991 ) for   luminosity ( l@xmath22 erg s@xmath1 ) yields a distance of the belr from the central continuum of @xmath23 pc . so the distance of the absorber r@xmath24  cm",
    "this puts an upper limit on the density , n@xmath25 @xmath20 .",
    "the mass of the absorber is then @xmath26  m@xmath27 for a covering factor of f=10%",
    ". the line of sight mass outflow rate would be m@xmath28=1.1@xmath29 m@xmath27 yr@xmath1 comparable to the accretion rate of 0.9 m@xmath27 yr@xmath1 needed to power   at 10% efficiency .",
    "the line of sight kinetic energy carried out in the flow is not as large , however , @xmath30 erg s@xmath1 ( c.f m@xmath28=10@xmath29 m@xmath27 yr@xmath1 in ngc5548 and kinetic energy of @xmath31 erg  s@xmath1 , l@xmath32 erg s@xmath1 ) .",
    "the hst fos uv spectrum of   contains associated high ionization , uv absorption lines , as predicted from models of the x - ray ionized absorber .",
    "we find that the absorber is situated outside the belr and outflowing with a line of sight velocity of @xmath33 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the mass outflow rate of 1.1 m@xmath27  yr@xmath1 for a 10% covering factor , is comparable to the accretion rate onto the nuclear black - hole .",
    "the rarity of both uv and x - ray absorbers individually in radio - quiet quasars virtually requires that the x - ray and uv absorbers are closely physically related .",
    "the close similarity of the column densities obtained from both uv and x - ray data strongly suggests that they are identical .",
    "thus the absorber in  satisfies both statistical as well as physical tests of our x / uv absorber model .",
