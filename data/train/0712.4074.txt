    "the dynamical patterns generated by the conductance - based models typically depend sensitively on parameters .",

    "in contrast , the bursting dynamics in type ii scenario are driven by the random motion along the slow manifold .",

    "above , irregular spiking ( fig . [ f.-1]a ) or bursting patterns ( fig .",

    "the statistics of the first exit times can then be related to the properties of the emergent firing patterns such as the frequency of spiking or the distribution of the number of spikes within one burst .",
    "compared to the analysis of the irregular spiking in the randomly perturbed fitzhugh - nagumo model ( fig .",

    "we study the vector fields arising in the context of bursting .",
    "the specialized structure of this class of problems allows us to keep the analysis of the present paper self - contained and avoid using more technical methods , which are necessary for analyzing more general situations .",
    "our analytical approach is based on the reduction of a randomly perturbed differential equation model to the poincare map and studying the exit problems for the trajectories of the discrete system .",
    "using maps is quite natural in the context of bursting due to the intrinsic discreteness of bursting patterns imposed by the presence of spikes .",
    "reductions to maps have been very useful for analyzing bursting dynamics in a variety of deterministic models @xcite . as follows from the results of the present paper ,",
    "the first return maps also provide a very convenient and visual representation for the mechanism underlying noise - induced bursting .",
    "in particular , we show that the distributions of spikes in one burst in many cases are effectively determined by @xmath10 linear randomly perturbed maps .",
    "we develop a set of probabilistic techniques for analyzing the dynamics of randomly perturbed @xmath10 and @xmath1 linear maps such as those arising in the analysis of bursting .",

    "we first analyze a simple linear map with an attracting slope and small additive gaussian perturbations in section 3.2 . due to the simple structure of the map",
    ", we obtain very explicit characterization of the first exit times for this problem .",
    "the analysis of this first relatively simple example provides the guidelines for the more complex cases dealt in sections 3.3 - 3.5 .",

    "the latter are interpreted as the distributions of the number of spikes in one burst . in sections 4.5 ,",
    "we outline the modifications necessary to cover type ii models .",

    "at the end of this section , we propose two randomly perturbed models .",
    "suppose the trajectories of ( [ 1.1 ] ) and ( [ 1.2 ] ) experience weak stochastic forcing , such that the perturbed trajectories represent well - defined stochastic processes and are close to the trajectories of ( [ 1.1 ] ) and ( [ 1.2 ] ) on finite intervals of time .",
    "since the trajectories of the unperturbed system remain in a small neighborhood of @xmath41 ( possibly after short transients ) , we expect that in the presence of noise the trajectories will occasionally leave the ba of @xmath41 and after making a brief excursion along @xmath42 will return back to the vicinity of @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , under random perturbation the system can exhibit bursting dynamics , while the underlying deterministic system is in the spiking regime .",
    "we refer to this mode of behavior as _ noise - induced _ bursting .",
    "our goal is to describe typical statistical regimes associated with the noise - induced bursting and to relate them to the structure of ( [ 1.1 ] ) and ( [ 1.2 ] ) and to the properties of the stochastic forcing . to illustrate the implications of the structure of the deterministic vector field for the bursting patterns that it produces under random perturbations",
    ", we refer to the following numerical examples .",
    "note that the ba of @xmath41 naturally extends along the cylinder of periodic orbits @xmath23 ( fig .",
    "[ f.1]c ) .",
    "the escape from the ba of @xmath41 can be dominated by the fluctuations along @xmath23 or by those in the transverse plane .",
    "these two possibilities are shown in fig .",
    "[ f.2 ] . the trajectory shown in fig .",
    "[ f.2]a spends most of the time near @xmath41 and leaves its ba due to the fluctuations in the fast subsystem .",
    "we refer to this scenario as _ type i _ escape .",
    "alternatively , the trajectory shown in fig .",
    "[ f.2]b travels a good deal along @xmath23 before the escape and exits from the ba near @xmath22 .",
    "this mechanism is dominated by the slow dynamics .",
    "we refer to this scenario as _ type ii _ escape",
    ". these mechanisms of escape translate into distinct features of the resultant bursting patterns .",
    "first , note that since in type i and type ii scenarios , the transition from spiking to quiescence typically takes place at @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively , by ( [ 1.2 ] ) and ( eq ) , the corresponding interburst intervals are approximately equal to @xmath45 in addition , we expect that the interspike intervals ( isis ) within one burst in type i scenario are localized about @xmath46 , since the trajectory of the randomly perturbed system in the active phase of bursting spends most of the time near @xmath41 .",
    "in type ii bursting patterns , isis are expected to have more variability , since the trajectories sample a wider range of isis during their excursions along @xmath23 .",
    "perhaps , a more pronounced distinction between these two types of bursting patterns lies in the degree of the variability of the spikes in one burst .",
    "most of the spikes forming a burst in type i pattern are generated by ( [ 1.3 ] ) with @xmath43 and , therefore , are similar in shape ( fig .",
    "[ f.2]c ) .",
    "in contrast , spikes in type ii scenario are subject to more variability and the bursting patterns typically have ragged shape ( fig . [ f.2]d ) .    to study type i and type ii noise - induced bursting patterns it is convenient to consider two types of models .",

    "in this section , we develop probabilistic tools needed for the analysis of randomly perturbed systems ( [ 0.1])-([0.2a ] ) .",
    "the number of spikes in one burst is a natural random variable associated with the noise - induced bursting .",

    ", we will show that the number of spikes in one burst is represented by a stopping time ( more precisely , the level exceedance time ) of a discrete random process , the poincare map of the randomly perturbed system ( [ 0.1])-([0.2a ] ) . in preparation for the analysis of the linearized poincare map in section 4 , in the present section we study certain stochastic linear difference equations .",
    "the equations of this form equations have been considered in the literature before .",

    "there is also a review paper @xcite , unfortunately not easily accessible .",
    "the convergence properties of the solutions that we will need could be deduced from a general theory of stochastic difference equations .",
    "however , the results in the literature are often stated in the most general form and some of the proofs are rather involved .",
    "we will be dealing with special cases that are much easier to justify .",
    "for this reason , and also to keep the paper self - contained we will include the proofs of the needed results .",

    "next , we approximate the poincare map and the ba of the limit cycle @xmath41 and characterize the distribution of the exit times for the approximate problem . this distribution",
    "is then related to the distribution of the number of spikes within bursting episodes . to approximate the poincare map we linearize it around the stable fixed point of the deterministic map corresponding to the limit cycle @xmath41 . aside from the systematic derivation of the poincare map in the previous subsections , we offer no rigorous justification for substituting the nonlinear poincare map with its linear part in the analysis of the exit problem .",
    "while in general , such approximation may not be accurate , we believe that for the present problem , the analysis of the linearized system captures the statistics of the first exit times well for the following reason . in models of square wave bursting the limit cycle generating spiking is often located close to the boundary of its ba ( see fig .",
    "[ f.4]b for a representative example ) .",
    "therefore , before the trajectories leave the ba , they remain in a small neighborhood of the limit cycle , where the linear part of the vector field governs the dynamics . after these preliminary remarks ,",
    "we turn to the derivation of the approximate problem and its analysis .    lemmas [ fast - map ] and [ slow ] yield the asymptotic formulae for the first return map of the randomly perturbed system ( [ 0.1 ] ) and ( [ 0.2 ] ) in the normal coordinates ( [ 2.4 ] ) : @xmath364 where @xmath365 are given in ( [ 6.1 ] ) and the expressions for @xmath356 and @xmath366 are are given in ( [ 9.23]),([6.8 ] ) , and ( [ 6.9 ] ) . recall that by ( ss ) ( see section 2 ) , @xmath37 has a simple zero at @xmath367 and @xmath368 .",
    "thus , @xmath369 is an attracting fixed point of the unperturbed map ( [ 6.01 ] ) and ( [ 6.02 ] ) with @xmath322 . the linearization of ( [ 6.01 ] ) and ( [ 6.02 ] ) about @xmath369 yields @xmath370 where @xmath371 , @xmath372 , and @xmath221 .",
    "the distributions of the rvs @xmath366 depend on @xmath373 , as both the upper bound of integration @xmath319 and the integrands in ( [ 9.23 ] ) and ( [ 6.9 ] ) are smooth functions of @xmath6 .",
    "the stochastic terms @xmath374 in the linearized system are obtained by evaluating the expressions for @xmath374 in ( [ 9.23 ] ) and ( [ 6.9 ] ) at @xmath367 .",
    "thus , @xmath375 are iid copies of a @xmath376 , where the entries of @xmath181 are @xmath325 in a sense that they do not depend on any other parameters .",
    "further , we approximate the ba of @xmath41 by a cylindrical shell , so that in @xmath377 coordinate plane , it projects to @xmath378\\times \\left[-\\tilde h_\\eta , h_\\eta\\right]$ ] for some @xmath379 independent of @xmath380 .",
    "each iteration of the poincare map corresponds to a spike within a burst .",
    "the burst terminates when the trajectory leaves the ba of @xmath41 . assuming that the linearization ( [ 6.11a ] ) and ( [ 6.12a ] ) and @xmath381 provide suitable approximations for the poincare map and the ba of @xmath41 respectively , the distribution of the number of spikes in one burst can be approximated by the distribution of the first exit times for the trajectories of ( [ 6.11a ] ) and ( [ 6.12a ] ) from @xmath381 : = \\ { _ , _ } , where @xmath382 we are now in a position to apply the the results of section 3 to describe the distribution of ( [ 6.13 ] ) . by theorem [ thm:2d - geom ] ,",
    "the distribution of @xmath70 is asymptotically geometric with parameter p e^- for some @xmath383 independent of @xmath34 and @xmath121 . in the proof of theorem  [ thm:2d - geom ] , we studied a class of @xmath1 randomly perturbed maps that includes ( [ 6.11a ] ) and ( [ 6.12a ] ) .",
    "however , the distribution of @xmath70 is effectively determined by the first equation ( [ 6.11a ] ) , i.e. by the @xmath10 first return map of the fast subsystem .",
    "this can be seen by observing that according to the approximations given at the end of proof of theorem  [ thm:2d - geom ] ( see the arguments following ( [ 2nd ] ) ) if @xmath9 is sufficiently small then @xmath384 and @xmath385 .",
    "thus , in type i models the distribution of spikes in one burst is effectively determined by the @xmath10 first return map for the fast subsystem ( [ 6.11a ] ) . in particular , the statistics of the number of spikes in one burst does not depend on the relaxation parameter @xmath9 , provided the latter is sufficiently small .",
    "the derivation of the poincare map for the type ii models differs from the analysis in sections 4.1 - 4.4 for type i models only in some minor details . in this subsection",
    ", we comment on the necessary modifications and state the final result .",
    "recall that in contrast to type i models , in ( [ 0.1a ] ) and ( [ 0.2a ] ) , stochastic forcing enters the slow equation .",
    "as before , the initial condition is given by ( [ 6.1 ] ) .",
    "on finite time intervals , solutions of the ivp for ( [ 0.1a ] ) and ( [ 0.2a ] ) admit the following asymptotic expansions @xmath386 where the first order corrections @xmath387 and @xmath388 are gaussian processes ( cf .",
    "theorem 2.2 @xcite ) . using ( [ 6.23 ] ) and ( [ 6.24 ] ) , we obtain the leading order approximation of the fast subsystem : x_t = f(x_t , y_0)+ y_t^(1 ) + o ( ) . from this point",
    ", the derivation of the poincare map follows the same lines as we described in detail for type i models in sections 4.1 - 4.4 .",
    "we omit any further details and state the final result , the linear approximation of the poincare map for the present case : @xmath389 as in the previous case , we are interested in the distribution of the first exit time @xmath70 ( see ( [ 6.13 ] ) ) .",
    "to estimate the latter , we use the same argument as in the previous subsection .",
    "this time the system is described by _",
    "n+1=a_n+1_n+g_n+1,n1 , where @xmath183 is as before and @xmath390 $ ] .",
    "the presence of the factor @xmath217 in both components of @xmath186 leads to the following expression for the numerator of @xmath54 ( see ( [ limit ] ) ) : @xmath391 this expression decays very fast as a function of @xmath392 and since @xmath211 has heavy tails it is approximated ( up to inessential polynomial factors ) by @xmath393 we are now in the analogous situation to that encountered in ( [ 3rd ] ) , except that the small parameter @xmath31 appears in the denominator of the other variable . as a consequence , this time we obtain that @xmath384 for small @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , in contrast to type i models , the escape of a trajectory of ( [ 0.1a ] ) and ( [ 0.2a ] ) from @xmath394 is dominated by the slow subsystem , i.e. , @xmath395 .",
    "in the present section , we illustrate the statistical regimes identified in this study with numerical simulations of a conductance based model of a neuron in the presence of noise . to this end",
    ", we use a three variable model of a bursting neuron introduced by izhikevich @xcite .",
    "the model dynamics is driven by the interplay of the three ionic currents : persistent sodium , @xmath396 , the delayed rectifier , @xmath397 , a slow potassium @xmath398-current , @xmath399 , and a passive leak current @xmath400 .",
    "the following system of three differential equations describes the dynamics of the membrane potential , @xmath300 , and two gating variables @xmath135 and @xmath6 : @xmath401 where @xmath402 ; @xmath403 and @xmath404 , are the maximal conductance and the reversal potential of @xmath405 , @xmath406 , respectively ; and @xmath407 is the applied current . the time constants @xmath408 and @xmath409 determine the rates of activation in the populations of @xmath410 and @xmath411 channels .",
    "the steady - state functions are defined by @xmath412 the parameter values are given in the caption to fig .",
    "this completes the description of the deterministic model .",
    "the random perturbation is used in the form of white noise , @xmath413 and is added to the first equation ( [ 10.1 ] ) for type i model or to the third one ( [ 10.3 ] ) for type ii model . after suitable rescaling",
    ", these models can be put in the nondimensional form ( [ 0.1 ] ) , ( [ 0.2 ] ) or ( [ 0.1a ] ) , ( [ 0.2a ] ) .",
    "the separation of the timescales in the nondimesional models ( i.e. small @xmath414 ) is the result of the presence of the disparate time constants @xmath415 in the original model ( see caption to fig .",

    "are chosen so that it has a limit cycle located as shown in fig .",
    "[ f.1]c . in the presence of small noise the system generates bursting . in each numerical experiment , we integrated the randomly perturbed system using the euler - maruyama method @xcite until it generated @xmath416 bursts .",
    "we used these data to estimate the probability density for the number of spikes within one burst . in fig .",
    "[ f.11 ] , we plot the histograms for the number of spikes in one burst for type i and type ii models .",
    "the histograms in fig .",
    "[ f.11 ] are scaled to approximate the probability density function ( pdf ) for the number of spikes in one burst .",
    "both pdfs shown fig .",
    "[ f.11]a , b have distinct exponential tails as expected for the asymptotically geometric rvs .",
    "note that the distribution in fig .",
    "[ f.11]a fits well with the geometric distribution for @xmath417 , while in fig .",
    "[ f.11]b the geometric distribution fits the data almost on the entire domain @xmath418 .",
    "in addition , the peak in the histogram in fig .",
    "[ f.11]a is reminiscent of the pdf characteristic for the diffusive escape ( see fig .",
    "[ f.3 ] ) . for comparison",
    ", we plotted a slightly shifted diffusive pdf , @xmath419 in fig .",
    "[ f.11]a . matching the data and",
    "@xmath420 is a delicate matter , because it is not clear how wide is the range of @xmath135 , to which the estimates of theorem  [ eps=0 ] apply .",
    "nonetheless , the qualitative similarity of the peak in the histogram in the range @xmath421 and the diffusive pdf is apparent .",
    "we repeated these numerical experiments for a few other sets of parameters and found qualitatively similar results .    collecting the statistical data shown in fig .",
    "[ f.11 ] requires integrating the system over very long intervals of time , for which it would be hard to justify the accuracy of the euler - maruyama method .",
    "however , capturing the statistical features of the dynamical patterns does not require having an accurate solution on the entire interval of time , because they are determined by the discrete dynamics of the first return map .",
    "the iterations of the latter are expected to be insensitive to the numerical noise as suggested by the analysis of the randomly perturbed maps in section 3 .",
    "therefore , we only need to have accurate numerical solutions on the time intervals comparable with the typical periods of the fast oscillations .",
    "this is easy to achieve with the euler - maruyama method .",
    "we repeated these numerical experiments using the second order runge - kutta method and obtained very similar results .",
