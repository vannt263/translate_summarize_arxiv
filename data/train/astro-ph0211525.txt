    "understanding the chemistry of protostellar environments is of great importance for addressing topics of star formation .",
    "it is directly related to processes regulating star formation , for example through the ionisation and the chemistry also potentially serves as an evolutionary clock against which physical models , e.g. for the protostellar collapse , can be compared ( see e.g. @xcite for an overview ) .",
    "recent evidence suggests that many of the traditional molecular tracers of density and temperature may be subject to significant gradients in abundances .",
    "examples are the freeze - out of molecules like co onto dust grains both in pre - stellar cores ( @xcite , @xcite ) and in the cold and dense parts of low - mass protostellar envelopes ( @xcite ) and enhancement of molecules due to liberation of ice mantles in regions of higher temperatures similar to `` hot cores '' or in regions subject to shocks driven by protostellar outflows ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    in this paper a preliminary overview of the results from a large survey of the chemical properties of a sample of low - mass protostars is presented . for further details",
    "see @xcite and jrgensen et al .",
    "( 2003 ; in prep . ) .",
    "the sample of objects in this study comprises 18 pre- and protostellar objects , including 11 class 0 objects , 5 class i objects and 2 pre - stellar cores ; the full sample is presented in @xcite .",
    "these objects have been observed in a range of molecular transitions using the 15  m james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) , 20  m telescope at onsala space observatory and the iram pico valeta 30  m telescope between 2000 and 2002 .    the physical structure of each envelope",
    "is derived using 1d radiative transfer calculations .",
    "power - law density profiles are assumed for a range of envelope parameters ( e.g. density slope and optical thickness ) and the corresponding temperature profiles calculated using the radiative transfer code , dusty ( @xcite ) for a given central source of heating . for each model ,",
    "images are constructed and compared to the observed scuba images ( 450 and 850  @xmath1 m ) and seds over the range from 60  @xmath1 m to 1.3  mm .",
    "it is found that each protostellar envelope can successfully be modeled under these assumptions , whereas the pre - stellar cores can not , which is not unexpected since these sources per definition are characterized as not having central sources of heating .    the derived physical models are subsequently used as basis for calculating the molecular excitation and radiative transfer for the molecular lines using the monte carlo code of @xcite .",
    "the fractional abundances ( assumed to be constant ) are constrained through comparisons with the integrated line intensities and it is found that the majority of the lines can successfully be accounted for with the presented models and assumptions . in fig .",
    "[ abundhist ] , an overview of the average abundances for the class 0 and i objects are compared to the molecular cloud l134n ( @xcite ) and the abundances in the steady state or pre - collapse phase of the models of @xcite .",
    "the abundances are , where possible , derived from the minor isotopic lines .",
    "the main isotopic lines of e.g. cs and hco@xmath0 are more sensitive to departures from spherical symmetry or the interaction of molecular outflows with the envelope material .",
    "as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ abundhist ] and [ co ] significant differences exist between the various molecules relative to the two comparison sets of abundances and also between the samples of class 0 and i objects for some molecules  in particular co and hco@xmath0 .",
    "co is thought to be frozen out onto dust grains at low temperatures ( @xmath2  k ; @xcite ) and co is indeed most depleted for the sources with the most massive envelopes ( fig .",
    "[ co ] ) , i.e. , the envelopes with a region in which the temperatures are low enough and densities high enough that the depletion can be effective . the primary formation route of hco@xmath0 is connected to the presence of co through the reaction @xmath3 , as is indeed illustrated by the data in fig .",
    "[ hcop ] .",
    "other molecules like cs and hcn do not show a similar trend with mass , which at first may seem unexpected ( lower panel of fig .",
    "[ co ] ) : cs depletion is expected to occur at even lower densities than for co and cs should stay bound to the dust grains to even higher temperatures than co due to its larger binding energy to the dust grains .",
    "comparison to the models of @xcite shows that the cs abundances observed in the protostellar environments are indeed lower by more than an order of magnitude , which could indicate that the observed lines only probe the region where cs is depleted .",
    "a detailed comparison with other sulfur - bearing species like so will be needed to fully address this , and similarly for the nitrogen - bearing species that also show interesting features  in particular the strikingly low hnc abundances for the protostars compared to other star - forming environments .",
    "another interesting aspect of the chemistry in the envelopes around protostars is the degree of deuterium fractionation .",
    "gas - phase deuterium fractionation of molecules like hco@xmath0 is expected to be particularly efficient at low temperatures ( e.g. @xcite ) due to small zero - point energy differences of reactions like @xmath4 . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ dcop ] , the highest degree of deuterium fractionation is seen to occur in the pre - stellar cores and class 0 objects with low temperatures ( @xmath5  k ) and high densities .",
    "interestingly , the hcn deuterium fractionation seems to be anti - correlated with that of hco@xmath0 as shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ dcop ] : for hcn deuterium fractionation through other species like @xmath6 ( i.e. forming @xmath7 ) could become increasingly important in producing dcn at temperatures @xmath8  k ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "such a scenario could explain the observed anti - correlation between the deuteration of hco@xmath0 and hcn ."
