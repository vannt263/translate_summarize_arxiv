    "we consider the ferromagnetic @xmath1-state potts model @xcite on a square lattice , limiting ourselves to the isotropic , nearest - neighbour ( n.n . ) case , with no external field .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 denotes the lattice sites , @xmath5 is the kronecker symbol and @xmath6 , with @xmath7 .",
    "we suppose that the lattice is made of @xmath8 rows and @xmath9 columns , and that free boundary conditions are applied .",
    "our interest will be in the limits @xmath10 .",
    "for @xmath11 the model has a temperature driven first - order phase transition at @xmath12 . at @xmath13",
    "the free energy @xmath14 , the internal energies @xmath15 and @xmath16 of the ordered and disordered phase , and the latent heat are known exactly @xcite .",
    "still at @xmath13 , more recently an analytic formula for the correlation length has been also derived @xcite .    due to these exact results",
    ", the @xmath17 potts model has an important role in the study of the first order phase transitions @xcite . as a matter of fact its properties",
    "have been studied through several methods , such as analysis of high or low - temperature series - expansions @xcite , resummation of large @xmath1 expansions @xcite , monte carlo simulations @xcite . as a rule",
    ", the discontinuous character of the first order phase transitions makes the numerical calculations in these cases more uncertain , with respect to analogous calculations in the case of second order phase transitions .",
    "moreover we have that some aspects of the discontinuous transitions are not completely understood from a general , theoretical point of view .",
    "on the other hand an accurate description of the potts model transition , when the number of components @xmath1 is very large , is provided by the mean field theory @xcite .",
    "indeed , it has been proved that mean field theory is exact in the limit @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "so it suggests itself that a reliable quantitative analysis of the properties of our model , at least for @xmath0 , could be also obtained directly from a proper extension of this theory .    as a matter of fact , in this paper",
    "it is shown that considerable and systematic improvements of the mean field theory can be obtained in the framework of the transfer matrix approach , through an elaborate version of the standard variational method for hermitian operators .",
    "this method is alternative to the variational gibbs principle @xcite , which provides the analytical basis of the mean field procedure or , more generally , of the cluster variational method @xcite .",
    "the formal aspects of our approach are described in the next four sections .",
    "we will limit ourselves to @xmath0 .",
    "in the last section we present the results of some numerical calculations and we add some concluding remarks .",
    "let @xmath19 be the partition function of our model .",
    "we are interested in the free energy per site , @xmath20 , given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 now , if @xmath23 describes the spin configuration on a column , we can write @xmath24 in the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the symmetrized transfer matrix of our model .    the matrix @xmath28 is hermitian",
    ". therefore we can apply the spectral theorem and we can take into account of the extremal properties of its eigenvalues .",
    "we note also that , for our @xmath28 , the perron - frobenius ( p.f . ) theorem is valid @xcite .",
    "furthermore we have that @xmath28 is positive definite , that is , for any vector @xmath29 , we obtain @xmath30 in fact we can write @xmath31 where @xmath32 by expanding the product , we obtain a sum of @xmath33 terms , each giving a non negative contribution , due to @xmath34 .",
    "let @xmath35 be the highest eigenvalue of @xmath28 . from and",
    "it follows that @xcite : @xmath36 now , by considering the functional given by the rayleigh - ritz ( r.r . )",
    "quotient @xmath37 = { ( \\xi , l\\xi ) \\over ( \\xi,\\xi)},\\ ] ] we have @xmath38 = \\lambda_1(k;m),\\ ] ] the @xmath39 being attained for @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the eigenvector of @xmath28 corresponding to @xmath35 .",
    "so , for any vector @xmath29 , it results that @xmath42 this inequality is the starting point of the operatorial variational method in statistical mechanics @xcite . in this approach , the principal ( or ground state )",
    "eigenvector @xmath41 is usually described through an ansatz @xmath43 , containing one or several unknown parameters which do not depend on @xmath8 .",
    "then , within the formal structure of the considered ansatz , the best estimate of @xmath20 is obtained by fixing the parameters through @xmath44 as a matter of fact , this approach , which is at the origin of the concept of the transfer matrix , is not really adequate to analyse the properties of a critical point .",
    "however the situation can be different in the case of first order transitions .    in the following , fixing the attention on the 2d square potts model",
    ", we will discuss a further elaboration of the above variational method .",
    "first of all , it is useful to bear in mind the meaning and the role of @xmath41 . in our lattice made of @xmath8 rows , let us consider a strip @xmath45 of @xmath4 adjacent columns , having @xmath46 columns at its right and @xmath47 columns at its left .",
    "the reduced probability distribution ( r.p.d . )",
    "@xmath48 of a spin configuration on @xmath45 , obtained by averaging over all the configurations at the right and the left of @xmath45 , is given , in the limit @xmath49 , by @xmath50 for @xmath51 , while in the case of one column , we have the r.p.d . @xmath52 through @xmath53 so , an ansatz @xmath54 for @xmath41 has the role of a parametric description of the above averaging process leading to the r.p.d . @xmath55 .",
    "now , very reliable and simple descriptions , having however a different formal content , can be obtained by considering separately the high and low temperature regions .",
    "this fact drives us to introduce for @xmath54 two formal structures , generally different , which we call @xmath56 and @xmath57 and to consider @xmath54 as made of two _ charts _ @xmath58 , associated to the ordered and disordered phase , which should match , if possible , at the transition point @xmath13 .",
    "the choice of the appropriate _ chart _ is demanded to the variational method .",
    "this point of view is a sligth generalization of the traditional approach , where a fixed formal structure for @xmath54 is considered , and only the parameters are varied .",
    "however it leads quite naturally to variational approximations to @xmath59 , in which duality @xcite is exactly satisfied .",
    "in this section we introduce and discuss some one - parameter ansatz s of which we will make use in the variational approach based on equation .",
    "let us fix the attention first on the disordered phase . for large @xmath60 , due to the smallness of the correlation length , we expect that @xmath61 then , with regard to the disordered phase , we introduce the simplest one parameter ansatz for @xmath41 in the form @xmath62 that is , for @xmath63 belonging to the disordered region , the result of the averaging process at the left and the right of a column , is represented simply by a renormalized ferromagnetic coupling @xmath64 between n.n .",
    "spins , such that @xmath65 for small @xmath63 .",
    "this simplest ansatz can be improved in several ways .",
    "since the averaging process produces new interactions among the spins of a column , we need , in principle , other parameters related to these new couplings . for example , a first correction to @xmath66 can be considered by taking into account also second - neighbour interactions .",
    "however , it is possible to stay with a one parameter ansatz and , at the same time , to improve @xmath67 , by applying the transfer matrix @xmath68 to @xmath66 . as a matter of fact ,",
    "if @xmath68 is applied repeatedly to @xmath67 , we reach at the end the principal eigenvector . since @xmath68 is positive definite , we can consider , more generally , the action of @xmath69 .",
    "so , due to the simple structure of @xmath66 , we will fix our attention on the sequence of one - parameter ansatz s @xmath70 the reliability of one approximate description of @xmath41 can be tested by considering the next approximation in the sequence .",
    "then we are led to the r.r .",
    "quotients @xmath71 which can be also written in the form @xmath72 we note that @xmath73 is , for @xmath74 , the partition function of a potts@xmath75 model on a strip @xmath76 of @xmath8 rows and @xmath77 columns , having the same couplings as the original model , except on the first and last column , where there is the vertical n.n . coupling @xmath78 .",
    "this model provides an approximate description @xmath79 of the r.p.d . @xmath80 .",
    "we also remark that to potts@xmath75 is associated a @xmath81 transfer matrix @xmath82 , connecting two adjacent rows of @xmath76 .",
    "we will call @xmath83 the highest eigenvalue of @xmath82 .    in each r.r .",
    "quotient we can fix the parameter @xmath64 , by considering the variational estimate . we obtain then a sequence of estimates @xmath84 of @xmath59 , given by @xmath85 where the @xmath39 is taken over values of @xmath86 which give ferromagnetic couplings , that is @xmath87 for @xmath88 , @xmath89 for @xmath90 .",
    "it is useful to point out that , for @xmath91 , the p.f .",
    "theorem is valid for the _ reduced _ transfer matrices of finite order @xmath82 , so that , in this range of the parameters , the potts@xmath75 model has a unique _ ground state _ , as it happens in the thermodynamic limit for the original model , in the disordered phase .",
    "now , let us consider the ordered phase . for finite @xmath8 ,",
    "even if large , @xmath41 is a well defined , unique , vector ; furthermore @xmath92 has the same symmetries of the hamiltonian .",
    "however , in the limit @xmath93 , we have several phenomena as asymptotic degeneracy @xcite of the highest eigenvalue of @xmath68 , related to the occurrence of @xmath1 ordered phases , macroscopic instabilities with respect to boundary perturbations or the existence of _ spontaneous _ long range order .",
    "so , an ansatz @xmath57 will be appropriate if these aspects can be correctly predicted .",
    "in particular , if we introduce _ reduced _ transfer matrices of finite order , as we did in the disordered case , we have to elude the p.f . theorem .",
    "we show that the above requirements can be satisfied through an approximate description not of the result of the averaging process leading to @xmath41 , but of the process itself .",
    "let us consider a column @xmath94 .",
    "we replace the @xmath46 columns , with @xmath95 , at the right of @xmath94 , with one column @xmath96 of potts spins @xmath97 , having an effective horizontal coupling @xmath98 with the spins of @xmath94 .",
    "furthermore , adjacent spins @xmath99 are constrained to be in the same state , this last condition having the role to describe the ordered phase . the averaging process at the right of @xmath94 is then simulated by the summation over all configurations on @xmath96",
    ". the same procedure is applied at the left of @xmath94 , by introducing a column @xmath100 .",
    "so , we obtain the distribution @xmath101 where @xmath102 is a normalization constant and @xmath103 we are then led to the one - parameter ansatz @xmath104 in the ordered phase , given by @xmath105 we note that @xmath106 is a r.p.d .",
    "obtained from the distribution @xmath107 involving the strip @xmath108 .",
    "now , to @xmath109 is associated a @xmath110 transfer matrix @xmath111 , having many matrix elements equal to zero , due to the factors @xmath112 , @xmath113 .",
    "this allows to elude the p.f . theorem .",
    "in fact , the highest eigenvalue of @xmath114 is @xmath1 times degenerate ; we have that @xmath114 is the direct sum of the @xmath1 blocks made by the same @xmath115 matrix , @xmath116 and of the @xmath117 blocks @xmath118 made also by @xmath115 coincident matrices , which differ from the previous ones .",
    "the highest eigenvalue of @xmath114 is contained in the blocks @xmath119 , which are associated to the @xmath1 ordered phases , while @xmath120 are related to the occurrence of a surface tension between different phases .",
    "the problem of selecting a particular @xmath119 is physically equivalent to apply an external field @xmath121 to the spin state @xmath122 , on the boundaries @xmath100 and @xmath96 , to take the limit @xmath93 and then to consider the limit @xmath123 .",
    "once this selection of a particular @xmath122 has been made , we see from that the horizontal effective coupling @xmath124 gives rise to an external field @xmath125 , applied on @xmath94 to the spin state @xmath122 , obtaining then the long range order relative to the @xmath122 phase .",
    "so , we see that our parameter @xmath124 has a role analogous to the effective field of the mean field theory . by modulating through @xmath124 the rigid boundary conditions on @xmath100 and @xmath96",
    ", @xmath104 provides the simplest description of the phase having a temperature dependent order parameter .",
    "as we did for the disordered phase , we can improve @xmath104 through the action of @xmath69 .",
    "so , in the ordered region , we have the sequence of one - parameter ansatz s for @xmath41 @xmath126 and the relative r.r .",
    "quotients @xmath127 it is useful to point out that @xmath104 can be written in the form @xmath128 and that @xmath129 is the partition function of a potts@xmath130 model on a strip @xmath131 of @xmath8 rows and @xmath132 columns , with the same coupling as the original model , except for the first and last column of sites , where we have a vertical n.n .",
    "coupling of infinite strength , and for the first and last column of rows where we have an horizontal n.n .",
    "coupling of strength @xmath124 .",
    "this model provides an approximate description @xmath133 of the r.p.d .",
    "@xmath80 in the ordered phase .    to the potts@xmath130",
    "is associated a @xmath134 transfer matrix @xmath135 having properties analogous to that of the previous @xmath136 .",
    "if we call @xmath137 its highest eigenvalue , we obtain the sequence of estimates @xmath138 of @xmath59 in the form @xmath139 by taking a vector @xmath140 of the sequence and a vector @xmath141 of the sequence , we obtain an ansatz @xmath142 with two _ charts _ , providing the estimates of @xmath59 , given by @xmath143 and @xmath144 respectively .",
    "these two functions are defined for any @xmath63 .",
    "for each @xmath63 , the choice between the two descriptions is made by a further application of the variational method , that is by considering @xmath145 we will say that two vectors @xmath140 and @xmath141 are exactly compatible if it happens that @xmath143 and @xmath144 match exactly at the transition point @xmath13 . in the next section , we will show that such vectors exist .",
    "a crucial property of the 2d potts model is the duality relation which connects the partition function in the high and low - temperature regions . in terms of the free energy ,",
    "it states that @xcite @xmath146 where @xmath147 and @xmath148 , the point _",
    "dual _ of @xmath63 , is defined by @xmath149 the equation is an exact analytic constraint , allowing the location of the transition point @xmath13 ( given by @xmath150 ) on the basis of the non - analyticity of @xmath59 at this point @xcite .",
    "however , besides this formal aspect , we have no trace , in the above relation , of the mechanism leading to a transition from the disordered to the ordered phase .",
    "now , we will see that further insights and additional aspects of duality are provided by the variational method , by means of the ansatz s introduced in the previous section .",
    "first of all we remark that , due to the fact that the ordered and disordered regions are described by a unique vector @xmath41 for finite @xmath8 , the two _ charts _ of a proper ansatz should share some common property , as an expression of their common origin . as a matter of fact",
    "there is a property that allows to associate univocally @xmath151 with @xmath152 , leading us to consider , as proper ansatz s with two _ charts _ , the sequence @xmath153 and then the sequence of estimates @xmath154 for @xmath59 , given by @xmath155 this property , shared by @xmath151 and @xmath156 , is an algebraic structure , as it will be shown in the following .",
    "we first consider @xmath157 , for @xmath158 .",
    "we have seen that this vector defines the potts@xmath75 model on a strip @xmath159 .",
    "let us call @xmath160 a spin configuration on a row of @xmath159 .",
    "the transfer matrix @xmath161 , which connects two adjacent rows , can be written in the form @xcite @xmath162 with @xmath163 where @xmath164 and @xmath165 are @xmath81 matrices defined by @xmath166 they satisfy the relations @xmath167    these relations define the temperley - lieb algebra generated by @xmath168 , and then all the eigenvalues of @xmath82 , with exception of their degeneracies .",
    "now we come to @xmath169 , which defines the potts@xmath130 model .",
    "it is useful to consider this model as the limit , for @xmath170 , of potts@xmath171 , obtained through the substitution of @xmath104 with @xmath172 of the equation .",
    "then , following the previous procedure , we have that to potts@xmath173 is associated a @xmath81 transfer matrix @xmath174 , which can be written in the form @xmath175 with @xmath176 where @xmath177 taking the limit @xmath170 , we obtain @xmath178 with @xmath179 so , the matrices @xmath180 and @xmath181 being suppressed by the limiting procedure , we remain only with the @xmath182 matrices @xmath183 .",
    "however , if we define @xmath184 we see from , that these @xmath185 matrices @xmath186 satisfy the same algebraic relations which are satisfied by the @xmath187 matrices @xmath188 .",
    "we only have with the @xmath189 a representation of different dimensionality of the same algebraic structure .",
    "together with the structure of @xmath190 and @xmath191 , this is the common property which allows to couple the vector @xmath192 with the vector @xmath193 , leading then to the sequence .    as a matter of fact",
    ", it follows from , , , and that the eigenvalues of @xmath190 coincide with those of @xmath194 , where @xmath195 is defined by @xmath196 in particular , we have @xmath197 which is a duality relation for the partition function of potts@xmath198 and potts@xmath199 .    as a consequence ,",
    "coming back to the variational method , we obtain the duality relation for the r.r .",
    "quotients @xmath200 since , as @xmath124 goes from zero to @xmath201 , @xmath195 goes from @xmath201 to @xmath202 , we deduce from , , that @xmath203 or , equivalently , @xmath204 the relative @xmath39 being attained at _ dual _ points , according to .",
    "so @xmath151 and @xmath156 are exactly compatible .",
    "the equation is the variational version of .",
    "indeed , from it follows that @xmath205 therefore , if at a point @xmath63 we have , for example , @xmath206 , then at the dual point it results that @xmath207 .",
    "so we conclude that the estimates @xmath154 given by , satisfy exactly the duality relation , that is @xmath208 we see that the mechanism of non - analyticity at @xmath13 can be described as a crossing phenomenon , involving @xmath209 and @xmath210 .",
    "the above results can be extended to two - parameters ansatz , which are useful to consider both from the computational and variational point of view .    to fix our ideas ,",
    "let us suppose that we need to go beyond the estimates @xmath211 and @xmath212 .",
    "we can consider then @xmath213 . the relative calculations require strips of four and five columns , to be compared with the case of three and four columns needed for @xmath212 .",
    "however we can also improve @xmath212 without changing the number of columns and the size of the involved transfer matrices , but by adding a further parameter .",
    "in fact , by making use of the procedure of an approximate description of the averaging process , we can introduce the two - parameters ansatz for @xmath41 @xmath214 with @xmath215 .",
    "then , by considering @xmath216 , we are led to the estimate of @xmath217 @xmath218 where @xmath219 are the partition functions of the potts models shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we deduce from and @xmath220 we can improve analogously @xmath221 , which is determined through @xmath222 , by introducing the two - parameter ansatz @xmath223 with @xmath224 where @xmath225 is given by . through @xmath226 , we obtain the estimate @xmath227 where @xmath228 are the partition functions of the potts models shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) .    by making use again of the generators of the temperley - lieb algebra we have , as in , @xmath229 so that also the estimate of @xmath59",
    ", @xmath230 satisfies the duality relation . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the parameters @xmath124 and @xmath231 are the _ dual _ expression of @xmath86 and @xmath232 , respectively .    in principle , further improved two - parameters ansatz s can be obtained from the action of@xmath233 on the vector @xmath234 , leading to the sequence of estimates @xmath235 .",
    "now we discuss the effective aspects of the variational method presented in the previous sections , by considering the estimates of lower order .",
    "we have calculated explicitly @xmath236 and @xmath237 , obtaining then @xmath238 and @xmath239 , according to and .",
    "we have also considered @xmath240 , which does not have a _ dual _ partner in our scheme , but , in any case , allows to obtain the simplest approximation to @xmath59 , for every @xmath63 . as a matter of fact",
    ", @xmath240 has a finite absolute maximum point @xmath241 for @xmath242 , while for @xmath243 the absolute maximum is taken at @xmath244 .",
    "these points are also relative maximum points in a neighbourhood of @xmath245 , at its right and at its left , respectively .",
    "@xmath245 is an estimate of the transition point @xmath13 ; at @xmath245 we have a crossing between @xmath246 and @xmath247 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath249 satisfies quite well , even if approximately , the duality relation , when @xmath1 is large . as a matter of fact , by making a comparison with the known exact results , we have that @xmath249 provides a quite reliable description , for every @xmath63 , of the properties of the 2d square potts model for @xmath250 , the description being more and more accurate as @xmath1 increases . in this respect",
    ", our simplest approximation behaves like mean field theory .",
    "however , from a quantitative point of view , we get a net improvement , since it turns out that the mean field estimates , which are exact in the limit @xmath18 , differ significantly from the known exact results already at @xmath1 of order @xmath251 . indeed , in the large @xmath1 expansions",
    ", we have power series in @xmath252 with very large coefficients @xcite , which are responsible of such deviations . in figures ( [ fig3])a and ( [ fig3])b we plot ,",

    "now the relations are also satisfied by the @xmath259 matrices @xmath260 given by @xcite @xmath261 @xmath262 , where @xmath263 , @xmath264 with @xmath265 .",
    "this is the 6-vertex representation of the temperley - lieb algebra .",
    "the eigenvalues of our reduced transfer matrices have been determined by making use of the representation , which allows to translate a potts strip @xmath45 into an ice - type ( or 6-vertex ) strip @xmath266 and , as a by - product , to consider also non integer values of @xmath1 .    as we had to expect , the results of our calculations show that @xmath13 is the only crossing point of @xmath210 with @xmath267 and also of @xmath268 with @xmath237 . furthermore @xmath269 for @xmath270 , so that @xmath271    . our predictions for the free energy @xmath272 , the internal energy in the disorder phase @xmath16 and the specific heat in the ordered phase @xmath273 calculated at the transition point @xmath13 .",

    ", we have to move from @xmath13 in order to get the same accuracy . in fig.([fig5 ] ) we plot @xmath301 and @xmath295 at @xmath282 , while in table [ table1 ] we give , for several @xmath1 , @xmath302 and @xmath303 , that is the previous estimates at @xmath13 , evaluated in the ordered phase ( the predictions for the disordered phase can be obtained from these through duality ) .    on the other hand , we obtain a considerable improvement in our estimates of the internal energy and of the specific heat for lower @xmath1 and @xmath63 very near to @xmath13 , by accelerating the convergence of the already rapidly convergent sequence of our estimates of the free energy . starting from @xmath304 , @xmath305 and @xmath239 and by making use of the aitken @xmath306 method ( or of the @xmath307 $ ] pad approximant ) ,",
    "we deduce the new extimate @xmath308 we call @xmath309 and @xmath310 the internal energy and the specific heat calculated through @xmath311 . the improvement which we obtain can be checked by comparing @xmath312 with the known exact value .",
    "we give in table [ table1 ] @xmath313 , @xmath312 and @xmath314 for several @xmath1 .",
    "we see that @xmath315 reproduces @xmath275 within the errors of @xmath316 and @xmath317 at @xmath280 and @xmath282 , respectively , a net improvement with respect @xmath287 .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath318 and @xmath295 are already quite reliable , @xmath311 does not lead to significant corrections . for @xmath282 and @xmath280 , the function @xmath319 is plotted in fig.([fig4])a and fig.([fig4])b , where its role is made quite evident .",
    "a stronger correction is obtained for specific heat , as shown in fig.([fig5 ] ) , where we plot @xmath310 , for @xmath282 .",
    "our estimate of @xmath320 for @xmath321 at @xmath282 , agrees essentially with the estimate of @xmath322 obtained from large-@xmath1 expansions @xcite , which is contradicted by the value @xmath323 deduced from low temperature series @xcite .",
    "for @xmath324 the results of ref .",
    "@xcite are confirmed quite well by our @xmath314 .",
    "so , we see that the variational approach presented in this paper , besides providing exact predictions and physical or mathematical mechanisms for the first order transition of our model ( for @xmath0 ) , is also very effective in the numerical predictions of unknown quantities",
    ". our numerical analysis will be completed in a future paper and will concern properties as spontaneous magnetization and susceptibility , which are accessible through low temperature series expansions @xcite , but not through large-@xmath1 expansions . on the other hand , since these two approaches",
    "give contradicting results in the case of specific heat , a further analysis of the estimates made in ref .",
    "@xcite would be appropriate .",
    "furthermore we will explore more completely the consequences of duality , which in the variational approach proposed here appears at a more fundamental level . through the reduced probability distributions and the variational parameters having dual partners",
    ", it is possible to study more completely the link between typical properties of the ordered and disordered phases",
    ".    our aim will be also to extend the above approach to the important case of the 3d potts model .",
