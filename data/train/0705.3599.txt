    "let @xmath2 be an @xmath3 integer symmetric matrix with characteristic polynomial @xmath4 .",
    "the aim of this paper is to describe all such matrices @xmath2 that have the maximum modulus of their eigenvalues at most @xmath5 .",
    "the significance of the bound @xmath5 is that , by a result of kronecker @xcite , every eigenvalue of such a matrix @xmath2 is then of the form @xmath6 , for some root of unity @xmath7 .",
    "thus @xmath8 is a cyclotomic polynomial .",
    "for this reason we call such integer symmetric matrices _ cyclotomic _ matrices .    in 1970",
    "smith @xcite classified all cyclotomic @xmath9-matrices with zeros on the diagonal , regarding them as adjacency matrices of graphs ( see figure [ f - except ] ) .",
    "such graphs were called _ cyclotomic _",
    "graphs in @xcite .",
    "it turns out that a full description of cyclotomic matrices is conveniently stated using more general graphs .",
    "so if we allow the off - diagonal elements of our matrix to be chosen from the set @xmath10 , we obtain a _ signed _ graph ( see @xcite,@xcite ) , a non - zero @xmath11th entry denoting a ` sign ' of @xmath12 or @xmath13 on the edge between vertices @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "further , for a general symmetric @xmath10 matrix , where now the diagonal entries may be nonzero , we obtain what we call a _ charged _ signed graph ; we regard a nonzero @xmath16th entry of @xmath2 as corresponding to a ` charge ' on its @xmath14th vertex .",
    "if none of the edges of a charged signed graph in fact have sign @xmath12 , then we have a charged ( unsigned ) graph .",
    "however , a graph is also a signed graph , and a signed graph is also a charged signed graph .",
    "the notion of a charged signed graph is a convenient device for picturing and discussing symmetric integer matrices with entries in @xmath10 .",
    "these are the most important matrices in our description of general cyclotomic matrices .    in this paper",
    "we extend smith s result to cyclotomic charged signed graphs ( theorem [ t - lcsg ] ) , and then , with little further work , to all cyclotomic matrices ( theorem [ t - ism ] ) . along the way we find all cyclotomic signed graphs ( theorem [ t - csg ] ) . as a consequence",
    ", we can also describe all cyclotomic charged graphs ( theorem [ t : unsigned_charged ] ) and all cyclotomic matrices whose entries are non - negative ( theorem [ t : nonnegative_matrix ] ) .    having obtained our results for the closed interval @xmath0 $ ] , it is then very natural to consider restricting the eigenvalues to the open interval @xmath1 . we give a complete classification of symmetric integer matrices with eigenvalues in this restricted set ( theorem [ t - ismopen ] ) . as in the case of the closed interval , there are corresponding results for cyclotomic signed graphs ( theorem [ t : open_signed ] ) , cyclotomic charged signed graphs ( theorem [ t : open_charged_signed ] ) , cyclotomic charged graphs ( theorem [ t : open_charged ] ) and cyclotomic matrices whose entries are non - negative ( theorem [ t : nonnegative_matrix_open ] ) . having dealt with the general cyclotomic case , this is a relatively straightforward problem .",
    "there is a connection here with the theory of finite reflection groups and their coxeter graphs , and we conclude with a discussion of this .    in @xcite , cyclotomic graphs were used to construct salem numbers and pisot numbers .",
    "the original motivation for this current work was that it provides one of the ingredients necessary to extend the work in @xcite .",
    "but we think that our results may be of independent interest .    throughout the paper , a _",
    "subgraph _ of the ( charged , signed ) graph under consideration will always mean a vertex - deleted subgraph , that is , an induced subgraph on a subset of the vertices .",
    "in order to state our results , we need some preliminaries . the matrix @xmath2 will be called _ indecomposable _ if and only if the underlying graph is _",
    "connected_. ( in the underlying graph , vertices @xmath14 and @xmath15 are adjacent if and only if the @xmath11th entry of @xmath2 is nonzero . )",
    "if @xmath2 is not indecomposable , then there is a reordering of the rows ( and columns ) such that the matrix has block diagonal form with more than one block , and its list of eigenvalues is found by pooling the lists of the eigenvalues of the blocks . for our classification of cyclotomic matrices , it is clearly sufficient to consider indecomposable ones .",
    "a repeatedly useful tool for us is cauchy s interlacing theorem ( for a short proof , see @xcite ) .",
    "[ l : interlacing ] let @xmath2 be a real symmetric matrix , with eigenvalues @xmath17 . pick any row @xmath14 , and let @xmath18 be the matrix formed by deleting row @xmath14 and column @xmath14 from @xmath2 .",
    "then the eigenvalues of @xmath18 interlace with those of @xmath2 : if @xmath18 has eigenvalues @xmath19 , then @xmath20    in view of this lemma , if @xmath2 is cyclotomic , then so is any matrix obtained by deleting from @xmath2 any number of its rows , along with the corresponding columns : we then speak of the smaller matrix as being _ contained in _ the larger one ( the smaller graph is an induced subgraph of the larger graph ) .",
    "we call an indecomposable cyclotomic matrix ( or its graph ) _ maximal _ if it is not contained in a strictly - larger indecomposable cyclotomic matrix : the corresponding cyclotomic graph is not an induced subgraph of a strictly larger connected cyclotomic graph .",
    "we shall see that every non - maximal indecomposable cyclotomic matrix is contained in a maximal one .",
    "it is therefore enough for us to classify all maximal indecomposable cyclotomic matrices .",
    "when we consider matrices that have all their eigenvalues in the open interval @xmath1 , we shall see that it is no longer always true that every such matrix is contained in a maximal one : there is an infinite family of indecomposable exceptions .",
    "denote by @xmath21 the orthogonal group of @xmath3 signed permutation matrices .",
    "then conjugation of a cyclotomic matrix by a matrix in @xmath21 gives a cyclotomic matrix with the same eigenvalues .",
    "we say that two @xmath3 cyclotomic matrices are _ strongly equivalent _ if they are related in this way .",
    "further , we say that two indecomposable cyclotomic matrices @xmath2 and @xmath22 are merely _ equivalent _ if @xmath22 is strongly equivalent to @xmath2 or @xmath23 .",
    "this notion then extends easily to decomposable cyclotomic matrices . both of these notions are equivalence relations on the set of all cyclotomic matrices . for indecomposable cyclotomic matrices ,",
    "the equivalence classes for the weaker notion are the union of one or two strong equivalence classes , depending on whether or not @xmath23 is in the same strong equivalence class as @xmath2 .",
    "it is clearly sufficient to classify all cyclotomic matrices up to equivalence .    for a charged signed graph ,",
    "the notions of strong equivalence and equivalence of course carry over via the adjacency matrix .",
    "now @xmath21 is generated by diagonal matrices of the form @xmath24 and by permutation matrices .",
    "conjugation by these diagonal matrices corresponds to reversing the signs of all edges incident at a certain vertex @xmath25 ; we call this _ switching at @xmath25_. conjugation by a permutation matrix merely means that we can ignore vertex labels ; we therefore do not label the vertices of our graphs .",
    "thus for unlabelled charged signed graphs , strong equivalence classes are generated only by such switching operations .",
    "the concept of switching , and signed switching classes , appeared earlier for signed graphs in @xcite .",
    "equivalence of charged signed graphs is generated both by switching , and by the operation of reversing all the edge signs and vertex charges of a component of a graph .",
    "since most of our graphs will in fact be signed graphs , we avoid clutter by drawing edges with sign @xmath13 as unbroken lines  , and edges with sign @xmath12 as dashed lines - - - - - - . for vertices ,",
    "those of charge @xmath26 will be drawn , @xmath27 , respectively , with the vertices @xmath27 without a charge being called _ neutral _ vertices .",

    ", we use the same notation for a graph and its associated cyclotomic polynomial .    for computing formulae for families of associated cyclotomic polynomials , a standard tool will be to use induction on the determinant @xmath502 , where @xmath2 is the adjacency matrix of the graph under consideration . in this way it is easy first to compute the the @xmath49-vertex ( unsigned ) path @xmath496 ,",
    "giving @xmath503 , as in the table ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "then expansion by the first row of the determinant gives @xmath504 .",
    "also @xmath443 is readily calculated , again expanding in the same way .    for @xmath428 ,",
    "determinant expansion firstly along the top row , and then down the left rows of the resulting determinants gives @xmath505 , and hence the result .    for @xmath390 , the formulae for @xmath439 and @xmath506 can be proved by induction , using the determinant , in a similar way to that for @xmath507 .",

    "the coxeter graph of a simple system is determined by the reflection group , and provides a means of classifying finite reflection groups .",
    "if we have a signed graph with all eigenvalues in @xmath1 then ( as we have seen ) its vertices can be associated with a linearly independent set @xmath526 of vectors , and the reflection group generated by the hyperplanes orthogonal to those vectors is a finite reflection group .",
