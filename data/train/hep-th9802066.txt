    "confinement of the elementary degrees of freedom is a fundamental property of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "it has been subject of many investigations , and a variety of mechanisms have been proposed for its explanation .",
    "here we mention as particularly relevant for our present work the restriction in the range of the functional integration due to the presence of gribov horizons in gauge fixed formulations @xcite , or the appearance and possible condensation of magnetic monopoles in abelian projected descriptions @xcite . despite considerable analytical and numerical efforts and largely due to the gauge dependence of most of the discussed mechanisms , no definite picture has yet emerged nor have interrelations between these mechanisms been established .",
    "the focus of our study of the confining phase of qcd will be on the center symmetry @xcite and the associated order - fields , the polyakov loop variables @xcite .",
    "irrespective of the details of the dynamics which give rise to confinement , this symmetry must be realized in the confining and spontaneously broken in the `` quark - gluon plasma '' phase .",
    "unlike in lattice gauge calculations , the issue of the center symmetry has essentially played no role in analytical investigations so far . in general ,",
    "perturbative calculations break this symmetry and thus inevitably are guided towards the deconfined phase .",
    "this is due to the change of the underlying gauge symmetry from su(@xmath0 ) to u(1)@xmath1 when the coupling vanishes . in this limit ,",
    "the original z@xmath2 symmetry gets effectively broken .",
    "for the center symmetry to be preserved in the path integral formulation , the faddeev ",
    "popov determinant @xcite arising in the process of gauge fixing can not be treated perturbatively .",
    "in particular the associated restrictions in the range of integrations which prevent summation over gribov copies can not be neglected .",
    "likewise , for the center symmetry to be preserved in the canonical formalism , the gauss law has to be resolved non - perturbatively .",
    "only then the center symmetry is guaranteed to appear as the correct residual gauge symmetry .    for the formulation of the center symmetry and definition of the polyakov loops we consider qcd at finite extension , i.e. , in a geometry where the system is of finite extent ( @xmath3 ) in one direction ( @xmath4 ) , but of infinite extent in the other directions ( coordinates denoted by @xmath5 ) .",
    "choosing one compact coordinate is of interest for additional reasons .",
    "first , the parameter @xmath3 helps to control infrared ambiguities .",
    "this is of particular importance when using axial like gauges ( for an early discussion of ambiguities in the axial gauge , see ref .",
    "second , by covariance , qcd at finite extension is equivalent to finite temperature qcd and , therefore , the essential properties of finite extension qcd are known from finite temperature lattice gauge calculations ( for a recent review , cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in particular the presence of a phase transition at finite temperature implies , via covariance , occurrence of a phase transition when compressing the system , i.e. , decreasing @xmath3 .",
    "it also implies dimensional reduction to @xmath6 dimensional qcd to occur @xcite if the system is compressed far beyond the typical length scale of strong interaction physics .",
    "although identification of the compact direction with imaginary time is more familiar , we will use the finite extension interpretation by making a spatial direction compact . in this case , the canonical formulation is straightforward , and the center symmetry plays the role of an ordinary symmetry",
    ".    the variables of central importance in our investigation of the center symmetry are the polyakov loops winding around the compact 3-direction .",
    "these variables characterize the phases of qcd ( cf . @xcite for finite temperature qcd ) , in particular the realization of the center symmetry in the absence of quarks .",
    "thereby they serve as order parameters of the confinement - deconfinement transition occuring at a certain critical extension .    besides the choice of the geometry , the choice of gauge is the second important technical ingredient on which our investigations are based . with one of the space - time directions made compact",
    ", the use of an axial type gauge seems natural .",
    "moreover in such a gauge the polyakov loop variables appear as elementary rather than composite degrees of freedom .",
    "this makes the whole setting particularly appropriate for a study of the center symmetry and of the dynamics of the polyakov loops .",
    "indeed the center symmetry will remain present at each level of the theoretical development .",
    "this is possible only because the elimination of redundant variables can be performed in closed form without invoking at any step perturbation theory .",
    "realization of the center symmetry implies the presence of novel structural elements as compared to standard perturbative qcd .",
    "in particular , the center symmetric phase with its infinite energies associated with single static color charges does not exhibit , as might be expected , the phenomenon of ( chromo - electric ) debye screening @xcite .",
    "rather , naive application of perturbation theory will be seen to lead to tachyonic behaviour of the polyakov loop variables .",
    "this perturbative instability indicates qualitative changes in the structure of the vacuum which will be shown to arise from the ultralocality of the polyakov loops .",
    "ultralocality , i.e. , the missing strength to generate wave phenomena , represents an extreme form of confinement of these degrees of freedom .",
    "this property will provide an appropriate framework for the discussion of a variety of non - perturbative , confinement related phenomena . on the other hand , these drastic deviations in the polyakov loop vacuum from the perturbative one necessarily obscure the standard short distance perturbative properties of qcd .",
    "this dichotomy between perturbative and non - perturbative physics will be illustrated by a detailed discussion of the interaction energy of static quarks . in this approach to the polyakov loop dynamics , certain non - perturbative infrared properties are almost trivial consequences of the vacuum structure , while description of the short distance , coulomb - like behaviour will be seen to require coupling of polyakov loops to other gluonic variables to infinite order .",
    "aside from the introduction and conclusions , this paper is organized into three main sections . in sect .",
    "2 , the qcd generating functional is derived in a modified axial gauge , using a space with finite extension in the 3-direction .",
    "path integral quantization is used to rederive in a self - contained and streamlined fashion results of our earlier canonical studies ( sect .",
    "2.2 ) , the main emphasis being on the su(2 ) case ( sect .",
    "we have also included a brief reminder on the equivalence of finite temperature and finite extension field theory ( sect .",
    "2.1 ) and illustrated the difficulties encountered in the evaluation of screening effects , if one tries to treat the faddeev  popov determinant perturbatively ( sect .",
    "section 3 addresses the issue of polyakov loops and exhibits ultralocality as their main characteristics . in sect .",
    "3.2 , we show how one can make use of this property of the polyakov loops to integrate them out , thereby deriving an effective theory for the other degrees of freedom which admits a continuum limit . a qualitative discussion of the phases of qcd ( sect .",
    "3.3 ) and the confinement - deconfinement transition ( sect .",
    "3.4 ) , as they appear in this novel description , follow . sect .",

    "4.1 ) and the gluon two - point function ( sect .  4.3 ) and polyakov loop correlator at one ( sect .",
    "4.2 ) and two loop level ( sect .",
    "4.4 ) are discussed in detail , emphasizing the short distance aspects .",
    "these investigations are then used to gain insight into the interaction between static quarks ( sect .",
    "4.5 ) as well as shielding effects in the presence of dynamical quarks ( sect .",
    "the two appendices contain material of technical nature referred to in the main text , namely the calculation of the electron self energy in axial gauge qed ( appendix a ) and the full expressions for the one loop gluon self energy in modified axial gauge qcd ( appendix b ) .",
    "before developing the formalism for axial gauge qcd we briefly discuss the relation between qcd at finite extension and finite temperature .",
    "the equivalence of relativistic field theories at finite extension and finite temperature has been noted in ref .",
    "@xcite and used e.g. in a discussion of the finite temperature quark propagators @xcite . by rotational invariance in the euclidean ,",
    "the value of the partition function of a system with finite extension @xmath3 in 3 direction and @xmath7 in 0 direction is invariant under the exchange of these two extensions , @xmath8 provided bosonic ( fermionic ) fields satisfy periodic ( antiperiodic ) boundary conditions in both time and 3 coordinate .",
    "thus relativistic covariance connects the thermodynamic properties of a canonical ensemble with the properties of the pure state of the vacuum corresponding to the same physical system but at finite extension .",
    "in particular , as a consequence of ( 1 ) , energy density and pressure are related by @xmath9 for a system of non - interacting particles this relation connects energy density or pressure of the stefan boltzmann law with the corresponding quantities measured in the casimir effect .    in qcd , by covariance , the existence of a phase transition at finite temperature implies the occurrence of a phase transition when compressing the qcd vacuum ( i.e. , decreasing @xmath10 ) . from this point of view , the confinement - deconfinement phase transition or the chiral phase transition , when quarks are present , appear as `` quantum phase transitions '' ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "they are driven by changes in quantum rather than thermal fluctuations which in turn are induced by changes of a parameter of the system ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "covariance connects quantitatively compressed and heated systems with each other .",
    "in particular , we conclude from eq .",
    "( [ fe2 ] ) that in the phase transition induced by compressing the system the casimir pressure changes discontinuously , while the change in the energy density is continuous .",
    "furthermore , from results of lattice gauge calculations @xcite , we infer that this transition occurs at a critical extension @xmath11 fm in the absence of quarks and at @xmath12 fm when quarks are included .",
    "these typical length scales indicate that we do not have to treat the extension strictly as an infrared parameter which tends to infinity .",
    "rather we expect no essential property of the qcd vacuum to be changed significantly if @xmath3 is of the order of 23 fm . for extensions smaller than @xmath13 ,",
    "the energy density and pressure reach values which are typically 80 % of the corresponding  casimir \" energy and pressure . if the system is compressed further and the extension becomes much smaller than typical length scales of strong interaction physics ( e.g. a typical hadron radius @xmath14 ) , we expect correlation functions at transverse momenta or energies @xmath15 to be dominated by the zero  matsubara wave numbers \" in 3-direction and thus to be given by the dimensionally reduced qcd@xmath16 .",
    "lattice calculations @xcite provide evidence for this dimensional reduction to occur if one of the euclidean extensions becomes small .",
    "the variables of central importance in our investigation of the role of the center symmetry are the polyakov loops winding around the compact 3-direction @xmath17 the vacuum expectation values of @xmath18 characterizes the phases of qcd ( cf .",
    "@xcite for finite temperature qcd ) , in particular their realization of the center symmetry in the absence of quarks .",
    "thereby they serve as order parameters of the confinement - deconfinement transition occurring when varying the extension .      for the theoretical treatment of qcd at finite extension or finite temperature",
    "an axial type gauge is particularly appropriate . in such gauges ,",
    "the associated polyakov loops appear as fundamental rather than composite degrees of freedom ; this in turn permits a direct study of the dynamics of the order parameter for the confinement - deconfinement transition .",
