    "the standard model ( sm ) has been very successful for more than thirty years .",
    "only recently have some deviations from the sm surfaced in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 measurements at lep @xcite and in the high @xmath2 inclusive jet production recorded by cdf @xcite . since we have no true knowledge of the structure or even the symmetry of the correct high energy theory , we use the effective lagrangian approach to study low energy phenomena .",
    "deviations from the sm can be studied systematically by means of an effective lagrangian , which is made up of the sm fields and obeys the symmetry of the low energy theory .",
    "the leading terms are simply given by the sm and consist of dimension-4 operators while the higher order terms consist of higher - dimension operators and are suppressed by powers of the scale @xmath3 of the new physics . in other words , if the scale @xmath3 is much larger than the present scale the theory is essentially the same as the sm .    among all the dimension-5 operators , the most interesting ones involving quarks and gluons are the chromomagnetic ( cmdm ) and chromoelectric ( cedm ) dipole moment couplings of quarks .",
    "they are given by @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "although these couplings are zero at tree level within the sm , they can be induced in loop levels . in many extensions of the sm , they are easily nonzero at one - loop level or even tree - level , e.g. , the multi - higgs doublet model @xcite .",
    "these dipole moment couplings are important not only because they are only suppressed by one power of @xmath3 , but also because a nonzero value for the cedm moment is a clean signal for cp violation .",
    "the effects of these anomalous couplings have been studied quite extensively , e.g. , in @xmath6 production @xcite , in @xmath7 production @xcite , and in inclusive jet production @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the effects of the anomalous cmdm and cedm of quarks on prompt photon production .",
    "prompt photon production has been known to be a useful probe to the gluon luminosity inside a hadron because they are mainly produced by quark - gluon scattering .",
    "the fact that the production depends on the quark - gluon vertex also makes the process sensitive to the anomalous couplings of quarks to gluons . not only is the total cross section affected but also the differential distributions , e.g. , the transverse momentum distribution .",
    "both cdf@xcite and d0@xcite have measurements on prompt photon production .",
    "we can therefore use the data to constrain these cmdm and cedm couplings .",
    "thus , the bounds obtained will be the main result of the paper .",
    "the organization is as follows . in the next section",
    ", we shall write down the effective lagrangian and the formulas for the calculation . in sec .",
    "iii we study the effects on the transverse momentum distribution , and obtain the results . in sec .",
    "iv we estimate the limits of these anomalous couplings that can be probed in the future collider experiments .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "the effective lagrangian for the interactions between a quark and a gluon that include the cedm and cmdm form factors is @xmath8 q \\;.\\ ] ] where @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) is the cmdm ( cedm ) of the quark @xmath11 .",
    "the feynman rules for the interactions of quarks and gluons can be written down : @xmath12 q_i\\ ; g_\\mu^a \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the incoming ( outgoing ) quark and @xmath14 is the 4-momentum of the outgoing gluon .",
    "the lagrangian in eq .",
    "( [ eff ] ) also induces a @xmath15 interaction given by @xmath16 which is absent in the sm . in the following , we write @xmath17 which are given in units of ( gev)@xmath18 .",
    "the contributing processes are : @xmath19 the contributing feynman diagrams are shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the spin- and color - averaged amplitude for @xmath20 is given by @xmath21\\ ] ] where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the electric charge of the quark @xmath11 in units of the proton charge .",
    "similarly , the spin- and color - averaged amplitude for @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 \\;.\\ ] ] the subprocess cross section is then given by @xmath26 which is then folded with the appropriate parton distribution functions .",
    "we use the cteq2 m parton distribution functions@xcite and the two - loop formula for the strong coupling constant .",
    "although the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) calculation to prompt photon production exists , there is , however , no nlo calculation that includes cmdm and cedm couplings .",
    "therefore , throughout the paper we employ only the leading order ( lo ) calculation .",
    "but in calculating the fractional difference from the pure qcd cross section we shall use a k - factor to multiply the lo qcd cross sections by .",
    "the procedures will be illustrated in the next section .",
    "we first study the effects of nonzero cmdm and cedm on the transverse momentum spectrum of the photon . in order to compare with experimental data we have to impose a similar set of acceptance cuts as cdf and d0 did .",
    "for both cdf and d0 data we use @xmath27 where the @xmath28 cut is used to imitate the complicated experimental isolation procedures . in our lo calculation , the value of this @xmath28 cut is not crucial to our analysis .",
    "we have included the quark flavors : @xmath29 in our calculation and assumed that their anomalous couplings are the same . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we show the differential cross sections of prompt photon production versus the transverse momentum of the photon . the lo qcd curve has to be multiplied by a factor of about 1.3 to best fit the cdf data .",
    "therefore , we shall use a k - factor @xmath30 for the lo qcd cross section .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] also shows curves with nonzero values of cmdm .",
    "we can see that nonzero @xmath31 will increase the total and the differential cross sections , especially , in the large @xmath32 region .",
    "thus , the transverse momentum spectrum becomes harder with nonzero cmdm .",
    "the effects due to nonzero cedm will be the same because the increase in cross sections is proportional to @xmath33 .",
    "this is different from the case of @xmath6 production @xcite , in which the increase has a term proportional to the first power of @xmath34 .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the fractional differences from pure qcd for nonzero cmdm .",
    "the data are from cdf and d0 .",
    "the anomalous behavior at the low @xmath32 has already been resolved by including initial and final state shower radiation . for our case",
    "we are only interested in the large @xmath32 region . since in eqs .",
    "( [ amp1 ] ) and ( [ amp2 ] ) the role of @xmath31 and @xmath35 are the same , we can put one of them to be zero when we obtain bounds on the other .",
    "we show a few curves with different values of @xmath31 . from these curves",
    "we can see that the cdf and d0 data would be inconsistent with @xmath36 , therefore , giving a bound of @xmath37 on the cmdm of quarks .",
    "similarly , we put a bound of @xmath38 on the cedm of quarks . furthermore",
    ", this bound is also valid for the case that the photon - quark coupling is anomalous instead of the gluon - quark coupling .",
    "we also found that the normalized angular distribution in @xmath39 ( @xmath40 is the angle of the outgoing photon in the cm frame of the incoming partons ) is not affected appreciably by the presence of the anomalous dipole moments .",
    "we compare these with the results obtained in ref.@xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath31 obtained in fitting to the cdf@xcite transverse energy distribution of the inclusive jet production without adjusting the gluon parton distribution function is @xcite @xmath41 which is consistent with the bound obtained in this paper .",
    "the next run ( run ii ) at the tevatron will be at @xmath42 tev with an integrated luminosity of @xmath43 .",
    "if the run ii is stretched to a longer run it could accumulate a luminosity of about @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "there is also a plan called tev33 @xcite after run ii , in which the luminosity gets a further boost to about @xmath45 . at about the same time",
    "scale the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) will operate at @xmath46 tev with an initial yearly luminosity of @xmath44 , which will later increase to the designed luminosity of @xmath47 . in this section , we shall estimate the sensitivities of @xmath48 or the limits on @xmath3 that can be probed in these future experiments .",
    "we shall use a simple approach to calculate the limits .    without a full monte carlo of the detector including energy determination errors ,",
    "we treat here only the statistical sensitivity of the various experiments .",
    "our criteria@xcite is to take bins of appropriate size for the energy range being examined , and find the @xmath49 called @xmath50 at which the sm cross section statistical error bars are 10%",
    ". these will be the bins with 100 sm events .",
    "we then explore the cross section due to the sm plus the anomalous chromomagnetic moment contribution , and find the value of @xmath51 or @xmath3 where the excess over the sm is 10% at this @xmath50 .",
    "in table i we show the @xmath50 and @xmath52 for various experiments @xcite .",
    "we have used only the leading order cross sections without a @xmath53 factor to determine @xmath50 and @xmath3 .",
    "since the @xmath49 distribution is steeply falling , so with or without a @xmath53 factor would not affect significantly the values for @xmath50 and @xmath3 .",
    "actually , the experimental determination of @xmath49 might be the largest systematic errors among all @xcite .",
    "we have also imposed cuts on the isolated photon by @xmath54 and @xmath55 at the tevatron energies , while @xmath56 and @xmath57 for the lhc .",
    "we can see from the table that @xmath3 sensitivity scales roughly with the machine energy , but scales with about the eighth root of the luminosity .",
    "we have studied the effects of anomalous chromomagnetic and chromoelectric dipole moment couplings of light quarks on prompt photon production .",
    "the increase in cross sections is proportional to @xmath58 .",
    "these couplings increase the total cross section and the transverse momentum spectrum , especially at the large @xmath32 region . using the cdf and d0 data we found a bound @xmath31 or @xmath59 on the chromomagnetic or chromoelectric dipole moment of light quarks , which is the main result of the paper . in addition",
    ", we have also estimated the sensitivity of @xmath60 in the future collider experiments at the tevatron and lhc .",
    "the sensitivity is shown to be scaled roughly with the machine energy , but with the eighth root of the luminosity .",
    "for example , the run ii at the tevatron can probe @xmath61 in the range @xmath62 tev for integrated luminosities of @xmath63 , while the lhc can probe up to 6 tev with a @xmath47 luminosity .",
    "a similar table for @xmath3 from high transverse energy jet production has been presented in k. cheung and d. silverman , in _ proceedings of the 1996 dpf / dpb summer study on new direction for high energy physics _ , snowmass co , 1996 ( hep - ph/9609454 ) ."
