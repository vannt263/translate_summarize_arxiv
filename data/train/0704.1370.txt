    "the investigation of time dependent entropy of the quantum mechanical systems attracts much attention in recent years . for both open and closed quantum systems ,",
    "the different information - theoretic entropy measures have been discussed  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the joint entropy  @xcite can also be used to measure the loss of information , related to evolving pure quantum states  @xcite .",

    "@xcite , the joint entropy of the quantum mechanical systems increase monotonically with time but this results are not sufficient for simple harmonic oscillator  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this study is to calculate the complete joint entropy information analytically for simple harmonic and damped harmonic oscillator systems .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we explain fundamental definitions needed for the calculations . in section iii",
    ", we deal with calculation and results for harmonic oscillator systems .",
    "moreover , we obtain the analytical solution of kernel , wave function in both coordinate and momentum space and its joint entropy .",
    "we also obtain same quantities for damped harmonic oscillator case . finally , we present the conclusion in section iv .",
    "we deal with a classical system with @xmath0 degrees of freedom , where n is the particle number and s is number of spatial dimensions  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the density function @xmath1 which is the non - negative time dependent phase space density function of the system has been normalized to unity , @xmath2 the gibbs - shannon entropy is described by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the planck constant .",

    "depends on harmonic functions ( e.g sine or cosine function ) .",
    "therefore , other properties of the sho systems indicate the same harmonic behavior .",
    "if the frequency of the sho is sufficiently small , the system shows the same behavior as the free particle@xcite . as seen from fig.[eps3 ] and fig.[eps4 ] , envelop of the sinusoidal curve is also monotonically increase with omega and constant with time at constant omega , respectively .",
    "when the frequency increases , the joint entropy of this system indicates a fluctuation with increasing amplitude with time .",
    "if t goes to zero , it is important that eq.(20 ) is in agreement with following general inequality for the joint entropy : @xmath40 originally derived by leipnik for arbitrary one - dimensional one - particle wave functions .",
    "the dho is very important physical system in all physical systems defining an interaction with its environment .",

    "however , when the @xmath72 , the joint entropy has remarkably different features of the sho . as can be seen in fig.[eps7 ] and fig.[eps8 ] , the joint entropy of the dho has very interesting properties .",
    "one of the most important properties of the joint entropy is the probability of taking values for small @xmath68 values .",
    "as we know from literature the joint entropy must be positive and monotonically increase.however , this system has different properties from literature because of periodically discontinuity of the joint entropy .",
    "on the other hand , envelop of this curve is also monotonically increase with time for large @xmath68 .",
    "as can be shown these results , the envelop of the joint entropy curves has general properties as monotonically increase for quantum systems .",
    "thus , we have found that the joint entropy is depend on properties of investigated system .",
    "we have investigated the joint entropy for explicit time dependent solution of one - dimensional harmonic oscillators .",
    "we have obtained the time dependent wave function by means of feynmann path integral technique .",
    "our results show that in the simple harmonic oscillator case , the joint entropy fluctuated with time and frequency .",
    "this result indicates that the information periodically transfer between harmonic oscillators .    on the other hand , in the dho case",
    ", the joint entropy shows a remarkable smooth discontinuities with time .",
    "it also depends on choice of initial values of parameter i.e. @xmath73 .",
    "these results can be explained as the information exchange between harmonic oscillator and system which is supplied damping .",
    "but the information exchange appears in certain values of time for damping .",
    "if the damping factor increases , the information entropy has not periodicity anymore .",
    "moreover , for certain values of the damping factor , the transfer of information between systems is exhausted .",
