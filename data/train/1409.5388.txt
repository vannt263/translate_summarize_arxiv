    "the continuous spontaneous localization ( csl ) non - relativistic theory of dynamical collapse @xcite,@xcite is over two decades old @xcite .",
    "it adds a term to schrdinger s equation , which then includes the collapse of the state vector in its dynamics .",
    "thus , csl describes the occurrence of events , unlike standard quantum theory , which invokes a non - dynamical ` collapse postulate ' to account for events .",
    "the added term depends upon a random field @xmath3 .",
    "one or another realization of @xmath3 drives a superposition of states differing in mass density toward one or another of these states ( the collapse ) , thereby accounting for the world we see around us , which consists of well - localized mass density . a second equation , called the ` probability rule ' specifies the probability that nature chooses a particular @xmath3 , with the result that the collapse obeys the born rule .",
    "csl theory contains two parameters , a collapse rate @xmath0 and a mesoscopic distance @xmath4 .",
    "suppose a state vector is in a superposition of two states describing a single nucleon at two different locations , with separation @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath6 , then the superposition collapses at the rate @xmath7 . if @xmath8 , the collapse rate is @xmath9 .",
    "the collapse rate of a state vector describing any number of particles is likewise dependent upon these parameters .",
    "when the superposed states differ macroscopically in mass density , the collapse rate is proportional to @xmath0 and to the square of the integrated mass density differences , so that it is much larger than @xmath0 .",
    "if the theory is correct , the values of the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath4 should be determined by experiment . provisionally the parameter values chosen by ghirardi , rimini and weber @xcite in their instantaneous collapse theory , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , have been adopted .",
    "however , it should be mentioned that adler @xcite has given an argument for @xmath0 to be as large as @xmath12 ( and @xmath13 cm ) . in adler",
    "s work , as well as in recent articles by feldmann and tumulka @xcite and bassi et .",
    "al.@xcite , the present and proposed experimental situation has been reviewed .",
    "currently , the upper limit provided by experiments is @xmath14sec@xmath2@xcite .",
    "testing of the theory consists of performing experiments which can yield better limits on the csl parameters .",
    "either a discrepancy with the predictions of standard quantum theory will appear , validating the theory , or the limits will be such that the theory can no longer be considered viable .",
    "for example , this would occur if @xmath0 is restricted to be too small , so that the theory does not remove macroscopic superpositions rapidly enough to account for our observations of localized objects .",
    "such a condition was termed a  theoretical constraint \" by collett et .",
    "al.@xcite and is referred to by feldmann and tumulka@xcite as representing aphilosophically unsatisfactory \" condition .",
    "one situation where csl makes different predictions than standard quantum theory is the case of bound states . here",
    ", csl predicts ` spontaneous excitation ' : particles will , with a small probability , become excited .",
    "this is because the collapse narrows wave functions , and because a slightly narrowed bound state wave function automatically implies that the state vector becomes the superposition of the initial state plus a small component of all other accessible states .",
    "then , governed by the usual hamiltonian evolution which acts alongside the collapse evolution , the electrons in atoms or nucleons in nuclei , excited ( or ejected ) by this collapse , will radiate ( or move away ) .",
    "indeed , experimental limits on these ` spontaneous ' processes have strongly suggested the mass - density - dependent collapse incorporated in csl @xcite .",
    "the analysis accompanying these experiments was simplified by utilizing an expansion of the excitation rate in powers of the small parameter ( size of bound state/@xmath15 .    in the present paper",
    ", we shall apply csl in the opposite limit , to ultra - cold atomic gases bound in a magnetic and/or optical trap . in a sense , these systems are ` artificial atoms ' , where the electrons are replaced by atoms and the nuclear coulomb potential is replaced by a trap with ( size of bound state/@xmath16 . in this case , the csl localization effect excites the atoms in the trap .",
    "various techniques allow experimentalists to give the trapped atoms a temperature as low as a few nanokelvins @xcite .",
    "one might wonder , since these are the coldest samples studied by physicists , if experimental observations are compatible with the constant heating of the atoms by the csl process .",
    "the atoms in the trap can assume various forms . with bosonic samples , experimenters can obtain a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) with a negligible or substantial thermal cloud surrounding the condensate .",
    "experimenters can obtain a thermal cloud without a condensate ( in the case of a normal fermi gas , of course , the latter is the only possibility ) . when a trap is suddenly removed and , after a fixed time interval , the ensuing atomic density distribution is optically observed , the number of atoms in the condensate and cloud and the cloud s velocity distribution , and therefore temperature , may be determined .",
    "one may envisage experiments designed to detect csl effects .",
    "csl predicts the atoms will be heated , resulting in ejection of atoms from a bec into the cloud .",
    "if no other heating process takes place , this results in a bec lifetime which is inversely proportional to the csl collapse rate @xmath0 .",
    "of course , other well - known mechanisms heat or deplete a bose - einstein and its attendant cloud .",
    "collisions with unavoidable untrapped background gas within the apparatus can heat or eject atoms .",
    "background photons can produce a similar effect .",
    "there are 3-body collision processes which remove the involved atoms from the sample .",
    "atoms in the cloud with energy higher than the trap height can escape the trap .",
    "jitter in the position of the laser beams that form the trap conveys energy to the atoms , as do fluctuations in the laser intensity .",
    "we analyze the contribution of these effects , performing an energy audit on experimental data kindly supplied by hanns - christoph ngerl and manfred mark for a bec plus cloud composed of cesium atoms in an optical trap .",
    "this provides an upper limit on @xmath0 .",
    "the rest of this paper proceeds as follows .",
    "section ii provides a summary of csl and a derivation of the evolution equation of the density matrix for the atoms . using this , in section iii , the rate equation for the ensemble average of the number of atoms in each bound state",
    "is obtained .",
    "section iv explores consequences of the rate equation , applying these results to ideal situations .",
    "section v considers real situations .",
    "section vi applies the considerations of section v to particular experiments , thereby obtaining an upper limit on @xmath0 .",
    "we first briefly recall the essential features of csl theory , expressed in terms of the linear solution of the schrdinger equation , rather than the often - employed non - linear schrdinger stochastic differential equation@xcite .",
    "we shall describe the evolution of state vectors and then utilize that to obtain the evolution of the density matrix , enabling us to study ensemble averaged effects . from the density matrix evolution equation",
    "we obtain a rate equation for the state occupation number .",
    "we can then apply the results to the calculation of lifetimes of trapped atomic ultra - cold gases .      as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "two equations characterize csl .",
    "the first is a modified schrdinger equation : @xmath17 ) describes collapse toward the joint eigenstates of mutually commuting operators @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 is the time - ordering operator , which operates on all operators to its right .",

    "since eq.([1 ] ) does not describe a unitary evolution of the state vector , the norm of the state vector changes dynamically .",
