    "<S> @xcite : there is no finite ss region if one plots the phase diagram against @xmath13 ( an external field in the spin model ) . precisely at @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the coordination number , </S>",
    "<S> the sc , co and ss phases become all degenerate . </S>",
    "<S> while this may seem to indicate a ss region if one plots the phase diagram against @xmath34 @xcite , this occurs only at a single point on the @xmath13-axis , so that the ss is expected to be fragile against external perturbations and/or against phase separation to sc and co. at nonzero temperature , there is a finite hysteretic region where the solutions converge to either sc or co [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : strong_coupling](b ) ] with no intervening stable ss solutions . </S>",
    "<S> we thus conclude that , although the absence of ss is consistent with the qmc result in the strong coupling regime , the lowest - order @xmath75 model @xcite can not explain the ss phase in the holstein model without lattice frustration .    </S>",
    "<S> now we consider the effect of higher - order terms . generally , higher - order processes lead to longer - range exchange interactions as well as four- or more - spin interactions in the effective pseudospin model . </S>",
    "<S> while the details depend on the values of the parameters , it is known that longer - ranged exchange interactions can favor a ss @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the 4th - order expansion @xcite on the bethe lattice gives corrections of @xmath82 and @xmath83 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : xxz ] ) and , @xmath87 where @xmath88 denotes the next - nearest neighbor sites , and @xmath89 and @xmath90 are negative and positive , respectively [ inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : strong_coupling](c ) ] </S>",
    "<S> . intuitively , the @xmath91 term enables bipolarons to move around on the @xmath23 sublattice while avoiding those on the @xmath24 sublattice forming a co pattern , thus establishing a phase coherence within the less occupied sublattice in the co background [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : strong_coupling](d ) ] sublattice also has a sc component , and the mean - field analysis suggests that it is stabilized by the @xmath82 term , which favors phase coherence between the @xmath23 and @xmath24 sublattices . ] . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , within the mean - field theory it turns out that the effect of the @xmath90 term can be translated to that of a @xmath92 term with @xmath93 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence both terms cooperatively stabilize the ss phase in the intermediate - coupling regime , where longer - range terms from higher - order processes become significant . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : strong_coupling](c ) , the resultant mean - field phase diagram for the 4th - order effective pseudospin model indeed exhibits a ss region that widens toward the intermediate - coupling regime , although it overestimates the region .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusion _ we have investigated the ordered phases in the holstein model on a bipartite ( i.e. , nonfrustrated ) lattice away from half filling with dmft+ct - qmc calculation . </S>",
    "<S> we have focused on the unconventional region where @xmath61 and @xmath10 are comparable to the bandwidth @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> our study revealed that the intermediate coupling regime characterized by the peak of the @xmath0 dome and the metal - insulator crossover shows a supersolid phase and an associated qcp , while the observed absence of the ss in the weak- and strong - coupling regimes is consistent with perturbative analyses . </S>",
    "<S> the continuous phase transition between the sc and ss phases is hallmarked by a downward kink in the london penetration depth and a characteristic reentrance of the ss around the qcp . </S>",
    "<S> we have also discussed that the stable ss phase is originated from long - range processes of bipolarons . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that phenomena related to the ss phase and associated qcp may be explored in carbon - based compounds , some of which belong to the unconventional parameter regime considered here . further comparison with the related problem of af+sc should help to understand the competition and coexistence of dlro and odlro .    _ </S>",
