    "<S> we compute the cp - odd part of the finite temperature effective action for massive dirac fermions in the presence of a dirac monopole . we confirm that the induced charge is temperature dependent , and in the effective action we find an infinite series of cp - violating terms that generalize the familiar zero temperature @xmath0 term . </S>",

    "<S> the entire series is required at finite @xmath8 to show that @xmath9 is invariant under  large \" gauge transformations @xmath10 , @xmath11 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the higher terms are non - extensive ( i.e. they are not integrals of a lagrangian density ) , but they all vanish at zero temperature , leaving just the chern - simons term ( [ cs0 ] ) .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we investigate similar phenomena for the finite temperature induced charge and induced effective action in @xmath12 dimensional field theory . </S>",

    "<S> we recall that the quantum mechanics of a particle of electric charge @xmath13 and a magnetic pole of magnetic charge @xmath14 , is consistent only if these charges satisfy @xcite @xmath15 but the dirac hamiltonian @xmath16 for a fermion in the presence of a dirac monopole @xmath17 is not self - adjoint , and so requires the introduction of a self - adjoint extension parameter @xmath18 that characterizes the boundary conditions ( in the s - wave sector ) at the location of the monopole @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> in @xcite it was checked that the zero temperature limit ( i.e. @xmath23 ) of the expression ( [ coriano ] ) agrees with the zero temperature result ( [ witten ] ) [ see also ( [ q0 ] ) below ] .    </S>",
    "<S> these results should be compared with the related work of le guillou and schaposnik @xcite , who considered the problem of the electric charge of a non - abelian dyon at finite t with cp violation introduced by an explicit @xmath24 term , but no fermions . there , witten s relation ( 7 ) was found to be unchanged at finite t. however , as discussed in @xcite , the analysis of @xcite was effectively at tree level , and the inclusion of light fermions was shown @xcite ( in the limit of an infinitely massive t hooft - polyakov monopole ) to make the charge temperature dependent in a manner analogous to ( 9 ) .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we confirm the result ( [ coriano ] ) using a slightly different approach , and we then compute the corresponding cp - odd part of the finite temperature induced effective action for fermions in the background of a static dirac monopole . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to express everything in terms of the spectral function ( the density of states ) of the dirac equation for fermions in the background of a static dirac monopole . </S>",
    "<S> this spectral function is computed in the appendix using an elementary calculation of the resolvent of the ( s - wave ) dirac hamiltonian . </S>",

    "<S> the overall factor of @xmath43 arises as the degeneracy of the lowest partial wave ( _ viz _ , @xmath44 , with @xmath45 ) .    in the appendix , we present an elementary derivation of @xmath42 in terms of the diagonal resolvent ( i.e. diagonal green s function ) @xmath46 of @xmath37 [ see eqs . </S>",

    "<S> indeed , the integral expression ( [ qint ] ) is in fact the sommerfeld - watson representation of the sum in ( [ coriano ] ) ; and equivalently , the sum in ( [ coriano ] ) can be obtained from ( [ contour ] ) by deforming the contour around the poles of the @xmath66 function on the imaginary @xmath67 axis . </S>",

    "<S> first , since only the lowest partial wave sector of the spectrum has a cp - odd piece , we can ( just as we did for the charge ) use the reduced spectral function @xmath71 of the s - wave hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) , rather than the full spectral function @xmath26 of the dirac hamiltonian @xmath28 in ( [ dh ] ) . </S>",

    "<S> the higher order terms in the perturbative expansion ( [ cpodd ] ) of the cp - odd part of the induced effective action are not of this @xmath73 form . </S>",
    "<S> they are non - extensive in euclidean time , as they involve powers of @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , all these non - extensive terms vanish at zero temperature due to factors of @xmath75 , which vanishes exponentially fast as @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , at zero temperature only the first term survives , and the cp - odd part of the finite temperature induced effective action ( [ cpodd ] ) reduces to the familiar zero temperature expression ( [ mon0 ] ) .    </S>",
