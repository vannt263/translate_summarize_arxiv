    "in this paper we consider the problem of generating a high dimensional random variable according to a given probability distribution .",
    "we focus on the case where the random variable lies in a vector space and the probability distribution is absolutely continuous and has smooth density with respect to the lebesgue measure .",
    "the simplest and fully solved case is the when all entries are independent . in this case , it is enough to sample each entry independently at random .",
    "but if the entries fail to be independent , it becomes difficult to sample from the given distribution efficiently .",
    "let us give some examples where sampling is still possible .    1 .   in one dimension , it is possible to sample as soon as one is able to compute the cumulative function . 2 .   in dimension",
    "@xmath3 , let @xmath4 be a borel subset of @xmath5 , and @xmath6 be a measure on @xmath7 .",
    "if one wants to simulate the conditional probability @xmath8 , it is enough to sample according to @xmath9 and keep the simulated value if an only if the random sample belongs to @xmath4 .",
    "this technique is exact but it is efficiently implemented if and only if @xmath10 is large . in general , we are interested in a sequence of probability spaces indexed by @xmath3 with @xmath11 . in this setup , replacing @xmath4 by @xmath12 , @xmath13 decays quickly to zero and this technique can not be applied .",
    "3 .   in higher dimension",
    "too , there exists tricks to simulate interesting singular measures , such as for example the uniform measure on the unit sphere . in this case",
    ", it is enough to sample according to @xmath14 and divide by the @xmath15 .",
    "although some interesting things can be said in a more general context of measures on manifolds , we do not discuss this problem here and plan to address it elsewhere .",
    "let us note also that the second item above can be generalized to the more general setup of a probability measure on @xmath5 that is not uniform , but rather absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure , and has a continuous density supported on a compact set . denoting this density by @xmath16 and its support by @xmath17 , due to the fubini theorem it is enough to simulate the uniform measure on the compact set @xmath18 and take the first component . in principle",
    "this can be achieved through the conditional probability methods .",
    "this technique is sometimes known as the rejection method .",
    "this is going to be the framework in which we are interested .",
    "note however , that the measure of the set on which the necessary conditions are fullfiled can be too small to have any practical use in a large dimension .",
    "therefore , instead of trying to achieve an explicit sampling , we analyze in this paper a scheme of an approximate sampling , that is close to the targeted sampling in _ total variation norm_. some techniques using sdes to achieve this have been developed but they are less systematic . here",
    "we will focus on techniques based on markov chains .",
    "our approach may be considered as a variant of the slice sampling  see also @xcite .",
    "in particular , our assumptions will be good enough to deal with the case of the uniform measure on convex bodies .",
    "this will lead us to a subsequent part of our paper where we deal with important applications of our results to quantum information theory .",
    "there , we give theoretical convergence rates and also concrete simulations .",
    "one important technical assumption that we will need to make is that the density of the measure to be simulated can be ` easily ' computed at a given point .",
    "for example , if we are interested in the uniform measure on the convex body of separable states , the problem of finding out whether a state is separable or not is a ` hard ' problem @xcite , and in particular it is ` hard ' to tell whether the density is zero or not .",
    "one important feature of our algorithm is that we do nt need to know the measure itself , but only a multiple of it .",
    "this is important because sometimes it is very difficult to compute partition functions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ section : problem ] we formulate the problem and introduce necessary tools . in sections [ section : conv_rates ] and [ section : conv_rates_random ] we prove the convergence theorems for two types of sampling and provide general estimates for the convergence rates .",
    "these estimates are worked out in section [ section : application ] first for standard geometric objects , and it is shown that the convergence is faster for @xmath0-simplices than for @xmath0cubes and @xmath0balls . later",
    "similar estimations are obtained for convex sets used in physical applications , including the birkhoff polytope of bistochastic matrices , the set of quantum states and its subset consisting ppt states with positive partial transpose .",
    "the paper is concluded with some remarks in section [ section : remarks ] .",

    ", one considers often various convex subsets of the above sets , and is interested to analyze properties of their typical elements . to this end",

    "exist such algorithms dedicated to a given set : for instance , procedures to generate random quantum states were studied in @xcite , while other contributions deal with random subnormalized states @xcite , random bistochastic matrices @xcite and random quantum operations @xcite .    however , the procedures mentioned above are dedicated to a particular problem and can not be easily adopted to other convex sets . on the other hand ,",

    "any initial probability measure @xmath6 transformed by the corresponding markov operator converges exponentially to the invariant measure @xmath281 , uniform in @xmath1 .",
    "explicit estimations for the convergence rate are derived in terms of the ratio @xmath190 between the radii of the sphere inscribed inside @xmath1 and the sphere outscribed on it and the number @xmath90 determining the @xmath90accessibility of the body with respect to a given orthogonal basis @xmath92 in @xmath62 .    thus the algorithm presented here can be used in practice to generate , for instance , a sample of random quantum states .",
    "we reviewed in detail the case of a a composed quantum system , and of a sampling according to the uniform masure on the set of states with positive partial transpose .",
    "but our algorithm applies potentially to many other interesting collection of objects in quantum information theory , such as , for example , stochastic maps and bistochastic maps , trace non  increasing maps , etc .",
    "sampling random states satisfying a given condition and analyzing their statistical properties is relevant in the research on quantum entanglement and correlations in multi - partite quantum systems .",
    "a standard approach of generating random points from the entire set of quantum states with respect to the flat measure @xcite and checking a posteriori , whether the partial transpose of the state constructed is positive , becomes inefficient for large dimensions , as the relative volume of the set of ppt states becomes exponentially small @xcite .",

    "running the algorithm for the triangle @xmath282 with the basis @xmath156 ( see fig . [",

    "although this set has the full measure of the triangle it is an open set , so the convergence will not be exponential .",
    "in general , for any @xmath90accessible set , the lower parameter @xmath90 characterizing the accessibility is , the faster convergence of the markov chain to the unique invariant measure @xmath281 one obtains .",
