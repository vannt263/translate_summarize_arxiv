    "dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies were immediately recognized as mysterious stellar systems upon shapley s discovery of the first example of this galaxy class , `` a stellar system of a new type '' , in the constellation sculptor @xcite . as @xcite pointed out after his discovery of a second example in the fornax constellation soon afterward , the dsph galaxies `` have some properties in common with globular clusters , others with spheroidal galaxies , and still others ( nearness and complete resolution into stars ) with the magellanic clouds . ''",
    "the uniqueness of these systems was further born out by thackeray s study of sculptor s variable star population , which indicated a `` physical dissimilarity '' between this new stellar system and a globular cluster @xcite .",
    "however , to shapley the density profile was the most remarkable aspect of these diffuse , low - surface - brightness `` clusters '' ; indeed , he points out that had not the discovery plate been abnormally sensitive and taken during sky conditions that were also above average , `` the sculptor cluster would not have been found . ''",
    "it is fair to say that the density distribution ( stellar number and mass density ) of dsph galaxies remains one of the most perplexing aspects of these systems . when the radial light profiles are converted to a stellar mass density and compared to that suggested by the internal dynamics of stars in these systems , very large dark matter contents are inferred ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see @xcite for a summary ) . from these measurements ,",
    "the very low mass dsph galaxies make up the high end of the current mass - to - light ( @xmath13 ) scale for distinct stellar systems , with members having total @xmath13 s approaching 100 ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or even exceeding that value by almost an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "even on the low end of this scale , with an apparent total @xmath14 @xcite , the sculptor dsph is extraordinarily dominated by dark matter for such a low - mass stellar system ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the physical extents of dsph galaxies also remain uncertain , but have become a fulcrum on which recent debate regarding the true dark matter content of dsph s lie .",
    "the question is not only whether all of the light has been fully accounted for ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but whether the increasingly large extensions of the radial profiles found by various observers on well - studied dsph examples are clues to something untoward in our basic understanding of the true dark matter content / distribution within , and the dynamical state of , these systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the situation for the sculptor dsph is more or less representative of the history of attempting to understand the dsph galaxy class as a whole . on shallow images including only the top two magnitudes of its luminosity function",
    ", @xcite originally showed the radius of the sculptor system to be at least @xmath16 , but with evidence for stars extending to as much as a degree from the center . extending shapley s starcount work , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter @xcite ) conducted a 2.2 deg@xmath0 survey using more plates of slightly shallower depth .",
    "he determined a limiting radius of @xmath17 for sculptor , which was close to shapley s lower limit .",
    "more importantly , @xcite found a `` definite limiting radius '' where the density of stars in sculptor apparently reaches zero . under the assumption of @xmath18 , this radius was consistent with expectations for a system that is tidally limited by the milky way ( mw ) .",
    "unfortunately , density profiles that drop sharply to zero density can be artificially created by overestimates of a subtracted background level , and it would seem that hodge s survey area was too limited to contain true `` background '' regions free of sculptor stars ( as we show later in this paper ) .",
    "subsequent studies of the distribution of sculptor s substantial rr lyrae population found it to be much more extended than the quoted @xcite tidal limit of the galaxy : @xcite states , `` variable stars have been traced in the sculptor system out to distances of well over @xmath19 . '' later @xcite fit a @xcite model to the distribution of rr lyrae stars and found a king limiting radius ( @xmath11 ) of @xmath20 , in good agreement with the @xcite measurement .",
    "however , @xcite also found that likely 10% of sculptor rr lyraes are located _ outside _ this limiting radius ( which they interpret as a tidal radius ) and that they extend to @xmath21 from the center of the galaxy .",
    "the dynamical nature of individual stars ( such as the above variable stars ) or statistical stellar overdensities beyond the `` limiting radii '' of dsphs is quite contentious , but as a group these stars are often termed `` extratidal '' , as was done by @xcite .",
    "while this is an often - adopted shorthand , note that ( 1 ) king models may not necessarily apply to dsph galaxies , which have longer relaxation timescales than the globular clusters for which the models were intended , and , therefore , ( 2 ) some models of dwarf spheroidal structure may include _ bound _",
    "`` extratidal '' populations beyond a king profile . to allay confusion between the observed spatial position and the actual dynamical state of stars found beyond the king limiting radius , we limit use of the expression `` extratidal '' here , preferring instead the term `` break population '' , which refers to a change in the slope of the radial density law that these stars create .    the results from @xcite led others to reevaluate the spatial distribution of the sculptor dsph .",
    "@xcite obtained photographic data @xmath22 magnitudes deeper than that presented by @xcite and found a limiting radius between @xmath23 and @xmath24 ; however , @xcite note that this value is highly dependent on the adopted background .",
    "they could obtain the @xcite limiting radius after subtracting an excessively large background level ( an effect no doubt confounding the original @xcite study ) ; but , they could also obtain a limiting radius that was `` essentially infinite '' by adopting their lowest background estimate . in a study that included multiple uk schmidt plates that reached much greater angular distances from the center of sculptor and @xmath25 magnitudes deeper than the @xcite data , @xcite noted a similar sensitivity of his results to the adopted background level . in order to force the king model to fit all points to the extent of his survey",
    ", the adopted background had to be 3@xmath26 higher than the calculated background , which forced _ all _ points with @xmath27 below the background level .",
    "this study ultimately identified a best - fit king model with @xmath28 but noted the inability of this fitted profile to fully describe the radial distribution of sculptor .",
    "* hereafter @xcite ) used one uk schmidt plate of similar depth to those of @xcite and found @xmath29 .",
    "ccd data going approximately one magnitude deeper but over slightly less than half the area of @xcite was recently used by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter @xcite ) who determined , however , @xmath30 using the theoretical @xcite profile .    in three of the four most recent studies , not only has the derived king profile limiting radius grown , but the density of the presumed sculptor stars near and beyond this radius has been found to be significantly ( @xmath31 ) in excess of densities predicted by the king model .",
    "in fact , the starcounts from @xcite show the overdense , `` extratidal '' population represents roughly 13% of the whole of sculptor , in agreement with measurements from the rr lyrae distribution @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite have claimed not only the existence of a break population but also a hint of extratidal arms extending from sculptor to the northwest and southeast .",
    "we address this and other previous results in comparison with our own in more detail in  5 and  6 .",
    "an overdensity at large radii is not exclusive to the sculptor dsph . in their study , which included eight of the now ten known local dsphs , @xcite comment , `` there is a noticeable tendency for most of the dsphs to show an excess of stars , with respect to the best - fitting king model , at large radii . ''",
    "@xcite state that this excess density is not likely caused by incorrect background determinations . as previously discovered by @xcite and @xcite , @xcite find an unreasonably large background estimate would have to be adopted to eliminate the excess density _ in the case of every dsph_. subsequently , break populations were reported in other studies for carina @xcite , ursa minor @xcite , leo i @xcite , draco @xcite , and possibly sextans @xcite .",
    "of course , the sagittarius dsph ( sgr ) @xcite is the clearest indicator that at least one satellite galaxy of the mw is experiencing tidally - induced mass loss , which contributes a break population to its radial profile .",
    "this dsph has now been shown to have extratidal debris wrapping more than @xmath32 around the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    unfortunately , the existence or cause of the break populations in other dsphs are not as clear as in the sgr system .",
    "for example , whether a break population exists around the draco dsph has been controversial and highlights the importance of careful studies in the low - density regimes of the radial density profile . @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite all report evidence for stars beyond the nominal draco limiting radius .",
    "however , using sloan digital sky survey data , @xcite find no tidal extensions and no evidence of a break in the radial density profile , a result also found by @xcite ( who apparently reverse the previous conclusions of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in addition , both @xcite and @xcite find that the radial distribution of draco is better fit by an exponential profile with no real limiting radius as prescribed by the @xcite profile , whereas a change in the slope ( from a ",
    "break population \" ) of the draco density profile is obvious in the data shown by @xcite .",
    "similar controversy has been raised in the case of the carina dsph , for which @xcite , @xcite and @xcite all claim a break population but for which @xcite find no break population and @xcite question the @xcite result .",
    "a thorough reanalysis of the debate surrounding the existence of a break population in carina is given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter @xcite ) and further proof that a carina break population exists is given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter @xcite ) .",
    "these case histories suggest that the state of the dsph observational record remains unsettled ( or , at least , not universally accepted ) , and this empirical ambiguity forestalls any meaningful ( or , at least , complete ) interpretation of the physical state of these systems . as discussed above , the observational difficulty lies in a proper accounting for the low - density dsph regions against the usually overwhelming contamination by foreground field stars and background galaxies . as we have seen , the physical extent of the sculptor dsph has apparently grown with deeper and/or more accurate studies conducted over larger areas .",
    "to improve the contrast of the true dsph members over the contaminating background ( hereafter the `` signal - to - background '' ratio or @xmath33 ) , survey approaches have progressed from the early simple star count analyses to searches in selectively tuned subregions of color - magnitude space ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for the dsphs , such studies rely on deep photometry reaching to dsph - rich parts of the cmd , such as the main sequence turn - off ( msto ) , to boost the contributed dsph signal .",
    "however , to employ such a technique in the case of an expansive and distant system like sculptor , which in some previous estimates has an @xmath11 as large as @xmath34 and which has a msto near @xmath35 , one anticipates needing a substantial amount of imaging ( say @xmath36 deg@xmath0 ) on 4-m class telescopes or larger to confidently reach at least twice the king limiting radius in all directions . even attempting such an experiment on only a fraction of this area with the currently largest mosaic ccd cameras",
    "is a daunting prospect .    in this series of papers",
    "we have taken an alternative approach to high @xmath33 mapping of low - density , extended regions of galactic satellites by concentrating instead on _ reducing the background _ in the problem .",
    "our technique employs more easily obtainable , _ relatively shallow _ imaging in the washington @xmath37 filter system to isolate ( typically low - metallicity ) giant stars associated with the dsph from the primary field contaminant , foreground dwarf stars from the more metal - rich disk .",
    "this methodology goes a long way toward the limit of zero background , so that we are left with relatively pure samples of _ bona fide _ dsph - associated giant stars .",
    "a benefit of this approach is that we identify the very stars needed for practical follow - up , spectroscopic analysis .",
    "so far in this series we have presented the methodology ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter @xcite ) and applied it to determine the distributions of giant stars in the carina , ursa minor , draco and leo i dsphs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this technique has also been used to study the m31 dsph galaxies and i , and ii and and iii @xcite .",
    "a preliminary report on our survey of sculptor has been given in @xcite .",
    "we have given a report of preliminary results on these and other dsphs we are currently investigating , including sculptor , in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "since those summary reports and @xcite , we have extended the radial coverage of our washington@xmath38 survey around sculptor , improved the critical assessment of the residual background noise , and included a parallel analysis using sculptor s horizontal branch stars .",
    "we report here evidence for an extended , king profile break population of stars around the sculptor dsph out to at least two limiting radii .",
    "these results are found with independent analyses of both blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) and red giant branch ( rgb ) star tracers .",
    "these photometric mappings are backed up with spectroscopic verification of radial velocity membership for a small subsample of selected sculptor star candidates (  4 ) .",
    "our findings here strengthen the claim that at least some galactic dsphs may be experiencing non - negligible stellar mass loss , most likely tidally induced .",
    "thus , they provide important constraints applicable to the ultimate goals of our overall , long - term project , which are to ( 1 ) understand satellite disruption within the context of the hierarchical build - up of the galactic halo as predicted by cold dark matter models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xmath53 ) would be very ambitious when one is limited to 0.1  0.16 deg@xmath0 per pointing . therefore , to explore the nature of the sculptor radial profile to large radii , our survey strategy focused on covering an area of approximately 1.28 deg@xmath0 at the dsph center , but with the majority of attention extended to @xmath54 toward the east and south .",
    "even this `` lop - sided '' coverage over 7.82 deg@xmath0 required nearly 100 separate pointings  59 from the site # 1 chip and 37 from the site # 3 chip  and nearly 400 individual ccd frames .",

    "all observed pointings were locked onto a single magnitude system in the following way . for photometric frames , the measured magnitude of each individual star",

    "stars observed in multiple photometric frames were used to determine residual relative magnitude zero - point offsets between these frames .",

    "second , those stars selected as giant stars must have combinations of effective temperatures and apparent magnitudes consistent with the rgb and/or red horizontal branch ( rhb ) of sculptor in the ( @xmath72 , @xmath41 ) color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",

    "the @xcite data ( 1 ) show a separation of the rhb and the rgb that is actually more pronounced in ( @xmath91 , @xmath90 ) space than in ( @xmath92 ) space , and ( 2 ) extend to magnitudes required to define rgb bounding limits suitable for our deepest @xmath41 , @xmath42 data ( see figure 1 of * ? ? ?",

    "rather , we are only attempting to include as many probable sculptor stars _ from our giant candidate sample _ as possible , after delineating that population by appealing to a data set where the rhb is more distinct from the rgb .",
    "the extreme blue colors of bhb stars relative to the msto of the mw field population provides a unique opportunity to isolate a fairly pure sample of sculptor bhb candidates using only a cmd selection .",
    "however , as seen by comparing the bhb in figures [ fig : cmd1]a and [ fig : cmd1]b , imposition of the previously adopted magnitude error limits substantially reduces the number of selected stars from the very blue end of the bhb , primarily due to limitations of the @xmath42 photometry .",
    "however , because the bhb is _ so _ blue , for this cmd selection we can tolerate larger ( @xmath99 ) color errors ( along the bhb ) with little decrease in sample purity ( see table [ tab : meanerr ] for the mean color error of this sample ) .",

    "the sculptor bhb candidate selection procedure is demonstrated in figure [ fig : hb ] .    as with the rgb / rhb selection ,",
    "we again limit the stars used for definition of the bounding limits to those having sculptor proper motion membership probabilities greater than 80% ( figure [ fig : hb]a ) . in the definition of the bhb selection ,",
    "the three main considerations are : ( 1 ) enclosure of the available blue extent of the bhb stars , ( 2 ) inclusion of rr lyrae stars ( which , due to variability , will have a larger magnitude scatter than non - variable hb stars ) , and ( 3 ) minimization of error - scattered contaminants from the `` blue edge '' of the mw field dwarf population .",
    "the final selection criteria are applied to the entire survey as demonstrated in figure [ fig : hb]b . for stars with @xmath100 , the approximate blue edge of the mw field population , error bars in both color and magnitude",

    "color and magnitude error bars are included on individual candidate points in figure [ fig : findb]a to give a sense of the security of the sample definitions with respect to their photometric errors .",
    "we also include average color and magnitude errors in 0.25 magnitude bins for the selected sculptor candidate sample and for the de - selected , `` field star '' sample .",
    "these average errors demonstrate that the quality of data between the field and candidate lists are comparable , but , in detail , the data outside the core of the galaxy are demonstrably of greater average quality than data taken near the sculptor core . from figure [",

    "sculptor stars may be omitted by the joint 2cd and cmd selection criteria due to : ( 1 ) the decreasing sensitivity of the 2cd to the giant / dwarf discrimination on the lower rgb and sub - giant branch , ( 2 ) rhb stars that fall outside the 2cd and/or cmd selections , ( 3 ) asymptotic giant branch or rgb stars that fall outside the rgb / rhb selection at bright magnitudes , ( 4 ) rr lyrae stars in variability phases that place them outside our `` bhb '' selection , and ( 5 ) stars with photometric errors that scatter the data points beyond our selection limits .",

    "this correlation of derived dispersions with radial coverage points to the likely existence of a _ radial gradient _ in sculptor velocity dispersion , with a hotter dispersion found at larger radius .",

    "clearly one would prefer better statistics at larger radii , but we note that a radial gradient is implied by the results of @xcite , who note that hotter dispersions attach to the more metal - poor sculptor stars and that these stars have a larger radial extent than metal - rich sculptor stars . our own analysis of sculptor shows a similarly distinct radial distribution of `` metal - poor '' and `` metal - rich '' populations ( see discussion in  5.4 ) .",
    "it seems difficult to escape the conclusion that the sculptor dispersion profile is , at minimum , flat to a significant fraction of the king limiting radius , and could even be rising at large radius ( at least there seems to be a rise in the dispersion past @xmath6 ) .",
    "this is a trend that is being found in other dsph systems ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "predominantly bound stellar systems are generally expected to produce _ declining _ dispersion profiles because the keplerian orbits of stars within the system should produce lower velocities at their apocenters .",

    "a flat / rising dispersion trend is also found in ursa minor to large radius ( see paper ix ) .",
    "ironically , after measuring a similarly flat profile in the draco system , @xcite have appealed to an enormous dark matter halo , @xmath177 , as an alternative means to keep the dispersion hot to large radius . on the other hand , @xcite",

    "it is reasonable to expect similar models will work for sculptor , which is at a similar galactocentric radius and orbital phase as carina .",
    "it is certainly compelling that the sgr system also shows a flat / rising @xmath129 trend @xcite .",
    "the structural and _ dynamical _ similarity of sgr to other dsphs strongly begs the question of whether the disrupting sgr is more dsph _ paradigm _ than exception @xcite .",
    "it is also worth noting that while the velocity distribution of stars in the inner parts of sculptor is gaussian , the distribution in the outer parts becomes fairly platykurtic  a distribution unexpected for a fully bound population of stars .",
    "these issues are explored further in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this subsection is to demonstrate the apparent flat dispersion profile in sculptor and point out the consistency of this trend with the interpretation that the sculptor radial density break population we measure below (  5 ) may constitute unbound , tidal debris .      a primary motivation for the rvs in the present study ( including those with the lower velocity precision from observations in 2000 ) was to evaluate whether our photometric techniques to select sculptor candidates are accurate so that we have confidence in the reliability of sculptor structural properties derived from such data .",

    "the different symbols defined in the legend of figure [ fig : rvdist]a reflect the various categories in column 10 of table [ tab : rvfull ] , where we correlate our photometric (  3 ) and rv (  4.3 ) membership criteria .",
    "figure [ fig : rvselect ] displays the sculptor field 2cd and cmd to illustrate the selection / de - selection of stars having derived rvs ( where symbols are the same as in figure [ fig : rvdist ] ) . figure [ fig : rvselect ] illustrates the efficacy of our photometric selection technique at isolating individual , highly probable sculptor members ; creating such reliable target lists is particularly helpful for ensuring cost - effective spectroscopic observations of the low - density regions of the dsph , where contamination by mw field stars becomes a more significant problem ( see figure [ fig : bgdemon ] and  5.2.4 ) .",
    "table [ tab : pvcomp ] summarizes the accuracy of the photometric selection criteria for the subsample of spectra obtained to date .",
    "given that most of the spectra obtained to date are for @xmath178 candidates , the statistics are properly interpreted to represent our success for stars to these magnitudes , but do lend confidence that we can expect improved selection efficiency at fainter magnitudes over selection methodologies based on only cmd - position of candidates .",
    "the values given in the final column are the percentage of photometric selections that agree with the spectroscopic selection out of the total number of spectroscopically observed stars . among all stars ( bhb or rgb ) we have selected to be photometric members that have rvs , a combined 94% are found to be spectroscopic members ( i.e. , only 6% are found to be false positives ) .",
    "figure [ fig : rvdist ] shows evidence for a decrease in our false positive rate with radius from the center ( i.e. , with lower dsph density ) ; beyond in 0.5@xmath11 , 71% of our photometric members are confirmed spectroscopic members .",
    "this success rate can be compared to the 77% ( 308/401 ) velocity member success rate @xcite found over their entire survey ( which probes to similar magnitudes ) , a rate that declines to @xmath179 for their stars observed beyond 0.5@xmath11 .",
    "based on these trends , we predict that further study at even lower density regions of the dsph will show an even wider disparity in success rates between cmd - only and @xmath180cmd methods for picking candidate sculptor stars .    among our 22 photometrically - selected , _",
    "non_-members having derived rvs , nine have rvs consistent with sculptor membership .",
    "that our photometric selection is missing some sculptor members is consistent with our overall philosophy of sacrificing completeness for the sake of sample reliability . for purposes of mapping dsph structure ,",
    "incompleteness removes signal whereas unreliable candidates add background .",
    "our strategy is to aim for near - zero background to make sure diffuse components are mapped reliably , and this has driven adoption of rather conservative selection criteria .",
    "for example , four of the nine `` false negatives '' in table [ tab : pvcomp ] actually satisfy _ both _ the 2cd and cmd selection criteria in figure [ fig : rvselect ] ; these sculptor giants were lost from our sample _ because they failed our point source image shape criteria_. thus , these four stars ( marked with footnote `` f '' in table [ tab : rvfull ] ) are technically not failures of the washington+@xmath181 giant selection method _ per se _ ; nevertheless , we conservatively treat them as `` selection failures '' in our accounting . with the presently small spectroscopic sample of non - selected stars",
    "it is difficult to estimate our true sample incompleteness , especially given that it varies across the color - color - magnitude volume as a function of mainly stellar temperature and photometric error .",
    "figure [ fig : rvselect ] in fact shows that the other five false negatives tend to lie just outside one of our selection limits , as might be expected .",
    "the resulting high degree of reliability of our photometric methodology is not unique to this study of sculptor but is also true for our similar studies of ursa minor , draco , leo i , andromeda i and andromeda iii ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; * ? ? ?",
    "our spectroscopic results show that our photometric samples are of a high degree of reliability , and that our method confers a higher success rate for identifying _ bona fide _ sculptor stars than simple cmd - based selections ( e.g. , compare figure 11a to figure 4 of @xcite ; see also papers vi and ix ) . however , it is worthwhile to investigate the origin of the remaining few sample interlopers found among the spectroscopic sample of sculptor giant candidates .",
    "first , our derived magnitudes are not perfect , so that there is some photometric scatter across our selection boundaries .",
    "inspection of figure [ fig : rvselect ] shows that a number of our false positives and false negatives are near the borders of our selection regions .",
    "the color and magnitude error bars in figure [ fig : rvselect ] demonstrate that some of the false classifications can be explained by photometric errors .",
    "table [ tab : meanerr ] gives the mean color and magnitude errors for the various samples used here for the analysis of the structure of sculptor .",
    "the tabulated means show where potential vulnerabilities to photometric contamination are highest ( e.g. , on the lower rgb ) .",
    "there are also some objects that lie more squarely within our selection limits that are not kinematically associated with sculptor .",
    "these objects likely fall in one of the following categories : point - like galaxies ( which are dominated by the light from giant stars or may have their magnesium features redshifted out of the @xmath43 band ) , metal - poor field subdwarfs ( which also have suppressed magnesium lines ) , or mw field giant stars .",
    "our means of selecting against galaxies relies on morphological parameters output by psf - fitting , but point - like galaxies like quasars and agn may pass these criteria unabated .",
    "in fact , among our sample of rgb / rhb candidates we spectroscopically observed one quasar at ( @xmath168,@xmath169 ) = ( @xmath182 ) . but",
    "any galaxies in the sample would likely be revealed by extreme , non - milky way - like rvs .    according to the isometallicity lines given in figure [ fig:2color ] , metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath183 ) sub - dwarfs",
    "may also pass our 2cd selection .",
    "following arguments given in @xcite , we should find @xmath184 such subdwarfs in our _ entire _ survey area ( i.e. , at a density of @xmath185arcmin@xmath186 ) , and we certainly have fewer than this limit .",
    "our selection criteria allow for selection of field giant stars that happen to have colors and magnitudes similar to the sculptor rgb / rhb .",
    "again , the contaminant surface density here is small given estimates from our control fields (  5.1 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that milky way stars orbiting _ prograde _ about the milky way will , in general , have @xmath187 km s@xmath149 in this direction of the sky ( @xmath188 \\sim [ 288 , -83]^{\\circ}$ ] ) .",
    "this can be seen , e.g. , by the distribution of velocities for non - sculptor stars in figure 4 of @xcite , which has a concentration of stars with these velocities . only dynamically hot stars  stars with either retrograde orbits or with significant motions in the negative galactic @xmath189 direction",
    " will be expected to have higher @xmath190 .",
    "several of our false positives are in this category .",
    "in addition , we find that for those false positives having mike echelle spectroscopy , the equivalent widths of the calcium infrared triplet lines are generally comparable to those of both sculptor and carina dsph members observed on the same run but less than other , more metal - rich stars also observed in the carina field ( more details are presented in @xcite ) .",
    "these velocity and chemical traits suggest that some halo stars are contributing to the false positives .",
    "still yet another explanation for at least some of the false positives is that they are actually sculptor stars .",
    "we have already noted (  4.4 ) that the velocity dispersion of the dsph appears to be growing with radius , yet we used the _ same _",
    "@xmath129 rejection at all radii to exclude likely non - members .",
    "however , of the nine false positives in our spectroscopic sample we note that three lie within 15 km s@xmath149 of our sculptor velocity membership limits , six lie within 32 km s@xmath149 and all but one of these are beyond 50 arcmin from the sculptor center . at these velocities and considering their @xmath191 these six  false positives \" must either be halo stars that are highly retrograde and/or that have a large galactic @xmath192 motion perpendicular to the disk ; yet there are not comparable numbers of false positive stars with the _ opposite _ properties , as might be expected for a randomly populated , hot halo .",
    "it seems conceivable that at least some of these stars might be _ bona fide _ sculptor giants , consistent with the notion that the velocity dispersion is growing with radius .",
    "no matter their origin , in the end , all of these contamination effects will be accounted for as ( a small ) `` background '' in our analysis of the sculptor radial density fits (  5.2 ) , and we expect our high @xmath33 sculptor giant candidate lists to provide a reliable means by which to map the structural properties of the sculptor dsph . while we do not have a similar spectroscopic testing of the bhb samples , we shall show (  5.3 ) that these stars yield very similar sculptor morphological properties to the rgb samples .",
    "a proper assessment of the background is critical to proper determination of the density distribution of the low density dsph galaxies .",
    "this rings particularly true for the sculptor dsph given the reviewed (  1 ) history of attempts to determine its physical extent .",
    "our goal here has been to attack the problem anew with a methodology aimed at substantially _ reducing _ the background level so that fractional errors in its estimation have significantly less effect on our morphological parameterization of the system , particularly in its tenuous outer parts .",
    "we will make a quantitative assessment of the resultant @xmath33 improvement below (  5.2.4 ) , but a qualitative impression of our success is given by the cmd of _ non-_selected stars shown in figure [ fig : findb]c , which demonstrates the amount of ( mostly ) foreground material along the carina rgb that has been removed from consideration , while the spectroscopic assessment of our contamination level ( table [ tab : pvcomp ] ) shows that our residual contamination rate is very low to at least @xmath7 ( @xmath193 ;  4.5 ) , and likely very good to even fainter magnitudes . nevertheless , our contamination rate is not zero , and we now attempt to clarify how much residual `` background '' level remains so that we can establish the radial profile of sculptor to the lowest possible densities .    in our previous papers ( e.g. , @xcite ) ,",
    "estimation of the background to our rgb samples has been based on the assumption that , to first order , the densities of mw halo giants and hb stars roughly follow @xmath194 laws , so that their contribution along a line of sight is roughly flat in magnitude . under these circumstances , were one to shift the rgb / rhb and bhb cmd selection criteria in magnitude ( in the case of the rgb / rhb samples , this is done through the cmd of stars already selected to be giant candidates in the 2cd ) , the background contribution of these field stars should be approximately constant . for other classes of background contaminant ( e.g. , metal - poor disk disk subdwarfs with an exponential density law , halo dwarfs which are close enough that heliocentric distance is not a reasonable proxy for @xmath194 , and other disk stars with large photometric errors )",
    "the @xmath194 assumption will be less correct , but the above method provides a reasonable first order estimate of the background level .",
    "assumption for halo msto dwarfs . ]",
    "table [ tab : cmdbg ] gives the results of shifting our adopted cmd selection regions in magnitude .",
    "the brightest magnitude offset ( i.e. largest negative @xmath195 listed ) is set by the saturation limit of the ccd frames ; shifting the region to fainter magnitudes is precluded because of problems with survey incompleteness in this direction .",
    "when determining a background estimate with this method , one must `` clear '' those small @xmath195 offsets where sculptor stars themselves contribute ; for each sample in table [ tab : cmdbg ] the cmd offsets where background stars dominate are those below the horizontal line . taking the average counts below these lines and dividing by the total area covered by each sample yields the estimated background number density , @xmath196 , given in the final line of table [ tab : cmdbg ] along with its poissonian error .    a second method by which we can estimate the background is by determining the number of `` sculptor giants '' selected by our 2cd and cmd criteria but at large distances from the sculptor core .",
    "unfortunately , our sculptor radial surface density plots never converged to a constant background level even as we continued to add spatial coverage at ever larger radii . to remedy this problem we observed four background `` control '' fields",
    "significantly separated ( by @xmath55 ) from the center of the dsph in each of the cardinal directions ( figure [ fig : uncutfield]a ) . at such remote locations with respect to sculptor ( with @xmath11 estimated at @xmath197 by @xcite ) it is less likely that we will see a significant contribution from sculptor stars .",
    "these four fields were taken during the 23 october 2001 observing run ( see table [ tab : obs ] ) and are of similar quality to our normal survey fields , though their magnitude limits vary .",
    "table [ tab : fieldbg ] gives the background densities in our complete list of giants ( just the 2cd selection ) and in each of our magnitude limited samples for each 353.85 arcmin@xmath0 control field ; no data are given when the fields were insufficiently deep for proper comparison with a particular , magnitude - limited sample .",
    "confidence limits for a poissonian probability distribution are given at the 90% and 68% levels .",
    "unfortunately , three of the four control fields were insufficiently deep in @xmath42 to characterize accurately the background number density of our bhb samples",
    ". the final column gives the average control field background level , @xmath198 .",
    "table [ tab : fieldbg ] illustrates several things .",
    "first , the background densities derived by this independent method are also extremely low ; only 0 , 1 , or 2 stars were found for any sample in any field .",
    "this reflects both the efficacy of the washington@xmath38 technique to throw out foreground dwarfs as well as the high , @xmath199 latitude of the sculptor system , which limits the number of mw contaminants overall .",
    "the 2cd giant selection throws out 95 - 98% of the total stars in the control fields and 98 - 100% of the total is thrown out when both the 2cd and cmd selections are imposed .",
    "second , the background densities estimated from the control fields are similar to those found with the `` cmd offset '' method .",
    "although the background densities derived with the latter method are slightly smaller than those determined by the control fields , they are well within the confidence limits ( though we acknowledge that the confidence limits on the control field densities are large relative to the actual values because of the small number statistics from which they are derived ) . finally , the background estimates obtained with either the method illustrated in table [ tab : cmdbg ] or that in table [ tab : fieldbg ] are consistent ( within poissonian errors ) with the spectroscopic determination of a small ( @xmath2005% )  false positive \" rate in our rgb samples to either @xmath201 or @xmath202 ( table [ tab : pvcomp ] ;  4.5 ) .",
    "we fit our sculptor density distribution with both a single component king model and with a power - law with a flat core ( plc ) model , the two functions used by @xcite in their study of the ursa minor dsph .",
    "the fitted king functions define the stellar surface density , @xmath203 , as @xmath204^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right\\}^{2 } + \\sigma_{b } & , ~{\\rm if }   ~q^{2 } \\le \\frac{r_{\\rm lim}^{2}}{a^{2}(1-\\varepsilon ) } \\\\",

    "the plc model is given by @xmath215 where @xmath41 is the total number of stars , @xmath216 is the power - law fall off , and the other parameters carry the same definition as in the king model .",
    "best - fitting parameters were calculated using bayesian and maximum likelihood techniques while errors are estimated using a bayesian approach in conjunction with a markov chain technique .",
    "the fitting algorithms are explained in greater detail by @xcite and @xcite .      the best - fitting king profile parameters to our different magnitude - limited samples",
    "are given in table [ tab : rpkingfits ] along with previous literature values for comparison .",
    "the best - fitting plc profile parameters are given in table [ tab : rpplcfits ] .",
    "tables [ tab : rpkingfits ] and [ tab : rpplcfits ] also give the error - weighted means of the model parameters derived from the four different stellar samples analyzed .",
    "note that the error on the quoted mean values will be somewhat under - estimated because the different samples are not completely independent of one another .",
    "the best - fit model profiles are shown against the stellar densities in figure [ fig : rpbgfit ] .",
    "a formal model is not fit to the @xmath103 sample because the center of the galaxy is not represented in this sample . instead",
    ", this sample is modeled by the functional parameters fit to the @xmath102 sample but scaled to the same average density of stars as the @xmath102 sample in fields where both samples are represented ; the result is overplotted on the @xmath102 sample as open circles .",
    "table [ tab : rpkingfits ] shows the considerable agreement of all our samples in each derived morphological parameter and their general consistency with most of the literature values ( though see ",
    "figure [ fig : sclmaglimdist ] shows the king limiting radius for the various samples , and the differences are nearly imperceptible .",
    "the consistency between the model parameters found for the rgb / rhb and bhb samples is especially gratifying given the differences in the selection methodology used for each sample and the expected relative purity of the bhb sample .",
    "the only parameters with variations inconsistent with the formal errors are the center coordinates . however , given the flatness of the surface density in the sculptor core and our uneven sampling of sculptor with position angle , the profile center is not well constrained ; the observed @xmath217 center coordinate variations are , therefore , not surprising .",
    "to check for possible correlations between parameters presumably more susceptible to the uneven @xmath210 coverage of the data , the fitting program was also run with the center coordinates , @xmath210 , and @xmath218 fixed to their tabulated mean values ; no significant changes in the derived @xmath219 and @xmath11 from the best - fit values in table [ tab : rpkingfits ] were found .",
    "comparison of tables [ tab : rpkingfits ] and [ tab : rpplcfits ] reveals an important difference between the king and plc fits : the model - estimated backgrounds are significantly larger in the king fits than they are in the plc fits , and they are larger than those found by the background estimations described in  5.1 .",
    "the explanation lies in the mismatch between the actual distribution of sculptor stars and a king profile .",
    "this difference is portrayed by ( 1 ) the distributions of stars in figure [ fig : sclmaglimdist ] , which show an `` extratidal '' population with declining radial density _ outside _ the best - fit king limiting radii , and ( 2 ) by the poor fit of the king profile to the density distribution at the largest radii in figure [ fig : rpbgfit ] .",
    "the issue of whether a king profile is _ physically _",
    "meaningful for a dsph system aside , the adopted , one component king function ( equation [ eq : kingprof ] ) simply is not _ mathematically _ suited to accommodating the approximately @xmath220 decline of the sculptor surface density at large radii .",
    "when allowed to `` find '' the background on its own , the king profile fit averages the `` extratidal '' sculptor stars into the mean background level . on the other hand , the plc fit , which is _ designed _ to accommodate a power law decline in density , obtains background estimates much closer to those estimated from the control fields and the `` cmd offset '' method .",
    "on the other hand , the plc models fail to account for the apparent inflection point , or `` break '' , in the radial profile near @xmath19 , where the slope of the profile apparently changes .    to remedy this problem , we next attempt king function fits where the backgrounds are fixed to our measured (  5.1 ) values .",
    "since the only measurable background density in the control fields is for the @xmath102 and @xmath103 samples , only for these do we use @xmath198 to estimate the background ; for the other samples we use @xmath196 .",
    "we are then , in effect , always using the _ larger _ of the two background estimates . as expected , however , the results are unsatisfactory in that they now result in clearly exaggerated tidal radii ( figure [ fig : fixbgking ] ) ; in attempting to compensate for an observed density profile that now clearly shows a significant density at large radii , the fitting code must inflate @xmath11 .    on the other hand , the density profile _ within _",
    "the break radius _ is _ well described by the initial king profile fit , which is largely insensitive to the low density outskirts of our maps due to the overestimated background level .",
    "this is demonstrated by figure [ fig : allsamprp ] , which compares the original king profile fits to the the true density distributions accounting for the _ measured _ background levels .",
    "the measured background levels are subtracted from the points plotted and , as in figure [ fig : rpbgfit ] , are shown to highlight where our data reach @xmath221 . in the case of the bhb stars the @xmath221 limit is apparently _ beyond the limits of our main sculptor survey_. as figure [ fig : allsamprp ] demonstrates , the central regions of the dsph are , in fact , well described by the king profiles in table [ tab : rpkingfits ] down to approximately three orders of magnitude below the central density ; for this reason , we feel it is justified to adopt the parameters found in table [ tab : rpkingfits ] as appropriate descriptors for the central sculptor populations . however , a diffuse `` break '' population dominates the density beyond the king limiting radius .",
    "like other dsphs we have studied in a similar manner ( @xcite ) , sculptor can be described by a `` king+break '' ( k+b ) profile  a characteristic seen in models of tidal - disrupting satellite galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see  6 ) .",
    "this break is compared to a least - squares fitted and @xmath222 power - laws in figure [ fig : allsamprp ] .    from table [ tab : rpplcfits ]",
    "we see that the plc profile parameters are fairly consistent except in the case of the @xmath107 sample where the small sample size is apparently causing difficulty in the fit .",
    "a notable characteristic of the plc fits is their @xmath223 index , a value for which the plc model reduces to a projected plummer model . as we pointed out above and",
    "show in figures [ fig : rpbgfit ] and [ fig : allsamprp ] , while the plc fits seem to give better matches to the data _ over all radii _ , they do not account for the profile break and increasingly fail to match the measured density at large radii .",
    "the @xmath223 indices derived with the plc fits correspond to @xmath224 density declines  faster than the @xmath225 declines that provide a better fit to the outer densities ( e.g. , see left panels in figure [ fig : allsamprp ] ) .",
    "this particular failing of the plc models is illustrated , for example , by the fact that in the @xmath107 case , the plc - fit `` background '' is nearly an order of magnitude higher than that calculated ( table [ tab : cmdbg ] ) .    to put a more quantitative measure on the relative quality of the fits using the different backgrounds and surface density profiles , we have calculated a simple @xmath226 statistic to determine best - fitting sets of parameters .",
    "the _ a posteriori_-calculated @xmath226 statistic is used simply as a relative figure of merit to intercompare models . ] using the data presented in figures [ fig : rpbgfit ] and [ fig : allsamprp ] ; the results are tabulated in table [ tab : fitchi ] . for the `` king+break '' (  k+b \" ) profiles ,",
    "the break population is modeled by both the least - squares fitted and an adopted @xmath220 power - law .",
    "the starting radius of the power law ( given in table [ tab : fitchi ] ) , @xmath227 , is that which yields the best @xmath226 value ; the normalization is determined by the value of the model king profile at @xmath227 .",
    "in general , when compared to the simple king profile ( without a break component ) , the plc model proves to be a better fit when using either the model or measured @xmath228 .",
    "however , in two out of the four cases determined using the measured @xmath228 , a k+b profile provides a better fit to the data than does the plc profile .",
    "moreover , the k+b profile provides a better fit when compared to a simple king profile _ even when the inflated , model @xmath228 is used _ ; the one exception is the @xmath101 sample , which has only one point that could be confidently considered part of a break population .",
    "the overall consistency of @xmath227 across all samples is encouraging given that it is independently determined for each sample .    while providing comparable fits to the overall distribution , the failings of the plc models to match the observed features ( density and inflection point ) at large radii are the primary reasons why , in the end , we prefer the k+b profile description for the sculptor morphology . but for either the plc or k+b description ,",
    "a clear and relevant point is that sculptor extends to the edge of our main survey field ( @xmath229 from the sculptor center ) , within which there does not seem to be a `` sculptor - free '' , background region .",
    "our derived king profile fit parameters ( table [ tab : rpkingfits ] )  in particular @xmath210 , @xmath218 , and @xmath219  are in general agreement with previously measured values for sculptor .",
    "the most important difference appears to be that we consistently find king limiting radii near the upper end of the previously reported range and twice that of the lower estimates , most notably the recent ccd study by @xcite .",
    "only the @xcite value for the limiting radius is larger than ours .",
    "we find a large king limiting radius despite our adoption of the king parameters derived with the artificially inflated , _ model - fit _ backgrounds . as found in previous attempts to fit the sculptor radial profile ( see  1 ) , we also find that use of the _ measured _ background level increases our derived king limiting radius and , also , reduces the quality of the fit at smaller radii as shown in figure [ fig : fixbgking ] .",
    "moreover , we find a sizable excess density _ beyond _ the king limiting radius when using either the measured or the model - fit background .",
    "as @xcite have done , we have also spectroscopically confirmed sculptor velocities for several of these outliers .    the origin of the difference in our measured king radius compared to that found in other studies",
    "is not likely due to differences in the depth of the data .",
    "our actual imaging limit is comparable to that of all of the previous studies , except the @xcite study , which reaches @xmath230 magnitudes _ deeper _ than our data .",
    "instead , the difference in model fits probably lies in the significantly better @xmath33 delivered by our _ methodology _ , which allows us to explore the dsph to substantially larger radius with much greater sensitivity .",
    "all previous sculptor surveys employed simple statistical starcounts to map the dsph . figure [ fig : bgdemon ] demonstrates the significant improvement gained by our approach : we compare the equivalent sculptor radial @xmath33 ( given by @xmath231 ) profiles delivered by our data when we ( 1 ) adopt the traditional , simple starcounting approach to measure the radial density ( i.e. , all stars detected are used to determine both @xmath232 and @xmath233 ) , ( 2 ) mimic a `` cmd - filtered '' starcount analysis whereby only stars meeting our cmd criterion for rgb / rhb selection are used to measure the density , and ( 3 ) adopt _ both _ our 2cd and cmd selection criteria to find only the most reliable sculptor giant candidates , as discussed in  3 . in all cases ,",
    "we use the @xmath102 sample . as may be seen , making use of color - magnitude information to tune the starcount selection to the sculptor rgb / rhb does",
    "improve the @xmath33 of a survey by about a factor of @xmath22 over simple star counting techniques ( as used by , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "but even this cmd filtering falls far short of the nearly 200 times lower background achieved by using the two - criteria , washington@xmath38 technique to weed out foreground dwarf stars first .",
    "the radius at which the profile density sinks to the associated background is @xmath234 using simple starcounts and @xmath235 using the cmd selection for rgb / rhb stars , but expands to beyond @xmath236 for the 2cd _ and _ cmd - filtered , giant star candidate sample .",
    "note , because sculptor is situated near the sgp , it represents the _ best _ situation with regard to foreground dwarf contamination ; thus , use of the washington@xmath38 approach should have a greater impact on the study of lower latitude systems .",
    "the actual situation with regard to previous sculptor studies is actually worse than demonstrated in figure [ fig : bgdemon ] .",
    "for example , in both @xcite and @xcite the authors did not discriminate between stars and background galaxies , but counted _ all _ sources in their survey .",
    "however , as demonstrated by , e.g. , @xcite , at @xmath237 galaxies actually outnumber stars at the ( north ) galactic pole by approximately 5:1 . in the sculptor field near the sgp ,",
    "the background in our star counts profile becomes 2.1 or 1.6 times greater if we make no image morphology cuts or do not select against likely galaxies ( large @xmath59 at faint @xmath41 ) , respectively .",
    "were one to probe to deeper magnitudes in search of more dsph - rich regions of the cmd ( e.g. , beyond the msto ) , one might be thwarted by the fact that the galaxy contamination rate not only rises faster than the contribution from field star contaminants , but it rises faster than the typical luminosity function of the dsphs themselves ( see , e.g. , the luminosity functions for old stellar populations summarized in figure 5 of * ? ? ?",
    "obviously , such contamination will have its greatest impact on the lowest density regions of the dsph , but even the core regions of the @xcite and @xcite studies have been significantly impacted by the lack of galaxy pruning .",
    "the quoted source counts of ih95 are about _ an order of magnitude _ greater in the sculptor core than we find from the sum of all our stellar detections after removing morphologically - discriminated galaxies . yet",
    "the @xcite study only probes slightly fainter . on the other hand , the @xcite survey probes 2.5 mag deeper than ours , so they would be expected to have a higher source density in the core . however , assuming the luminosity function of sculptor is approximately like that of a globular cluster ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we find an expected factor of @xmath238 in sculptor stars gained by the increased depth of @xcite , which can not account for the w03 factor of @xmath239 greater central surface density compared to our morphologically - discriminated counts in the sculptor center",
    ".    we can also directly compare the @xmath33 of our washington@xmath38 filtered counts to those _ adopted by _ the @xcite and @xcite studies .",
    "using table 3 from @xcite and figure 5 from @xcite , we find peak values of @xmath240 and @xmath241 for these studies , respectively .",
    "in contrast , we have a peak @xmath242 for our data ( figure [ fig : bgdemon ] ) .",
    "these @xmath33 comparisons are slightly misrepresentative because the backgrounds in these previous surveys were actually calculated at smaller radii , where sculptor stars contribute .",
    "finally , it is worth pointing out that tracing sculptor by its bhb stars yields results with comparable @xmath33 to those from our washington@xmath38 giant star mapping technique . given the expense of obtaining the narrow - band @xmath43 photometry , it would seem that simply mapping bhb stars with broadband photometry may be a more effective means to explore the extended structure of the sculptor dsph .",
    "however , we stress that our long - term goal is not only to determine the _ spatial _ characteristics of sculptor and other dsph systems , but to derive their large - scale _ dynamics _ , and giant stars are much more accessible spectroscopic targets than are bhb stars at the same distance . in this vein ,",
    "figure [ fig : bgdemon ] has important bearing on the prospects for spectroscopic studies of the sculptor dsph at very large radii : by a semi - major axis radius of @xmath243 ( i.e. , 2.5 king limiting radii ) , less than 5% of @xmath102 stars in the rgb part of the cmd are actually part of sculptor , which has a density of @xmath244 deg@xmath186 ( figure [ fig : allsamprp ] ) .",
    "thus , even with wide field , multifiber spectroscopy , it will not be possible to explore sculptor rgb stars at such large radii efficiently if the input sample is selected only as `` rgb - like '' stars in the cmd .",
    "( note that while they are easier to find as `` needles in the haystack '' , bhb stars have a sky density an order of magnitude _ smaller _ than that of the rgb , and , of course , they are fainter . )",
    "it is in this very low regime , where our relatively reliably identified samples of @xmath245-selected rgb stars are therefore particularly valuable .",
    "break populations are just one feature associated with satellites undergoing tidal disruption .",
    "discernible tidal tails and internal substructure ( e.g. , lumpiness and s - shapes ) are others . @xcite",
    "point out the possibility of a tidal tail extending to the southeast at a semi - major axis radius of @xmath246 to @xmath16 ( note that this is `` extratidal '' for them , but well inside our newly determined king limiting radius ) .",
    "moreover , both @xcite and @xcite report an increasing sculptor ellipticity with radius , which is an effect one would observe if tidal arms were forming @xcite .",
    "our high @xmath33 sculptor maps offer the opportunity to look for these previously noted features .",
    "figure [ fig : all.cont ] plots contours of the inner regions of all but our @xmath103 sample .",
    "we also over - plot the @xmath102 and @xmath107 samples ( figure [ fig : all.cont]e ) to show the strong correspondence between the spatial distribution of these two samples where the spatial coverage overlaps . finally , to give our most complete representation of sculptor",
    ", we have plotted contours derived from the combined @xmath102 and @xmath107 samples ( figure [ fig : all.cont]f ) .",
    "figure [ fig : all.cont ] displays interesting aspects of the central distribution of sculptor stars . an increase in the ellipticity of sculptor with radius is apparent from both the @xmath101 and @xmath102 contour plots : while the dsph is more or less round within about @xmath247 , it becomes extended in the east - west direction at larger radii , as has been previously noted ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , while these maps show a slightly higher density toward the northeast in our rgb / rhb samples , with none of our samples can we confirm a sculptor extension to the southeast as reported by @xcite .",
    "as one possible explanation for the difference we draw attention to the comment made by @xcite that the interpretation of possible tidal extensions in their data might have been influenced by the fact that their contour maps made were made without benefit of star / galaxy discrimination in their source catalog ; we have already discussed (  5.2.4 ) how significant a contribution galaxies are likely to be to the @xcite source counts . on the other hand , the sculptor maps of @xcite ( see their figure 1f ) also suggest an extension of sculptor to the northeast albeit at lower significance than we see in our maps .",
    "it is interesting that this extension is along the direction of the sculptor proper motion as determined by @xcite , as might be expected for tidal debris .    as a further demonstration of the increasing ellipticity with radius and to assess the apparent northeast excess ( which would imply isophotal twisting ) , figure [ fig : elong ]",
    "maps the azimuthal trends of the mean sculptor density for different radial annuli for both the @xmath101 and @xmath102 samples . for this analysis ,",
    "the radial annulus sectors are shaped according to the ellipticity parameters derived from the mean fit to the entire galaxy ( line 5 in table [ tab : rpkingfits ] ) and radial plots were determined for azimuthal bins . if the model ellipse is a perfect fit at a particular semi - major axis radius , there should be no azimuthal trend in density and all sectors should have the model surface density . if , on the other hand , the galaxy is _ more _ or _ less _ elliptical than the model at a given radius , then the density will show variations from the model : in the case of ellipticity changing at a fixed pa , one will find an _ increase _ in the density over the model along the semi - major axis @xmath210s and _ deficits _ along the semi - minor axes , whereas if it is _ rounder _ it will show the opposite trend .",
    "any isophotal twisting ( as , for example , one might see with the onset of well - defined tidal tails ) will be evidenced as azimuthal shifts of such features with radius .",
    "the radial bins in figure [ fig : elong ] are logarithmically and coarsely spaced to improve the signal - to - noise of the points . our ability to interpret this figure",
    "is complicated by the small area represented by annuli at short radii and incomplete survey coverage at larger radii .",
    "nevertheless , figure [ fig : elong ] seems to confirm the impression that the galaxy changes shape from rounder than our global fitted shape to more elongated than our global fitted shape between @xmath248 and @xmath249 .",
    "the data do not show obvious signs of isophotal twisting , but are of insufficient quality to do so reliably .",
    "the idea of a metallicity spread within sculptor has long been recognized from photometric studies of its giant branch , @xcite , via studies of its rr lyrae population @xcite , and through spectroscopic analysis @xcite . @xcite",
    "have argued that this spread is really a _ bimodal _ population distribution described by populations with [ fe / h ] @xmath250 and @xmath251 ; it was suggested to possibly be trimodal by @xcite .",
    "spatial gradients in the sculptor populations ( whether due to a true gradient or as a change in mixing ratio of a bimodal metallicity distribution ) have also previously been explored @xcite . given our larger area coverage of sculptor than in previous studies and the more reliable catalog of giant stars we have created , it is worthwhile to re - evaluate the spatial distributions of stars with apparently different metallicities .",
    "since we have no better indicator of intrinsic metallicity for the bulk of our giants other than their position in the cmd , we divide our rgb populations into `` metal - rich '' ( red ) and `` metal - poor '' ( blue ) halves by fitting a fourth order polynomial to the center of the cmd locus of the rgb as shown in figure [ fig : splitcmd ] .",
    "this division into metallicity halves is reasonable whether or not sculptor s metallicity distribution function is bimodal or more continuous .",
    "figure [ fig : cumdist]a shows the cumulative radial distributions of these two rgb halves for our @xmath101 sample , where the stars have been binned along the abscissa in terms of their equivalent semi - major axis distance from the sculptor center . to make these distributions",
    ", we have fixed the sculptor center , @xmath210 , and @xmath218 to that of the mean of our best - fitted king models ( table [ tab : rpkingfits ] ) .",
    "the separation of the blue and red rgb distributions is clear , with the more metal - rich sculptor population being more centrally concentrated ( as has been found by previous studies ) .",
    "the difference in these two distributions is quantified using a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test and the results are given in table [ tab : ks ] .",
    "this table provides the effective number of data points ( @xmath252 ) , the k - s statistic ( @xmath253 ) , and the k - s significance level ( ks% ) , as calculated by the algorithms provided by @xcite .",
    "the results of this test show a strong disagreement with the null hypothesis that these two spatial distributions are the same .",
    "we repeat the analysis with deeper probes of the rgb , but here we meet with a population mixing problem due to contamination of the `` blue '' rgb by the sculptor rhb .",
    "the rhb population properly belongs to the _ red _ ( metal - rich ) rgb ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and therefore , a simple rgb division will tend to _ wash out _ the difference in the distributions between the red and blue populations .",
    "we have removed the cmd regions of our @xmath102 sample that are clearly dominated by rhb stars , but have left in the sample that part of the cmd where the rhb and the blue rgb overlap ( compare figures [ fig : cmd2 ] and [ fig : splitcmd ] ) .",
    "this residual rhb contamination of the blue rgb sample will cause a modest dilution of the red / blue spatial distinction . indeed , while we find the distributions of the blue and red stars in figure [ fig : cumdist]b to be significantly different , they are slightly less so than in the @xmath101 case ( note the difference in k - s probabilities in table [ tab : ks ] ) .    obviously , we expect the bhb sample , which belongs to the more metal - poor sculptor population , to track the spatial distribution of the blue rgb sample .",
    "we test this by comparing the @xmath254 sample to the two @xmath102 samples in figure [ fig : cumdist]c . to do this fairly , we have excluded sky regions of the @xmath102 samples that are not included in the @xmath254 sample .",
    "it is hard to distinguish between the bhb and blue rgb samples , as might be expected ( figure [ fig : cumdist]c ) , and the distributions _ are identical _ at the 99% level as given by the k - s test . on the other hand ,",
    "the bhb distribution is significantly different than that of the red rgb sample .    to further illustrate their different distributions ,",
    "the blue and red rgb distributions have been individually fit with king model profiles .",
    "the best - fitting parameters are given in table [ tab : rpsplitfits ] , the individual radial profiles illustrated in figure [ fig : splitrp ] and the sky distributions shown in figure [ fig : sclsplitdist ] together with their best - fitting king limiting ellipses . the background , @xmath196 , for each radial profile has been determined using the `` cmd offset '' method for each half of the rgb .",
    "again , the greater concentration of the metal - rich population is apparent by comparing , for example , the differences in the core / limiting radii in table [ tab : rpsplitfits ] .",
    "however , our new , wide area data now show this spatial difference to be maintained to the nominal @xmath255 limiting radius of the system and beyond .",
    "while both metallicity populations apparently contribute to the `` break '' population beyond this radius , the metal - poor population density is greater than the metal - rich population there by an order of magnitude .",
    "the radial gradient in the make - up of sculptor is also demonstrated in figure [ fig : splitrp ] by the variation of the fractional population balance parameter , @xmath256 , where @xmath89 and @xmath257 are the number of blue and red rgb stars within an elliptical annulus .",
    "interestingly , the small east - west extension of the metal - rich population as seen in figure [ fig : sclsplitdist ] leads to the finding of a _",
    "greater _ ellipticity compared to that for the metal - poor population .",
    "we have undertaken the most sensitive morphological survey of the sculptor dsph system to date . our ability to increase the",
    "signal - to - noise of the measured sculptor structure is due to our orders of magnitude improved signal - to - background , @xmath33 , over that in previous work . by using the washington@xmath38 photometric system to create maps of sculptor giant stars , and by taking advantage of the strong contrast of sculptor bhb stars to galactic field stars of the same color , we are able to reduce substantially the backgrounds , @xmath89 , in our maps and thereby track the radial profile of very high probability sculptor stars to the largest angular extents ( @xmath258 ) explored for this system thus far . at the edge of our survey area ,",
    "the primary limit on our ability to resolve detailed _ two - dimensional _ structure on the scale of tens of arcminutes is the quantization noise of individual bhb and rgb sources at low densities .      1 .   through spectroscopic follow - up of 157 stars",
    "we verify that our washington@xmath38 methodology to select candidate sculptor rgb stars actually produces true sculptor members with a 94% reliability rate .",
    "thus our sculptor rgb candidates can be trusted to give an accurate tracing of the structure of the sculptor system .",
    "admittedly , this reliability rate comes at some expense in terms of completeness , and we have identified some radial velocity members of sculptor with color - color - magnitude combinations that place these stars _ just outside _ our conservative selection criteria . 2 .",
    "the sculptor structural parameters are derived anew .",
    "both simple king models and power law + core ( plc ) models provide unsatisfactory descriptions of the full sculptor density distribution over the full range of our survey . neither can properly account for a `` break '' to a shallower , approximately @xmath220 radial density fall - off near a semi - major axis radius of @xmath9 . on the other hand ,",
    "the sculptor radial profile is well - fit by a king profile _ within _ this radius , so that , as we have found for other dsph systems we have explored ( @xcite ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , sculptor is well - described by a `` king + power law '' function .",
    "once adopting this prescription to account for the extended break population around sculptor , we find central king model parameters that are within the range of those found previously by other studies , but an @xmath259 king limiting radius that is at the high end of those previously reported ; most notably , our limiting radius is nearly twice that found by the recent , deep ccd starcount survey by @xcite .",
    "we argue that such discrepancies arise from substantially higher contamination by both foreground stars and background galaxies in the previous surveys , which limited their effective signal - to - noise , particularly in the more diffuse outer regions of sculptor . as a cautionary measure",
    ", we assess the dependence of our own derived king radius on adopted background .",
    "we consistently find @xmath260 , despite allowing our fitting program to use an inflated background that is at least a factor of two , and up to an order of magnitude , larger than the background _ measured _ in control fields @xmath55 from the sculptor center .",
    "we confirm the existence of an extended component to the sculptor system beyond the @xmath261 king limiting radius , and map this break population to the @xmath229 extent of our main survey area .",
    "an exorbitantly large background density would need to be adopted to eliminate this excess population at large radii . instead",
    ", two independent methods used to measure our background levels agree that they are very low , and demonstrate that we detect the sculptor break population at a @xmath262 at the @xmath229 limit of our survey , and with @xmath263 ( depending on which sample of stars we use ) near the break radius . given this degree of significance , there can be no doubt that this break population is real .",
    "moreover , the break population is seen with both rgb / rhb _ and _ bhb stars , and we have at least three ( see  4.6 ) stars in the break population spectroscopically confirmed ( * ? ? ?",
    "* report an additional two ) .",
    "we stress this point because our previous detection ( @xcite ) of a break population around the carina dsph using the same methodology has been questioned by @xcite and @xcite ( but has been shown to be real in @xcite and again in @xcite ) .",
    "the contrast of sculptor rgb stars in its break population with respect to other field stars at the same color and magnitude are so low that simple strategies to pick such stars out of the cmd for spectroscopic follow - up will result in relatively low rates for uncovering actual sculptor giants  for example , less than 5% at 2.5 king radii . plowing through large numbers of stars with multifiber spectroscopy is not necessarily the best solution to probing the dynamics of sculptor rgb stars at large radii , since the density of @xmath102 rgb stars is @xmath264 at 2.5 king limiting radii .",
    "in contrast , at the same radius our washington@xmath38 sculptor rgb sample is expected to increase the success rate for finding _ bona fide _ sculptor stars by more than an order of magnitude , and at a density efficiently probed with single slit spectroscopy .",
    "we hope to undertake this type of follow - up work , and have presented a successful proof of concept with results using the magellan telescope and mike spectrograph here .",
    "the two - dimensional structure of sculptor shows evidence for a change in ellipticity with radius , from rounder to more elliptical , as previously reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our deeper data sets also show an extension from sculptor to the northeast along the direction of the @xcite proper motion vector .",
    "this feature , lying between @xmath247 and @xmath16 , is also seen at lower significance in the contour plot by @xcite .",
    "we do not , however , confirm the extended feature to the southeast reported by @xcite .",
    "preliminary dynamical results using a total of 134 sculptor stars ranging out to @xmath265 king limiting radii show a mean sculptor velocity of @xmath266 , a global velocity dispersion of @xmath5 , and no evidence for rotation . the radial trend of the velocity dispersion for our sculptor stars is found to be relatively flat , however , as found in other dsph systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) , sculptor may show a rise in velocity dispersion beyond @xmath6 .",
    "in @xcite we show how such a profile is one signature of tidally disrupting satellites on very radial orbits . 7 .",
    "when the sculptor rgb is divided into red and blue halves , representing predominantly more metal - rich and more metal - poor sculptor populations , a clear difference in spatial distributions is observed .",
    "the more metal - rich giant stars are more centrally concentrated and , interestingly , more elliptically - distributed , than the metal - poor giants .",
    "the distribution of bhb stars closely follows the distribution of blue rgb ( metal - poor ) stars , as expected .",
    "these metallicity - dependent differences in spatial distribution echo previous findings @xcite .",
    "spatial and dynamical characteristics of the sculptor system reported here ( e.g. , the clearly detected break population , signs of increasing ellipticity with radius , and a rising / flat velocity dispersion profile ) are classic signatures of a dwarf satellite undergoing tidal disruption . in this interpretation",
    ", the galactic gravitational tides are stretching sculptor at large radii internal to tidal radius , and stripping stars that extend into a break population beyond the nominal king limiting radius ( which might then actually correspond to the tidal radius of the system ) .",
    "k+b density profiles are consistent with model expectations for the appearance of a tidally disrupting dwarf galaxy in a mw - like potential @xcite , where the break population represents unbound stars .",
    "unbound stars at all radii can inflate the velocity dispersion and lead to the observed flat velocity dispersion profile ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* @xcite ) .    on the other hand , breaks _ within _",
    "the tidal radius of a disrupting system have also been found in some n - body models explored by @xcite .",
    "thus , sculptor could be tidally disrupting , and still have the observed break population be bound . on the other hand , if one calculates where the tidal radius of sculptor should be from its mass relative to that of the mw one finds that it is close to , or less than , the observed king limiting radius assuming a sculptor mass of 1.5@xmath267 m@xmath268 , consistent with an assumed @xmath269 in solar units ( ih95 ) ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and assuming a low orbital eccentricity ( @xmath270 ) , equation 1 by @xcite yields a tidal radius @xmath271 for a sculptor mass of 1.5@xmath267 m@xmath268 . a higher eccentricity ( @xmath272 ) orbit yields a smaller tidal radius , @xmath273 . the @xcite orbit determined for sculptor implies @xmath274 , between these two values .",
    "a characteristic of _ all _ of the numerous orbiting satellite models presented in the @xcite study is an increase in the isophotal ellipticity as a function of radius .",
    "this increase in ellipticity is greater for those satellites on more circular orbits .",
    "@xcite give observational signatures that help in determining the physical process behind the development of the structures seen in their models .",
    "they define the radius where the ellipticity of an originally circular model satellite becomes @xmath275 as @xmath276 and the innermost radius at which the change in the slope of the density power - law becomes @xmath277 as @xmath227 .",
    "their simulations show that if @xmath278 and the slope of the power law beyond @xmath227 ( @xmath279 ) is greater than @xmath280 , the likely cause of the distortions and break population is tidal stripping .",
    "we estimate @xmath281 from figures [ fig : all.cont]b and [ fig : elong ] and @xmath282 and @xmath283 from figure [ fig : allsamprp ] .",
    "these numbers satisfy the above conditions for tidal stripping set by the simulations .",
    "yet another explanation for the break population is that it is a dynamically hotter , but _ bound _",
    "component to the sculptor system .",
    "if sculptor has a significant , extended dark matter component , as has recently been reported for the draco dsph @xcite , a bound stellar component extending to twice the king limiting radius might be accommodated .",
    "however , sculptor is at the low end of the dsph @xmath13 range , with an inferred central @xmath284 , ) is only slightly larger than that found previously by @xcite ( @xmath285 ) and values of our velocity dispersion at small radii are insignificantly different from that of @xcite ( @xmath286 ; see figure [ fig : rvprof ] ) . since @xmath287 , a recalculation of @xmath13 using our new values would yield a 1520% smaller value than previously determined ( @xmath288 ; @xcite ) ; an insignificant difference considering the large errors associated with the calculation . ] compared to the central draco @xmath13 of @xmath289 ( or even larger  @xmath290  as recently reported by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so it seems less likely that the break population of sculptor stars is sheltered within a massive dark matter halo of the inferred size of draco s . on the other hand ,",
    "the extraordinary inflation of the draco @xmath13 by @xcite was a direct result of an observed flat velocity dispersion , as we have seen here . given this tendency for some modelers to accommodate the flat dispersions profiles by adding mass to the dsph at large radii , it is likely that a convincing dismissal of the `` large dark matter halo '' interpretation will require tracking the break population , both photometrically and spectroscopically , to even larger radii , to the point where obvious tidal tails should be discernible .",
    "however , because n - body models of disrupting satellites have been found that can explain flat velocity dispersion profiles _ and _ k+b radial density profiles ( @xcite ) , we believe that the weight of evidence for tidal disruption models is now greater , and so explore this interpretation further here .    assuming the break population is from tidal disruption",
    ", we can calculate the fractional mass - loss rate of sculptor based on our newly mapped radial profile . for satellites on circular orbits , the mass loss is due to constant stripping of the satellite over time . for more eccentric orbits ,",
    "the mass loss comes in more violent pulses when the satellite passes perigalacticon .",
    "@xcite give two prescriptions for the derivation of the mass - loss rate , which have been modified by the more recent analysis of @xcite .",
    "using the corrected formula for the mass loss from the above simulations , table [ tab : dfdt ] gives the resulting fractional mass - loss rates for the various samples in this paper .",
    "the last `` reliable '' point that defines @xmath227 is taken as the last point that is consistent with the @xmath10 fall - off .",
    "the mean of the values in table [ tab : dfdt ] are @xmath291 and @xmath292 .",
    "this is a relatively mild fractional mass - loss rate yet places it squarely on the trend of increasing fractional mass - loss rate with inferred @xmath293 noted by ( * ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite discuss as one explanation for this trend an increase in tidal disruption in systems that have a larger _ inferred @xmath13 _ ( see also majewski 2002 ) . that sgr  which is clearly losing mass into tidal arms to create _",
    "its _ break population  participates in this trend lends support for this notion @xcite .",
    "if sculptor is losing stars due to tidal stripping , our analysis of the different stellar populations (  5.4 ) suggests that sculptor would be contributing stars to the mw halo predominantly from its more metal - poor population .",
    "extrapolated back in time , this differential mass loss would suggest that sculptor once had a larger metal - poor population . whereas the two sculptor populations  as we have divided them  are roughly equal in proportion ,",
    "if we extrapolate the sculptor mass loss backwards for @xmath294 we find that the original metal poor population would have been about 50% larger .",

    "<S> we explore the spatial distribution of stars in the sculptor dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxy over an area of 7.82 deg@xmath0 , including coverage of the central region but extending mostly south and east of the dsph core . </S>",
    "<S> two methods are used to identify stars that are most likely associated with the dsph , and these filtered samples of stars are used to map its spatial structure . </S>",
    "<S> first , following the method of previous contributions in this series , we utilize washington @xmath1 photometry to identify red giant branch ( rgb ) star candidates with approximately the same distance and metallicity as the sculptor dsph . </S>",
    "<S> second , a prominent blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) population provides a fairly populous and pure sample of sculptor stars having broadband colors unlike the bulk of the galactic field star population . </S>",
    "<S> a spectroscopically observed subset of sculptor candidate stars ( 147 total stars : @xmath2 of all sculptor candidates , @xmath3 of sculptor giant candidates ) yields a systemic heliocentric velocity for the system of @xmath4 , in good agreement with previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> we also find a global velocity dispersion of @xmath5 with slight indications of a rise in the velocity dispersion past @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> these spectra also provide a check on the reliability of our candidate sculptor giant sample to @xmath7 : 94% of the photometrically - selected sculptor giant star candidates with follow - up spectroscopy are found to be kinematically associated with sculptor , while four out of ten stars outside of our sculptor giant star selection criteria that we tested spectroscopically appear to be velocity members of sculptor . </S>",
    "<S> these percentages are in agreement with results for an additional 22 sculptor field stars with radial velocities in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> all available velocities show that our methodology for picking sculptor giants is both reliable and conservative . </S>",
    "<S> thus , these giant star samples should provide a reliable means to explore the structure of the sculptor dsph . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , considerable care has been taken to assess the level of background contamination in our photometric sample to ensure an accurately derived density profile of the sculptor dsph to large radii . </S>",
    "<S> multiple background assessments verify that we detect a considerable stellar density of sculptor stars to the limits of our main survey area for both the rgb and bhb candidate samples . </S>",
    "<S> while we find that a king profile of limiting radius @xmath8 fits the density profile of sculptor well to @xmath9 , beyond this , we identify a `` break '' in the profile and a clearly detected population of sculptor stars following a @xmath10 decline to more than 2@xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> this break population must signify either the presence of an extremely broad distribution of bound `` halo stars '' around the sculptor dsph , or the presence of unbound tidal debris . if the latter is true , we determine a fractional mass - loss rate of approximately @xmath12 for the sculptor dsph </S>",
    "<S> . additional support for the notion that there is tidal disruption comes from the two - dimensional distribution of our sculptor candidate stars : both the rgb and bhb samples show increasingly elongated isodensity contours with radius that point to an apparent stretching reminiscent of what is seen in models of disrupting satellite galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we find that rgb stars that are more likely to be metal - poor ( based on their color and magnitude ) are significantly less centrally concentrated and therefore constitute the primary contributing stellar population to the likely tidally - stripped parts of the dsph . </S>"
