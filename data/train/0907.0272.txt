    "numerically , using the boundary condition of the multiple terminal junction in the tight - binding model , we calculate the andreev levels and the josephson currents in both short and long channel length limit . after considering the backscattering in the soi ring , large schottky barrier on the s / n interface",
    ", fermi wavelength mismatch between the superconducting leads and semiconducting ring , and the effect of the impurities in the ring , we find that the oscillations of the josephson current due to the ac phase are robust .",
    "the amplitude oscillation of the josephson current due to the ac effect in the d - c josephson junction is expected to be larger than the conductance oscialltions observed in normal ring structures without superconducting elements .",
    "these results suggest an alternative and likely better way to observe the ac phase .",
    "also , since one period oscillation of the ac phase only needs several mev , we provide a possible way to create josephson junction fets controlled by a voltage of the order of mev .",

    "we presents the detail discussion of the quasiparticle states in the gap in this appendix . as we know that the quasiparticle states in the superconductor can be described by the bogoliubov equation @xmath171 where @xmath2 is the one - electron hamiltonian , defined as @xmath172 where @xmath3 is the electrochemical potential",
    ", @xmath4 is the scalar potential and @xmath6 is the effective mass . for a homogeneous superconductor with @xmath173=@xmath174 and @xmath175 ,",
    "the solution of eq.[bogo ] can be written as @xmath176 where @xmath177 , @xmath72 is the phase of the superconductor .",
    "@xmath178 is corresponding to electron - like quasiparticle because in this case , @xmath179 .",
    "for the similar reason , @xmath180 is corresponding to the hole - like quasiparticle . here only the positive energy @xmath48 is considered . in 1-d case , given energy @xmath181 , there are four quasiparticles , two of them are the right moving particles and the other two are the left moving particles . when considering @xmath182 , according to eq.[uv ] , the wave vector @xmath126 satisfies @xmath183 where @xmath184 .",
    "therefor the wave vector @xmath126 has to take the form @xmath185 where the real part and imaginary part of @xmath126 satisfy @xmath186 given energy @xmath182 , the wave vectors of the quasiparticles in this case are corresponding to the four solutions of eq.[wsk2 ] .",
    "the solution of eq.([bogo ] ) will be @xmath187 as a result , @xmath188 .    if a normal conductor is coupled to a superconductor , a unique reflection with energy less than gap , namely andreev reflection , can be observed . to calculate the scattering matrix in the interface , we must know the input and output particles , which are corresponding to the right moving and left moving particles separately , in the superconducting lead . it is easy to find them when the energy is larger than the superconducting gap",
    ". however , when the energy is less than the superconducting gap , the wave vector has to be analytic continuous to complex plane eq.[wsk1 ] .",
    "it is hard to say which solution is corresponding the left moving or the right moving particle .",
    "we will figure out this problem by some concepts from retarded green s function .",
    "retarded green s function in the position and energy space , say @xmath189 , is viewed as two traveling wave function outward from a source term @xmath190 .",
    "the opposite case is so called advanced green s function . one way to calculate",
    "s matrix is to use retarded green function@xcite but not advanced green s function because we are interested in the case that if there is an excitation at some point , how the excited particle travels away from the point of the excitation .",
    "this kind of retarded green s function of a fermion is @xmath191 where @xmath192 , therefore we have a pole where @xmath193 . physically we hope that when @xmath194 , the integral gives us the right moving particle and when @xmath195 , the integral gives us the left moving particle .",
    "now let us come back to our question . in our discussion , the energy @xmath48 is chosen to be positive . as a result , @xmath196 must be in the first quadrant of a energy complex plane and just a little bit above the real axis .",
    "actually , eq.([wsk1 ] ) is a general form of wave vector .",
    "@xmath197 is infinitely small when energy @xmath181 and finite when energy @xmath182 .",
    "considering @xmath181 and according to eq.([wsk1 ] ) , the energy of the quasiparticles can be written as @xmath198 here @xmath197 is infinitely small and we neglect the @xmath199 term . since @xmath196 is in the first quadrant of the complex plane , @xmath200 .",
    "for the right moving electron - like quasiparticle @xmath201 , since @xmath202 and @xmath203 , @xmath197 must be also larger than zero , say the wave vector of the right moving electron - like quasiparticle of the first quadrant in complex wave vector plane .",
    "for the similar reason we have the results that the left moving electron - like quasiparticle @xmath204 is in the third quadrant , the right moving hole - like quasiparticle @xmath205 is in the second quadrant and the left moving hole - like quasiparticle @xmath206 is in the fourth quadrant .",
    "although we get this result in the case @xmath207 , it is also valid when @xmath208 because for the wave vectors , the case of @xmath182 is just the analytical continuous of that of @xmath181 . the wave functions of these four quasiparticles within the superconducting gap are @xmath209 where @xmath210 .",
    "an interesting conclusion should be noticed that in both the left and right superconducting leads , exponentially decay quasiparticles are always the input particles and exponentially increase quasiparticles are always output particles .",
    "the velocity of the electrons and the current carried by these electrons can be calculated through the velocity operator and electron current operator    @xmath211    where @xmath212 is the charge of an electron .",
    "the velocity of these decay quasiparticles are zero but the current carried by these are not zero .",
    "although eq.([vi ] ) shows that the current is decay , since the quasiparticle will decay to cooper pair@xcite which can carry a supercurrent , the total current due to one quasiparticle is @xmath213",
    "there have been many theoretical papers talking about the rashba interaction in a ring system , such as the eigenenergy , wavefunction and so on by the analytical method in the continuous case and the exact transmission function through the numerical calculation in the tight binding model",
    ". however the eigenenergy and wavefunction in the tight binding model is still undiscussed .",
    "although this is easy to be derived , we write down the conclusion briefly to make our paper more readable .",
    "the eigenfunction of this tight binding model hamiltonian is the same as the eigenfunction of the continuous hamiltonian .",
    "acting the tight binding model hamiltonian eq.[tighth ] on the wave function eq.[eigenf ] and focusing on @xmath214 gives us @xmath217 when @xmath218 , we have @xmath219)\\nonumber\\\\ & & n_{\\pm}=\\left(\\pm\\arccos\\left((1-\\frac{e}{2t_0})/\\sqrt{1+(\\frac{t_{so}}{t_0})^2}\\right)-\\beta\\right)/\\delta\\varphi+\\frac{1}{2}\\\\ & & e_{e , m}=2t_0(1-\\sqrt{1+(t_{so}/t_0)^2}\\cos[(m+1/2)\\delta\\varphi-\\beta])\\nonumber\\\\ & & m_{\\pm}=\\left(\\pm\\arccos\\left((1-\\frac{e}{2t_0})/\\sqrt{1+(\\frac{t_{so}}{t_0})^2}\\right)+\\beta\\right)/\\delta\\varphi-\\frac{1}{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 , @xmath220 and @xmath221 are corresponding to the counterclockwise rotation electron and @xmath222 and @xmath223 are corresponding to the clockwise rotation electron .",
