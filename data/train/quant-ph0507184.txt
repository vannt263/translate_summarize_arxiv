    "we will connect the entanglement of the initial coin state with the outcoming mean value in position space .",
    "an equation will be given that establishes the mean value as an entanglement measure for the initial coin state .",
    "further we will investigate the evolution of the entanglement in coin space .",

    "+ the hilbert space consists of two parts , a @xmath1dimensional coin space @xmath2 and a @xmath3dimensional position space @xmath4 .",
    "the quantum walk scheme consists only of applying repeatedly a special transformation operator @xmath5 to an inital state @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 the wave function @xmath8 consists of two parts , a part describing the coin state and the other giving the probability of the walker to be at a certain lattice site , @xmath9 .",
    "the transformation operator @xmath5 has two parts , one for the coin tossing and one for the shifting of the walker on the lattice . as an example we show here an operator with @xmath10 coins , which executes the operation depending on the state of qubit 2 : @xmath11 we use the unbiased tossing operator @xmath12 which means that after one step we have the same probability for going one step to the left or one step to the right .",
    "the shifting operators move the quantum walker on the one - dimensional lattice , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 marks the position .",

    "we use the methods described by nayak and vishwanath @xcite and by brun and coworkers @xcite to evaluate our scheme analytically . after applying a discrete fourier transformation to the quantum walk scheme",
    ", we get the @xmath18 operator in k - space : @xmath19 the time evolution can then easily be calculated by the eigenvalue decomposition of the @xmath20 operator . the calculation of the eigenvalues yields @xmath21 .",

    "@xmath43 we know from numerical evaluation , that the integral over the matrix @xmath44 is diagonal and that the entries have the same value : @xmath45 the integrals over the nondiagonal entries vanish . with these two informations",

    "as we have shown in @xcite , the entanglement structure of this state shows 2-qubit as well as 3-qubit entanglement .",
    "the i - concurrences for this state could easily be calculated , but are not so important in this case , because the mean value is 0 , independent from any parameter : @xmath80 these calculations are consistent with numerical simulations .",
    "thus it is confirmed that for mixed entanglements the mean value stays at zero . + the two 4-qubit states @xmath81 and @xmath82 are also eigenstates of a spin chain @xcite . the parameters @xmath83 and @xmath84 depend on two further parameters .",
    "the state @xmath81 @xmath85 with the norm @xmath86 , is only twopartite entangled . for simplicity we will only regard the i - concurrence reduced on qubit 1 and 3 , @xmath87 .",
    "it is again nicely seen that the mean value can be described with our equation ( [ mean ] ) : @xmath88 for the two other mean values can also be shown that they are connected to the i - concurrences , via eq.([mean ] ) .",
    "+ the entanglement structure for the state @xmath82 @xmath89 with the norm @xmath90 is a more complex state , since there is no possibility to show genuine 3-qubit or 4-qubit entanglement in a fourpartite state .",
    "but in @xcite we have shown that this state has besides the 2-qubit entanglement either 3-qubit or 4-qubit entanglement .",
    "the i - concurrences reduced to one qubit are parameter independent , @xmath91 .",
    "it can be shown for this state , that the mean values are 0 , @xmath92 these results are consistent with the 3-qubit problem and therefore we suggest the following general result , although this is not a general proof : for purely entangled coin - states ( 2-qubit , 3-qubit , ... ) we expect a square mean value proportional to the corresponding i - concurrence , while for mixed entanglements the squared mean value is always zero .",
    "to clear this point further we look in the following at the entanglement evolution of the wavefunction in the coin subspace . the complete wave function at time @xmath93 consists of two parts , one part in position space and additionally a part in coin subspace , @xmath94 .",
    "we will have a closer look at the states @xmath95 . with an artificial normalization of these states at each site one",
    "can calculate the global entanglement measure @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "+ we note the following results from our simulations : a ) for all starting coin states the entanglement structure is constant in time at the starting point on the lattice ; b ) at other lattice points we observe entanglement oscillations .",
    "these two effects are shown in fig.[globaltime ] , with the @xmath97ghz state as initial state .",
