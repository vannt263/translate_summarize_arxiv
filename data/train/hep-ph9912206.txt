    "the phenomenological interest in prompt - photon production in fixed - target experiments resides mainly in its use as a gluon probe in structure - function studies .",

    "this same region is relevant for hadron colliders in production phenomena at very large transverse momenta , and thus its understanding is crucial in order to disentangle possible new physics signals from the qcd background .    in this talk , we consider the effect of soft - gluon resummation in prompt - photon production  @xcite near the `` threshold '' limit , that is to say for high transverse momentum .",

    "this last mechanism is not fully calculable in perturbation theory and , in fact , it depends upon the photon fragmentation function . however , in the cases of practical interest , the corrections due to the fragmentation processes are small , and we shall limit our considerations to the hard - photon part . in this approximation ,",
