    "note that if the upper and lower @xmath1-densities are finite and positive at a point , this implies the pointwise dimension at that point is @xmath1 as well .",
    "in other words , @xmath3 having pointwise dimension @xmath1 at @xmath55 means that for all @xmath102 , @xmath103 for @xmath104 small enough , while having positive lower density means that @xmath105 for @xmath106 small and some constants @xmath107 .",
