    "the near - infrared ( ir ) [ ]  lines are useful tools for studying the radiative shocks of supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "the increased abundance of the gas phase iron by shock - induced sputtering of the dust grains and/or the creation of an extensive partially ionized zone by shock heating can substantially enhance the [ ]  emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this , together with less severe extinction effects than the optical and the recent advents of near - ir imaging cameras covering sufficiently wide fields ( e.g. , @xmath5 5 ) , can potentially make the observations of the near - ir [ ]  lines a very competitive and efficient way to study the radiative shocks of snrs , especially in the galactic plane where the extinction is usually large .",
    "a good example is the young core - collapse snr g11.2@xmath60.3 where we recently found the brightest near - ir [ ]  emission of all known snrs using wide - field infrared camera aboard the palomar 5-m telescope @xcite . besides g11.2@xmath60.3 , a few other snrs  such as rcw  103 @xcite , 3c  391 @xcite , w44 @xcite , and w49b @xcite ",

    "* ) , which is opposite to the standard picture of the molecular shocks where molecules form in the downstream behind a recombination region .",
    "this apparent pattern of the positional ` reversal ' between the [ ]  and h@xmath0  emission may have important clues to understanding the pre - supernova environment of snrs , calling more systematic investigation of the [ ]  and h@xmath0  emission together in ( young ) core - collapse snrs .",
    "in this paper we present the near - ir imaging and spectroscopic observations of [ ]  and h@xmath0  lines from another core - collapse snr 3c  396 ( also known as g39.20.3 ) . in radio 3c  396",

    "the measured velocity + 117 km s@xmath2  of [ ] -pk1 corresponds to a radial velocity of + 48 km s@xmath2  after subtraction of the contribution from the galactic rotation .",
    "if all the [ ]  emission in 3c  396 is originated from the surface of an expanding sphere of 25 ( or 6 pc ) radius which is the average distance of the western filament from the center , then the three dimensional expansion velocity of [ ] -pk1 is @xmath7 56 km s@xmath2 .",
    "( note that the radial velocity of the western filament is comparable to the systematic galactic rotational velocity of 3c  396 , indicating that the filament motion is largely transverse . )",
    "the obtained expansion velocity of 56 km s@xmath2  is too low to be ejecta ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which suggests that the [ ]  gas in 3c  396 is primarily the ambient or circumstellar gas swept up by the snr shock .",
    "generally the snr shocks become radiative at expansion velocities of @xmath43 200 km s@xmath2  @xcite , so that the above expansion velocity of 56 km s@xmath2  of 3c  396 appears to be consistent with the detection of the shocked [ ]  lines in this remnant .",
    "in addition , the de - reddened surface brightness ( 0.1  1.2 @xmath44 ergs @xmath26 s@xmath2 sr@xmath2 ) can be explained by a shock propagating into the gas of @xmath45 = 10@xmath46 ",
    "10@xmath47  @xmath4 with a velocity of 30  50 km s@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "there is only one conspicuous feature in the h@xmath0  2.12 @xmath9 m emission which is a long ( @xmath7 3 , or 7 pc ) filamentary emission along the southwestern boundary of 3c  396 ( figure  [ fig_h2 ] ) .",

    "figure  [ fig_twocolor ] compares the relative locations of the [ ]  and h@xmath0  emission , superimposed on the radio contours .",
    "it is apparent that the h@xmath0  emission is located slightly farther than the [ ]  emission from the snr center , and the former is linear as opposed to the latter which is curved along the bright radio emission .",
    "the [ ]  and h@xmath0  filaments are adjacent near the position of [ ] -pk1 , but are apparently separated at the edges .    across the southwest boundary of 3c  396 , the radio emission drops sharply ( figure  [ fig_rx ] ) .",
    "this , together with our detection of the h@xmath0  emission , strongly suggests that 3c  396 has encountered dense medium in this region , most likely a molecular cloud . in order to investigate this",
    "more we examined the distribution of molecular gas around 3c  396 using the galactic ring @xmath50co j=10 line survey @xcite and found molecular gas at @xmath51 = 6870 km s@xmath2   surrounding 3c  396 ( figure  [ fig_co ] ) .",
    "these velocities are consistent with the previously proposed systematic velocity of 3c  396 @xcite , and the location of the h@xmath0  filament that we found in this study matches the inner boundary of the molecular gas that forms a ring - like structure .",
    "therefore , it is likely that 3c  396 is indeed interacting with some of these molecular clouds .",
    "if we adopt the velocity ( 69 km s@xmath2 ) of the molecular gas as the systemic velocity of 3c  396 , its distance is 8.5 kpc which we use in this paper as the distance to 3c  396 .",
    "our h@xmath0  spectrum of h@xmath0-pk1 averaged over a 24@xmath16 area around the peak is shown in figure  [ fig_sph2 ] .",
    "the h@xmath0  2.12 @xmath9 m 1 - 0 s(1 ) line stands out clearly , while the detection of h@xmath0  2.03 @xmath9 m 1 - 0 s(2 ) line is marginal .",
    "the h@xmath0  2.07 @xmath9 m 2 - 1 s(3 ) line is not detected , which could be partly due to the incomplete oh airglow subtraction .",
    "the ratio of the h@xmath0  2.03 @xmath9 m 1 - 0 s(2 ) line to the 2.12 @xmath9 m 1 - 0 s(1 ) line is @xmath52 , giving an excitation temperature of @xmath53 = @xmath54  k based on the transition probabilities of @xcite and an ortho to para hydrogen ratio of 3 .",
    "this is lower than the general value of @xmath55 k derived from the ro - vibrational h@xmath0  1 - 0 s(1 ) and 2 - 1 s(1 ) line ratios in thermalized molecular shock regions @xcite .",
    "it may be that in the case of 3c  396 the density of the molecular gas is smaller than the critical density for thermalization , so that the excitation temperature is lower .",
    "the dereddened surface brightness of h@xmath0-pk1 is @xmath56 ergs @xmath26 s@xmath2 sr@xmath2 .",
    "this surface brightness can be produced by a c - shock penetrating into a molecular cloud of n@xmath57 = @xmath58 @xmath4 and @xmath59 = 50  100 @xmath9 g with a shock velocity of 2030 km s@xmath2 @xcite . since we are observing tangentially to the shock front in 3c  396",
    ", the real density could be lower than the model value which was calculated for a normal surface brightness .",
    "we detected the [ ]  1.64 @xmath9 m and h@xmath0  2.12 @xmath9 m filaments which are close to each other in the western boundary of 3c  396 .",
    "while the [ ]  filament is curved and distributed along the bright radio emission , the h@xmath0  filament appears to be straight and is located just _ outside _ the bright radio emission .",
    "the [ ]  and h@xmath0  filaments are adjacent in the middle , but are apparently separated at the edges . the former is brighter than the latter .    what would be the origin of these filaments ? in principle , one can observe the emission from both fe@xmath60 ions and h@xmath0  molecules in a single snr shock if the shock is radiative and has swept up enough column density to have reformation of molecules behind the shock ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , in such cases the h@xmath0  emission originates in the downstream , which is opposite to the ` reversal ' of the relative positions between the [ ]  and h@xmath0emission observed in 3c  396 ( figure  [ fig_twocolor ] ) .",
    "interestingly 3c  396 is not the first snr where the ` reversal ' is detected .",
    "it has been detected previously in several snrs , including rcw  103 @xcite , g11.2@xmath60.3 @xcite , and w49b @xcite .",
    "( the ` reversal ' was also observed in w44 @xcite , but it is excluded in our discussion because it is an old snr and also [ ]  emission is fainter than h@xmath0  emission , on the contrary to the other snrs . ) table  [ tab_snrlist ] summarizes the properties of these four snrs ( including 3c  396 ) where we list their distances , radii , and ages , along with their interactions with ambient molecular clouds . for the origin of the ` reversal ' between the near - ir [ ]  and h@xmath0  emission , @xcite considered the excitation of h@xmath0  by ultraviolet or x - rays from a snr , although it appears unlikely because of the difficulty in exciting the cold gas . for w49b , @xcite proposed an explosion inside a wind bubble within a molecular cloud and h@xmath0  emission being produced by a ` jet ' propagating beyond the bubble ; however , it is inadequate to explain all the four snrs .",

    "g11.2@xmath60.3 and rcw  103 are remnants of type iil / b sne that had intermediate - mass ( 2535 @xmath62 ) progenitors with strong red supergiant ( rsg ) winds , and the snr shocks are interacting with the wind material extending to 57  pc .",
    "the radio morphology of 3c  396 , together with the detection of the [ ]  and h@xmath0  filaments , indicates that it may also be a remnant of a type iil / b sn . in the radio emission ( figure  [ fig_rx ] )",
    ", there exists a thick , half ring - like bright radio shell ( brs ) in the western part of the remnant . beyond this brs of @xmath7 25 ( or 6 pc ) radius , there appears faint plateau - like emission especially in the north and south of the remnant .",
    "we interpret this brs as the rsg wind material confined by the ambient pressure and the faint extended plateau - like emission as originating from the snr shock that has crossed the boundary of the wind material .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the size of the brs which is comparable to to the typical size of the rsg wind material confined by the ambient pressure @xcite . in this scenario , the [ ]",
    "emission may trace the shocked material of the rsg wind , while the h@xmath0  emission may represent interactions between the snr shock and a wind blown bubble produced during the main sequence ( ms ) phase of the progenitor star by its fast stellar winds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this also provides a natural explanation of the positional ` reversal ' between the [ ]  and h@xmath0  emission .",
    "the h@xmath0  filament could be either the inner boundary of the ms wind blown bubble or molecular clumps left over inside the bubble .",
    "we note that the 4.5 and 5.8 @xmath9 m emission of 3c  396 detected with @xmath63 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; see   1 ) can also be explained by this scenario .",
    "the @xmath63 4.5  @xmath9 m waveband contains the wavelengths of pure rotational h@xmath0  lines , while the 5.8  @xmath9 m one does those of many atomic lines , including the [ ]  line at 5.34  @xmath9 m .",
    "the 4.5  @xmath9 m emission is located slightly outside of the 5.8  @xmath9 m emission , consistent with what we see in this study with the near - ir h@xmath0  and [ ]  line emission . in conclusion ,",
    "the two - stage snr shock interactions with rsg wind material and also with a ms wind blown bubble appear to explain the near - ir [ ]  and h@xmath0  emission in the young snrs of type iil / b sne , including 3c  396 .",
    "we suggest that the [ ]  emission in 3c  396 represent dense clumps in the rsg wind of the progenitor star as follows .",
    "the expansion velocity of [ ] -pk1 is very small compared to what we expect from a young snr .",
    "if we use the hot gas temperature of 0.62 kev derived from x - ray observations @xcite , the implied velocity of the snr shock in 3c  396 is in fact 600  km s@xmath2 .",
    "this discrepancy indicates that the ambient medium may be inhomogeneous , so that the snr shocks propagating into dense clumps are slow and radiative while the shocks propagating through the diffuse interclump medium are fast and non - radiative . generally in a shocked gas the [ ]  lines",
    "are emitted in the far downstream where hydrogen atoms are mostly neutral at @xmath64@xmath65  k @xcite .",
    "this is because the ionization potential of the fe atom is low ( 7.9 ev ) and the far - ultraviolet photons from hot shocked gas can penetrate far downstream to maintain the ionization state of fe@xmath60 .",

    "3.2.1 gives an upper limit of the density of hydrogen nuclei @xmath66",

    "this indicates that the shock in the [ ]  gas can be driven by the thermal pressure of the hot gas .",

    "the density of the rsg wind at @xmath73 pc is @xmath74  @xmath4 if we use the mass loss rate @xmath75  @xmath62 yr@xmath2 and the wind speed @xmath76  km s@xmath2  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the preshock density of the [ ]  emitting gas is an order of magnitude greater than the mean density of the rsg wind , suggesting that the former represents dense clumps in the rsg wind material .",
    "stars of intermediate - mass ( 2535 m@xmath77 ) have fast winds in the ms phase and slow dense winds during the rsg phase . just before a core - collapse sn explosion ,",
    "therefore , they are surrounded by a dense circumsteller region of 57  pc radius created by the rsg winds embedded within a low - density bubble produced by the ms winds @xcite . once explodes , the sn shock encounters these pre - existing structures to generate in principle a multi - shell structure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the details can differ from case to case depending on the distribution of the interstellar medium . in this paper , based on the detection of the near - ir [ ]  and h@xmath0  filaments ,",
    "we propose that the snr 3c  396 is a remnant of a type iil / b sn that shows such a multi - shell structure produced by the interactions of the snr shocks with the rsg wind material ( i.e. , [ ]  filament ) and also with the ms wind blown bubble ( i.e. , h@xmath0  filament )",
    ". this scenario can provide a natural explanation of the relative locations between the [ ]  and h@xmath0  emission , where the latter is placed farther from the center of the remnant than the former , and is also consistent with the @xmath63 4.5 and 5.8 @xmath9 m emission of 3c  396 .",
    "the [ ]  emission likely represents dense clumps driven by the thermal pressure of hot x - ray emitting gas in the remnant .",
    "we identify that there exists a molecular cloud that appears to surround 3c  396 .",
    "the velocities of the molecular gas are very similar to the systematic velocity of 3c  396 , indicating that this molecular gas may be indeed interacting with 3c  396 to produce the h@xmath0  emission .",
    "further sensitive molecular line observations are needed to investigate this possibility more .",
    "finally , we note that there are three other snrs having [ ]  and h@xmath0  emission somewhat similar to that of 3c  396 .",
    "we expect that these snrs are also remnants of type iil / b sne ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that have comparable environments produced by the stellar winds of similar progenitors .",
    "we would like to thank kristy dyer for providing the vla image of 3c  396 .",
