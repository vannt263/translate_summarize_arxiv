    "both these investigations concluded that differences in the initial structural properties of the fg and sg populations may leave a significant fingerprint in the binary fraction and binding energy distribution of different stellar populations .",
    "specifically , these studies showed that sg binaries , as a consequence of their initial central concentration , are more significantly affected by dynamical processes and predicted that the fraction of sg binaries ( in the moderately hard regime ) should be smaller than that of the fg population . on the observational side , dorazi et al .",

    "finally since the interaction rate of compact binaries is non - negligible only in the cluster innermost regions , the evolution of binary properties is driven also by the timescale on which internal two - body relaxation drives binary segregation towards the cluster centre . here",

    "the hardness parameter allows us to characterize the possible role and evolution of a binary during the dynamical history of a cluster ( see e.g. heggie & hut 2003 ) ; the actual physical properties of a binary corresponding to a given value of the hardness parameter depend on the masses of the binary components , the binary semi - major axis ( or period ) and the velocity dispersion of the cluster .",
