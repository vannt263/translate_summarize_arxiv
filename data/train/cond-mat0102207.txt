    "porous silicon was discovered in the fifties trying to electropolish silicon in hydrofluoric acid @xcite . for low current densities ,",
    "respectively high electrolyte concentrations , silicon is not electropolished but pores are formed .",
    "increasing the current density over a threshold value , which decreases with the electrolyte concentration , results in electropolishing . in the beginning of the nineties",
    "visible luminescence at room temperature was discovered @xcite .",
    "the possibility to produce optoelectronic devices out of porous silicon started enormous research activity .",
    "meanwhile many applications for porous silicon are in development .",
    "most of these applications are based on the morphology of porous silicon , for a review see @xcite .",
    "porous silicon is formed by anodic dissolution of silicon in hydrofluoric acid .",
    "the silicon surface is in contact with the electrolyte , usually in a teflon cell . through the external potential an electric current",
    "is maintained across the cell and flows from the semiconductor to the acid .",
    "defect electrons ( i.e. holes ) from the semiconductor and hf ( or f@xmath0 ions ) from the electrolyte combine at the fluid - semiconductor interface and dissolve silicon through an electrochemical reaction .",
    "the morphology of the unsolved silicon depends on the current . in the electropolishing phase the silicon surface",
    "is etched layer by layer and remains essentially flat , whereas in the porous silicon phase many holes are formed of a size ranging from a few nanometers to microns .",
    "porosities of over 95% relative to crystalline silicon can be reached .    despite its importance",
    ", there is little theoretical understanding of how porous silicon is formed , for a review see @xcite .",
    "even the basic issue why there is a transition from porous silicon formation to electropolishing is unresolved .",
    "the reasons are rather obvious , when one compares with other pattern formation processes like dendrites , viscous fingering , and colloidal aggregation . as in these systems",
    ", we have to understand the dynamics of a moving interface , here between a semiconductor and an acid . at the interface silicon",
    "is dissolved through an electrochemical reaction .",
    "thus in contrast to the better understood systems mentioned above , we have to consider the transport of several species in the presence of an electric field .",
    "moreover , since the species feed back into the electrical field and react with each other , the transport equations become nonlinear .",
    "one approach to model the dissolution process is by a stochastic growth model , i.e. growth of the fluid into the semiconductor , see for example @xcite .",
    "these models are inspired by the diffusion limited aggregation ( dla ) model . while , in principle , such a model is on the atomic scale , because of numerical limitations in practice larger spatial units are used . by suitable adjustments of model parameters structures qualitatively similar to porous silicon",
    "can be produced , but the quantitative connection of model parameters to physical parameters is lost and in some cases the coarsening introduces a new length scale into the system which obscures the physics .    a second approach , starting at much larger length scales , is to use a continuum description for both , the motion of the interface and the ionic and electronic transport , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "these models include a depletion or passivation layer at the interface in a phenomenological way and assume an ad hoc surface tension to stabilize against small perturbations and to provide a length scale which can be compared with the pore formation .",
    "however , surface tension can only affect length scales of the order of the micropore diameter , i.e. nanometers .",
    "the above mentioned models are not valid on these small scales since the mean free path , quantum effects , and the electrical double layer in the electrolyte would have to be taken into account .",
    "we will use here also a description through continuum equations , but take care to model the actual chemistry and kinetics at the interface and the physical transport mechanisms .",
    "this results in a somewhat complicated set of evolution equations and we have to be satisfied with the more modest goal to understand whether continuum equations in general are able to predict the transition from electropolishing to pore formation . as benchmark for the transition we use the dispersion relation as obtained from a linear stability analysis of the flat interface moving at a constant velocity .",
    "if the dispersion switches from unstable to stable , we interpret this as the transition from pore formation to polishing .",
    "of course , if the continuum equations contain the information of the pore structure at all , it will not be unraveled in such a stability analysis .    in section  [ modeling ]",
    "we discuss the full nonlinear transport equations and their boundary conditions at the interface .",
    "we derive a simplified transport model which covers essential features of electrochemical etching of semiconductors and calculate the stability of the dissolution front in linear order in section  [ stabilityanal ] .",
    "our results are summarized in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "while anodizing silicon in hydrofluoric acid , silicon is dissolved in an electrochemical reaction .",
    "the detailed reaction mechanism is still topic of actual research .",
    "however , during pore formation hydrogen evolution is observed whereas no hydrogen is formed during electropolishing .",
    "the valence of the chemical reaction differs in both cases . during pore formation the dissolution steps for",
    "a single silicon atom add up to @xcite @xmath1 for each silicon atom two elementary charges have to reach the interface . for electropolishing",
    "the sum reaction is @xcite @xmath2    in both cases , for pore formation and for electropolishing , the local silicon dissolution rate is proportional to the local electrical current density component normal to the interface , denoted by @xmath3 .",
    "thus the local interface velocity @xmath4 is @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the volume of silicon per unit area dissolved by a unit charge .",
    "this number is inversely proportional to the valence @xmath7 of the chemical reaction , i.e.   the number of unit charges necessary to dissolve one silicon atom .",
    "the valence doubles as the current density is increased over the threshold value for electropolishing @xcite .",
    "the local current density is determined by the transport of reactants and reaction products in the semiconductor and the electrolyte as well as by the reaction kinetics .",
    "modeling the transport and the interface reaction depends strongly on the considered length scale . in n - doped silicon ,",
    "the pore spacing is typically some microns whereas in p - silicon nanometer sized pores are formed .    the shorter the considered length scale the more detailed the model has to be .",
    "the mean free path of charge carriers in the semiconductor is of the order of some ten nanometers .",
    "transport on this length scale can be described by boltzmann equations , but their nonlocality makes them difficult to analyze @xcite .    on the nanometer scale ,",
    "quantum effects start to play a role @xcite and the electrical double layer at the interface in the electrolyte , i.e. the helmholtz layer , has to be taken into account @xcite . at this level ,",
    "details about the electrochemical reaction path way have to be fed into electronic structure calculations to determine the boundary conditions .",
    "such detailed knowledge is not available and the presence of an electrolyte makes the calculations even more complicated .    to avoid these difficulties",
    "we restrict our model to length scales large as compared to the mean free path in the semiconductor , i.e.  larger than 100  nm .",
    "then , the transport in the semiconductor and in the electrolyte can be described by drift and diffusion , i.e.  by nernst - planck equations .",
    "the current density of electrons , @xmath8 , and holes , @xmath9 , is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the diffusion constant , @xmath12 the mobility , @xmath13 the elementary charge , and @xmath14 the electric field .",
    "the electron and hole concentrations @xmath15 and @xmath16 determine the local charge density and thus the electric field via the poisson equation @xmath17 with @xmath18 the density of ionized dopant atoms and @xmath19 the dielectric constant of silicon .",
    "for p - doped silicon @xmath18 is negative and for n - doped silicon positive . since the electric field is determined by the charge carrier concentration , the products @xmath20 and @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ seminernstplanck ] ) represent nonlinearities .",
    "another nonlinearity appears due to production and recombination of electron hole pairs in the continuity equation @xmath22 where @xmath23 the life time of the charge carriers and @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the equilibrium electron and hole concentration , respectively @xcite .",
    "we make the quasistatic approximation neglecting the time derivative of the concentration fields .",
    "this is justified if the relaxation time for any field involved in the dissolution process is much faster than the interface movement .",
    "the electrical charge is conserved due to @xmath26 . the source term in eq .",
    "( [ eleholepair ] ) is derived from a law of mass action for the recombination reaction @xmath27 .",
    "if convection is negligible , the transport of molecules and ions in the electrolyte can be described analogously .",

    "the poisson equation is @xmath45 with the electrolyte s dielectric constant @xmath46 . as in the semiconductor ,",
    "the law of mass action type source terms and the coupling of the ion concentrations to the electric field represent nonlinearities which make the transport equations considerably more complicated as compared to equations used to describe directed solidification or viscous fingering for example @xcite .",
    "moreover , especially in the description of the transport in the electrolyte , there are poorly understood features .",
    "first of all , there are many other ions in the electrolyte that do not take part in the dissolution reaction directly but affect the electric field and the transport properties .",
    "secondly , during pore formation , silicon enters the solution as @xmath47 and reacts to @xmath31 in the solution @xcite . the reaction rate for this process",
    "is not known and it is possible that a considerable amount of @xmath47 is present near the interface in solution .",
    "thirdly , hydrogen bubble evolution is not modeled as well as convection . nevertheless , we propose to proceed with the nonlinear transport equations ( [ seminernstplanck ] ) to ( [ poissoneq ] ) .      at the interface between the semiconductor and the electrolyte , the dissolution reactions eqs .",
    "( [ porereaction ] ) and ( [ polierreaction ] ) have to be taken into account . in both equations , the electric current density component normal to the interface ( denoted by the subscript @xmath48 )",
    "is given by the difference of the forward and backward reaction rate . in a law of mass action type approximation ,",
    "these rates are given by the concentration product of the reactants and the reaction products , respectively .",
    "thus for the pore formation reaction we obtain @xmath49 with the reaction rate @xmath50 .",
    "the parameter @xmath51 is a measure for the equilibrium concentration product for this reaction .",
    "the current density is taken positive for currents flowing from the electrolyte into the semiconductor . for reaction eq .",
    "( [ polierreaction ] ) we obtain correspondingly @xmath52 in both cases , the concentration of crystalline silicon is a constant summarized in the parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "surface tension could be accounted for by a curvature dependence of @xmath54 but can not play a role at the length scales discussed here .",
    "obviously , these boundary conditions are highly nonlinear .",
    "the particle current density components normal to the interface represent the stoichiometry of the corresponding chemical reaction . in case of eq .",
    "( [ porereaction ] ) this is @xmath55 and for eq .",
    "( [ polierreaction ] ) @xmath56 thus the current densities of all species taking part in the reaction are determined by fixing the current density of one of them",
    ". the normal current density component of species which do not take part in the dissolution reaction is zero .",
    "the inner helmholtz layer in the electrolyte is not described by the ion transport equations .",
    "this layer has a very high capacity as compared to the diffuse part of the electrical double layer in the electrolyte and the depletion layer in the semiconductor @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the main potential drop across the interface occurs in the depletion layer in the semiconductor .",
    "thus the electrical potential @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) is continuous at the interface in a first approximation .",
    "for the electric field boundary conditions as known from electrostatics are used , i.e.  the tangential component of @xmath14 and the normal component of @xmath59 are continuous across the interface .",
    "we do not specify the boundary conditions at the cathode or at the backside of the wafer , since no experimental evidence is reported for an influence of the cathode or the wafer backside on the dissolution process .",
    "outside the depletion layer the semiconductor is electrically neutral and can be treated as an ohmic conductor .",
    "the electron and hole concentrations have equilibrium values . in the electrolyte",
    ", there is more variety . due to the consumption of reactants and the accumulation of reaction products ,",
    "the composition of the electrolyte changes in time",
    ". however , usually the electrolyte is stirred . in a large container , this means , that in a certain distance from the anode , the electrolyte is homogeneous , approximately in equilibrium , and has a composition which hardly changes in time .",
    "thus , a reasonable boundary condition for the model equations is to fix the concentration of the electrolyte components at a certain distance from the interface to the equilibrium values .",
    "this distance depends strongly on stirring and the current density and must remain as a free parameter .",
    "such kind of boundary condition is a very crude approximation , since convection certainly plays a role even in the diffusion layer , i.e.  the region near the interface where the electrolyte is not homogeneous due to the applied current . to include convection in the model",
    "is in principle possible . on the scale of the pores convection",
    "should not play a role because of the high viscosity of hydrofluoric acid .",
    "the model described in this section should be reasonably close to the physics and chemistry of the etching process on length scales large compared to the mean free path in the semiconductor .",
    "we have to deal with nonlinear transport equations and boundary conditions .",
    "however , the two cases , i.e.  pore formation and electropolishing , are actually treated as two separate models .",
    "one would like to have a model that decides itself which reaction pathway ( i.e. which law of mass action boundary condition ) to take , depending on concentrations or current densities at the interface .",
    "combining the two boundary conditions eq .",
    "( [ bcpore ] ) and eq .",

    "but the stoichiometry equations ( [ porecurrent ] ) and ( [ policurrent ] ) have to be included too .",
    "for that one needs to know the local fraction of silicon atoms that are dissolved by the pore reaction ( [ porereaction ] ) and the polishing reaction ( [ polierreaction ] ) , respectively .    beside this constraint , analyzing the above developed model ( analytically or numerically ) would be a really demanding venture .",
    "the parameter space is large and even though many parameters have a direct physical interpretation , experimental values are not available to fix them .",
    "our goal is to study the transition from pore formation to electropolishing , in particular to investigate the mechanism that can lead to such a transition .",
    "therefore we study a simplified model that captures key features of the above description of electrochemical dissolution of silicon , namely the interplay of more than one field determining the interface motion , a change of valence of the dissolution reaction , and law of mass action type boundary condition .",

    "the sign change at @xmath168 is accompanied by a reversion of the growth direction whereas at @xmath169 only the stability properties change .",
    "motivated by the discussion of electrochemical etching of silicon in hf solutions we developed a simplified model in sec .",

    ", the semiconductor and the electrolyte is diffusive .",
    "we performed a linear stability analysis of a flat interface for three limiting cases of a simplified model and found two mechanisms that can cause a stabilization of the interface at high current densities .",
    "firstly , a change of valence of the dissolution reaction with current density can stabilize the interface .",
    "the sign of the dispersion relation flips when the change of the valence with current density is large enough , namely if @xmath170 .",
    "this is true in general , independent of the transport mechanisms in the semiconductor and electrolyte , the number of reactants and reaction products , and the type of boundary conditions",
    ". for electrochemical etching of silicon in hydrofluoric acid the change of valence at the transition from pore formation at low current densities to electropolishing at high current densities is large enough .",
    "the stability of the interface at high current densities , after the valence settled at the electropolishing value , can not be explained with this mechanism .",
    "however , there an oxide layer is formed which has to be dissolved chemically . at low current densities , when pores are formed , silicon is dissolved directly .",
    "this oxide layer reduces the diffusivity in the electrolyte considerably , leading to a stabilization of the interface .",
    "our model shows , that an interface propagating into a much more diffusive medium is stable ( given that the reactants are the rate limiting species , not the reaction products ) .    a second mechanism that at least partially stabilizes an interface are nonlinear law of mass action type boundary conditions .",
    "while the sign of the dispersion relation @xmath106 at small @xmath114 is determined by the ratio of diffusion lengths in semiconductor and electrolyte , the value at high @xmath114 as a function of the current density can change sign from positive to negative .",
    "the sign of @xmath106 for small @xmath114 is determined by the ratio of diffusion lengths .",
    "the side with the larger diffusion length @xmath171 , i.e. the larger life time @xmath23 , determines the stability of long wave length perturbations .",
    "if the diffusion length of the semiconductor is much longer than the one of the electrolyte , the interface is unstable for long wavelengths .",
    "if the diffusion length in the electrolyte is much larger , @xmath106 is negative for small @xmath114 .",
    "our analysis shows , that a continuum model of surface growth , i.e. a moving boundary value problem for partial differential equations , can have a transition from linear stability to instability with increasing current density .",
    "the two mechanisms discussed here are particularly interesting from a theoretical point of view in that the effects of nonlinearities in the model equations can still be handled analytically through a linear stability analysis .",
    "it is questionable whether the transition from porous silicon formation to electropolishing can be described by one of the discussed mechanisms alone .",
    "the valence of the dissolution reaction of silicon does change in this transition .",
    "but the implementation in the model of sec .  [ simplmodel ] is oversimplified .",
    "a more realistic model would include two alternative reaction pathways for the species at the interface in the spirit of eq .",
