    "the system has four parameters , viz .",
    ", the spontaneous emission , the quality factor of the cavity , the atom - field coupling strength , and the travel time in the cavity . the observed effects in qed cavities include modifications in the spontaneous emission rates , changes in the atomic energy spectrum , and the continuous matter - field interchange of energy  @xcite .",
    "systems of @xmath4 non - interacting @xmath5-level atoms or molecules confined in a small container compared with the radiation wavelength have been studied within the dicke model . in this model , the dipolar interaction between the atoms and the field",
    "is considered  @xcite .",
    "for the one atom case , the model ( called the jaynes - cummings model ) is exactly soluble with and without the rotating wave approximation ( rwa )  @xcite . for an arbitrary number of @xmath5-level atoms or molecules in the rwa ,",
    "the tavis - cummings ( tc ) model , has been also solved analytically under resonant conditions  @xcite .",
    "the jaynes - cummings ( jc ) hamiltonian takes into account only the reversible coherent evolution , and describes a single @xmath5-level system strongly coupled to one mode electromagnetic field  @xcite .",
    "the energy spectrum consists of an infinite ladder of doublets additionally to the ground state . for a total number of excitations @xmath6 ,",
    "it is found , in resonant conditions , that the splitting of the levels is equal to @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes the atom - field coupling strength , and this allows us to observe the anti - bunching phenomenon .",
    "other nonlinear effects in optics have been observed in the strong coupling regime between multi - level atoms and radiation field , within the electromagnetic induced transparency ( eit ) medium scheme  @xcite .",
    "another example in which it is necessary to consider 3-level atoms is in the area of quantum information theory , for the establishment of a quantum communication protocol in a quantum network  @xcite .",
    "macroscopic superpositions of states appear naturally as symmetry adapted states in the tc and dicke models  @xcite .",
    "since the foundations of quantum mechanics the coherent states have called the attention of the community because they minimise the heisenberg uncertainty relations  @xcite .",
    "later works have considered superpositions of even or odd coherent states  @xcite , and of squeezed states  @xcite , all of them describing non - classical states of light because they have different statistical properties than the coherent states ( which are usually called classical states of light  @xcite ) .",

    "rydberg atoms traveling through a superconducting cavity have led to new experimental tests of quantum theory .",
    "these include the preparation of macroscopic superpositions of field states in a cavity ( called schrdinger cats )  @xcite .",
    "the upper bounds of the relative energy difference of two schrdinger cat states with a fixed fidelity have been also studied in  @xcite , enhancing the importance of quantum information theory .",
    "the purpose of this work is to generate robust superpositions of photon number operator states within the generalised tavis - cummings model ( gtc ) , independently of the dipolar strengths and of the number of atoms .",

    "the stationary states of the gtc model , for the one particle case , are given in analytic form together with the corresponding evolution operator .",

    "we consider a superposition of two states with @xmath13 and @xmath14 values for the total excitation number .",
    "the results for the one - atom case can be extended to any number of atoms , under resonant conditions as well as under detuning .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section  [ sec2 ] we discus the generalisation of the tc model to consider atoms of 3-levels in each of the three configurations @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "for the one - particle case , the dressed states are obtained in analytic form together with their atom - field quantum correlations measured through the calculation of the linear entropy . in section  [ sec3 ]",
    "the evolution operator for the single particle case is determined in analytic form for a given total number of excitations .",
    "this is used to study the behaviour of the light sector for two different initial conditions , which requires the reduced density matrix for the light , and from this the calculation of the husimi function .",
