    "the problem of reaching a consensus among a group of agents using only local interactions has a long history @xcite and in recent years it has received a remarkable attention from different perspectives , such as engineering , computer science , biology , ecology and social sciences @xcite .    till today",
    ", a large number of results have been obtained to solve consensus problem , whose common feature is the focus on cooperative system . in several real world cases , however , it is more reasonable to assume that both collaborative and adversary relationships exist in the multi - agent interactions .",
    "some examples can be found in social network theory , where the multi - agent networks have antagonistic relationships @xcite .",
    "very recently , a bipartite consensus problem is investigated with the help of signed network theory in @xcite , where all agents converge to a value which is the same in modulus but different in sign . though the interaction rule is laplacian - like scheme , but a signed laplacian matrix associated with the antagonistic network has some distinctive spectral properties .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a bipartite consensus for multi - agent systems with antagonistic networks by applying an event - based update strategy .",
    "though some event - triggered consensus controls have been proposed for cooperative multi - agent systems @xcite , however , few results can be found for multi - agent systems with antagonistic interactions . in this paper ,",
    "the bipartite consensus stability of the multi - agent system is analyzed for undirected and directed signed networks , respectively .",
    "simultaneously , a positive lower bound is given for the inter - event times .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follow .",
    "section [ pre ] presents some notations in signed graph theory and formulates a bipartite consensus problem .",
    "then an event - based consensus strategy is proposed to solve the bipartite consensus problem in section [ analysis ] .",
    "some numerical examples are given in section [ simu ] and a summary of the results is concluded in section [ conc ] .",
    "in this section , some basic concepts and notations in the signed graph theory will be firstly introduced .",
    "then , an event - based consensus problem will be formulated for a multi - agent systems with antagonistic interactions .",
    "a signed graph is a triple @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a set of nodes with the indices belonging to a finite index set @xmath2 , @xmath3 is a set of edges , and @xmath4\\in \\mathbb{r}^{n\\times n}$ ] is an adjacency matrix of the weighted graph .",
    "if the edge @xmath5 , then the element @xmath6 of @xmath7 is nonzero .",
    "@xmath8 is called simple if it has no loops or multiple edges .",
    "a ( directed ) path is a sequence of edges in a ( directed ) graph of the form @xmath9 with distinct nodes .",
    "if there is a ( directed ) path between every two distinct nodes , @xmath8 is said to be ( strongly ) connected .",
    "a semipath is defined as a sequence of nodes @xmath10 such that @xmath11 or @xmath12 belongs to the set @xmath13 .",
    "a ( directed ) cycle is a ( directed ) path beginning and ending with the same nodes @xmath14 .",
    "a semicycle is a semipath with identical starting and ending nodes .",
    "for the signed graph @xmath8 , there exists a signal mapping @xmath15 such that the edge set @xmath16 .",
    "the sets of positive and negative edges can be denoted by @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively . in this paper , we assume that the weights between nodes @xmath19 and @xmath20 satisfy @xmath21 . the neighbor index set of node @xmath19 is denoted by @xmath22 .",
    "define the row connectivity matrix and the column connectivity matrix @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "obviously,@xmath26 for undirected graphs . for",
    "directed graphs , if @xmath26 , the directed graph @xmath8 is said to be weight balanced .",
    "the signed laplacian matrix of a directed signed graph @xmath8 is defined as @xmath27 which is an asymmetric matrix generally . for the undirected graph @xmath8 , the signed laplacian matrix is defined analogously",
    ", however , is a symmetric matrix .",
    "a signed graph @xmath8 is said to be ( strongly ) connected if there is a ( directed ) path between every two distinct nodes .",
    "a signed graph @xmath8 is said to be structurally balanced if it admits a bipartition of the nodes @xmath28,@xmath29,where @xmath30 and @xmath31 , such that @xmath32 for @xmath33 and @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "otherwise , it is said structurally unbalanced .",
    "let us consider a group of agents whose dynamics are described by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the state of agent @xmath38 .",
    "assume that the @xmath39 agents are belonging to two hostile groups @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath40 .",
    "thus , it is convenient to describe the interaction network as a structurally balanced signed graph @xmath8 .    in this paper ,",
    "an event - based consensus problem will be considered for multi - agent systems with antagonistic interactions . to be specific ,",
    "all agents update their states only at a series of event - times , which are determined by the measurement errors and the thresholds .",
    "suppose that all agents have the same threshold and there is a sequence of event - times @xmath41 defined for them .",
    "between two consecutive event - times , the interaction rule keeps a constant , i.e. , @xmath42 in the networks with antagonistic links , an interaction law is proposed for agent @xmath38 by @xmath43 , l=0 , 1 , \\cdots.\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is a sign function .",
    "define a concatenation vector @xmath45 .",
    "then the collective dynamics of the @xmath39 agents have a compact form by applying the interaction rule ( [ cont ] ) @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a signed laplacian matrix defined by ( [ siglp ] ) .",
    "define a measurement error @xmath48 for @xmath49 . then the system ( [ comp ] )",
    "is changed to @xmath50      [ lem1 ] if an undirected signed graph @xmath8 is connected and structurally balanced , all eigenvalues of the signed laplacian matrix @xmath47 , defined by ( [ siglp ] ) , are nonnegative , i.e. , @xmath51 .",
    "when the multi - agent network @xmath8 is structurally balanced , all agents can be divided into two subsets @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "define a diagonal matrix @xmath52 such that @xmath53 if @xmath54 and @xmath55 if @xmath56 .",
    "let @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "then the system ( [ compe ] ) can be rewritten as follows @xmath59 where @xmath60 .    according to lemma [ lem1 ] , when the network is undirected , the signed laplacian matrix @xmath47 is a symmetric positive semi - definite matrix .",
    "thus , a candidate iss lyapunov function is chosen for the multi - agent system ( [ compe1 ] ) : @xmath61    the derivative of @xmath62 along the system ( [ compe1 ] ) is : @xmath63 in order to guarantee @xmath64,enforcing @xmath65 to satisfy @xmath66 where @xmath67 .",
    "then we have @xmath68 it is negative for @xmath69 . +",
    "hence the event - trigger condition can be taken as @xmath70    [ thm1 ] consider a multi - agent system @xmath71 with the event - based interaction law ( [ cont ] ) .",
    "assume the undirected graph @xmath8 is connected and structurally balanced .",
    "then all agents achieve average bipartite consensus , i.e. , @xmath72    proof : on the one hand , since @xmath73 , we have @xmath74 . on the other hand ,",
    "since @xmath8 is connected and structurally balanced , @xmath75 will approach to @xmath76 as time goes to infinity .",
    "then it is not difficult to follow that @xmath77 and , furthermore , @xmath78 .",
    "the proof is thus completed .    ' '' ''    the event - based update schedule of the proposed interaction protocol ( [ cont ] ) has a positive lower bound on the inter - event times , which is stated as below without proof :    consider a multi - agent system @xmath71 with the event - based interaction law ( [ cont ] ) . if the graph @xmath8 is connected and structurally balanced .",
    "then the inter - event times @xmath79 are lower bounded by @xmath80      [ lem2 ] if a directed signed graph @xmath8 is strongly connected and structurally balanced , all eigenvalues of the signed laplacian matrix @xmath47 have nonnegative real - parts and @xmath81 is a simple eigenvalue .",
    "take a analogous variable change @xmath57 and @xmath58",
    ". then one has the following closed - loop multi - agent system : @xmath82 let @xmath83 .",
    "one has @xmath84 .",
    "a candidate iss lyapunov function is given as @xmath85 the derivative of @xmath86 is @xmath87 define @xmath88 .",
    "then , @xmath89    in order to guarantee @xmath90 , enforcing @xmath91 to satisfy @xmath92 where @xmath67 .",
    "then we have @xmath93 it is negative for @xmath94 .",
