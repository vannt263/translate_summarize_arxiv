    "recently , important developments have been achieved in single - photon - counting technologies and high - efficient detectors have been developed in several laboratories@xcite .",
    "these improvements allow us to perform challenging experiments in quantum optics , such as device - independent quantum - key distribution@xcite and detection - loophole - free bell tests@xcite .",
    "however , while the system detection efficiency is rapidly increasing , an accurate characterisation method is still not easy to access .",
    "conventionally , calibration of a single - photon detector is obtained by measuring the power of a classical beam with a reference power meter , then the beam is strongly attenuated and sent to the detector under test , dut@xcite .",
    "the accuracy of this method ( usually between 5% and 10% ) is mainly limited by the power stability of the beam , the precision of the attenuation stage and accuracy of the reference power meter .",
    "in particular , the accuracy of the absolute measurement for commercial power meters is large ( @xmath05% ) so a direct calibration traceable to the primary standard is required .",
    "this calibration can only be performed in a metrological laboratory having the primary measurement standard , e.g. the cryogenic substitution radiometer@xcite .",
    "this process is long and time - consuming .",
    "an alternative approach has been developed on the basis of correlated photon pairs@xcite .",
    "it allows us to estimate the detection efficiency of the dut without relying on calibrated devices . in this scheme",
    ", the fraction of emitted photons impinging on the dut has to be determined precisely .",
    "this is challenging due to the many spatial modes involved , particularly for fiber - coupled detectors@xcite .",
    "therefore , the conventional method is still commonly employed .",
    "sanguinetti _ et al._@xcite demonstrated an absolute measurement of classical light at 1540 nm using a radiometer based on an erbium - doped fiber amplifier ( edfa ) .",
    "this radiometer is appealing for two reasons : it can be built with standard optical components and it is suitable for low powers in the range of nw , allowing a weaker attenuation stage .",
    "moreover , when characterising single - photon detectors based on semiconductor materials ( spad ) , non - linearities such as afterpulsing and dead time / hold - off time have to be corrected in order to reduce errors .",
    "time - correlated detection - efficiency measurements@xcite attenuate the impact of these non - linearities at the expense of a more complicated setup .",
    "a simpler but efficient approach is thus welcome .    in this paper",
    "we present a testbench for absolute characterisations of single - photon detectors with high precision .",
    "our setup is based on the conventional method , but we avoid the calibration at the metrological laboratory by using an edfa radiometer that has been built following@xcite . we calibrate the reference power meter with this device and then we verify the calibration factor at the swiss federal office of metrology .",
    "compared to@xcite , the calibration has been performed at a different wavelength ( 1552 nm ) and includes a full error analysis . to improve stability and repeatability ,",
    "we have developed a stable light source of spontaneous emission@xcite .",
    "this source has been demonstrated as a precise reference for metrological applications since it is stable over days , unpolarised and incoherent . as a proof of principle ,",
    "we characterise the efficiency of a spad analysing extensively the uncertainty on the efficiency measurement and compensating the impact of non - linearities . +",
    "this paper aims to provide a rigorous and reliable calibration protocol for characterising the efficiency of a spad .",
    "it is organized as follows : first of all we give an overview of the actual implementation devoting particular attention to the edfa radiometer and the optical source .",
    "then we show how to characterise the uncertainty introduced by each component .",
    "particular attention is given to the calibration of the reference power meter traceable to the edfa radiometer .",
    "finally , we show how to characterise the detection efficiency of a spad .",
    "figure[fig : overview_setup ] shows the testbench we use for the efficiency characterisation .",
    "here we give an overview of the proposed testbench while the implementation is detailed in sec.[sec : setup ] . the beam emitted by the source",
    "is sent with an optical switch , either to the reference power meter ( pm@xmath1 ) or to the dut .",
    "the power in the beam is attenuated in two stages , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , before impinging on the dut . during the measurement pm@xmath1 monitors periodically the beam power . when calibrating pm@xmath1 , the light is also sent to the edfa radiometer .",
    "an appropriate light source is vital for the stability and repeatability of the measurement .",
    "although laser sources have the advantage of well - defined wavelength , the long coherence of the emitted light degrades the repeatability of the calibration because of interreflections that can occur between any couple of semi - reflecting surfaces@xcite .",
    "moreover , polarisation - dependent losses degrade the stability of the entire setup .",
    "commercial incoherent sources are good alternatives , however their power may deviate by more than 2000 ppm after a few hours of measurement@xcite .",
    "another possible alternative is represented by an inverted atomic medium , such as erbium - doped fibre ( edf)@xcite . in this system ,",
    "a strong 982 nm pump laser promotes all the erbium ions in a metastable , excited state .",
    "when an ion decays to its ground level a photon is emitted .",
    "when the emission coming from the edf is dominated by the spontaneous component , the light guided in the fibre is unpolarised and has a short coherence time as it can be deduced by the broad spectrum ( centred at 1530 nm and 48 nm broad ) . moreover , under strong pumping , the output optical power saturates with extremely small variations .",
    "et al._@xcite reported less than 25 ppm of power deviation after 3 days of measurement for a short - length edf .",
    "+ based on their work , we have developed a stand - alone device ( see fig.[fig : sourcepicture ] ) increasing the length of the edf ( er30 - 4/125 by thorlabs ) to @xmath018 cm ( emitted power @xmath4w ) .",
    "the relative allan deviation of the output power shows @xmath520 ppm of deviation after one day of measurement .          as mentioned previously",
    ", the accuracy of the conventional method relies on the accuracy of the reference power meter . when measuring a light beam with an uncalibrated but linear power meter",
    ", the reading will be off by a factor @xmath6 compared to the real value .",
    "absolute optical power measurements can be obtained with the edfa radiometer .",
    "+ like the stable source , this device is based on the edf : the number of output photons per mode @xmath7 exiting from an edf depends on stimulated and spontaneous emission and is described by@xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the number of input photons per mode , and @xmath10 is the gain of the medium .",
    "the term @xmath11 represents the emission stimulated by the input light while the term @xmath12 represents the spontaneous emission . using the formalism of eq.[eq : photonpermode ] , the measured optical powers exiting the fibre when we inject ( @xmath13 ) or not ( @xmath14 ) an input light are given by @xmath15 where h@xmath16 is the photon energy and @xmath17 is the number of modes per second ( @xmath18 is the number of temporal modes and the factor 2 corresponds to the number of polarisation modes ) .",
    "@xmath9 can be derived from eq.[eq : power1],[eq : power2]@xcite : @xmath19 we stress that @xmath9 is an absolute measurement since @xmath20 does not depend on @xmath6 .",
    "the gain @xmath21 can always be deduced independently of @xmath6 using : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the reading of the incoming power .",
    "the @xmath24 dependencies introduced in eq.[eq : muin],[eq : g ] are meant to emphasise that @xmath9 is obtained for each temporal / spectral mode .",
    "following@xcite , we have built the fibred setup shown in fig.[fig : setupradiometer](a ) . the pump light is first injected into the edf using a wdm , then it is removed with another wdm .",
    "we used a counter - propagating pumping configuration to prevent the pump light from exiting at the output of the radiometer .",
    "the input light travels through the two dwms and the edf where it is amplified . at the output",
    "the light is sent either to a spectrometer ( anritsu , ms9710a ) or to a power meter .",
    "two isolators are introduced at the input and output of the device to suppress any back - reflection of the telecom light that can occur outside the radiometer . within the radiometer , back - reflections",
    "are suppressed using apc - connectors .",
    "fiber ( the pump laser fibre).,width=302 ]",
    "to correctly determine the number of incoming photons , the transmission factors before and after the edf have to be carefully measured .",
    "we label the transmission of the input connector as _ t@xmath25 _ , _",
    "t@xmath26 _ is the transmission up to the edf , and _",
    "t@xmath27 _ is the output transmission ( see fig.[fig : setupradiometer ] ) .",
    "the pump laser is off .",
    "when connecting an optical fibre to the power meter , the reading can be affected by a systematic calibration error that can be as high as 10%@xcite . to reduce the impact of this error we employ an integrating sphere photodiode ( thorlabs , s144c ) .",
    "this photodiode , however , has a poor power sensitivity ( @xmath281@xmath29w ) therefore we perform this measurement using a commercial amplified spontaneous emission source ( trillium photonics ) as the input source .",
    "the impact of the statistical errors is reduced by repeating several times the power measurements . to correctly calibrate _",
    "_ we connect and disconnect repeatedly the input fibre into the input connector maximising the transmission each time in order to improve the repeatability@xcite . the uncertainty on _",
    "t@xmath25 _ can be estimated from the statistics of the measured transmission factors .",
    "_ t@xmath26 _ , instead , is calibrated by injecting the light backwards into the radiometer and measuring the light firstly in b , then in a. all the connectors belonging to _ t@xmath26 _ are adjusted to maximise the transmission . in this way",
    ", t@xmath26 is affected only by statistical errors which scale with the square root of the number of acquisitions .",
    "finally , we calibrate @xmath30 by injecting light from the input port and measuring the light in c and then at the output .",
    "again , all the connectors belonging to @xmath30 are adjusted in order to maximise the transmission .",
    "also in this case the uncertainty scales with the square root of the number of acquisitions .",
    "the results are tabulated in tab.[tab : transmissionfactors ] :     * sym.&*value & * rel .",

    "we monitor the light at the output of the radiometer by injecting or not an input beam . in the first case",
    ", the reading of the power meter corresponds to both spontaneous and stimulated emission ( @xmath31 ) , while in the second situation it is only due to the spontaneous component ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the input light is blocked using a@xmath33 ( exfo , fva-3150 equipped with an optical shutter ) .",
    "after having measured the light at the input of the radiometer always with the reference power meter ( @xmath34 ) , we can calculate @xmath10 using @xmath35 and obtaining @xmath36 .",
    "note , in eq.[eq : gaincorrected ] , all powers must be read using the same @xmath6 , so we take care to use the same power - measurement - range setting during the three measurements . for simplicity ,",
    "we introduce @xmath37 corresponding to the average gain over the spectrum of the input light . in the actual measurement",
    "we calculate the gain for each wavelength as described in@xciteand in appendix.[sm : radio ] .      the input power is deduced absolutely , by measuring first the spontaneous emission from the edf ( @xmath14 ) , then all the output light when the input beam is injected into the edf ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "those powers are recorded with a spectrometer ( anritsu , ms9710a ) to recover the dependencies on @xmath24 . with eq.[eq : muin ] we obtain @xmath38 .",
    "we convert this number into optical power ( @xmath39 ) using@xcite @xmath40 where @xmath24 , @xmath41 are given by the spectrometer employed in the measurement . by this measurement",
    "we can calibrate pm@xmath1 .",
    "we define @xmath42 as the ratio between the power measured with the radiometer and the reading of the reference power meter , i.e. @xmath43 .",
    "when calculating the effective amount of light measured with the power meter , one must take into account that a disconnected apc fibre end has an output loss of 3.3% , due to fresnel reflection@xcite .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty on @xmath44 for a single - shot measurement .",
    "we detail the analysis in the appendix[sm : radio ] obtaining 0.6% of relative standard error .",
    "to test the repeatability of the measurement , we repeat the entire characterisation described in sec.[sec : edfa ] three times . the average between the obtained @xmath44s yields 95.2% with a standard deviation of 0.4% .",
    "this is consistent with the uncertainty of the single - shot measurement . as a confirmation ,",
    "the calibration factor of pm@xmath1 has been measured at the swiss federal office of metrology ( metas ) at 1550 nm against a transfer power meter traceable to the cryogenic radiometer . in this case , the absolute - calibration factor is measured at 100@xmath29w yielding k@xmath45=95.3@xmath460.7% .",
    "considering the non - linearity coefficient between 100@xmath29w and 10nw ( measured at 1541 nm with a ge photodiode , k@xmath47=99.754@xmath460.001% ) , k@xmath48 = 95.1@xmath460.7% .",
    "we stress that the measurement with the radiometer was a _ blind _",
    "test since metas characterised the reference power meter only after we have measured @xmath44 .",
    "the two values agree within less than one standard deviation , confirming the potential of the radiometer as a measurement device for the primary standard .",
    "once the reference power meter is calibrated , we proceed in characterising the efficiency measurement setup . here",
    "we describe in details the testbench shown in fig.[fig : overview_setup ] : the light emitted by the source is filtered at @xmath49=1552@xmath461.67 nm ( dicon , tf500 ) .",
    "the beam passes through a@xmath50 ( exfo , fva-3150 ) and goes towards the optical switch ( lightech , lt-210 ) that diverts the light either to pm@xmath1 ( thorlabs , s154c ) or to the dut .",
    "@xmath3 consists of two variable attenuators , a@xmath25,a@xmath26 ( exfo , fva-60b ) .",
    "all the apc connectors have been polished with the same equipment to guarantee the same angle .",
    "the number of incoming photons per second on the detector , @xmath51 , is derived from the measurement of the light power made with pm@xmath1 using @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the power measured by pm@xmath1 , @xmath54j is the photon energy , @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the splitting ratio .",
    "the repeatability and stability of the optical switch and the stability of @xmath3 affect the uncertainty of @xmath51 .",
