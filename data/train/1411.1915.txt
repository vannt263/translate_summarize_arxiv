    "<S> at the end of 19-th century , 1874 , hermann schwartz found that for every point inside a planar disk , a two - dimensional poisson kernel can be written as a ratio of two segments , which he called as the geometric interpretation of that kernel @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> about 90 years later , lars ahlfors , in his textbook , called this ratio as interesting @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we shall see here that every two different points , in a multidimensional space also define a similar ratio of two segments . </S>",
    "<S> the main goal of this paper is to study some integral properties of the ratio as well as introduce and proof one radius theorem for spherical ratio of two points . in particular , we introduce a new integration technique involving the ratio of two segments and a non - trivial integral equivalence leading to an integral relationship between newtonian potential and poisson kernel in any multi - dimensional space . </S>"
