    "almost all liquids , if cooled sufficiently fast , form a glassy structure ; much effort has been directed towards understanding this phenomenon .",

    "theoretical analysis of such models is hampered by an incomplete understanding of the equilibrium ( fluid - solid ) phase transition .",
    "the best studied hard - core model is a system of hard spheres , which has experimental realizations in colloidal , granular and other systems  @xcite . in many cases size dispersion , or other built - in complexity , is introduced in order to avoid crystallization and thereby observe a glass transition  @xcite .",

    "indeed , in the limit of very high spatial dimensionality , there seems to be an ideal glass transition  @xcite , although how far this extends down to lower dimensions is still debated  @xcite .",
    "hard core potentials need not be spherically symmetric . on a lattice , for example , where the symmetry is discrete , the behavior strongly depends on the dimension of the system , the lattice structure , and the exclusion range ( see @xcite and refs . therein ) .",

    "classical linear fluids have been extensively studied over the last decades  @xcite ; the case of elongated rods with orientational freedom has also been analyzed  @xcite .",
    "while the equilibrium properties of this class of models are well understood , their dynamic properties , in particular those related to the glass transition , have received somewhat limited attention  @xcite .",
    "the simple , one - dimensional model considered here , reproduces ( at least in part ) the glassy phenomenology with an explicit ( non - coarse - grained ) microscopic mechanism of facilitation . in analogy with closely related models in which the constraints are kinetic instead of geometric  @xcite , due to a spatial and temporal coarse - graining , here",

    "an exact calculation of the properties of such metastable states , including the equation of state , has been made recently for a toy model  @xcite . in these papers , the ergodicity is explicitly broken , and one assumes that in the glassy phase some transition rates are exactly zero .",
