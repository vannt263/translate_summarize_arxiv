    "in the task of quantum state redistribution , we are interested in the amounts of quantum communication and entanglement that are required to transmit part of the system of one party to another party who possesses some side information about this system .",
    "it is required that all correlations , including those with any external system , are maintained .",
    "more formally , consider two parties alice and bob , with alice initially holding the @xmath0 and @xmath2 registers , and bob holding the @xmath1 register .",
    "the goal is then for alice to transmit the @xmath2 register to bob . if we consider a reference register @xmath3 holding a purification of the @xmath4 systems , then the global state on @xmath7 is uncorrelated with any other external system , and it is sufficient to insure that correlations are maintained across these systems .    in the independent and identical ( iid ) asymptotic version , alice and bob want to perform this task on blocks of @xmath8 identical states , for @xmath8 large , and we are interested in the best asymptotic rates achievable .",
    "luo and devetak  @xcite proved a weak converse theorem in the iid asymptotic regime , stating that the quantum communication rate @xmath9 and the sum of the entanglement consumption rate @xmath10 ( in terms of ebits ) and the quantum communication rate @xmath9 , must be at least @xmath11 subsequently , devetak and yard  @xcite proved that these rates are also achievable and hence characterized the achievable rate region for iid asymptotic quantum state redistribution . in  , @xmath12 $ ] denotes the von neumann entropy , @xmath13 the conditional von neumann entropy , and @xmath14 is the conditional quantum mutual information . note",
    "that since the overall state @xmath15 for quantum state redistribution is pure , we have the symmetry in @xmath0@xmath1 , @xmath16 later , the achievability proofs for quantum state redistribution were significantly simplified by oppenheim  @xcite and independently by ye _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "state redistribution can be seen as the most general bipartite noiseless coding problem , and indeed , other noiseless quantum coding primitives such as schumacher source coding  @xcite , quantum state merging  @xcite ( including fully quantum slepian - wolf  @xcite ) , and quantum state splitting  @xcite can be obtained by considering the case of trivial @xmath17 , @xmath0 or @xmath1 system , respectively .",
    "quantum state redistribution can also be understood as the fully quantum analogue of the tensor power input reverse shannon theorem  @xcite with feedback to the sender and side information at the receiver  @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", there has been some effort on finding meaningful bounds for the one - shot version of these results ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . in the one - shot setting , instead of being interested in iid asymptotic rates , we are interested in the cost of achieving these tasks when only a single copy of the input state is available .",
    "useful bounds are often stated in terms of smooth conditional entropies ( see the theses of renner  @xcite and tomamichel  @xcite , as well as references therein ) .",
    "we are interested in finding bounds for the quantum communication cost of one - shot quantum state redistribution in terms of smooth conditional entropies .    in this paper",
    "we show that it is possible to implement quantum state redistribution for a pure quantum state @xmath18 up to error @xmath19 with quantum communication cost at most @xmath20+o\\big(\\log(1/{\\varepsilon})\\big)\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and a total cost at most @xmath21 where @xmath10 denotes the entanglement consumption in terms of ebits .",
    "note that both the conditional min- and max - entropy terms appearing in   are smoothed , notwithstanding the fact that it is in general unknown how to simultaneously smooth marginals of overlapping quantum systems ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "for the special case of iid states @xmath22 this then allows us to recover the asymptotically optimal rates as in   by means of the fully quantum asymptotic equipartition property for smooth conditional entropies  @xcite .",
    "we also speculate on how to improve the one - shot achievability bound   for the quantum communication cost with the help of embezzling entangled quantum states  @xcite along with some of the ideas in  @xcite .    moreover , we give lower bounds for the quantum communication cost and the entanglement consumption in terms of the smooth conditional min- and max - entropy , and the smooth max - information .",
    "our achievability bounds   and   do match these lower bounds in the asymptotic iid limit . in particular ,",
    "we lift the weak converse for quantum state redistribution from   to a strong converse .",
    "we show that this even remains true when allowing for feedback ( back communication from bob to alice ) .",
    "our achievability bounds originate from the authors manuscripts  @xcite , where  @xcite is partly based on the preliminary results from  @xcite .",
    "independently , the achievability bound   has also been derived by datta _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite ( stated as in preparation in  @xcite ) .",
    "we mention that our bound   has already proven useful for applications in quantum complexity theory .",
    "in particular , based on the idea of quantum information complexity , one of the authors  @xcite was able to derive the first multi - round direct sum theorem in quantum communication complexity .",
    "our converse bounds are based on the authors manuscripts  @xcite , and for sections  [ sec : convent ] and  [ sec : conventint ] also on discussions with leditzky about his work in refs  @xcite : the strong converse property for the sum of entanglement cost and quantum communication cost for state redistribution was proved using the so - called rnyi entropy method by leditzky and datta  @xcite .",
    "this document is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : prel ] , we introduce our notation and give the definitions of the relevant smooth entropy measures .",
    "we then discuss in section  [ sec : decoupling ] the work of oppenheim  @xcite arguing that quantum state redistribution can be optimally decomposed into two applications of quantum state merging .",

    "the idea for the protocol with embezzling states is borrowed from  @xcite , and is the following . at the outset of the protocol , before applying the above protocol as a sub - protocol , we first perform a coherent projective measurement in the eigenbasis of the @xmath2 system , and discard the portion with eigenvalues smaller than @xmath203 .",

    "different amount of ebits are generated and consumed on each branch , hence the need for entanglement embezzling states .",
    "we also transmit the register containing the coherent measurement outcomes , to allow to undo these .",
    "this procedure then flattens the eigenvalue spectra on the @xmath2 system , hence the min- and max - entropies @xmath206 are both equal to the rank of @xmath207 , up to a small error .",

    "this is however not optimal in general , and it is still unclear whether this can be of any help for obtaining tight bounds for state redistribution ( cf .  section  [ sec : conclusion ] ) . an approach that might hold",
    "some promise could be to allow for interaction in the state redistribution protocol .",
    "for example , in a two - message protocol in which bob speaks first , this would then allow bob to also do some preprocessing similar to what alice does here , and possibly allow for improved flattening in the general case .    in the asymptotic iid regime , our bound can be used to prove that a communication at the conditional mutual information is sufficient to achieve exponentially small error .",
