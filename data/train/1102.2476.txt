    "the vela pulsar is the brightest point source in the @xmath0-ray sky .",

    "it radiates multi - waveband pulsed emission from radio to @xmath0-ray which enables us to get considerable insights of the magnetosphere activities .",
    "high energy @xmath0-ray emission takes away a significant fraction of the spin - down luminosity @xcite . the pulsed @xmath0-ray emission from the vela pulsar",
    "was detected by many instruments , e.g. sas 2 @xcite , cos b , the energetic gamma ray experiment telescope ( egret , kanbach et al . 1994 ; fierro et al .",
    "1998 ) , astro - rivelatore gamma a immagini leggero ( agile , pellizzoni et al . 2009 ) and @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-ray profile has two main sharp peaks ( p1 and p2 ) and a third peak ( p3 ) in the bridge .",
    "the location and intensity of p3 as well as the peak ratio ( p1/p2 ) vary with energy @xcite . because of the large @xmath8 , the vela pulsar has a strong wind nebulae , from which the unpulsed @xmath0-ray photons was detected by agile @xcite and @xcite .",
    "theories for non - thermal high energy emission of pulsars are significantly constrained by sensitive @xmath0-ray observations by the telescope .",
    "four physical or geometrical magnetospheric models have previously been proposed to explain pulsed @xmath0-ray emission of pulsars : the polar cap model @xcite in which the emission region is generated near the neutron star surface , the outer gap model @xcite in which the emission region is generated near the light cylinder , the two - pole caustic model or the slot gap model @xcite in which the emission region is generated along the last open field lines , and the annular gap model @xcite in which the emission is generated near the null charge surface .",
    "the distinguishing features of these models are different acceleration region for primary particles and possible mechanisms to radiate high energy photons .",
    "@xcite modeled the @xmath0-ray and radio light curves for the vela pulsar with a larger viewing angle ( @xmath9 ) . in their outer gap model ,",
    "the two @xmath0-ray peaks are generated from the outer gap of one pole , whereas the radio emission is radiated from the other pole .",
    "however , the correlation of high energy x - ray emission and the radio pulse shown by @xcite is not consistent with this picture .",
    "@xcite used the two - pole caustic model to simulate the @xmath0-ray light curve for the vela pulsar , which was further revised by @xcite and @xcite to explain the details of gev light curves .",
    "a bump appears in the bridge in the model for a large inclination angle , but the width and the location of p3 were not well modeled yet .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the @xmath0-ray light curves at differnt bands and spectra of the vela pulsar . in  2 , we introduce the annular gap and core gap , and calculate the acceleration electric field in the annular gap . in  3 , we model the multi - band light curves using the annular gap model together with a core gap .",
    "the radio emission region is identified and the radio lag prior to the first @xmath0-ray peak is explained . to model the vela pulsar spectrum , we also calculate the @xmath0-ray phase - averaged and phase - resolved spectra of both synchro - curvature radiation from the primary particles and sychrotron radiation from the secondary particles .",
    "conclusions and discussions are presented in  4 .",
    "the open field line region of pulsar magnetosphere can be divided into two parts by the critical field lines ( see figure  [ ag - sketch ] ) .",
    "the core region near the magnetic axis is defined by the critical field lines .",
    "the annular region is located between the critical field lines and the last open field lines . for an anti - parallel rotator the radius of the core gap ( @xmath10 ) and the full polar cap region ( @xmath11 )",
    "are @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively @xcite , where @xmath14 is the neutron star radius , @xmath15 is the angular velocity ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the pulsar spin period ) .",
    "the radius of the annular polar region therefore is @xmath18 .",
    "it is larger for pulsars with smaller spin periods .",
    "the annular acceleration region is negligible for older long period pulsars , but very important for pulsars with a small period , e.g. , millisecond pulsars and young pulsars .",
    "it extends from the pulsar surface to the null charge surface or even beyond it ( see figure  [ ag - sketch ] ) .",
    "the annular gap has a sufficient thickness of trans - field lines and a wide altitude range for particle acceleration . in the annular gap model ,",
    "the high energy emission is generated in the vicinity of the null charge surface @xcite .",
    "this leads to a fan - beam @xmath0-ray emission @xcite .",
    "the radiation from both the core gap and the annular gap can be observed by one observer @xcite if the inclination angle and the viewing angle are suitable .",
    "the charged particles can not co - rotate with a neutron star near the light cylinder and must escape from the magnetosphere .",
    "if particles escape near the light cylinder , these particles have to be generated and move out from the inner region to the outer region .",
    "this dynamic process is always taking place , and a huge acceleration electric field exists in the magnetosphere . to keep the whole system charge - free",
    ", the neutron star surface must supply the charged particles to the magnetosphere .",
    "the annular gap and the core gap have particles with opposite sign flowing , which can lead to the circuit closure in the whole magnetosphere .",
    "the potential along the closed field lines and the critical field lines are different @xcite .",
    "the parallel electric fields ( @xmath19 ) in the annular gap and core gap regions are opposite , as has been discussed by @xcite . as a result",
    ", @xmath19 vanishes at the boundary ( i.e. the critical field lines ) between the annular and the core regions and also along the closed field lines .",
    "the positive and the negative charges are accelerated from the core and the annular regions , respectively .    we now consider a tiny magnetic tube in the annular gap region .",
    "we assume that the particles flow out at a radial distance about @xmath20  km , and that the charge density of flowing - out particles @xmath21 is equal to the local goldreich - julian ( gj ) charge density @xmath22 @xcite at a radial distance of @xmath23 . for any heights @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "the acceleration electric field therefore exists along the field line , and can not vanish until approaching the height of @xmath23 .    for a static dipole magnetic field , the field components can be described as @xmath26 and @xmath27 , here @xmath28 is the zenith angle in magnetic field coordinate , and @xmath29 is the surface magnetic field .",
    "thus the magnetic field at a height @xmath30 is @xmath31 . in the co - rotating frame ,",
    "poisson s equation is @xmath32 because of the conservation laws of the particle number and magnetic flux in the magnetic flux tube , the difference between the flowing charge density and local gj charge density at the radius @xmath30 can be written as @xmath33 where @xmath16 is the angular velocity , @xmath17 is the rotation period , and @xmath34 ( and @xmath35 ) are the angle between the rotational axis and the @xmath36 field direction at @xmath30 ( and @xmath37 ) .",
    "wang et al . ( 2006 ) found @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the azimuthal angle and the tangent angle ( half beam angle ) in the magnetic field coordinate , respectively . combining equations ( [ pos ] ) , ( [ rho ] ) and ( [ zet ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath41 substituting @xmath42 and @xmath43 into equations ( [ zet ] ) and ( [ eee ] ) , we can solve the equation for @xmath44 , and calculate the electric field @xmath19 along a magnetic filed line for @xmath45 , as shown in figure [ acc ] for the vela pulsar .",
    "the electric field is huge in the inner region of annular gap and drops quickly when @xmath46 .",
    "we reprocessed the data to obtain the multi - band light curves in the following steps : ( 1 ) limited by the timing solution for the vela pulsar from the fermi science support center ( fssc ) , we reprocessed the original data observed from 2008 august 4 to 2009 july 2 .",

    "( 3 ) as done by @xcite , we used  fselect \" to select photons of energy @xmath51 within an angle of @xmath52 $ ] degrees from the pulsar position .",
    "( 4 ) using the tempo2 @xcite with the plug - in , we obtained the rotational phase for each photon .",
    "( 5 ) finally we obtained the multi - band @xmath0-ray light curves with 256 bins , as presented in figure [ glc ] ( red solid lines ) .",
    "two sharp peaks have a phase separation of @xmath53 . the ratio of p2/p1 increases with energy .",
    "a third broad peak appears in the bridge emission .",
    "the intensity and phase location of p3 vary with energy .",
    "these observed features challenge all current high energy emission models . a convincing model with reasonable input parameters for magnetic inclination angle @xmath54 and viewing angle",
    "@xmath34 should produce multi - band light curves of the vela pulsar and explain the energy - dependent location of p3 as well as the ratio of p2/p1 .",
    "model parameters for both the annular gap and core gap of the vela pulsar should be adjusted for the particle acceleration regions where the @xmath0-ray emission are generated .",
    "the framework of the annular gap model as well as the coordinate details have been presented in @xcite , which can be used for simulation of the multi - band @xmath0-ray light curves of the vela pulsar . in this paper",
    ", we added the simulations for the core gap to explain p3 and bridge emission .",
    "we adopted the inclination angle of @xmath55 and the viewing angle @xmath56 which were obtained from the x - ray torus fitting @xcite .",
    "the modeling was done as follows .",
    "we first separate the polar cap region into the annular and core gap regions by the critical field line .",

    "\\2 . rather following the conventional assumption of the uniform emissivity along an open field line when modeling the light curves @xcite , for both the annular gap and the core gap , we assume that the @xmath0-ray emissivities @xmath73 along one open field line have a gaussian distribution , i.e. , @xmath74 } , \\label{lgs}\\ ] ] here @xmath75 is the magnetic colatitude of a spot on a field line , @xmath59 is the magnetic azimuthal of this field line , @xmath76 is the arc length of the emission point on each field line counted from the pulsar center",

    "the phase - resolved spectra for both high - energy p3 and low - energy p3 can be explained in the synchro - curvature radiation from primary particles from the core gap , with little contribution from the synchrotron radiation of secondary particles because they in general have small pitch angles with respect to field lines and large curvature radius .",

    "the bump at a low height for high energy @xmath0-ray ( e.g. @xmath1438 gev ) due mainly to the small curvature radius and large acceleration electric field there . in section 3.1",
    ", we roughly took a gaussian distribution along the arc ( equation [ lgs ] ) to decribe the emissivity near the peak emission region , which is natural in our annular gap model and independent of the model paranmeters .",
    "the detailed features of @xmath0-ray pulsed emission of the vela pulsar observed by provide challenge to current emission models for pulsars .    the charged particles can not co - rotate with a neutron star near the light cylinder , and must flow out from the magnetosphere . to keep the whole system charge - free , the neutron star surface must have the charged particles flowing into the magnetosphere .",
    "we found that the acceleration electric field @xmath135 in a pulsar magnetosphere is strongly correlated with the gj density @xmath144 near the light cylinder radius @xmath78 , while @xmath144 at @xmath145 is proportional to the local magnetic field @xmath146 .",
