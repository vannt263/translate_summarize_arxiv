    "geomaterials display very interesting nonlinear features , diverse aspects of which have been investigated over a long period of time for a recent overview see , e.g. , _ ostrovksy and johnson _ ,  2001 and references therein ] .",
    "a standard technique used to study these nonlinear features is the resonant bar experiment [ _ clark _ , 1966 ; _ jaeger and cook _ , 1979 ; _ carmichael _ , 1984 ; _ bourbie et al .",
    "_ , 1987 ] . in these experiments a long rod of the material under test",
    "is driven longitudinally and its amplitude and frequency response monitored . for a _ linear _ material",
    "the resonance frequency of the rod is invariant over a very wide range of dynamical strain .",
    "an example of this behavior is shown in the results from one of our experiments on acrylic in the top panel of figure  [ fig : rc ] : increasing the strain up to @xmath4 leaves the resonance frequency unchanged ( note that the @xmath5-axis shows the change in the resonance frequency , @xmath6 , and not the resonance frequency itself . )",
    "the resonance frequency of a rod made from a _ nonlinear _ material such as berea sandstone behaves quite differently : when a driving force is applied to the rod , the frequency either increases or decreases ( the modulus either hardens or softens ) depending on the precise properties of the material .",
    "this phenomenon is well - known and a theoretical description based on quasiequilibrium thermodynamics and nonlinear elasticity has existed for a long time [ see e.g. , _ landau and lifshitz _ , 1998 ] ; we will refer to this as the classical theory of nonlinear elasticity or simply as landau theory .",
    "many geomaterials , such as sandstones , belong to the general class of nonlinear materials .",
    "the second and third panel in figure  [ fig : rc ] display resonant bar results for two representative samples , berea and fontainebleau . in both cases",
    "the shift in the resonance frequency is very large and the resonance frequency decreases with drive amplitude .",
    "the strength of the nonlinear response in these materials is very large , orders of magnitude more than for metals .",
    "consequently , it is important to check whether landau theory still applies to these materials , and , if so , over what range of strains .",
    "it is widely believed that geomaterials behave differently than weakly nonlinear materials because of their complex internal structure .",
    "they are formed by an assembly of more or less rigid `` grains '' connected via a much softer `` bond '' network of varying porosity .",
    "the grains make up a large fraction of the volume , between 80 and 99% .",
    "individual grains can be very pure ( as in the case of fontainebleau , @xmath7 quartz ) or made up from several different components ( as in the case of berea : 85% quartz , 8% feldspar , plus small quantities of other minerals ) .",
    "most of these materials are quite porous and their behavior changes dramatically under the influence of environmental effects , such as temperature [ see e.g. _ sheriff _ , 1978 ] or humidity [ see e.g. , _ gordon and davis _ , 1968 ; _ ohara _ , 1985 ; _ zinszner et al .",
    "_ , 1997 ; _ van den abeele et al .",
    "_ , 2002 ] .",
    "this sensitivity to the environment makes controlled studies difficult , as the experiments must be carried out in such a way that these effects are demonstrably under control .",
    "another difficulty in measuring the frequency response of sandstones arises from the brittleness of rocks .",
    "if the samples are driven too hard , microcracks can be induced and the resulting behavior of the material can change dramatically .",
    "in addition , driving can also induce long - lived nonequilibrium macrostates that relax back over a long period of time ( @xmath8 hours ) .",
    "thus , it is important to ensure  by repeating a given drive protocol on the same sample and verifying that the material response does not change from one experiment to the next  that the samples have not been altered from their original condition and the environment is unchanged over the set of observations .",
    "the experiments described in this paper were carried out in this way .",
    "furthermore , the very low strain values ensured that sample damage rarely occurred .",
    "one goal of this work is to clarify , using new and existing data , conflicting observations in the literature , and to present a description of the `` state of the art '' at low strain amplitudes .",
    "here we restrict ourselves mainly to the question of dynamic nonlinearity and do not take up the equally important question of the nature of loss mechanisms and their connection and interaction with the nonlinear ( compliant ) behavior underlying the frequency shift .    in the past ,",
    "several different groups have carried out resonant bar experiments .",
    "_ gordon and davis _  [ 1968 ] investigated a large suite of crystalline rocks , including quartzite , granite , and olivine basalt , at strains between @xmath9 .",
    "their main objective was to measure the loss factor @xmath10 ( or the internal friction @xmath11 in their terminology ) as a function of strain and the ratio of stress and strain . in order to cover the large strain range they divided their experiments in two components : for @xmath12 they used the driven frequency method , driving the rocks at very high frequencies , and for @xmath13 they made direct measurements of the stress - strain curve .",
    "their main findings are the following .",
    "( i ) the loss factor is quite insensitive to the strain amplitude , diverging from a constant value only at high strains . at these high strains",
    "they conclude that this increase in @xmath10 is the result of internal damage .",
    "( ii ) @xmath10 is highly structure sensitive , i.e. , it is sensitive to the details of the microstructure of the rock .",
    "( iii ) @xmath10 increases as the temperature increases .",
    "they conclude that this increase is due to grain - interface displacement , and therefore alteration of the internal structure of the rock .",
    "( iv ) at large strains they find static hysteresis with end - point memory .",
    "following up on _ gordon and davis _ [ 1968 ] , _ mckavanagh and stacey _ [ 1974 ] and _ brennan and stacey _ [ 1977 ] performed another set of stress - strain loop measurements on granite , basalt , sandstone , and concrete .",
    "their main objective was the measurement of stress - strain loops below strain amplitudes of @xmath14 , since _ gordon and davis _ [ 1968 ] had reported that @xmath10 above this limit was no longer a linear function of the applied strain .",
    "_ mckavanagh and stacey _ [ 1974 ] were able to go down to strains of @xmath15 .",
    "( note that this level is still _ above _ the strain at which we found nonequilibrium effects to be important , _ tencate et al . _",
    "[ 2004 ] . ) at these strains they found that the hysteresis loops for sandstone were always cusped at the ends .",
    "another interesting result was that below a certain strain amplitude the shape of the loop became independent of the applied strain amplitude . from this",
    "they concluded that even at the very smallest strain amplitudes , cusps should continue to be present in stress - strain loops .",
    "( however , _ brennan and stacey _ [ 1977 ] noted that for granite and basalt , the stress - strain loops do become elliptical for strains lower than @xmath15 . ) in view of our recent results [ _ tencate et al .",
    "_ , 2004 ] this conclusion might have been drawn without having enough evidence at low enough strain amplitudes .",
    "we return to this point later in section  [ stressstrainloop ] .",
    "_ winkler et al . _  [ 1979 ] conducted experiments with massilon and berea sandstone at strain amplitudes between 10@xmath16 and 10@xmath17 .",
    "the main goal was to determine the strains at which seismic energy losses caused by grain boundary friction become important but softening of the resonance frequency with strain amplitude was also investigated .",
    "they concluded that the losses are only important at strains larger than were investigated .",
    "additionally , they found that the two sandstones investigated displayed nonlinear features dependent on several external parameters , such as water content or confining pressure .",
    "they find that the loss factor is independent of strain below strains of @xmath18 while at relative large strain ( @xmath19 ) there is a clear increase , in agreement with _ gordon and davis _ [ 1968 ] .",
    "the main drawback of the experiments by _ winkler et al . _ [ 1979 ] is the relative lack of data points , especially in the very low strain regime ; the quality of the repeatability of their measurements on the same sample is also not shown . in this respect ,",
    "our work significantly improves on previous results ; we increase the number of measurement points in the low strain regime by a factor of five in comparison to _ winkler et al . _",
    "[ 1979 ] , allowing a more robust analysis of the data .    more recently , _",
    "guyer et al . _",
    "[ 1999 ] and _ smith and tencate _  [ 2000 ] analyzed a set of resonant bar experiments with berea sandstone samples also at low strains .",
    "the conclusions they reached , however , were in strong disagreement with the older results of , e.g. , _",
    "winkler et al . _",
    "[ 1979 ] . instead of the expected quadratic behavior of the frequency shift with drive at very low strains",
    " an essential prediction of landau theory  they reported an ostensibly _ linear _ dependence , claimed to hold down to the smallest strains .",
    "we note that such a linear softening in several material samples was also reported in _ johnson and rasolofosaon _ [ 1996 ] ( see also references therein ) , albeit at significantly higher strains .",
    "this surprising behavior was claimed to be consistent with predictions of a phenomenological model originally developed to explain ( static ) hysteretic behavior in geomaterials at very high strains [ the preisach - mayergoyz space ( pm space ) model ] . in this model a rock sample is described in terms of an ensemble of mesoscale hysteretic units [ _ mccall and guyer _ , 1994 ; _ guyer et al .",
    "_ , 1997 ] . by applying the pm space model to low - strain regimes ,",
    "a linear dependence of the frequency shift with drive can be obtained . by its very nature",
    ", the model also predicts the existence of cusps in low - amplitude stress - strain loops . as discussed in section  [ stressstrainloop ] , however , we do not detect cusps in stress - strain loops at low strains .",
    "motivated partly by these very different findings on similar sandstones and with similar experimental set - ups , we embarked on a set of well - characterized resonant - bar experiments using fontainebleau and berea sandstone samples _ tencate et al . _  [ 2004 ] .",
    "broadly speaking , our findings for the resonance frequency shift confirm the original results of _ winkler et al .",
    "_  [ 1979 ] ; below a certain strain threshold @xmath3 both sandstones displayed the expected quadratic behavior .",
    "in addition , we were able to show that previous claims of a linear shift at high strains are actually an artifact due to the material conditioning mentioned above at strains higher than @xmath3 , and that a simple macroscopic duffing model provides an excellent mathematical description of the experimental data without going beyond landau theory ( as pm - space models explicitly do , by adding nonanalytic terms to the internal energy expansion ) .",
    "thus , we established that , to the extent macro - reversibility holds , the predictions of classical theory are in fact correct .    in this paper",
    "we extend our previous analysis by adding an investigation of energy loss ( via the resonator quality factor @xmath20 ) , dynamical stress - strain loops , and harmonic generation .",
    "we carry out the same experiment several times with the same sample to demonstrate environmental control and repeatability .",
    "the data analysis is based on a gaussian process model to avoid biasing from nonoptimal fitting procedures applied to experimental data . the duffing model introduced in our previous work",
    "is shown to be nicely consistent with the newer results .",
    "the predictions of this model for the quality factor , the frequency shift , and hysteresis cusps ( null prediction ) all hold within experimental error at strains below @xmath3 . at higher strains ,",
    "this simple model breaks down  as it must  due to the ( deliberate ) exclusion of nonequilibrium effects .",
    "finally , we have reanalyzed a subset of the data which were taken in 1999 [ _ smith and tencate _ ,  2000 ] and had led to very different conclusions for berea samples .",
    "we show that the interpretation of the data in the earlier papers was incorrect and demonstrate that the experimental data are actually in good agreement with our present findings [ this paper and _ tencate et al . _ ,",
    "2004 ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in section  [ section : experiments ] we describe the experimental set - up in some detail .",
    "next , in section  [ section3 ] we explain how we analyze the data , especially how we determine the peaks of the resonance curves and how our procedure allows us to determine realistic error bars . in section  [ expres ]",
    "we discuss the results from the experiments .",
    "a simple theoretical model that describes the experimental results is presented in section  [ section : model ] .",
    "we confront previous findings in very similar experiments with our new results in section  [ section : old ] and conclude in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the samples used in the experiments are thin cores of fontainebleau and berea sandstone , 2.5  cm in diameter and 35  cm long .",
    "as established by x - ray diffraction measurements , the fontainebleau sandstone is almost pure quartz ( @xmath2199% with trace amounts of other materials ) ; berea sandstone is less pure having only 85@xmath228% quartz with 8@xmath221% feldspar and 5@xmath221% kaolinite and approximately 2% other constituents .",
    "fontainebleau sandstone has grain sizes of around 150  @xmath23 and a porosity of @xmath24  24% .",
    "berea sandstone samples have grain sizes which are somewhat smaller , @xmath24  100  @xmath23 , with a porosity of about 20% .",
    "a small bruel&kjr  4374 accelerometer is carefully bonded to one end of each core sample with a cyanoacrylate glue ( superglue gel , duro ) .",
    "the accelerometers are an industry standard , and are well characterized . with perfect bonding between accelerometer and rock , the accelerometer  and the associated b&k 2635 charge amp  has a flat frequency and phase response to 25  khz . with poor bonds , the upper frequency limit of the flat response drops .",
    "thus , great care is taken to establish a good bond between accelerometer and sample .",
    "each accelerometer is first qualitatively tested ( i.e. , finger pressure ) to be sure of a strong bond .",
    "furthermore , before the samples are placed in the environmental isolation chamber ( discussed below ) for measurements , a comparison of the accelerometer response with a laser vibrometer ( polytec ) is made and accelerometers are rebonded if the frequency responses differed noticeably . in any case , it is important to point out that for the samples used in this study , all of the resonance frequencies are below 3  khz , nearly an order of magnitude below the upper frequency flat response limit for the accelerometer / charge amp combination .",
    "the source excitation is provided by a 0.75  cm thick piezoelectric disk epoxied ( stycast  1266 ) to the other end of the sample core and backed with an epoxied high impedance backload ( brass ) to ensure that most of the acoustic energy couples into the rock sample instead of the surrounding environment .",
    "resonances in the backload ( @xmath2550 khz ) are much higher than the frequencies and resonances of the sample and thus are not excited in our experiments .        for all the experiments described here , the lowest order longitudinal mode ( the first pochhammer mode ) is excited .",
    "( we note that the mass of the brass backload lowers the center frequencies of the pochhammer mode resonances somewhat but does not affect the shape of a resonance curve . )",
    "resonance curves are easy to measure and analyze and fairly high strains can be attained without requiring a high - power amplifier ( with its frequently accompanying nonlinearities ) . for the fontainebleau sandstone",
    "the lowest resonance frequency is around 1.1  khz ; for the berea sandstone the lowest resonance frequency is around 2.8  khz . measured values for the quality factor @xmath20 of these resonances are about 130 for the fontainebleau sandstone sample and about 65 for the berea sandstone sample .",
    "the lowest order pochhammer mode has both compressional and shear components but the motion is nevertheless quasi - one - dimensional and the bulk of the sample participates in the wave motion associated with the resonance .",
    "as higher - order pochhammer modes begin to resemble surface waves , only the very lowest frequency modes are examined here .",
    "the samples are suspended at two points with loops of synthetic fiber ( dental floss ) or thin o - rings .",
    "different suspension points slightly alter the lowest pochhammer mode resonance frequencies but these differences are much smaller than differences caused by even slight changes of temperature ; moreover , and perhaps more importantly , once the bar is mounted , the resonance frequencies do _ not _ change with increasing drive levels when tested with a standard ( an acrylic bar ) .",
    "suspended in this way ( stress - free ends ) the sample s lowest pochhammer resonance frequency corresponds to roughly a half - wavelength in the sample",
    ".    since most rocks are extremely sensitive to temperature and temperature _ changes _ [ _ ide _ , 1937 ]  with relaxation times of several hours  we have built a sample chamber for effective environmental isolation .",
    "an inner 3/4-inch - wall plexiglass box with caulked seams holds both the samples which are suspended from the top of the box .",
    "air - tight electrical feedthroughs are available for driver and accelerometer connections .",
    "the entire chamber is flushed with n@xmath26 gas and then placed inside another ( larger ) plexiglass box and surrounded with fiberglass insulation and sealed .",
    "the inner sample chamber also sits on top of gel pads for vibration isolation .",
    "the complete isolation chamber is placed in a room whose temperature is controlled with a thermostat and typically varies by no more than 3 degrees c. measured resonance frequencies of samples in this box have been stable to within 0.1  hz .",
    "to get the most precise measurements possible , we use an hp  3325b frequency synthesizer with a crystal oven for frequency stability as the signal source .",
    "the signal from the hp  3325b is fed into the reference input of an eg&g 5301a lock - in amplifier which compares that reference signal with the measured signal from the accelerometer via a b&k  2635 charge amplifier .",
    "the whole experiment , including data acquisition , is computer controlled via labview and a gpib bus . to drive the source ,",
    "the signal from the hp frequency synthesizer is fed into a crown studio reference i amplifier and matched to the ( purely capacitive ) piezoelectric transducer via a carefully constructed and tested linear matching transformer .",
    "to test all the electronics for linearity , we have constructed several known linear sample standards of nearly identical geometry to the rock samples .",
    "the density , sound speed , and @xmath20 s of the samples are chosen such that the mechanical impedances @xmath27 are similar to those of the rock samples .",
    "these `` standard '' samples are driven with identical source / backloads and at levels similar to those experienced by the rock samples .",
    "no nonlinearities have been seen ; results for an acrylic rod are shown in figure  1 .    with the present isolation system ,",
    "we have verified long - term frequency stability of the samples to @xmath22 0.1 hz ( corresponding to a long - term thermal stability inside the chamber of 10  mk ) , which is close to how well the peak of the frequency response curve can be determined at the lowest levels of strain shown in this paper . to test the sensitivity of the lock - in amplifier and assembled apparatus ,",
    "we have measured a resonance curve on the fontainebleau sample at an extremely low drive level .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig : exp ] .",
    "the acceleration measured by the accelerometer has been converted to strain ( the open circles ) using the driving frequency @xmath28 via @xmath29 following the convention in _ tencate et al . _  [ 2004 ] . even though the peak strain near the resonance frequency is only about 1.6 @xmath30 ,",
    "the shape of the resonance curve is clear with only minimal noise obscuration : a lorentzian curve is an extremely good fit to the data as shown by the solid line .",
    "( error bars are not shown for clarity . ) with computer control and long - term temperature stability due to the isolation chamber , this experimental setup permits long enough times to take data over a large  and an order of magnitude lower  range of strains not studied previously .",
    "the basic quantities measured in a resonance experiment are the frequency @xmath28 and the accelerometer voltage @xmath31 , which is automatically converted into acceleration @xmath32 .",
    "it is convenient to translate the acceleration to a strain variable in order to make the comparison of different samples with different lengths easier .",
    "as stated earlier , we employ the convention @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the length of the bar .",
    "these measurements lead to resonance curves as shown e.g. , in figure  [ fig : rc ] .",
    "the task now is to determine the peaks of the resonance curves , tracking the shift of the resonance frequency as a function of the strain as displayed in figure  [ fig : allrange_shift ] .     as a function of the effective strain @xmath35 for the three samples shown in figure  [ fig : rc ] .",
    ", width=264,height=207 ]    in the past , different methods have been suggested to analyze data from low - strain resonant bar experiments [ earlier attempts include _ guyer et al .",
    "_ ,  1999 ; _ smith and tencate _ ,  2000 ] .",
    "in this paper we use a statistical analysis based on a nonparametric gaussian process to model the strain @xmath35 as a function of the driving frequency @xmath28 .",
    "the flexibility of the gaussian process model for strain allows for estimation of the resonance frequency and resulting strain @xmath36 without assuming a parametric form for the dependence of strain on driving frequency .",
    "drawbacks of using a parametric model can include understated uncertainties regarding resonance quantities @xmath36 and excessive sensitivity to measurements far away from the actual resonance frequency .",
    "the nonparametric modeling approach avoids both of these possible pitfalls .    for a given experiment , observations @xmath37",

    "is modeled as a smooth function of frequency plus white noise @xmath38 : @xmath39 where the smooth function @xmath40 is modeled as a gaussian process and each @xmath41 is modeled as an independent @xmath42 deviate . the gaussian process model for @xmath40",

    "the resulting analysis gives a posterior distribution for the unknown function @xmath40 which we take to be the resonance curve .",
    "this posterior distribution quantifies the updated uncertainty about @xmath40 given the experimental observations .",

    "we use the posterior mean as point estimates for @xmath51 and @xmath53 . later in the paper we use error bars that connect the 5th and the 95th percentiles of the posterior samples to quantify the uncertainty in our estimates .",
    "we have recently established the existence of two strain regimes [ _ tencate et al .",
    "_ ,  2004 ] .",
    "as mentioned earlier , in the first regime ( strains below @xmath3 ) the material displays a _",

    "the resonance frequency is determined and used as a reference frequency @xmath54 for the following procedure .",

    "the difference between the two values for @xmath6 at the lowest strain demonstrates the effect of conditioning.,width=264,height=207 ]    the existence of the two regimes delineated by @xmath3 is crucial to understanding and interpreting the dynamical behavior of geomaterials .",
    "although it is possible to describe the nonlinearity of the material at strains below @xmath3 with classical theory [ _ landau and lifshitz _ ,  1998 ] , above @xmath3 the experimental results are complicated by conditioning effects due to the nonequilibrium dynamics of the rock .",
    "disentangling the intrinsic nonlinearity of the material and these nonequilibrium effects is very difficult and the frequency shifts in dynamical experiments at strains above @xmath3 do not have a simple interpretation . in particular",
    ", classical elasticity theory assumes thermodynamic reversibility and therefore can not be applied in this essentially nonequilibrium situation . by the same token , _ classical theory can not be tested by experiments carried out in this regime_. as discussed in the introduction , previous experimental data were interpretated without properly taking the existence of these different regimes into account [ e.g. ,  _ guyer and johnson _ ,  1999 ] .",
    "this , along with incorrect analysis of the experimental data ( see the discussion below ) , led to claiming evidence for nonclassical behavior where in fact none existed .",

    "the strain range shown on the @xmath5-axis in this plot is @xmath60 to 5@xmath57 as explained in the text .",
    "the three different curves gtj show are from different measurements and in all cases the dynamic range is very small .",
    "consider now the lowest  and longest  of these curves , the strain range here is only 10@xmath146 to @xmath147 . a linear fit for this data set might naively appear to be justified , even though the data points at the higher strains are already falling off a linear fit .",

    "the black line shows the quadratic fit obtained from the duffing model , the red line shows the best linear fit including data points only to the right of the dashed line .",
    "inclusion of all data points for the linear fit makes the fit much worse.,width=264,height=207 ]    to emphasize the importance of having sufficient dynamic range , we return to figure  [ fig : old](b ) and consider only the lowest strain measurement data set , shown in detail in figure  [ fig : oldfit](a ) .",
    "the dashed line marks the strain corresponding to the lowest strain in gtj in their longest strain range measurement .",
    "we show in red the best linear fit to all the data points on the right of this line .",
    "the highest strain in gtj was @xmath147 so would only include 4 of the data points in figure  [ fig : oldfit](a ) .",
    "if we only concentrate on the strain regime to the right of the dashed line , both fits , linear and quadratic are acceptable .",
    "but if we consider all the available data points down to the lowest strain , the linear fit fails by being too high .",
    "therefore , in order to make a definite statement about the best fit to the data it is clearly important to have a sufficient range in strain .",
    "it is not possible to obtain uncontaminated measurements at higher strains as discussed in detail earlier , hence extension of dynamic range requires measurements at low strains , as carried out in the present work .",
    "we demonstrate the usefulness of this in figure  [ fig : oldfit](b ) where we show once again the new berea measurements with the quadratic fit shown in black , and the best linear fit ",
    "again only for the data points on the right side of the dashed line  in red .",
    "inclusion of more points for the linear fit again makes the agreement much worse .",
    "it is apparent that without sufficient dynamic range it is easy to be misled in fitting a linear curve to the data .",
    "including all the data points down to a strain of 10@xmath148 demonstrates the correctness of the quadratic fit .",
    "to summarize : the experimental data in gtj is apparently correct , but the dynamic range of the data points analyzed is _ not _ sufficient to draw any conclusion regarding the nonlinear behavior of the material .",
    "finally we are unable to understand the remark in gtj that the traditional theory of nonlinear elasticity predicts a value of @xmath149 at a strain of roughly @xmath147 .",
    "all that traditional theory predicts is a quadratic frequency shift which we do observe ; the magnitude is set by a certain dynamic nonlinearity coefficient which , in effect , is measured in the experiment .",
    "no contradiction with classical nonlinear theory is observed in our experiment or indeed in the data of gtj .",
    "next , we turn to the results found in s&t .",
    "one of the main objectives in that work was to investigate the dependence of the frequency shift ( hence , the shift in the young s modulus ) as a function of temperature changes .",
    "the idea was that static hysteresis mechanisms ( if present at very low strains ) could be due to thermal activation instead of mechanical stick - slip processes as in quasi - static experiments at much higher strain .",
    "( however , the authors did not directly investigate if the system showed cuspy hysteretic behavior in the first place . )    experiments at temperatures ranging from 35@xmath85 to 65@xmath85 were carried out .",
    "in addition different strain regimes were investigated at different times , as shown in the previous figure [ fig : old](a ) .",
    "the condition of the rock might have changed in between these different times , which could have led to a contamination of the results .",
    "data - fitting was carried out by fitting to a simple pole response characteristic , however , the possible systematic errors in this procedure were not discussed .",
    "in addition , for each temperature , the three different sets of measurements at low , medium , and high strain were shifted in order to obtain a single measurement over a wide strain range .",
    "this approach is likely to lead to a bias in the result since the rock might have been in different metastable conditioned states for each data set .    in the final step ,",
    "the relative shift in the young s modulus was determined and fitted by a single function for _ all _ resonance frequency shift curves , independent of the temperature at which they were taken or the resonance frequency @xmath75 ( recall the different strain ranges of the data shown in figure  [ fig : old ] ) .",
    "the result of this analysis is shown in figure  6 of s&t .",
    "it is immediately clear that a single fit to all the curves is rather dangerous and the single fit ( solid line in figure  6 ) does not work particularly well .",
    "the functional form of the fit  first linear and then quadratic  is therefore also not very meaningful , since no error bars are shown , any other functional form , such as pure quadratic , would have probably worked as well .",
    "the authors contention that the temperature - insensitivity of the coefficients determining the frequency shift is directly related to the underlying loss mechanism  and hence rules out thermal activation mechanisms  is incorrect .",
    "the relationship between the frequency shift and the loss mechanism is yet to be elucidated : as shown in the present work for example , nonlinear frequency shifts and linear losses can easily coexist and it is well - known that the loss factor is temperature - dependent .    in summary ,",
    "the measurements used in gtj and s&t are in fact in very good agreement with our current measurements and understanding of the nonlinearities in rocks below a certain strain threshold  it is the interpretation of the data in these two papers that must be corrected . in gtj",
    "the strain range over which the analysis was carried out was insufficient to reach any conclusive result about the fall - off of the resonance frequency peak with strain . in s&t",
    "the fitting procedure applied to the data sets seems to have led to erroneous conclusions about the behavior of @xmath6 versus strain .",
    "in this paper we have described a set of resonant bar experiments carried out for berea , fontainebleau , and acrylic ( as a linear control material ) in order to investigate the dynamic compliance and loss mechanisms at low strains , between @xmath150 and @xmath151 . to ensure isolation from environmental influences , such as temperature and humidity ,",
    "an isolation chamber was employed to obtain controlled and repeatable results .",
    "the main conclusion of our work is the demarcation of two strain regimes : in the first regime the material displays reversible softening of the resonance frequency , while in the second regime , which occurs after a material and environment - dependent threshold @xmath3 , nonequilibrium and conditioning effects become important .",
    "some of these results were previously reported in a short communication [ _ tencate et al . _",
    "2004 ] . here",
    "we report the results of a detailed study for the first strain regime  below @xmath3  for both berea and fontainebleau samples measuring quantities such as the quality factor , stress - strain loops , and amplitudes of higher harmonics . by repeating measurements on the same samples",
    "we have demonstrated the robustness of the results . at strains characteristic of reversible nonlinear behavior",
    ", the quality factor is essentially constant , but it is possible that it reduces at higher strain values .",
    "it is not unreasonable to speculate that  unlike the resonance frequency shift ",
    "the amplitude dependence of the quality factor is connected to the onset of nonequilibrium behavior , but this aspect requires further investigation .",
    "the data analysis was carried using a statistical method based on a gaussian process model .",
    "this parameter - free method avoids any biasing of the analysis due to fitting of the resonance curves with specific functional forms .",
    "it also determines reliable error bars for the resonance frequency shift @xmath6 as a function of the applied drive strength .",
    "the vast majority of previous papers analyzing similar experiments do not provide a detailed error analysis .    a theoretical framework for the experimental results",
    "is provided by a simple damped duffing model for which closed - form results can be obtained .",
    "the duffing model predictions are in excellent agreement with the entire set of experimental measurements over the strain regime @xmath69 .",
    "our results are in disagreement with some of the previous work carried out with the resonant bar technique as has been pointed out at the relevant places in the main body of the paper . in two cases  _ smith and tencate _ , [ 2000 ] and _ guyer et al .",
    "_ ,  [ 1999 ]  we have reanalyzed a subset of the older experimental data and have demonstrated that the disagreement is _ not _ due to fundamental differences in the data but due to mistakes in the theoretical interpretation and analysis in these papers .",
    "thus , one goal of this paper is simply to clarify the present state of knowledge in the low - strain regime .",
    "while in this paper , we have focused on the reversible nonlinear regime ( @xmath69 ) , future work will target the understanding of the nonequilibrium behavior of geomaterials .",
    "the investigation of this second regime is at the same time fascinating and very challenging .",
    "it is difficult , but essential , to disentangle conditioning / nonequilibrium and nonlinear effects .",
    "new experimental strategies have to be developed for this endeavor . at the same time a theoretical framework which encompasses and explains all known physical effects needs to be developed .",
