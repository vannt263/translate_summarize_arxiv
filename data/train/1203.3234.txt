    "diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) operating at expanding shock waves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is widely accepted as the mechanism to convert the kinetic energy released by supernova explosions into the energy of relativistic protons and nuclei ( or cosmic rays ) that obey a power - law type distribution . in dsa theory , cosmic rays ( crs )",
    "being accelerated at shocks must be scattered by self - generated magnetic turbulence .",
    "since the highest - energy crs upstream in the shock precursor are prone to lack self - generated turbulence , they are expected to escape from the shock .",
    "the character of escaping crs reflects complex interplay between crs and magnetic turbulence , which is yet to be understood .",
    "dsa theory generally predicts that a substantial fraction of the shock energy is carried away by escaping crs , and therefore they should be treated as an integral part of the dsa process @xcite .",
    "depending on the amount of nuclear crs released by a supernova remnant ( snr ) and the diffusion coefficient in the interstellar medium , the molecular clouds illuminated by escaping crs in the vicinity of snrs are expected to be luminous in @xmath0-rays due to the enhanced @xmath1-decay @xmath0-rays @xcite . the tev @xmath0-ray emission seen in the vicinity of snr",
    "w28 @xcite can be regarded as a realization of this scenario .",

    "* ) provide an interesting opportunity to study how crs escape from snrs and propagate in the interstellar medium .",
    "however , it has not been clear whether the @xmath0-ray emission is produced by escaping crs or by trapped crs @xcite , since shocked molecular clouds inside a snr also could be the sites of efficient @xmath0-ray production @xcite .",
    "in this letter , we report the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) observations of the region around snr w44 .",
    "we demonstrate that the @xmath0-ray emission distributed on a spatial scale much larger than the remnant is attributable to a cr halo around snr w44 .",
    "the lat onboard _ fermi _ is a pair - conversion @xmath0-ray detector that covers a very wide range of energy from 20 mev to @xmath3300 gev @xcite .",
    "the lat tracks the electron and positron resulting from pair conversion of an incident @xmath0-ray in thin high-@xmath4 foils , and measures the energy deposition due to the subsequent electromagnetic shower that develops in the calorimeter .",

    "the systematic errors are evaluated from different choices of the sky models describing w44 and src-1/2 and from the uncertainties of the effective area .",
    "the imperfection of the diffuse emission model and its possible impact on the results are discussed below .",
    "we tested a smoothly broken power - law and exponentially cutoff power - law for src-1/2 but found that the spectral fits do not significantly improve .",
    "we have discovered gev @xmath0-ray sources on the periphery of snr w44 .",
    "it has long been known that a complex of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) surrounds snr w44 ; the spatial extent is as large as 100 pc and the total mass of the complex amounts to @xmath20 @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : co ] , the @xmath0-ray emission from the surroundings of w44 is compared with a co ( @xmath21 ) map @xcite integrated over a velocity range of 30 to 65 km s@xmath22 appropriate for the gmc complex .",
    "the regions of excess @xmath0-rays overlap with the surrounding gmc complex .",
    "the @xmath0-ray emission in the vicinity of w44 can be ascribed formally to possible imperfection of the maps of gas column densities used in the model of the galactic interstellar diffuse emission , or to a local enhancement of cr density .",
    "the former implies that the mass in the @xmath0-ray - emitting region around w44 is underestimated by a large factor ( @xmath23 ) , or it requires the presence of unknown background clouds with a huge mass of @xmath24 .",
    "therefore an overabundance of crs in the vicinity of w44 offers a more sensible explanation ; we present a model in which the gmc complex is illuminated by crs that were produced in snr w44 and escaped from it .",
    "we first model the @xmath0-ray emission from w44 itself , and then proceed with modeling the @xmath0-ray emission from the surroundings .",
    "we adopt the following parameters to describe snr w44 ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) : ( i ) @xmath25 as the distance to w44 based on the firm association with the surrounding gmcs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; ( ii ) @xmath26 as the radius ( corresponding to the angular radius of @xmath27 ) ; ( iii ) the kinetic energy released by the supernova @xmath28 ; ( iv ) the ejecta mass @xmath29 ; and ( v ) the remnant age01 associated with snr w44 , @xmath30 yr @xcite . ] @xmath31 . assuming evolution in the uniform intercloud medium ,",
    "these parameters imply that the intercloud medium has hydrogen density of @xmath32 and the sedov - taylor phase started around @xmath33 yr when the radius was @xmath34 pc .",
    "a high - resolution radio continuum map of snr w44 is dominated by filamentary structures of synchrotron radiation @xcite .",
    "the radio emission is thought to arise from radiatively - compressed gas behind fast dissociative shocks driven into molecular clouds that are engulfed by the blastwave @xcite .",
    "assuming typical magnetic fields of molecular clouds , the gev @xmath0-ray flux relative to the radio flux is expected to be high enough to account for the @xmath0-ray emission from snr w44 , irrespective of the origin of the high - energy particles @xcite .",
    "the dense radio - emitting filaments are indeed the most probable sites of the dominant @xmath0-ray production in snr w44 , given the estimated mass of @xmath35 @xcite which is @xmath36 times larger than the swept - up intercloud mass . assuming a pre - shock cloud density of @xmath37 @xcite and a pre - shock magnetic field of @xmath38 g",
    ", we can estimate the compressed gas density and magnetic field in the filaments as @xmath39 and @xmath40 mg following the prescription in @xcite .    for simplicity",
    "we describe the energy distributions of cr electrons and protons in the filaments as a cut - off power law in momentum : @xmath41 , where the index is chosen to match the radio spectral index of @xmath42 @xcite . the ratio of radio and @xmath0-ray fluxes yields @xmath43 . the spectral break in the lat spectrum is reproduced by @xmath44 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] , the spectrum below a few gev is dominated by the decays of @xmath1-mesons produced in the dense filaments , while the falling part of the lat spectrum is contributed largely by the electron bremsstrahlung .",
    "the energy density of the cr protons amounts to @xmath45 , which could be explained by reacceleration of galactic crs ( gcrs ) pre - existing in a molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "however , we do not specify the dominant source of the @xmath0-ray - emitting particles , since freshly accelerated crs could also enter the filaments diffusively from the intercloud medium . provided that @xmath46 corresponds to the mean cr density in the shell of the remnant , the total kinetic energy of crs is @xmath47 .",
    "the cr distributions in the surroundings of snr w44 should be determined by ( 1 ) how crs are released into the ambient medium , and ( 2 ) the diffusion coefficient of the interstellar medium , @xmath48 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we consider only cr protons since leptonic emissions are unimportant for an _ e - p _ ratio of @xmath49 .",
    "also , the non - detection of synchrotron radio emission from the gmc complex indicates that electron bremsstrahlung is not the main @xmath0-ray production mechanism .",
    "let us assume that crs with a momentum @xmath50 can escape from the surface of a snr at time @xmath51 when the snr radius becomes @xmath52 , and that @xmath53 has a power - law form : @xmath54 where we adopt @xmath55 and @xmath56 , following @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this implies that snr w44 is currently releasing crs with @xmath57 .",
    "a simple sedov - taylor evolution gives @xmath58 .",
    "the runaway cr spectrum integrated over snr expansion is expected to be of the form @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "however , depending on the time history of acceleration efficiency and maximum energy , it could be different from @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "we parameterize the total spectrum of crs injected into the interstellar space as @xmath61 .",
    "the distribution function of the runaway crs at time @xmath62 at a distance @xmath63 from the snr center , @xmath64 , is described by a well - known diffusion equation , which can be solved using the method developed by @xcite .",
    "we use the following solution of the diffusion equation @xcite : @xmath65,\\ ] ] where @xmath66 } .\\ ] ] the diffusion coefficient of the interstellar medium is often parameterized as @xmath67 with constants of @xmath68 and @xmath69 based on the gcr propagation model @xcite . the diffusion coefficient in the close vicinity of a snr",
    "may be different from the galactic average , for example , because of alfvn waves generated by crs themselves @xcite .",
    "we allow @xmath70 to vary , but fix the index to be @xmath71 for simplicity .",
    "given that the @xmath0-ray emission by the escaping crs is visible against snr w44 in the lat image , we expect the size of the cr halo , @xmath72 , is much larger than the size of the remnant @xmath73 pc .",
    "since we find @xmath74 for @xmath75 , we set @xmath76 . note however that the constraint depends on the exact choice of @xmath77 ; @xmath78 is obtained for @xmath79 yr .",
    "to calculate the @xmath0-ray emission from the surroundings of w44 , we also need to specify the mass distribution .",
    "the total mass of the cloud complex illuminated by the runaway crs is estimated as @xmath80 by adding up six molecular clouds ( clouds 16 ) in @xcite .",
    "the mass is assumed to be uniformly distributed within the radius of the molecular cloud complex , @xmath81 pc . given the spherical symmetry of the model , we combine the @xmath0-ray spectra of src-1 and src-2 .    effectively , our model has three adjustable parameters , @xmath70 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] , we determine @xmath82 ( i.e. , the normalization ) and @xmath83 to reproduce the @xmath0-ray spectrum for three values of the diffusion coefficient : @xmath84 . for slow diffusion of @xmath85 , a steep index of @xmath86 is required since cr protons with @xmath87 are still within the gmc complex .",
    "crs at higher energies are leaking from the complex , and correspondingly the @xmath0-ray spectrum exhibits a break at @xmath88 gev . though the steep injection index required for the slow diffusion case is not theoretically expected @xcite , this problem may be alleviated by adopting a larger value of @xmath89 .",
    "the total amount of crs released into interstellar space amounts to @xmath90 . for a nominal value of @xmath91",
    ", we obtain @xmath92 and @xmath93 ; the @xmath0-ray spectrum in the lat range is steepened due to energy - dependent escape from the gmc complex . finally , we find @xmath92 and @xmath94 to reproduce the spectrum in the case of @xmath95 .",
    "we estimate that the energy channeled into the escaping crs amounts to @xmath2 . on the other hand , the cr content trapped in w44",
    "is estimated roughly as @xmath96 assuming a uniform cr distribution between the snr shell and radio filaments (  [ sec : w44 ] ) . a combination of the _",
    "fermi_-lat data to be obtained with longer exposures , and future operation of the cherenkov telescope array ( cta ) will put more stringent constraints on the models through determination of @xmath0-ray spatial distributions as a function of energy .",
