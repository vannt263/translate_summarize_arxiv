    "accordingly , in the physics programme at planned high energy ( and high luminosity ) colliders , much emphasis is given to precise measurements of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 couplings .",
    "such measurements should eventually confirm the sm , or maybe discover ` anomalous ' values of these couplings indicating physics beyond the sm .    while experiments at low energy and precision measurements in @xmath5 annihilation at the @xmath6 pole can provide _ indirect _ access to these constants @xcite , only high energy colliders , well above the threshold for @xmath0-pair production",

    ", the sm couplings are such that the gauge cancellation exactly occurs in the asymptotic regime , and consequently the sm cross section has a decreasing behavior with @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "considering the following modification of the @xmath9- and @xmath11-exchange amplitudes ( @xmath12 ) : @xmath13 where @xmath14 s linearly depend on the anomalous couplings , and introducing the relative deviation from the sm prediction for the cross section ( either total , or differential , or integrated in some angular range ) : @xmath15 one has : @xmath16 here , taking into account the @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) helicities @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , for later convenience the neutrino - exchange amplitude has been divided into the @xmath21 part @xmath22 plus the @xmath23 part @xmath24 . as evident in eq .",

    "thus , if we parametrize the sensitivity of process ( [ proc ] ) to @xmath14 by , e.g. , the ratio @xmath32 , with @xmath33 the statistical uncertainty experimentally attainable on the sm cross section , such a sensitivity is power - like enhanced with increasing @xmath8 , even at fixed integrated luminosity , namely @xmath34 . ) also applies to other non - standard effects , such as , e.g. , @xmath35 mixing @xcite and lepton mixing @xcite . ]    as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , a dramatic improvement in the sensitivity to anomalous values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 vertices should be obtained if the initial electron beam were longitudinally polarized , and one could separately measure the cross sections for both @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) and @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) annihilation . in particular , although being suppressed by @xmath40 compensation and thus leading to lower statistics , @xmath39 has the advantage of being free of the neutrino - exchange contribution . in general , @xmath24 numerically dominates the sm @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and is not modified by anomalous trilinear couplings , so that it tends to diminish the sensitivity of these cross sections to such effects .",
    "consequently , one can qualitatively expect @xmath43 to allow improved constraints even in the case of just one anomalous coupling taken as a free parameter .",

    "in this paper we will present an estimate , along the lines exposed above , of the bounds on the anomalous three - boson coupling constants that can be obtained from the analysis of the process @xmath4 based on the combination of polarized cross sections , at the reference energy of the planned @xmath5 linear colliders , namely @xmath51 up to @xmath52 , with polarized electron beams and assuming that also @xmath53 polarization will be measured .",

    "the latter is an attractive option at @xmath5 storage rings like lep  200 @xcite , where electron and positron spins naturally align in opposite directions in the magnetic field of the accelerator .",
    "the transverse polarization could be exploited to perform the model independent analysis , assuming the possibility of measuring final @xmath53 polarizations also in this case .",
