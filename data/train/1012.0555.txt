    "the discovery that ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) produce dense , color deconfined matter that thermalizes quickly into a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite and subsequently evolves like an almost perfect liquid @xcite with near - minimal viscosity @xcite has generated intense interest in a quantitative determination of the qgp transport properties @xcite . since the qgp liquid stage is sandwiched between an early pre - equilibrium and a final hadronic rescattering and decoupling stage , both of which have different transport properties , such a determination requires a complete dynamical description of all stages of the fireball expansion @xcite . stated differently ,",
    "when one uses experimental observables that are sensitive to the transport properties of the expanding medium ( for example , the elliptic flow @xmath0 has been shown to be particularly sensitive to shear viscosity @xcite ) , contributions from the pre - equilibrium and hadronic freeze - out stages to these observables must be accurately known for a precise determination of the qgp transport coefficients .",
    "purely hydrodynamic calculations , that substitute hydrodynamic initial conditions for a full dynamical solution of the pre - equilibrium stage and replace the kinetic hadron freeze - out process by a sudden transition from thermalized fluid to non - interacting particles using the cooper - frye prescription @xcite , require additional parameters whose values may influence the extracted thermal and transport properties , and they will always be plagued by irreducible systematic uncertainties in the extracted values that result from the crude modeling of the early and late non - equilibrium stages .",
    "this insight is not new , and it has spurred the development of hybrid algorithms that describe different stages of the expansion with different tools for the last ten years .",
    "the main advantage of a hydrodynamic description ( where valid ) over kinetic theory is its relative simplicity : only a few macroscopic fields ( energy and baryon density , pressure and flow velocity ) must be evolved in space - time , whereas the microscopic approach requires to follow the evolution of both the momenta and positions of all particles .",
    "the phenomenological success of hydrodynamic modeling for heavy - ion collisions thus leads naturally to the concept of using a fluid dynamical description as the backbone of the complete evolution model , interfaced with computationally more demanding microscopic algorithms to describe the early and late non - equilibrium stages . for the hadronic rescattering phase several microcopic algorithms that solve coupled boltzmann equations for the hadron distribution functions were developed and extensively tested in the 1980s and 90s @xcite .",
    "hybrid codes that coupled an ideal fluid dynamical description of an expanding qgp to such hadronic rescattering codes and compared the results with purely fluid dynamical calculations began to appear about ten years ago @xcite . here",
    "we present the first hybrid model that interfaces _ viscous _ relativistic hydrodynamics ( specifically the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional algorithm vish2 + 1  @xcite ) with a hadronic boltzmann cascade ( specifically the monte carlo algorithm urqmd  @xcite ) , via the `` hydro - to - oscar '' converter h@xmath1o  that converts hydrodynamic output into hadrons , with positions and momenta given in oscar format that can be read by urqmd .",
    "we call this hybrid code vishnu . in the present version of vishnu",
    "the pre - equilibrium stage is not yet described dynamically , but continues to be replaced by initial conditions for the fluid dynamic evolution .    an essential ingredient in vishnu",
    "is the use of a state - of - the - art equation of state ( eos ) for hot qcd matter , s95p - pce @xcite , which incorporates our best knowledge of the relation between pressure , energy and entropy density in the deconfined qgp stage from lattice qcd @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and matches it to a realistic hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) at low temperatures , taking into account that the abundances of stable hadrons ( after strong decays of unstable resonances ) are experimentally known to freeze out at @xmath2mev @xcite .",
    "this requires the introduction of properly adjusted , temperature dependent non - equilibrium chemical potentials for all hadronic species below @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "chemical freeze - out is immediate @xcite . ] and automatic in urqmd , due to the rapid three - dimensional expansion of the fireball in the hadronic stage @xcite .",
    "this implies that the hydrodynamic output that is fed into urqmd  must have the correct chemical composition , since otherwise the final hadron abundances disagree with experiment .",
    "if we decrease the switching temperature @xmath4 for the transition from hydrodynamics to hadron cascade below the chemical freeze - out temperature @xmath3 , the hydrodynamic output thus has to reflect the correct partial chemical equilibrium ( pce ) abundances that would , after resonance decays , produce the correct final yield ratios .",
    "this is also important for the elliptic flow : although the non - equilibrium chemical potentials have a very small effect on the equation of state @xmath5 @xcite , the distribution of the total momentum anisotropy among hadron species strongly depends on the chemical composition of the hadronic system @xcite .",
    "a comparison between chemical equilibrium and partial chemical equilibrium eos in ideal hydrodynamics shows that the breaking of chemical equilibrium in the hrg can increase the differential elliptic flow @xmath6 for pions by 25% @xcite .",
    "vishnu  was developed to remove uncertainties from non - equilibrium dynamics during the late hadronic stage when extracting qgp transport coefficients from experimentally measured final hadron spectra .",
    "the main goals of the present article , however , are purely conceptual : by comparing the hadron spectra and differential elliptic flow from vishnu  with those from purely hydrodynamic simulations with different ( temperature dependent ) values for the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio @xmath7 during the hrg stage , we want to establish to what extent the microscopic urqmd  dynamics of the hrg phase can be mimicked by an effective macroscopic calculation based on viscous fluid dynamics . by varying the switching temperature between vish2 + 1  and urqmd  we explore the existence of a `` switching window '' , i.e. of a range of temperatures within which both vish2 + 1  ( with an appropriate choice of transport coefficients ) and urqmd  provide a valid description of the fireball evolution .",
    "our goal here is _ not _ to compare vishnu  with experimental data from rhic ; this is done elsewhere @xcite .",
    "consequently , we explore the sensitivity of our results to variations in the hydrodynamic initial conditions only to the extent that they affect the answer to the above questions .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we briefly present the three components of vishnu : the viscous hydrodynamic algorithm vish2 + 1 , the hydro - to - micro converter h@xmath1o , and the hadron cascade urqmd . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we compare basic observables ( spectra and elliptic flow ) from vishnu  and pure viscous hydrodynamics , using both chemical equilibrium and pce equations of state as input . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we test the switching temperature dependence of the final spectra and elliptic flow obtained with vishnu , extracting an effective viscosity @xmath8 for urqmd  under dynamical conditions provided by rhic collisions .",
    "we interpret our findings and summarize our results in sec .",
    "appendix  [ appa ] describes tests of the hydro - to - micro converter h@xmath1o  and shows some results that demonstrate its accuracy .",
    "in this section we describe the structure of vishnu , a hybrid code that couples the viscous hydrodynamic expansion of the qgp stage in heavy - ion collisions to a microscopic kinetic evolution of the dilute late hadronic stage using a boltzmann monte carlo approach .",
    "the hydrodynamic component allows for ideal fluid evolution in the limit of zero transport coefficients .",
    "we here include only shear viscosity , neglecting bulk viscous contributions from the qgp and hadronization stages whose effects on spectra and elliptic flow are expected to be small @xcite . we assume zero net baryon density everywhere and thus",
    "do not follow explicitly the evolution of the baryon current .",
    "the latter can be easily included in future versions of the code .",
    "the viscous hydrodynamic and microscopic kinetic algorithms are interfaced with each other through the monte carlo event generator h@xmath1o  that converts hydrodynamic output on a hypersurface of constant temperature @xmath4 to particles , by sampling the corresponding cooper - frye @xcite phase - space distributions , including viscous corrections .",
    "this procedure requires switching temperatures @xmath4 that are low enough for urqmd  to provide a reliable description of the subsequent hadronic rescattering dynamics .",
    "the highest possible switching temperature is therefore @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the ( pseudo)critical temperature for the quark - hadron phase transition .",
    "higher @xmath4 values would require a microscopic description of the hadronization process itself , including accompanying changes in vacuum structure , and knowledge of the effective particle degrees of freedom during this process .",
    "this is at present an unsolved problem .",
    "for comparison we also perform purely hydrodynamic simulations without the hadronic cascade , by running vish2 + 1  to lower temperatures and decoupling directly into free - streaming particles , by using the cooper - frye prescription at @xmath11 .",
    "these comparison runs are done with constant or temperature - dependent specific shear viscosities @xmath7 in the hadronic phase .",
    "for the qgp phase we use constant @xmath7 , motivated the weak ( logarithmic ) temperature dependence of @xmath7 predicted by perturbative qcd in the weak - coupling limit @xcite and the temperature independence of @xmath7 predicted by the ads / cft correspondence in the strong coupling limit @xcite .",
    "qcd is not a conformal field theory and that therefore in the temperature region accessible at rhic ( @xmath12 ) @xmath7 might very well feature a stronger temperature dependence than predicted by both perturbative qcd and the strong coupling limit for conformal field theories .",
    "heavy - ion experiments at the lhc are expected to shed light on this question . ]    in the following subsections we discuss the components of vishnu  in more detail .      for the hydrodynamic stage we use vish2 + 1 , a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamic code with longitudinal boost invariance @xcite . the specific implementation used in the present work , including the equation of state s95p - pce ,",

    "runs we also employ the equation of state sm - eos  q described in @xcite which assumes a first - order quark - hadron phase transition and chemical equilibrium ( ce ) in the hadronic phase .",
    "the comparison between pure hydrodynamic simulations with s95p - pce and sm - eos  q ( ce ) emphasizes the effects arising from the breaking of chemical equilibrium in the hadronic phase at temperatures below @xmath14mev .",
    "different from ref .",
    "@xcite , we here use as default initial conditions an initial energy density profile taken to be 100% proportional to the wounded nucleon density from the optical glauber model whose peak energy density in central ( @xmath15 ) au+au collisions is normalized to @xmath16gev/@xmath17 , with @xmath18fm/@xmath19 .",
    "this gives roughly the correct final charged hadron multiplicity @xmath20 in central collisions , but does not correctly reproduce its measured nonlinear dependence on the total number of wounded nucleons @xmath21 in noncentral collisions . for the purposes of the present conceptual study",

    "the resulting smooth average entropy density is converted to an initial energy density profile using the eos .",
    "this procedure accounts , in an average way , for event - by - event fluctuations in the initial source eccentricity , giving ( depending on impact parameter ) @xmath22 larger initial eccentricities than the optical glauber model ( see @xcite for details ) . for both optical glauber and fluctuating fkln initial profiles we assume zero transverse flow at the beginning of the hydrodynamic evolution at @xmath23 .      to convert the hydrodynamic output into particles that can then be further propagated with the hadron cascade urqmd  we first use the azhydro algorithm to find an isothermal freeze - out surface @xmath24 of temperature @xmath4 and then calculate the hadron spectra with the cooper - frye formula  @xcite ( see @xcite for details ) .",

    "urqmd  takes the full local temperature and particle fugacity dependence of the hadronic viscosity into account @xcite , even though it may be challenging to quantify the exact value of the hadronic viscosity inherent in the urqmd  calculation of the hadronic phase ( due to its dependence not only on temperature but also on multiple ( non - equilibrium ! ) particle fugacities ) .",
    "in this subsection we calculate transverse momentum spectra and elliptic flow for identified hadrons in the hybrid approach and compare them to pure ideal and viscous hydrodynamic calculations , focusing in particular on the eos and the @xmath11 dependences of the calculations .",

    "when we use vish2 + 1  with s95p - pce , we ensure that the pure hydrodynamic and vishnu  hybrid simulations use the same non - equilibrium chemical composition in the hadronic stage ; in this case the difference lies only in the assumption of ( approximate ) thermal equilibrium for the hydrodynamic runs whereas the urqmd  cascade in vishnu  allows the system to evolve far out of local thermal equilibrium , all the way to final decoupling .",

    "the hydrodynamic pion spectra are almost insensitive to the choice of kinetic decoupling temperature @xmath11 , agreeing well with their counterparts from the hybrid model vishnu  in all cases .",
    "the hydrodynamic proton spectra become flatter as @xmath11 decreases , due to build - up of additional radial flow , and the best agreement with the hybrid model is achieved for the lowest value shown in the graph ( @xmath53mev ) .",

    "figure  [ f1 ] shows that all of the above statements hold irrespective of whether we assume zero or non - zero viscosity during the qgp stage : in both cases the transverse momentum spectra from the hybrid code vishnu  can be well represented by purely hydrodynamic simulations with @xmath53mev and @xmath7 values that do not change between the qgp and hadron gas stages .",

    "[ f1 ] show that the same is not true when we use sm - eos  q in the hydrodynamic code which assumes chemical equilibrium in the hadronic stage , contrary to the underlying microscopic urqmd  dynamics . in this case agreement between the pion spectra from vishnu  and the purely hydrodynamic simulations",

    "we conclude that , at the level of single - particle @xmath56 spectra , it is possible to simulate the full microscopic dynamics of the urqmd  hadron cascade by viscous ( or even ideal ) fluid dynamics as long as a pce eos is used that correctly describes the non - equilibrium chemical composition in urqmd , and one allows for the buildup of additional hadronic radial flow by setting a low decoupling temperature @xmath57mev . with sm - eos  q(ce ) , purely hydrodynamic simulations are unable to reproduce the vishnu  spectra for any choice of @xmath11 ; for the convenience of the following academic comparison of elliptic flow @xmath0 within these two approaches , we choose for sm - eos  q the `` historical standard value '' @xmath54mev @xcite .",

    "this reflects the fact that in the hadronic stage the fireball is still out - of - plane elongated , and demonstrates that even a viscous fluid with @xmath59 , but especially an ideal fluid is much more efficient than urqmd  in converting this residual fireball eccentricity into additional elliptic flow .    to quantify the suppression of integrated elliptic flow by viscous qgp and hadronic dissipation effects",

    "the same does not hold , however , for the elliptic flow : since at rhic energies the fireball is still out - of - plane elongated when its matter enters the hrg phase , the momentum anisotropy continues to grow during the hadronic stage , and urqmd  is less efficient in converting the residual source eccentricity into elliptic flow than vish2 + 1  if one uses the same minimal @xmath7 in both phases .",

    "<S> a hybrid transport approach for the bulk evolution of viscous qcd matter produced in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the expansion of the dense deconfined phase of the reaction is modeled with viscous hydrodynamics while the dilute late hadron gas stage is described microscopically by the boltzmann equation . </S>",
    "<S> the advantages of such a hybrid approach lie in the improved capability of handling large dissipative corrections in the late dilute phase of the reaction , including a realistic treatment of the non - equilibrium hadronic chemistry and kinetic freeze - out . by varying the switching temperature at which the hydrodynamic output is converted to particles for further propagation with the boltzmann cascade we test the ability of the macroscopic hydrodynamic approach to emulate the microscopic evolution during the hadronic stage and extract the temperature dependence of the effective shear viscosity of the hadron resonance gas produced in the collision . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the extracted values depend on the prior hydrodynamic history and hence do not represent fundamental transport properties of the hadron resonance gas . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that viscous fluid dynamics does not provide a faithful description of hadron resonance gas dynamics with predictive power , and that both components of the hybrid approach are needed for a quantitative description of the fireball expansion and its freeze - out . </S>"
