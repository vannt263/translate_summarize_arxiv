    "magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) mode conversion has long been proffered as an explanation of observations @xcite of @xmath0- and @xmath1-mode `` absorption '' by sunspots .",
    "several methods have been used to explore this question , including numerical solution of a differential eigenvalue problem ( _ e.g. _ , , ; , @xcite ; with results directly compared to the solar data in and ) , and direct numerical simulation @xcite .",
    "however , a very different technique , based on a generalization of ray theory @xcite presents several novel insights which greatly enhance interpretation and understanding . to date , this has been applied only in two dimensions ( 2d ) , in the sense that gravity , the magnetic field , and the direction of wave propagation all lie in the same plane , and we shall maintain that restriction here .",
    "this decouples the alfvn wave from the problem , leaving only the fast and slow magnetoacoustic waves ( although see for a quantitative estimation of 3d coupling ) .",
    "in particular , generalized ray theory ( grt ) has verified that mode transmission / conversion occurs at or near the equipartition level ( @xmath2 ) where the sound and alfvn speeds coincide , @xmath3 . a magnetoacoustic wave incident on this level",
    "is partially transmitted ( transmission coefficient @xmath4 ) and partially converted ( coefficient @xmath5 ) .",
    "grt introduces the concept of the attack angle ( @xmath6 ) , the angle between the wavevector and the magnetic field at the mode conversion level .",
    "if @xmath6 is small , transmission dominates , but if it is large , then conversion is favoured .    in any plausible sunspot model ,",
    "the sound speed ( @xmath7 ) varies slowly with height ( @xmath8 ) through the surface layers , but the alfvn speed ( @xmath9 ) increases rapidly due to the decreasing density ( @xmath10 ) . here , @xmath11 is the magnetic permeability ( @xmath12 in si units ) .",
    "for @xmath13 we have @xmath14 , whilst @xmath15 in the opposite regime @xmath16 . in @xmath14",
    "the fast wave is predominantly acoustic in nature , and the slow wave is largely magnetic . on the other hand , where @xmath15 the opposite pertains :",
    "the fast wave is magnetic and the slow wave is acoustic . in these asymptotic regimes ,",
    "the fast and slow magnetoacoustic waves are completely decoupled and distinguishable . however , in the conversion region ( @xmath17 ) they interact .",
    "importantly , the `` fast '' and `` slow '' waves do not maintain their identities through this coupling region .",
    "let us be clear about the meaning of `` transmission '' and `` conversion '' here .",
    "we say that a wave is totally transmitted ( @xmath18 ) if it maintains its acoustic or magnetic identity across the conversion layer .",
    "for example , a vertically propagating sound wave in vertical magnetic field does not interact with the magnetic field , since it is longitudinal , and stays a sound wave as it passes through @xmath2 : we call this total transmission .",
    "conversely , an incident acoustic wave in @xmath14 which passes through to become purely a magnetic wave is said to have been totally converted . of course ,",
    "in general , both transmission and conversion are partial .",
    "grt is only an approximate description of wave behaviour .",
    "it shares many of the flaws of standard mhd ray theory @xcite , though not the gross error of presuming perfect fast - fast or slow - slow connectivity across @xmath2 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath19 ) .",
    "specifically , it should be asymptotically correct in the high frequency limit , where wavelengths are vanishingly small compared to background inhomogeneity length scales .",
    "but how well does it perform in more realistic , moderate - frequency scenarios ? in this paper",
    ", we test the accuracy of the grt estimation of transmission coefficient @xmath4 in a simple , uniform - field , isothermal , gravitationally - stratified model for which exact wave solutions exist . although not exhibiting all of the features that we may wish in a sunspot model , it does possess the most important characteristic  a rapidly increasing @xmath20 ratio with height  which allows for a meaningful and informative test .",
    "we adopt the simplest model which exhibits the required features of increasing @xmath20 with height , with @xmath21 at some finite level : an isothermal , gravitationally - stratified atmosphere with uniform magnetic field inclined at angle @xmath22 to the vertical . without loss of generality , the equipartion level ( @xmath2 )",
    "is set at zero .",
    "a sound wave with horizontal and temporal dependence @xmath23 $ ] is launched upward from great depth , is incident on @xmath24 where it is partially transmitted and partially converted , and the resulting transmitted sound wave is examined in @xmath25 .",
    "the aim is to calculate the transmission coefficient ( @xmath4 ) at varying frequencies ( @xmath26 ) , horizontal wavenumbers ( @xmath27 ) , and field inclinations ( @xmath22 ) . in order that the sound wave is vertically propagating rather than evanescent , and that it is indeed an acoustic and not a gravity wave , @xmath28 is chosen to lie in region i of the acoustic - gravity wave dispersion diagram ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 1 ) , _ i.e. _ , above the upper branch of @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the acoustic cut - off frequency , @xmath31 is the square of the brunt - visl frequency , @xmath32 is the gravitational acceleration , and @xmath33 is the density scale height .",
    "this requires @xmath34 for @xmath35 , and a slightly more stringent condition for nonzero @xmath27 .",
    "however , in strong , inclined magnetic field , the `` ramp effect '' reduces the effective cut - off frequency to @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "this effective cut - off term will become apparent in the exact solutions of section [ sec : exact ] .",
    "following @xcite ( @xcite , @xcite ) , we define the following dimensionless variables : frequency @xmath37 , vertical position @xmath38 where @xmath33 is the ( constant ) density scale height , and the brunt - visl frequency @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the usual ratio of specific heats . in these units ,",

    "finally , @xmath46 is the dimensionless horizontal wavenumber , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 is the vertical dimensionless wavenumber in the equivalent non - magnetic case .",

    "generalized ray theory ( grt ) redresses one of the major failings of classical ray theory in the mhd context ; the failure to recognize wave transmission / conversion at avoided crossings of the fast and slow loci in phase space .",
    "it does this by adding a local wave - mechanical analysis in the neighbourhood of these `` star points '' in a way that is quite convenient for practical calculation .",
    "the applications to helioseismology by and have provided important new insights into the physics of near - surface mode mixing , which complement lessons learned from direct numerical solution of the wave equations ( _ e.g. _ , ; ) .    however , it is important to realize the strengths and limitations of this new tool . as with all ray theory",
    ", it works best at small wavelength .",
    "however , we have seen here that it is nonetheless extremely useful even at frequencies comparable to @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "the nature of the isothermal model precluded our reducing the frequency further , below @xmath115 , as the required incident sound wave then does not propagate at all .",
    "it is important to appreciate though that the true value of grt lies not in its ability to yield accurate transmission coefficients , which it certainly can do near the transmission peaks , but rather in its qualitative and physically compelling description of the processes in play .",
