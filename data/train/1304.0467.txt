    "finally , possible connections with conformal field theories provided by the ds / cft correspondence  @xcite add value to the study of asymptotically ds spacetimes . on the other hand , black holes are among the most relevant objects in any gravitational theory , besides there being clear indications of their presence at the center of galaxies  @xcite and the possibility of black hole ( bh ) formation in particle colliders  @xcite .",
    "these observations motivate the study of black holes in asymptotically ds spacetimes .",

    ", such problems have been studied extensively  @xcite . in asymptotically flat",
    "spacetimes it is common to express the outcome of scattering a wave off a black hole in terms of an absorption cross section .",
    "the absorption cross section is directly connected to the _ greybod factors _ ,",
    "i.e. , the probability for a given wave coming in from infinity to be absorbed by the black hole  @xcite .",
    "this has been shown to be equal to the transmission probability for an outgoing wave ` emitted ' from the black hole event horizon to reach the asymptotic region ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "it is the non - triviality of greybody factors that cause the semi - classical spectrum of emission of black holes to depart from that of a pure black body .    for asymptotically flat bh spacetimes",
    "there are indications that the greybody factor @xmath0 for waves of arbitrary spin @xmath1 and angular quantum number @xmath2 in any number of dimensions @xmath3 vanishes in the zero - frequency limit .",
    "this general statement is confirmed by all cases studied so far , and has actually been proven for massless minimally coupled scalar fields in stationary black hole backgrounds  @xcite in general spacetime dimensions . in @xmath4",
    "this phenomenon also occurs for massless spin-1/2 fermions , gauge bosons and gravitons  @xcite and persists even in the presence of non - minimal coupling of the scalar field with the curvature scalar  @xcite",

    "this means that at low energies the cosmological constant has an important effect on the greybody factor of massless minimally coupled scalar particles .",
    "the explanation put forward in  @xcite for this phenomenon is that zero - energy particles are fully delocalized , and have therefore a finite probability to traverse the distance between the two horizons  @xcite .",
    "this argument then suggests that the infrared enhancement of transmitted flux in sds is not present when fields are massive , since the dispersion relation gets modified by the addition of the mass . in this paper",

    "we show that , if @xmath9 , the greybody factor for the @xmath5 mode tends to zero in general like @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the frequency of the wave . we also show that the rate of hawking radiation tends to zero as @xmath12 if @xmath9 , unlike the case with @xmath13 , in which this rate remains finite in the low - frequency limit .",

    "a non - vanishing greybody factor in the low - frequency regime implies a nonzero hawking emission in the same limit . for @xmath151 , however , the emission rate in this limit is always zero .",

    "we observed that the coupling to the scalar curvature only has a significant effect on the emission rate at low frequencies , @xmath234 , and that the above - mentioned enhancement is more pronounced for larger black holes ( larger @xmath109 ) but becomes less significant as the coupling parameter @xmath15 grows .",
