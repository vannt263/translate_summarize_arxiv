    "the polarization of radiation emitted by distant radio galaxies and quasars offers a way to search for chiral effects in the propagation of electromagnetic radiation .",
    "such objects are often elongated in one direction , so that one may define a position angle @xmath0 which describes the orientation of the object on the sky .",
    "synchrotron radiation can lead to a significant linear polarization of the source , and the angle @xmath1 of the plane of polarization may also be measured @xcite .",
    "( the angle of polarization will typically undergo faraday rotation , but this effect can be removed by using the fact that faraday rotation is proportional to the square of the wavelength . )",
    "one can therefore study the relative angle @xmath2 between the position and polarization vectors , keeping in mind that this quantity is only defined modulo @xmath3 .",
    "it has been found @xcite that @xmath2 is not distributed randomly ; there is a large peak at @xmath4 , and a smaller enhancement at @xmath5 . since many of these sources are at significant redshifts , and therefore very far away , testing whether this relationship is maintained for distant sources provides constraints on possible chiral effects on the propagation of light through the universe , which could rotate @xmath2 away from the intrinsic value ( that which would be measured at the source ) .    from a field theory point of view , the simplest such chiral effect arises from a lagrange density @xmath6 here , @xmath7 is the field strength for the electromagnetic field @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the dual field strength , and @xmath10 is a pseudoscalar field which need not be fundamental ( it can be a function of other fields in the theory ) .",
    "we set @xmath11 throughout .",
    "this lagrangian is the simplest way to couple a neutral pseudoscalar to electromagnetism in a parity - invariant way , and often describes the effective coupling of pseudoscalar particles ( such as pions or axions ) to photons .",
    "our interest here is in the case where @xmath10 varies only very slowly over extremely large distances . in that case",
    "an electromagnetic wave travelling through the background @xmath10 field will undergo a rotation in its polarization state which depends on the change in @xmath10 ; such an effect arises in a variety of contexts @xcite-@xcite . in the wkb limit where the length scale for variations in @xmath10 is much larger than the wavelength of the photon , the polarization angle @xmath1 obeys the simple relation @xmath12 where @xmath13 indicates the change between source and observer .",
    "( here , and in eq .",
    "( [ deltachi ] ) below , @xmath14 is measured in radians ; elsewhere we measure all angles in degrees ; no confusion should arise . )",
    "this effect is independent of wavelength , and can therefore be distinguished from ordinary faraday rotation .",
    "carroll , field and jackiw @xcite suggested that observations of polarized radio sources provide a stringent test of such an effect , since they afford an opportunity to constrain @xmath15 over a large interval in space and time ( see also @xcite ) .    the specific model investigated in @xcite set @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a 4-vector whose expectation value parameterizes violation of lorentz invariance ( as well as cpt @xcite ) .",
    "it was hypothesized that there exists a preferred coordinate frame , close to the background robertson - walker frame of our universe , in which @xmath18 .",
    "this implies that the predicted rotation of the polarization angle for a source at redshift @xmath19 is given in terms of the timelike component @xmath20 and the spacelike vector @xmath21 by @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the angle between @xmath21 and the direction toward the source , and @xmath25 is the proper spacelike distance traveled . if we take a flat ( @xmath26 ) universe as a reasonable approximation , we have @xmath27\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the hubble constant today .",
    "regardless of whether or not one is interested in tests of lorentz invariance , eq .",
    "( [ deltachi ] ) is a useful parameterization of potentially observable chiral effects .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the radio galaxies at redshift greater than 0.4 , with maximum polarizations greater than @xmath29 , were strongly clustered around @xmath30 , using a sample of galaxies and redshifts obtained from the literature @xcite . assuming that the timelike component @xmath20 would be significantly larger than the spacelike part @xmath21 , the limit @xmath31 was obtained , where @xmath32  km / sec / mpc .",
    "recently , nodland and ralston @xcite , using the same set of data , ; entry 124 , coordinates 1626 + 27 ; entry 144 , @xmath33 ; and entry 153 , @xmath34 .",
    "we are grateful to borge nodland for informing us of these corrections . ]",
    "searched for anisotropic effects such as those that would arise from a nonzero spacelike part @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ deltachi ] ) .",
    "surprisingly , they claimed to find a significant signal in the data .",
    "given the fundamental importance of such a result , we have undertaken a re - examination of the data , and present our results in this paper .",
    "we conclude that the data are most consistent with no effect , contrary to @xcite .",
    "our disagreement stems primarily from the method used to disentangle the @xmath3 ambiguity in the quantity @xmath2 , and the use of randomly generated data for comparison purposes , as will be shown below .    as this manuscript",
    "was being completed we received a preprint by eisenstein and bunn @xcite , who come to conclusions similar to those expressed in this paper .",
    "we consider the same set of data as was used in @xcite , with the corrections noted above .",
    "this set includes 160 sources , with redshifts as high as 2.012 .",
    "the first step is to establish the existence of a reliable correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath0 , so that we may test its behavior for distant galaxies .",
    "following @xcite , we have divided the data into distant and nearby objects , with the division drawn at @xmath35 ; there are 89 sources with @xmath36 , and 71 with @xmath37 . in figures one and two ,",
    "we have plotted histograms of @xmath2 for these two sets .",
    "we have for the purposes of these figures defined @xmath2 so that it lies between @xmath38 and @xmath3 , and grouped the data into bins which are @xmath39 wide .    -0.75 cm    -0.1 cm    -0.75",
    "cm    -0.1 cm    in figure one , representing nearby galaxies , there appears to be evidence for a narrow enhancement at @xmath40 , and a broader peak at @xmath30 .",
    "however , the correlation is evidently not very strong .",
    "the most likely explanation for this fact is that many of these galaxies are members of a different population than those at high redshift , which can be observed only if they are of high luminosity , and the lower - luminosity galaxies demonstrate a weaker correlation between polarization and position angle . for the more distant galaxies shown in figure two , there is a very clear peak at @xmath30 .",
    "there is no noticeable peak at @xmath40 in this sample ; again , this may be explained if the galaxies with @xmath40 are members of a lower - luminosity population .",
    "( see @xcite for discussion of these correlations and their interpretation in terms of models of the sources . )",
    "it is reasonable to suppose that the galaxies with a higher degree of maximum polarization would show any effect more strongly than those that are polarized only weakly .",
    "we therefore show in figures three and four the same plots as in figures one and two , this time limited only to those sources with maximum polarization greater than or equal to @xmath29 .",
    "these are the sources that were analyzed in @xcite",
    ".    -0.75 cm    -0.1 cm    -0.75 cm    -0.1 cm    the peaks found in the previous plots , at @xmath38 and @xmath41 at low redshifts and more dramatically at @xmath41 in the high - redshift sample , are also evident in figure three and figure four , arguably more convincingly .",
    "however , any increased correlation is offset to some degree by the smaller number of data points .",
    "therefore , in the remainder of this paper we will not discard those sources with maximum polarization @xmath42 ; we will thus use precisely the same data as were analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the crux of our disagreement with @xcite can be found in figure two , the distribution of @xmath2 for sources with @xmath37 .",
    "as noted in @xcite , this plot constitutes vivid evidence that the polarization angle in these sources is intrinsically perpendicular to the position angle on the sky .",
    "if the claim of @xcite is true , it is necessary to believe that the peak at @xmath41 is an accident , and these data are actually drawn from a distribution which is intrinsically centered at @xmath38 , with position- and redshift - dependent contributions of order @xmath3 .",
    "we will argue in the next section that this is not the simplest interpretation of these data .",
    "searching for a signal in the polarization data is complicated by the fact that @xmath2 is only defined modulo @xmath3 . in testing any specific hypothesis , it is necessary to choose some reasonable procedure for resolving this ambiguity .",
    "the method chosen by the authors of @xcite was the following : for any choice of direction for the vector @xmath21 , define an angle @xmath43 which is between @xmath38 and @xmath3 if @xmath44 and between @xmath45 and @xmath38 if @xmath46 , where @xmath24 ( which they called @xmath47 ) is the angle between @xmath21 and the direction toward the source .",
    "it was noted in @xcite that this procedure necessarily introduces correlations between @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "it would be illegitimate , therefore , to take a statistical correlation between these two quantities as itself evidence of a signal in the data .",
    "however , if the degree of correlation were much higher than that which would be expected if there were no signal in the data , we might conclude that there was a measurable effect .",
    "it is at this point in the analysis that we find two important flaws in the procedure followed in @xcite .",
    "first , one must reliably determine the zero point for @xmath2 , which would be observed in the absence of any chiral effects . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors searched for a best fit to the data of the form @xmath50 , where in the notation of eq .",
    "[ deltachi ] , @xmath51 .",
    "they found that the favored value for the zero point was @xmath52 .",
    "this seems to be inconsistent with the evidence of figure two , which exhibits a peak at @xmath41 .",
    "the resolution is simply the fact that the definition of @xmath48 , as described above , separates the data into two groups , one with @xmath53 and one with @xmath54 . with this procedure",
    "the favored value for @xmath55 will always be near @xmath38 ; it arises essentially from taking the average of a group of points clustered around @xmath41 and another clustered around @xmath56 .",
    "this method of resolving the @xmath3 ambiguity is therefore inappropriate for data which lie naturally in the vicinity of @xmath41 .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite argues that the correlation found is statistically significant , as it was only very rarely reproduced in artificially generated sets of data .",
    "the procedure for generating these sets is the second important flaw that we find .",
    "figure two provides evidence that , regardless of the position of the source on the sky , @xmath2 is distributed approximately in a gaussian distribution centered on @xmath41 ; a best fit to the gaussian yields a dispersion of @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , in searching for position - dependent effects , it is appropriate to compare the actual data to data which is generated by drawing from a similar distribution . in @xcite , on the other hand , artificial realizations were generated completely randomly , _",
    "i.e. _ from a flat probability distribution for @xmath2 .",
    "this has a dramatic effect on the claimed significance of the result .",
    "we performed an independent analysis , using two different methods of generating the artificial data sets : first by drawing from a flat distribution , and then from a gaussian with the appropriate width .",
    "the numbers generated were values of @xmath2 for the positions and redshifts of the 71 sources in the sample with @xmath37 . in 1000 realizations of the data drawn from a flat distribution , in only 7 trials was the significance of the correlation greater than that in the actual data ; this is comparable to the 6 out of 1000 reported in @xcite , and if reliable would be evidence of the existence of a signal . on the other hand ,",
    "in 1000 realizations of the data drawn from the appropriate gaussian distribution , the artificial data was more strongly correlated with the hypothesized test function in 911 out of 1000 trials .",
    "even if there were no signal at all in the data , we would expect the artificial realizations to have a stronger correlation approximately @xmath58 of the time ; the fact that our trials had better correlations over @xmath59 of the time is due to the fact that the gaussian slightly underestimates the number of data points near @xmath38 .",
    "this result , however , vividly demonstrates our main point : the existence of a real enhancement of @xmath2 near @xmath41 leads to a spuriously large correlation coefficient if one uses the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "when this enhancement , which is consistent with conventional models of the sources , is taken into account , there is no sign of an additional effect such as that in eq .",
    "[ deltachi ] .",
    "there is another way of quantifying our claim that a random distribution centered around @xmath41 is a better fit to the data than the correlation proposed in @xcite .",
    "figure five is a plot of @xmath2 as a function of @xmath49 , where @xmath24 is defined using the best - fit direction quoted in @xcite and @xmath2 is defined to be between @xmath38 and @xmath3 .    -0.75",
    "cm    -0.1 cm    we may think of this graph as being defined on a cylinder , where @xmath38 is to be identified with @xmath3 . with this in mind , we have plotted two possible relationships , a solid horizontal line at @xmath41 and a dashed line at @xmath60 , where we have measured the parameters @xmath61 and @xmath55 from figure 1(d ) of @xcite . if the relationship claimed in @xcite is correct , the dashed line wrapping around the cylinder should be a better fit to the data than the solid horizontal line .",
    "this can be measured by calculating @xmath62 where we take the average error to be @xmath57 , although the precise value is irrelevant for purposes of comparison .",
    "the quantity @xmath63 , which represents the difference between the predicted and measured value of @xmath2 , is of course subject to the @xmath3 ambiguity ; however , we can resolve this ambiguity optimistically for each point , by defining @xmath64 . using this procedure , we calculate that the best fit proposed in @xcite yields @xmath65 , while the hypothesis of no effect yields @xmath66 .",
    "thus , the horizontal solid line in figure five is a much better fit than the diagonal dashed lines .",
    "given that there is ample evidence that the intrinsic zero point is centered on @xmath67 , we may ask how good a limit we can place on an effect such as that in eq .",
    "( [ deltachi ] ) .",
    "one approach to this problem is to define @xmath2 to be between @xmath38 and @xmath3 , and to assume that the deviation from the intrinsic value is given by @xmath68 .",
    "it is then possible to do a straightforward least - squares fit to eq .",
    "( [ deltachi ] ) , with the four components of @xmath17 as free parameters . using the data at redshifts @xmath37 ,",
    "the best - fit parameters obtained in this way are @xmath69 ( this procedure yields separate values for each of the three spacelike components @xmath70 ; since each value is consistent with no preferred direction , it is more appropriate to quote the limit on the magnitude @xmath71 . )",
    "these values are consistent with @xmath72 , and similar to the limit on @xmath20 from @xcite quoted in eq .",
    "( [ limit ] ) .",
    "after analyzing the data in a variety of ways , we are able to conclude with confidence that there is no evidence for a chiral effect on the propagation of photons from distant radio sources . despite this negative result , there are still good reasons to further pursue observations such as those examined in this paper .    -0.75 cm    -0.1 cm    -0.75 cm    -0.1 cm    in figures six and seven we have plotted the position of the sources in the sky , indicated by symbols related to the deviation of @xmath2 from @xmath41 .",
    "figure six includes all of the galaxies , while figure seven is limited to the distant sources with @xmath37 .",
    "the squares represent sources with @xmath73 , while the @xmath74 s are sources with @xmath75 .",
    "the size of the symbol is related linearly to the deviation from @xmath41 , although for clarity there is an offset so that points with @xmath2 very close to @xmath41 still have a nonzero size .",
    "one conclusion to be drawn immediately from these graphs is that there is a need for additional data to be collected in the southern celestial hemisphere , especially at high redshifts . in the future",
    ", observations of polarization of the cosmic microwave background may be the best source of data for constraining phenomena such as these @xcite .    in characterizing the limits one can place on chiral effects , for convenience we hypothesized a fixed four - vector @xmath17 which would represent a violation of lorentz invariance .",
    "if an effect were to be found , however , it is by no means necessary that such a profound conclusion would have to be drawn .",
    "a more plausible hypothesis would be that of a very slowly - varying scalar field @xmath10 with a coupling as in ( [ lag ] ) ; the application of the data discussed in this paper to this possibility was examined in @xcite .",
    "such a field could arise as an ultralight axion , with mass of order the hubble constant today ( or less ) .",
    "interestingly , such axions may appear naturally in the strongly coupled limit of heterotic string theory @xcite .",
    "another possibility is the detection of axion - like cosmic strings ; in the vicinity of such a string , the polarization angle of two light rays passing on either side will undergo rotations in opposite directions @xcite .",
    "although there is no obvious sign of such a signal in figures six and seven , the importance of such a finding encourages us to continue the search .",
    "we would like to thank ilana harrus , jack hughes , arthur kosowsky , and uros seljak for helpful conversations , and borge nodland for assistance with the data .",
