    "the fluorescence method of extensive air shower detection is based on recording light emitted by air molecules excited by charged particles of the shower .",
    "for very high energies of the primary particle , enough fluorescence light is produced by the large number of secondaries in the cascading process so that the shower can be recorded from a distance of many kilometers by an appropriate optical detector system @xcite . as the amount of fluorescence light is closely correlated to the particle content of a shower , it provides a calorimetric measure of the primary energy .    the particles in an air shower are strongly collimated around the shower axis .",
    "most of them are spread at distances smaller than several tens of meters from the axis , so that when viewed from a large distance , the shower resembles a luminous point on the sky .",
    "therefore , a one - dimensional approximation of the shower as being a point source might be adequate in many cases regarding the shower reconstruction . for more detailed studies , however , the spatial spread of particles in the shower has to be taken into account .",
    "this is especially important for nearby showers , where the shower image , i.e.  the angular distribution of light recorded by a fluorescence detector ( fd ) , may be larger than the detector resolution .",
    "the image of a shower has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that for a disk - like distribution of the light emitted around the shower axis , the shower image has a circular shape , even when viewed perpendicular to the shower axis .",
    "analytical studies including lateral particle distributions parameterized by the nishimura - kamata - greisen ( nkg ) function or estimates based on average particle distributions taken from corsika  @xcite were discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite , respectively .    in this paper , detailed monte carlo simulations of the shower image based on the spatial energy deposit distributions of individual showers are performed . by using the energy deposit of the shower particles as calculated by corsika  @xcite",
    ", the previous simplified assumption of a constant fluorescence yield per particle is avoided . assuming a proportionality between the fluorescence yield and ionization density , the light emitted by each segment of the shower is determined .",
    "a concept is developed to treat the shower as a three - dimensional object , additionally taking into account the time information on photons arriving at the fd .",
    "in contrast to previous analytical studies , shower fluctuations as predicted by the shower simulation code are preserved and studied .",
    "propagation of the light towards the detector , including light attenuation and scattering in the atmosphere is simulated , so that the photon flux at the detector is calculated .",
    "the resulting distribution of photons arriving simultaneously at the detector , i.e. the shower image , is compared to results obtained by using the nkg approximation of particle distribution in the shower .",
    "the comparison is performed for different shower energies and different primary particles . in particular , it is checked whether the shower width depends on the primary particle type .",
    "+   + the plan of the paper is the following : definition of the shower width and algorithms of fluorescence light production are described in section 2 . in section 3 the size of shower image in the nkg and corsika approaches",
    "is calculated and its dependence on primary energy , zenith angle and primary particle is discussed .",
    "conclusions are given in section 4 .",
    "given an optical imaging system for recording the light emitted by a shower , the shower width is defined as the minimum angular diameter @xmath0 of the image spot containing a certain fraction @xmath1 of the total light recorded by the fd .",
    "the image is considered to be recorded instantaneously , i.e.  with an integration time such that the corresponding angular shower movement is well below the angular resolution of the detector .",
    "four main components of light contribution can be distinguished : ( i ) fluorescence light , with isotropic emission ; ( ii ) direct cherenkov radiation , emitted primarily in the forward direction ; ( iii ) rayleigh - scattered cherenkov light ; ( iv ) mie - scattered cherenkov light .",
    "the relative contributions of these components depend on the geometry of the shower with respect to the detector  @xcite , but in most cases the fluorescence light dominates the recorded signal . assuming only minor effects on the shower width by absorption and scattering processes during the fluorescence light propagation from the shower to the detector , the light fraction @xmath1 is mainly determined by the corresponding light fraction @xmath2 emitted around the shower axis @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the ( normalized ) lateral distribution of fluorescence light emitted .",
    "the main task is therefore to derive @xmath4 , which is also referred to as the shape function , since the brightness distribution of the shower image depends on the shape of @xmath4 .",
    "the shape functions in different methods of evaluating fluorescence light production described in the following , i.e.  in the nkg and corsika approach , and for different primary particle types in the corsika approach will be compared .",
    "photon propagation towards the detector is simulated based on the ` hybrid_fadc ` simulation software  @xcite , including rayleigh scattering on air molecules and mie scattering on aerosols .",
    "the final shower image is constructed by recording the photons that arrive simultaneously at the detector  @xcite .",
    "these photons that form an instantaneous image of the shower , originate from a range of shower development stages .",
    "thus , for a precise description of the shower image , we need to take into account also the geometrical time delays of the photons coming from these stages , as will be discussed later .",
    "since this work is intended as a general study , the resulting photon distribution after light propagation is assumed to be recorded by an ideal detector .",
    "possible effects of specific detector conditions such as spatial resolution or trigger thresholds will also be commented on , however .",
    "investigations specific to the fluorescence detectors of the pierre auger observatory are described in ref .",
    "@xcite      as the shower develops in the atmosphere , it dissipates most of its energy by exciting and ionizing air molecules along its path . from de - excitation , uv radiation",
    "is emitted with a spectrum peaked between 300 and 400 nm ( three major lines at 337.1 nm , 357.7 nm , 391.4 nm ) .",
    "measurements have shown that the variation of the fluorescence yield @xmath5 , i.e.  the number of photons emitted per unit length along a charged particle track , as a function of altitude is quite small for electrons of constant energy .",
    "for example , the measured fluorescence yield of an 80  mev electron varies by less than 12% around an average value of 4.8  photons / m over an effective altitude range of 20  km in the atmosphere  @xcite .",
    "this motivates to some extent the use of a constant , average fluorescence yield per shower particle , as will be described in the nkg approach ( section [ nkg - prod ] ) .",
    "+   + on the other hand , since the fluorescence light is induced by ionizing and exciting the molecules of the ambient air , the fluorescence yield is expected to depend on the ionization density along a charged particle track  @xcite .",
    "most shower particles contributing to the energy deposit in air have kinetic energies from sub - mev up to several hundred mev  @xcite which is in the energy range of considerable dependence of ionization density on particle energy . as an example",
    ", a measurement of the air fluorescence yield  @xcite between 300 and 400  nm at pressure 760  mm  hg is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the solid line represents the electron energy loss @xmath6 as a function of the electron energy .",
    "the minimum of this curve corresponds to 1.4 mev electrons with energy loss @xmath7  mev / g@xmath8 and fluorescence yield @xmath9 photons per meter .",
    "we note that @xmath6 increases by about @xmath10 for energies from 1.0 mev to 100 mev , so the energy spectrum of electrons in a shower and its variations with atmospheric depth should be taken into account for an accurate determination of the fluorescence emission of the shower . therefore to obtain a more realistic simulation of the spatial distribution of light production , the distribution of the energy deposit in the shower is used in the corsika approach ( section [ cor - prod ] ) , where additionally the temperature and density dependence of the fluorescence yield is taken into account .      in the usual treatment that was also used in a previous study of the shower image @xcite ,",
    "the fluorescence light emitted by a shower is calculated from @xcite : @xmath11\\ ] ]    where @xmath5 is a constant value of total fluorescence yield .",
    "the total number of particles @xmath12 is given by the gaisser - hillas function  @xcite    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the number of particles at shower maximum given by  @xcite @xmath15}{10 ^ 9}\\right)^{1.010}*10^{9}\\ ] ] and @xmath16 is density of electrons in the shower given by the nishimura - kamata - greisen ( nkg ) formula  @xcite @xmath17    @xmath18 is the atmospheric slant depth , @xmath19 the depth of first interaction , @xmath20 the depth of shower maximum , @xmath21 the hadronic interaction length in air ( commonly fixed to a value of @xmath22 g/@xmath23 ) , @xmath24 the shower age parameter ( @xmath25 at shower maximum ) and @xmath26 the molire radius .",
    "the molire radius is a natural transverse scale set by multiple scattering , and it determines the lateral spread of the shower .",
    "since the electron radiation length ( the cascade unit ) in air depends on temperature and pressure , the molire radius varies along the shower path .",
    "the distribution of particles in a shower at a given depth depends on the history of the changes of @xmath26 along the shower path rather than on the local @xmath26 value at this depth . to take this into account",
    ", one uses the @xmath26 value calculated at @xmath27 cascade units above the current depth @xcite :    @xmath28=272.5\\frac{t[\\mbox{k}](\\frac{p [ \\mbox{mb}]-73.94 \\cos\\theta}{p[\\mbox{mb}]})^{1./5.25588}}{p[\\mbox{mb}]-73.94 \\cos\\theta}.\\ ] ]    in the nkg approach we keep a constant value of fluorescence yield @xmath29 photons per meter , as used by the hires group  @xcite .",

    ", the energy loss @xmath6 of the shower particles is calculated in detail , taking into account also the contribution of particles below the simulation energy threshold  @xcite .",
    "we extended the code to obtain a spatial distribution of the energy deposit .",
    "this offers the possibility to construct a shower simulation chain which allows the comparison of quantities very close to the measured ones , e.g.  photon flux or distribution of light received at the detector or even per pixel as a function of time .",
    "in particular , shower - to - shower fluctuations generated by corsika are preserved in this way .",
    "the adopted air shower simulation part of the simulation chain is illustrated in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "a two - dimensional energy deposit distribution around the shower axis is stored in histograms during the simulation process for different atmospheric depths . by interpolation between the different atmospheric levels , a complete description of the spatial energy deposit distribution of the shower , taking into account also the geometrical time delays , is achieved .",

    "it can be seen that these shape functions are almost identical . some differences between vertical and inclined showers",
    "are seen only at distances to shower axis larger than @xmath104 m. the differences are due to changes of the molire radius with altitude : a larger zenith angle of the shower implies a higher position of the shower maximum and in consequence a larger value of the molire radius .",
    "since the molire radius determines the lateral spread of particles in the shower , for inclined showers the shape function @xmath100 becomes broader .",
    "a similar effect can be observed for showers with the same geometry , but different energies ( showers with lower energy have a higher position of the maximum and also a larger molire radius ) but in these cases the differences are much smaller .    in the nkg approach the size of the shower image @xmath41",
    "is connected to the width of the shape function of particle density @xmath100 and can be calculated at shower maximum using eq .",

    "it is seen that 90% ( 67% ) of fluorescence light emitted ( i.e. of shower particles ) are found within distances about 160 m ( 58 m ) around shower axis for vertical showers and about 190 m ( 70 m ) for inclined showers .",
    "the corresponding angular width of fluorescence light distributions at the detector , positioned for instance at @xmath106 km , in these cases is about 5.7@xmath76 ( 2@xmath76 ) for vertical showers and 7.0@xmath76 ( 2.6@xmath76 ) for inclined showers . in table  2 the sizes of shower image containing 90% and 67% of the signal according to formula ( [ eq - nkgshw ] )",
    "are listed .",
    "there is about 5% difference in the image spot size of showers with the same zenith angle but different energy , and about 19% between inclined and vertical showers . in figure  [ fig3]c the dependence of shower image versus @xmath40 in the nkg approach",
    "the @xmath107 spot size exceeds @xmath108 for vertical ( inclined ) showers at distances smaller than 12 km ( 14.5 km ) . with typical fd pixel resolution of @xmath69@xmath108",
    ", the shower image will cover more than one pixel at these distances .",
    "for a correct primary energy determination of these events , the fluorescence light in the neighboring pixels has to be taken into account .",
    "for example , at @xmath106 km the fraction of light outside the circle corresponding to pixel field of view ( @xmath108 in diameter ) is about 40% , as marked by the vertical dashed line in figure  [ fig3]b , but only about 10% if the @xmath40 increases 4 times ( increasing @xmath40 leads to proportional decreasing of image size ) .",
    "neglecting this effect would result in a significant underestimation of the reconstructed primary energy , especially for nearby showers .",
    "the analysis of figure  [ fig3 ] and table  2 leads to the following conclusion : in case of the nkg approximation the size of the shower image is independent of the primary energy for showers at the same development stage and geometry .",
    "in other words , the same molire radius and shower age imply the same shape of @xmath100 function and in consequence lead to the same spot size of the shower image .    in the above estimation of shower image",
    "we have neglected the influence of rayleigh- and mie - scattered and direct cherenkov light distribution on the shower image size . to estimate this effect ,",
    "relative differences between shower images obtained using these additional contributions to the fluorescence flux with respect to fluorescence only are shown in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "the additional contributions to the fluorescence light increase the image size on average by about 7% ( 3% ) within the image size containing 90% ( 67% ) of light and these changes of shower image size slightly depend on @xmath40 .",
    "these changes can be well understood if we take into account the rayleigh scattering , which is the second dominant component in the total signal for the studied geometry .",
    "it is well known that rayleigh scattering probability is proportional to @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the angle between the direction of photon emission and the direction towards the fd .",
    "since @xmath110 increases for a vertical shower with increasing @xmath40 , so the rayleigh scattering probability and also contribution of rayleigh - scattered light to the shower image will be smaller .",
    "we note from figure  [ fig4 ] that this contribution depends on the fraction of light considered : it is larger when we study 90% of light than for 67% .",
    "this means that in the `` center '' of shower image fluorescence dominates , but it is less in the `` tail '' .",
    "the shower image in the scattered light is therefore larger , although the `` scattered '' contribution is small for the considered geometries . in the following we concentrate on the main component , the unscattered fluorescence light .      in this section",
    "we study the differences between the calculated lateral distributions of energy deposit in the nkg and corsika approaches and their influence on the shower image .",
    "we assume that fluorescence emmision dominates the received signal and that the distribution of light emitted by the shower is proportional to the distribution of energy deposit : @xmath111 . for this purpose , in figure  [ fig5]a",
    "we show the calculated lateral distributions of the energy deposit versus the distances to the shower axis at any point of surface s ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ) . in case of the nkg approximation ,",
    "the lateral density of energy deposit ( dashed line ) is calculated using the following formula : @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the energy loss of an electron corresponding to a constant value of the average fluorescence yield @xmath29 photons per meter .    in case of the corsika approach ,",
    "the energy deposit density ( solid line in figure  [ fig5]a ) was obtained using the two - dimensional histogram of @xmath6 .",
    "it is seen that the density of energy deposit obtained using corsika histograms becomes larger than nkg at distances to shower axis smaller than 45 m. in the nkg approximation , it is assumed that all particles lose the same amount of energy and that the shape of the lateral distribution of energy deposit has the same ( nkg ) functional form .",
    "plots in figures  [ fig5]b and  [ fig5]c show that these assumptions are not strictly valid . in figure",
    "[ fig5]b we see that the particle density calculated from the nkg formula ( dashed line ) is different from the particle density from corsika ( solid line ) .",
    "the difference in the lateral distribution of energy deposit is mainly caused by this difference in the lateral particle distribution . a minor additional effect on the shape function",
    "is given by the average energy loss per particle . in figure",
    "[ fig5]c the calculated relative difference @xmath114 between average energy losses of electrons @xmath115 in corsika and nkg approach is shown .",
    "the average corsika energy loss is always larger than energy loss in the nkg approach and the differences varies with distance from shower axis .",
    "this reflects a variation of the distribution of kinetic energy of particles around the shower axis , with more energetic particles being closer to the axis .",
    "qualitatively , a narrower lateral particle distribution is expected for the corsika proton events , as the electromagnetic component is permanently fed from high - energy hadrons collimated around the axis .",
    "the nkg approximation , on the contrary , rather reflects a purely electromagnetic shower behavior . in figure  [ fig6]a ,",
    "the normalized distribution of energy deposit from figure  [ fig5]a ( the shape function of energy deposit @xmath116 ) in the nkg and corsika approximations are shown .",
    "we see that for distance to shower axis smaller than 25 m the corsika shape function becomes considerably larger than the nkg one .",
    "fitting corsika data with a nkg - type function with fixed age @xmath25 leads to an effective value of the molire radius @xmath117 m. this value is about 50% smaller than the original molire radius ( @xmath118 m ) in the nkg approach .",
    "this implies that the differences in the nkg and corsika approaches will lead to different sizes of shower image . to estimate this difference more precisely ,",

    "for instance , in case of proton showers @xmath144 varies by about 2% between @xmath71 and @xmath127 eev and the @xmath24 parameter varies by about 9% .",
    "this means that at first approximation the shape of energy deposit density around the shower maximum seems to be almost independent of energy , although the amount of total energy deposit changes .",
    "on the other hand , when we compare @xmath24 and @xmath144 for showers with the same energy but different primary , the differences are much larger . on the basis of figure  [ fig8 ]",
    ", one expects differences in the size of shower image for the same energy , but different primary . to study this effect",
    "more precisely , we show in figure  [ fig9]b the integral of energy deposit @xmath119 for iron and proton shape function at 10 eev .",
    "it can be seen that 90% of energy deposit falls within 125 m from the shower axis in case of proton shower , and within 149 m for iron shower .",
    "the image spot size is about 4.5@xmath76 and 5.4@xmath76 for proton and iron , respectively .",
    "a fit of a functional form as given by eq .",
    "[ eq - fab ] to the fraction of energy deposit in iron showers leads to @xmath146 m and @xmath147 and in proton showers @xmath148 m and @xmath149 .",
    "thus , the size of shower image for iron showers @xmath150 and proton one @xmath151 can be calculated using formula ( 18 ) with appropriate values of parameters ; an example is shown in figure  [ fig9]c .",
    "the size of iron shower image is always larger by about 13% than proton one for all distances . in figure  [ fig9]d the relative difference @xmath152 between iron and proton shower image size versus fraction of light",
    "is presented .",
    "it can be seen that differences in the image spot size between iron and proton increase when we take into account a larger fraction of the energy deposit .",
    "we note that the difference @xmath153 was calculated assuming the same distance to the shower , but not the same altitude of the proton and iron shower maximum .",
    "it should therefore be checked if the observed difference between iron and proton image is only an atmospheric effect given by the different local value of @xmath26 in air .",
    "this atmospheric effect can be estimated using the molire radius for proton and iron showers at their maxima and can be calculated using the equation @xmath154 . since the molire radius for iron @xmath155 m and for proton @xmath156 m ,",
    "the relative difference in the shower image due to the atmospheric effect is @xmath157 .",
    "thus , half of the difference between the primaries visible in @xmath153 presented in figure  [ fig9]d is caused by this atmospheric effect .    in figure  [ fig10 ] the influence of fluctuations in proton and iron shower shape function of energy deposit",
    "are presented .",
    "fluctuations in proton shower profile lead to changes in the size of the shower image of about @xmath158 . however , the image of a proton shower is always smaller than iron shower image .",
    "this section summarizes results presented until now with one modification : we show the shower image including all light components .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] shows the size of the shower image @xmath0 containing @xmath107 or @xmath159 of light as a function of distance @xmath40 from the fd to the shower , for showers with different core distance @xmath81 .",
    "a comparison of the shower image derived using the two - dimensional corsika histograms and that given by the nkg function is made for two different shower energies .",
    "it is evident that the image size in the shower maximum is independent of energy in the nkg approximation and that the nkg approximation leads to larger sizes of shower image than those derived from corsika .",
    "moreover , for a shower with higher energy the image size from corsika is slightly smaller than the size at lower energy .",
    "these differences can be understood when we take into account the variation of the shape function in these cases , which were discussed earlier and shown in figures  [ fig3]a , [ fig6]a and [ fig99]a .",
    "for example , figure  [ fig99]a shows that the values of the shape function at @xmath127 eev are larger than those at @xmath71 eev at distances to the shower axis smaller than 10 m. since we calculate the widths of these functions at distances corresponding to @xmath107 or @xmath160 of the total signal , we expect that the width at the higher energy will be smaller .",
    "a similar effect is observed when one compares the shape functions in the nkg and corsika approximations , ( see figure  [ fig6]a ) . in this case one",
    "expects that the width of the shape function in the nkg approximation will be larger than that derived from corsika . in case of the nkg approximation ,",
    "the changes of the shape functions with energy are negligible , as seen in figure  [ fig3]a ; the observed small differences are only due to different distances to the shower .",
    "shower image simulations more accurate than available until now are presented , which incorporate a more realistic distribution of fluorescence light emitted by the shower .",
    "the image simulations are based on distributions of energy deposited by the shower in air as derived from corsika .",
    "a comparison of the size of the shower image obtained using corsika and that given by the nkg function was made for different energies and primary particles . to a first approximation , the results of these two completely independent methods ( analytical versus monte carlo ) show quite reasonable agreement .    the image spot size derived from corsika is smaller by about 15% compared to the nkg approximation .",
    "this difference is mainly due to the differences in lateral particle distributions in the nkg and corsika approximation .",
    "the energy deposit distribution from corsika leads to a dependence of the size of shower image on the primary particle , so that studies of the shower image may be helpful for the primary particle identification .    _",
