    "as it is well known , the great gauss initiated not only big mathematical theories , but also was an author of many small mathematical `` gems '' in number theory , arithmetic and algebra , real and complex analysis , probability theory , classical mechanics and particularly in geometry .",
    "one of his beloved topics in elementary geometry were ordinary plane polygons .",
    "not only their constructions by ruler and compass , but also computing their areas . in this paper",
    "we discuss one of his less known and almost forgotten `` gems '' : the pentagon formula .",
    "we have not been aware of this formula until recently , when one of us ( d.s . ) bought wu s book @xcite , while being at the world congress of mathematicians in beijing in august 2002 .",

    "occasionally though , some authors discuss closely related problems , e.g.  @xcite , or also closely related monge formula , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "it this paper we offer several proofs of this beautiful formula for the area of a pentagon and show that , in fact , it is equivalent to the monge formula , which , in turn , is equivalent to the well known ptolemy formula @xmath0 , where @xmath1 are side lengths and @xmath2 diagonal lengths of a cyclic ( inscribed ) quadrilateral .    in words , the gauss pentagon formula says that to compute the area of a ( convex ) pentagon we do nt have to dissect , triangulate or integrate it , but only go around the pentagon and measure areas of its vertex triangles ( i.e.  triangles with three consecutive vertices ) .",
    "we shall also discuss extensions to hexagons etc .  and consider affine  regular polygons .",
    "our main result is the explicit robbins formula @xcite and @xcite for the area of a cyclic pentagon ( i.e.  a pentagon inscribed in a circle ) in terms of its side lengths .",
    "it is a consequence of the ptolemy formula , and that s the reason why we included it here . in this way",
    "we continue the sequence : the heron formula ( 1 .",

    "note that the gauss formula ( [ f : g ] ) and the monge formula ( [ f : m ] ) are , in fact , equivalent .",
