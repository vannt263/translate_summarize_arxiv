    "the strong interaction between the quarks is described by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , a constitutive part of the standard model of elementary particle physics .",
    "qcd develops a strong coupling constant at the hadronic mass scale and thus , perturbation theory can not be applied .",
    "the only known non - perturbative ab - initio method is to simulate qcd on a 4-dimensional space - time lattice by use of monte carlo methods as known from statistical physics",
    ".    one would think that lattice simulations of qcd have to take into account virtual loops from all six quark flavors , up ( u ) , down ( d ) , strange ( s ) , charm ( c ) bottom ( b ) , and top ( t ) .",
    "their masses span a wide range from about @xmath0 mev to about @xmath1 gev .",
    "scheme at a renormalization scale @xmath2 gev .",
    "the masses of the heavy quarks ( c , b , t ) are `` running '' masses determined at @xmath3 in the @xmath4 scheme @xcite . ]",
    "the masses of the three heavy quarks lie above the momentum scale set by dynamical chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the qcd lagrangian is chirally symmetric for vanishing quark masses .",
    "chiral symmetry is explicitly broken by the quark masses and spontaneously by the dynamics . for light quarks , ( u ,",
    "d , s ) , dynamical breaking dominates , as signaled by zero mass goldstone bosons , , the pion octet .",
    "supposedly only the light quarks contribute with virtual loops ; the contributions of the heavier ones are assumed to be negligible .    a straightforward lattice qcd simulation including u , d , and s   is difficult : on one hand , u  and d  are very light . as we know from chiral perturbation theory , the square of the pion mass is proportional to the quark mass @xcite",
    ". therefore , the pion acquires a small mass ,  a large correlation length , @xmath5 , for u  and d  masses approaching the chiral limit , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 denotes the lattice spacing .",
    "the lattice volume must be larger by more than one order of magnitude than possible today to reach physical parameter values for @xmath6 and @xmath9 .",
    "hence , one has to recourse to extrapolations using results of simulations at artificial parameters for @xmath6 and @xmath9 and small lattices , far off the chiral limit .",
    "these difficulties go along with an increasing condition number of the fermionic matrix @xmath10 , therefore its inversion suffers from critical slowing down approaching the chiral limit @xcite .    on the other hand , until recently , the only exact simulation algorithm for qcd with dynamical fermions was the hybrid monte carlo algorithm ( hmc ) @xcite .",
    "the benefits of hmc in reducing the computational complexity are achieved by treating the fermionic determinants as a stochastic estimate using gaussian random fields @xcite , with the advantage , that instead of computing the determinant , only the solution of a linear system is required . for this approach",
    "the fermion matrix @xmath10 must be hermitian positive definite ( _ hpd _ ) .",
    "the wilson fermion discretization of the fermionic sector of qcd describes single flavors @xcite , in contrast to staggered fermions that represent four fermions , intermixed in spin - flavor space .",
    "unfortunately , wilson fermions must violate chiral symmetry , see ref .",
    "@xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the wilson fermion matrix is complex non - normal and thus can not be included in the hmc scheme . to avoid this problem ,",
    "one usually simulates two mass degenerate light quarks , an approximation justified by the fact that both quarks , u  and d , are light and close in mass compared to the next heavier one , s. the product of two mass degenerate determinants indeed amounts to an _ hpd _  matrix , that can be simulated by the hmc . the minor price to pay",
    "is that the two light quarks are mass - degenerate , the major price is that the s  quark is not included in the simulation .",
    "there are attempts to evaluate operators , that contain the s  quark , by application of a `` partially quenched analysis '' @xcite .",
    "the pqa extrapolates only one of the valence quarks towards the chiral limit and holds the other one at the mass of the s  quark  of course within the light mass - degenerate u - d - sea .",
    "pqa , however , leads to inconsistencies : the so - called j - parameter does not acquire its physical value @xcite .",
    "one can try to employ an approximate one - flavor determinant representation .",
    "such simulations , however , are plagued by systematic uncertainties , as one has to recourse to non - exact simulation algorithms like the hybrid molecular dynamics algorithm @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in the framework of the multi - boson algorithm @xcite , one can define an exact single flavor simulation scheme for wilson fermions @xcite . here",
    "many additional bosonic auxiliary fields are required , and it is not clear if the method would be well suited for more complicated actions or allows to exploit sophisticated preconditioning .    in this paper , we propose to include the wilson fermion determinant into hmc such that a single quark can be described .",
    "we show that the fermionic determinant can be written as a product of the determinants of two _ hpd",
    "_  matrices .",
    "this is achieved by the representation of the fermion matrix via its schur complement .",
    "both determinants can be treated by the hybrid monte carlo in the standard manner .",
    "there are , however , some caveats : one of the two matrices involves the inverse of the other one . as a consequence , a nested inversion must be carried out .",
    "we propose to use a uzawa - like inverter which allows to solve the nested system within one iterative process .",
    "a second difficulty stems from the initialization of the fermion action in the hmc algorithm : since we have a single flavor system , we have to compute a square root at the beginning of a hmc trajectory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : notations ] we introduce the basics of lattice qcd and will discuss the difficulties simulating single flavors of wilson fermions by the hmc . in section [ sec : transform ] we give the transformation of the fermion matrix using the schur complement , in section [ sec : hmc ] we present the non - mass - degenerate hmc for wilson fermions along with a discussion of numerical problems . in section [ sec : uzawa ] , we introduce an algorithm that can compute the nested inversion in one iterative process .",
    "finally , we summarize and give an outlook .",
    "the action of lattice qcd is the sum of a gauge part ( which is not relevant for the following ) and a fermionic part : @xmath11:=s_g[u]+\\sum_{{\\sf x},{\\sf y},a , b,\\alpha,\\beta}\\bar\\psi^{a\\atop\\alpha}_{\\sf x } \\,m^{a , b\\atop \\alpha,\\beta}_{{\\sf x},\\sf y}\\,\\psi^{b\\atop \\beta}_{\\sf y}.\\]]@xmath12 is 4-dimensional volume in euclidean space .",
    "the full matrix is a tensor product with @xmath13 su(3 ) matrices @xmath14 ( color ) and four @xmath15 matrices @xmath16 ( dirac spin ) , hence @xmath17here the indices @xmath18 an @xmath19 stands for the 4-dimensional coordinates , @xmath8 and @xmath20 denote color space and @xmath21 and @xmath22 dirac space indices .",
    "the fermion fields @xmath23 are _ grassmann _ variables .",
    "therefore , the grassmann integral of the exponential of the fermionic part of the action , , the fermionic part of the path integral , can be carried out , @xmath24[d \\bar\\psi]\\,e^{-\\bar\\psi\\,m\\psi}=\\det(m),\\]]to yield the determinant of @xmath10 for arbitrary complex @xmath10 .",
    "wilson fermions are defined by the interaction matrix @xmath25    the dirac matrices in euclidean space satisfy the anti - commutator relations @xmath26it is important for the following considerations to work with the chiral representation of the dirac matrices , as given in the appendix [ chiralapp ] . in this representation , @xmath27 , defined as the product @xmath28 ,",
    "is diagonal .",
    "@xmath10 is a complex non - hermitian matrix which moreover is not normal , , @xmath29thus @xmath10 can not be diagonalized by a unitary transformation . at most , it might be diagonalizable by a similarity transformation .",
    "however , @xmath10 exhibits the so - called @xmath27-symmetry or @xmath27-hermiticity : @xmath30therefore , the matrix @xmath31is hermitian .",
    "we can immediately read off the chiral representation of the dirac matrices , see the appendix , that , for @xmath32 , @xmath33 exhibits an equal number of positive and negative eigenvalues . in general",
    ", @xmath33 is indefinite .",
    "the matrix @xmath34 is _",
    "hpd_. since the determinant of @xmath34 represents two mass degenerate fermion flavors , @xmath35the two flavor situation is ideal for hmc simulations .",
    "being unitary diagonalizable it can be represented by a gaussian integral over complex fields @xmath36 :    @xmath37[d\\phi^ * ] e^{-\\phi^{\\dagger}\\big(m^{\\dagger}m\\big)^{-1}\\phi}.\\ ] ]    for the single flavor @xmath10 , such a simple construction fails even for the situation @xmath38 where @xmath10 is positive definite , because the jacobian of the similarity transform  if the diagonalization is feasible at all  is not equal to 1 .    on the other hand , @xmath39but , @xmath33 is indefinite . therefore , a gaussian integral representation for its determinant does not exist .",
    "we conclude that so far there is no direct way to include individual flavors within the hmc algorithm .",
    "let s consider the hermitian matrix @xmath33 with the dirac matrices given in the chiral representation of appendix [ chiralapp ] .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath33 in the chiral representation is given by @xmath40here , the bold face @xmath41 represents a unit matrix in @xmath42 spin space .",

    ", we might include the dynamics of the @xmath66 fields into hmc avoiding the expensive heat bath step for @xmath59 , similar to the @xmath76-algorithm of ref .",
    "the nested inversion within the solution of @xmath77 has to be carried out at each molecular dynamics time step of hmc as well as in the computation of the action . by uzawa iterations",
    "@xcite we avoid the solution of the linear system represented by @xmath55 within each iteration step of the @xmath59 iteration .    the problem to solve is given by : @xmath78 with @xmath79 .",

    "the uzawa iteration required about 610 steps in comparison .",
    "the overall improvement for this setting is about a factor of 10 . of course , these results are very preliminary and have to be confirmed for other values of @xmath54 and @xmath22 with realistic hmc simulations",
    ". it would also be desirable to implement the uzawa scheme within krylov subspace solvers .",

    ", one finds @xmath95 .",
    "we have , so far , investigated the lowest lying eigenvalues of @xmath55 for the interacting case : on a @xmath96 configuration , taken from the sesam ensembles at @xmath97 and @xmath98 , we found for the inverse of the critical eigenvalue of @xmath43 , @xmath99 .",
    "the critical @xmath54 of @xmath43 is reached for a @xmath54-value being smaller than the critical @xmath54 value of the wilson matrix .",
    "therefore , the singularity might be a barrier screening the approach to the chiral limit .",
    "these questions have to be clarified in an actual hmc simulation with one - flavor qcd .",
    "the determinant of the wilson fermion matrix is equivalent to the product of the determinants of two hermitian positive definite matrices .",
