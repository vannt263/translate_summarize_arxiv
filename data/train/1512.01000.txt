    "the formation scenario of wr bubbles was refined in the 90s by the works presented by @xcite and @xcite . in this scenario",
    "the star evolves from the main - sequence ( ms ) phase to a red supergiant ( rsg ) or luminous blue variable ( lbv ) . in the rsg / lbv phase",
    "the star loses its envelope into the interstellar medium ( ism ) via a copious , slow and dense wind ( @xmath11=10100  km  s@xmath6 and @xmath1210@xmath1310@xmath14  m@xmath10  yr@xmath6 ) .",
    "when the star evolves to the wr phase , it develops a powerful wind ( @xmath11=10002500  km  s@xmath6 and @xmath1510@xmath16  m@xmath10  yr@xmath6 ) and a strong ionizing photon flux that interact with the circumstellar material ( csm ) , creating the wr nebula .",
    "the wind - wind interaction described above is thought to produce the so - called adiabatically - shocked hot bubble .",
    "the expected plasma temperature of this hot bubble is directly related to the terminal wind velocity as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the bolztmann constant and @xmath19 is the mean particle mass for fully ionized gas ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the high - spatial resolution of the _ chandra _ acis observations presented by @xcite showed that the higher temperature component in the _ suzaku _ spectrum was due to contamination by point - like sources projected along the line of sight of the nebula not resolved by those observations .",
    "they concluded that a two - temperature plasma model of @xmath261.4@xmath110@xmath2  k and @xmath277.4@xmath110@xmath2  k described more accurately the spectral properties of the hot gas inside ngc6888 .",
    "furthermore , @xcite argued that there was an additional component in the spatial distribution of the x - ray - emitting gas in ngc6888 toward the northwest blowout observed in [ oiii ] optical narrowband and mid - infrared images .",

    "to proceed with the study of the physical properties of the x - ray - emitting gas in ngc6888 , we have extracted x - ray spectra from different regions of this nebula . in order to identify periods of high - background levels , we created light curves binning the data over 100  s for each of the epic cameras in the 1012  kev energy band .",
    "background was considered high for count rate values over 1.0 counts  s@xmath6 and 0.2 counts  s@xmath6 for the pn and mos cameras , respectively .",
    "the net exposure times after excising bad periods of time are 48.8 ks , 63.8 ks , and 64.9 ks for the pn , mos1 , and mos2 cameras respectively .    in order to study the spectral variations within regions in ngc6888 , we have defined several polygonal apertures as shown in figure  3 .",

    "no significant emission is detected at energies above 1.5 kev .",
    "the main spectral feature that peaks at 0.5 kev can be associated to the n   vii 24.8   emission line , while the secondary peak can be attributed to the fe complex and to ne  ix lines .",
