    "one of the discrepancies between the theory and the experiments are seen in their quantitative values of the critical impurity concentration where oo disappears . some of the reasons of this discrepancy may be attributed to the anharmonic jt coupling and the long - range ps interactions due to the spring constants beyond the nn ions and so on , both of which are not taken into account in the present calculation .",
    "the former subject , i.e. the anharmonic jt coupling , induces the anisotropy in a bottom of the adiabatic potential of the @xmath301 plane , and prevents the ps tilting around impurity sites .",
    "this effect on the reduction of @xmath216 was studied briefly in ref .  .",
    "it was shown that , in the realistic parameter values , the reduction of @xmath216 becomes moderate by the anharmonic coupling , but it is still steeper than that in dilute magnets .",
    "another factor which may explains the discrepancy between the theory and the experiments is the quantum aspect for the orbital degree of freedom . in the results obtained by the quantum ce method as shown in fig .",
    "[ egphase ] , the critical @xmath19 for @xmath302 is larger than the results by other two classical calculations for the orbital model and is close to the experimental value of @xmath18 . this may be due to the fact that quantum fluctuation in low temperatures weakens the low dimensional character in the oo state and prevents a collapse of oo against dilution .",
    "this kind of quantum effects in the dilute orbital system was examined by the present authors in the two dimensional quantum orbital model .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the reduction of @xmath216 due to dilution is weaker than that in the classical orbital model .",
