    "over the past few decades , a considerable number of studies has been conducted on the neutrino oscillation with a great success of measuring neutrino mixing angles .",
    "but , some experiments for the neutrino oscillation revealed more or less disagreements with the three - flavor neutrino model , which termed as the neutrino anomalies , as reported in lsnd@xcite , miniboone@xcite , reactor experiments@xcite and gallium experiments@xcite .",
    "one of the approaches for explaining the neutrino anomalies is to presume the existence of the hypothetical fourth neutrino , which is called as sterile neutrino , because the sterile neutrino does not interact with other particles excepting through a mixing with active neutrinos .    very recently , the icecube experiment reported a new constrained region for the parameter space of the mixing angle and the mass - squared differences for the @xmath2 mass scale sterile neutrino @xcite , in which the parameter space by previous lsnd and miniboone data are largely excluded .",
    "but , if we recollect that @xmath3 cosmological sterile neutrino is still under discussion for a dark matter candidate and the relic neutrino search is being considered , it would be an interesting discussion to consider effects of the sterile neutrino in the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) epoch and deduce related parameters from the observational data with the comparison to the icecube experimental data analysis .    among many scenarios of the sterile neutrino , ps _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite assumed that the sterile neutrino is a gauge - singlet particle and can travel on or off our 3 + 1 dimensional brane embedded in a large extra dimension bulk similarly to the graviton in the brane - world cosmology . according to the cosmology , ordinary matter fields",
    "are confined to a three - dimensional space in the high dimensional bulk .",
    "originally , the brane - world cosmology was suggested to explain the hierarchy problem , the large scale difference between the standard model force and the gravity@xcite .",
    "randall and sundrum suggested a new solution of the hierarchy problem by introducing noncompact extra dimensions@xcite . ref .",
    "@xcite suggested a model , in which a sterile neutrino can propagate in the bulk space similarly to the graviton .",
    "they derived a new formula of resonant active - sterile neutrino oscillation and found an allowed region of the resonance energy from the comparison to available experimental data .",
    "if the production rate of this kind of sterile neutrino is always smaller than the cosmic expansion rate , the abundance of the sterile neutrino never reaches the equilibrium value .",
    "the effect of the sterile neutrino on bbn is then completely negligible .",
    "this situation has been considered recently @xcite , and a parameter region where the sterile neutrino abundance is extremely small has been searched by an analytical estimate . however , as shown in this paper , observational constraints on primordial abundances do not exclude the situation that the sterile neutrino is abundantly produced in thermal bath and its abundance attains the equilibrium value in the early universe . furthermore , the observational abundance of @xmath4he is possibly explained by the effect of the sterile neutrino better than in standard bbn model , as argued in this paper .    in this study",
    ", we adopt the same model as ref .",
    "@xcite and study effects of a sterile neutrino in an extra - dimensional universe by a numerical bbn calculation in detail .",
    "since the primordial element abundances can be measured with a good precision by the recent great advent of astrophysical spectroscopic observations , the bbn study turns out to be a useful test bed for deriving the cosmological constraints on nonstandard models .",
    "for example , some parameters in the modified gravity models , such as @xmath5 and @xmath6 gravity , were constrained in detail @xcite .",
    "in addition , effects of some supersymmetric ( susy ) particles in the early universe have been investigated and parameters , i.e. , the lifetime and mass , can be constrained @xcite .",
    "we include effects of the extra dimensional sterile neutrino in the bbn epoch as follows .",
    "the cosmic expansion rate is modified by the large extra dimension @xcite as well as the energy density @xcite of the sterile neutrino traveling on or off our 3 + 1 dimensional brane .",
    "then the modified friedmann equation and the energy density of decoupled sterile neutrino may change the primordial element abundances . therefore , the parameters relevant to the extra dimension and the sterile neutrino can be constrained by using observational data of primordial light element abundances .",

    "the shorter cosmic time scale leads to the earlier freeze - out of the destruction reactions . subsequently , the larger final deuterium abundance is obtained .      since we include the sterile neutrino which has a finite mass @xmath43 , its energy density @xmath44 is added to the ordinary density in eq .. the total energy density is thus changed as @xmath45 where the first and the second terms indicate energy densities of standard model particles and sterile neutrinos , respectively .",

    "therefore , the sterile neutrino is decoupled at a temperature when the reaction rate of the sterile neutrino becomes relatively small .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom for the entropy @xmath59 in eq . is decreased at the lower temperature @xcite .",
    "the freeze - out abundance @xmath53 then becomes larger for larger mixing angle because the freeze - out occurs later .",
    "this dependence on @xmath72 is valid for any resonance energy parameters .",

    "the dependence is similar to the case for @xmath112 [ eq . ] .",
    "however , if the resonance energy is much larger than @xmath113 , the dependence on the resonance energy disappears and the value of @xmath53 depends only on the mixing angle .      finally , we discuss @xmath116 decoupling temperature in order to describe time evolution of energy density of the sterile neutrino during bbn .",
    "first , we define a parameter @xmath117 where @xmath49 and @xmath118 are temperatures of sterile neutrino and active neutrinos , respectively , for a fixed cosmic time .",
    "this ratio is unity before the decoupling of the sterile neutrino .",
    "after the decoupling , the temperatures can be different , and the ratio is smaller than 1 , in general .",
    "after active neutrino decoupling , the two temperatures have the same scaling with a scale factor of the universe .",

    "the second equality is derived from the evolution of the active neutrino temperature by taking into account the entropy conservation @xcite .",
    "this ratio is found to be constant between the initial temperature of bbn calculation , which is taken to be @xmath122 , and the active neutrino decoupling temperature @xmath123 , due to the following reason . in this temperature interval",
    ", numbers of degree of freedom for entropy does not change .",
    "therefore , both temperatures of the sterile and active neutrinos simply scale as @xmath124 .",
    "we then use this constant ratio in the bbn calculation .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows calculated ratio @xmath119 in the parameter plane of @xmath72 and @xmath85 .",
    "this ratio @xmath125 depends on @xmath72 and @xmath85 since the decoupling temperature of the sterile neutrino depends on its reaction rate determined by those parameters .",
    "the ratio is rapidly increased at a curved line . above the line",
    "the sterile neutrinos decouple after the quark - hadron transition , while below the line they decouple before the transition .",
    "if the transition occurred , then the degrees of freedom is rapidly decreased .",
    "therefore @xmath59 is rapidly decreased and the @xmath126 is rapidly increased according to eq .. in this calculation , we assumed that the quark - hadron transition occurred at @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the transition affects the energy density of the sterile neutrino through the @xmath126 parameter determining the averaged energy of the sterile neutrino during bbn epoch .     in the parameter plane of @xmath72 and @xmath85 [ gev ] .",

    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "if the mass of the sterile neutrino is larger than @xmath1741 mev , then it becomes non - relativistic in the bbn epoch .",
    "so the energy density of the sterile neutrino is proportional to its mass .",
