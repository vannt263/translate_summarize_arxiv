    "non - abelian fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) states are a new class of fqh states whose excitations carry non - abelian statistics.@xcite the internal order of non - abelian states is so different from the symmetry breaking orders that totally new approaches are needed to study them .",
    "since the very beginning , two very effective yet very different approaches were introduced ; one is based on conformal field theory@xcite and the other is based on projective construction.@xcite both approaches allow us to calculate non - abelian quasiparticles and edge states.@xcite the projective construction also allows us to calculate the effective bulk topological field theory for the non - abelian fqh states .",
    "this class of quantum states is proposed to be a medium for fault tolerant quantum computation.@xcite    however , it is non trivial to realize non - abelian states ; in particular , most observed fqh states are believed to be abelian fqh states . but",
    "by utilizing the special form of electron - electron interaction in the second landau level , a non - abelian fqh state , the moore - read pfaffian state,@xcite may be realized as the @xmath3 fqh state.@xcite the @xmath4 state may also be a non - abelian state@xcite , although more experimental studies are needed to be sure .    in this paper",
    ", we will study another possible mechanism for realizing non - abelian states , namely the possibility to make them in double layer systems .",
    "experimentally , the hierarchal fqh states observed in double systems are quite different from those in the first landau level .",
    "so there may be non - abelian fqh states in double - layer systems .    in general",
    ", double - layer fqh states contain a class of fractional exciton excitations .",
    "a fractional exciton ( f - exciton ) is formed by a pair of fractionally charged quasiparticle and quasihole in each layer .",
    "such a fractional exciton may carry fractional statistics .",
    "if we start with an abelian double - layer state , the condensation of fractional excitons may generate a non - abelian state .",
    "the condensation of fractional excitons and the resulting non - abelian moore - read pfaffian state has been studied for the @xmath5 double - layer state.@xcite such a phenomenon is closely related to the transition between the weak - pairing @xmath6-wave to strong pairing @xmath6-wave bcs superconductors.@xcite in this paper , we show that the fractional exciton condensation in the @xmath7 double - layer state generate the @xmath8 read - rezayi parafermion state .",
    "let us consider a double - layer quantum hall system of spin polarized electrons at filling fraction @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is odd .",
    "we will consider only the @xmath11 quantum ground states .",
    "first we assume the interlayer tunneling and interlayer interaction to be zero . in this case",
    "the electrons in the two layers form two independent @xmath12 laughlin states , which is denoted as @xmath13 state .",
    "such a state is a special case of more general @xmath14 double - layer states whose wave function is given by @xmath15 where the complex number @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) are electron coordinates in the first ( second ) layer .",
    "in this paper , we will also consider the situation where @xmath10 is even . in this case",
    ", electrons must carry bose statistics .",
    "so the bosonic `` electrons '' will form two independent @xmath12 laughlin states in the two layers for even @xmath10 .",
    "the wave function still has the form in .",
    "now let us still assume the interlayer tunneling to be zero , but increase the repulsive interaction between electrons in the two different layers .",
    "clearly , when the interlayer repulsive interaction is very strong , the electrons will all stay in one of the two layers and from a single - layer @xmath18 state .",
    "the single - layer @xmath18 state is a charge imbalanced state since the electron densities in the two layers are different .",
    "the charge imbalanced state spontaneous breaks the symmetry of exchanging the two layers .",
    "thus the state for small interlayer repulsion and the state for large interlayer repulsion have different symmetries and belong to different phases .",
    "this suggests that as we increase interlayer repulsion from zero , we induce a quantum phase transition at a critical interlayer repulsion .",
    "what is this quantum phase transition ?    to understand the phase transition ( or the instability of the @xmath13 state ) induced by interlayer repulsion , let us consider the following excitation in the @xmath13 state which is formed by a charge @xmath19 quasiparticle in one layer and a charge @xmath20 quasihole in the other layer .",
    "we will call such an excitation a fractionalized exciton ( f - exciton ) .",
    "clearly , the presence of a finite density of f - excitons will cause a charge imbalance between the two layers .",
    "thus a strong interlayer repulsion will generate many f - excitons and cause a charge imbalanced state such as the single - layer @xmath18 state .",
    "this consideration suggests that if we increase interlayer repulsion in the @xmath13 state , the energy gap for the f - excitons will be reduced .",
    "when the energy gap of the f - exciton is reduced to zero , the @xmath13 state will become unstable and a quantum phase transition will happen .",
    "such a quantum phase transition can be studied using the approach developed in . the effective theory for the transition",
    "is found to be a ginzburg - landau - chern - simons ( glcs ) theory @xmath21 such a low energy effective theory describes the critical point at the transition .",
    "we would like to make a few remarks : + ( a ) near the phase transition , both f - excitons and anti - f - excitons become gapless . this is why the effective glcs theory is relativistic .",
    "the field @xmath22 describes both f - excitons and anti - f - excitons .",
    "+ ( b ) the f - excitons obey fractional statistics with @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath24 gauge field @xmath25 with the chern - simons term is introduced to reproduce the fractional statistics .",
    "+ ( c ) the energy gap of the f - excitons is @xmath26 .",
    "+ ( d ) as we increase the interlayer repulsion from zero , @xmath27 will decrease . for large interlayer repulsion , @xmath27 will be reduced to a negative value , and cause a phase transition from the @xmath28 phase to @xmath29 phase .",
    "+ ( e ) we note that in the @xmath29 phase the densities of f - excitons and anti - f - excitons are equal .",
    "so both the @xmath28 phase and @xmath29 phases have an equal electron density in the two layers and are charge balanced states .",
    "the charge imbalanced state mentioned above will appear for even stronger interlayer repulsion .",
    "+     state , the low lying charge neutral excitations are the f - excitons .",
    "such dispersion for the f - excitons leads to the transition between the @xmath30 state and the charge @xmath31 laughlin state . at larger @xmath32 , the wigner crystal ( wc ) and a charge imbalanced state ( imb state ) may appear . ]    in the presence of inter - layer repulsion",
    ", the dispersion of the f - excitons may have several different possible forms .",
    "one possible dispersion relation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ nn0nt ] .",
    "the effective theory applies to such a situation .",
    "state , the low lying charge neutral excitations are the f - excitons .",

    "another possible dispersion relation for the f - excitons is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ nn0wcchimb ] . in this case ,",
    "the effective theory does not apply .",
    "such case will likely lead to the wc state .",
    "let us assume that the situation described by fig .",
    "[ nn0nt ] is realized and the effective theory is valid .",
    "clearly , the @xmath28 phase is the @xmath13 state .",
    "what is the @xmath29 state ? in , it is shown that the @xmath29 state is the laughlin state for charge @xmath31 electron pairs .",
    "the effective filling fraction for the @xmath31 pairs is @xmath33 .",
    "the @xmath28 to @xmath29 transition at @xmath34 is believed to be a continuous quantum phase transition.@xcite such a transition is a transition between the @xmath13 double layer state and the charge-@xmath31 laughlin state , which exists in the absence of interlayer tunneling .    in the presence of a finite interlayer tunneling ,",
    "the electron numbers in each layer are no longer conserved separately .",
    "the effective theory will contain extra terms to reflect this reduced symmetry .",
    "note that an f - exciton is created by the operator @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is an operator that creates @xmath9 units of @xmath25 flux .",
    "thus @xmath37 creates @xmath10 f - excitons , which correspond to an electron in one layer and a hole in the other layer .",
    "so the electron tunneling operator correspond to @xmath38 .",
    "thus , with interlayer electron tunneling , the effective theory near the transition becomes @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the amplitude of the interlayer electron tunneling .",

    "the fermionic effective theory is exactly soluble which allows us to calculate the phase diagram for the @xmath43 state ( see fig .",
    "[ 220]).@xcite for the critical point at @xmath44 , the gapless excitations are all neutral and are described by free massless dirac fermions .",
    "for the critical point at @xmath45 , the neutral gapless excitations are described by free massless majorana fermions .",
    "state , the charge-@xmath31 laughlin state , and @xmath1 state . ]    when @xmath46 , the effective theory for the @xmath13 state can not be solved .",
    "so we do not know the phase diagram , except that when @xmath47 we belive that there is a continuous phase transition at @xmath34 .",
    "it is possible that such a continuous phase transition is stable against a small interlayer tunneling .",
    "however , a large interlayer tunneling may induce a phase transition from the @xmath13 state to a new state which will be called the single - layer @xmath13 state and denoted as @xmath48 state .",
    "this leads to the proposed phase diagram for the @xmath13 state ( see fig . [ 330 ] ) .",
    "what are the properties of the @xmath48 state ? for large interlayer tunneling @xmath40 , the electron state created by @xmath49 has a lower energy and the state created by @xmath50 has a higher energy .",
    "( here @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the electron operators in the two layers . )",
    "so we expect that for large @xmath40 , the @xmath13 state changes into a single - layer state where electrons are always in the even state @xmath53 .",
    "this consideration allows us to guess the groundstate wave function of the @xmath48 state ( which is induced by large interlayer tunneling from the @xmath13 state ) .",
    "then from the guessed groundstate wave function , we can obtain the physical properties of the @xmath48 state .",
    "we first note that the wave function of the @xmath13 state can be expressed as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the state with no electron and the state @xmath56 is the @xmath13 state",
    ". an electron can be in a mixed even @xmath53 and odd state @xmath57 .",
    "after the electrons are projected into the even state @xmath53 , the @xmath13 state changes into the single - layer @xmath48 state .",
    "the wave function for the @xmath48 state is then given by @xmath58 |nn0\\>\\ ] ] for even @xmath10 , we have @xmath59 and for odd @xmath10 @xmath60 here @xmath61 is the symmetrization operator and @xmath62 the anti - symmetrization operator . note that @xmath63 is the wave function for the @xmath13 state with @xmath64 being the electron coordinates in the first layer and @xmath65 the coordinates in the second layer .",
    "so the symmetrization @xmath61 or the anti - symmetrization @xmath62 perform the projection into even states @xmath53 .",
    "once we find an expression of the ground state wave function in terms of correlation , such as , then we can use the parton construction developed in to find the bulk effective theory and the edge excitations .",
    "in other words , we can determine the topological order from the expression of the ground state wave function .    in this paper",
    ", we will concentrate only on the edge states .",
