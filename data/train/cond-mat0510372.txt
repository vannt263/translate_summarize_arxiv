    "prototypes of spin glass ( sg ) are ferromagnetic dilute alloys such as fe@xmath9au@xmath10@xcite , eu@xmath9sr@xmath10s@xcite and fe@xmath9al@xmath10@xcite .",
    "those alloys have a common phase diagram as schematically shown in fig .",
    "it is shared with the ferromagnetic ( fm ) phase at higher spin concentrations and the sg phase at lower spin concentrations , together with the paramagnetic ( pm ) phase at high temperatures .",
    "a notable point is that _ a reentrant spin glass ( rsg ) transition _ occurs at the phase boundary between the fm phase and the sg phase .",
    "that is , as the temperature is decreased from a high temperature , the magnetization that grows in the fm phase vanishes at that phase boundary .",
    "the sg phase realized at lower temperatures is characterized by ferromagnetic clusters@xcite .",
    "a similar phase diagram has also been reported for amorphous alloys @xmath11b@xmath12al@xmath13 with @xmath14 = fe or co and @xmath15 = mn or ni@xcite .",
    "it is believed that the phase diagram of fig .",
    "1 arises from the competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "for example , in fe@xmath9au@xmath10 , the spins are coupled via the long - range oscillatory ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yoshida ( rkky ) interaction . also ,",

    "nevertheless , the phase diagrams of the dilute alloys have not yet been understood theoretically .",
    "several models have been proposed for explaining the rsg transition@xcite .",
    "however , no realistic model has been revealed that reproduces it .",
    "our primary question is , then , whether the experimental phase diagrams with the rsg transition are reproducible using a simple dilute model with competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions .     a schematic phase diagram of a ferromagnetic dilute alloy .",
    ", width=132 ]    this study elucidates a dilute heisenberg model with competing short - range ferromagnetic nearest - neighbor exchange interaction @xmath1 and antiferromagnetic next - nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath2 .",
    "this model was examined nearly 30 years ago using a computer simulation technique@xcite at rather high spin concentrations and the phase boundary between the pm phase and the fm phase was obtained .",
    "however , the sg transition and the rsg transition have not yet been examined .",
    "recent explosive advances in computer power have enabled us to perform larger scale computer simulations . using them , we reexamine the spin ordering of the model for both @xmath3 and @xmath4 in a wide - spin concentration range .",
    "results indicate that the model reproduces qualitatively the experimental phase diagrams .",

    "section iv presents monte carlo simulation results",
    ". we will give both the phase boundaries between the pm phase and the fm phase and between the pm phase and the sg phase .",

    "section v is devoted to our presentation of important conclusions .",
    "we start with a dilute heisenberg model with competing nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor exchange interactions described by the hamiltonian : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the classical heisenberg spin of @xmath20 ; @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively represent the nearest - neighbor and the next - nearest - neighbor exchange interactions ; and @xmath23 and 0 when the lattice site @xmath24 is occupied respectively by a magnetic and non - magnetic atom .",

    "we denote the ground state spin configuration on the @xmath66th layer as @xmath67  @xmath68 and the ground state energy as @xmath69 .",
    "then we add a distortion inside the system in such a manner that , under a condition that @xmath70 are fixed , @xmath71 are rotated by the same angle @xmath72 around some common axis .",

    ", we must give special attention to the rotational axis for @xmath71 because the reference system has a non - vanishing magnetization @xmath80 .",
    "for the following arguments , we separate each spin @xmath81 into parallel and perpendicular components : @xmath82 where @xmath83 .",
    "we consider two twisted systems .",

    "re - emphasis is that , just below the @xmath3 phase boundary between the sg phase and the m phase @xmath222 , the rsg transition is found .",
    "this phase diagram is analogous with those observed in dilute ferromagnets fe@xmath9au@xmath10@xcite and eu@xmath9sr@xmath10s@xcite . in particular ,",

    "in particular , for @xmath224 ( fig .",

    "there are ferromagnetic clusters in places .",
    "the spin directions of those clusters tilt to different directions .",
    "that is , as noted in the previous section , the m phase is characterized by the coexistance of the ferromagnetic long - range order and the ferromagnetic clusters with transverse spin component .",

    "moreover , the model was shown to exhibit reentrant spin glass ( rsg ) behavior , the most important issue .",
    "other important issues remain unresolved , especially in the rsg transition . why does the magnetization , which grows at high temperatures , diminish at low temperatures ? why does the spin glass phase transition take place after the disappearance of the ferromagnetic phase ?",
