    "the theoretical predictions @xcite of consequences of the kondo effect for the steady state conduction through quantum dots began a decade ago . at low temperatures ,",
    "a narrow resonance in the dot density of states can form at the fermi level , leading to a large enhancement of the dot s conductance , which is strongly dependent on temperature , bias , and magnetic field .",
    "many of these effects have been recently observed by a set of beautiful experiments by several groups .",
    "@xcite these successes , supplemented by the anticipation that time dependent experiments are not far behind , have spurred a number of theoretical groups .",
    "@xcite to consider the effects expected when sinusoidal biases or gate potentials are applied .",
    "indeed recent experiments@xcite have now seen kondo sidebands . also the predictions @xcite of split kondo conductance peaks have been observed in double @xcite and multiple @xcite dots .",
    "surprisingly , the application of steps or pulses , which can provide a less ambiguous measure of time scales than ac modulation , have been considered less extensively theoretically , @xcite and not at all to our knowledge experimentally .",
    "when pulsed voltage is applied to the to the quantum dot level so that it suddenly is shifted into the kondo regime , the conductance of the dot will begin to increase .",
    "the current saturates when the system reaches its new equilibrium configuration . in a previous investigation,@xcite we considered a quantum dot biased by a small voltage and calculated the time dependent change in linear response conductance when a stepped potential was applied to a gate , thereby shifting the dot into the kondo regime .",
    "some general qualitative observations were made , which now can be made quantitative through the study of a different configuration of voltage switching .    in the present work we consider the response of a quantum dot , operating as a single - electron transistor , already subject to a finite dc bias when the dot level is shifted into the kondo regime . when a finite bias is present across the dot , kondo resonances appear at each of the leads . due to the finite bias , these resonances are broadened compared to the zero bias situation.@xcite while the equilibrium or zero bias situation is relatively well understood , @xcite much less is know about the fully time - dependent situation , with refs .   and being most relevant to the present work .",
    "the present calculation determines within the non - crossing approximation ( nca ) , the transient current after a gate pulse moves the level of the single electron transistor into the kondo regime , under a large variety of temperatures and biases .",
    "we are able to extract two different timescales from our analysis , in addition to the trivial very rapid scale of the very small time response set by the tunneling rate to the leads ( or the width of the virtual - level resonance ) .",
    "the first of these is characterized by the time to reach a quasi - metastable point where the time - dependent conductance has essentially risen to its equilibrium value , and where the kondo resonance has formed into a broad quasi - smooth structure of half - width roughly equal to the bias .",
    "the second is the timescale for the emergence and formation of the narrower individual _ split _ kondo peaks ( skp ) , at a much slower timescale .",
    "this scale is also relevant for the decay of skp conductance oscillations , which may provide an experimental access to it .",
    "we model the quantum dot by a single spin degenerate level of energy @xmath0 coupled to leads through tunnel barriers .",
    "the coulomb charging energy @xmath1 prevents the level from being doubly occupied .",

    "the notation @xmath10 with no energy specified will always refer the value at the fermi level .",
    "in addition , there is a sharp temperature sensitive resonance at the fermi level ( the kondo peak ) , characterized by the low energy scale @xcite @xmath11 ( the kondo temperature ) , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a high energy cutoff equal to half bandwidth when modeled by a symmetric flat band .",

    "in this work our studies all start from an equilibrium steady state with a bias across the dot equal to @xmath19 , but where the virtual level parameter @xmath38 is at a negative value of magnitude sufficient that the initial kondo temperature is much smaller than the physical temperature @xmath25 , and the initial conductance is so small as to be negligible . in practice",

    "this virtual level parameter is suddenly shifted to its final value , which we will simply call @xmath16 ( with no time argument ) , with the bias @xmath19 and virtual - level width parameter @xmath10 unchanged .",

    "when the dot level is in its lower position , the kondo temperature of the dot is much smaller than the system temperature and the kondo resonance is essentially absent .",

    "the @xmath48 curves shown in this section , only this kondo time scale is apparent .",

    "it is obvious by inspection of the figure that the rise time of the conductance , however that should be defined , is increasing as the temperature is lowered .",
    "this increase saturates when the temperature gets to around @xmath24 or lower .",
    "more quantitatively the inverse rise time ( rise rate ) is around @xmath24 at low temperatures , but increases with @xmath25 for higher ones .",

    "the small time region @xmath53 is always non - universal , and around 25% smaller for system two than for system one . with our present algorithms ,",
    "we can not further separate the time scales using much smaller kondo temperatures , so the results even on the kondo time scale are still slightly affected by the nonuniversal fast contribution .",
    "for this reason , the conductances for system two will be a little smaller than for system one . in fourier space",

    "the simple descriptive facts that are evident by inspection of the rise - times implied by these curves are that : ( i ) for @xmath58 there is little change ; the rising rate proportional to @xmath25 discussed in the previous subsection [ smallbias ] still prevails ; ( ii ) for @xmath59 the rising rate increases roughly linearly with @xmath19 .    on a finer scale , one may see small oscillations about the final value , especially in the curves for larger @xmath19 .",
    "these result from the fact @xcite that in the presence of @xmath19 the kondo peak in steady state is split into two peaks at @xmath20 respectively .",
    "these split kondo peak ( skp ) oscillations were clearly identified in earlier work .",
    "@xcite they have a frequency almost precisely equal to @xmath19 and a lifetime that is much longer than that implied by the @xmath19 and @xmath25 rate scales , something suggested by the prescient fact that in mean field theory the oscillations are undamped .",

    "[ figures / initialwig ]     initial oscillations at short times .",
    "the top ( long - dashed ) curve in the top panel is the short time version of the system one ( @xmath61 ) curve for bias @xmath62 .",

    "the time coordinate is rescaled as indicated , to show that the frequency of the oscillation is about equal to the magnitude of virtual resonant level s energy ( measured from the fermi level ) . the renormalized value of the latter is a bit larger than the bare value @xmath63 . the bottom panel , showing the second derivatives of the curves in the top panel , more clearly identifies the period of oscillation . ]    for system one at @xmath56 and @xmath62 .",
    "the next several curves show the initial oscillations for successively larger values of @xmath64 .",
    "the second panel more clearly establishes that the frequency of these oscillations is the difference between the fermi level and the virtual level position .",
    "the investigations described above shows that by measuring the transient currents in a quantum dot subject to a finite bias as a function of bias @xmath19 and temperature , one can probe the bias - induced and thermal broadening of the non equilibrium kondo problem .",
    "the most straightforward implementation of such a measurement would be to measure the total charge transported through the dot @xmath65 when the dot level is subject to a pulse train in which the dot level is raised to the kondo regime for a time @xmath66 . by measuring the total charge @xmath65 transported trough the dot during a single pulse as a function of pulse length @xmath66 and taking the derivative with respect to @xmath66 , @xmath67",
    ", a quantity is obtained that closely follows the transient currents in the dot .",
    "the equivalence would be exact if the the current were instantly returned to zero at the end of the pulse .",
    "since the switching goes to a non - kondo region , the turnoff rate will be @xmath68 .",
    "features that occur on that scale like the initial oscillations will be masked , but the @xmath19 and @xmath25 rates , as well as the skp oscillations will be preserved .",
    "we have verified this by explicit calculations .",
    "in fig .  [ figures / gequil ] we display the large time limit of our calculations for systems one and two . since the bias is essentially zero , these represent the steady state linear response conductance .",
    "this figure shows that our results agree with general expectations including approximate universality .    the exact asymptotic curve at large @xmath69 @xmath70 was first calculated by abrikosov @xcite for the kondo impurity problem , and has been more recently adapted and applied applied to quantum dots .",
    "@xcite it can also be derived by the so - called poor man s scaling method .",

    "( [ alpharate ] ) at higher temperatures . however , our fitting procedure is less accurate at high temperatures where @xmath90 is small , and our estimated numerical error is of the same magnitude as this deviation . for this reason ,",
    "we are not prepared to say with certainty whether this is a real effect or not .",
    "an analysis of the temporal evolution of the instantaneous spectral function of the dot level does reveal significant spectral reshaping of the kondo resonance well beyond the time where the conductance has saturated.@xcite this effect suggests the presence of a slower time scale at large temperatures .",

    "we can with much less ambiguity compare this rate with the @xmath131 rate identified in ref .  , and calculated for @xmath93 . what we find is that if we divide the skp oscillation decay rates by two , then these values at our lowest temperature ( @xmath132 ) agree within their accuracy with the @xmath131 curve .",

    "]    we are not certain why half the decay rate is what seems to correspond to @xmath131 , but presumably the issue is dephasing which occurs both at @xmath127 and @xmath133 giving roughly additive contributions .",
    "another possibility is that @xmath93 ( which is currently unavailable for us ) will be further from our lowest points at @xmath134 than we expect .",

    "the effect of the vertex correction ( see appendix [ sec : korringa ] ) is dramatic indeed , making a qualitative change , as opposed to the @xmath92 correction for the @xmath136 quantum dot case .",

    "these rates appear to lead toward a quasi - metastable point , and do not negate the emergence of slower rates at longer times , and which in the case of larger @xmath19 control the damping of skp oscillations .",
    "third , at the very beginning of switching the gate , there are small initial nonuniversal oscillations at a frequency corresponding to the dot level s separation from the fermi level ( for @xmath19 s small with respect to that separation ) .",
