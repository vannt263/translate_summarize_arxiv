    "multiple - speaker localization is an auditory scene analysis module with many applications in human - computer and human - robot interaction , video conferencing , etc . in this paper",
    "we address the multiple - speaker localization problem in the presence of noise and in reverberant environments .",
    "while we use binaural recordings of the acoustic scene , the method can be easily generalized to an arbitrary number of microphones .",
    "whenever there are more sources than microphones , which is the case in the present work , the so - called w - disjoint orthogonality ( wdo ) of the speech sources @xcite is widely employed by multiple - speaker localization methods .",
    "the principle is that in each small region of the time - frequency ( tf ) domain , the audio signal is assumed to be dominated by only one source , because of the natural sparsity of speech signals in this domain .",
    "therefore , multiple - speaker localization from binaural recordings can be decomposed in the following three - step process : ( i )  binaural tf - domain localization features are extracted from the binaural signals using the short - time fourier transform ( stft ) , or another tf decomposition ; ( ii )  these features are clustered into sources , and ( iii ) the clustered features are mapped to the source locations .    traditionally , the binaural features used for localization are the interaural level difference ( ild ) and interaural time ( or phase ) difference ( it d or ipd ) , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "complex - valued features can also be used @xcite , as well as the relative phase ratio @xcite , since they can be easily clustered . however , these features are not robust to the presence of noise and reverberations . to reduce the noise effects , unbiased relative transfer function ( rtf ) estimators",
    "were adopted , such as the ones based on noise stationarity versus the non - stationarity of the desired signal @xcite , or on the probability of speech - presence and spectral subtraction @xcite , or on complex t - distribution @xcite .",
    "the rtf estimation is generalized to multiple sources in @xcite . to robustly estimate localization features in the presence of reverberations ,",
    "the precedence effect @xcite can be exploited , relying on the principle that signal onsets are dominated by the direct path .",
    "interaural coherence @xcite , coherence test @xcite and direct - path dominance test @xcite were proposed to detect the frames dominated by one active source , from which localization features that are robust to reverberations can be estimated .",
    "however , in practice , significant reflection components often remain in the frames selected by these methods , due to an inaccurate model or to an improper decision threshold . in @xcite",
    ", the tf bins dominated by one same source are grouped together based on the use of monaural features ( such as pitch and onset / offset ) .    to localize multiple active speakers using binaural features ,",
    "many models have been developed .",
    "the simplest one , assuming free - field recording with small inter - microphone distance and low reverberations , rely on frequency - independent it d features .",
    "histogram methods @xcite and k - means clustering @xcite were then proposed to group these features and localize / separate the sources . when the inter - microphone distance is larger , the problem becomes more complex since the features derived from phase measures ( ipd and it d ) are generally ambiguous along frequency due to phase wrapping . in @xcite , the it d ambiguity along frequency",
    "is solved by jointly exploiting the ild .",
    "frequency - wise clustering can be adopted , such as hierarchical clustering @xcite and weighted sequential clustering @xcite .",
    "the frequency - wise clustering faces the so - called permutation problem , i.e. the indexing of clusters can be different from one frequency to the other . to solve this problem ,",
    "the speech spectrum correlation between frequencies is exploited in @xcite .",
    "a maximum likelihood method is proposed to formulate the source localization problem in @xcite .",
    "based on manifold regularization , a semi - supervised localization method is proposed in @xcite .",
    "a probabilistic mixture of linear regressions is used in @xcite to map a high - dimensional binaural feature vector ( concatenated across frequencies ) onto source location . in @xcite , only one source is considered . in @xcite",
    "the method is extended to multiple sources relying on the wdo assumption .",
    "in @xcite it is also extended to the direct colocalization of two sources without relying on the wdo assumption and source clustering .",
    "more often , solving the feature ambiguity and/or source permutation problems amounts to ensure the continuity of binaural cues ( in particular ipd ) across frequencies .",
    "ipd profiles as a function of frequency can be unwrapped using the direct - path propagation model of potential source locations . in @xcite , permutation alignment",
    "is processed by minimizing the cost function between the observations and the propagation model . in @xcite ,",
    "the azimuth set that has the largest likelihood given the feature observations is exhaustively searched from all the potential azimuth sets . in @xcite",
    "a gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) is used to learn the azimuth - dependent ambiguous it d space of candidate sources , and the most likely azimuth with respect to the observed itds is estimated as the source direction .",
    "probabilistic models , mostly gmms , were also proposed to both cluster and map the features onto source location @xcite . here , source localization amounts to estimate the mixture model parameters from measured features , and then detect the main mixture components . in @xcite a mixture of warped lines is fitted to the ipd observation profiles .",
    "each warped line corresponds to a source direction . in @xcite",
    "each candidate interchannel time delay is considered as a gmm component .",
    "a mixture of gmms is constructed to represent multiple sources .",
    "the azimuth of each source is given by the component that has the highest weight in the corresponding gmm .",
    "a similar approach is proposed in @xcite , but with gmm components corresponding to candidate 2d source positions thanks to the use of several pairs of microphones .",
    "recently , a probabilistic clustering method was proposed in @xcite to localize an unknown number of emitting speech sources hypothetically located on a regular grid ( as the method in @xcite ) , where each grid - point location is known with respect to several microphone pairs .",
    "the relative phase ratio ( rpr ) associated with a microphone pair is predicted from the propagation model for each grid point and for each frequency .",
    "a set of complex - valued gaussian mixtures , one mixture per frequency , is built such that the mixture components share the same fixed variance and are centered around the predicted rprs .",
    "therefore the number of components equals the number of grid points .",
    "note that unlike @xcite that use a separate gmm for each source , a single gmm is used for all sources in @xcite .",
    "since the mean parameters ( predicted rprs ) and the variance are fixed , only the component weights have to be estimated . for this aim",
    ", an em algorithm is proposed that alternates between assigning rpr observations to mixture components and estimating the weights . at convergence ,",
    "the algorithm yields a weight for each grid point and the number and location of active sources is obtained by applying a threshold .",
    "the spatial sparsity is investigated in @xcite for multi - source localization in a source signals reconstruction framework . in @xcite",
    "the multiple sources are hypothetically located on a regular grid .",
    "the mixing matrix is known , and is composed of the steering vectors to all grid points . in anechoic environment ,",
    "the steering vectors are given by the free - field sound propagation model .",
    "the signal reconstruction is formulated as an @xmath0 fit between the received signals and the source images .",
    "since only a few grid points correspond to active sources , an @xmath1 regularization is used to impose the spatial sparsity of the source signals . in @xcite ,",
    "the sparse signal reconstruction problem is extended to the reverberant environment .    in this paper",
    "a new multiple - speaker localization method is proposed , based on the likelihood model of @xcite combined with the use of direct - path relative transfer function ( dp - rtf ) as a binaural feature @xcite .",
    "more precisely , this paper has the following contributions .",
    "first , it is proposed to minimize the negative log - likelihood function by adding an entropy - based penalty , which enforces a sparse solution in terms of the free model parameters , i.e. the component weights .",
    "this corresponds to enforcing the spatial sparsity of sources , i.e. selecting a small number of active sources among the large number of potential source locations , in the spirit of @xcite but implemented in a very different manner .",
    "second , it is shown that the minimization of this penalized objective function can be carried out via a convex - concave optimization procedure @xcite which is implemented using @xcite : at each iteration , the concave penalty is approximated by its first - order taylor expansion , such that the convex - concave problem becomes convex .",
    "the latter is solved using the primal - dual interior point method @xcite . in this particular case ,",
    "where only the component weights need to be estimated , the proposed optimization framework is computationally more efficient than em procedure .",
    "thirdly , it is proposed to use dp - rtf binaural features instead of rpr features .",
    "the dp - rtf is defined as the ratio between the direct path of the acoustic transfer function of the left and right channels . unlike rpr , rtf and similar features , which are polluted by reverberations , the dp - rtf bears mainly the desired localization information .",
    "the dp - rtf is estimated based on the convolutive transfer function representation @xcite of the stft - domain binaural signals . in @xcite the dp - rtf was estimated at each frequency by solving a multi - dimensional linear equation built from the statistics of the binaural signals .",
    "estimated dp - rtfs were then fed to the single - source localization method of @xcite .",
    "it was observed that the dp - rtf features outperform features based on the usual multiplicative transfer function ( mtf ) approximation @xcite .",
    "however , in @xcite it was assumed that only one single source is active and , therefore , a unique linear equation is constructed at each frequency using all available time frames .",
    "the extension to multiple sources is far from being trivial .",
    "indeed , the time frames do not belong anymore to a single source , and one has to enforce the wdo assumption . at each frequency , the multi - dimensional linear equation used for estimating the dp - rtf is now constructed from a frame region ( a set of continuous frames ) where only one source is assumed to be active .",
    "a consistency - test algorithm is thus proposed to verify whether a frame region is associated with a single source or not .",
    "if so , a _ local _ dp - rtf estimation is obtained by solving this local equation , otherwise this frame region is discarded . applying this principle to many different regions over the entire binaural power spectrogram leads to a set of dp - rtf estimates , each one assumed to correspond to one of the sources , and thus suitable for the proposed clustering framework . in practice ,",
    "sets of continuous frames associated with a single source at a given frequency widely exist due to the speech sparsity in the stft representation .",
    "overall , the proposed method leads to an efficient multiple - source localization method in the presence of noise and reverberations .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the multiple - source localization method based on a penalized maximum - likelihood estimator is described in detail in section  [ sec : localization ] .",
    "the estimation of the dp - rtf for the case of multiple speakers ( in noisy and reverberant environment ) is presented in section  [ sec : dprtf ] .",
    "experiments with both simulated and real data are presented in section  [ sec : experiments ] .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the work .",
    "we consider non - stationary source signals @xmath2 , e.g. speech , where @xmath3 $ ] denotes the source index .",
    "the received binaural signals are @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the speech mixtures , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the microphone noise signals , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the binaural room impulse responses ( brir ) from source to microphone , and @xmath11 denotes convolution .",
    "the binaural signals are transformed into the time - frequency ( tf ) domain by applying the stft .",
    "as mentioned above , many types of binaural features can be extracted in the tf domain .",
    "let @xmath12 denote the complex - valued binaural features of interest , where @xmath13 $ ] is the frame index , and @xmath14 $ ] is the frequency index .",
    "the nature of @xmath12 , namely dp - rtf features and their estimation from binaural signals is presented in section  [ sec : dprtf ] .",
    "based on the wdo assumption , a @xmath12 feature is associated with a single source . however , in practice , some of the tf bins are dominated by noise or by the presence of several sources , and hence they should not be considered by the clustering process .",
    "let @xmath15 denote the set of frame indexes , at frequency @xmath16 , that are associated with a single source .",
    "let @xmath17 denote the set of features over all frequencies and available frames .",
    "the procedure of selecting `` reliable '' features ( i.e. generating @xmath18 ) will also be detailed in section  [ sec : dprtf ] . in this section ,",
    "we exploit @xmath18 to perform source localization .",
    "the multi - source localization problem is first cast into a probabilistic clustering problem using a complex - gaussian mixture model ( cgmm ) .      in order to group",
    "@xmath12 features into several clusters and hence to achieve multiple - source localization , we adopt the complex - gaussian mixture model ( cgmm ) formulation proposed in @xcite .",
    "each cgmm component corresponds to a candidate source position on a predefined grid .",
    "source counting and localization are based on the selection of those components having the highest priors . in @xcite",
    "several pairs of microphones are used so that two - dimensional ( 2d ) localization on a 2d regular grid can be achieved . in this paper , we focus on using a single microphone pair and thus we can only estimate the sources azimuths @xcite . the extension to several microphone pairs is straightforward .",
    "we define a set @xmath19 of @xmath20 candidate azimuths regularly placed on a circular grid . in the remainder",
    ", @xmath21 denotes a candidate azimuth .",
    "can indifferently denote a source azimuth or an index of this azimuth within the grid , arbitrarily set from 1 to @xmath20 . ]",
    "the probability of an observed binaural feature @xmath22 , given that it is emitted by a sound source located at @xmath23 , is assumed to be drawn from a complex - gaussian distribution with mean @xmath24 and variance @xmath25 : @xmath26 the mean @xmath27 is the predicted binaural feature at frequency @xmath16 as provided by a direct - path propagation model .",
    "the latter can be derived from the geometric relationship between the microphones and the source candidate position .",
    "if an acoustic dummy head is used for the binaural recordings , as will be the case in our experiments , the head - related transfer function ( hrtf ) of the dummy head is used to predict the means @xmath27 by taking the hrtf ratio between channels , for each grid point @xmath23 and for each frequency @xmath16 .",
    "we now consider the grid of all possible locations , in which case the probability of a binaural feature , given the grid locations , is drawn from a cgmm : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the prior probability that the binaural feature is drawn from the @xmath23-th component , namely the prior probability that the source is located at @xmath23 , with @xmath30 .",
    "let us denote the vector of priors with @xmath31\\tp$ ] which are also referred to as the mixture component weights .",
    "since the mixture means are determined based on the source - sensor geometry , and the variance is set to an empirical value @xmath32 common to all components and all frequencies , ) , or frequency - dependent ( @xmath33 ) , or both ( @xmath34 ) . ]",
    "the components of @xmath35 are the only free model parameters .",
    "assuming that the observations in @xmath18 are independent , the corresponding log - likelihood function ( as a function of @xmath35 ) is given by : @xmath36 multiple - source localization amounts to the maximization of the log - likelihood .",
    "importantly , the model above integrates the binaural features of all frequencies by sharing the priors over frequencies , and considers as many components as grid points .",
    "intuitively , after maximization of , active speaker locations correspond to component with large weights . in practice ,",
    "a plot of the weights as a function of azimuth indeed exhibits a quite smooth curve with a few peaks that should correspond to active speakers , see section  [ sec : experiments ] .",
    "therefore , the detection and localization of active speakers could be jointly carried out by selecting the components with the largest weights .",
    "a simple strategy would consist of selecting the peaks that are above a threshold , as done in @xcite , or of selecting the @xmath37 largest peaks if the number of active sources @xmath37 is known in advance . however , spurious peaks often appear , due to , e.g. , reverberated phantom sources , corrupting the source detection and localization . in the next subsection",
    "we propose a penalized maximum likelihood estimator , to enforce a sparse solution for @xmath35 and remove such spurious peaks .",
    "let @xmath38 denote the cardinality of @xmath18 , namely the number of binaural observations .",
    "we note that can be written as : @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes a vector in @xmath41 with all entries set to 1 , @xmath42 is the matrix of probabilities reorganized so that each row @xmath43 of @xmath44 corresponds to an observation in @xmath18 and each column corresponds to a candidate source position , and where we used the notation : @xmath45\\tp.\\ ] ] then , the maximization of the log - likelihood can be written as the following convex optimization problem : @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes a vector in @xmath48 with all entries set to zero , and @xmath49 denotes entry - wise vector inequality .",
    "this convex optimization problem with equality and inequality constraints can be solved by the primal - dual interior - point method ( pdipm ) @xcite , which will be described in section  [ pdip ] .",
    "we remind that the parameter @xmath50 is the prior probability of having an active source at location @xmath23 . in practice ,",
    "the number of active speakers is much lower than the number of candidate locations on the grid .",
    "one may consider a grid with tens or hundreds of source locations , but only a handful of this locations correspond to actual sources .",
    "therefore , we may seek a sparse vector @xmath35 i.e. with only a few nonzero entries . to enforce the sparsity of @xmath35 we propose to add a penalty term to the objective function in ( [ eq : cov ] ) .",
    "the entries of @xmath35 are probability masses of a discrete random variable .",
    "generally , the sparser the vector , the smaller entropy @xmath51 is .",
    "thence , the entropy may be used as the required penalty . a sparse solution for @xmath35",
    "can be obtained by solving the following optimization problem : @xmath52 where @xmath53 plays the role of a normalization factor , and @xmath54 is an empirical parameter that enables to control the trade - off between the log - likelihood and the entropy .",
    "the entropy @xmath55 is a concave function .",
    "thence the problem can be solved via a convex - concave procedure ( ccp ) @xcite .",
    "to solve the ccp , an iterative method is proposed in @xcite . at each iteration ,",
    "the concave function is approximated by its first - order taylor expansion , so that the convex - concave function becomes a convex function .",
    "the derivative of the entropy w.r.t .",
    "@xmath35 is @xmath56 and the first - order taylor expansion at @xmath57 is @xmath58 the solution of ( [ eq : ccp ] ) is summarized in algorithm [ alg : ccp ] which is referred to as ep - mle ( entropy - penalized maximum likelihood estimator ) . a convergence proof of this procedure is provided in @xcite .",
    "subproblem  ( [ eq : subcov ] ) is a convex optimization problem with equality and inequality constraints and , again , it is solved with pdipm .",
    "the algorithm is stopped when the decrease of the objective function ( [ eq : ccp ] ) from one iteration to the next is lower than a threshold @xmath59 .",
    "ccp can have ( many ) local minima , thence the initialization is important for searching the global minimum , just as for em algorithms . if @xmath54 is small , we assume that the global minimum is in the close proximity of the minimum of ( [ eq : cov ] ) .",
    "therefore , the initialization of algorithm  [ alg : ccp ] is set as the solution of ( [ eq : cov ] ) , obtained with pdipm .",

    "@xcite provides a general optimization algorithm for a convex objective function @xmath65 with a set of inequality constraints of the form @xmath66 and an affine equality constraint . here",
    "@xmath67 is the objective function in ( [ eq : cov ] ) or ( [ eq : subcov ] ) , and @xmath68 .",
    "the optimization can be expressed as solving the karush - kuhn - tucker ( kkt ) conditions : @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are auxiliary variables that originate in the use of the lagrange multiplier associated with the inequality and equality constraints , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath72 sets the accuracy of the logarithmic barrier approximation , the larger @xmath72 , the better the approximation .",
    "the nonlinear kkt conditions can be solved by algorithm  [ alg : pdipm ] , with the update rule in step  4 given by : @xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes the iteration index , @xmath75 is the identity matrix , and @xmath76 is the step - length . in the present study ,",

    "in this section we propose to estimate the direct - path relative transfer function ( dp - rtf ) for multiple speakers , which is an extension of the single - speaker case @xcite .",
    "the rationale of using the dp - rtf is twofold .",
    "first , it is robust to noise and reverberations and , second , it is a well - suited binaural feature to be used within the complex - valued generative model . for clarity ,",
    "we first shortly present the single - speaker case @xcite , and then we move to the multiple - speaker case .      in the case of a single speaker ,",
    "the noise - free received binaural signals are @xmath114 in the stft domain , the mtf approximation is only valid when the impulse responses @xmath115 and @xmath116 are short , relative to the stft window . to represent a linear filter with long impulse response in the stft domain more accurately , the cross - band filters were introduced @xcite , and a ctf approximation is further introduced and used in @xcite to simplify the analysis .",
    "let @xmath117 and @xmath118 denote the size and the shift of the stft window , respectively .",
    "following the ctf , @xmath5 is approximated in the stft domain by : @xmath119 where @xmath120 and @xmath121 are the stft of @xmath5 and @xmath122 , respectively .",
    "the number of ctf coefficients @xmath123 is related to the reverberation time .",
    "the first ctf coefficient @xmath124 can be interpreted as the @xmath16-th coefficient of the fourier transform of the impulse response segment @xmath125 .",
    "this holds whatever the actual size of @xmath115 , including if this size is much larger than the stft window length @xmath117 . without loss of generality , we assume that the room impulse response @xmath115 begins with the impulse response of the direct - path propagation .",
    "if the frame length @xmath117 is properly chosen , @xmath125 is thus composed of the direct - path impulse response and possibly of a few reflections .",
    "hence we refer to @xmath124 as the direct - path acoustic transfer function ( atf ) .",
    "a similar statement holds for @xmath116 and its corresponding direct - path atf @xmath126 . by definition ,",
    "the dp - rtf is given by @xmath127 .",
    "we remind that the direct - path propagation model in general , and the dp - rtf in particular , have proven to be relevant for sound - source localization .",
    "based on the ctf model of two channels , in the noise - free case we have : @xmath128 . dividing both sides by @xmath124 and reorganizing the terms in vector form we can write : @xmath129 where @xmath130\\tp \\nonumber \\\\ \\mathbf{g}_k & = \\left[\\frac{b_{0,k}}{a_{0,k}},\\dots,\\frac{b_{q-1,k}}{a_{0,k}},-\\frac{a_{1,k}}{a_{0,k}},\\dots,-\\frac{a_{q-1,k}}{a_{0,k}}\\right]\\tp . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we see that the dp - rtf appears as the first entry of the reverberation model @xmath131 . by multiplying both sides of ( [ eq : zpk ] ) with @xmath132 ( the complex conjugate of @xmath133 ) and by taking the expectation ( in practice averaging the corresponding power spectra over consecutive @xmath134 frames ) , we obtain : @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the power spectral density ( psd ) estimate of @xmath6 at tf bin @xmath137 , and @xmath138 is a vector composed of cross - psd terms between the elements of @xmath139 and @xmath140 . as for the noisy case",
    ", an inter - frame spectral subtraction algorithm can be used for noise suppression , e.g. @xcite : the auto- and cross - psd of a frame with low speech power are subtracted from the auto- and cross - psd of a frame with high speech power . due to the stationarity of noise and the non - stationarity of speech , the resulting power spectra estimates ,",
    "@xmath141 and @xmath142 , have low noise power and high speech power .",
    "let @xmath143 be the set of frame indices with high - speech power ( at frequency @xmath16 ) .",
    "after the spectral subtraction , we have : @xmath144 with @xmath145 denoting the residual noise of the spectral subtraction procedure . using the frames indexed in @xmath143 ,",
    "a set of linear equations can be built and solved , yielding an estimate @xmath146 of @xmath131 and its first component is the estimated dp - rtf .",
    "as just summarized , all the frames in @xmath143 can be used to construct a dp - rtf estimate in the case of a single speaker .",
    "this is no more valid in the case of multiple speakers , since the frames in @xmath143 do not necessarily correspond to the same source .",
    "hence the dp - rtf estimation method must be reformulated in the case of multiple emitting sources . by applying the stft to ( [ eq : signal ] ) ,",
    "the recorded binaural signals write : @xmath147 without any additional assumption , ( [ eq : gpk ] ) does not generalize to multiple sources , and thus we can not directly estimate the dp - rtf associated to each source using the statistics of the mixture signals @xmath5 and @xmath6 measured on any arbitrary set of frames . to exploit the above results , we resort to the wdo assumption ,",
    "i.e. we assume that in a small region of the tf plane only one source is active .",
    "based on this assumption , the dp - rtf in a given tf bin is assumed to correspond to at most one active source . in the following ,",

    "the results for the proposed ep - mle and the basic - cgmm method are quite similar , hence the entropy penalty has no significant influence in these conditions .",
    "it can be seen that ep - mle , basic - cgmm , and rtf - ct - cgmm ( hence all cgmm - based methods ) have narrower peaks than messl .",
    "the reason is that , after spectral subtraction , the proposed dp - rtf features and the rtf features are less noisy than the ild / ipd used in messl . for drr  =  @xmath228  db ( right column )",

    "even the srp - phat profile , though made very hectic by the intense reverberations , keeps its maximum at @xmath253 .",
    "however , the source at @xmath255 does not have a very large peak for rtf - ct - cgmm , whereas there is a much higher peak at @xmath256 .",
    "one possible reason for this is that a high amount of reverberations decreases the number of tf bins dominated by the direct - path propagation of a single source , hence a lower number of tf bins can be selected by the coherence test .",
    "in addition , an improper threshold can make the detected tf bins involve reflections .",
    "messl fails to detect the source at @xmath255 as well : there are still two prominent peaks but the second one is clearly misslocated at @xmath257 .",
    "the reason for this is that the ild / ipd features are heavily contaminated by strong reverberations .",
    "finally , the very hectic profile of srp - phat does not allow the detection of the second source .",
    "in contrast , it can be seen that the proposed ep - mle and basic - cgmm methods provide second - prominent peaks at the correct source location ( actually at @xmath258 for ep - mle ) .",
    "this again shows that , compared with the mtf - based rtf feature , the proposed dp - rtf feature is more reliable for multi - source localization in highly reverberant environments .",
    "in addition to the peaks at the correct azimuths , there are also a few other spurious peaks in the case of the basic - cgmm method .",
    "the use of the entropy penalty in ep - mle successfully suppresses the spurious peaks and strengthen the true peaks .",
    "this illustrates well the sparsity - enforcing property of the entropy penalty term .",
    "for the semi - blind configuration , correct localization is obtained by both ep - mle and basic - cgmm , in this example .",
    "but in the blind configuration , the selection threshold is very difficult to set automatically for the basic - cgmm method , due to amplitude similarity of the correct peak at @xmath255 and of the spurious peak at @xmath259 .",
    "this may easily lead to either miss detection or false alarm .",
    "in contrast , the ep - mle method enables a large range of threshold values that lead to correct detection in this example .",
    "note that there is a larger risk of errors for basic - cgmm even in the semi - blind configuration : a slightly larger spurious peak at @xmath259 would lead to a wrong localization .

    "it can be seen that , for all three methods , the average of the md rate and fa rate is generally larger than the outlier rate in the semi - blind configuration , which verifies that the blind configuration is more difficult than the semi - blind one .",
    "also , for all methods and in a very general manner , both md and fa increase when either the snr or the drr decreases , and when the number of speaker goes from two to three , which was expected . for the proposed ep - mle method in particular , a larger dp - rtf estimation error is caused by more intense reverberations , which lead to more spurious peaks and peak shifts .",
    "for a given drr , md increases with the decrease of the snr or with the increase of the number of speakers , since , as mentioned above , the method may suffer from a lack of sufficient number of dp - rtf observations . when the acoustic conditions get worse in terms of snr or drr , mae increases due to the larger dp - rtf estimation error .    in general , md , fa and mae",
    "are considerably smaller for the proposed ep - mle method ( and for basic - cgmm ) compared to the rtf - ct - cgmm method , which is consistent with the results obtained for the semi - blind configuration . unlike the semi - blind configuration , it can be seen that md and fa are both smaller for ep - mle than for basic - cgmm , while the mae are comparable , for almost all acoustic conditions ( all except for md at snr  @xmath260  db , drr  @xmath261  db , 2 speakers ) .",
    "this confirms the importance of the penalty term in the blind configuration .",
    "the semi - blind configuration inherently limits the fa score , and at the same time it can `` force '' the detection of low peaks , ensuring correct md scores .",
    "in contrast , the setting of the threshold in the blind configuration favours either the md or the fa .",
    "therefore , in the blind configuration , it is more crucial to reduce the spurious peaks and enhance the correct peaks to facilitate the thresholding operation , which is exactly what is done by the entropy penalty term . by reducing the entropy to a proper extent ,",
    "usually , the cgmm component weights corresponding to interfering directions are significantly decreased , while the weights of the true source directions are enhanced .",
    "thence , md and fa are both decreased by the entropy penalty term .",
    "table  [ tab : resultsnao ] shows the blind localization results obtained with the proposed method , with basic - cgmm , and with rtf - ct - cgmm , and the semi - blind localization results obtained by srp - phat . note",
    "that , messl was not tested in this experiment , since it is not directly usable with two microphone pairs . in general , the performance measures reported in table  [ tab : resultsnao ] are consistent with the results obtained on the simulated data .",
    "compared to basic - cgmm , ep - mle has smaller md under all conditions , smaller fa under two conditions out of four ( and for the other two conditions , the fa values for both methods are very close ) , and a comparable mae .",
    "this illustrates the effectiveness of the entropy - based penalty for multiple source localization from real - world signals .",
    "also , the proposed method significantly outperforms the rtf - ct - cgmm method , since , again , the quantity and the quality of the observations are both higher for the proposed dp - rtf features than the rtf features based on the coherence test .",
    "srp - phat has a high outlier rate due to the spatially correlated noise and real world reverberations .",
    "in this paper , we presented a method for multiple - source localization in reverberant and noisy environments .",
    "the method is based on the model of @xcite with the following original contributions : ( i ) the use of an entropy - based penalty term which enforces sparsity for the estimation of the model parameters , implemented via a convex - concave optimization procedure that is more efficient than an em algorithm , ( ii ) the use of dp - rtf features , providing localization that is robust to both noise ( thanks to the inter - frame power spectral subtraction ) and reverberations , and ( iii ) the proposed consistency test algorithm that ensures that dp - rtf features are estimated from frame regions associated to a single active speaker , thus making possible to use these features for multiple - speaker localization .",
    "overall , experiments conducted on both simulated and real - world data show that ( i ) the proposed dp - rtf features are more reliable than classical mtf - based features , for instance rtf features , ( ii ) the proposed cgmm model with dp - rtf features provides a better source localization compared to three baseline methods ( rtf - based , messl , srp - phat ) in a semi - blind configuration , and ( ii ) the entropy penalty term used in the proposed localization technique makes it able to better localize the sources compared to the basic version of the same method ( i.e. without the entropy penalty term ) ; this is especially true in a blind configuration where the proposed method is efficient in _ jointly counting and localizing the sources_. the experiments showed that the entropy - based penalty significantly improves the localization performance in terms of missed detections and false alarms .    in this study ,",
    "the entropy - based penalty weighting coefficient @xmath54 was set to an empirical fixed value leading to good overall performance for all tested conditions . in future work , a principled setting of @xmath54 could be investigated , considering the noise level of the dp - rtf observations .",
    "also , the dp - rtf features are more robust than mtf - based features at the cost of the need for more reliable data . an improved dp - rtf estimation process requiring less data",

    "<S> this paper addresses the problem of multiple - speaker localization in noisy and reverberant environments , using binaural recordings of an acoustic scene . </S>",
    "<S> a gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) is adopted , whose components correspond to all the possible candidate source locations defined on a grid . after optimizing the gmm - based objective function , </S>",
    "<S> given an observed set of binaural features , both the number of sources and their locations are estimated by selecting the gmm components with the largest priors . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved by enforcing a sparse solution , thus favoring a small number of speakers with respect to the large number of initial candidate source locations . </S>",
    "<S> an entropy - based penalty term is added to the likelihood , thus imposing sparsity over the set of gmm priors . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the direct - path relative transfer function ( dp - rtf ) is used to build robust binaural features . </S>",
    "<S> the dp - rtf , recently proposed for single - source localization , was shown to be robust to reverberations , since it encodes inter - channel information corresponding to the direct - path of sound propagation . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we extend the dp - rtf estimation to the case of multiple sources . in the short - time fourier </S>",
    "<S> transform domain , a consistency test is proposed to check whether a set of consecutive frames is associated to the same source or not . </S>",
    "<S> reliable dp - rtf features are selected from the frames that pass the consistency test to be used for source localization . </S>",
    "<S> experiments carried out using both simulation data and real data gathered with a robotic head confirm the efficiency of the proposed multi - source localization method . </S>"
