    "it is now widely acknowledged that magnetic reconnection , which entails the conversion of magnetic energy into plasma particle energy , drives many astrophysical phenomena in the universe .",
    "some well - known examples include magnetospheric substorms , gamma ray bursts , stellar and solar flares @xcite . under normal circumstances ,",
    "this fast conversion would not be possible for highly elongated current sheets , as the conventional estimates for the reconnection rate are too low .",
    "fortunately , it has been known since the 1980s that such current sheets are subject to a violent instability that was dubbed the plasmoid instability , as it results in the formation of plasmoids @xcite .",
    "the plasmoid instability breaks up the elongated current sheets , and leads to very high reconnection rates that are nearly independent of the lundquist number @xmath7 in the nonlinear regime @xcite .",
    "the emergence of this fast reconnection process , mediated by the plasmoid instability , has been shown to have several important consequences .",
    "plasmoid reconnection plays an important role in regulating solar flares @xcite , coronal mass ejections @xcite , chromospheric jets @xcite , particle acceleration @xcite , pulsar winds @xcite , blazar emissions and jets @xcite , as well as laboratory and fusion experiments @xcite .    in plasmoid - mediated reconnection",
    ", a great deal of analytic and numerical work has been undertaken for the linear regime . in sweet - parker current sheets , scaling relations for the growth rate and number of plasmoids produced were predicted by @xcite and @xcite as a function of @xmath7 , and were generalized to encompass arbitrary magnetic prandtl numbers in @xcite .",
    "however , in dynamically evolving current sheets , the final sweet - parker aspect ratio can not be achieved , as they disrupt prior to this stage @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite utilized a principle of least time to formulate a general theory for the onset and development of the linear phase of the plasmoid instability .",
    "they demonstrated that the scalings were no longer true power laws , and depend on other parameters , namely the characteristic timescale of current sheet evolution , and the initial perturbation amplitude .    from the observational standpoint , it is not very feasible to verify the linear stage of the plasmoid instability .",
    "as a result , a great deal of interest has been centred on the nonlinear phase of this instability .",
    "one of the most notable amongst them is the distribution of plasmoids as a function of their intrinsic properties , such as their flux and width . from the theoretical standpoint ,",
    "there have been three major works in this subject , albeit only for plasmoids emergent from a 2d reconnection process . @xcite and",
    "@xcite proposed phenomenological kinetic models for the flux distribution function , and arrived at scaling laws with exponents of @xmath1 and @xmath8 respectively . on the other hand , @xcite prescribed rules for the generation , growth and merging of plasmoids , and arrived at an integro - differential equation for the distribution function that depended on the flux and the area .",
    "there are , arguably , two important factors that need to be taken into account when paving the way for a more complete theory .",
    "firstly , the distribution function is obviously statistical , as a result of which it would clearly be ideal to rely on a more statistical - mechanical approach based on first principles .",
    "secondly , many of the theoretical and numerical studies in the area have relied on heuristic models with simplified geometries to arrive at their results .",
    "hence , except in certain circumstances , the resultant parameters and the distribution function may not constitute true observables .",
    "it is , therefore , the goal of this work to construct a 3d plasmoid distribution function that depends on three genuinely physical observables , viz .",
    "the mass , total flux and the velocity . during the course of the paper",
    ", we shall use the nomenclature `` plasmoids '' to describe magnetic islands in three dimensions , i.e. flux ropes / tubes @xcite . in 3d geometry , the magnetic field lines could become stochastic , and the flux surfaces may not be well - defined @xcite . yet , one can still identify coherent structures which can be treated on the same footing as flux ropes .",
    "hence , in this paper , we shall operate with the implicit assumption that well - defined coherent structures ( or flux ropes ) are existent .",
    "our paper is centered around the principle of maximum entropy @xcite , which has been successfully used in many fields of science .",
    "we shall derive the full distribution function , examine the various asymptotic limits , and eventually cover its connections with astrophysics .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . a short introduction to the principle of maximum entropy",
    "is offered in sec .",

    "[ secandf ] , the single - variable distribution functions for the mass , width , total flux , helicity and velocity are obtained .",

    "[ secconc ] .",
    "in this section , we shall briefly elucidate some of the salient features of the principle of maximum entropy ( maxent ) , which has been used quite extensively in many areas of astronomy and astrophysics @xcite .",
    "we also discuss its relevance in the context of determining the distribution of plasmoids .      in equilibrium statistical mechanics",
    ", it is known that the micro- , macro- and grand canonical distribution functions can be derived through a common principle .",
    "the central idea relies upon the maximization of the entropy @xmath9 with respect to the probabilities @xmath10 , subject to holding the appropriate constraints on the system fixed @xcite . by drawing upon the classical ideas of boltzmann , gibbs and shannon , e.t .",
    "jaynes explored the connections between information theory and statistical mechanics and argued that statistical mechanics could be interpreted as a method for inferring the probability distributions based on the ( limited ) data available @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to consider jaynes own words @xcite in this regard : _ `` in the resulting `` subjective statistical mechanics , '' the usual rules are thus justified independently of any physical argument , and in particular independently of experimental verification ; whether or not the results agree with experiment , they still represent the best estimates that could have been made on the basis of the information available . '' _",
    "maxent has enjoyed a considerable degree of success ranging from fields as disparate as ecology @xcite and climate science @xcite on the one hand to gravitational dynamics @xcite and plasma physics @xcite on the other hand . in some of these works , a minimum entropy principle ( minent ) was utilized as opposed to the standard maxent .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite for a discussion of the subtle connections between these two , outwardly conflicting , theories .",
    "we shall not go into further details of maxent as there exist several excellent reviews and summaries of the subject @xcite , and detailed analyses of the arguments for and against maxent can also be found therein .      in dealing with the plasmoid distribution function ,",
    "it is clear that the system can not necessarily be regarded as being in equilibrium throughout , that the plasmoids themselves are complex entities ( unlike , for e.g. , ideal gas molecules ) , etc .",
    "fortunately , as per the discussion in sec .",
    "[ ssecmeint ] , many of these points are rendered moot .",
    "firstly , we recall that maxent must be understood as a general statement regarding statistical inference , and its generalization , maximum caliber ( maxcal ) , is valid when dealing with non - equilibrium systems @xcite . since maxent is applicable to complex systems close to equilibrium @xcite , it could potentially be used for deriving the plasmoid distribution function .    a comment regarding",
    "the choice of the entropy functional is in order . at times",
    ", there is a tendency to associate the boltzmann - gibbs - shannon ( bgs ) entropy only with the presence of an associated kinetic equation .",
    "in actuality , the bgs entropy has been `` postulated '' in a more general and axiomatic manner @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the bgs entropy is endowed with the necessary mathematical and physical requirements , such as invariance , concavity , and additivity to name a few @xcite .",
    "hence , bearing these properties in mind , we are now free to adopt the standard approach of @xcite and construct a variational principle wherein the bgs entropy functional can be extremized whilst holding the necessary constraints fixed .",
    "here , we shall delineate some general properties of the plasmoid distribution function @xmath11 , motivate the appropriate constraints , set up the variational principle , and thereby arrive at the plasmoid distribution function .",
    "let us begin by considering the variables that the plasmoid distribution function @xmath12 depends upon .",
    "we begin by noting that our `` system '' is now taken to comprise of the collection of plasmoids alone , and not the entire current sheet as a whole .",
    "there are many properties that can characterize a particular plasmoid .",
    "these include :    * the mass @xmath13 enclosed within a given plasmoid . * the density @xmath14 of a particular plasmoid .",
    "notice that a knowledge of @xmath13 and @xmath14 suffices to determine the volume @xmath15 of the plasmoid .",
    "* the total flux @xmath16 enclosed in the plasmoid .",
    "the use of the word `` total '' is deliberate , as we are dealing with the 3d setup .",
    "it also constitutes an observationally relevant physical variable , particularly in the solar context @xcite . *",
    "the velocity @xmath17 associated with the motion of the plasmoid .",
    "* the position @xmath18 describing the spatial location of the plasmoid .",
    "in addition to the above quantities , the plasmoid distribution function can be expected to evolve over time as well .",
    "@xmath12 could also depend on other properties , but we believe that we have listed all of the most salient candidates . clearly , retaining all of these variables would make our procedure very onerous and rob it of physical transparency .",
    "hence , we shall introduce the following simplifications :    * we are ultimately interested , by means of maxent , to determine the final @xmath12 that the system relaxes to . in this case , an explicit dependence on time is not expected to be present .",
    "* we shall assume that the plasma inside the plasmoids is incompressible , i.e. we shall take @xmath19 , and hence it does not enter our model . *",
    "handling a spatial dependence is more difficult , and we shall consider the cases where @xmath12 does not depend on @xmath18 , which may be valid when the system is spatially homogeneous . as the coarse - grained distribution function where the @xmath18 dependence has already been eliminated . ]    thus , based on the above set of postulates , the distribution function has the form @xmath20 . as with the previous theories , the distribution function @xmath12 and its constituent variables are continuous .",
    "although we know that @xmath21 , we still do not know how the volume depends on the half - width @xmath22 and on the area . to resolve this matter",
    ", we must introduce an additional simplification .",
    "in 3d , it is natural to speak of flux ropes or flux tubes @xcite , and our choice of the word `` plasmoids '' should actually be taken to refer to such entities .",
    "these structures can be envisioned as cylinders with radius @xmath22 and height @xmath23 , and we shall introduce the assumption @xmath24 .",
    "this does not significantly reduce the generality of our analysis , since one can easily make @xmath25 a function of @xmath22 .",
    "the current simplification amounts to the statement that all plasmoids have a self - similar structure , i.e. their volumes and areas may be different , but they have the same value of height to radius .",
    "such ansatzen have already been used quite often in other areas of physics , where the basic `` building blocks '' are extended objects , such as liquid crystals and polymers @xcite .",
    "we finally end up with @xmath26      before exploring the constraints that need to be included in the variational principle , a brief discussion of the dynamics is necessary .",
    "there are three basic processes involved :    * new plasmoids are `` born '' , and they `` grow '' by accreting mass and flux , growing bigger in size . * two plasmoids can `` collide '' and thereby `` merge '' . some of the merging rules have already been explored in @xcite and @xcite . * plasmoids can be effectively said to have `` died '' when they have been ejected out of the current sheet .",
    "let us now take a look at some of the potential constraints that are feasible .",
    "+ * total number : * although processes i and iii create and destroy plasmoids , there is no guarantee that they balance each other . in addition ,",
    "process ii does not conserve the number of plasmoids , since the total reduces by unity .",
    "therefore , taken collectively , there is no reason to believe that the total number @xmath27 is conserved .",
    "even if this constraint were incorporated , the overall effect would be trivial since the distribution function would just end up being multiplied by a constant factor . + * total mass : * it is clear that the mass must be conserved during process ii .",
    "however , there are two other processes , one of which depletes the mass and the other that replenishes it . if we assume that , even though each of the processes are dynamical , the whole system can exist in a state of detailed balance , enabling the total mass to be conserved .",
    "thus , the total mass is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the volume of the total phase space . +",
    "* total momentum : * it is tempting to argue that a similar set of arguments should hold true for momentum conservation . in the 2d case ,",
    "at least , one does _ not _ expect the total momentum ( along each direction ) to be conserved , owing to the fact that there exist clear inflow and outflow directions .",
    "some processes can occur only along the former , and others along the latter alone .",
    "thus , there is a fundamental asymmetry with respect to the axes for all the three processes , implying that momentum conservation along all the directions ought not be possible . + * total flux : * when we consider flux , it is known that flux is _ not _ conserved during the merging of two plasmoids , viz . in process ii @xcite . to compensate for this absence of conservation , processes i and ii would need to self - adjust in a very precise manner for flux conservation to hold true .",
    "if this were indeed valid , the total flux @xmath30 would be conserved . in ( [ flux ] ) , the distinction between the total flux @xmath31 of the complete system and the total flux @xmath16 of a given plasmoid must be duly borne in mind .",
    "+ * total energy : * one of the most fundamental laws in the universe is the conservation of energy , closely linked with time - translation symmetry @xcite . taken individually , none of the processes can conserve the energy , but together , there is a possibility for doing so .",
    "if energy conservation is indeed valid for our system , then @xmath32\\,dm\\,d\\psi\\,d{\\bf v},\\ ] ] and the first term is clearly the kinetic energy , whilst the second term is the magnetic energy that is discussed further below . we have neglected thermal energy in our analysis , as this introduces a further level of complexity by means of an extra variable .",
    "moreover , many plasmas are characterized by @xmath33 @xcite , which is consistent with the neglect of the thermal energy .",
    "furthermore , for arbitrary @xmath34 with an adiabatic equation - of - state , we have verified that the overall scalings remain unaltered . in the preceding discussion ,",
    "note that the mhd energy was utilized .    in the energy",
    ", @xmath35 is a dimensionless constant that depends upon @xmath25 and other numerical factors ( such as @xmath36 ) .",
    "we are not interested in the exact expression for @xmath35 as we seek instead to evaluate the _ algebraic _ dependence of @xmath12 .",
    "we have also assumed that our system has a vanishingly small ( or exactly zero ) guide field .",
    "our procedure can also be generalized to include a finite guide field , but we shall not pursue this line of enquiry here .    it is easy to verify that the second term represents the magnetic energy by carrying out a simple dimensional analysis .",
    "a second method for arriving at this expression is via the magnetic helicity .",
    "suppose that the magnetic energy and helicity of a plasmoid are represented by @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively . from dimensional considerations ,",
    "it is once again evident that @xmath39 where the second equality follows by observing that @xmath40 , the characteristic length scale , must correspond to either @xmath22 or @xmath23 .",
    "either of these two quantities can be determined in terms of @xmath13 via ( [ mrrel ] ) .",
    "thus , if we show that @xmath41 , we will recover the magnetic energy in ( [ energy ] ) .",
    "this is explored below , when the total helicity is introduced as the next constraint .    the first equality in ( [ magehelrel ] )",
    "can also be justified on more rigorous grounds than dimensional analysis .",
    "we have already stated that our plasmoids are now modelled as flux tubes .",
    "for some special configurations , wherein the sum of the twist and the writhe is zero , it is known that @xmath42 where @xmath43 @xcite , and the @xmath13-dependence can be determined via ( [ mrrel ] ) .",
    "the above inequality , which also goes by the name of the ` realizability condition ' , was first proven by arnold in the 1970s @xcite .    the above approach relied upon topological fluid mechanics , and",
    "the reader may consult @xcite for a recent overview of this subject for a diverse array of plasma fluid models .",
    "there is also a more direct means of arriving at @xmath37 in ( [ energy ] ) via this area of research .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the minimum value of the magnetic energy attained through a relaxation process is @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is an invariant that solely depends on the magnetic topology and can be computed exactly in certain scenarios @xcite .",
    "clearly , upon using ( [ mrrel ] ) , this expression has the same form as the magnetic energy delineated in ( [ energy ] ) . +",
    "* total helicity : * most of the interest in the total magnetic helicity stems from its unique topological properties @xcite .",
    "there is considerable experimental and theoretical evidence that supports the robustness of helicity conservation even in the presence of magnetic reconnection @xcite .",
    "hence , it is quite plausible that the total magnetic helicity of the system is also conserved .",
    "then , we end up with @xmath46 and the factor of @xmath47 could be justified , as earlier , through dimensional analysis .",
    "it can also be obtained on mathematical grounds - it was shown by @xcite that the helicity , modulo topological invariants ( such as the gauss and calugareanu - white linking numbers ) , was quadratic in the flux ; we also refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "the relation @xmath41 is also backed by a fairly high degree of empirical evidence from solar observational data @xcite . in reality ,",
    "( [ helicity ] ) would also involve an extra numerical factor , which can be easily eliminated by simply rescaling the definition of @xmath48 .",
    "the bgs entropy functional for our model corresponds to @xmath49 with @xmath12 denoting the plasmoid distribution function .",
    "we are now in a position to write down our variational principle as all the relevant pieces have been assembled .",
    "let us commence our analysis with an important observation .",
    "of all the constraints discussed in sec .",
    "[ sseccons ] , only the energy exhibits a complex dependence on _ all _ three variables , namely @xmath13 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "in contrast , all of the other functionals are dependent on just one variable .    to summarize , the mass ( [ mass ] ) , flux ( [ flux ] ) , energy ( [ energy ] ) and helicity ( [ helicity ] ) have been chosen as our constraints .",
    "thus , our variational principle is given by @xmath50 we have chosen the notation @xmath51 and @xmath34 for the target functional and the lagrange multiplier preceding the energy .",
    "our choices are deliberate since these quantities can be rightfully seen as the generalizations of the helmholtz free energy and the inverse temperature ( from thermodynamics ) respectively @xcite .    upon variation ,",
    "we arrive at @xmath52 and if we take @xmath53 , the similarity with the canonical ensemble distribution function @xcite is not very surprising , given that only the energy constraint has been included . here , note that @xmath54 is the total plasmoid energy .",
    "we are now in a position to start analyzing the properties of the plasmoid distribution function ( [ eqdf ] ) . we shall present the derivation of the distribution functions for the mass , width , total flux , helicity and ( 3d ) velocity in this section .",
    "we commence our derivation by introducing @xmath55 which represents the joint distribution function of the plasmoids as a function of @xmath16 and @xmath13 .",
    "an inspection of ( [ eqdf ] ) reveals that it is dependent _ only _ on the modulus of @xmath17 .",
    "hence , we are free to use the transformation @xmath56 . in sec .",
    "[ sseccons ] , we stated that we shall consider a system where the guide field is absent , implying that one can not define motion parallel and perpendicular to the guide field .",
    "hence , it seems reasonable to suppose that the conventional ranges for @xmath57 and @xmath58 , namely @xmath59 $ ] and @xmath60 $ ] respectively , are valid .",
    "this leads us to @xmath61 , and substituting it into ( [ mpsidf ] ) results in @xmath62,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the limits of integration are from @xmath63 to @xmath64 .",
    "next , one can analytically calculate the mass distribution as follows @xmath65 and the integration limits are taken to be positive as per the standard convention .",

    ", we have used the fiducial values @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the latter value was chosen because this factor appears in the magnetic energy . ]",
    "we are now in a position to extract the two limits of the mass distribution .",
    "we find that @xmath70 but it is necessary to recognize that the immediate higher - order contribution is @xmath71 , which is smaller than the leading - order contribution ( [ m0df ] ) only by a factor of @xmath72 which exhibits a weak dependence on @xmath13 .",
    "hence , the @xmath0 exponent will not prevail for long , as it will be subsumed by the higher - order contributions at a fairly early stage . in the other limit",
    ", we have @xmath73 and the exponential cutoff is clearly dominant in this region , subsuming the power - law behavior .",
    "we have plotted ( [ mdf ] ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : distribution_m ] - the power - law limit for small @xmath13 , namely ( [ m0df ] ) , has also been included .",
    "it is clear that , for larger values of @xmath13 , the exponential falloff becomes more important .",
    "the overall structure of fig . [ fig : distribution_m ] is quite similar to the 2d numerical results of @xcite ( see their fig .",
    "10 ) , although our ( 3d ) power - law slope is slightly steeper .    under a change of variables , the probability contained in a differential area",
    "is known to be constant @xcite .",
    "let us denote the width distribution of the plasmoids by @xmath74 . using this principle , we find @xmath75 and we can now make use of ( [ mrrel ] ) . after simplification ,",
    "we arrive at @xmath76 where @xmath77 implies that the function @xmath78 is evaluated at @xmath79 . for the sake of completeness",
    ", we shall present the two limits for the width distribution below .",
    "we begin with @xmath80 and it is important to reiterate that our analysis is for the",
    "_ 3d case_. a similar result was also proposed in the 2d case by @xcite via their phenomenological arguments and numerical results .",
    "we also refer the reader to the 2d simulations by @xcite and @xcite where the same scaling law was obtained .",
    "the slopes ( for the width distribution ) can be evaluated in the 3d case when compared to the 2d case given the _",
    "same _ mass distribution . of course",
    ", one expects the 2d and 3d cases to have different mass distributions as well , but it is still instructive to consider the above argument . let us assume that @xmath81 in the limit @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is positive .",
    "then , in the 2d case , we find that @xmath84 since @xmath85 in the 2d case .",
    "for the 3d case , we use @xmath86 that leads us to @xmath87 from ( [ r2ddf ] ) and ( [ r3ddf ] ) , we see that the 3d width distribution is steeper than its 2d counterpart only when @xmath88 is valid .",
    "it is clear from ( [ m0df ] ) that this condition is indeed met since @xmath89 , leading to a steeper 2d distribution .",
    "a consequence of our analysis is that the width distribution of @xmath1 would not be possible in 2d , if the mass distribution were still the same as ( [ m0df ] ) .",
    "the other limit for the width distribution is found from ( [ minfdf ] ) , and is of the form @xmath90 we have plotted ( [ rdffin ] ) in fig . [",

    "hence , we shall not present it here , but we have duly carried out the series expansion for @xmath92 .",
    "the leading order contribution is @xmath93 indicating that the slope of the distribution function is steeper than the 2d analyses conducted by @xcite and @xcite , who arrived at slopes of @xmath1 and @xmath8 respectively .",
    "but , we wish to point out two notable differences : ( i ) our work assumes a 3d geometry , and ( ii ) the flux @xmath16 that we have used is the total flux and is therefore not the same variable as the one that they had used .",

    "since the 1970s and 1980s , detailed observations of flux ropes / tubes ( that we have referred to as `` plasmoids '' ) in the earth s magnetotail have been available @xcite .",
    "it was also during this period that a great deal of progress , both from a theoretical and observational standpoint , was achieved concerning the formation and properties of plasmoids @xcite . by the 1980s",
    ", it was well understood that plasmoids were inherently three - dimensional in nature , corresponding to flux rope / tube structures @xcite .",
    "in contrast , many theoretical and numerical studies to this day tend to be two - dimensional in their scope .",
    "there have been many statistical analyses of 3d plasmoids ( flux ropes ) over the past few decades in the terrestrial , solar and planetary contexts @xcite . from these studies ,",

    "16 ) and @xcite ( see fig .",
    "13 ) also appear to show a somewhat similar trend . * in fig .",
    "9 of @xcite , the velocity distribution declines for larger @xmath145 , thereby proving to be qualitatively similar to the trend predicted in sec .",
    "[ ssecveldf ] .",
    "furthermore , in the martian magnetosphere , the width distribution may also display an exponential falloff for large values , as predicted by ( [ rdfinfty ] ) - see fig .",
    "4b of @xcite .",
    "but , we wish to emphasize that the above statements must be viewed with due caution , mostly because of the fact that the number of plasmoids in these statistical estimates was typically quite low .",
    "there exist many commonalities between the flux rope structures observed in the magnetotail and in coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) , as noted in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "several statistical analyses of flux rope properties ( such as the width ) have been conducted in recent times . in @xcite ,",
    "small flux ropes @xcite were shown to obey a power - law width distribution with an exponent of @xmath155 ( other cases such as @xmath156 and @xmath157 were also considered ) , whilst magnetic clouds ( larger frs ) obeyed a gaussian distribution .",
    "these results are mostly consistent with our theoretical predictions ( [ r0df ] ) and ( [ rdfinfty ] ) , especially the former where the power - law exponent of @xmath1 was derived .",
    "we also refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite for the size distributions , which were also analyzed by @xcite in their work .",
    "a summary of the current status of these statistical studies can be found in section 4.3 ( see also fig .",
    "17 ) of @xcite .",
    "the combination of a power law at small scales , and the exponential cutoff at larger scales was also obtained in @xcite through the use of topological methods .",
    "clearly , this result is qualitatively consistent with our methodology which predicts the same behavior , i.e. the absence of a universal power law across all scales .",
    "although the authors suggest that the power - law exponent for small values may be approximately @xmath8 , this prediction is partially motivated by the relation @xmath158 that was proposed in @xcite .",
    "moreover , our result does not appear to directly contradict their findings since the limit ( [ r0df ] ) is formally valid only in the limit @xmath159 .",
    "the prediction in this regime can not be easily probed by either the simulations or the data ( on account of an insufficient number of plasmoids ) .",
    "hitherto , we have focused on comparing the general trends ( and specific results ) predicted by our model with some of the existent observations .",
    "we close this section by pointing out a couple of avenues where our scalings may prove to be useful in understanding astrophysical systems .",
    "the first is the capacity of plasmoid motions and plasmoid - mediated reconnection for driving particle acceleration , which has been studied extensively ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the velocity distribution of the plasmoids computed herein may enable a better understanding of how particle acceleration can occur via interactions with plasmoids .",
    "lastly , we observe that plasmoid reconnection has been studied extensively in the context of solar phenomena such as flares and cmes @xcite .",
    "most of these processes are likely to be operational on other stars as well .",
    "a better understanding of the statistical properties of the ejected plasmoids could contribute to our understanding of the distribution of superflares and cmes on m - dwarfs @xcite . in turn",
    ", we expect that gaining such knowledge would enable us to make some progress towards understanding the prebiotic chemistry @xcite and atmosphere escape rates of exoplanets , especially around m - dwarfs @xcite .",
    "in statistical physics , the principle of maximum entropy has proven to be very successful in deducing the probability distribution function given a set of constraints .",
    "the advantage of the approach stems from its simplicity , physical transparency and versatility - the latter stems from the interpretation of this method as a form of statistical inference that can be applied to near - equilibrium systems @xcite .    after adopting this approach , we arrived at the final distribution function for the plasmoids in 3d , which depended on the mass , velocity and total flux , each of which are physically meaningful variables . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "a 3d analysis along these lines is completely novel , and the distributions for these variables have never been derived before .",
    "our final expression for the three - variable distribution function , viz .",
    "( [ eqdf ] ) , depended on four free parameters , as well as another one that quantified the geometric shape of the plasmoids . at first glimpse , one may therefore argue that there is a high degree of arbitrariness , owing to the large number of unspecified parameters .",
    "but , we showed that a high degree of universality still emerged when the mass , width , total flux , and helicity distribution functions were determined .",
    "they all possessed a power - law behavior for small values , and were subject to an exponential falloff for large values .",
    "moreover , the power - law exponents at small values were very robust , and were nearly independent of the choices of free parameters .",
    "the power - law exponents were @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 for the mass , width , flux , and helicity distributions respectively . even for larger values ,",
    "the exponential functions were shown to have some degree of commonality , regardless of the parameter choices .",
    "the emergence of this general behavior was even more striking when the distribution function for the ( 3d ) velocity was considered .",
    "we showed that the small and large limits of the velocity distribution _ both _ led to power laws , with exponents of @xmath160 and @xmath5 , when computed as a function of the variable @xmath3 .",
    "the two exponents remained mostly unaffected by the choices of the free parameters prevalent in our overall distribution function , which lends credence to the hypothesis that these asymptotes may be quite universal .",
    "lastly , we have undertaken a preliminary comparison of our model with the observational data , and concluded that the former yields results that are mostly consistent with the latter .",
    "it must , however , be recalled that this study was somewhat rudimentary , and in - depth observational ( and numerical ) data analyses , along the lines of @xcite , are undoubtedly necessary for obtaining a clear picture of the strengths and weaknesses of the theoretical model .",
    "along the way , we also delved briefly into the attendant astrophysical implications for phenomena ranging from particle acceleration to solar flares and cmes .",
    "as the formalism proposed in this paper possesses a high degree of generality , several avenues open up for subsequent research .",
    "the same analysis can be redone by introducing a new set of constraints for the 2d system that are clearly distinct from the 3d case @xcite , and the ensuing scaling laws are also expected to be different compared to their 3d versions .",
    "another possibility is to obtain the distribution of relativistic plasmoids , which could then be compared against the simulations undertaken by @xcite",
    ". the inclusion of turbulent kinetic and magnetic energies might also pave the way for analyzing the statistical properties of turbulent plasmoid - mediated reconnection @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "based on the simplicity and elegance of the maxent approach , we suggest that further theoretical analyses along these lines may be warranted .",
