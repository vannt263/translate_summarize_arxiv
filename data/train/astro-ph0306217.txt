    "understanding of statistical properties of _ dark matter halos _ has been significantly advanced in recent years , largely owing to the development of high - resolution numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "given those theoretical / empirical successes , a next natural question is how to apply them for the description of _ real _ galaxy clusters .",
    "while there exist a number of attempts along this line , they usually make the unrealistic assumption of the halo spherical symmetry @xcite .",
    "this paper describes a methodology to reconstruct the three - dimensional ( 3d ) structure of dark halos from the two - dimensional ( 2d ) surface brightness profiles of intra - cluster gas from the x - ray and/or sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect observations assuming that the halos are triaxial ellipsoids with a constant axis ratio .",
    "indeed it is a classical problem in astrophysics to determine the 3d properties of astronomical objects from the observed 2d counterparts .",
    "deprojecting galaxy clusters is one of the most important applications .",
    "@xcite analyzed the x - ray surface brightness map of clusters , and showed that their mass distribution is far from being spherical .",
    "@xcite developed a general method of deprojecting the 2d images of rich clusters based on the fourier slice theorem to reconstruct the 3d cluster structures .",
    "later their technique was tested against numerically simulated galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed a deprojection method for spherical clusters based on the abel integral .",
    "@xcite provided a parameter - free richardson - lucy algorithm to reconstruct the 3d halo potential , and demonstrated its stability by applying it to gas - dynamical simulations .",
    "@xcite provided a perturbative approach to the cluster deprojection , taking into account the non - isothermality and asphericity of galaxy clusters .",
    "recently , @xcite also considered the problem of deprojecting aspherical clusters .",
    "they first constructed a parameterized 3d axisymmetric cluster model , and determined the 3d cluster shapes through the @xmath0-fitting between the model predictions and the simulated cluster data .",
    "all the previous approaches , however , were based on rather restrictive assumptions such as the cluster axial symmetry ( e.g. , oblate or prolate ) about the line - of - sight , and/or the isothermality of galaxy clusters . furthermore in their approaches",
    ", it was required to combine x - ray and/or sz effect data with weak lensing ( wl ) map , which significantly limits the applicability of the previous methods .",
    "in fact , it is generally believed that it would be a difficult task to deproject the clusters from the 2d projected x - ray or sz observables alone without having such restrictive assumptions and priors given the degeneracy of the parameters due to the the projection process itself .",
    "lee & suto ( 2003 ; hereafter paper i ) suggested that one may understand the properties of the dark matter halos from the intra - cluster gas profiles . assuming that the intra - cluster gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium in the triaxial dark matter halos , paper i derived the 3d density and temperature profiles of the intra - cluster gas from the 1st principles using the perturbation theory , and found an analytic relation between the eccentricities of the intra - cluster gas and the underlying dark halo ( see eq.[28 ] in the paper i ) .",
    "however , the perturbation result of the paper i is valid only in the asymptotic limit of the low asphericity , and did not include the effect of the projection of the gas profiles on the plane of the sky . here",
    ", we generalize the works of the paper i to the case of highly aspherical clusters , and attempt to find a general relation between the dark halos and the intra - cluster gas taking into account the parameter - degeneracy caused by the projection . for the practical purpose of our theoretical modeling , we provide a series of empirical fitting formulae for the 2d and 3d gas profiles which can be used as templates in comparing with the observed profiles of clusters , and demonstrate the degree of the feasibility of the halo reconstruction using the template formulae and the simulated surface brightness maps of x - ray and sz effect .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we construct a theoretical model for the intra - cluster gas in hydrostatic equilibrium within the gravitational potential of a triaxial dark matter halo with a constant axis ratio , and provide a series of empirical fitting formulae for the 3d gas profiles in a systematic manner . in ",
    "3 we consider the projection of the 3d gas profiles onto the plane of the sky , and provide another series of empirical fitting formulae for the 2d surface brightness density profiles . in ",
    "4 we describe a numerical algorithm to determine the 3d structures of the dark halos from the observed 2d cluster surface brightness profiles , and test the algorithm against a numerical toy model .",
    "finally we discuss the final results , and draw our conclusions in  5 .",
    "to predict theoretically the x - ray and sz profiles of galaxy clusters , one first needs a good physical model for the intra - cluster gas . here",
    "we assume that the intra - cluster gas is either isothermal or polytropic , and in hydrostatic equilibrium within the gravitational potential generated by a concentric and coaxial triaxial dark matter halo .",
    "consider a triaxial dark halo whose iso - density surfaces are given by the following equation : @xmath1 where the cartesian system of coordinates @xmath2 is aligned with the halo principal axes , oriented such that the @xmath3-axis and @xmath4-axis run along the major and minor principal axes , respectively .",
    "the major axis length of the iso - density surface is denoted by @xmath5 , while @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) represent the two constant eccentricities of the ellipsoidal dark halos .",
    "equation ( [ eq : isodensity ] ) implies that the density profile of a triaxial dark matter halo should be a function of the major axis length @xmath5 .",
    "we adopt the density profile of a triaxial dark halo proposed by @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the scale length , @xmath11 is the dimensionless characteristic density contrast with respect to the critical density @xmath12 of the universe at the present epoch , and @xmath13 represents the inner slope of the density profile .",
    "@xcite showed that @xmath14 on the cluster scale and @xmath15 on the galaxy scale . for simplicity and definiteness , we focus on the case of @xmath16 throughout this paper .    the gravitational potential due to the ellipsoidal halos described by equation ( [ eqn : den ] ) is formally expressed as @xcite : @xmath17 } { \\sqrt{(\\tau + 1)(\\tau + 1 - e^2_{b})(\\tau + 1 - e^{2}_{c})}}d\\tau , \\\\",

    "note that the right - hand - side of equation ( [ eqn : ecc ] ) are written in terms of the rescaled spherical radius @xmath51 instead of the rescaled major axis length , which results from the fact that we neglected the higher - order terms @xmath52 in deriving equation ( [ eqn : ecc ] ) with the perturbation theory .",
    "although equation ( [ eqn : ecc ] ) seems complicated , it is a slowly varying function , and well approximated as a constant in the range of @xmath53 ( see fig .",
    "3 of paper i ) such that @xmath54 strictly speaking , equation ( [ eqn : newecc ] ) is valid only in the limit of @xmath45 over the range of @xmath53 . to proceed further in a tractable fashion ,",

    ", we assume that the iso - density surfaces of the intra - cluster gas are triaxial ellipsoids with the constant eccentricities of @xmath56 that are related to the halo eccentricities @xmath57 by equation ( [ eqn : newecc ] ) . actually this turns out to be a good approximation as will be shown below .",
    "this assumption allows us to write the potential function @xmath33 in terms of the major axis length of the gas iso - density surfaces , @xmath58 , defined as @xmath59 after some trials and errors , we find that the following empirical formula fits both equations ( [ eq : fphi_isothermal ] ) and ( [ eq : fphi_polytropic ] ) quite well : @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 are free parameters .",
    "the four free parameters are not constant but supposed to be functions of the halo eccentricities .",

    "compute @xmath33 numerically using equations ( [ eqn : phi ] ) and ( [ eqn : psi ] ) for various values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "2 .   fit those numerical data points to the empirical model ( eq . [ [ eqn:3dmodel ] ] ) and obtain the best - fit values of @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 using the levenberg - marquardt method @xcite .",
    "3 .   finally model those best - fit parameters as functions of @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in practice , we find that all the parameters can be written as functions of a single variable @xmath65 .",
    "we find the following polynomials to provide good fits : @xmath66 table [ table:3d_coef ] lists the best - fit values of the polynomial coefficients .",
    "the best - fit values of the constant @xmath62 is determined to be unity for all cases .",
    "figure [ fig:3dparameter ] plots @xmath61 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 as a function of @xmath67 .",
    "the filled circles indicate the best - fit values of the parameters , while the solid lines represent their polynomial fits .",
    "note that @xmath64 is one order - of - magnitude smaller than @xmath61 for all cases , suggesting that the term associated with @xmath64 can be safely neglected except at the outer part of clusters .",
    "the accuracy of the fits is illustrated in figure [ fig:3dprofile ] where @xmath68 is plotted against @xmath58 .",
    "the solid lines represent the numerical results while the dashed lines correspond to equation ( [ eqn:3dmodel ] ) with the best - fit coefficients of the polynomials plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:3dparameter ] and listed in table [ table:3d_coef ] .",
    "our empirical fitting formulae reproduce the numerical results very well for all cases over a wide range of @xmath58 within a fractional error less than @xmath69 .",
    "the characteristic feature of our fitting model is that all the parameters are expressed in terms of @xmath70 . given that the first - order perturbation approach of the paper i indicated the dependence of the halo potential on @xmath71 , one may have expected the fitting model to depend on @xmath71 rather than @xmath72 . as a matter of fact , we indeed attempted first to model the parameters in terms of @xmath71 .",
    "but , it turned out that the parameter values do not scale in terms of @xmath71 while they show very good scaling feature in terms of @xmath72 as shown in figure [ fig:3dparameter ] .",
    "we have not yet completely understood the origin of this scaling , but the result is empirically quite robust .",
    "in addition , we note that in the paper i we derived the gas - halo eccentricity relation ( eq .",
    "[ [ eqn : ecc ] ] ) by using the first - order perturbation theory , and showed that the approximation error can be expressed as a function of @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( see eqs [ 29 ] and [ 30 ] in the paper i ) .",
    "the dependence of the approximation error on @xmath73 and @xmath74 implies that the higher order terms neglected in the first - order perturbation result may be scaled in terms of @xmath73 and @xmath74 . now that we have used equation ( [ eqn : ecc ] ) to construct the fitting model ( eq . [ [ eqn:3dmodel ] ] ) , one may expect that equation ( [ eqn:3dmodel ] ) has similar scaling . in other words , we suspect that the dependence of equation ( [ eqn:3dmodel ] ) on @xmath72 rather than @xmath71 may be related to the scaling of the higher order terms neglected in the first - order perturbation result of the paper i.    note also that in our model the gas density / temperature profiles do not approach zero even at large @xmath51 .",
    "this feature is ascribed to the hydrostatic equilibrium condition itself . in reality",
    ", the hydrostatic equilibrium condition may be satisfied only within some radius , e.g. , the virial radius of the cluster .",
    "in fact , the halo density profiles at those regions are not well approximated by equation ( [ eqn : den ] ) because of the presence of substructures , and so on .",
    "this problem , however , is unlikely to limit the validity of our methodology in practice since the x - ray and sz fluxes from regions beyond the cluster virial radius are usually negligible .",
    "now we are in a position to model the x - ray and sz surface brightness profiles of triaxial galaxy clusters by incorporating the projection effect into the 3d models developed in @xmath75 . just for comparison ,",
    "let us recall that the surface brightness profiles of spherical clusters can be readily evaluated as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the angular radius from the center of the cluster , @xmath78 is the angular diameter distance to the cluster , and @xmath79 is the emissivity given in terms of @xmath80 and @xmath81 such that @xmath82 for bolometric x - ray and @xmath83 for sz observations , respectively . for the case of a triaxial cluster ,",
    "however , the result becomes much more complicated because the 2d projection depends on the relative direction of the line - of - sight of an observer with respect to the principal axes of a triaxial halo .",
    "the projection effect of triaxial bodies on the plane of the sky is fully discussed by @xcite and @xcite . in what follows",
    "we adopt the notation of @xcite .",
    "let @xmath84 be the polar angle of the line - of - sight in the halo principal coordinate system @xmath2 , and let the observer s coordinate system be defined by cartesian axes @xmath85 with @xmath86-axis aligned with the line - of - sight direction and @xmath87-axis lying in the @xmath88 plane ( see fig . 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "then the halo principal coordinate system @xmath2 is related to the observer s coordinate system @xmath85 by @xmath89 if we use the major axis length @xmath58 defined in equation ( [ eqn : isogas ] ) to characterize the iso - density surfaces , then the projection of @xmath79 onto the plane of the sky is written as @xmath90 where @xmath91 hence @xmath92 . in other words ,",
    "the 2d isophotal curves of triaxial galaxy clusters are concentric and coaxial ellipses if their eccentricities @xmath48 of the _ gas _ iso - density surfaces are constants . as we noted before , however , it is not exactly the case for our model where the eccentricities @xmath46 of the _ halo _ iso - density surfaces are constant",
    ". nevertheless this holds approximately ( see eq.[[eqn : newecc ] ] ) .",
    "let us define a dimensionless surface brightness @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "in the same spirit as for the 3d model ( [ eqn:3dmodel ] ) , we propose the following empirical model for the 2d surface brightness profiles : @xmath96 note that @xmath97 depends not only on @xmath67 but also on @xmath27 ( or @xmath40 ) , and even on the polytropic index @xmath36 for the polytropic case .",
    "thus , we consider the isothermal and polytropic cases separately , and obtain the following empirical fits .    for the isothermal gas ,",
    "the parameters are fitted to the following polynomials of @xmath67 and @xmath27 : @xmath98 for the polytropic gas , we fix @xmath36 to @xmath99 following @xcite , and fit the parameters to the following polynomials of @xmath67 and @xmath27 : @xmath100 we determine the best - fit values of @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 using the same method as in @xmath75 .",
    "first we calculate @xmath97 of equation ( [ eqn : proj ] ) numerically , approximating the integration @xmath104 to @xmath105 where @xmath106 which is roughly twice the virial radius of galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "then we compare the numerical data points of @xmath97 with the fitting formula ( [ eqn:2dmodel ] ) , and determine the best - fit values for each point using the levenberg - marquardt method .",
    "finally we model the free parameters as polynomials of @xmath67 and @xmath27 ( or @xmath40 ) , and determine the best - fit polynomial coefficients .",
    "the best - fit constant values of @xmath107 is determined to be unity for both the isothermal and polytropic cases just like the 3d model .",
    "figures [ fig:2disopara ] and [ fig:2dpolypara ] plot the best - fit parameters as functions of @xmath67 for three different values of @xmath27 ( or @xmath108 ) .",
    "it is clear from these figures that the polynomial fitting works quite well for all cases .",
    "tables [ table : iso_coef ] and [ table : poly_coef ] list the best - fit coefficients @xmath109 for the cases of bolometric x - ray and sz observations , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig:2dprofile ] illustrates the degree of the accuracy of our fitting formulae .",
    "the filled squares represent the numerical results while the solid lines represent our fitting models with the best - fit polynomials of @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 .",
    "we have found that our fits reproduce the numerical results within the fractional error of @xmath113 for all cases in a range of @xmath114 .",
    "in the triaxial dark halo model that we adopt here , the halo reconstruction from the x - ray and sz cluster observations is basically to determine the shapes ( @xmath57 ) and the orientations ( @xmath115 ) of the dark halos from the observed surface brightness profiles .    in  3",
    ", we construct a parameterized model for the x - ray and sz surface brightness profiles of galaxy clusters .",
    "the model is expressed as a function of the rescaled major axis length of the gas isophotes and characterized by three parameters .",
    "it turns out that the rescaled major axis length and the three parameters depend on the eccentricities and the orientation angles of the underlying dark halos , as well as the gas constant .",
    "therefore , we find a way to link the observed 2d surface brightness profiles of galaxy clusters to the 3d structures of the underlying dark halo and the gas constants of the intra - cluster gas as well .",
    "in other words , one may expect to determine the values of @xmath116 and @xmath117 by fitting our 2d parameterized models ( eqs .",
    "[ [ eqn:2dmodel ] ]  [ [ eq:2dparam_poly ] ] ) to the x - ray and sz cluster data .    to demonstrate how our modeling of cluster profiles can be used in the determination of the shapes and the orientations of dark matter halos , we apply the following reconstruction algorithm to the numerically projected profiles .",
    "we first numerically compute @xmath97 directly using equations ( [ eqn : phi])-([eqn : proj ] ) .",
    "then we construct a pixeled map of surface brightness in @xmath118 grids ( @xmath119 in the present example ) corresponding to the linear scale of @xmath120 since @xmath121 is roughly equal to the cluster virial radius @xcite .",
    "we create several realizations of x - ray and sz profiles for both isothermal and polytropic cases using various different values of @xmath122 .",
    "our reconstruction algorithm proceeds as follows ;    * at each pixel point , say , @xmath123 , build the model @xmath124 using equation ( [ eqn:2dmodel ] ) .",

    "those systematic / random errors should depend on specific observation conditions and thus are not easy to estimate a priori .",

    "the numerical testing results have revealed that the above algorithm works quite well in reconstructing the halo eccentricities within the fractional error of @xmath132 as long as the halo eccentricities are not so small ( @xmath133 ) , which can be understood considering that our reconstruction algorithm strongly relies on the non - spherical signature , and thus is expected to fail for the case of almost spherical halos with low eccentricities ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "for the low eccentricity cases , the perturbation results of the paper i may be more useful . since the low - eccentricity case is not the main interest of the present paper , we do not investigate those cases here .",

    "for most cases , the fractional errors fall within @xmath132 .",
    "however , for a few cases , the fractional errors are larger than @xmath154 , indicating that the angle reconstruction is not always stable compared with the eccentricity reconstruction .",
    "it was regarded as a difficult task to reconstruct the 3d structures of dark matter halos from the projected 2d surface - brightness maps of x - ray and/or sz clusters given the parameter - degeneracy caused by the projection process itself . to break the degeneracy , previous approaches had to rely on such restrictive assumptions as the cluster axial symmetry about the line - of - sight and some priors like weak lensing informations .",
    "here we have developed , for the first time , a theoretical framework within which the 3d halo reconstruction is possible in principle without such restrictive assumptions and additional priors .",
    "we derived the density profiles of the intra - cluster gas from the 1st principles , assuming that the intra - cluster gas is either isothermal or polytropic , and in hydrostatic equilibrium within the gravitational potential of concentric and coaxial triaxial dark matter halos . in our theoretical modeling of the intra - cluster gas ,",
    "the density profiles depend explicitly on the intrinsic properties of the underlying halos ( the two halo eccentricities , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) . for the case of highly aspherical halos , however , we have found that the gas density profiles can not be expressed in closed analytic forms .",
    "therefore , we have attempted to find general fitting formulae for the gas density profiles as functions of the halo eccentricities which may be applicable even to highly aspherical clusters .",
    "we have found empirically a simple scaling relation with respect to @xmath155 , and provided a set of fitting formulae for the 3d gas density profiles expressed in terms of @xmath67 .",
    "then , we have incorporated the projection effect into the gas density profiles , and provided another set of fitting formulae for 2d x - ray and/or sz surface brightness density profiles of galaxy clusters . unlike the 3d formulae , the 2d formulae are expressed in terms of not only @xmath67 but also the orientation angles of the line - of - sight in the halo principal axes . in other words , we have found a link of the 2d x - ray and/or sz observables to the shapes and the orientations of the dark matter halos .    we have proposed a numerical algorithm based on our model to determine the halo eccentricities and orientation angles from the observed x - ray and sz surface brightness density profiles of galaxy clusters .",
    "ideally we have to apply our algorithm to real observation data , but that is beyond the scope of the present paper since it should involve careful treatment of the data image analysis together with various observational systematic effects .",
    "thus we have decided to test the reconstruction algorithm against simple numerical profiles .",
    "we found that the algorithm can reconstruct the halo eccentricities fairly accurately if the halo eccentricities are greater than @xmath156 . on the other hand",
    ", it turns out that the reconstruction of the halo orientation angles are not always accurate , showing large scatters .",
    "finally , we conclude that our hydrostatic - equilibrium model for intra - cluster gas in triaxial dark halos makes it possible in principle to reconstruct the 3d structures of the dark halos from the x - ray and/or sz cluster maps , as long as the intra - cluster gas and the dark halos are well approximated to be in hydrostatic equilibrium and the triaxial ellipsoids with a constant axis ratio , respectively .",

    "<S> while the use of galaxy clusters as _ tools _ to probe cosmology is established , their conventional description still relies on the spherical and/or isothermal models that were proposed more than 20 years ago . </S>",
    "<S> we present , instead , a deprojection method to extract their intrinsic properties from x - ray and sunyaev  zeldovich effect observations in order to improve our understanding of cluster physics . </S>",
    "<S> first we develop a theoretical model for the intra - cluster gas in hydrostatic equilibrium in a triaxial dark matter halo with a constant axis ratio . in this theoretical model , </S>",
    "<S> the gas density profiles are expressed in terms of the intrinsic properties of the dark matter halos . </S>",
    "<S> then , we incorporate the projection effect into the gas profiles , and show that the gas surface brightness profiles are expressed in terms of the eccentricities and the orientation angles of the dark halos . for the practical purpose of our theoretical model , we provide several empirical fitting formulae for the gas density and temperature profiles , and also for the surface brightness profiles relevant to x - ray and sunyaev  </S>",
    "<S> zeldovich effect observations . finally , we construct a numerical algorithm to determine the halo eccentricities and orientation angles using our model , and demonstrate that it is possible in principle to reconstruct the 3d structures of the dark halos from the x - ray and/or sunyaev - zeldovich effect cluster data alone without requiring priors such as weak lensing informations and without relying on such restrictive assumptions as the halo axial symmetry about the line - of - sight . </S>"
