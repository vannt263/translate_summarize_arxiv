    "the idea of quantum defect in atomic physics has been introduced many years ago for rydberg atoms , to describe their similarity and difference with the hydrogen atom : the presence of the ionic core in the rydberg atom induces a phase shift , i.e. a defect , on the wave function of the rydberg electron which occasionally travels through the core , compared to the pure coulombic wave function which is called the _ reference _ wave function .",
    "it is well known that the usual rydberg law for hydrogen level energies @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the rydberg constant and @xmath2 the principal quantum number , is then modified according to @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the quantum defect associated to a rydberg series ( referred to as a _ channel _ ) characterized by the orbital angular momentum @xmath5 of the outer electron .",
    "the rydberg law can be easily extended to rydberg electronic states of a diatomic molecule , by defining a quantum defect @xmath6 which now depends on the projection @xmath7 of @xmath5 on the molecular axis , on the internuclear distance @xmath8 , and on the internal quantum state @xmath9 of the molecular ionic core . in a rydberg system ,",
    "the wave function of the rydberg electron inside the region defined by a range @xmath10 of strong interaction with the ionic core is independent , apart from a normalization factor , from the generally weak binding energy @xmath11 of the electron .",
    "the remaining nodal structure of the wave function outside this region is only determined by the coulomb tail of the electron - core potential .",
    "the quantum defect is basically independent of @xmath11 , so that it can be extrapolated through the energy threshold to describe electronic continuum states , i.e. ionization . in most systems ,",
    "several rydberg series are present in the same energy range , which most likely interact together .",
    "such situations are described with the multichannel quantum defect theory ( mqdt)@xcite , which involves quantum defects for each of the @xmath12 channels and coupling parameters between them , constituting the so - called @xmath13-matrix with dimension @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the quantum defect concept is very appealing in the context of ultracold gases , as it expresses the same idea than the scattering length for elastic collisions between ultracold atoms .",
    "such a collision induces a phase shift on the wave function of the relative motion of the atoms , created by their strong interaction when they lie together within a distance @xmath15 .",
    "the scattering length is an effective parameter directly related to this phase shift , and characterizes the short - range interaction between the atoms . just like in the previous case , the wave function inside @xmath15",
    "does not depend - apart from a normalization factor - on the relative ( weak ) energy of the atoms , while beyond @xmath15 , it is controlled by the long - range interaction of the atoms , expressed as a multipolar expansion @xmath16 of the potential energy .",
    "several authors worked at designing a generalized multichannel quantum defect theory ( gmqdt ) to treat interaction potentials with non - coulombic asymptotic behavior @xcite , in order to represent the vibrational spectrum of small molecules close to their dissociation limit , or the collisions between atoms for energies just above the dissociation threshold .",
    "in contrast with the pure coulomb field problem ( defining electronic rydberg series ) , there are an infinite number of possibilities for the choice of the reference functions for the molecular problem ( involving vibrational series ) .",
    "therefore the central issue is to find reference functions adapted to an arbitrary long - range variation of interaction potentials , in order to rigourously define quantum defects and relevant channel couplings @xcite .",
    "recently , gmqdt has been used to study feshbach resonances in ultracold atomic binary collision @xcite .",
    "these studies have shown that gmqdt accurately recovers close - coupling ( cc ) cross sections results @xcite , and brings more physical insight on the underlying molecular processes .    using the same approach than in ref.@xcite , we focus our attention on the characterization of the position and the width of resonances in the photoassociation of ultracold atoms , which strongly depends on the choice of reference functions .",
    "we demonstrate that the optimization of the reference functions @xcite based on a procedure introduced in ref.@xcite , leads to quantum defects with a weak energy dependence across the relevant energy threshold , just like in the standard mqdt situation .",
    "we compare our results to numerical coupled - channel calculations performed in the framework of the fourier grid hamiltonian method @xcite combined with an optical potential approach for the resonance characterization @xcite .",
    "the main result of our paper is that the agreement between the both theoretical approaches is achieved only if optimized reference functions are used in the mqdt framework .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first present in section [ sec : rb2 ] the chosen physical situation , i.e. the photoassociation of ultracold rubidium atoms into mixed electronic molecular states coupled by spin - orbit interaction .",
    "we recall next the main features of its numerical description using the mapped fourier grid hamiltonian ( mfgh ) method with an optical potential ( section [ sec : mfgh ] ) , yielding vibrational energies and predissociation line widths for high - lying vibrational levels of the coupled electronic states . in section [ sec : gmqdt ] , we present a summary of the gmqdt treatment required to calculate the position and width of resonances .",
    "we compare in section [ sec : results ] the results obtained by the two theoretical approaches for both the discrete and the resonant spectrum .",
    "finally we discuss the validity of the gmqdt parameters defined in previous analysis of this system , in order to shed light on their predictive power for future experiments .",
    "atomic units will be used for distances ( @xmath17=0.052917720859  nm ) and energies ( @xmath18  @xmath19 ) , except otherwise stated .",
    "the coupling mediated by spin - orbit interaction of the @xmath21 and @xmath22 electronic states ( hereafter referred to as the @xmath23 and @xmath24 states , or as the ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) coupled system ) correlated to the lowest excited @xmath25 dissociation limit in alkali dimers , represents a well - known case for the breakdown of the born - oppenheimer approximation which strongly perturbs their spectroscopy .",
    "this is particularly true in heavy alkali dimers like rb@xmath26 @xcite , which required novel methods to deperturb the spectra recorded in high - resolution molecular spectroscopic studies @xcite , where almost all rovibrational levels exhibit a mixed singlet / triplet character up to the dissociation limits .",
    "this pattern has also been observed in heteronuclear systems involving one heavy alkali atom like narb @xcite , nacs @xcite , and rbcs @xcite . in the context of the photoassociation ( pa ) of ultracold rubidium atoms ,",
    "this strong interaction results into perturbations and predissociation resonances which have been observed for the first time in ref.@xcite .",
    "such perturbations have been further studied experimentally in the pa spectra of rb@xmath26 @xcite , and cs@xmath26 @xcite , and modeled by various means @xcite . in front of this intense activity ,",

    "they define a subspace of @xmath31 symmetry in hund s case _ c _ according to the corresponding interaction hamiltonian @xmath32 :    @xmath33    at large distances , both @xmath8-dependent spin - orbit coupling terms @xmath34 and @xmath35 reach the atomic value @xmath36 , where @xmath37  @xmath19 is the fine - structure splitting of the rubidium @xmath38 atomic level . in the following ,",
    "we neglect the atomic hyperfine structure , as well as the rotation of the molecule , and we restrict our study to the @xmath39 isotope . furthermore",

    "these diagonal elements and their coupling are drawn in figure [ fig : potrb2]a , and represent the diabatic representation of our problem , with two potential curves encountering a real crossing around 10@xmath17 , coupled by an off - diagonal term reaching its maximum around the same value .",

    "the resonance energies @xmath158 are located by solving the determinental equation :    @xmath159 ^{-1}y_{oc}=0 \\label{eq : detkcc}\\ ] ]    which reduces to a scalar equation in our case with one single closed channel and one single open channel . the zeroth - order energy position @xmath160 of the resonance",
    "is obtained by canceling all interaction terms in eq.[eq : detkcc ] such that :    @xmath161    using a first - order development of @xmath162 around @xmath160 in eq.[eq : detkcc ] , the resonant energy can easily be extracted as @xmath163 , with the energy shift :    @xmath164 y_{oc } \\label{eq : shift}\\ ] ]    where @xmath165 is the usual qdt bound state normalization factor @xcite :    @xmath166    and is the usual qdt bound state normalization factor ( seaton 83 ) .",
    "the associated width is then given by :    @xmath167^{-1 } y_{oc } \\label{eq : gamaqdt}\\ ] ]    the variation of the resonance widths @xmath92 with their energy @xmath89 is presented in figure [ fig : gamaold ] , as computed by both gmqdt and mfgh approaches .",
    "one can observe a good agreement between the two methods in the low - energy domain , while big discrepancies occur around 175  @xmath19 above @xmath44 .",
    "in this region , the resonance can no longer be considered as being isolated as their width become larger than the energy separation between consecutive resonances .",
    "therefore the expression of eq.[eq : gamaqdt ] no longer hold , and the apparent narrow widths computed with gmqdt no longer reflect the actual strong coupling between the two channels @xcite .",
    "for instance , their apparent widths in fig.[fig : sigmares.old ] are much smaller than the values given by eq.[eq : gamaqdt ] , which usually referred to as stabilization effect",
    ". the asymmetric ( non - lorentzian ) profiles result from interferences between neighboring overlapping resonances .",
    "energy variation of the resonance width given by eq.[eq : gamaqdt ] as a function of the energy spacing of the resonant levels .",
    "circles : mfgh ; plus signs : gmqdt.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]",
    "the apparent failure of gmqdt to properly characterize resonances in the dissociation continuum actually arises from an improper choice of the set of reference functions .",
    "indeed , we have seen in fig.[fig : ymate ] that the intuitive choice of reference functions associated to the adiabatic channels induce large @xmath13 matrix elements with strong energy variation across the dissociation threshold . in other words ,",
    "the non - adiabatic couplings are so strong that the adiabatic channels do not represent a good zeroth - order approximation in the present case .",
    "several authors have shown that an appropriate rotation of the reference functions can improve such a situation .",
    "the basic idea is to define a new @xmath13 matrix where only the off - diagonal block is not zero .",
    "in such a representation no energy shift would occur on the resonance , i.e. the coupling between the open and closed channel would be minimized . following ref.@xcite ,",
    "this goal is achieved in two steps .",
    "two successive rotations of the initial adiabatic @xmath168 and @xmath169 ( resp . @xmath170 and @xmath171 ) reference functions with a characteristic angle @xmath172 ( resp",
    "@xmath173)are applied according to :    @xmath174    with a similar equation for @xmath170 and @xmath171 with the angle @xmath173 . after each rotation , the new matrix @xmath175 is given by :    @xmath176\\\\ \\times \\left [ \\left ( \\begin{array}{cc } \\mathbf{y}_{oo}&\\mathbf{y}_{oc } \\\\ \\mathbf{y}_{co}&\\mathbf{y}_{cc } \\end{array } \\right ) \\left ( \\begin{array}{cc } \\sin \\theta_o&0 \\\\",
    "0&\\sin \\theta_c \\end{array } \\right ) + \\left ( \\begin{array}{cc } \\cos \\theta_o&0 \\\\ 0&\\cos \\theta_c \\end{array } \\right ) \\right]^{-1 } \\label{eq : yrot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath177 for the first rotation , and @xmath178 for the second one .",
    "first , the energy - dependent angle @xmath179 is chosen such that the real part of the new @xmath180 matrix associated to @xmath175 vanishes , leading to :    @xmath181    in this rotated reference set , eq.[eq : detkcc ] used to locate the resonance simply reduces to :    @xmath182    for the second step , @xmath183 is set to zero , which is fulfilled for the value @xmath184 defined by :    @xmath185    it can be easily derived from eq.[eq : yrot ] that this also ensures that @xmath186 is zero .",
    "hence , the @xmath187 matrix is well transformed into a matrix with non - vanishing off - diagonal blocks .",
    "the energy variation of this single matrix element @xmath188 is reported in fig.[fig : ymate ] .",
    "one clearly observes that the magnitude of the matrix element , associated with the rotated reference functions , is now smaller than unity .",
    "moreover its variation with the energy is much weaker than the variation observed for the off - diagonal element associated with the non - rotated reference functions .",
    "energy variation of the resonant part of the phase shift @xmath151 between the @xmath44 limit ( taken as the origin of energies ) and the @xmath45 limit .",
    "( a ) mfgh calculations ; ( b ) gmqdt calculation with optimized reference functions.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the energy variation of eigenphases of the scattering matrix determined with the optimized reference set is presented in fig.[fig : smat2 ] above .",
    "it must be noted that this result is obtained with eqs.[eq : smat ] in which @xmath189 must be replaced by @xmath190 , @xmath191 by @xmath192 and the @xmath13 matrix by its optimized counterpart . at first glance , as it should be , this variation exactly matches the one obtained with the non - rotated reference set . within this rotated frame",
    ", the analysis of the resonant contribution @xmath151 to the scattering matrix eigenphase @xmath147 reported in figure [ fig : sigmares ] , shows that the resonances now appear with the expected lorentzian profile .",
    "moreover both theoretical approaches leads to the same results for the resonance location and width .",
    "a more quantitative comparison of the width of the resonances is reported in fig.[fig : gamanew ] .",
    "the agreement between gmqdt and mfgh shows that the fermi golden rule is recovered in the rotated set of reference functions .",
    "although the collision cross - section energy variation is independent of the choice of reference functions , this application demonstrates how this choice is important for the analysis of resonances arising in the cross - section ..",
    "in this paper we emphasized on the importance of the choice of reference functions in the gmqdt treatment of collisional resonances , illustrated by the case of the photoassociation of cold atoms .",
    "in contrast with the case of interacting rydberg series , where the quantum defects are always associated with the regular and irregular coulomb functions , the present two - channel molecular problem allows several choices for the reference functions .",
    "we demonstrated that the widths of the resonances can be properly assigned provided that the reference functions are chosen in a way which minimizes the interaction with the related channels , and which ensures a weak variation of the associated quantum defect with the energy .",
    "therefore the width of the resonances can be safely deduced after the extrapolation through the dissociation threshold of the generalized quantum defects computed for the bound state spectrum .",
    "we want to stress that both set of reference functions lead to the same collisional cross - sections because they correspond to a different balance between the background ( governed by the reference functions ) and the resonant contributions to the @xmath193 matrix eigenphase .",
    "they only lead to a different analysis of the resonance showing up in the cross - sections .",
    "the non - rotated set corresponds to a strong coupling situation for which it is difficult to have predictable physical insight , while the rotated set corresponds to a more familiar and predictable weak coupling situation .    with this in mind , it is worthwhile to revisit the interpretation of the experimental results reported in ref.@xcite concerning the photoassociation of cold @xmath194rb atoms into the @xmath195 coupled states . in figure",
    "[ fig : rb87exp ] , we reported the positions of the recorded pa lines below the @xmath44 asymptote , and the energies of the corresponding levels computed with the gmqdt approach using the rotated reference functions above .",
    "we see that the molecular potentials used for the calculations provide energies in reasonable agreement with the experimental values , even if there is room for their improvement .",
    "more specifically , within the lu - fano approach @xcite used in refs.@xcite , the underlying assumption is that the reference functions are associated to the long - range adiabatic @xmath31 potentials varying as @xmath196 , even if these functions are not explicitly derived .",
    "this agreement simply means that our potential curves exhibit a long - range behavior which is close to the actual one . in this figure",
    ", the computed weight of the wave functions on the @xmath45 channel is used to yield an intensity to the lines .",
    "the resonance induced by the upper channel corresponds to the highest value of this weight . over the displayed energy range ,",
    "two of such resonances appear , separated by about 7  @xmath19 .",
    "we note however that for each of these resonances , we predict the existence of one line undetected in the experiment , marked with a star in figure [ fig : rb87exp ] .",
    "they correspond to pairs of one @xmath45 and one @xmath44 level , which are the more strongly coupled to each other .",
    "it seems that only one partner of such pairs has been identified in the experiment .",
    "such a representation is helpful to define the energy range of the @xmath44 bound spectrum which is perturbed by the interloper belonging to the @xmath45 channel .",
    "indeed , the double - sided arrows in the figure suggest that the half - width of this perturbation is equal to about 0.5  @xmath19 , in agreement with the computed half - width of the very actual resonances lying just above the @xmath44 threshold reported in figure [ fig : gamanew ] . this value is also in agreement with the energy width of the variation of the quantum defect around the resonances given in ref.@xcite . in this latter paper",
    ", the authors extrapolate their model through the dissociation limit , which is indeed justified by the present analysis .",
    "for the first resonance above @xmath44 , their quantum defect indeed varies over a half - width of about 0.4  @xmath19 .",
    "however at the predicted energy position in their signal , they assigned a broader ( 2  @xmath19 ) feature to this resonance .",
    "therefore we suggest that this feature could be revisited experimentally , as well as higher resonances , hopefully to rule out any unwanted contribution to its broadening .",
    "finally , predissociation resonances over about 35  @xmath19 below the @xmath45 threshold of @xmath197rb@xmath26 have been observed in ref.@xcite .",
    "their spectrum show a series of resonances with decreasing half - widths , which can be estimated from their figure as varying from about 0.8  @xmath19 down to about 0.02  @xmath19 close to @xmath45 .",
    "this trend is in agreement with the one visible in figure [ fig : gamanew ] , where we predict a quasi - linear decrease of the half - width in this region , from 0.06  @xmath19 down to almost zero .",
    "a more accurate determination of the half - width from raw data of ref.@xcite is desirable to better compare its amplitude and variation with our prediction .",
    "it would represent a test of the spin - orbit coupling used in the calculation . in this respect , a new perspective for the present analysis",
    "is offered by the recent determination of the potential curves and spin - orbit coupling of the @xmath48 coupled system in rb@xmath26 , extracted from the compilation of several high - resolution spectroscopic data @xcite .",
    "indeed , the present calculations could be run again with these new accurate data , in order to predict the predissociation width over the whole energy range between @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and hopefully confirm the interpretation of the pa results of ref.@xcite .",
    "energies of the bound states of the @xmath194rb@xmath26 @xmath198 coupled states computed within the gmqdt framework with optimized reference functions ( see text ) , compared to experimental results of ref.@xcite , below the @xmath44 asymptote taken as the origin of energies .",
    "intensities of the vertical lines represent the weight of the @xmath45 channel in the gmqdt results .",
    "experimental results are weighted by the same quantity , for convenience .",
    "crosses indicate missing data in the experimental signal due to technical reasons .",
    "stars indicate levels predicted by our model , which are not detected in the experiment .",
    "double - sided arrows indicate the approximate energy width of the perturbation induced by levels of the @xmath45 channel in the @xmath44 channel.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]",
