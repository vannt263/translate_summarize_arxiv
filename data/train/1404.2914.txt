    "since the first spectroscopic survey for intervening quasar damped ly@xmath0 ( dla ) absorption - line systems ( wolfe et al .",
    "1986 ) , it has been recognized that these gaseous regions with neutral hydrogen column densities @xmath8 atoms @xmath7 can be used to trace the neutral gas component of the universe .",

    "the most recent extensive results from low - redshift uv and high - redshift optical dla surveys have been presented by rao , turnshek , & nestor ( 2006 ; hereafter rtn2006 ) and noterdaeme et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , respectively .",
    "relative to rtn2006 ( 41 dlas in their statistical sample ) , meiring et al .",

    "( 1993 ) found in the hst fos uv qso absorption - line key project blind survey ( 1 dla ) , but both uv blind surveys suffer from small number statistics .",
    "most recently , noterdaeme et al . (",
    "2014 ) present a study of @xmath12 extremely strong high - redshift dlas , with @xmath13 atoms @xmath7 . aside from statistical results on the dla incidence ( product of absorber cross - section and their comoving number density ) and the cosmic mass density of neutral gas",
    ", many interesting facets of galaxy formation and evolution can be considered through follow - up studies of dla metallicities , dust , molecular fractions , star formation , kinematics , associated galaxies , and clustering as a function of redshift .",
    "these topics in dla research have been widely discussed in the literature , but it is not the purpose of this paper to summarize them ( see wolfe et al .",
    "2005 for a past review ) .    here",
    ", we simply wish to emphasize that while follow - up studies of dlas are providing a wealth of information about the neutral - gas - phase component of the universe , reasonably accurate statistical measurements in any relatively narrow low - redshift interval have remained elusive . by low redshift",
    "we mean redshifts @xmath1 , for which the ly@xmath0 line falls in the uv .",
    "for example , the low - redshift dla survey of rtn2006 probed @xmath1 .",
    "this redshift regime corresponds to @xmath14 70 per cent ( @xmath15 gyrs ) of the most recent history of the universe , where significant evolution is known to have occurred .",
    "but since observation of a low - redshift ly@xmath0 line requires space - based uv spectroscopy , the number of confirmed dlas remains relatively small in all narrow low - redshift intervals ( e.g. , in cosmic time intervals corresponding to @xmath16 to @xmath17 gyrs ) .",
    "even with the efficient strong -- selected dla survey method used by rtn2006 , only 9 dlas have been previously confirmed at @xmath18 $ ] . this redshift interval spans @xmath3 gyr in cosmic time , @xmath4 $ ] gyrs after the big bang .",
    "a number of years ago , when stis had failed and cos was not yet installed on hst , we had the opportunity to perform a large strong -- selected survey for dlas at @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "this is a very efficient way to conduct a dla survey since any biases can be accounted for if the statistics of  absorption - line systems are well understood ( rtn2006 ) .",
    "this redshift interval was chosen because it is well - matched to the sensitivity of hst s low - resolution acs - hrc - pr200l prism . to demonstrate this ,",
    "figure 1 shows the ly@xmath0 damping profiles for a range of dla @xmath5 values within this redshift interval at full resolution and at the resolution of a prism spectrum .",
    "the prism has nonlinear dispersion so that a prism spectrum of a ly@xmath0 line at @xmath19 has resolution @xmath20/@xmath21 ( 4.4   pixel@xmath9 at 1726  ) , while at @xmath22 it has @xmath20/@xmath23 ( 10.6   pixel@xmath9 at 2067  ) . with this in mind , we undertook prism observations of the uv ly@xmath0 absorption lines in 109 strong-  systems to determine if they exhibited an absorption profile with damping wings .",
    "the data collection on these 109 systems required 105 single - orbit observations since four of the quasars had two systems .    of the 109 strong-  systems in our sample that were observed with the prism",
    ", we found that only 97 of them had observations that were usable in our dla search .",
    "we also obtained spectroscopy of three quasars with known dlas ( `` dla calibrators '' ) to confirm our ability to recognize and measure dlas .",
    "in general , if a ly@xmath0 line does not exhibit a significant damping profile ( i.e. , if @xmath5 is too low in a  system ) , it would be undetectable or nearly undetectable in its prism spectrum .",
    "thus , prism observations offer a suitable method for distinguishing dlas from non - dlas .     and @xmath22 for a low @xmath5 value of @xmath24 atoms @xmath7 and a high @xmath5 value of @xmath25 atoms @xmath7 .",
    "the smooth red profiles ( see online version ) are the normalized theoretical dla absorption - line profiles .",
    "the black profiles are the expected spectra at the resolution of the prism .",
    "note the poorer resolution at higher redshift .",
    "also , the redshift range of our usable observations is taken to be @xmath2 $ ] , however at @xmath26 ( see the top right panel ) the short wavelength side of a high-@xmath5 dla will begin to become impossible to measure reliably over the expected range in @xmath5 values since the prism calibration does not extend below @xmath27  . ]",
    "below we describe the results of our hst observations with the primary goal of identifying new dlas ( @xmath28 atoms @xmath7 ) at @xmath2 $ ] . our method to achieve",
    "this was simply to examine the prism spectra at the predicted locations of the ly@xmath0 absorption lines in strong-  absorption - line systems .",
    "rest equivalent widths @xmath29  , however , the systems we study here generally have rest equivalent widths @xmath30  . ]",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we present the details of our observational program and data processing for the observed strong-  systems . in",
    "3 we present @xmath5 results for the 36 systems which , based on the prism spectra , have a significant or an interesting probability of being dlas , along with results on the three dla calibrators . in ",
    "4 we conclude with a short discussion of the significance of our results . the implications of these results for measurements of the incidence and cosmic mass density of neutral gas will be discussed in a future paper by rao et al .",
    "the sdss  systems that were chosen for hst prism observations were selected as follows .",
    "first , based on preliminary results on the sensitivity of the acs - hrc - pr200l prism , we decided that it was possible to use it to identify and measure dlas with @xmath31 $ ] in the spectra of sufficiently bright quasars .",
    "second , we used an early version of the pittsburgh sdss quasar  absorption - line survey catalog ( see quider et al . 2011 ) to identify all  systems in this redshift interval that met the following quasar brightness and metal - line absorption criteria : ( 1 ) quasar sdss g - band mag brighter than @xmath32 and ( 2 )  rest equivalent width @xmath33  , which generally ( not always ) is consistent with having  rest equivalent width @xmath34   ( but in cases with @xmath35 information on @xmath36 is unavailable or unreliable in sdss spectra )",
    ". some of the identified quasars also had weaker  systems in their spectra , and these appear in table 1 .",
    "additionally , we removed absorption systems from this sample if the predicted location of the dla would lie too close to broad ly@xmath37@xmath38  emission in the quasar spectrum ( within @xmath39 km s@xmath9 ) , since this could cause unnecessary confusion when measuring any dlas in the low - resolution prism spectra . to achieve our desired final sample size",
    "we then decided to limit our observations to include only quasars with g - band magnitudes brighter than @xmath40 .",
    "unfortunately , it turned out that the sensitivity of the prism was only sufficient to identify dlas at @xmath2 $ ] ; in the end , five observations of  systems with @xmath41 were made but were unusable for a dla search .",
    "the findings and methods discussed in rtn2006 can be used with the above selection criteria , and with the results of this study , to arrive at an independent determination of the incidence and cosmic mass density of neutral gas at @xmath2 $ ] . as noted in the introduction ,",
    "this will be quantified in the future paper by rao et al .",
    "the future rao et al .",
    "paper will also incorporate results on other uv surveys for dlas .",
    "table 1 presents the sample of 109 strong-  absorbers observed at the location of ly@xmath0 with hst s low - resolution acs - hrc - pr200l prism .",
    "included for each  absorber in table 1 are the sdss quasar s j2000 name , the total exposure time for the prism observation , the quasar s g - band magnitude , and the quasar s emission redshift ; this information is taken from the most recent entries found in the sdss dr7 and dr9 quasar catalogs of schneider et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and pris et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , respectively . also included in table 1 is information on the metal - line absorption properties for each strong-  absorber using results from the online version of the pittsburgh sdss quasar  absorption - line survey catalog of quider et al .",
    "this includes the  absorption redshift and metal - line absorption rest equivalent widths and errors for @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "finally , this same information is listed at the end of table 1 for each of the three quasar `` dla calibrators '' with known @xmath5 ( see rao et al . 2003 and rtn2006 ) , which were also observed with the prism .",
    "we chose to observe these three dlas because they covered a range of a factor of @xmath46 in  column density , and we wanted to assess how well their  column densities could be re - determined over this range . in table 1",
    "we adopt the naming convention used in rao et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and rtn2006 for these calibrators but note that q1629 + 120 is j163145.17 + 115603.3 , q2328 + 0022 is j232820.38 + 002238.2 , and q2353@xmath470028 is j235321.62@xmath47002840.6 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the 38 continuum - normalized prism spectra , f@xmath48 , and associated error arrays , @xmath49 ( derived using the axe software ) , are shown in figure 3 .",
    "they were used to measure ly@xmath0 in 39 strong-  systems .",
    "two of the systems are present in the prism spectrum of j090757.59 + 421823.6 .",
    "the first 36 systems in figure 3 ( in right ascension order ) are those from our new sample which were found to have a significant ( 35 with status code a ) or interesting ( one with status code d ) probability of being dlas .",
    "the last three spectra in figure 3 are of the dla calibrator quasars ( status code e ) .    establishing the continuua levels in low - resolution dla",
    "survey spectra has , unfortunately , always been somewhat of an art . with a low - resolution spectrum",
    "there is the problem of unresolved absorption blends of ly@xmath0 forest lines .",
    "an additional complication is the non - linear dispersion ( resolution ) in a slitless prism spectrum , which results in an asymmetric dla profile ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "fortunately , the  column density is uniquely determined by the absorption rest equivalent width and , for a given continuum , a voigt profile fit convolved with the instrument dispersion solution gives a unique value for the column density .",
    "thus , setting the continuum level properly is important , and we have carefully considered the various relevant issues .",
    "continuum placement was a matter of identifying emission - line free regions on both sides ( or sometimes only one side ) of the predicted location of any dla line , and then judging where the continuum was at the relevant wavelength . given the varying properties of the background quasar spectra , the procedure necessarily changed from absorption system to absorption system .",
    "note that , in some cases , the regions used to set the continuum level may not be included in the plots . as an extra precaution",
    ", the first three authors of this paper thoroughly examined the possibly ambiguous cases by looking at prism images and extracted spectra ( before addition ) to evaluate whether a continuum placement was reasonable .",
    "as an example , it s worth noting that the apparent excess emission to the red of the dla in j083900.67 + 370901.4 is in fact real broad emission due to ly@xmath37@xmath38  in the quasar , and not an artifact of continuum placement .",
    "another example is in j084200.76 + 333214.8 ; its spectrum becomes noisy on the short wavelength end of the spectrum , and that part was not used to set the continuum .    to determine @xmath5 values , theoretical ly@xmath0 voigt profiles",
    "were shifted to the  absorption redshifts and convolved to the prism resolution using the axe task `` simdata . ''",
    "the resulting simulated spectra were then adjusted to match the continuua slopes of the extracted prism spectra and overlaid to determine ( by eye ) the best - fitting @xmath5 values .",
    "the voigt profiles that were judged to produce the best fits to the observed damped profiles are shown in figure 3 as solid red lines ( online version ) relative to the unit continuum levels shown as black dashed lines near the dlas .",
    "we were able to check the validity of the axe derivations of @xmath49 for the vast majority of the spectra in figure 3 .",
    "we did this by comparing the two individual f@xmath48 spectra to derive an empirical error array , @xmath50 .",
    "in most cases @xmath49 and @xmath50 were found to be consistent , but in some cases they were not .",
    "as discussed below , when there was a significant discrepancy , this led us to use a larger continuum placement error to estimate the error in @xmath5 .    to determine the error in @xmath5 a spectrum was re - normalized by dividing by 1@xmath51@xmath49 or 1@xmath51@xmath50 ( whichever was larger ) , and the damped profiles were re - fit with voigt profiles to determine the likely range in @xmath5 .",
    "generally the @xmath51@xmath52 errors were not symmetric , so the adopted value for @xmath52 was taken to be the one with the largest absolute value .",
    "finally , in some cases tests indicated that resulting errors in @xmath5 for lower @xmath5 systems were unrealistically low , and we concluded that we should never report the error in @xmath5 to be @xmath5320 per cent for a system with @xmath54 atoms @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , in those cases we report a 20 per cent error .",
    "our derivations of @xmath5 using the prism spectra of the three dla calibrators ( see the last three entries in table 2 and their footnotes ) confirm that the algorithm we used to report the @xmath52 values is reasonable and consistent with known results .",
    "note that the algorithmic @xmath55 error we report for 2353@xmath470028cal is smaller than the error reported in rtn2006 .",
    "also , it should be mentioned that some of our determined @xmath5 percentage errors are smaller than typical @xmath5 errors derived from analyses of sdss spectra ( e.g. , noterdaeme et al . 2009 ) .",
    "this may seem surprising given the differences in data quality and resolution in these two very different spectral data sets .",
    "however , it is also the case that ly@xmath0 forest absorption is both more frequent and problematic at the higher redshifts probed by the sdss spectra .    the final results are given in table 2 .",
    "the redshifts in table 2 are those measured from  absorption in the sdss spectra , since measuring a redshift from a damped absorption line in a prism spectrum is not as accurate .",
    "the @xmath5 value for j134050.87 + 642544.9 ( the one status code d absorption system ) is taken to be at least @xmath6 atoms @xmath7 based on the assumption that only the long - wavelength side of the damping profile is visible in the prism spectrum ; however , this @xmath5 value is so large that it is unlikely to be present in a sample of our size , so this might not in fact be a dla .",
    "we note that in the large high - redshift dla samples identified by noterdaeme et al .",
    "( 2012 , 2014 ) using sdss spectra , only one in a thousand had @xmath56 atoms @xmath7 .",
    "the main results of our study are presented in table 2 , namely the identification of 36 new , high-@xmath5 systems that have a significant or interesting probability of being dlas at @xmath2 $ ] , which is a relatively narrow low - redshift cosmic time interval corresponding to @xmath4 $ ] gyrs after the big bang .",
    "while some cosmic evolution might be expected over this small interval , any evolutionary effects and observational biases would be minimal in comparison to the alternative of working over the entire redshift interval covered by uv spectra , i.e. , @xmath1 , which corresponds to the most recent @xmath15 gyrs of the history of the universe .    given the availability of the sample presented here , we suggest that observational biases and possible evolutionary effects could be more easily treated if future observational studies of low - redshift dlas were concentrated within the @xmath57 $ ] redshift interval .. $ ] ] for comparison , the very large sample of high - redshift dlas identified by noterdaeme et al . (",
    "2012 ) at @xmath58 $ ] corresponds to a cosmic time interval of @xmath59 gyr , which is @xmath60 $ ] gyrs after the big bang .",
    "noterdaeme et al . (",
    "2012 ) do find clear evidence for cosmic evolution , but cosmic evolution of dlas appears to be more rapid at higher redshifts .",
    "it is important to note that , given that the @xmath5 values were derived using low - resolution prism spectra , the present work would clearly benefit from improved uv spectroscopy to more accurately determine the @xmath5 values .",
    "such results would , of course , be beneficial to any follow - up work .    in any case , this new list of `` dlas '' at @xmath2 $ ] is valuable for future follow - up studies of the neutral gas component of the universe ( e.g. , metallicities , dust , molecular fractions , star formation , kinematics , associated galaxies , and clustering environment ) .",
    "the low redshifts and size of the sample makes it unique for the purpose of identifying associated `` dla galaxies , '' which has proved to be very difficult and sporadic at high redshift .",
    "truly comprehensive studies of this sample would provide a framework for describing dlas and their connections to galaxies that theory would have to explain .",
    "we hope that observers pursue this challenge .",
