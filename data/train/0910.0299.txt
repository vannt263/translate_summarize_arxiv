    "a recent article was devoted to an infinite family of quantum systems on a plane described by the hamiltonian : @xmath3 where @xmath1 is an arbitrary real number and @xmath4 are polar coordinates @xcite .",
    "these systems were shown to be exactly solvable and integrable for all values of @xmath1 .",
    "integrability is assured by the existence of a second order integral of motion @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the two - dimensional angular momentum .",
    "the existence of the integral @xmath7 implies the separation of variables in polar coordinates in the schrodinger equation in quantum mechanics and also in the hamilton - jacobi equation in classical mechanics .",
    "superintegrability in a two - dimensional system means that one further integral of motion exists .",
    "let us call it @xmath8 .",
    "it was conjectured in our previous article @xcite that the system ( [ h ] ) is superintegrable for all integer values of @xmath1 and that the additional integral of motion is of order @xmath9 .",
    "this conjecture was proven for @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "if @xmath12 or @xmath13 , it was proven for @xmath14 to 6 and 8 . for @xmath15 and @xmath16 , the system ( [ h ] )",
    "reduces to known superintegrable systems . for @xmath14 , this is one of the 4 systems found in @xcite , for @xmath17 it was found in @xcite and for @xmath18 in @xcite .    in all cases",
    "( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) the quantum hamiltonian and the other quantum integrals of motion lie in the enveloping algebra of an underlying hidden lie algebra @xcite and this is presumably true for all integer values of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this article is to analyze the corresponding classical system with hamiltonian : @xmath19 we show that all bounded trajectories for this system are closed and that the motion is periodic for all integer and rational values of @xmath1 .",
    "we recall that in general , in an @xmath20-dimensional space , maximal superintegrability means that the classical hamiltonian allows @xmath21 functionally independant integrals of motion ( including the hamiltonian ) that are well defined functions on phase space . in classical mechanics",
    "maximal superintegrability implies that all bounded trajectories are closed and the motion is periodic @xcite . the corresponding statement in quantum mechanics",
    "is that the existence of a non - abelian algebra of integrals of motion implies that the energy levels of the system are degenerate . in the two dimensional case that means that the energy depends on one quantum number , the wave function on two",
    "this is indeed the case for the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) for all integer values of @xmath1 and is part of the justification of our conjecture @xcite .    in section 2",
    "we integrate the hamilton - jacobi equation for arbitrary values of @xmath1 in polar coordinates , restricting to the case of bounded trajectories . in section 3",
    "we obtain an explicit expression for the bounded trajectories in terms of chebyshev polynomials and show that they are all closed for integer and rational values of @xmath1 . the period in time",
    "is @xmath2 . for integer @xmath1 with @xmath22 ,",
    "up to @xmath23 singular points can occur on the trajectories in with the tangent vector is not defined .",
    "the special case @xmath14 is discussed in detail in section 4 .",
    "this is the only case in which the hamilton - jacobi equation separates in a second coordinate system , namely in cartesian coordinates .",
    "section 5 is devoted to examples of trajectories illustrating all features presented in the earlier sections .",
    "the hamilton - jacobi equation for the considered system in polar coordinates has the form @xmath24 we set the integral of motion ( [ x_k ] ) equal to a constant @xmath25 . since coordinates in ( [ hj ] )",
    "separate we look for a solution in which the classical action has the form @xmath26 and obtain @xmath27    since we are interested in the trajectories we do not need to solve for @xmath28 and @xmath29 , though that is obviously possible .",
    "instead we follow the usual procedure @xcite and calculate the derivatives of @xmath30 with respect to @xmath31 and @xmath25 .",
    "we have @xmath32 and hence @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are constants .      from ( [ s1 ] ) and ( [ delta1 ] ) we have @xmath36 the roots of the denominator are @xmath37 bounded motion @xmath38",

    "for @xmath46 the integral ( 2.9 ) must be evaluated differently and we obtain @xmath47 we see that the trajectories for @xmath48 are not bounded , independently of the values of alpha and beta .",

    "we have @xmath69    once @xmath70 is known as a function of @xmath71 we obtain @xmath72 as @xmath73    we rewrite ( [ arcsin ] ) as @xmath74 with @xmath75 equation ( [ arccos ] ) can be converted into an algebraic equation for @xmath70 in term of @xmath76 .",
    "we use the well - known formula @xcite for the chebyshev polynomials @xmath77 for @xmath78 and obtain @xmath79    we see that we can restrict the values of @xmath80 to @xmath81 since the interval @xmath82 will give the same trajectories .",
    "let us write ( [ tkr ] ) as a polynomial equation with real coefficients for @xmath70 ( and thus for @xmath42 ) .",
    "we do this separatly for even and odd values of @xmath1 and obtain @xmath83    the crucial point is that ( 3.11 ) does not contain any multivalued functions .",
    "it follows that @xmath84 and ultimately @xmath72 is a periodic function with the same period @xmath85 as @xmath76 namely @xmath86 and @xmath87 hence all bounded trajectories are closed and the motion is periodic .",
    "we stress that @xmath86 is the period of @xmath88 as a function of @xmath71 .",
    "both @xmath88 and @xmath71 are periodic in time @xmath89 with the same period , namely @xmath90 ( see ( 2.12 ) ) and this period does not depend on @xmath1 and coincides with that of the harmonic oscillator .    alternative ( and equivalent ) equations for the trajectories can be obtained . if we solve ( 3.10 ) for @xmath91",
    "we obtain @xmath92    since we have @xmath93 we can define @xmath94 by putting @xmath95 and rewrite ( 3.10 ) as @xmath96    in section 4 we shall plot the bounded trajectories for low values of @xmath1 .",
    "the equation for the trajectories then simplify and we have @xmath97    the trajectories are always closed curves within the sectors ( 2.20 ) . they can never actually reach the boundaries of the sectors , unless we have @xmath12 or @xmath13 ( or both ) . the trajectories degenerate into line segments for @xmath98 ( see ( 3.10 ) ) .",
    "the length of the segment is determined by the limits ( 3.4 ) and ( 3.5 ) which must be imposed .",
    "let us consider a curve given in polar coordinates .",
    "singular points on the curve are those where the derivative @xmath99 is not defined .",
    "they satisfy the overdetermined system of equations : @xmath100    in our case the equation of the curve is @xmath101 and the derivatives satisfy @xmath102r^{2(m - j)}\\frac{d r}{d r } \\end{split}\\\\   \\frac{\\partial f_{k}}{\\partial \\varphi}&=\\frac{\\cos c\\sqrt{1-u_k^2}\\pm u_k\\sin c}{\\sqrt{1-u_k^2}}\\frac{d u_k}{d \\varphi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from equation ( 3.3 ) we see that @xmath103 vanishes only for @xmath104 and @xmath105 only for @xmath106 , @xmath107 . these values correspond to points that do not lie on a trajectory .",
    "the singular points satisfy @xmath108 that is @xmath109 and one of equations ( 3.23 ) for @xmath1 even or odd respectively .    from ( 3.23 ) we see that @xmath110 is a polynomial of order @xmath23 and will hence have @xmath23 zeros , all of them real .",
    "these zeros are actually singular points if the corresponding values of @xmath88 and @xmath71 lie on the trajectories ( see ( 3.21 ) ) .",
    "this in turn depends on the constants @xmath25 , @xmath80 and @xmath31 i.e. on the initial conditions ( for @xmath111 and @xmath45 given ) .",
    "the statement thus is : the number @xmath112 of singular points on the trajectories satisfies @xmath113    for small values of @xmath1 these formulas give :    for @xmath114 @xmath115 there are no singular points .",
    "+ for @xmath116 @xmath117 the possible singular point corresponds to @xmath118 .",
    "+ for @xmath119 @xmath120 the two possible singular points are @xmath121 i.e. @xmath122    for @xmath123 @xmath124 the three possible singular points are @xmath125 and @xmath126 i.e. @xmath127      in the last subsection , we obtained the equation for the trajectories for integer values of @xmath1 .",
    "we have established that those trajectories for the hamiltonian ( 1.3 ) are bounded if the constants of the system satisfy condtions ( 3.1 ) .",
    "now let us obtain the trajectories when @xmath1 is rational .    here",
    "we set @xmath128 for @xmath129 integers .",
    "the bounded trajectories in this case are obtained under the same conditions on the constants of the system as those specified in the preceding subsection ( 3.1 ) .",
    "equation ( 3.7 ) becomes @xmath130    using identity ( 3.9 ) we obtain @xmath131    following the same arguments as in subsection 3.1 , we see that @xmath84 and @xmath72 are periodic functions of the angle @xmath71 of period @xmath132 .",
    "again all bounded trajectories are closed and the motion is periodic .    in section 5 we will present the trajectories for the rational values @xmath133 .",
    "the trajectories given by ( 3.10 ) or ( 3.11 ) ( see also ( 3.16)-(3.19 ) ) and ( 3.27 ) depend on three quantities @xmath31 , @xmath25 and @xmath80 . @xmath31 and @xmath25 are values of the energy @xmath134 ( 2.1 ) and the integral of motion @xmath7 ( 2.4 ) .",
    "the third integral @xmath8 , responsible for superintegrability has so far not figured explicitly and is related to the constant @xmath80 . the quantities @xmath25 and @xmath31",
    "are restricted by relations ( 3.1 ) in order for the trajectories to be bounded .",
    "we allow @xmath80 to take values @xmath81 .",
    "the trajectories could also be calculated differently , using all three integrals of motion and just one of the newton equations of motion .",
    "this may impose further conditions on the parameters involved .",
    "we discuss this in detail for @xmath14 in section 4 .",
    "the bounded trajectories for @xmath14 are given by ( 3.16 ) with @xmath135 and @xmath136 defined in ( 3.3 ) .",
    "the case @xmath14 differs from that of all other values of @xmath1 by the fact that the additional integral of motion @xmath8 for @xmath14 is second order in the momenta and hence also leads to the separation of variables in the hamilton - jacobi equation .",
    "explicitly we have @xcite @xmath137 so @xmath138 is the energy related to motion in the @xmath139 direction ( equally well we could have put @xmath140 or @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the energy related to motion in @xmath143 direction ) .",
    "the hamilton - jacobi equation in this case is multiseparable .",
    "namely it separates in polar coordinates ( for any @xmath1 ) and cartesian ones ( for @xmath14 ) .",
    "for @xmath14 it also separates in elliptic coordinates with an arbitrary focal distance of @xmath144 .",
    "the equations of motion were solved in cartesian coordinates @xcite and the solution corrresponding to bounded trajectories in the notations of the present article are @xmath145\\\\ \\label{trajy } y^2=\\frac{e_2}{2\\omega^2}+\\frac{1}{2\\omega^2}\\sqrt{e_2 ^ 2 - 4\\beta\\omega^2}\\sin[4\\omega ( t+c_2)]\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] above we have @xmath146 and @xmath147 , @xmath148 are integration constants . from ( [ trajx ] ) and ( [ trajy ] ) we see that the trajectories are bounded and closed .",
    "they lie inside a rectangle @xmath149    we see that @xmath150    eliminating @xmath89 from ( [ trajx ] ) and ( [ trajy ] ) we obtain an equation for the trajectories , namely @xmath151 \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath152 .",
    "this equation is a fourth order polynomial equation involving the coordinates @xmath139 and @xmath143 . viewing @xmath139 as a parameter for the curve we note that it must satisfy ( 4.5 ) .",
    "the curve ( 4.7 ) has four branches , each lying entirely within one quadrant of the @xmath153 plane . for @xmath154 and @xmath155 it can never reach the coordinate axes ( see ( 4.4 ) and ( 4.5 ) ) .    in the limiting cases when @xmath156 the closed curve ( 4.7 ) collapses into a segment of a quadric . for @xmath157",
    "this is a segment of a hyperbola and for @xmath158 a segment of an ellipse ( always inside the rectangle ( 4.4 ) and ( 4.5 ) ) .    the trajectory ( 3.16 ) in polar coordinates",
    "can be made more explicit namely @xmath159    again this is a fourth order polynomial curve ( in @xmath88 and @xmath160 ) that degenerates into a segment of a quadric for @xmath161 . considering @xmath162 as a parameter of the curve we must restrict to the interval ( 3.4 ) .",
    "the trajectories given by ( 4.7 ) and ( 4.8 ) must coincide .",
    "this gives a relationship between cartesian constants @xmath163 and the polar constants @xmath164 .",
    "we calculate @xmath165 and @xmath166 from ( 4.2 ) and ( 4.3 ) and compare @xmath165 from ( 2.12 ) and @xmath166 from ( 3.16 ) . for given total energy @xmath31 ( and @xmath167 )",
    "we obtain @xmath168 and @xmath169    the condition @xmath170 is not necessarily automatically satisfied by the right hand side of ( 4.10 ) and imposes further conditions .",
    "first of all , the denominator in ( 4.10 ) must be the square root of a positive number which implies @xmath171    secondly , the equation @xmath172 is a quadratic polynomial in @xmath25 and @xmath173 @xmath174    an example of the corresponding curve in the @xmath175 plane is given on fig .",
