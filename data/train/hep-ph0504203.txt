    "in our previous papers  @xcite , we calculated the contribution of kaluza - klein ( kk ) gravireggeons into the scattering of four - dimensional sm particles in a model with @xmath6 compact extra spatial dimensions ( the add model  @xcite ) .",
    "the results were applied to the scattering of cosmic neutrinos off nucleons at superplanckian neutrino energy @xmath7 .    at @xmath8 , the cross sections related with gravity interactions appeared to be compatible with ( larger than ) sm cross sections at @xmath9 , depending on @xmath7 . the gravitational part of the cross section induced by the gravireggeon exchange rises rapidly with a decrease of @xmath6 .",
    "for instance , for @xmath10 , it is approximately two orders of magnitude larger than the sm contribution to the cross section  @xcite , if the gravity scale is chosen to be @xmath11 tev .",
    "unfortunately , present astrophysical bounds  @xcite rule out the possibility @xmath10 and significantly restrict the parameter space for @xmath12 . the case @xmath13 is completely excluded since a radius of a single extra dimension , @xmath2 , exceeds the size of the universe , if we insist that a fundamental gravity scale in five dimensions , @xmath5 , should be 1 tev or so .",
    "it follows from the relation @xmath14 , with @xmath15 being a @xmath16-dimensional reduced planck scale ( @xmath17 )",
    ".    however , the above mentioned astrophysical bounds do not apply to the extra dimensions with a warped metric . in the present paper we consider a model of gravity in a slice of a 5-dimensional anti - de sitter space ( ads@xmath18 ) with a single extra dimension compactified to the orbifold @xmath19 ( the rs model  @xcite ) .",
    "we consider a special case when a curvature of the metric @xmath1 space is given by @xmath20 . ]",
    "is much smaller than the gravity scale @xmath5 .",
    "we demonstrate that in such a limit the expression for inelastic cross section for a collision of the brane particles in _ warped five dimensions _ can be obtained from the analogous expression previously derived in _ five flat dimensions _ by a formal substitution @xmath21 .",
    "then numerical calculations show that the gravity ( gravireggeon ) contribution to the scattering of the brane fields should dominate the sm contribution even for rather large @xmath5 .",
    "in the rs model , the warped metric is of the form : @xmath22 here @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) , @xmath25 being a `` radius '' of extra dimension , and parameter @xmath1 defines the scalar curvature of the space .",
    "we are interested in so - called rs1 model  @xcite which has two 3-dimensional branes with equal and opposite tensions located at the point @xmath26 ( called the _ tev brane _ , or _ visible brane _ ) and at @xmath27 ( referred to as the _ plank brane _ ) . if @xmath28 , then the tension on the tev brane is negative , whereas the tension on the planck brane is positive .",
    "all sm fields are constrained to the tev 4d brane , while the gravity propagates in all five dimensions ( bulk ) .    from an effective 4-dimensional action one can derive the relation  @xcite : @xmath29 which means that @xmath30 in this case , @xmath5 being a 5-dimensional reduced planck scale .",
    "the kinetic energy in the visible brane action is not canonically normalized .",
    "after re - scaling the fields , the warp factor appears in a mass term : @xmath31 as a result , the masses of the kaluza - klein ( kk ) graviton excitations are given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 are zeros of the bessel function @xmath34 .",
    "note , here and in what follows we are interested in a case @xmath35 , neglecting terms @xmath36 with respect to 1 .",
    "the interaction lagrangian on the brane with a negative tension looks like - channel exchanges they are irrelevant . ]",
    "@xmath37 here @xmath38 is the energy - momentum tensor of the matter on the brane , @xmath39 is the graviton field with a kk - number @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the physical scale on the tev brane . it can be chosen as small as 1 tev for a thick slice of the ads@xmath18 , @xmath42 we see from that couplings of all massive states are suppressed by @xmath43 only , while the zero mode couples with usual strength defined by the reduced planck mass @xmath44 .",
    "the relation guarantees that the masses of lowest graviton kk excitations   are closed to one tev .",
    "thus , the phenomenology of models with non - factorizable metric is associated with the resonant kk spectrum in the tev region  @xcite .",
    "let us note , that because of the warp factor @xmath45 on the tev brane , the coordinates @xmath46 are not galilean .",
    "one can , however , introduces the galilean coordinates @xmath47 and rewrite both the gravitational field and the energy - momentum tensor in these coordinates ( see , for instance , reviews @xcite ) .",
    "then the warp factor is equal to 1 at the negative tension brane , and a correct determination of the masses on this brane can be achieved  @xcite . by calculating the zero mode sector of the effective theory one",
    "thus obtains : @xmath48    in such a case , we have the following mass spectrum on the negative tension brane : @xmath49 to get @xmath50 tev , the parameters of the model are usually taken to be @xmath51 tev . because of the relation @xmath52^{-1 } + \\mathrm{o \\left ( n^{-2 } \\right)},\\ ] ] the kk states are equally spaced at large @xmath40 .",

    "indeed , the substitution @xmath56 , @xmath57 provides us with the same mass spectrum of the massive gravitons and the same coupling of the kk gravitons to the sm fields .",
    "nevertheless , the correct statement is that the masses of the kk gravitons , as seen by an observer living on the brane with the negative tension , are defined by eq .",
    "@xcite . on the other brane ,",
    "their values are defined by eq .  .",
    "moreover , all bulk fields , not only gravitons , look differently to observers on different branes .",
    "the observed masses for brane fields coincide with their lagrangian values and do not depend on coordinate rescaling , if covariant equations and invariant distances are used  @xcite .    generally speaking , we have _ three _ dimensional parameters in the rs model : fundamental gravity scale in 5 dimensions , @xmath5 , the curvature scale , @xmath1 , and the size of extra dimension , @xmath25 .",
    "they obey only _ two _ conditions .",
    "indeed , to get tev physics , one fixes @xmath5 to be one or few tev .",

    "@xmath1 which result in an unnaturally large coupling constant @xmath53 should be avoided in order not to introduce a new mass scale in the theory . ]",
    "thus , there is a possibility to consider a case in which @xmath1 is larger than @xmath58 , but is much smaller than @xmath5 .",
    "it was recently demonstrated in ref .",

    "it is not surprising that the relations and are reproduced in this scheme .",
    "following @xcite , the mass splitting ( @xmath64 ) can be chosen to be smaller than the energy resolution of collider experiments .",
    "we take @xmath65 mev for phenomenological purposes .",

    "such space warping gives a model which has the ultraviolet properties of the add model with a single extra dimensions  @xcite , but it evades the contradiction with available astrophysical bounds .",

    "<S> the inelastic scattering of the brane fields induced by @xmath0-channel gravireggeons exchanges in the rs model with a small curvature @xmath1 is considered , and the imaginary part of the eikonal is analytically calculated . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that the results can be obtained from the corresponding formulae previously derived in the add model with one extra dimension of the size @xmath2 by formal replacement @xmath3 . </S>",
