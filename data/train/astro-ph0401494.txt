    "gaia is the ambitious flagship mission approved by esa for a launch not later than 2012 , and possibly already by q2 of 2010 .",
    "the mission is designed to obtain extremely precise astrometry ( in the _ micro-_arcsec regime ) , multi - band photometry and medium / high resolution spectroscopy for a large sample of stars .",
    "the goals call for astrometry and photometry ( 5 broad and 11 medium bands covering the optical range ) to be complete over the whole sky to @xmath6 , and spectroscopy complete to @xmath7 . the spectroscopy is primarily meant to provide the radial velocities and thus the 6@xmath8 component in the phase - space to complement the other five provided by astrometry .",
    "each star will be visited around a hundred times during the five year mission life - time , in a fashion similar to the highly successful _ hipparcos _ scanning mode .",
    "the spectra , photometry and astrometry acquired at each transit _ epoch _ will be individually accessible .",
    "gaia has three telescopes / fields of view , roughly equally spaced over a great circle on the sky , so that every @xmath32 hours along the 6 hours spin period , the same star will cross the field of view of astro-1 ( where astrometric position and magnitude in 5 broad bands are measured ) , of astro-2 ( identical to astro-1 ) , and of the spectro - photometric telescope ( where spectra and photometry in @xmath311 medium bands are collected ) .",
    "hipparcos performed photometry in three bands .",
    "@xmath9 , a sort of white light covering the johnson s @xmath10 and @xmath11 bands , has been the most accurate , with individual measurements accurate to 0.01 mag for solar type stars brighter than @xmath12 .",
    "the other two bands , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , were significantly less accurate .",
    "gaia will carry instead a fully featured photometric system , composed of a set of 5 broad and @xmath311 medium bands , which are still under fine optimization .",
    "figure  1 illustrates the expected errors on the magnitudes derived at each passage in the gaia fields of view for three sample broad bands , three sample medium bands and for the photometric reading accompanying the _ white light _",
    "astrometric measurement .",
    "each epoch measurement in any band and for any star brighter than @xmath15 ( irrespective of the spectral type ) will be accurate to better than 0.01  mag . in some bands ( like in 2b56 or 2f59 )",
    "the same limit is reached at @xmath16 . in white light ,",
    "all individual measurements of stars brighter than @xmath17 will be more accurate than 0.01 mag .",
    "field stars have colors corresponding to @xmath3g0 at @xmath18 , @xmath3k0 at @xmath19 and cooler spectral types at fainter magnitudes .",
    "therefore , optimization of spectroscopic observations has to be performed for g - k stars .",
    "low metallicity stars of the halo that covers a large fraction of the sky should be properly observed as well .",
    "wavelength region satisfying these constraints is that of the caii triplet in the far red ( cf .",
    "figure  2 ) .",
    "this spectral region is interesting even for hotter stars , because it includes the head of the paschen series and strong multiplets # 1 and 8 of ni ( for a detailed discussion see munari 1999 , 2002 ) .",
    "figure  3 illustrates the expected errors of gaia radial velocities for single field stars of g - k spectral types and for a single transit .",
    "all stars brighter than @xmath16 will have epoch radial velocities accurate to 10  km  sec@xmath5 or better , all those brighter than @xmath20 to 1  km  sec@xmath5 or better .",
    "previous reviews of sb2 eclipsing binaries as seen by gaia that nicely complement the present one have been given by zwitter ( 2002 , 2003 ) , zwitter &   munari ( 2004 ) and milone ( 2003 ) .",
    "minimal velocity separation for a firm recovery of the sb2 nature for solar type stars is of the order of 25 - 30  km  sec@xmath5 .",
    "scaling figure  3 to binary star case we see that radial velocity of each star in an sb2 binary with @xmath21 and @xmath220.5 will be derived with an error not exceeding 10  km  sec@xmath5 . with @xmath3100 spectra per star randomly distributed in phase",
    "it may be expected that 1/3 of them will contribute to precise definition of semi - amplitudes @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "if their accuracy is better than 10  km  sec@xmath5 , the resulting @xmath23 and @xmath24 will be accurate to 1  km  sec@xmath5 or better .",
    "figure  1 shows that at @xmath25 the epoch photometry in any of the 5 + 11 bands is accurate to 0.01 mag and in white light to an amazing 0.0006 mag for any of the considered stellar types .",
    "therefore _ all sb2 eclipsing binaries with @xmath26 will be accurately observed by gaia_.    it is important to check if gaia will collect enough photometric observations to properly constrain the shape of the light - curve , and of the eclipse phases in particular .",
    "the measurements in white light and broad bands are essentially simultaneous and altogether @xmath3100 observations scattered over the five year mission lifetime will be collected ( the exact number depends on the ecliptic coordinates and is generally comprised between 60 and 200 ) .",
    "gaia will also collect @xmath27 measurements in the medium bands ( again nearly simultaneous in all bands ) . moreover , rvs sky mapper measurements obtained just before spectroscopic observations will provide additional @xmath3100 photometric points in a further photometric band covering the 8480 - 8740    spectroscopic wavelength range .",
    "therefore , combining the 2b80 broad band , the 2f89 medium band and the rvs sky mappers , an average of about 370 independent photometric measurements will be obtained at wavelengths close to the cousins @xmath28 band , and 270 measurements for all other bands .",
    "such a number of photometric points should suffice for most of the cases .",
    "we have embarked in a long term project to assess the accuracy of gaia investigations of sb2 eclipsing binaries ( munari et al .",
    "2001 , zwitter et al .",
    "2003 , marrese et al .",
    "2004 , milone et al .",
    "2004 to be submitted ) .",
    "twelve systems have been studied so far , combining ground - based radial velocities acquired in the gaia wavelength range with hipparcos @xmath9 photometry ( to mimic gaia photometric mapping ) .",
    "typical light ( and radial velocity ) curves are presented in figure  5 , where orbital solutions are over - plotted .",
    "such @xmath9 mapping is generally sufficient to constrain the radii to 2 - 6% , depending of the total number of points and the width of the eclipse phases .",
    "with gaia providing 3 to 4times more points , the fraction of sb2 eclipsing binary systems for which the orbital solution will have formal errors in the 1 - 2% range should be remarkable .",
    "similar conclusions were reached by niarchos and manimanis ( 2003 ) from their investigation in a gaia - like mode of four over - contact systems .",
    "hipparcos derived a frequency of 0.8% of eclipsing binaries among the stars it surveyed . applying this to star counts in the galaxy",
    ", we may estimate that gaia will discover 64000 eclipsing binaries with @xmath26 . applying carquillat et al .",
    "( 1982 ) conclusion that 1/4 of ebs are sb2 , we end up with about 16000 sb2 eclipsing binaries brighter than @xmath25 for which gaia should provide orbital solutions formally accurate to 1 - 2% .",
    "this is a fantastic number compared to @xmath29100 systems studied at similar accuracy by ground - based observations so far .",
    "these 16000 stars will have their parallax measured to 5 micro - arcsec accuracy which corresponds to an error @xmath290.5% in their distance if closer than 1  kpc .",
    "such extremely accurate parallaxes will be sed to directly constrain the values of several parameters ( e.g.  absolute luminosity ) and physics used in orbital modeling , so that the atmospheric structure and global parameters of eclipsing binaries could be refined to _",
    "absolute _ errors well below 1% .",
    "rave ( radial velocity experiment ) is an ambitious program to conduct an all - sky survey ( complete to @xmath11=15.5 mag ) of radial velocities and metallicities of 50 million stars using the 1.2 m uk schmidt telescope of the anglo - australian observatory ( aao ) , together with a northern counterpart , over the period 2006  2010 .",
    "a key feature of the rave project is a pilot program aiming to observe @xmath30 stars using the existing 6df facility in unscheduled bright time over the period 20032005 .",
    "this pilot program begun on april 11 , 2003 and by the time this conference was held it logged the observations of 20000 stars .",
    "the 6df spectrograph brackets the caii triplet region adopted for gaia ( c. figure  2 ) .",
    "spectra are taken at a resolution of @xmath31 .",
    "the target list of the pilot program includes a large fraction of the @xmath32 hipparcos stars that are accessible from the southern hemisphere as well as some of the @xmath33 stars of the tycho-2 catalog .",
    "the survey focuses on stars in the color range @xmath34 . for these stars useful",
    "photometric parallaxes can be derived if meaningful trigonometric parallaxes are not available .",
    "the rave main survey should utilize a new echidna - style multi fiber spectrograph at the uk - schmidt telescope and its northern counterpart . in the uk - schmidt planned version it consists of a 2250-spine fiber array covering the full field of view ( 40 deg@xmath35 ) .",
    "the fiber positions are reconfigurable in @xmath36min .",
    "a detailed description of rave and in particular of its science goals , aiming to derive the kinematics and formation history of the milky way , can be found in steinmetz ( 2003 ) .",
    "rave observes any given target star only once , even if with remarkable s / n .",
    "therefore it is not possible to discover sb1 binaries or trace the motion of components in sb2 systems .",
    "however , the respectable resolution and high s / n of rave spectra allow it to detect all sb2 binaries with a suitable luminosity ratio and velocity separation at the time of the observation .",
    "given the huge number of stars surveyed by rave , this would put useful statistical constraints ( on velocity separation and luminosity ratio as a function of spectral type and metallicity ) on the population of binary stars in the milky way .",
    "figure  7 presents the results of simulations carried to out to infer the sb2 detectability by rave .",
    "they show that all f ",
    "m sb2 binaries with a luminosity ratio @xmath40.5 and observed when velocity separation of their components is @xmath435  km  sec@xmath5 will be recognized as such . and",
    "new sb2 binaries are already being discovered in the early data secured by rave in 2003 !",
