    "recent progress in reverberation mapping of active galacic nuclei ( agns ) allowed the first meaningful correlation between the broad line region ( blr ) size ( @xmath4 ) and the black hole ( bh ) mass in more than 30 objects .",
    "this provided a simple way to calculate bh masses for a large number of sources and resulted in a flood of papers on this topic . some papers ( e.g. vestergaard 2002 , hereafter v02 ; mclure and jarvis 2002 ) investigated , in great detail , the wavelength dependence of the @xmath5 relationship and provided useful ways for adopting the method to other wavelength bands .",
    "this opens the way for the study of bh masses in large samples of high luminosity high - z quasars .",
    "all the new bh mass estimates are based on a single relationship obtained for a single sample of 34 agns for which blr sizes are available from decade long reverberation mapping campaigns .",
    "more than half the sample was observed at the wise observatory over a period of about 12 years ( kaspi et al .",
    "2000 , hereafter k00 ) .",
    "other objects have been monitored in other observatories and in several `` agn watch '' campaigns ( netzer & peterson 1997 ; peterson 2001 ) .",
    "the main findings are a significant @xmath6 relationship ( @xmath7 is the monochromatic luminosity at 5100 ) and the confirmation that the blr gas is in virial motion ( e.g. peterson and wandel 2000 ) .",
    "these , plus the ( model dependent ) conversion of the observed full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of various emission lines into 3-d gas velocities , are sufficient to derive the mass of the central bh .",
    "this letter discusses the mass of the largest bh in the universe ; those found in the centers of the most luminous quasars .",
    "it follows the works of laor ( 1998 ; 2001 ) , mclure & jarvis ( 2002 ) , woo & urry ( 2002 ) and others who used such methods for obtaining bh masses beyond the original k00 sample .",
    "the paper addresses also the shields et al .",
    "( 2002 ) new results and extends the mass estimates to much larger quasar samples . section 2 presents new mass calculations for a large number of sources and  3 illustrates the new correlations found . section 4 discusses the new results in light of the available information on the largest , most luminous elliptical galaxies and the epochs of quasars and galaxy formation .",
    "new mass estimates have been obtained for a large number of agns using the @xmath8 relationship obtained from the k00 sample ; the only sample available for such calibration .",
    "this relationship is given , schematically , by @xmath9 which results in the following mass estimate : @xmath10 ^ 2 \\,\\,.\\ ] ] here @xmath11 and @xmath12 are constants that include the flux normalization and various assumptions about the velocity field in the blr .",
    "the slope @xmath13 is derived from the reverberation campaigns results and is in the range 0.5 - 0.7 ( see below ) . the expression in eqn .",
    "2 can be used to derived `` single epoch '' masses that combine the constants @xmath14 and @xmath12 with observed fwhm of certain emission lines in _ individual _ objects .",
    "the method has been described in various papers including k00 , v02 , and mclure & jarvis ( 2002 ) .",
    "its more useful applications are based on measured @xmath15(5100 ) and fwhm ( ) for low redshift sources ( the quantities used by k00 ) and the combination of @xmath15(1350 ) and fwhm ( ) for high redshift objects .",
    "v02 has looked into the inter - calibration of the two and supplied the expressions that are used in this work except for a small correction in the value of @xmath12 that was introduced to adjust her constants to the cosmology assumed here : @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "mclure & jarvis ( 2002 ) provided similar expressions for @xmath19 which are not used in this work .",
    "three agn samples have been used in this work : 1 ) the lbqs sample ( forster et al . 2000 and references therein ) , 2 ) a sample of 104 high redshift high luminosity quasars with ground - based spectrophotometry ( @xmath20 ) and good fwhm ( ) measurements , and 3 ) the new @xmath21 and fwhm ( ) listed by shields et al ( 2002 ) .",
    "many of the sources in the second sample are um quasars and the raw data can be found in macalpine and feldman 1982 , baldwin , wampler & gaskell ( 1987 ) and baldwin ( 1977 ) .",
    "forster et al . ( 2000 ) supplied monochromatic luminosities and fwhms for many emission lines in about 1000 lbqs quasars .",
    "since many of the sources have been observed through relatively small aperture , and under poor weather conditions , it was decided to use the bj magnitudes that are much more accurate .",
    "this follows green et al .",
    "( 2001 ) who studied the baldwin relationship in this sample and obtained monochromatic luminosities using the same method .",
    "all fluxes have been corrected for galactic reddening using the green et al .",
    "a major assumption here , and in green et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , is that the observed continuum can be described by a single @xmath22 power - law with @xmath23 .",
    "this approximation neglects the possible dependence of @xmath24 on source luminosity which may affect the @xmath25 relationship ( see  4 ) .",
    "forster et al . ( 2001 ) provided several different measurements of fwhm ( ) with and without the narrow line component .",
    "the `` single '' component fit was used and the `` broad only '' fit was checked to verify that the results are not sensitive to this choice .",
    "a handful of sources with fwhm()@xmath26  or with fwhm()@xmath27  were removed from the sample since those were considered unreliable or affected too much by the narrow emission line . as for the second  sample ,",
    "no galactic reddening was applied and the same assumption about @xmath28 was used . in this case there is no significant dependence on @xmath24 since the original papers quote the observed flux at around rest wavelength of 1450 .",
    "the above samples are optically selected and suffer from various selection effects .",
    "this is of no real consequence to the main goal of the paper which is to derive the mass of the largest known bhs .",
    "it may affect , however , the derived @xmath29 correlations (  4 ) .",
    "bh masses have been calculated using equation 2 and the normalizations derived by k00 and v02 adjusted to the cosmology chosen here .",
    "the determination of the slope @xmath14 is crucial for the present work and will be discussed prior to presentation of the new results .",
    "we start from the original k00 sample to which we apply two statistical methods for finding @xmath14 : the akritas & bershady ( 1996 ) bces estimator ( for which we only consider the bces bisector ) and the _ fitexy _ method described in press et al .",
    "the merits of the different methods have been discussed , extensively , in several papers and will not be repeated here .",
    "our experience shows that that the differences between the slopes obtained by the different methods are larger than the formal uncertainties on the slopes of each method .",
    "the k00 sample adjusted to the new cosmology gives @xmath30 for the bces bisector estimator and @xmath31 for the _ fitexy _ method .",
    "the two are formally consistent with each other and @xmath32 was adopted here .",
    "since the purpose of this work is to extrapolate to very large @xmath33 , we also experimented with removing the lowest luminosity objects from the sample . removing the three objects with @xmath34 resulted in @xmath35 and @xmath36 . removing",
    "the seven objects with @xmath37  resulted in @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "all these results suggest that the two methods are consistent with each other and the slope can not be determined to an accuracy better than about 0.15 .",
    "the value adopted for illustrating the results of this work is the smaller one found for the entire k00 , @xmath40 .",
    "the implications for the case of larger or smaller @xmath14 are discussed in  4 .",
    "shields et al .",
    "( 2002 ) suggested the use of the `` physically motivated '' value of @xmath41 .",
    "the strongest argument for using this value is the suggestion by netzer & laor ( 1993 ) that the outer boundary of the blr is determined by the dust sublimation radius which is similar to the measure @xmath4 to within a factor @xmath42 .",
    "there are several problems in applying this idea to the present mass determination .",
    "first , the `` reverberation radius '' is determined by the responsivity of  to changes in the ionizing luminosity , @xmath43 , which is smaller than the bolometric luminosity that determines the dust sublimation radius .",
    "in addition , @xmath41 means the same blr ionization parameter for low luminosity seyferts and the highest luminosity quasars .",
    "this has never been shown to be the case in large qso samples .",
    "thus , more work is required to justify this theoretical value of @xmath14 .",
    "the masses computed with the @xmath40 slope are presented in fig .",
    "1 . the diagram contains data for 505 qsos with measurements and 219 source with  measuremets .",
    "the luminosity range is roughly @xmath44 .",
    "also shown is the best regression line ( see below ) and the mass range of @xmath45 around the median calculated in luminosity bins of 0.3 dex .",
    "the largest bhs are found in sources with @xmath46 with @xmath47  ( 15 with mass exceeding @xmath0 ) . using @xmath48 ( the slope found with the @xmath49 method ) , raise this number to about @xmath50  ( 62 with mass exceeding @xmath0 ) .",
    "2 shows @xmath51 as a function of redshift for the same sample under the same assumptions .        the data in fig .",
    "1 suggest a simple linear dependence of the form @xmath52 .",
    "this has been tested by performing a linear regression analysis using the same two methods described earlier .",
    "the procedure used for calculating the errors is the following : for @xmath53 , the assumption is of a constant error of 0.15 dex representing the measurement uncertainty , the extrapolation in wavelength and the typical range in luminosity due to continuum variability .",
    "this number does not affect the resulting slope @xmath54 in any significant way .",
    "as for the mass , this was done using standard error propagation combining all errors due to the uncertainties in @xmath33 and in fwhm ( line width uncertainties are given in forster et al .",
    "the combined error for this case is typically 0.15 - 0.25 dex .",
    "no uncertainties are listed for fwhm ( ) in the second quasar sample and for fwhm ( ) in shields et al .",
    "a uniform error of 0.2 dex in @xmath51 was assumed in those cases .",
    "the errors are relatively large and are expressed in logarithmic form ( i.e. 0.5(log(x+dx)@xmath55log(x@xmath55dx ) , see lyons , 1991 ) .",
    "table 1 lists several slopes obtained by the two methods for our standard case of @xmath40 and for @xmath48 , the slope obtained by the @xmath49 method .",
    "given the various biases and unknowns , it is reasonable to assume that the real uncertainty in @xmath54 is at least as large as @xmath56 . with this uncertainty ,",
    "the slopes of the  sample and the entire sample are barely consistent with each other and the slopes of the  sample and the entire sample are indistinguishable .",
    "the scatter in slope is probably due to the very different luminosity range of the  and the  samples .",
    "a second approach that was tries assumed a uniform uncertainty in @xmath51 of 0.3 dex for all objects .",
    "this gave very similar results .",
    "the overall conclusion is that for luminous agns , @xmath57 .",
    "lcccc bces bisector & 0.58 & all  & 1.12@xmath58 & -42.9 + @xmath49 & 0.58 & all  & 1.13@xmath59 & -43.1 + bces bisector & 0.58 & all  & 0.83@xmath60 & -29.2 + @xmath49 & 0.58 & all   & 0.80@xmath61 & -27.6 + bces bisector & 0.58 & all objects & 0.80@xmath61 & -27.7 + @xmath49 & 0.58 & all objects & 0.78@xmath62 & -26.9 + bces bisector & 0.68 & all objects & 0.90@xmath61 & -32.2 + @xmath49 & 0.68 & all objects & 0.89@xmath62 & -31.9 +    the @xmath63 correlation found here is very different from the one found in k00 .",
    "the reason is probably the incompleteness of the small k00 sample which resulted in a biased sampling of fwhm ( ) vs. @xmath64 not representing the parent population .",
    "indeed , k00 found fwhm()@xmath65 while in the samples under study the correlation is much flatter .",
    "luminosity dependence in various samples will be addressed in a separate paper ( corbett et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the tight @xmath63 relationship enables the study of the eddington ratio , @xmath66 , in these samples .",
    "the observed @xmath29 relationship suggests a very weak , if any dependence of @xmath66 on @xmath33 or on @xmath51 .",
    "this impression is confirmed by a formal statistical analysis . since the results are marginal , they will not be presented here .",
    "another important issue is the mean @xmath66 .",
    "this depends on the distribution in this property as well as on the exact conversion from @xmath15 to bolometric luminosity and the value of @xmath14 . assuming first @xmath40 and @xmath67 , as in k00 , gives a median @xmath66 of 0.53 .",
    "the composite spectra published recently by telfer et al .",
    "( 2002 ) suggest a different conversion with @xmath68 .",
    "this translates to a median of 0.28 .",
    "the above values are transformed to 0.33 and 0.18 for the case of @xmath48 . in both cases",
    "the distribution wis wide , covering about a factor 10 in @xmath69 .",
    "thus , the choice of @xmath40 results in a large mean @xmath66 and a large number of sources with super eddington luminosities . as explained by woo and urry ( 2002 ) , the implications to the derived @xmath63 relation",
    "are very importance ( see  4 ) .",
    "the new results presented here suggest that the largest bhs are situated in the most luminous quasars that are , typically , the highest redshift sources . at the extreme end of the distribution we find bh masses of order @xmath70  if @xmath71 , and @xmath72  if @xmath41 . this is greater than obtained so far in large samples .",
    "the recent work by shields et al .",
    "( 2002 ) aimed at the calibration of the the  line width as a bulge mass estimator .",
    "the method is based on the close agreement between fwhm ( ) and the stellar velocity dispersion @xmath73 at low luminosity and the k00 mass estimates at higher luminosity . using this method and @xmath41 ( their table 2 ) they find one object with @xmath51 exceeding @xmath0  and several others approaching this mass . as shown in fig .",
    "1 , the samples includes many more sources with such large masses .      1 .",
    "the k00 sample covers a limited luminosity range and all mass estimates corresponding to @xmath74 are necessarily obtained by extrapolation . since this is _ the only _ sample available so far , there is no independent way to verify the largest masses until successful reverberation mappings are obtained for higher luminosity agn .",
    "moreover , as explained in  2 , the slope of the @xmath4-@xmath33 relationship is uncertain .",
    "the slope chosen here ( @xmath40 ) is close to the middle of the range .",
    "its increase to 0.7 will increase the mass at the high luminosity end by a factor of about 2.5 . 2 .",
    "the largest new mass estimates are based on the measured @xmath75 which is scaled to the k00 luminosity assuming the same spectral energy distribution ( sed ) for high and low luminosity agns .",
    "this assumption has never been tested in large quasar samples .",
    "the data for such test are already available ( telfer et al . 2002 ) but the results are not yet known .",
    "intrinsic reddening , in the quasar host galaxy , is another potential complication related to the inter - calibration of optical and uv luminosities .",
    "3 .   the fwhm ( ) may not reflect the virial motion of the blr gas in high luminosity quasars .",
    "the samples used here suffer from various selection effects .",
    "this influence only slightly the largest derived masses but can affect much more the @xmath76 correlation .",
    "for example , magnitude limited samples may not include the less luminous quasars , those with the smallest @xmath66 .",
    "this results in a false impression of a very strong @xmath29 correlation .",
    "woo and urry ( 2002 ) investigated this idea in great detail and concluded that all strong @xmath29 correlations obtained so far suffer from such a selection effect .",
    "the main conclusion of this work is that the largest bh masses are found in the highest luminosity quasars .",
    "the masses of such bhs can reach the extreme values of @xmath77 , depending on the value of @xmath14 .",
    "using recent conversions to host galaxy properties one finds @xmath78  ( kormendy & gebhardt 2001 ) , @xmath79 mag ( kormendy 2001 ) and @xmath73 exceeding 800 km / sec ( tremaine et al . 2002 ) .",
    "such galaxies have never been observed and are not predicted to exist by standard galaxy formation theories .    in principle , this is still consistent with the observations since the sources with the largest @xmath51 are the most luminous ones and will completely out - shine any host galaxy .",
    "thus , there is no direct way to rule out the existence of such galaxies .",
    "however , the theoretical implication are in conflict with recent ideas that the largest galaxies attain their mass through a series of mergers , a process that operates continuously to redshift 2 or smaller .",
    "a similar difficulty is found for the bh growth since those same theories ( e.g. haehnelt and kauffman 2000 ; yu and tremaine 2002 ) assume that galactic nuclei bhs increase their mass up to redshifts smaller than 2 by the same series of mergers ( or , perhaps , only through large mergers ) .",
    "thus , the largest bhs are predicted to be associated with the most massive galaxies at @xmath80 , in conflict with the data in fig .",
    "it is clear that active bh with @xmath81   are not found in the local universe .",
    "it is also clear that dormant bhs of this mass , or the galaxies with extreme properties that are supposed to host such bhs , have never been found .",
    "the whereabout of the huge bh formed at @xmath82 is thus unknown .",
    "a more plausible suggestion is that some or all the conversion factors used to obtain the galactic mass , magnitude and @xmath73 from the bh mass , that are based on measurements in the local universe , can not be extrapolated to high luminosity high redshift objects .",
    "perhaps they are only valid at @xmath80 , after galaxies and nuclear bhs have accumulated most of their mass .",
    "if correct , this would mean that some `` normal looking '' galaxies contain extremely massive bhs .",
    "a similar suggestion by laor ( 2001 ) involves a dependence of @xmath83 on the bh mass or the absolute magnitude of the host galaxy .    to conclude ,",
    "either the measurements of bh masses presented here for the most luminous quasars are grossly overestimated , because of the reasons described above , or else the relationships between bh masses and various properties of their host galaxies at high @xmath84 are very different from those measured in the local universe .",
    "a second conclusion , which is less certain because of various selection effects , is that for agns , @xmath57 .",
    "the work described in this paper is based primarily on a decade - long agn monitoring project at the wise observatory .",
    "i am grateful to many of my colleagues and students that helped in making this into a very successful project .",
    "special thanks go to dan maoz , shai kaspi and ohad shemmer who led various parts of the project and without whom it would have been impossible to bring it to completion .",
    "useful discussions with ari laor are gratefully acknowledged .",
