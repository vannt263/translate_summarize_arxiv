    "the three - dimensional models of gravity have attracted a remarkable interest in recent years . apart from the btz black hole banados:1992wn , which is a solution to the einstein equations with a negative cosmological constant , much attention has been paid to topologically massive gravity ( tmg ) , which generalizes three - dimensional general relativity ( gr ) by adding a chern - simons gravitational term to the einstein - hilbert action @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the propagating degree of freedom is a massive graviton .",
    "tmg also admits the btz and other black holes as exact solutions .",
    "the renewed interest in tmg results from the possibility of constructing a chiral theory of gravity at a special point of the space of parameters , @xcite .",
    "another three - dimensional massive gravity theory that has attracted attention in recent years is known as new massive gravity ( nmg ) , where the action is the standard einstein - hilbert term plus a specific combination of scalar curvature square term and a ricci tensor square term bergshoeff:2009hq , bergshoeff:2009 tb , andringa:2009yc , and at the linearized level it is equivalent to the fierz - pauli action for a massive spin-2 field bergshoeff:2009hq .",
    "nmg admits interesting solutions , see for instance @xcite ; for further aspects of nmg see @xcite .",
    "tmg and nmg share common features , however there are different aspects : one of these is the existence in nmg of black holes known as new type black holes , which are also solutions of conformal gravity in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "lifshitz spacetimes have received considerable attention from the point of view of condensed matter , i.e. the search for gravity duals of lifshitz fixed points due to the ads / cft correspondence @xcite for condensed matter physics and quantum chromodynamics @xcite .",
    "there are many invariant scale theories of interest when studying such critical points , such theories exhibit the anisotropic scale invariance @xmath1 , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the relative scale dimension of time and space , and they are of particular interest in studies of critical exponent theory and phase transitions .",
    "lifshitz spacetimes are described by the metrics @xmath4 where @xmath5 represents a @xmath6 dimensional spatial vector , with @xmath7 representing the spacetime dimension while @xmath8 denotes the length scale in the geometry . for @xmath9",
    "this spacetime is the usual anti - de sitter metric in poincar coordinates .",
    "the metrics of the lifshitz black holes asymptotically have the form ( [ lif1 ] ) .",
    "several lifshitz black holes have been reported ayonbeato:2009nh , cai:2009ac , ayonbeato:2010tm , dehghani:2010kd , mann:2009yx , balasubramanian:2009rx , bertoldi:2009vn , bravo - gaete:2013dca , correa:2014ika , alvarez:2014pra .    in this work",
    ", we will consider a matter distribution outside the horizon of a lifshitz black hole in three - dimensional conformal gravity with @xmath0 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that for @xmath0 the anisotropic scale invariance corresponds to space - like scale invariance with no transformation of time .",
    "the matter is parameterized by a scalar field , which we will perturb by assuming that there is no back reaction on the metric .",
    "we then obtain the reflection and transmission coefficients , the absorption cross section and the quasinormal frequencies ( qnfs ) for scalar fields , and study their stability under scalar perturbations .",
    "conformal gravity is a four - derivative theory and it is perturbatively renormalizable @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it contains ghostlike modes , in the form of massive spin-2 excitations .",
    "however , it has been shown that by using the method of dirac constraints dirac to quantize a prototype second plus fourth order theory , viz .",
    "the pais - uhlenbeck fourth order oscillator model @xcite , it becomes apparent that the limit in which the second order piece is switched off is a highly singular one in which the would - be ghost states move off the mass shell @xcite . in three spacetime dimensions",
    "the equations of motion contain third derivatives of the metric .",
    "ads and lifshitz black holes with @xmath0 and @xmath10 in four - dimensional conformal gravity have been studied in @xcite , and solutions to conformal gravity in three dimensions have been studied in @xcite .",
    "several studies have contributed to the scattering and absorption properties of waves in the spacetime of black holes .",
    "as the geometry of the spacetime surrounding a black hole is non - trivial , the hawking radiation emitted at the event horizon may be modified by this geometry , so that when an observer located very far away from the black hole measures the spectrum , this will no longer be that of a black body @xcite .",
    "the factors that modify the spectrum emitted by a black hole are known as greybody factors and can be obtained through classical scattering ; their study therefore allows the semiclassical gravity dictionary to be increased , and also offers insight into the quantum nature of black holes and thus of quantum gravity ; for an excellent review of this topic see @xcite .",
    "also , see for instance @xcite , for decay of dirac fields in higher dimensional black holes .",
    "on the other hand , the study of the qnfs gives information about the stability of black holes under matter fields that evolve perturbatively in their exterior region , without backreacting on the metric @xcite .",
    "furthermore , according to the ads / cft correspondence the qnfs determine how fast a thermal state in the boundary theory will reach thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "also , in @xcite the authors discuss a connection between hawking radiation and quasinormal modes ( qnms ) , which can naturally be interpreted in terms of quantum levels . in three dimensions ,",
    "the qnms of btz black holes have been studied in @xcite ; scalar and fermionic qnms in the background of new type black holes in nmg were studied in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "studies of qnms in lifshitz black holes can be found in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the absoption cross section for lifshitz black holes were examined in moon:2012dy , gonzalez:2012xc , lepe:2012zf , and particle motion in these geometries in @xcite .",
    "fermions on lifshitz background have been studied in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we find a lifshitz black hole with @xmath0 in three - dimensional conformal gravity . in sec .",
    "iii we calculate the reflection and transmission coefficients , the absorption cross section and the quasinormal modes of scalar perturbations for the three - dimensional lifshitz black hole with @xmath0 .",
    "we conclude with final remarks in sec .",
    "in this work we will consider a matter distribution described by a scalar field outside the event horizon of an asymptotically lifshitz black hole in three - dimensional conformal gravity with @xmath0 . in three dimensions ,",
    "the field equations of conformal gravity are given by the vanishing of the cotton tensor : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the ricci scalar .",
    "the cotton tensor is a traceless tensor that vanishes if and only if the metric is locally conformally flat .",
    "solutions to this theory have been studied in @xcite .    in order to find a lifshitz black hole solution in three - dimensional conformal gravity , we consider the following ansatz for the metric    @xmath13    and from the field equations ( [ fieldeq ] ) we obtain    @xmath14    for @xmath15 ( lifshitz spacetime ) , the above equation yields the solutions @xmath0 and @xmath9 . however",
    ", as we mentioned , @xmath9 corresponds to the usual anti - de sitter metric in poincar coordinates .",
    "now , doing @xmath0 in the field equation ( [ differential ] ) , the following lifshitz black hole solution is found    @xmath16    the requirement @xmath17 implies that @xmath18 .",
    "the kretschmann scalar is given by @xmath19therefore , there is a curvature singularity at @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "other asymptotically lifshitz black hole solutions in four - dimensional and six - dimensional conformal gravity are found in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "metric ( [ solution ] ) is conformally related to an asymptotically de sitter black hole .",
    "this can be seen by defining @xmath22 , where the conformal factor is given by    @xmath23    and @xmath24 is a constant .",
    "the new radial coordinate @xmath25 is defined by @xmath26 , and    @xmath27    where    @xmath28",
    "this metric corresponds to an asymptotically de sitter black hole .",
    "metrics of the form ( [ conf ] ) were studied in @xcite .",
    "notice that the conformal factor is not singular on the horizon .",
    "however , it is singular at the asymptotic region @xmath29 , therefore , the asymptotic regions of the two conformally related metrics are very different .    in the next section",
    ", we will determine the reflection coefficient , the transmission coefficient and the absorption cross section of the lifshitz black hole metric ( [ solution ] ) found in this section .",
    "then , we will compute the qnfs , which coincide with the poles of the transmission coefficient and we will study the linear stability of these black holes under scalar field perturbations .",
    "the scalar perturbations in the background of an asymptotically lifshitz black hole in three - dimensional conformal gravity with dynamical exponent @xmath0 are given by the klein - gordon equation of the scalar field solution with suitable boundary conditions at the event horizon and at the asymptotic infinity .",
    "in section @xmath30 we will consider a scalar field minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "then , in section @xmath31 , we will study a scalar field non - minimally coupled .",
    "the klein - gordon equation in curved spacetime is given by @xmath32where @xmath33 is the mass of the scalar field @xmath34 , which is minimally coupled to curvature . by means of the following ansatz @xmath35the klein - gordon equation reduces to the following differential equation for the radial function @xmath36 @xmath37now , by considering @xmath38 and by introducing the tortoise coordinate @xmath39 , given by @xmath40 , the latter equation can be rewritten as a one - dimensional schrdinger equation @xmath41 g(x)=0~,\\]]where the effective potential is given by @xmath42 in fig .",
    "( [ potencial ] ) we plot the effective potential for @xmath43 , @xmath44 and different values of the angular momentum @xmath45 .",

    "@xmath61 is a hypergeometric function and @xmath62 and @xmath63 are integration constants .",
    "thus , the solution for the radial function @xmath64 is @xmath65so , in the vicinity of the horizon , @xmath0 and using the property @xmath66 , the function @xmath64 behaves as @xmath67and the scalar field @xmath34 , for @xmath68 , can be written as follows @xmath69where the first term represents an ingoing wave and the second one an outgoing wave in the black hole .",
    "so , by imposing that only ingoing waves exist at the horizon , this fixes @xmath70 .",
    "the radial solution then becomes @xmath71    the reflection and transmission coefficients depend on the behavior of the radial function , both at the horizon and at the asymptotic infinity , and they are defined by @xmath72where @xmath73 is the flux , and is given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 .",
    "the behavior at the horizon is given by  ( [ rhorizon ] ) , and using  ( [ flux1 ] ) , we get the flux at the horizon @xmath76now , in order to obtain the asymptotic behavior of @xmath77 , we take the limit @xmath78 in ( [ equationc1 ] ) . thus , we obtain the following solution    @xmath79    thus , the flux  ( [ flux1 ] ) at the asymptotic region is given by @xmath80where @xmath81 .",
    "on the other hand , by replacing kummer s formula @xcite , in ( [ horizonsolution ] ) , @xmath82and by using eq .",
    "( [ flux1 ] ) we obtain the flux @xmath83where , @xmath84therefore , the reflection and transmission coefficients are given by @xmath85@xmath86and the absorption cross section @xmath87 , becomes @xmath88 now , we will study the behavior of the reflection and transmission coefficients and the absorption cross section at the low and high frecuency limits .    at the low frequency limit , @xmath89",
    ", the coefficients @xmath90 and @xmath91 are given aproximately by    @xmath92    using the expressions above , the following low frequency limit is obtained for the reflection coefficient    @xmath93    where , in the last equality we used the fact that @xmath94 . for the transmission coefficient and the absorption cross section ,",
    "we find    @xmath95    where we have used the properties @xmath96 , @xmath94 and @xmath97 .    at the high frequency limit @xmath98 ,",
    "the coefficients @xmath90 and @xmath91 are given by    @xmath99    we will consider the case @xmath100 . the case @xmath101 is similar and the same asymptotic behavior is obtained .    using the asymptotic expansion of the @xmath102 functions for @xmath103 @xcite ,    @xmath104~,\\ ] ]    we obtain    @xmath105    therefore , at high frequencies    @xmath106    now , we will carry out a numerical analysis of the reflection coefficient  ( [ coef12 ] ) , transmission coefficient  ( [ coef22 ] ) , and absorption cross section  ( [ absorptioncrosssection2 ] ) of @xmath0 lifshitz black holes , for scalar fields .",
    "so , we plot the reflection and transmission coefficients and the absorption cross section in fig .",
    "( [ figura1 ] ) , with @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath107 .",
    "we can see , as expected from the above asymptotic analysis , that the reflection coefficient is one at the low frequency limit , and at the high frequency limit this coefficient is null .",
    "the behavior of the transmission coefficient is the opposite , with @xmath108 . also , the absorption cross section is null at the low and high - frequency limits , but there is a range of frequencies for which the absorption cross section is not null , and it also has a maximum value .",

    "these poles are given by @xmath119 , and this occurs when @xmath120 or @xmath121 , with @xmath122 ... .",
    "therefore , the quasinormal frequencies are given by @xmath123    we observe that for @xmath124 the qnfs are purely imaginary and for @xmath125 they acquire a real part .",
    "also , we observe that for some values of the scalar field mass @xmath33 the quasinormal frequencies can have a positive imaginary part , therefore we conclude that this black hole is not stable under scalar field perturbations minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "in this section we consider a scalar field non - minimally coupled to curvature , propagating in the background of the lifshitz black hole ( [ solution ] ) . in particular , we study the case of a scalar field conformally coupled .",
    "the klein - gordon equation is given by    @xmath126    where @xmath127 is the non - mininal coupling parameter , and @xmath128 is the ricci scalar .    in this case , by means of the ansatz @xmath129 , we obtain the following radial equation    @xmath130    we can see that , due to the simplicity of the ricci scalar in this background , it is possible to obtain this equation directly from ( [ first ] ) by means of the following transformations @xmath131    therefore , the reflection and transmission coefficients , the absorption cross section and the quasinormal modes for the non - minimal case can be obtained easily from the equations ( [ coef12 ] ) , ( [ coef22 ] ) and ( [ absorptioncrosssection2 ] ) of the minimal case by using transformations ( [ cambio ] ) .    for a conformally coupled scalar field , @xmath132 and @xmath133 , one can find that the qualitative behavior of the reflection and transmission coefficients and the absortion cross section is similar to the obtained in section @xmath30 for a minimally coupled scalar field , and for the quasinormal frequencies we obtain the following expression    @xmath134    which have a negative imaginary part , therefore , the black hole is stable under conformally coupled scalar field perturbations .    also , we note that the effective potential goes to zero at the asymptotic infinity .",
    "in this work we studied scalar field perturbations of an asymptotically lifshitz black hole in three - dimensional conformal gravity with dynamical exponent @xmath0 , where in this case the anisotropic scale invariance corresponds to a space - like scale invariance with no transformation of time , and we calculated the reflection and transmission coefficients , the absorption cross section and the quasinormal modes .",
    "the results obtained show that the absorption cross section vanishes at the low frequency limit as well as at the high frequency limit .",
    "this means that a wave emitted from the horizon , with low or high frequency , does not reach spatial infinity and therefore is totally reflected , because the fraction of particles penetrating the potential barrier vanishes .",
    "we have also shown in fig .",
    "( [ figura1 ] ) that there is a range of frequencies where the absorption cross section is not null . on the other hand ,",
    "the reflection coefficient is one at the low frequency limit and null at high frequencies ; the behavior of the transmission coefficient is the opposite , where @xmath108 .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that the absorption cross section decreases for higher values of angular momentum , and decreases when the mass @xmath33 of the scalar field increases ; however , for high frequencies the difference is negligible , see figs .",
    "( [ figura2 ] , [ figura3 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we calculated analytically the qnfs of scalar perturbations , which coincide with the poles of the transmission coefficient , and we found two sets of quasinormal frequencies .",
    "however , some of these can have a positive imaginary part , depending of the value of @xmath33 , and therefore the black hole is not stable under scalar field perturbations for a scalar field minimally coupled to curvature .",
    "if the scalar field is conformally coupled to the curvature , we found that the imaginary part of the quasinormal frequencies is negative , which guarantees the linear stability of the black hole in this case .",
    "interesting aplications we hope to address in the near future are the holographic implications of the results of this paper .",
