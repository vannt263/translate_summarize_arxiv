    "little has changed in our understanding of star formation in cooling flows since the the topic was last reviewed at the meeting on cooling flows at haifa in 1996 .",
    "however , the nature of the so - called `` cooling flow problem '' has changed dramatically since then .",
    "this controversial problem concerns the deficit between the large cooling rates of the kev gas in the centers of clusters and the much smaller star formation rates observed in central cluster galaxies located at the bases of cooling flows ( fabian 1994 ) .",
    "while the cooling rates based on _ einstein _ and _ rosat _ x - ray observations ( but not asca , see makishima this conference ) were claimed to be tens to hundreds of solar masses per year , the star formation rates are generally between a few to several tens of solar masses per year . in spite of recent detections of molecular gas in cooling flows ( edge 2001 )",
    ", this apparent violation of mass continuity can not be reconciled by a repository of molecular gas clouds or star formation with the local initial mass function in central cluster galaxies .",
    "adherents of the cooling flow paradigm dodged the problem by appealing to a repository of elusive matter , such as low mass stars or a mist of cold clouds .",
    "others proposed heating mechanisms ( e.g. , active nuclei , or agn , heat conduction , cosmic rays , mergers , magnetic reconnection , etc . ) with the potential to inject enough energy into the kev gas to balance radiative losses .",
    "nevertheless , these proposals generally suffered various problems , such as the need for fine tuning , but mostly they lacked observational support .",
    "two recent developments have dramatically changed our view of cooling flows .",
    "first , xmm-_newton _ grating spectra of the critical soft x - ray band failed to detect the emission lines that dominate cooling below 2 kev at the predicted levels ( peterson et al .",
    "2003 , & this conference ) .",
    "although the spectra do not exclude cooling entirely , they limit the amount of gas cooling below x - ray temperatures ( where it is available to fuel star formation ) to be @xmath0 times less than the predicted levels .",
    "the spectra imply that most of the cooling gas is maintained above @xmath1 kev ( i.e. , it is being reheated ) , or that it is cooling without an obvious spectroscopic signature ( fabian et al 2000b , peterson et al .",
    "similar conclusions have been reached using moderate resolution ccd spectroscopy from _ chandra _ and xmm-_newton _",

    "these interactions are creating x - ray surface brightness depressions or cavities that , like bubbles in soda water , move buoyantly through the intracluster medium .",
    "the bubbles in some ( but not all ) systems , contain enough energy to balance radiative losses emerging from the centers of clusters in the x - ray band .",
    "this , along with the discovery of very short central cooling timescales , and at the same time , the lack of evidence for strong cooling below x - ray temperatures , have renewed interest in feedback - driven heating mechanisms capable of balancing radiation losses ( nulsen , this conference ) .",
    "it is now an established fact that the kev gas in clusters with cooling times approaching 100 myr are frequently associated with the sites of star formation .",
    "therefore , this star formation may have been fueled during the cooling phase of the feed - back loop .",
    "i list below a few of the key observational facts about star formation in cooling flows .",

    ", spatially extended nebular emission is seen preferentially in clusters ( e.g. perseus ) with central cooling times below @xmath3 gyr ( hu 1988 ; heckman et al .",
    "recent comparisons between optical emission line maps and _ chandra _ x - ray maps have shown spatial correlations between nebular emission and bright lumps and filaments of gas ( figure 1 ) where the radiative cooling time approaches @xmath4 yr ( fabian et al . 2003 , blanton et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the star formation histories vary between short duration bursts @xmath5 myr of age , or more extended episodes lasting between 0.1 - 1 gyr ; such histories are inconsistent with steady cooling and accretion that has endured for the ages of clusters ( allen 1995 , crawford et al 1999 , mcnamara 1997 , mcnamara et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the short duration bursts are , in some cases , triggered by the central radio source ( mcnamara & oconnell 1993 ) .",
    "a clean demonstration of equality between the level of cooling and star formation plus its associated gas would be a critical test of the new , self - regulated cooling paradigm .",
    "more importantly , if it can be shown that the cooling upper limits are systematically below the star formation levels , a possibility that is now within reach , we would be in a position to reject the link between cooling and star formation , with some measure of confidence .",
    "cooling rates have now been estimated for several clusters with _",
    "chandra _ and xmm-_newton_. as i discussed above , they are systematically below the classical values .",
    "this trend is shown in figure 2 , where i plot cooling rate ( @xmath6 ) versus star formation rate ( sfr ) , in solar masses per year , for five clusters .",
    "the solid squares show the morphological cooling rates from the _ rosat / einstein _ era , calculated essentially by dividing the central gas mass by the cooling time .",
    "the modern cooling rates fall well below these values and are shown along with their measurement uncertainties . only abell 1795 and abell 2597 have independent cooling measurements from _ fuse _ spectra of the o vi @xmath7 feature ( oegerle et al .",
    "2001 ) . in both cases ,",
    "the ultraviolet cooling rates , shown as filled dots in figure 2 , lie within the uncertainties of the x - ray cooling rates , represented as vertical bars .",
    "the cooling rates for the remaining objects are presented as upper limits because the _ chandra_-acis spectral cooling rates represent the `` maximum cooling '' models consistent with the data ( wise et al .",
    "2004 ) , and they should not be misconstrued as the unique spectral signatures of cooling below one or two kev . in other words , in spite of the very short cooling time of the kev gas , single temperature model plasmas provided acceptable fits to the data at each radius .",
    "the star formation rates owe their uncertainties ( horizontal bars ) primarily to the difficult problem of measuring the intrinsic colors of young accretion populations against the background glare of the cd galaxy , mismeasuring extinction , and degeneracies in the population models themselves ( cf . , mcnamara et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows that the cooling and star formation rates are generally converging , and in some cases they agree to within the ( substantial ) measurement errors .",
    "this is evident in abell 1068 , abell 2597 , and abell 1795 .",
    "while i do nt regard this as proof positive that the cooling flow problem has been solved , we are clearly on the right track . the challenges ahead include improving our understanding of the star formation rates and histories , and obtaining higher precision ( deeper ) x - ray spectra capable of turning the current upper limits into cooling detections , or excluding cooling entirely at levels below the the star formation rates .",
    "essentially all indicators are telling us that the enormous radiation losses in cluster cores are balanced , or nearly so , by some form of heating .",
    "clear - cut evidence now exists that interactions between radio sources and the surrounding gas are supplying some of this heat in many clusters and perhaps all of it in others ( see nulsen and blanton this conference ) .",
    "cavities have been identified in nearly two dozen clusters over the past three years ( brzan et al .",
    "the archetypes , hydra a ( mcnamara et al . 2000 ) and perseus ( bhringer et al . 1993 , fabian et al . 2000 ) , are typical of most systems : twin surface brightness depressions @xmath8 kpc in diameter lying at distances of @xmath9 kpc from the nucleus of the cd .",
    "cavities have also been observed in giant elliptical galaxies , such as m84 ( finoguenov & jones 2001 ) , and groups , such as hgg 62 ( brzan et al .",
    "cavity ages range between @xmath10 .",
    "their enthalpy ranges between @xmath11 in isolated galaxies and groups to @xmath12 in rich clusters .",
    "the total energy input from each agn outburst may be several times these figures when shocks are included ( fabian 2003 , forman et al .",
    "the total energy deposited into the intracluster medium integrated over the lifetime of the agn can greatly exceed @xmath13 erg ( mcnamara et al .",
    "2001 , and see nulsen et al .",
    "2003 for a review ) .",
    "nevertheless , while agn may be able to retard or quench cooling in many systems , they would do so with great difficulty in others .",
    "only @xmath14 of clusters in the _ chandra _ archive have obvious cavity systems , and many of these systems contain too little energy to balance radiative losses at the current time ( brzan et al 2004 ) .    other heating agents could be assisting the agn at balancing radiative losses . of these",
    ", heat conduction between the cool cores and hot outer layers of clusters has received a good deal of attention ( voigt et al .",
    "2002 ) . but",
    "this model has problems . in order to work effectively",
    ", most studies have concluded that conduction must be suppressed by several times the spitzer rate .",
    "while this may be true in special cases , it can not be easily demonstrated observationally . in other systems ,",
    "heat conduction acting alone at the spitzer rate is incapable of balancing radiative losses ( voigt et al .",
    "2002 , zakamska & narayan 2003 , wise et al .",
    "additional agents acting together to a greater or lesser degree , such as mergers ( motl et al .",
    "2003 ) and supernovae associated with star formation ( mcnamara et al .",
    "2004 ) , must be assisting the agn .",
    "i have shown that the star formation rates estimated with optical , ultraviolet , and infrared observations are within factors of several of the new cooling limits , and in some cases , agree to within their errors . what we know about the star formation histories in cooling flows points to repeated bursts of star formation lasting @xmath15 yr .",
    "in some cases , the starbursts are triggered by the central radio sources .",
    "constant star formation over the ages of clusters , the history of star formation predicted by steady cooling flow models , is inconsistent with most data .",
    "the overall picture of star formation in cooling flows is consistent with , and indeed has helped to shape , the emerging paradigm of self - regulated cooling in clusters . the x - ray , optical , and radio data taken together point to episodes of cooling and periodic reheating by radio outbursts and their associated bubbles .",
    "this scenario ( e.g. , churazov et al . 2002 ) has received observational support from the newly - discovered trend between central x - ray luminosity and the instantaneous kinetic luminosity of bubbles in clusters ( brzan et al .",
    "thermal conduction may be an additional element of the feed - back loop that regulates cooling ( ruszkowski & begelman 2002 , nulsen 2003 ) .",
    "this emerging picture of cooling flows has broad implications for theories of structure formation and evolution .",
    "feed - back processes may have been important during the early development of galactic bulges and their central black holes , and they may regulate the thermal balance of the hot gas in giant elliptical galaxies today ( nulsen , this conference ) . the possibility that such processes are active in large , bright , relatively nearby clusters provides a unique opportunity to test these models in detail .",
