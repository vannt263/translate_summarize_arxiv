    "a quarter - century ago , a quantum phase transition from a superfluid ( sf ) to bose glass ( bg ) , a many - body bosonic counterpart of anderson localization , was predicted theoretically , first in one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems by giamarchi and schulz ( gs ) @xcite , and later in any dimension by fisher",
    "_ @xcite . over the years",
    ", substantial progress has been achieved in understanding this fascinating physics such as describing the interplay between disorder and commensurability @xcite , including the transition to the so - called mott glass ( mg ) phase ( rather than bg ) in disordered commensurate systems featuring particle - hole symmetry @xcite , and the theorem of inclusions , which rules out a direct superfluid  to  mott - insulator transition and establishes the griffiths universality class for transitions out of a fully gapped state @xcite .",
    "accurate groundstate phase diagrams of the disordered bosonic hubbard model in dimensions @xmath0 and partly @xmath1 have been produced by first - principles monte carlo simulations @xcite , which were also used for large - scale simulations of the universal critical behavior @xcite .",
    "nowadays , rapid experimental developments in the field of ultra - cold atoms spark renewed excitement  @xcite .",
    "although many theoretical challenges of disordered bosons have been completed successfully , there remains one compelling problem in 1d , raised already in ref .",
    ": does a strong - disorder critical point exist which is qualitatively different from the one found in ref .  ?",
    "that one was established by means of a perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) analysis .",
    "it was later proved to be a generic scenario for finite disorder strength in ref .   while a recent two - loop rg study@xcite is consistent with the latter conclusion . a strong - disorder critical point",
    "would also imply the existence of more than one bose glass phase .",
    "what renders 1d systems special , is the role played by exponentially rare exponentially weak links ( rwls ) . even for a classical - field counterpart of the bosonic system",
    ", weak links can lead to a critical point at which the groundstate loses its macroscopically uniform response to a phase - twist applied at the boundaries @xcite . on the insulating side of this classical transition ,",
    "a macroscopic system becomes equivalent to a single josephson junction with a macroscopically small josephson coupling .",
    "inspired by this observation , altman _",
    "et al . _ proposed the strong - disorder scenario for quantum systems based on a real - space rg treatment @xcite .",
    "as argued in ref .  , the gradual vanishing of the superfluid stiffness down to zero ( corresponding to classical criticality ) would be inconsistent for a quantum system since the proliferation of the instanton  anti - instanton pairs is guaranteed in the thermodynamic limit when the luttinger parameter reaches the critical value @xmath2 ( this phenomenon defines the generic giamarchi - schultz critical point @xcite ) .",
    "for the sf - bg transition , @xmath3 , while for the sf - mg transition , @xmath4 , which is the same as for the sf - mott insulator transition .",
    "thus , the critical value of the luttinger parameter in the putative strong - disorder scenario has to exceed @xmath2  @xcite , which forces the strong - disorder criticality of kosterlitz - thouless type to develop _ prior _ to the generic mechanism of refs .  .",
    "in this paper , we show that the rg flow of @xmath5 can retain its classical - field behavior down to the @xmath6 value , where the universal phenomenon of instanton proliferation inevitably takes place on sufficiently large scales .",
    "this scenario occurs when @xmath7 at the microscopic cutoff scale @xmath8 , _ i.e. _ , in the most natural regime for the putative strong - disorder scenario .",
    "the quantum renormalization of the rwls is irrelevant for the flow behavior . in this limit ,",
    "not only the putative strong - disorder critical point is ruled out , but also the generic instanton - pair induced flow is practically inoperational because of the extremely low fugacity of pairs of mesoscopic size . as a result , a typical system of linear size @xmath9 that should formally be called an insulator , because @xmath10 , retains a superfluid response . this behavior ( illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : gs])as we will later see , this is the hallmark of our scenario , distinguishing it from both the giamarchi - schulz case and the quantum strong - disorder regime advocated in ref .  persists over a broad range of scales till @xmath11 ( see further on in the text ) .",
    "for the same reason of extremely low instanton fugacity the critical rg flow features a pronounced two - stage character ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gs ] , and note that the accessible sizes may be too small to observe both stages of the flow ) , as opposed to the single - stage flow of the hypothetical quantum strong - disorder regime ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : kt ] ) .",
    "renormalization group flow of the luttinger parameter which starts as classical flow and crosses over to the standard kosterlitz - thouless flow at much larger scales if the former saturates to a value slightly above or below @xmath3 .",
    "these large scales may not be available for numerical analysis . ]",
    "we also discuss that a strong - disorder scenario with the critical value of @xmath2 significantly above the gs value may not look quantitatively similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : gs ] because if the classical flow levels off at @xmath12 significantly above the @xmath13 value , the proliferation of instantons with small fugacity ( or backscattering processes ) becomes impossible .",
    "this implies that any strong - coupling scenario with @xmath14 should have a single - stage rg flow illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : kt ] .",
    "we also prove that any quantum critical flow possesses self - averaging properties and thus is subject to asymptotic hydrodynamic description .",
    "as far as we see , this can not be reconciled with any strong - coupling scenario .",
    "single - stage renormalization group flow in the hypothetical strong - coupling scenario .",
    "having passed the correlation length @xmath15 corresponding to the condition @xmath16 , the flow rapidly brings the system to localization . ]",
    "while the condition @xmath17 is necessary to guarantee the applicability of our theory , in practice , the mesoscopic classical - field strong - disorder flow can take place already at @xmath18 , which we clearly see in first - principles simulations of a j - current type model up to system sizes @xmath19 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we develop our theory . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] we address the subtle issues of self - averaging under the conditions of strong disorder , arguing that the observables of choice are the median values and appropriately defined widths rather than the standard cumulants  the expectation value and variance , or the dispersion which is the square root of the variance . in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] we present the model and the results of an illustrative simulation .",
    "our conclusions are formulated in sec .",
    "[ sec:5 ] .",
    "the main assumption  to be justified later  of the instanton approach",
    "@xcite is that up to the critical point the system remains a well - defined luttinger liquid characterized by a finite parameter @xmath12 .",
    "this allows one to describe the coarse - grained behavior of the system with popov s hydrodynamic action @xmath20 $ ] , where @xmath21 is the @xmath22-dimensional field of superfluid phase ( @xmath23 is the spatial coordinate and @xmath24 is the imaginary time re - scaled with the sound velocity @xmath25 ) .",
    "the instantons are the virtual quantum events which result in the phase slips of @xmath26 . in @xmath22 dimensions they are vortices in the field @xmath27 .",
    "an important distinction between the instanton and its 2d vortex counterpart is that the contribution of an instanton to the partition - function integrand comes with the @xmath23-dependent factor @xmath28 , in which the sign is defined by the sense of the vortex rotation and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the disorder - dependent microscopic expectation value of the number density at point @xmath23 . in view of the random phase factor @xmath31 , the net contribution of instantons to the partition function survives after integration over @xmath23 only if instantons come in instanton ",
    "anti - instanton pairs with two @xmath23-coordinates being microscopically close to each other to ensure that their phase factors compensate each other .",
    "[ this is not the case for the mg where exact particle - hole symmetry and commensurability render @xmath32 and the phase factor irrelevant .",
    "it is precisely this aspect that leads to the difference between the @xmath2 values for bg and mg transitions . ] for our purposes , we do not need to consider the general case of rg flow of @xmath5 due to the instanton  anti - instanton ( or vortex - antivortex , for briefness ) pairs .",
    "when the gas of pairs is extremely dilute , the criterion for their proliferation is derived based on the statistics of a single pair with a hierarchy of length scales starting from the microscopic cutoff @xmath8 to the system size @xmath9 being absorbed into the scale dependent value of @xmath33 .",
    "the proliferation takes place when the  effective energy \" of the pair ( in effective temperature units , @xmath34 ) @xmath35 with @xmath36 the ( unknown ) vortex pair core energy , becomes lower than the entropy given by its three degrees of freedom : two in the @xmath37-direction and one in the @xmath23 direction ( there are 4 degrees of freedom for the mg case ) @xmath38 so that the effective free energy turns negative . in the genuine thermodynamic limit of @xmath39 ,",
    "this happens at the universal value @xmath40 . for @xmath41 and given the slow decrease of @xmath12 with distance , an enormously large system size is required for the entropy term to compete with the contribution in @xmath42 coming from distances where @xmath43 .",
    "this explains the extremely low fugacity of the vortex - antivortex pairs and accounts for the fact that @xmath44 can remain larger than @xmath45 even when @xmath5 is already substantially _ lower _ than @xmath2 .    to force a system with large @xmath46 ending up in the insulating state one",
    "needs strong disorder which produces enough weak links to renormalize @xmath12 down to @xmath2 . for the flow to have classical - field character ,",
    "the microscopic physics of rwl does not necessarily have to be classical .",
    "quantum effects can dramatically change the actual strength of the link by dressing it with vortex - antivortex pairs sitting _ right at the link _ ; the effective energy of such pairs can be quite small [ note that a space - time isotropic eq .",
    "( [ eq : vortex_energy ] ) does not apply to rwls ] .",
    "however , in accordance with the result by kane and fisher @xcite ( see also ref .   for the instanton interpretation )",
    "the macroscopic proliferation of vortex - antivortex pairs on a link , no matter how weak , takes place only at @xmath47 ( in the thermodynamic limit ) . hence ,",
    "as long as @xmath48 , the quantum physics of rwls can be absorbed into their renormalized josephson couplings , a circumstance which we rely upon in our analysis , which consequently closely follows ideas developed in ref .  .",
    "to proceed , we have to specify the distribution of rwls . here",
    "we confine ourselves with a ( rather typical ) strong - disorder setup when rwl emerges as a sequence of @xmath49 statistically independent microscopic  insulating \" regions , in which case the probability of finding the rwl somewhere in the system of the ( dimensionless ) size @xmath9 is given by @xmath50 \\",
    ", \\propto\\ ,   ( l/ \\ell_*)\\ , { \\rm e}^{- c_1 \\ell _ * } \\ ; , \\label{eq : prob}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 defines the probability of a single  insulating \" region to occur at a given point .",
    "we are interested in the case when this probability is of order unity , from which the dependence of @xmath49 on system size @xmath9 to logarithmic accuracy follows , @xmath52 the second term is related to the kinchin - kolmogorov law of the iterated logarithm . the josephson coupling @xmath53 over the link is @xmath54 where the function @xmath55 and the constant @xmath56 absorb all the microscopic physics of the weak link .",
    "the inverse of the superfluid stiffness @xmath57 for the system of size @xmath58 is then ( classically ) given by the sum of inverse josephson couplings of rwls , @xmath59 as it will be seen self - consistently , the nature of the flow at the classical critical point , implied by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : josephson ] ) and  ( [ eq : semiclass ] ) , is such that doubling the system size leads only to a minor change in @xmath57 , that is the @xmath53 value of the weakest link gets _ progressively larger _ than @xmath60 as @xmath39 .",
    "hence , a substantial change of @xmath57 happens over a broad range of length scales involving a large number of rwls at different length scales .",
    "this allows one to treat @xmath57 as a slow continuous function of @xmath9 and replace eqs .",
    "( [ eq : josephson])-([eq : semiclass ] ) with the flow equation @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "note that the correction terms are iterated logarithms in the system size . by the same token , the flow of the compressibility with @xmath63 is leaving it constant to this order of accuracy .",
    "the critical condition corresponds to @xmath64 . at this point @xmath65",
    "is decaying logarithmically slowly justifying self - consistently the assumption of being a smooth function of @xmath9 . for @xmath66 , a substantial part of the rg flow remains slow and smooth even on the insulating side @xmath67 .",
    "the flow ( [ eq : flow_ns ] ) predicts @xmath68 .",
    "quantum effects do not change this flow even for @xmath69 until @xmath9 is large enough for free instantons to appear .",
    "the actual quantum critical line corresponds to the regime when the classical critical flow takes the system to @xmath70 .",
    "if @xmath71 , one can reveal how the classical - field flow ultimately crosses over to the universal quantum one only at astronomically large @xmath9 leaving no chances to observe it in a cold gas experiment nor in first - principles simulations .",
    "what can be observed , however , is the anomalous finite - size behavior of the superfluid stiffness . on the superfluid side ( @xmath72 ) , finite size corrections @xmath73 can , in principle , be used to extract the critical parameters of the hamiltonian .",
    "on the insulating side , a typical feature is the development of substantial sample - to - sample fluctuations of @xmath57 reflecting the growing effect of single rwls on @xmath57 . somewhat away from the critical condition @xmath74 ( still considering @xmath75 )",
    "rwls ultimately destroy the self - averaging of @xmath57 [ and thus applicability of eq .",
    "( [ eq : flow_ns ] ) ] at large enough @xmath9 .",
    "one can imagine that in a peculiar regime with condition @xmath76 the self - averaging of @xmath57 survives till @xmath77 , while the suppressed fugacity of instantons prevents the system from having insulating properties .",
    "in such a case , the kane - fisher physics on a single rwl will be responsible for rendering the system insulating at @xmath78 .",
    "the theory developed in this section can be used for processing numeric and/or experimental data , allowing one to predict the behavior of the system in question at much larger sizes and , in particular , extract critical parameters of disorder .",
    "a practical example will be considered in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] , preceded by sec .  [ sec:3 ] in which we address delicate aspects of self - averaging characteristic of the strong - disorder classical - field flow , and formulate appropriate statistical observables to be associated with ( marginally ) self - averaged quantities of the present section .",
    "introduction of the notion of superfluid stiffness as an intensive quantity requires self - averaging in the superfluid phase , at least in a certain minimalistic sense requiring that relative fluctuations of @xmath57 among different disorder realizations be small and get progressively smaller with increasing @xmath9 ( see also further on in this section and in sec.[sec:4 ] for a numerical estimate of the minimum system size required for this to hold in the superfluid phase ) .",
    "the same is true for @xmath79 , the prime object of the analysis of the previous section .",
    "nevertheless , at small @xmath80 , the issue of self - averaging becomes delicate because of the potential divergence of the _ dispersion _ of @xmath79 in the @xmath81 limit @xcite .",
    "[ this divergence does not necessarily contradict with a vanishing characteristic width of the distribution . ]",
    "while not creating fundamental theoretical difficulties , the divergence of dispersion requires some care in processing finite - size data .",
    "obviously , one has to avoid working with the dispersion when characterizing fluctuations of @xmath79 .",
    "correspondingly , in order to characterize the distribution of a random variable @xmath23 we use three typical numbers ( below @xmath82 stands for probability ) : ( i ) the median @xmath83 such that @xmath84=1/2 $ ] , ( ii ) the lower characteristic value @xmath85 such that @xmath86=1/4 $ ] , and ( iii ) the upper characteristic value @xmath87 such that @xmath88=1/4 $ ] .",
    "the width of the distribution is then naturally characterized as @xmath89 .",
    "correspondingly , by the relative width we understand @xmath90 .",
    "a special convenience of working with @xmath91 and @xmath83 is due to the fact that for any random number @xmath92 related to @xmath23 by a monotonic function @xmath93 , we have @xmath94 and @xmath95 , or @xmath96 . in what follows all physical quantities are characterized by their medians and ( relative ) widths , _ not _ the first and the second moments of the distribution functions .",
    "we now prove a theorem that self - averaging in the above mentioned sense takes place at the critical line separating sf and bg phases , no matter whether it is of the gs type , or corresponds to some hypothetical strong - coupling scenario based on weak links , which features a critical value of the luttinger liquid parameter @xmath97 .",
    "finite @xmath2 implies finite critical value of @xmath98 because with the compressibility remaining finite at the critical point we can speak of @xmath12 and @xmath98 interchangeably at the level of their medians .",
    "this is consistent with the most conservative definition of the superfluid phase and the critical point at its boundary as states with non - zero probability density , @xmath99 , of finding a finite value of @xmath100 in the thermodynamic limit @xmath39 .",
    "this leads to a meaningful ( i.e. with non - zero weight over a large - enough finite interval ) limiting function which is allowed  but not _ a priori _ required  to be a @xmath101-function : @xmath102    consider now the process of combining two macroscopically large systems of size @xmath9 into one system of size @xmath103 by adding a link between their edges .",
    "due to the local renormalization of the weak link physics we accept that the contribution of the link to the macroscopic stiffness may depend on properties of the left and right pieces , but not on their macroscopic size .",
    "in other words , if on the left the superfluid stiffness is @xmath23 and on the right it is @xmath37 , then the link distribution function is @xmath104 and the composition law for the probability distribution of @xmath105 in the combined system is [ see ( [ eq : semiclass ] ) ] @xmath106   .",
    "\\qquad \\label{composition1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the distribution of weak links is certainly normalizable .",
    "moreover , even at classical criticality it decays at large @xmath107 as a lorentzian .",
    "since , at any fixed @xmath108 , the ranges of integrations in ( [ composition1 ] ) are finite , we can safely take the limit of @xmath39 and replace @xmath82 with @xmath109 @xmath110   .",

    "( [ composition2 ] ) then yields @xmath111 where @xmath112 since @xmath113 ( without a finite fraction of systems with non - zero @xmath114 , we fail to meet the definition of the critical state with finite @xmath114 ) , from eq .",
    "( [ f_q ] ) we immediately conclude that @xmath115 , meaning that at the critical point the limiting distribution @xmath116 is normalized to unity .    in fourier space ,",
    "( [ composition2 ] ) reads @xmath117 since the last integral corresponds to macroscopically small fourier harmonics of @xmath118 that decay at large @xmath107 at least as fast as a lorentzian , we can replace it with unity [ the leading correction is @xmath119 .",
    "this leaves us with the equation @xmath120 for which we have two options : ( i ) either @xmath121 , or ( ii ) @xmath122 decays exponentially at @xmath123 option ( ii ) is incompatible with the requirement that the function @xmath116 be identically zero at @xmath124 .",
    "hence , we have @xmath125 , i.e. @xmath126 , which proves the theorem .",
    "two remarks are in order to prevent possible confusions . having observed that typical values of @xmath53 in the composition law ( [ composition1 ] ) are of order unity , while the strength of characteristic weak links responsible for , say , the classical flow ( [ eq : flow_ns ] ) is macroscopically small , one may wonder how the two facts should be reconciled with each other , and , in particular , how those macroscopically small links are properly taken into account in the composition law ( [ composition1 ] ) . the first confusion is removed by noting that the weak links in eq .",
    "( [ eq : flow_ns ] ) are being selected throughout the whole system , while the link in the composition law ( [ composition1 ] ) is found at a given position in space , right at the center of the system .",
    "the macroscopic difference in two procedures thus accounts for the macroscopic difference in characteristic values of the corresponding links .",
    "the role of macroscopically weak links is implicit in eq .",
    "( [ composition1 ] )  those links effect the form of the distribution @xmath99 .",
    "our second remark concerns confusing self - averaging with the existence of a finite dispersion .",
    "one should not think that @xmath126 somehow implies a finite dispersion at any finite @xmath9 .",
    "the dispersion depends on the limit taken to obtain the generalized function .",
    "self - similar distributions for random variables based on sums of identical random variables are known in mathematics as _ stable _",
    "distributions.@xcite a distribution for a random variable @xmath127 is said to be stable if for two independent copies @xmath128 and @xmath129 and for any constants @xmath130 it holds that @xmath131 for some constants @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "normal distributions are stable distributions ( by the central limit theorem , when the variance is finite ) , but there exists a _ generalized central limit theorem _ which states that the sum of a number of random variables with power - law tail distributions decreasing as @xmath134 where @xmath135 ( and therefore having infinite variance ) will tend to a stable distribution of the from @xmath136 , with scale parameter @xmath132 which is a measure for the width . note that this goes beyond the law of the large numbers .",

    ". however , one can also envisage situations in a superfluid where the bi - modality due to the divergence of the dispersion is resolved by keeping the location of the center @xmath137 finite while the statistical importance of the tail is irrelevant because of macroscopical pre - factors suppressing the tail ( cf . the stable distributions above ) .",
    "such examples should not be thought of as a different superfluid phase ( from the usual one with vanishing dispersion at any finite @xmath9 ) because self - averaging does take place in the thermodynamic limit with only rare , thermodynamically unimportant fluctuations .",

    "( [ eq : flow_ns ] ) is derived under the assumption of @xmath208 , while @xmath209 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : zeta ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the marginal superfluid behavior persists at @xmath164 and @xmath165 till system sizes of few hundreds .",
    "most importantly , the flows for @xmath164 and @xmath165 go well below the quantum - critical value @xmath3 without any change of their character .",

    "fig : kt ] .    note that for @xmath164 and @xmath165 marginal superfluidity persists till the kane - fisher point @xmath212 , in agreement with our conclusion concerning the suppressed fugacity of instanton  anti - instanton pairs . because for our model the classical separatrix and quantum critical line are so close to each other , there is no chance of seeing a quasi - plateau between @xmath213 and @xmath214 .",
    "the slow flow thus shows that , on physical length scales , we are dealing with a mesoscopic situation where the notion of the thermodynamic state is less meaningful than the flow itself : making cuts at fixed @xmath9 or fixed @xmath215 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dkall ] reveals little information in itself but is meaningful when understood in terms of the flow equations .",
    "hence accurately tracing the evolution of @xmath12 with @xmath9 is absolutely crucial for understanding the underlying physics .",
    "a recent numerical study  @xcite of a particle - hole symmetric ( 1 + 1)-dimensional xy model came to opposite conclusions as the ones presented here .",
    "the authors of ref .   analyzed their data by monitoring the susceptibility , luttinger parameter , and correlation length @xmath107 and found a non - universal @xmath2 for strong enough disorder .",
    "their type of analysis is however incompatible with our data , but we believe that resolving the flow of @xmath12 with @xmath9 on the critical separatrix for strong disorder , which is lacking in the paper , could settle the discrepancy in favor of the theory outlined in this work .",
    "our work proves that strong disorder may lead to a logarithmic flow of the stiffness coming from the classical - field renormalization while compressibility remains constant .",
    "although the universality class of the superfluid to bose glass quantum phase transition does not change , the classical - field mesoscopic physics renders this universality essentially non - observable on physically relevant length scales , since a peculiar mesoscopic behavior persists up to extremely large system sizes .",
    "even deep in the insulating side a physical ( _ e.g. _ , cold - atomic ) system can demonstrate a marginal superfluid response , with strong sample - to - sample fluctuations .",
    "it makes hence little sense to identify the thermodynamic phase for certain hamiltonian parameters if only finite samples are available .",
    "we believe that this mesoscopic behavior , illustrated by numerical data , is the long - sought reconciliation of classical - field criticality with the established picture of the superfluid - to - glass quantum phase transitions ( which remains intact in the academic thermodynamic limit ) .",
    "fitting numerical / experimental data for the superfluid stiffness as a function of disorder and the system size with the classical - field renormalization flow allows one to accurately extract the critical value of disorder and predict the behavior of the system at much larger sizes . in future work",
    ", we plan to employ this theory for completing the sf - bg phase diagrams of the disordered bose - hubbard model in the weakly interacting bose gas regime in three  @xcite , two  @xcite , and one dimension .",
    "finally , we proved that  regardless of the possible divergence of variance of inverse superfluid density  any quantum critical flow possesses self - averaging properties and is thus subject to an asymptotic hydrodynamic description .",
