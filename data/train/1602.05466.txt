    "the experiment is performed in a regime where the effective tunneling rate @xmath55 depends linear on the feedback gate voltage ( see fig .",
    "1e ) , hence we can set @xmath56 where the constant @xmath57 corresponds to the slope of the curve shown in fig .",
    "1e and @xmath58 .",
    "note that in order to have an always positive rate @xmath59 the feedback factor @xmath60 should be relatively small .",

    "@xcite can be reproduced by choosing an infinitesimal small feedback window , @xmath61 , while keeping @xmath62 and @xmath63 finite . for finite @xmath64",

    "<S> all curves show a clear saturation for sufficiently long integration times , indicating the characteristic freezing . </S>",
    "<S> with increasing feedback factor @xmath10 the saturation value becomes smaller which corresponds to a stronger squeezing of the charge fluctuations . for a stationary quantum dot the second cumulant @xmath24 depends on the asymmetry @xmath25 of the two rates @xcite and </S>",
    "<S> the minimum shot noise is observable for a fully symmetric dot @xmath26 . for a direct comparison we plotted this case in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cumulant_dependency]a as well . with feedback </S>",
    "<S> the second cumulant @xmath21 is up to 100 times smaller for the longest calculated integration time and due to the saturation the squeezing @xmath27 growths increasingly .    </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the second cumulant on integration time corresponds to the equation @xmath28 which was first derived for a single barrier with continuous feedback @xcite and which we extended to our applied discrete feedback scheme ( see supplementary ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath29 is the saturation value for long integration times @xmath16 and the relaxation rate @xmath30 describes how fast the fluctuations freeze . </S>",
    "<S> the two parameters are effective values that we gain by fitting eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq:2cumulant ] to the measured curves ( black lines in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cumulant_dependency]a ) . from the fits we find that the saturation value is inversely proportional @xmath31 ( fig . </S>",

    "<S> this indicates that the feedback mechanism is very robust .    in a second experiment we studied the influence of the feedback window @xmath11 by varying it in addition to the feedback factor @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> for every combination we recorded a 5 minute trace with a target rate of 4khz , which corresponds to 1,200,000 tunnel events . </S>",

    "<S> clearly the transition from a weakly feedbacked system on the top left to a strongly feedbacked one on the bottom right is visible . </S>",
    "<S> the saturation therefore depends on both feedback parameters . from the different representation of the saturation values s@xmath34 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cumulant_dependency]d we see that it is actually determined by the response @xmath14 ( as also theoretically shown in the supplementary ) .    </S>",
    "<S> higher cumulants show fluctuations around zero as a function of integration time ( inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cumulant_dependency]e ) instead of freezing at feedback dependent values . </S>",
    "<S> note , however , that without feedback all cumulants would grow linearly in time ; a behaviour which is completely suppressed due to the feedback . on a closer inspection </S>",
    "<S> also the second cumulant fluctuates weakly around its saturation value . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this fluctuating behavior mainly to the statistical error due to the finite experimental counting samples . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless a strong suppression of the amplitudes is observable with increasing feedback response . to characterize the feedback influence we calculated the variance of the cumulants in the range @xmath35 $ ] and plotted the results in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cumulant_dependency]e against the feedback response @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that a power law exists for all extracted quantities with increasing exponent for higher orders . </S>",
    "<S> the solid lines indicate a good agreement with the empirical power law @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> so with increasing feedback response all cumulants become smaller and less noisy as a function of time . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the frozen counting distributions can be well approximated by gaussian functions .    </S>",
    "<S> the maximum feedback response @xmath14 is limited by the experimental boundaries of the quasi linear range . </S>",
    "<S> as already mentioned with increasing feedback response the feedback gate voltage exceeds the boundaries more frequently . </S>",
    "<S> this prevents the complete freezing for very strong feedback and instead the second cumulant exhibits a weak increase with integration time . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless the squeezing is still large , which shows that the feedback loop is very robust even under stronger experimental restrictions .    </S>",
    "<S> to conclude , we successfully implemented an exclusively electronic feedback loop to stabilize the single - electron tunneling process through a quantum dot and analyzed the influence of different feedback parameters with the full counting statistics . </S>",
    "<S> we observed a strong squeezing of shot noise with increasing feedback response @xmath37 and the freezing of the charge fluctuations on sufficient long time scales . </S>",
    "<S> further we showed that the frozen counting statistic is described by a gaussian distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> squeezed current sources open a pathway to high precision measurements in quantum transport . </S>",
    "<S> further improvements are likely with extended feedback protocols or gate dependencies . by integrating the feedback logic high - precision on - chip current sources are possible . </S>",
    "<S> we also like to motivate that similar feedback techniques might be able to correct stochastic pumping errors of frequency driven single - electron current sources which are promising candidates for a redefinition of the ampere @xcite . furthermore , feedback controlled single - electron sources are an ideal platform to test non - equilibrium thermodynamics at the nanoscale ( maxwell s demon)@xcite or to build efficient thermoelectric devices ( energy harvesters)@xcite .    </S>",
