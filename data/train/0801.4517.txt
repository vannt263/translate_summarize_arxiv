    "measurements of luminosity distances using supernovae type ia ( snia ) @xcite , of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature anisotropies with the wmap satellite @xcite , large scale structure @xcite , the integrated sachs ",
    "wolfe effect @xcite , and weak lensing @xcite , indicate that the universe has entered a phase of accelerated expansion -see",
    "@xcite for recent reviews .",
    "this acceleration is explained in terms of an unknown and nearly unclustered matter component of negative pressure , dubbed  dark energy \" ( energy density , @xmath3 ) , that currently contributes with about @xmath4 of the total density .",
    "the remaining @xmath5 is shared between cold dark matter ( @xmath6 ) , baryons ( @xmath7 ) , and negligible amounts of relativistic particles ( photons and neutrinos ) .",
    "the pressureless non - relativistic matter component redshifts faster with expansion than the dark energy , giving rise to the so - called ` coincidence problem ' that seriously affects many models of late acceleration , particularly the @xmath8cdm model :  why are matter and dark energy densities of the same order precisely today ? \" @xcite . to address this problem within general relativity",
    "one must either accept an evolving dark energy field or adopt an incredibly tiny cosmological constant and admit that the  coincidence \" is just that , a coincidence that might be alleviated by turning to anthropic ideas @xcite .",
    "( it should be mentioned , however , the existence of proposals in which a vacuum energy density of about the right order of magnitude arises from the casimir effect at cosmic scales -see @xcite and references therein ) .    one way to address",
    "the coincidence problem , within general relativity , is to assume an interaction ( coupling ) between the dark energy component and cold dark matter such that the ratio @xmath9 evolves from a constant but unstable value at early times ( in the radiation and matter dominated epochs ) to a lower , constant and stable attractor at late times well in the accelerated expansion era @xcite .",
    "before the late accelerated expansion was observed , wetterich introduced interacting quintessence models to reduce the theoretical high value of the cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "later , these kind of models were rediscovered , sometimes ( but not always ) in connection with the coincidence problem -see , e.g. @xcite . other solutions ( known as @xmath10 models )",
    "require the einstein - hilbert action to be modified @xcite .",
    "interacting quintessence models are testable since they predict differences in the expansion rates of the universe , the growth of matter density perturbations , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature anisotropies and in other observables . in this paper",
    "we shall demonstrate that , as the integrated sachs - wolfe effect measures directly the growth rate of matter density perturbations , can be used to detect variations on the evolution of the large scale structure with respect to the prediction of the concordance @xmath8cdm model . as a toy model",
    ", we shall consider a spatially flat friedmann ",
    "walker universe filled with radiation , baryons , dark matter and dark energy such that the last two components interact with each other through a coupling term , @xmath11 .",
    "thus , the energy balance equations for dark matter and dark energy take the form + @xmath12 + where @xmath13 is the equation of state parameter of the dark energy component and @xmath14 is a constant parameter that measures the strength of the interaction ( it should not be confused with the speed of light that we set equal to unity ) .",
    "derivatives are taken with respect to the conformal time , and @xmath15 , with @xmath16 the scale factor of the friedmann - robertson - walker metric . to satisfy the severe constraints imposed by local gravity experiments @xcite , baryons and radiation couple to the other two energy components only through gravity .",
    "our ansatz for @xmath17 guarantees that the ratio between energy densities , @xmath18 , tends to a fixed , attractor , value at late times .",
    "it yields a constant but unstable ratio at early times .",
    "the details of the calculation can be found in @xcite .",
    "this result holds irrespective of whether the dark energy is a quintessence ( i.e. , @xmath19 ) , phantom ( @xmath20 ) , @xmath21-essence or tachyon scalar field @xcite .",
    "it is worth to remark that the above ansatz implies an effective power law potential for the quintessence dark energy field at early times and an effective exponential potential at late times @xcite .    beyond the physical motivation for the existence of a coupling between dark matter and dark energy",
    ", their interaction parameter @xmath14 needs to be constrained by observations . in @xcite",
    "we showed that the slope of the matter power spectrum at small scales decreases and the scale of matter radiation equality is shifted to larger scales with the interaction .",
    "cmb temperature anisotropies are equally affected if the interaction is present at decoupling .",
    "the luminosity distance of snia depends on the expansion rate of the universe and can be used to test the existence of a dm / de coupling .",
    "comparison of model predictions with data showed that only wmap 3yr data and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data provided constraints on the value of @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "in particular , the snia data proved to be rather insensitive to the coupling . in this paper",
    "we show that the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) component of the cmb temperature anisotropies is much more sensitive than the snia data at redhisfts @xmath23 .",
    "it measures the growth factor of linear matter density perturbations , that is strongly affected by the interaction and can effectively set constraints on interacting quintessence models ( iqm ) .",
    "other experiments that also constrain the growth rate are discussed in @xcite . in section",
    "ii we briefly summarize the formalism behind the measurements of the isw effect by cross - correlating cmb data with galaxy catalogs . in section iii",
    "we describe the observational prospects and in section iv we present our conclusions .",
    "when cmb photons in their way to the observer from the surface of last scattering , cross a time - varying potential well , experience the so called late integrated sachs - wolfe effect .",
    "photons are blueshifted ( redshifted ) when entering ( leaving ) a high dense region , and similarly for low dense regions .",
    "if the gravitational potential @xmath24 evolves during a photon crossing like in models with a cosmological constant , then both effects will not compensate each other and the final energy of the photon will vary",
    ". the net effect will be @xcite , + @xmath25 + the integral is taken with respect to conformal distance ( or look - back time ) from the observer at redshift @xmath26 , @xmath27 where the hubble factor , @xmath28 , obeys friedmann s equation , @xmath29 .",
    "the evolution of the newtonian potential will be computed numerically , but its qualitative behavior can be understood from the perturbed einstein s equations . once the universe becomes matter dominated , we can write in the conformal newtonian gauge @xcite : + @xmath30 + where the sum is over all matter fluids and scalar fields , @xmath31 , @xmath32 are the density parameter and the energy density contrast , respectively , of fluid @xmath33 .",
    "derivatives are also taken with respect to conformal time . in non - interacting models , the gravitational potential changes",
    "when ( a ) the equation of the state of the background varies , and ( b ) the dark energy is smoothly distributed , i.e. , it does not cluster on scales below the  sound horizon \" , set by @xmath34 .",
    "at that point the potential will decay and generate an isw effect @xcite . during the matter",
    "dominated epoch , the matter sound speed is @xmath35 . if @xmath36 , then the dark energy fluid does not cluster on scales below the horizon @xcite , whereby @xmath37 . in this case , on subhorizon scales the gravitational potential evolves as @xmath38 , i.e. , it essentially remains constant .",
    "however , in models with interaction , the cdm energy density does not scale as @xmath39 because of the coupling . during the matter",

    "we solved the system of equations that describes the evolution of all energy components and the newtonian potentials using a modified version of the cmbfast code @xcite .",
    "as the figure shows , when @xmath51 , @xmath24 remains constant during the matter dominated epoch , and it decays solely during the phase of accelerated expansion .",
    "by contrast , in interacting models the potential @xmath24 decays even during matter domination .",
    "= 0.85    the isw effect is not the only anisotropy generated by local structures .",
    "secondary anisotropies could be generated due to non - linear evolution of the gravitational potential , usually associated with the gravitational collapse of small scale structures like clusters @xcite .",
    "but the relevant scales are those of clusters and superclusters , corresponding to angular scales of @xmath52 arcmin , much smaller than those associated to the isw effect .",
    "the isw component can not be measured directly , i.e. , can not be extracted from cmb data using frequency information since it the same frequency dependence that any other intrinsic cmb signal . since at low redshifts is generated by local structures , the spatial pattern of isw anisotropies will correlate with the matter distribution in the local universe . the contribution to the radiation power spectrum due to the evolution of the gravitational potential at low redshifts is given by @xcite + @xmath53 + where + @xmath54 + in this expression , @xmath55 is the ratio of the growth of matter density perturbations in any cosmological model , @xmath56 , to that in a einstein - de sitter universe , @xmath57 ; @xmath58 is the present hubble radius and @xmath59 are spherical bessel functions . in figure",

    "=    due to the isw component , cmb temperature maps will correlate with tracers of the gravitational potential at low redshifts that could be constructed from galaxy catalogs .",
    "in particular , it will correlate with templates of the projected galaxy density along the line of sight . assuming the distribution of galaxies follows that of the dark matter , the correlation of a template of projected galaxy density and a cmb map can be computed analytically @xcite , + @xmath68 + with + @xmath69 + where @xmath70 is the window function of the tracer of the large scale gravitational potential",
    ", @xmath71 is the scale dependent bias existing between sources and the matter distribution as a function of radial distance @xmath18 , @xmath72 is the normalized redshift distribution of sources and @xmath73 is the growth function of matter density perturbations .",
    "similarly , the power spectrum of the galaxy catalog is given by + @xmath74 + one advantage of using eq .",
    "( [ eq : cl_iswm ] ) is that it separates the contribution coming from redshift evolution and from the spatial distribution of the large scale structure .",
    "models of structure formation that give rise to the same matter power spectrum but differ in their growth rate , @xmath56 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : growth]b ) , will also give rise to isw effects of different amplitude .",
    "consequently , the correlation with galaxy catalogs will also differ .",
    "if the interaction varies with time and is only significant at present , the shape of the matter power spectrum will be unaffected but the growth rate will not .",
    "therefore , the isw effect will be sensitive to the existence of the interaction through the influence of the latter on the growth rate of density perturbations . in the next section",
    ", we shall fix the matter power spectrum of all models with interaction to be the same as a model with @xmath51 ( no interaction ) and the same cosmological parameters .",
    "we considered only power spectra that were compatible in amplitude and shape with the spectra derived from the sdss and 2dgf galaxy catalogs @xcite .",
    "thus , differences in the correlation between templates of projected galaxy density and cmb data -eq.([eq : cl_iswm])- will reflect differences in the growth ratio @xmath61 only and will indicate how sensitive the isw effect is to the redshift evolution of matter density perturbations .",
    "after the release of wmap 1yr data , several groups looked for evidence of isw effect by cross - correlating the wmap data with templates built from different catalogs : the nvss radio survey @xcite , the hea0-i x - ray background map @xcite , the apm @xcite , the sdss @xcite , and the 2mass galaxy surveys @xcite .",
    "these analyses rely on constructing templates from catalogs as tracers of the isw signal .",
    "cross - correlation of random realizations of cmb data and noise provides an estimate of the uncertainties .",
    "catalogs differed in depth and sky coverage and different groups use different techniques : real space correlation , correlations in fourier space , wavelets analysis , etc . , and obtained positive detections with levels of significance of @xmath75 .",
    "these detections represent an independent evidence for the existence of dark energy , though , at the moment , the measurements are not accurate enough to discriminate between competing dark energy scenarios .    in this section ,",
    "we analyze the prospects that the isw effect could be potentially sensitive to the growth rate of matter density perturbations and , therefore , to the dark energy  dark matter coupling . the effect of the interaction is to increase the amplitude of the cross - correlation of template and cmb data : the interaction makes the gravitational potentials decay faster which produces a larger isw effect , making it easier to detect . if we trace the isw effect with a template @xmath76 that covers a fraction @xmath77 of the sky , the cumulative signal to noise ratio is given by @xcite + @xmath78 + where @xmath79 is the power spectrum of the template @xmath76 .",
    "the sum extends to the largest angular scale resolved by the template .",
    "the main source of confusion in isw measurements comes from the intrinsic cmb anisotropies . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sn ] ) we have neglected the instrumental noise of wmap data and the shot noise of the template map .",

    "[ fig : signal_noise ] it is seen that increasing the strength of the interaction augments the s / n ratio reflecting the fact that , as the interaction generates larger isw signal , it can be detected with higher statistical significance .",

    "the measured correlation function in eq . ( [ eq : isw - correlation ] ) is affected by masking , pixelization and the inhomogeneities within the catalog of the galaxy selection function across the sky .",
    "further , the free electrons that reside in the deep potential wells of galaxy clusters contribute to the temperature anisotropies via the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect @xcite , that dilute the isw signature at zero lag @xcite .",
    "for example , templates constructed with the 2mass catalog of galaxies are known to trace the thermal sz component @xcite as well the isw effect . to avoid a possible thermal sz contamination , we will compare the mean between @xmath94 and @xmath95 of the predicted and measured correlation functions .",

    "the isw effect may provide an excellent tool to detect , in a model independent way , the coupling between dark energy and dark matter at low redshifts , i.e. , @xmath122 .",
    "the interaction damps the growing mode of the newtonian potential faster compared to models with no interaction and enhances the isw effect ; then , the isw effect is sensitive to the growth rate of matter density perturbations , but model predictions need to be refined to model more realistically the selection function of galaxy catalogs .",
    "we have shown that the correlation of wmap with templates constructed from different galaxy catalogs can rule out an interaction parameter of @xmath112 at better than the 99.95% confidence level .",
    "for this type of models , this upper limit is stronger than those obtained previously using the cmb radiation power spectrum @xcite , but at a different redshift .",
    "the isw effect shows more statistical power to discriminate among iqm models than the luminosity distance test obtained using snia .",
    "the recent results in @xcite suggest a discrepancy between the fraction of dark energy necessary to explain the amplitude of the isw effect ( measured from cross - correlating cmb data and galaxy catalogs ) larger than allowed by the wmap 3yr data .",
    "we have shown that the tension between both data sets could be explained by introducing a moderate coupling between dark energy and dark matter .",
    "this is in line with recent claims that the layzer - irvine equation @xcite when applied to galaxy clusters reveals the existence of a dm / de coupling @xcite .",
    "if the aforesaid discrepancy is confirmed by deeper and wider galaxy samples , it could turn out an indirect evidence for the existence of a dm / de interaction .",

    "<S> values of @xmath2 are compatible with the data and may account for the possible discrepancy between the fraction of dark energy derived from wmap 3yr data and the fraction obtained from the isw effect . </S>",
    "<S> measuring the fraction of dark energy by these two methods could provide evidence of an interaction . </S>"
