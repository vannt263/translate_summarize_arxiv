    "the stability of superheavy elements ( she ) with atomic numbers @xmath5 is entirely due to quantum shell effects . without such shell effects ,",
    "strong coulomb repulsion between the protons would lead to immediate spontaneous fission .",
    "therefore , one of the most important subjects in the study of she is nuclear shell structure .",
    "however , due to low population cross sections , experimental information on she is generally limited to half - lives and @xmath6-decay energies , which can only be indirectly related to the shell structure . only very recently were electromagnetic transitions observed for the first time in the decay chain of @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "after decades of experimental studies , the heaviest she so far produced has proton number @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "nuclei in the nobelium ( @xmath9 ) region are unique in the sense that they are the heaviest systems where detailed spectroscopic information is available  @xcite . with numerous rotational bands observed  @xcite , the ground states of these nuclei are known to be well deformed , with prolate @xmath10 shapes .",
    "although the she in the elusive superheavy island of stability are thought to be spherical , it can be expected that a proper description of the single - particle ( s.p . )",
    "structures in the nobelium region would result in a better extrapolation of the shell structure towards the superheavy region .",
    "theoretical calculations in the nobelium region have been limited to various mean - field models , which can be divided into two large categories : those based on the microscopic - macroscopic model  @xcite , and those using self - consistent approaches  @xcite .",
    "the latter used non - relativistic zero - range skyrme  @xcite or finite - range gogny  @xcite forces as well as relativistic lagrangians  @xcite .",
    "all these calculations reproduce reasonably well the gross features of experimental rotational spectra , however , differences can be found on detailed inspection .",
    "experimental quasiparticle energies of odd-@xmath11 systems in the nobelium region show better agreement with the microscopic - macroscopic calculations  @xcite , which have deformed shell gaps open at @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "none of the self - consistent approaches , whether in the non - relativistic or relativistic variant , predict such deformed shell gaps for both protons and neutrons ; a few of them predict the @xmath3 or @xmath4 shell openings , but not both  @xcite .",
    "the fine details of the shell structure depend on small changes of the model parameters .",
    "up to now , the parameters have been mostly determined by global adjustments to various experimental data across the nuclear chart .",
    "it is extremely gratifying to see that these adjustments of a few parameters give a fair overall agreement with a large body of data .",
    "however , through these adjustments , a precise description of particular experimental features in a given region of nuclei , such as the transuranium elements , has not been obtained .",
    "the most advanced adjustments of parameters with full error analyses have been performed for the skyrme energy - density functionals ( edfs )  @xcite .",
    "it is by now quite clear that within a limited parametrization of this force , further improvements towards globally precise results are not possible  @xcite .",
    "much less work in this direction has been done for the relativistic approaches and almost none for the gogny interaction and microscopic - macroscopic models , however , one can reasonably expect that similar conclusions may hold there too .",
    "various strategies of extending simple parametrizations are now being investigated . however , before these become available and eventually achieve a higher level of precision , one has to look into the possibility of local adjustment of parameters .",
    "this is the strategy adopted in the present work . in doing so ,",
    "the idea of ref .",
    "@xcite is followed , where so - called spectroscopic - quality parametrizations , which focus on adjusting the shell - structure properties of nuclei , were proposed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec2 ] the parameters of the model are defined and various adjustments of parameters are discussed . in sec.[sec4 ] the results obtained are presented and analyzed . finally , in sec.[sec5 ] the conclusions that can be drawn from the study are presented .",
    "in this study , calculations were performed using the symmetry - unrestricted solver hfodd ( v2.52j )  @xcite .",
    "the skyrme hartree - fock - bogolyubov ( shfb ) equations were solved by expanding the mean - field wave functions on 680 deformed harmonic - oscillator ( ho ) basis states , with ho frequencies of @xmath12mev and @xmath13mev .",
    "this corresponds to including the ho basis states up to @xmath14 and @xmath15 quanta . to study any possible impact of the finite ho space",
    ", calculations were also performed using a larger basis of 969 states and @xmath16 and @xmath17 quanta .    in odd - mass nuclei , quasiparticle excitations are obtained by blocking the relevant levels when performing the shfb calculations .",
    "the procedure closely follows that of ref .",
    "the excitation spectra are obtained by taking differences of the total energies obtained by blocking different orbitals .",
    "the recently proposed skyrme parametrization unedf1  @xcite was used , for which local adjustments of the spin - orbit ( so ) strength were performed , while keeping all other parameters unchanged ( see below ) .",
    "the parameter set obtained is denoted by unedf1@xmath18 . for comparison",
    ", the results obtained using an older standard skyrme parametrization sly4  @xcite were calculated .",
    "the final calculations were performed for the force unedf1@xmath19 , for which the time - odd coupling constants were determined by the landau parameters and local - gauge - invariance arguments , as defined in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the pairing channel ,",
    "the mixed pairing force  @xcite was adopted , both with and without lipkin - nogami ( ln ) approximate particle - number projection  @xcite .",
    "these two variants of the calculation are denoted by shfb+ln and shfb , respectively . in both cases , the strengths of the pairing force for neutrons ( @xmath20 ) and protons ( @xmath21 ) were adjusted either to the odd - even mass staggering or first ( kinematic ) moments of inertia ( moi ) @xmath22@xmath23 .",
    "experimental and theoretical pairing gaps were estimated by using the three - point - mass - difference formula , which takes into account the influence of the deformation and blocking effects  @xcite .",

    "levels in the transuranium region comes from the energy spectra of @xmath1cf and @xmath2bk  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the shfb+ln blocking calculations were performed for these two nuclei and the excitation spectra obtained were compared with experimental data , see fig .  [ fig3 ] . in general",
    ", it is found that for sly4 and unedf1 , correct orbitals appear near the fermi surface , however , the detailed agreement is not fully satisfactory . it should be noted that with the most recent parametrization of ref .",
    "@xcite , this situation does not improve .",
    "the most conspicuous differences between the data and calculations relate to positions of the intruder levels , which are highly dependent on the so coupling constants @xmath24 and @xmath25 of the skyrme edfs .",
    "the possibility of reproducing the experimental spectra in odd - mass nuclei by changing the so strengths was already discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this work",
    ", focus was placed on the excitation energies of the @xmath26 state in @xmath1cf with respect to the @xmath27 ground state and of the @xmath28 state in @xmath2bk that is very close to the @xmath29 ground state . in theory",
    ", they correspond to the relative energies between the neutron ( @xmath30 $ ] ) and proton ( @xmath31 $ ] ) intruder levels , and the corresponding normal - parity states @xmath32 $ ] and @xmath33 $ ] , respectively .",
    "the adjustment of parameters was performed by repeating the following two steps :    * by assuming a linear dependence of the neutron and proton excitation energies described above on the two coupling constants @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the experimental and theoretical excitation energies of the @xmath26 state in @xmath1cf and @xmath28 state in @xmath2bk were matched . * by assuming a linear dependence of the neutron and proton mass staggering on the two pairing strengths , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the experimental and theoretical values obtained from the mass tables of ref .",
    "@xcite , that is , @xmath34 and @xmath35kev were matched .    in reality",
    ", it was found that the aforementioned dependencies were not strictly linear , and that the two steps were not really independent from one another , such that the procedure had to be repeated a few times , each time iterating toward the final desired values .",

    "( [ so ] ) define the parameterization unedf1@xmath18 .",
    "since four theoretical parameters were adjusted to reproduce four experimental data points , no estimates of the error in the adjusted values are possible . however , the readjusted values ( [ so ] ) and ( [ vnvp ] ) are still within 23@xmath37 deviations from the unedf1 values ( see the uncertainties @xmath37 that were estimated in ref .",
    "in fact , it may very well be that a full readjustment of the unedf1 parameter set , performed with constraints on energy levels in the nobelium region , could result in a fit of a similar quality to that obtained for the original force .",

    "both the gaps and the moi are not only sensitive functions of pairing , but also depend on other fine details of the shell structure , which still can be imperfect , even after our careful adjustments of the so strengths . finally , for consistency , all results presented in this study were obtained with scaled pairing strengths of eqs .",

    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "tests performed for a larger ho basis of 969 states allow the precision of the results obtained to be estimated .",

    "this shows that values of the pairing strengths given in eqs .",
    "( [ vnvp])([vnvpf2 ] ) pertain to the specific size of the ho basis and can not be considered as having any universal significance .",

    "in the present work , the rotational properties of very heavy nuclei have been investigated through the magnifying glass of a spectroscopic - quality energy density functional , which was specifically adjusted to this region of nuclei .",

    "moreover , the obtained deformed shell structure then revealed pronounced shell gaps , which opened up at @xmath4 and @xmath3 , again in agreement with general features of the experimental data in this region of nuclei . cranking calculations performed with the modified parameters also gave a fair agreement with experiment .",
    "however , under detailed comparison at a much finer level than usually performed , the following deficiencies of the description were revealed :    * the pairing strengths needed for the precise description of the odd - even mass staggering and those needed for a precise description of the moments of inertia are not exactly the same . *",
    "the approximate particle - number projection , performed using the lipkin - nogami method , gives a dependence of moments of inertia on particle numbers which is too smooth .",
    "it seems that the particle - number restoration washes out the deformed shell gaps , which is not compatible with data .",
    "this is puzzling , as in principle the particle - number conserving approach should give a superior description of the experimental data .",
    "it is suggested that , within the current restricted parametrizations of the energy density functionals , further global improvement of precision in reproducing experimental data is unlikely . of course ,",
    "much more work is needed before extended parametrizations can be implemented and tested . in the mean time , local focused adjustments , like the one performed in this study , can give hints as to which elements of the description need more attention than others .",
