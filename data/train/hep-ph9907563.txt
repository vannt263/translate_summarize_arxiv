    "different types of hadronic models describe various aspects of baryon physics . among them",
    "are nonrelativistic quark models , various sorts of bag models and approaches describing baryons by means of collective variables like topological or non - topological solitons @xcite .",
    "most of these models are designed to work in the low energy region and generally do not match the calculations within perturbative qcd .",
    "considering the great experimental progress in the medium energy range @xcite , there is a high demand for models describing baryon physics in this region that connects the low and high energy regimes . to make progress in this direction we investigate a covariant formulation of a diquark - quark - model of baryons .",
    "our motivation to choose such an approach is fed from two sources . on the one hand ,",
    "when starting with the fully relativistic faddeev equation for bound states of three quarks , diquarks appear as effective degrees of freedom .",
    "these diquarks stand for correlated quark - quark pairs inside baryons .",
    "thus they should not be confused with the notion of diquark condensates in the context of colour superconductivity . on the other hand , diquarks as constituents of baryons are naturally obtained when one starts with an njl - type of model of colour octet flavour singlet quark currents @xcite .",
    "although in the limit @xmath0 baryons emerge as solitons of meson fields @xcite , it can be shown for the case of three colours that both effects , binding through quark exchange in the diquark - quark picture and through mesonic effects , contribute equally @xcite .",
    "starting from the faddeev equation , one can approximate the two - quark irrreducible @xmath1-matrix by separable contributions that can be viewed as loosely bound diquarks .",
    "the full three - body problem reduces then to a two - body one , in which bound states appear as the solution of a homogeneous bethe - salpeter equation . the attractive interaction between quark and diquark",
    "is hereby provided by quark exchange . in @xcite",
    "we formalize this procedure by an effective lagrangian containing constituent quark , scalar diquark and axialvector diquark fields .",
    "this leads to a coupled set of bethe - salpeter equations for octet and decuplet baryons .",
    ".components of the octet baryon wave function with their respective spin and orbital angular momentum .",
    "@xmath2 corresponds to scalar and @xmath3 to axialvector diquark correlations .",
    "note that the partial waves in the first row possess a non - relativistic limit .",
    "see @xcite for further details . [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we avoid unphysical thresholds by an effective parameterization of confinement in the quark and diquark propagators .",
    "we then solve the complete four - dimensional bethe - salpeter equation in ladder approximation and obtain wave functions for the octet and decuplet baryons @xcite .",
    "the lorentz invariance of our model has been checked explicitly by choosing different frames .",
    "the implementation of the appropriate dirac and lorentz representations of the quark and diquark parts of the wave functions leads to a unique decomposition in the rest frame of the baryon .",
    "besides the well known @xmath4-wave and @xmath5-wave components of non - relativistic formulations of the baryon octet we additionally obtain non - negligible @xmath6-wave contributions which demonstrates again the need for covariantly constructed models .",
    "table [ wave ] summarizes the structure of the octet wave function .",
    "each of the eight components is to be multiplied with a scalar function which is given in terms of an expansion in hyperspherical harmonics and is computed numerically .    in order to obtain the mass spectra for the octet and decuplet baryons we explicitly break su(3 ) flavour symmetry by a higher strange quark constituent mass . using the nucleon and the delta mass as input our calculated mass spectra @xcite are in good agreement with the experimental ones ,",
    "see table [ masses ] .",
    "the wave functions for baryons with distinct strangeness content but same spin differ mostly due to flavour clebsch - gordan coefficients , the respective invariant functions being very similar . due to its special role among the other baryons , we investigated the @xmath7 hyperon in more detail and discussed its vertex amplitudes . in our approach",
    ", the @xmath7 acquires a small flavour singlet admixture which is absent in @xmath8 symmetric non - relativistic quark models .",

    "a significant test and a first application of our model is the calculation of various form factors @xcite .",
    "the most important ingredient are the fully four - dimensonal wave functions described above .",
    "it turns out that already the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon provide severe resctrictions for the parameters of the model .",
    "the pion - nucleon form factor is calculated in view of its possible use in a spectator model for nucleon - nucleon scattering processes . at the soft point ,",
    "@xmath17 , we find good agreement with experiment . in the spacelike region",
    "our @xmath18 falls like a monopole with a large cutoff used also in one - boson - exchange ( obe ) models .",
    "compared with a calculation including only scalar diquarks @xcite we find a lower value for the pion - nucleon coupling at the soft point .",
    "serving as a central ingredient for strangeness production processes the kaon - nucleon - lambda form factor @xmath19 is an issue of special interest . due to flavour algebra the isospin configuration of the @xmath7 singles out the scalar diquark as the only diquark contributing to nucleon - lambda transitions . with a pseudoscalar kaon not coupling to the scalar diquark",
    "we find ourselves in a comfortable position to handle such transitions .",
    "results can be found in a forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "going beyond the calculation of form factors we work on the application of our approach to production processes like kaon photoproduction and the associated strangeness production close to threshold .",
    "great experimental progress in the last few years gave access to kinematical as well as some spin observables due to self - analyzing @xmath7 decay .",
    "we try to reproduce these observables in our model with the aim to get further insight into the mechanisms of strangeness production inside the nucleon .    in the case of kaon photoproduction , @xmath20 ,",
    "preliminary results are gained by computing the left diagram of fig .",
    "[ pics ] and the corresponding one with photon and kaon line crossed .",
    "although the outcome of the total cross section is encouraging , the result for the polarisation asymmetries of the @xmath7 falls too short .",
    "additionally , we describe the process @xmath21 employing an obe - picture for internuclear forces . from our viewpoint , the diquarks act as mere spectators , so that the exchanged bosons couple only to the valence quarks of the baryons . in a first step we investigate the contributions stemming from pseudoscalar kaon and pion interchange between these two protons .",
    "the latter process is depicted in the right diagram of fig .",
    "if instead of the pion a kaon is exchanged , the upper part of this diagram changes to the form factor @xmath19 .",
    "possible applications are not exhausted by these examples .",
    "the diquark spectator picture can be extended to , _",
    "e.g. _ , real and virtual compton scattering .",
    "the quark structure functions ( see also @xcite ) , which are obtained from the imaginary part of the virtual compton scattering amplitude , would allow a comparison with the results of perturbative calculations .",
