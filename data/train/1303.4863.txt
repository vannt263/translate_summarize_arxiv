    "in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics with a single higgs there are enormously various hierarchies of quark and lepton yukawa couplings , _ that is _ , @xmath13 etc .. in addition , there are several fundamental questions in yukawa sector : why the top quark is uniquely so big compared with the other fermions , why neutrino masses are so small and so mild compared with the other charged fermions , why both the three leptonic mixing angles and one quark mixing angle are large , while the two quark mixing angles are so small . in some sense , our understanding of fermion masses and mixing angles remains at a very primitive level .",
    "one of the approaches often adopted in the understanding for a possible solution for the flavor puzzle consists of the introduction of family symmetries which constrain the flavor structure of yukawa couplings and lead to predictions for fermion masses and mixings .",
    "we propose a simplified way to address those questions in a non - abelian discrete symmetry @xmath0  @xcite , by both introducing six types of higgs fields and imposing all yukawa couplings being of order one .",

    "after the relatively large reactor angle @xmath17 measured in daya bay and reno  @xcite including double chooz , t2k and minos experiments  @xcite , the most recent analysis based on global fits  @xcite of the neutrino oscillations enters into a new phase of precise determination of mixing angles and mass squared differences , indicating that the tbm mixing for three flavors should be corrected in the lepton sector : their allowed ranges at @xmath10 @xmath18 from global fits are given by @xmath19 @xmath20=7.50^{+0.18~(+0.59)}_{-0.19~(-0.50)}~,~\\delta m^{2}_{\\rm atm}[10^{-3}{\\rm ev}^{2}]=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll }                  2.473^{+0.070~(+0.222)}_{-0.067~(-0.197)}~ , & \\hbox{nmh } \\\\                  2.427^{+0.042~(+0.185)}_{-0.065~(-0.222)}~ , & \\hbox{imh}~                                    \\end{array } ,                                  \\right .",

    "<S> we propose a new model of leptons and quarks based on the discrete flavor symmetry @xmath0 , the double covering of @xmath1 , in which the hierarchies of charged fermion masses and the mildness of neutrino masses are responsible for higgs scalars . </S>",
    "<S> after spontaneous breaking of flavor symmetry , with the constraint of renormalizability in the lagrangian , the leptons have @xmath2 and the quarks have the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mixing angles @xmath3 and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , certain effective dimension-5 operators are introduced , which induce @xmath5 and lead the quark mixing matrix to the ckm one in form . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the neutrino lagrangian still keeps renormalizability . for completeness , we show numerical analysis : in the lepton sector , only normal mass hierarchy is permitted within @xmath6 experimental bounds with the prediction of both large deviations from maximality in the atmospheric mixing angle @xmath7 and the measured values of reactor angle . </S>",
