    "the universal physics of few particles interacting with resonant short - range interactions , commonly referred to as efimov physics  @xcite , has intensively studied in recent years both experimentally and theoretically ( e.g.@xcite for a review ) .",
    "the resonant short - range two - body interaction with the @xmath4-wave scattering length @xmath5 at the unitary limit @xmath6 generates the effective three - body attraction that supports an infinite number of weakly bound three - body states , known as the efimov trimers , with the peculiar geometric universal scaling of their energies . for a potential with a finite scattering length @xmath5 ,",
    "only a finite number of the three - body bound states exist . the critical scattering length , @xmath7 , for the appearance of the first efimov state at the three - body threshold on the @xmath8 side , often referred to as the three - body parameter , was initially considered as a nonuniversal quantity to be affected by the short - range details of the interactions . the absolute position of @xmath7 , which determines the overall scale of the whole efimov spectrum ,",
    "is not predicted by the low - energy effective theories  @xcite .",
    "however , several recent experiments with identical ultracold alkali atoms suggested that the three - body parameter @xmath7 might be universal since the observed values in refs .",
    "@xcite are approximately the same in units of the van der waals length @xmath2 for different atoms , as summarized in refs .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath9 with the atomic mass @xmath10 and the coefficient @xmath11 of the long - range potential @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "this interesting result has stimulated the theoretical studies in refs .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , with a numerical study in the adiabatic hyperspherical representation , the universality of the three - body parameter @xmath13 has been understood as follows : the origin of the universality is related to the suppression of the probability to find two particles at distances @xmath14 where the pairwise interaction features a deep well supporting many two - body bound states or a short - range hardcore repulsion .",
    "this suppression leads to the formation of the universal three - body potential barrier around the three - body hyperradius @xmath15 ( see eq .  ( 2.2 ) below for the definition of the @xmath16-body hyperradius ) .",
    "this barrier prevents the three particles from simultaneously getting close together to explore nonuniversal features of the interactions at short distances .",
    "reference  @xcite elaborated on this physical mechanism by elucidating how the two - body suppression leads to appearance of the universal barrier at @xmath15 .    as for the @xmath0he trimer interacting with a realistic @xmath0he potential that has a strong repulsive core at @xmath17 and supports only one two - body bound state , one of the present authors ( e.h . ) and the collaborators  @xcite showed , by performing a nonadiabatic three - body calculation , @xmath7 is consistent with the observed value of the three - body parameter in alkali atoms when scaled with the effective range .",
    "one of the aims of the present paper is , using the same framework , the gaussian expansion method ( gem )  @xcite for few - body systems , as in our previous papers  @xcite and @xcite ( hereafter referred to as paper i and respectively ) , to calculate the efimov spectra of the @xmath0he trimer with the seven different realistic @xmath0he potentials  @xcite .",
    "we show that the calculated three - body parameters @xmath18 for the ground @xmath19 and excited @xmath20 states are independent of the difference in the short - range details of the realistic potentials and are consistent with the observed values of the first and second efimov resonances in the experiments for the alkali trimers when scaled with the van der waals length .    from the @xmath0he trimer wave functions described with the three sets of the jacobi coordinates , we derive the three - body potential @xmath21 as a function of the three - body hyperradius @xmath22 and",
    "show that @xmath21 has a repulsive core at @xmath23 and the three - body probability density inside the core is heavily suppressed both in the ground and excited states .",
    "this supports , from the view point of the realistic interactions , the finding  @xcite of the appearance of the three - body repulsion universally at @xmath23 in the first efimov trimer state .",
    "as long as the tetramers of the alkali atoms are concerned , recent experiments have observed the scattering lengths @xmath24 and @xmath25 , at which the first and second universal four - body states tied to the first efimov trimer state emerges at the four - body threshold on the @xmath8 side .",
    "the data  @xcite exhibit a universal property @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "another aim of this paper is to calculate the four - body efimov spectra of the @xmath0he tetramer states ( @xmath28 ) associated with the trimer ground state using the same realistic @xmath0he potentials as above and present that the calculated values of the @xmath24 and @xmath25 are independent of the details of the potentials at short inter - particle separations and do not contradict the observed values when scaled with the van der waals length . from the calculated tetramer wave function described with the full 18 sets of the jacobi",
    "coordinates , we derive a four - body potential @xmath29 as a function of the four - body hyperradius @xmath30 and show that the repulsive core is located at @xmath31 and the four - body probability density inside the core is heavily suppressed both in the ground and excited states .",
    "the region suppressed by the three-(four-)body barrier in the @xmath0he trimer ( tetramer ) is significantly larger than the region that is trivially excluded by the two - body repulsive core at @xmath17 , which makes the critical scattering lengths insensitive to the short - range physics .",
    "it is to be noted that the present work has the following limitation : the realistic @xmath0he-@xmath0he potential with the van der waals tail is a single - channel potential into which excitation of the interacting particles is renormalized , and no excited channel is explicitly incorporated in the present framework .",
    "therefore , we shall compare our results with the property of the broad feshbach resonances in the ultracold alkali atoms and consider that our single - channel model is not applicable to the narrow resonances generated by the multi - channel effects ( cf .",

    "summary is given in sec .",
    "soon after the efimov effect was predicted in the early 1970s , the @xmath0he trimer was expected to have bound states of efimov type since the @xmath0he-@xmath0he interaction gives a large scattering length @xmath36 @xmath1 ( much greater than the potential range @xmath37  ) and a very small @xmath0he dimer binding energy @xmath38 mk with the large mean radius @xmath39  .",
    "this fact strongly stimulated a large number of three - body calculations of @xmath0he atoms , which predicted existence of the ground state and a very weakly bound excited states ( references in papers i and ii as well as the latest result for the @xmath0he dimer , trimer and tetramer using realistic @xmath0he potentials ) .",
