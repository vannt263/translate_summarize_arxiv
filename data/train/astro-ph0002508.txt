    "the largest sample of high redshift galaxies was selected from observations of the extinction of rest - frame far - ultraviolet light by intrinsic and intergalactic absorption .",
    "these lyman break galaxies ( hereafter lbgs ; steidel et al .",
    "1996 ) may , in principle , be the tracers of the global star formation history of the universe ( madau et al .",
    "however , the unquantified effects of dust extinction present an obstacle to such interpretation . for example , corrections to the star formation rate ( sfr ) of lbgs have been suggested to be as large as factors of 210 ( pettini et al .",
    "1998 , hereafter p98 ; trager et al . 1997 ) .",
    "in this paper we present the first observations of an lbg with nirspec , the near infrared spectrometer on the keck ii telescope",
    ". we will use the rest - frame optical spectrum to obtain a model independent measure of dust extinction , an estimate of the virial mass , and the star formation rate .",
    "spectra such as this one also provide the best method for determining the metal abundance in lbgs .",
    "we will examine the evolutionary status of cb58 , and its implications as a `` typical '' lbg .",
    "we have chosen the brightest lbg as our first target ( ms1512-cb58 ; see yee et al .",
    "ms1512-cb58 is a gravitationally lensed starburst galaxy at z=2.72 .",
    "it was discovered serendipitously , within the field of the z=0.37 galaxy cluster ms1512 + 36 , in spectra obtained for the cnoc survey ( yee , ellingson , & carlberg 1996 ) .",
    "ms1512-cb58 is clearly extended with the morphology of a lensed arc ( williams & lewis , 1997 ; seitz et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "it has an ultraviolet spectrum representative of lbgs but due to a factor of @xmath8  magnification ( seitz et al .",
    "1998 ) it is orders of magnitude brighter than any other object of its kind ( v=20.6 , = 17.8 ; ellingson et al .",
    "1996 , hereafter e96 ) . like most lbgs ,",
    "its uv spectrum ( devoid of strong , high ionization emission lines ) rules out any non - stellar ( agn ) contribution to its flux .",
    "its apparent ( lensed ) star - formation rate is 2417  ( 0 = 75 km s@xmath9mpc@xmath9 , 0 = 0.1 ; with extinction correction ) from the 1500  continuum ( pettini et al .",
    "2000 , hereafter p2000 ) . throughout this paper , unless otherwise noted , a cosmology of ( 0 = 75 km s@xmath9mpc@xmath9 , 0 = 0.1 , @xmath5 ) is assumed .",
    "near ir spectra were obtained using the nirspec instrument on the 10-m w. m. keck ii telescope ( mclean et al .",
    "1998 , 2000a ) .",
    "spectra were obtained in the low resolution , long - slit mode , using a slitwidth of 3 pixels ( 0.57 ) at the ( insb ) detector .",
    "observations were made in the h and k bands , as well as the wavelength range between j and h ( 1.3 - 1.6 ; hereafter n4 for the custom nirspec-4 filter ) the seeing was 0.4 , 0.4 , 0.6  for n4 , h , k respectively .",
    "ms1512-cb58 is highly elongated with a major axis @xmath10  long , but a minor axis only a few tenths of an arcsecond wide .",
    "the slit was aligned with the long axis , while the unresolved ( seeing broadened ) width filled the slit .",
    "h - band spectra were obtained in 300 second exposures separated by @xmath11  nodding along the slit ; n4-band and k - band spectra were taken in 600 second integrations .",
    "total integration times were 1200 , 1800 , and 1800 seconds in n4 , h , and k respectively .",
    "the data reduction procedure followed the steps outlined in mclean et al .",
    "( 2000b ) .",
    "wavelength calibration was good to 0.99 .",
    "the output pixel scale was 4.16 / pixel in h and k , and 2.08 / pix in n4 .",
    "unresolved argon arc - lamp lines had fwhm@xmath12 , for a final resolution of , for example , r@xmath13  at 1.8 .",
    "nodded frames were registered , and the final 1d spectrum was extracted using a gaussian optimal extraction filter .",
    "extracted spectra were divided by the atmospheric absorption spectrum .",
    "we obtained this spectrum from similarly - reduced observation of a mostly featureless star ( hr5569 , an a2v for the k - band ; ppm130690 , a g star for the h - band ; and hr5630 , an f8v star for the n4-band ) , divided by a kurucz ( 1993 ) model atmosphere .",
    "emission - line equivalent widths ( ew ) were measured using gaussian fits to the line after subtraction of a local continuum .",
    "the flux of the line is then the ew multiplied by the continuum flux density , which is well known from broad - band photometry ( e96 ) .",
    "ms1512-cb58 is a homogenous ( featureless ) lensed image of the highest surface brightness part of the source galaxy ( seitz et al .",
    "1998 ) ; as such , our measurements of the ew can scale directly to the photometry , since light lost outside the slit is just a pure fraction of the total light .",
    "no real features fall outside the slit , as might be expected for an unlensed galaxy .",
    "figures 1 - 3 show the complete 1.28 - 1.53 , 1.551.97  and 2.05 - 2.46  spectra of ms1512-cb58 .",
    "just as lbg spectra in the rest - frame uv are remarkably similar to nearby starbursts , so too the optical spectrum of ms1512-cb58 is very similar to local irregulars or late type spirals .",
    "table [ tab : fluxes ]  lists the wavelengths and fluxes of the measured emission lines .",
    "the mean redshift calculated from the emission lines is @xmath14 , in contrast to the @xmath15  reported in yee et al .",
    "( 1996 ) from the rest - frame uv interstellar absorption lines .",
    "p98 find that velocity shifts on the order of several hundred km s@xmath9  between interstellar absorption lines and h  ii",
    "emission lines are typical in lbgs .",
    "p2000 confirm that this shift is seen in ms1512-cb58 as well , finding @xmath16  in good agreement with our result .",
    "since the measurement of the systemic redshift of ms1512-cb58 has only recently been available , several observations have been made in recent years assuming @xmath17  ( e.g. bechtold et al .",
    "1997 ; frayer et al .",
    "1997;.nakanishi et al .",
    "1997 ) . in most cases the observations are still valid despite the shift .",
    "p2000 find evidence in the uv spectrum for intervening absorption systems at z=0.829 and z=1.339 .",
    "the optical spectrum shows no emission features associated with those systems .",
    "however , the absorbing galaxy might be several arcseconds away from ms1512-cb58 , and so might not have fallen in the slit .",
    "the extinction correction due to dust is crucial to understanding the star formation activity occurring in the object .",
    "e96 infer = 0.3 from broad band photometry compared to synthetic galaxy spectra , and the lmc extinction curve of fitzpatrick ( 1986 ) .",
    "the best extinction correction for ms1512-cb58 derived from the ultraviolet continuum ( p2000 ) yields = 0.24 , assuming the same extinction law ; or = 0.29 for the calzetti ( 1994 ) reddening law . both of these measurements , however , are dependent on the slope of the model continuum .",
    "we measure : = @xmath18  ( note that the  line is measured with @xmath19 ) .",
    "it is assumed that the underlying stellar absorption of the balmer lines is small , and of equal magnitude for both lines ( olofsson 1995 ) .",
    "assuming case b recombination for h i at t=10000 k and @xmath20(@xmath21)@xmath22 , the intrinsic :  ratio is 2.86 ( osterbrock 1989 ) , implying @xmath23  using the calzetti law ( and very little change using the lmc law ) .",
    "we measure : @xmath24 , compared to an expected ratio of 0.45 .",
    "the strong emission lines allow us to measure the velocity dispersion .",
    "fitting gaussian profiles to ( e.g. )  we can measure @xmath25fwhm/2.355 .",
    "the width must then be corrected for the instrumental resolution .",
    "we find @xmath26  and @xmath27  ( observed ) .",
    "thus , in the rest frame , @xmath28 km s@xmath9 .",
    "seitz et al . ( 1998 ) find a half - light radius @xmath29kpc . from these values ,",
    "we obtain a virial mass @xmath6 . as expected , this value is in good agreement with the masses of lbgs at @xmath30 ( p98 ) .",
    "kobulnicky et al .",
    "( 1999 ; hereafter kkp99 ) give a prescription for determining chemical abundance estimates from the integrated spectra of high redshift galaxies .",
    "the best estimates are obtained for those spectra that detect @xmath31 , which directly measures the electron temperature of the ionized gas .",
    "we do not detect this line in our spectrum , with a limiting flux of @xmath32erg @xmath33s@xmath9  ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "reasonable ( 0.2dex ) estimates are obtained in the absence of that line if the @xmath35 , , and @xmath36  lines can be measured , and we proceed with that limitation from the outset .",
    "we calculate extinction corrected ratios of /@xmath37  and @xmath35/@xmath38 .",
    "we then calculate the quantity @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath40  has a direct relationship to the the oxygen abundance ( pagel et al . 1979 ) . in the case of ms1512-cb58 , @xmath41 . using the empirical calibration of zaritsky et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , where @xmath42 , @xmath43 or @xmath44 .",
    "however , the relationship between @xmath40  and oxygen abundance can be double - valued in this low metallicity regime ( mcgaugh 1991 ) .",
    "so , following kkp99 , we use the relationship between the @xmath35/@xmath45=@xmath46  and the oxygen abundance to confirm that the inferred oxygen abundance is reasonable ( edmunds & pagel 1984 ) .",
    "the solar value of @xmath47  is 8.89 , and thus cb58 has a metallicity 0.32 solar , which is broadly consistent with the @xmath48  found by p2000 .",
    "frayer et al . (",
    "1997 ) find a similar result , @xmath49 , based on the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and extinction .",
    "the emission line ratios also yield the nitrogen abundance in ms1512-cb58 . the n / o ratio",
    "is typically assumed to be equal to the n@xmath50/o@xmath50  ratio . using our estimates above",
    ", we can calculate n / o if we assume an electron temperature that is consistent with the oxygen abundance . using kkp99 s figure 5 , we find @xmath51  k , and then from vila - costas & edmunds ( 1993 ; hereafter vce ) , we infer @xmath52  k from their table 1 , and @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",
    "thus we find @xmath55 .",
    "this value of the nitrogen abundance is well below the solar value , consistent with the metallicity inferred from the oxygen abundance .",
    "however , the nitrogen abundance is still higher than might be expected for a galaxy as young as ms1512-cb58 has been predicted to be .",
    "the oxygen : nitrogen abundance ratio is most consistent with local ( @xmath56gyr old ) scd galaxies ( vce ) , though within the observed range of local , possibly younger , irregulars .",
    "further , the relatively high nitrogen abundance suggests that an older population of stars is necessary to produce it .",
    "the ratio @xmath57  suggests the presence of a secondary phase of nitrogen production , from intermediate mass stars ( kobulnicky & zaritsky 1999 ) .",
    "this result is in conflict with spectral synthesis modeling by e96 which showed that the sed of ms1512-cb58 can be explained without a population of stars older than 1 gyr .",
    "however , e96 only rule out an older population at the 2@xmath58  confidence level , so we conclude the older population of stars is likely .",
    "p2000 infer an observed ( without correcting for the lensing magnification factor of 30 ) sfr=2417",
    "@xmath59  ( 0 = 0.1 ) in ms1512-cb58 from the 1500  continuum .",
    "this estimate included a factor of 7 correction for dust extinction ( from an assumed = 0.24 ) .",
    "kennicutt ( 1983 ) relates the sfr to  luminosity , assuming a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) with an upper mass cutoff of 100m@xmath60 , by : @xmath61 .",
    "kennicutt assumed 1.1 magnitude attenuation between  and radio fluxes , similar to that implied by our extinction measurement .",
    "we neglect stellar absorption of , which is likely to be only 1 - 5  ew . we thus infer an ( observed , lensing magnified ) sfr=620@xmath62  @xmath59  ( 0=0.1 ) .",
    "this rate is a factor of 2.18 higher than that measured by bechtold et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , using narrow - band imaging .",
    "this difference is the result of an atmospheric absorption trough at the wavelength of redshifted , that obscures approximately half the light .",
    "this absorption was not accounted for by bechtold et al . , who assumed z=2.7233 rather than z=2.729 for  ( fortunately , their filter was wide enough to still detect the line ) .",
    "while we measure a higher sfr from  than bechtold et al . , we do not resolve the question of the discrepancy with the rate inferred from the uv continuum , a factor of 3.9 higher .",
    "this discrepancy may be seen in the calculation of sfrs for local starbursts as well .",
    "meurer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) find uv fluxes 10 times the value predicted by leitherer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) given measured ; recall that similar models of leitherer et al .",
    "( 1999 ; the updated _",
    "starburst99 _ ) were also used to calculate the sfr in ms1512-cb58 .",
    "bechtold et al .",
    "speculate that a number of unlikely possibilities could logically account for the difference .",
    "we find no compelling resolution to the problem in the optical spectrum .    for vigorously star - forming galaxies with moderate to solar metallicity , the co emission from the gas reservoir should be observable with existing ground based radio telescopes .",
    "however , two attempts to measure the co(3 - 2 ) line in ms1512-cb58 have yielded only upper limits ( frayer et al .",
    "1997 , nakanishi et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the lack of detectable co emission in ms1512-cb58 may be the result of either a high co - h@xmath63  conversion factor , or highly efficient formation of stars from the neutral hydrogen gas .",
    "frayer et al .",
    "suggest the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) of ms1512-cb58 is a factor of 20 larger than in local starbursts .",
    "however , following the arguments in frayer et al .",
    ", if we take our measurement of metallicity , @xmath64 , and of sfr=620 , we would find only a factor of 1.7 increase in the sfe .",
    "our assumptions would not address the high @xmath65  ratio .",
    "we can , however , bring the @xmath66@xmath67  ratio closer to the local values ( following nakanishi et al . ) .",
    "while it is difficult to draw general conclusions from observations of one object , the rest - frame optical spectrum of ms1512-cb58 affords us a preview of near - ir spectroscopy of lbgs . as expected ( seitz et al .",
    "1998 , p2000 ) , cb58 does not appear to be a `` proto - galaxy '' , but a galaxy with significant metals produced in at least two phases .",
    "we find that the properties of ms1512-cb58 are consistent with the interpretation of lbgs as progenitors of modern - day elliptical galaxies .",
    "previous studies have also shown that the mass , sfr , and extinction of lbgs are appropriate in that context ( i.e. p98 ) .",
    "we have obtained the first measure of metal abundance in an lbg from the promising @xmath40  method .",
    "the metallicity of @xmath68  solar is in the range expected at this redshift from hierarchical models of elliptical galaxy evolution ( thomas 1999 ) .",
    "ellipticals produce most of their stars , and hence metals , in the first @xmath69  or 1 gyr ( rocca - volmerange & fioc , 2000 ) , and so at @xmath30  they do not resemble low redshift , extremely metal poor galaxies , but rather older low - z starbursts .",
    "future lbg surveys with nirspec will explore this connection ( pettini et al .",
    "the ease with which our spectra were obtained ( 1.3 hours of telescope time ) demonstrates the great potential for observation of typical ( @xmath70 ) lbgs with nirspec or similar instruments .",
    "it is a pleasure to acknowledge the hard work of past and present members of the nirspec instrument team at ucla : maryanne angliongto , oddvar bendiksen , george brims , leah buchholz , john canfield , kim chin , jonah hare , fred lacayanga , samuel b. larson , tim liu , nick magnone , gunnar skulason , michael specncer , jason weiss and woon wong .",
