    "one of the most important quantities we derive for both individual galaxies and for populations used in studies of galaxy evolution is the star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "historically , we have relied on two principle diagnostics : the uv emission of young stars , and the ir emission of starlight - heated dust .",
    "the principal drawback of the uv approach is the strong extinction dependence , which can be somewhat corrected , for example , by using the uv slope @xcite .",
    "this relation is different for non - starbursting vs. starbursting galaxies potentially due to the influence of older stellar populations @xcite , as well as differences in extinction laws @xcite .",
    "the relation often fails for ir - selected starbursts @xcite , including sub - mm galaxies ( smgs ) and dusty red galaxies ( drgs ) ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the ir approach s principle drawback is sed variations which can affect bolometric vs. monochromatic estimates , as well as dust heating by older stellar populations .",
    "this is believed to be especially significant for pah emission ( e.g. broadband 8@xmath0 m ) and long wavelength cold dust emission , but less of an issue for the warm dust dominating the mid - ir continuum ( e.g. broadband 24@xmath0 m ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "ir - based relations may also underestimate the sfr if a significant fraction of the starlight is unobscured by dust , although this is partially mitigated by the conversion factors .",
    "more fundamentally , the conversion relations we use are ultimately calibrated on stellar population synthesis models and nearby populations of both normal and starburst galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) typically using total galaxy values .",
    "this effectively averages highly obscured with unobscured regions and could lead to underestimating the dust content in high redshift interacting galaxies @xcite . in order to further understand the limitations of these estimates",
    ", we would like to see how well these relations hold - up on smaller galactic scales , as was done in the case of m51 by @xcite .",
    "by @xmath6@xmath11 , the star - formation rate density is believed to be dominated by luminous infrared galaxies or lirgs , @xcite .",
    "recent work suggests that in such galaxies star - formation activity is likely to be largely triggered by mergers and tidal interactions @xcite .",
    "therefore , we are particularly interested to test how different sfr tracers and broadband obscuration diagnostics behave in galaxies undergoing such interactions .",
    "moreover , an investigation of the localized sfr in such galaxies can give us insight into the details of how interactions trigger star - formation .",
    "the nearby peculiar spiral galaxy ngc 2442 provides such an opportunity .",
    "it appears tidally distorted with areas of high star formation rate in the asymmetric spiral arms and nuclear region .",
    "the tidal distortion is thought to be the result of either ram - pressure stripping from interaction with an inhomogeneous igm @xcite or a tidal interaction with a neighboring galaxy @xcite . at a distance of 20.7mpc ( @xmath6=0.004890 , ned ) ,",
    "ngc 2442 is significantly closer to us than , for example , the bulk of the members of the arp atlas of peculiar galaxies @xcite3@xmath7 and hence are biased to the more nearby members of the arp catalog .",

    "the areas of highest sfr intensity in decreasing order are the spiral knots , the nuclear region , and the spiral arms .",
    "our sfr and sfr intensity estimates both globally and per region are presented in ( see table[table_masks3 ] ) .",
    "we compare the dust corrected - sfr(fuv ) , sfr(8 ) , @xmath59 , and sfr(fuv+24 ) values for the total galaxy and regions of interest in figure [ fig_sfr_compare ] , where @xmath62 has been calculated for only the total galaxy region and plotted with the smaller symbol .    only the north spiral arm and",
    "the spiral knots show agreement between all sfr indicators within 1@xmath37 .",
    "in particular , this suggests that the starburst - calibrated dust correction in the fuv is applicable for these regions ( we return to this point in section4.5 ) .",
    "a significant outlier here is the superbubble region , which we speculate is due to the presence of a very recent starburst in that region .",
    "as expected , the sfr(8 ) and sfr(24 ) show the best agreement .",
    "although it is surprising that this good agreement ( even for the total galaxy ) is not for the sfr(8 ) and sfr(24)@xmath57 values which are calibrated on the same sample and in the same method @xcite .",
    "this may indicate that the influence of hii regions in our galaxy is somewhat stronger than average in the @xcite sample .",
    "the one somewhat outlying point is for the tidal region  in the sense that it is deficient in 8@xmath0 m  emission compared to its 24@xmath0 m  emission relative to the average for the galaxy .",
    "we already discussed that this region has somewhat anomalous pah ratios in section4.1 .",
    "the tidal region and the superbubble region are the only ones where the sfr(8 ) and sfr(24)@xmath57 values are closer than sfr(8 ) and sfr(24)@xmath63 .",
    "it is important to note that the error bars shown in figure[fig_sfr_compare ] for the sfr(fuv ) show the uncertainty in the dust correction ; as apparent in table[table_masks3 ] , the uncertainty in the overall sfr(fuv ) relation is much larger .",
    "correcting the fuv emission for dust extinction introduces larger uncertainties for sfr(fuv ) than for sfr(8 ) and sfr(24 ) that are only surpassed by the large intrinsic spread of 0.3dex in sfr(fuv ) relations described by @xcite .",
    "a possible systematic uncertainty comes from using a dust obscuration correction calibrated for starburst galaxies , such as the uv - slope , which would overestimate the dustiness and l(fuv ) for a normal star - forming galaxy ( for a discussion of this problem see * ? ? ?",
    "for the uncertainty in sfr(8 ) , we emply two additional sfr(8 ) relations , those of @xcite and @xcite , and use half the spread in the three relations for each region of interest to define the uncertainty .",
    "we use the same method to estimate the uncertainty in sfr(24 ) , but employing a larger range of relations , including those of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , a linear sfr relation given in @xcite and derived in @xcite , and that of @xcite .",
    "the relations given by @xcite and @xcite are calibrated using starbursts , however we do not find a very large discrepancy between these different sfr(24 ) indicators .",
    "the largest discrepancy is actually introduced by the linear relation in @xcite .",
    "for the ease of subsequent analysis we also derive the global sfr for ngc2442 based on two well established sfr indicators : h@xmath4 and the total infrared emission , @xmath64 .",
    "the only previously published estimate of the sfr in ngc 2442 was based on its h@xmath4 emission @xcite .",
    "updating their value to account for the different cosmology we adopt as well as to the sfr relation in @xcite , we find sfr(h@xmath4)=4.2@xmath65 for the whole galaxy . ngc2442 has constraints at longer wavelength ( far - ir emission ) based on iras observations ( at 60 and 100@xmath0 m ) and mips 160@xmath0 m  observations . in order to accurately estimate the total @xmath66",
    ", we can use the contraints at longer wavelengths to choose a generic galaxy template , such as for an sc galaxy , that fits the data and integrate the luminosity in a defined range .",
    "we calculate the integrated @xmath67@xmath68@xmath69 , giving us @xmath70=10.53 and sfr(fir)=5.85@xmath2/yr , based on @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite derived global composite @xmath71 and infrared sfr relations for the sings galaxies . , which as discussed before are similar to ngc2442 in luminosity and hence these relations are applicable in our case .",
    "@xcite derive relations based both on the 24@xmath0 m  emission and total ir ( where tir is defined as @xmath72 ) . based on these sings - calibrated relations , we obtain sfr(h@xmath73 + 24)=6.1@xmath2/yr and sfr(h@xmath73+tir)=7.1@xmath2/yr .",
    "these are very similar to our total galaxy sfr(fuv+24 ) and sfr(24)@xmath63 respectively .",
    "combined , these relations account for both direct / unobscured young stellar light , the hii regions associated with ongoing sf and the total dust - reprocessed largely young stellar light .",
    "this leads us to believe that the true sfr is likely in the range @xmath167@xmath2/yr .      in the previous section",
    ", we showed that using the @xcite relation to translate the observed uv slope to the uv extinction leads to larger sfrs than obtained from the ir - based relations .",
    "this is assuming the @xcite relation for sfr(fuv ) and the discrepancy is even larger if the @xcite relation is used ( which gives sfr(fuv ) that are @xmath130% larger ) .",
    "as discussed previously , the systematic uncertainty in sfr(uv ) is quite significant , but for the purposes of this section it is ignored .    in section[sec_global ]",
    ", we argued that the true sfr is likely to lie in the range @xmath167@xmath2/yr . without dust correction our sfr(fuv ) for the total galaxy is 1.7 implying @xmath74=1.41.5 .",
    "the @xcite relation gives us @xmath74=2.0 .",
    "we use the generic @xmath75 vs. @xmath39 relation given in equation[eq_beta_gen ] , to constrain the uv - slope of the extinction curve that would reconcile the uv and ir - based sfr estimates . @xcite",
    "already discuss that , for star - forming galaxies , the range in the dust - free uv slope , @xmath44 , is relatively small ( -2.6 to -2.0 ) and adopt the value of @xmath44=-2.23 .",
    "we adopt the same intrinsic slope . in order to derive the @xmath45 ratio for different extinction curves , we convolve any given curve with the _ galex _ fuv and nuv filters .",
    "we find that , for a typical mw extinction curve , the additional absorption in the nuv band due to the 2200  absorption feature leads to even larger dust - corrected uv - based sfr estimates , making such relatively ` flat ' extinction curves unlikely .",
    "we then concentrate on ` feature - free ' and relatively steep extinction curves .",
    "the best known such extinction law is the one observed in the smc @xcite . in figure[fig_ext ] , we show the smc extinction law , the calzetti starburst extinction law @xcite and the mw @xmath76=3.1 extinction law @xcite compared with the _ galex _ filters .",
    "we find that reconciling the global 24@xmath0 m  sfr with the uv sfr requires an extinction law that lies in between the two curves .",
    "this can be described as a simple linear combination : c@xmath77=0.81c@xmath78 + 0.19c@xmath79 or c@xmath77=0.61c@xmath80 + 0.39c@xmath79 , where the latter largely reflects the influence of the 2000  feature .",
    "we can also compare this with the modified @xmath74 relations found by @xcite , who find that for their large sample of local uv - detected galaxies , the @xcite relation ( being specifically geared toward starbusts ) generally overestimates @xmath74 . using the @xcite relation ,",
    "we find @xmath74=1.42 , which would make the dust - corrected sfr(fuv ) much more consistent with our best estimate of the true sfr .",
    "we repeat this exercise on a region - by - region basis to potentially look for changes in the extinction curve across the galaxy .",
    "table[table_masks2 ] shows the values for @xmath75 we derived following both @xcite and @xcite , as well the @xmath75 required to match the sfr(24)@xmath63 .",
    "we chose sfr(24)@xmath63 as it gives the largest values ( compared with sfr(24)@xmath57 and sfr(fuv+24 ) ) and therefore in most cases is the closest to sfr(fuv)@xmath81 .",
    "we discuss different choices below .",
    "we find that , as for the total galaxy , the @xcite relation for @xmath75 leads to closer agreement between sfr(fuv ) and sfr(24 ) for most regions .",
    "considering the typical scatter of the @xmath75 relation in @xcite , we consider the match good for both spiral arms , as well as for the tidal and nuclear regions .",
    "therefore their extinction curves are probably not too dissimilar to that shown in figure[fig_ext ] .",
    "the cases where there is significant deviation are the diffuse region , superbubble and spiral knots . in both the case of the diffuse region and the superbubble",
    ", the uv slope suggests far more reddening than needed to reconcile sfr(fuv ) and sfr(24 ) . in this case",
    ", choosing sfr(24)@xmath57 leads to even worse agreement , and choosing sfr(fuv+24 ) makes little difference .",
    "considering the full spread of the sfr(fuv ) uncertainty ( which is dominated by the systematic uncertainty on the imf and star - formation history ) , if we go to the upper limits of sfr(fuv ) for these two regions , the discrepancy will be even larger .",
    "however the lower limits on sfr(fuv ) could bring the dust corrected sfr(fuv ) in agreement with sfr(24 ) . as discussed previously ,",
    "this may arise as a result of a significant , recent starburst ( as can be seen in the h@xmath4 emission in the superbubble ) .",
    "a steeper extinction curve would also help reconcile the two sfr estimates .",
    "however , we find that for example , to obtain the @xmath82 for the superbubble , we would need an unrealistic extinction curve that is much steeper than the smc .",
    "the influence of recent starburst activity is much more likely . on the other hand",
    "the spiral knots , are the only region where the @xcite relation for @xmath75 leads to better agreement between sfr(fuv ) and sfr(24 ) .",
    "therefore , an extinction curve closer to the @xcite starburst extinction is very likely .",
    "this is also not surprising given that this region has the strongest sfr intensity in this galaxy .",
    "the two are brought into even better alignment if the sfr(fuv+24 ) is considered instead of sfr(24)@xmath63 .",
    "the irx-@xmath39 relation compares l(tir)/l(fuv ) and @xmath39 , but since we do not have the total ir luminosity for the regions of interest in ngc 2442 , we use l(24)/l(fuv ) and @xmath39 .",
    "this modified irx-@xmath39 diagram is shown in figure [ fig_meurer ] , showing the average for each region of interest , as well as for the total galaxy .",
    "we find slightly different averages for the regions of interest when we calculate l(24)/l(fuv ) and @xmath39 using the total flux for each region versus when we calculate the per - pixel values and average them for each region .",
    "the representative error - bar shown in figure[fig_meurer ] is the 1@xmath37 spread in per - pixel values around the mean , not the error in the mean , which is much smaller given the large number of pixels in most regions .",
    "this plot also show the relation for starbursts from @xcite and that for normal spirals from @xcite .",
    "to convert between l(tir ) and l(24 ) we use the method of section [ sect_sfrfir ] to compute the ratio of l(tir)/l(24 ) .",
    "the l(tir ) of @xcite is defined between 3 - 850@xmath0 m and we estimate l(tir)/l(24)@xmath111.37 .",
    "the l(tir ) of @xcite is defined between 1 - 1000@xmath0 m and we estimate a larger ratio of l(tir)/l(24)@xmath121.39 . the data for sings spiral galaxies from @xcite have been included to show the range of l(24)/l(fuv ) versus @xmath39 values for a normal star - forming population .",
    "we find that our spiral knots alone are in good agreement with the starburst relation , while the rest of the regions and the total galaxy as a whole are in good agreement with the normal galaxies relation .",
    "@xcite argue that this spread between the normal star - forming galaxies and starbursts can be explained by differences in the extinction curve .",
    "therefore our spiral knots being closer to the starburst relation and likely having an extinction law comparable to calzetti et al .",
    "( see previous section ) is consistent with this conclusion .",
    "however , we should keep in mind that in the previous section we assumed a constant @xmath44 ( i.e. dust - free uv slope ) .",
    "variations in @xmath44 , such as with higher contributions of older stars would affect this as well .",
    "however , with the inferred sfrs and intensities of this region , there should be plenty of young stars to dominate the uv emission .",
    "one of the principle questions we address in this paper is the global sfr and obscuration of ngc2442 .",
    "the only previous measurement of the sfr in ngc 2442 was presented in @xcite , who find 4.9@xmath2/yr globally .",
    "this already has dust correction of @xmath83=0.45 applied to it .",
    "the foreground extinction value is @xmath83=0.54 ( ned ) . using the @xmath71 luminosity as given in @xcite ) , and updating the luminosity distance and sfr relation @xcite , as well as the difference in foreground extinction values , we find sfr(h@xmath4)=4.6@xmath65 . using uv , 8@xmath0 m , 24@xmath0 m , and composite ( uv+24 ) estimates ,",
    "we find values of 611@xmath2/yr the latter being the uv - based estimate when corrected for dust using the meurer relation .",
    "we conclude that the true sfr is most likely to lie in the range @xmath167@xmath2/yr based on a wide range of relations including a hii region - calibrated sfr(24 ) and integrated total galaxy light and tir - calibrated sfr(24 ) , as well as composite ( h@xmath4 + 24 , h@xmath4+tir , and fuv+24 ) relations .",
    "this also agrees with the sfr(fuv ) if we adopt the @xcite relations for both sfr(fuv ) and @xmath74 .",
    "all of these relations are calibrated using nearby normal star - forming galaxies , and are therefore applicable to ngc2442 .",
    "this global agreement between the ir - based and uv - based sfr estimates for ngc2442 , requires a steeper uv extinction law ",
    "one in between the smc and starburst ( calzetti ) extinction curves , or between a mw - type and a smc - type extinction .",
    "however , we do find that the areas of highest sfr intensity are consistent with the starburst extinction law , which may provide a hint for the range of applicability of different extinction laws .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested that a steeper uv extinction might be required for at least some high redshift lyman - break galaxies as well , which highlights the need to understand this uncertainty better locally .",
    "we find that the sfr in ngc2442 most likely lies in the range @xmath167@xmath2/yr , which is @xmath11535@xmath84 higher than the value of sfr(h@xmath4 ) alone . in order for the h@xmath4 emission to give the same value of sfr as the 24@xmath0 m it would have to be obscured by @xmath85magnitudes globally .",
    "the inferred uv obscuration value is @xmath75=2.0 ( based on the meurer relation ) or @xmath75=1.5 ( required to make the uv and 24@xmath0 m  sfr estimates agree ) .",
    "based on the @xcite @xmath76=3.1 mw extinction curve , we find @xmath86/@xmath75=0.30 , implying @xmath86=0.40.6 . if we adopt the theoretical smc extinction curve from @xcite , we find @xmath86/@xmath75=0.14 implying @xmath86@xmath10.20.3 .",
    "an h@xmath4 extinction of @xmath87 required to reconcile our h@xmath4 sfr with our ir - based estimates is apparently in between these two values .",
    "however , if we consider differential attenuation between the stellar continuum and the ionized gas , we have @xmath88@xmath12.2a@xmath89 @xcite , implying that uv / optical extinction curve in ngc2442 may be closer to the smc after all .",
    "note however that the uncertainties on all of these estimates are substantial and even more fundamentally that we have assumed a very simplistic geometry , in that everything is treated as a homogeneous dust screen .",
    "another aspect of this work was to address the spatial distribution of star - formation and obscuration in ngc2442 especially in light of its tidally distorted morphology . the ir emission ( both 8@xmath0 m  and 24@xmath0 m ) is fairly clumpy and largely concentrated along the spiral arms , with the notable exception of the superbubble region . the uv emission does not correlate well with the ir emission in that there is relatively stronger fuv emission outside the spiral arms . the superbubble region and the tidal region at the tip of the southern arm are both particularly strong in the uv relative to the ir .",
    "we find that the highest sfr intensities are found in the 24@xmath0m - bright knots along the spiral arms , followed by the nuclear region which includes a circumnuclear ring .",
    "the nuclear region also has the highest levels of uv obscuration with @xmath75@xmath14 .",
    "the most unusual seds are observed for the superbubble region as well as the tidal region , which also has irac colors that deviate from the usual trend .",
    "the superbubble region in particular , is believed to be an area of strong past and current star - formation outside of the spiral arms .",
    "we can also compare the h@xmath4 image from @xcite with that of the other star formation tracers .",
    "@xcite find that there is little diffuse h@xmath4 emission , with a majority concentrated in hii regions .",
    "the most luminous 24@xmath0 m and 8@xmath0 m regions tend to overlap with the hii regions ( this can also be seen in figure[fig_ha_8um ] for part of the galaxy ) .",
    "figure[fig_co ] also shows a _ by eye _",
    "comparison of the @xmath90co ( 1 - 0 ) line intensity and velocity field as determined by @xcite with our mips24@xmath0 m  map of ngc2442 .",
    "most clearly , the co intensity exhibits two prominent peaks which correspond to the nucleus and the knots along the northern spiral arm .",
    "both region were identified above as having the highest sfr intensity .",
    "the star - forming knots along the southern spiral arm are somewhat weaker but do correspond to co - bright regions as well .",
    "our superbubble region also shows co emission as expected for an active star - forming region .",
    "lastly , what does this mean in terms of the history of ngc2442 ? it is still unclear whether ngc2442 has undergone a tidal encounter with a neighboring galaxy or has suffered ram pressure stripping . a large cloud of hydrogen , a third the mass of ngc2442 s neutral gas , resides just north of the galaxy , and may be a result of these violent processes @xcite .",
    "our best estimate for the total sfr in ngc2442 ( sfr@xmath167@xmath2/yr ) , is somewhat higher than typical in normal star - forming galaxies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting enhanced star - formation in addition to the morphological distortion ( contrary to * ? ? ?",
    "the star - formation is not overwhelmingly concentrated in the nuclear region , as expected in interacting galaxies @xcite , but is rather strong in clumps of intense star - formation along the spiral arms .",
    "these regions in themselves display many properties of starburst galaxies including a strong pah / stars ratio , and potentially a more starburst - like extinction law .",
    "the northern spiral arm is stronger and much more pronounced than its southern counterpart , and includes the clumps of highest star - formation rate intensity , coincident with high molecular gas concentrations ( figure[fig_co ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the southern part of the galaxy shows a weaker spiral arm which transitions into our ` tidal region ' , as well as the superbubble region outside the spiral arm , which we associate with active star - formation .",
    "this north - south asymmetry is rather convincingly explained by ram pressure stripping by @xcite where the morphology and star - formation strength of the northern arm is due to the bow shock where the galaxy plows into the intergalactic medium ( see also figure[fig_co ] ) .",
    "the area of our superbubble region is a strong radio emitter @xcite , in support of the role of supernovae in that region .",
    "while the above discussion generally supports the ram pressure stripping scenario , the details are not yet clear and further study is needed to truly explore the possibilities . in particular , we need to explore how common this type of galaxy might be at higher redshifts where we generally lack morphological information and where we expect typically denser environments .",
    "detailed dynamical modeling of ngc2442 would be especially useful for exploring ngc2442 s past and explaining the many interesting properties of this galaxy .",
    "the morphological and sed properties of the superbubble and tidal regions are unusual and unexpected on the basis of existing simulatations of ngc2442 @xcite .",
    "higher resolution radio observations of the superbubble region would help shed light on its nature ( in particular to see if the shell - like structure observed in the irac8@xmath0 m  image is visible there as well ) .",
    "a mid - ir spectrum of the tidal region would help us to better understand its peculiar irac colors .",
    "some caveats in our discussion need to be taken into account . while we were careful to use sfr relations that are applicable to our galaxy and to characterize the associated uncertainties , ultimately our conclusions regarding the sfr globally and per region are _ relative _ to the original samples on which these relations were calibrated as well as any underlying assumptions ( such as inherent in the h@xmath4-sfr conversion ) .",
    "in addition , this galaxy has substantial foreground extinction ( see section2.4 ) .",
    "we correct for this prior to any subsequent analysis , but how would our conclusions be affected by uncertainties in the level of this foreground ?",
    "ultimately , our best estimates of the star - formation in this galaxy arise from the infrared data and hence would be unchanged .",
    "the sfr(fuv ) estimates are strongly affected by dust obscuration and hence , in practice , we use them primarily as a way to constrain the extinction curve in ngc2442 .",
    "most simply put , a higher foreground would imply a more smc - like extinction curve , while a lower foreground would imply a more mw - type dust .",
    "it is difficult to address this further however , because of the large systematic uncertainties on sfr(fuv ) .",
    "ngc 2442 is a nearby galaxy whose peculiar morphology is believed to arise either from tidal interaction with a neighboring galaxy or ram pressure stripping which acts roughly south - to - north .",
    "the _ galex _ and _ spitzer _ data allow us to explore the distribution and levels of star formation and dust obscuration in this galaxy .",
    "our major regions of interest are the spiral arms , spiral knots of high 24@xmath0 m emission , nuclear region ( including a circumnuclear ring ) , the diffuse region , a tidally distorted region at the southern tip of the galaxy and a superbubble region inside the diffuse area .",
    "we employ various tracers of star formation : the fuv , 8@xmath0 m  and 24@xmath0 m  emission as well as a composite fuv+24 sfr relation . for the total sfr",
    ", we also consider the @xmath91 and total ir luminosities .",
    "the dust obscuration is traced using the uv - slope as well as by trying to reconcile the uv , h@xmath73 and 24@xmath0m - based sfr estimates .",

    "our best estimate for the total sfr of ngc2442 is @xmath167@xmath2/yr .",
    "this is based on the 24@xmath0 m  emission as well as a combination of fuv and 24@xmath0 m and h@xmath3 and total ir emission , as calibrated by @xcite .",
    "the highest intensity star - forming regions are the spiral knots followed by the nuclear region .",
    "the nuclear region is the most obscured region of the galaxy .",
    "it also includes a @xmath10.8kpc radius circum - nuclear ring that is especially prominent at 8@xmath0 m  ( i.e. pah emission ) .",
    "the nuclear h@xmath3 emission shows a vague extended spiral structure that is largely contained inside this pah ring .",
    "a tidal debris region has unusual irac colors , which is consistent with similar findings from @xcite .",
    "with only broad - band data , we can not say conclusively what is the cause for this , but it may be due to relatively higher levels of hot dust , or the presence of strong molecular or ionic emission lines , especially in the 5.8@xmath0 m  band .",
    "4 .   with standard uv - slope dust correction , the sfr(fuv ) values",
    "are consistently higher than the ir - based estimates .",
    "we find that , globally , we can reconcile the fuv and 24@xmath0 m  sfr estimates by a uv extinction law that is intermediate in slope between an smc - like extinction and a calzetti - like extinction .",
    "regions of high star - formation intensity , the spiral knots and the north spiral arm , are consistent with the starburst - calibrated calzetti extinction . a similar analysis to reconcile the h@xmath4 and uv - based sfrs suggests an optical / uv extinction slope intermediate between a mw - type and an smc - type extinction .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , the nucleus of ngc2442 is a liner . the optical spectra ( bajaja et al .",
    "1999 ) covering from @xmath135007000 , shows some of the classical emission lines including : h@xmath4 , h@xmath39 , [ oii ] 3727 , [ oiii ] 4959 + 5007 , [ nii]5755 + 6548 + 6584 , [ oi ] 6300 ( surprisngly not 6363 ) and [ sii ] 6717 + 6731 .",
    "the fact that there is a significant energy source exciting the gas can be seen in that , for example , the optical [ oiii ] 5007 is as bright as h@xmath39 .",
    "although , we found that the nuclear irac colors were not in themselves indicative of an agn , this is actually not surprising for liners .",
    "for example , fri radio galaxies often show no ir emission from their agn @xcite .",
    "there is an on - off mips sed observation of the nuclear region of ngc2442 .",
    "this observation was made feb 20 , 2004 ( on the same day as the irac chan4 image ) .",
    "the mips - sed fov is @xmath12.7@xmath300.34@xmath7 which covers the whole nuclear region ( including the 8@xmath0 m  ring ) , but it is also slightly contaminated by the edge of the spiral arm ( see figure[fig_nucleus_sed]_left _ ) . in figure[fig_nucleus_sed]_right",
    "_ , we show both the 2d and 1d mips sed , which is compared with the well known spectrum of m82 .",
    "the [ oi ] 63@xmath0 m  line that we can see in the low resolution sed spectrum appears to be offset from the nucleus itself as can be seen in the 2d spectrum .",
    "it appears that the continuum likely originates in the nucleus itself whereas the oxygen emission is more likely associated with the ring .",
    "it is interesting that the continuum is rising compared with m82 , which is rather ` warm ' for a starburst .",
    "as was already discussed in the context of the nucleus irac colors , this also suggests the lack of a hot agn - heated torus .",
    "the other interesting feature in the nuclear region is that in the irac images ( especially at 8@xmath0 m ) it can be separated into a compact nucleus and a ring of a radius of @xmath10.8kpc . in figure[fig_nucleus_ha ] , we compare the 8@xmath0 m  emission ( contours ) with an archival acs h@xmath4 image available through the mast _ hst _ archive . the conclusions that can be drawn from this comparison are : 1 ) the h@xmath4 emission is largely inside the 8@xmath0 m  ring meaning the latter can be interpreted as a higher obscuration / dustier region whose pah are excited by the stars inside the ring ; 2 ) the h@xmath4 and 8@xmath0 m  nuclei are slightly offset from each other , which could be due to obscuration , although some pointing offset can not be excluded ; and 3 ) the h@xmath4 nucleus is slightly resolved and there is a suggestion of spiral structure in the h@xmath4 image which type of structure has been seen in other star - forming galaxies , this supports the view that although an agn is likely present ( accounting for the liner spectrum ) , significant nuclear star - formation is also present .",
    "the strong ( and rising ) far - ir continuum seen in figure[fig_nucleus_sed]_right _ also supports this view ."

    "<S> we supplement these with archival data in the b , j , h , and k bands . </S>",
    "<S> we use the 8@xmath0 m , 24@xmath0 m  and fuv ( 1500 ) emission to study the star formation rate ( sfr ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that globally , these tracers of star formation give a range of results of @xmath1611@xmath2/yr , with the dust - corrected fuv giving the highest value of sfr . </S>",
    "<S> we can reconcile the uv and ir - based estimates by adopting a steeper uv extinction curve that lies in between the starburst ( calzetti ) and smc extinction curves . </S>",
    "<S> however , the regions of highest sfr intensity along the spiral arms are consistent with a starburst - like extinction . </S>",
    "<S> overall , the level of star - formation we find is higher than previously published for this galaxy , by about a factor of two , which , contrary to previous conclusions , implies that the interaction that caused the distorted morphology of ngc2442 likely also triggered increased levels of star - formation activity . </S>",

    "<S> lastly , we discover an 8@xmath0 m  ( pah ) circumnuclear ring with an @xmath10.8kpc radius . </S>",
    "<S> the h@xmath4 emission is largely concentrated inside that ring and shows a vague spiral structure in the rest of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the nuclear region shows the highest obscuration levels in the galaxy ( a@xmath5@xmath134 ) most likely due to the circumnuclear dust ring . </S>"
