    "neutrino is probably one of the most enigmatic and at the same time the most wide - spread particles in the universe @xcite . due to its very weak interaction with matter ,",
    "a target would have to be light - years thick before efficiently stopping a neutrino . therefore ,",
    "direct investigation of the neutrino properties requires intensive neutrino source and low background detector with a sensitive volume of at least cubic metre scale .",
    "the most intensive laboratory neutrino source is provided by nuclear fission  for instance , a typical russian 3  gw@xmath2 industrial reactor wwer-1000 produces about @xmath24 antineutrinos per second . as the particle flux falls down very fast with distance ,",
    "it is desirable to install the detector as close to the reactor core as possible . on the other hand",
    ", security rules do not allow to use big amount of inflammable , caustic , toxic or other dangerous liquids in a reactor building .",
    "that is why conventional liquid scintillator ( ls ) becomes `` persona non grata '' at nuclear power plant ( npp ) , and detectors of other type are needed .",
    "if such detector exists ",
    "it could be efficiently used for many applied and fundamental goals based on the precise measurement of the neutrino energy spectrum : on - line monitoring of the reactor power , fuel composition , burning space pattern ( up to tomography ) , etc .",
    "if made movable , the detector would be probably the best suited for testing the hypothesis of short - range neutrino oscillation to a sterile state  @xcite .",
    "the aim of the * danss * ( * d*etector of * a*nti*n*eutrino based on * s*olid * s*cintillator ) project  @xcite is to develop and create a relatively compact detector of the reactor antineutrinos which consists of highly segmented plastic scintillator with a total volume of 1 m@xmath0 , has appropriate signal - to - background ( s / b ) ratio and can be moved within few metres from the reactor core .",
    "being installed in any available room close to an industrial reactor , the detector could register about @xmath25 neutrinos per day and measure their energy spectrum .",
    "varying the core - detector distance in some range , detector could confirm or disprove `` sterile '' explanation of the reactor neutrino anomaly  @xcite within few weeks of data taking .",
    "one of the most appropriate sites in russia for our neutrino experiments is kalinin nuclear power plant ( knpp ) located between moscow and saint petersburg and exploiting four pressurized water reactors wwer-1000  @xcite .",
    "the first stage of knpp includes 30 years old reactor units # 1 and # 2 of so - called `` b-338 '' project , and the second stage  younger units # 3 and # 4 of the `` b-320 '' project .",
    "depending on the project , there are several potentially available places in the reactor building ( fig .  [ fig.wwer1000_building ] ) , but only few of them could provide appropriate conditions for an experimental setup . for the `` b-338 '' project , it was the a107 room located just under the reactor cauldron at 14 meters from the core .",
    "this site was used in our gemma experiment @xcite .",
    "the more recent `` b-320 '' project has an even better location : room a336 .",
    "in addition to extremely high neutrino flux ( @xmath26 at a distance of 11  m ) such location provides very good shielding ( @xmath2750  m of water equivalent ) against cosmic rays .    indeed ,",
    "in addition to numerous equipment , thick walls of heavy concrete and the reactor body with more than 70 tons of uranium , there are several huge reservoirs with technological liquids placed above the room  repository of the primary coolant and boric acid for the reactivity adjustment , as well as a cooling pond for the spent fuel .",
    "these hydrogen - containing materials completely remove fast cosmic neutrons which are the main source of background in such measurements ( see section  [ sect.danssino ] below ) .",
    "the muon component is suppressed by a factor of @xmath276 also .",
    "two similar rooms 3-a336 and 4-a336 located under the twin reactor units # 3 and # 4 have been considered as an experiment site .",
    "finally the latter one was chosen , because it provides enough space for big dimension equipment .",
    "gamma background in the center of the room is only twice higher than in an average laboratory building .",
    "a reason of the excess is big amount of heavy concrete in the surrounding walls .",
    "it contains natural @xmath28k which is radioactive and emits @xmath29-rays with @xmath30=1.461  mev .",
    "measurement performed with hpge detector ( fig .",

    "that is why some of the fuel rods are doped with gadolinium which captures neutrons and partially dumps the fuel burning . ] .",
    "it means that the direct @xmath29-rays from the core surely do not penetrate into the room through the reactor shielding .",
    "instead , the spectrum demonstrates several high energy lines corresponding to the neutron capture by cr , fe and ni nuclei which are contained in numerous steel construction elements .",

    "the most appropriate reaction which is generally used to detect reactor antineutrino was mentioned first by h.  bethe and r.  peierls more than 80 years ago  @xcite .",
    "it is inverse beta - decay ( ibd ) : @xmath49 in case the proton is not bound in a compound nucleus , the ibd cross - section can be expressed  @xcite as @xmath50 where neutron lifetime @xmath51 is given in seconds and @xmath52=1.293  mev .",
    "more precise formula includes some important corrections ( see , e.g. , @xcite or @xcite ) which could change slightly the absolute value of @xmath53 but not its general character .",
    "it is easily seen that energy threshold of the ibd reaction is @xmath54 and the detection efficiency depends very much on the neutrino energy .",
    "an absolute energy spectrum of antineutrino emitted by nuclear reactor is a subject of numerous theoretical and experimental investigations .",
    "unfortunately , it can not be extracted directly from experimentally measured overall cumulative @xmath55-spectrum emitted by the reactor fuel , but instead requires precise knowledge of intensities and spectra of _ each _ decay branch of _ each _ fission product _ separately_.",
    "this information is not available at the present time  only few tens @xmath55-transitions from several thousands have been ever measured with enough precision .",
    "so , the reactor neutrino spectrum could be evaluated merely as a result of very imprecise and model - dependent theoretical estimations started 35 years ago @xcite and continued up to now @xcite .",
    "additional uncertainty is caused by variation of the fuel composition within the reactor life - time : initial active @xmath56u isotope burns out intensively , whereas so - called `` weapon '' @xmath57pu is produced from a ballast @xmath58u which represents about 88% of the fuel mass.u . ]",
    "the spent fuel is kept in a coolant pond nearby the reactor for 34 years before evacuation and @xmath55-decay of its long - lived nuclei contributes to the neutrino spectrum as well , so that it depends on many factors such as reactor type and actual status , previous fuel history , construction of the reactor building , etc .    according to the work @xcite , typical russian reactor wwer1000 of the pwr type operating in the middle of the campaign undergoes @xmath59  fissions per second , emitting @xmath60  antineutrinos per fission .",
    "significant portion of these neutrinos can not be detected because of the reaction threshold ( [ eq.ibd_threshold ] ) , especially in case of inertial long - lived part of the fission products .",
    "indeed , as the beta - decay probability depends on the decay energy roughly as @xmath61 , only short - lived nuclei are those which can emit above - threshold neutrinos ( exception could be forbidden transitions or so - called `` generator pairs '' , but they are not numerous ) .",
    "it means that an ibd - based neutrino detector is useless for monitoring of the spent fuel or radioactive waste . on the other hand",
    ", it makes the detector even more sensitive to the fission process itself  to be exact , to numerous extremely short - lived fission products which reflect the reactor status .",
    "the ibd detection ( [ eq.ibd ] ) proceeds in two steps : the first one applies to the positron and the second to the neutron .",
    "after subtraction of the threshold value most of the remaining neutrino energy is transferred to the positron and only few kev to the neutron .",
    "the positron deposits its energy within a short range of few cm and then annihilates emitting two 511  kev photons at 180@xmath48 . as a result ,",
    "the first ( prompt ) energy deposit is distributed in space in a very specific way .",
    "the second ( delayed ) step is the detection of the neutron .",
    "after moderation in 1 - 3 cm of the plastic scintillator it is captured by @xmath62gd or @xmath63gd with a very high cross - section . in both cases a cascade of @xmath29-rays",
    "is emitted with the total energy of about 8  mev .",
    "because of high multiplicity and deep penetration in plastic these @xmath29-rays produce a flash which is spread widely within a sphere with a diameter of about 30 - 40  cm , so that a number of strips in several x and y modules are usually fired .",
    "distribution of time between the prompt and delayed signals is described by a combination of two exponents @xmath64 where the characteristic times @xmath65 and @xmath66 correspond to the neutron moderation and capture respectively and depend on the detector structure .",
