    "many of these latest discoveries are remarkably feeble , fainter than most known systems , rightfully earning the name of ` ultra - faint ' satellites .",
    "as more ultra - faint satellites ( ufs ) have being discovered , complications have arisen in trying to accurately classify them .",
    "a tenuous overlap between the effective radii and absolute magnitudes of faint globular clusters and ultra - faint dwarf galaxies has emerged .",
    "it is now crystal clear , the morphology of ultra - faint systems near the _ valley of ambiguity _ can not be classified from photometry alone @xcite .",
    "kinematics and chemistry are required to distinguish between these classifications . a large dispersion in overall",
    "metallicity is representative of extended star formation in a dwarf galaxy - like environment that is massive enough to retain supernova ejecta , providing a key diagnostic for distinguishing globular clusters and dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the ufss have been the focus of attention of galactic archaeologists world wide for less than a decade .",
    "worryingly , during this short history , many of their spectroscopically determined properties have continued to evolve .",
    "for example , the early studies of the botes  1 dwarf spheroidal reported a velocity dispersion as high as 6.5  km s@xmath11 @xcite",
    ". however , an independent and novel study by @xcite revealed that the dwarf s internal kinematics is potentially dominated by a stellar population with a velocity dispersion as low as 2.4 km s@xmath11 .",
    "similarly , for the segue  2 satellite , @xcite gave an estimate of 3.4  kms@xmath11 and a warning of a potential contamination from the surrounding tri - and stream .",
    "in fact , @xcite later showed the velocity of segue  2 is consistent with zero , thus ruling out the presence of any significant amount of dark matter in the system . undoubtedly , robust uncertainties on individual stellar velocity measurements are paramount to accurate characterization of the kinematics of these systems .",

    "more than 10@xmath15 milky way stars are homogeneously targeted as part of the gaia - eso survey , including all major structural components : open and globular clusters , the disk , bulge , and the halo .",
    "understanding the role of ultra - faint satellites is indeed important in this context , as they inform us of star formation in isolated environments as well as the accretion history of the galaxy .    here",

    "horologium  1 , also located towards the lmc , is more distant at 79kpc but given somewhat brighter luminosity of @xmath17 and a visible giant branch , spectroscopy of candidate red giant branch ( rgb ) stars is accessible from the vlt in a standard gaia - eso survey observing block . while our primary goal is to establish the true nature of these faint stellar systems by gauging the amount dark matter they might contain , we also intend to test the hypothesis that the dwarfs have once been part of the magellanic group .",

    "the velocity analysis has been performed using standard gaia - eso survey radial velocity ( rv ) pipeline .",
    "although the full details of this pipeline will be presented in @xcite , here we outline the principle components .",
    "the algorithm is based on a direct pixel - fitting procedure implemented by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and employs the phoenix library of model stellar spectra @xcite .",
    "all of the observed spectra are fitted ( using a @xmath21 metric ) by model templates that are interpolated from the spectral library , and the continuum is modelled by a high - degree polynomial .",
    "the maximum likelihood point is found by using nelder - mead algorithm @xcite , using several starting points to avoid being trapped in local maxima .",
    "the location of the maximum likelihood ( @xmath21 minimum ) and the hessian of the likelihood surface are used to provide the best - fit velocity , errors and estimates of the stellar atmospheric parameters .",
    "the crucial ingredient in correctly extracting the kinematics of ultra - faint satellites is a proper understanding of the uncertainties of rv measurements ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "because the gaia - eso survey has already observed many thousands of stars , some of them repeatedly and with different instrument configurations , our experience with the survey provide us with a very good understanding of the rv precision achievable .",
    "for this paper , however , we focus only on data in just two gaia - eso milky way fields : those with horologium  1 and reticulum  2 candidates .",
    "in addition to the standard data processing steps performed for the gaia - eso survey , there are three subtle points that are important for this study :    * _ spectral covariance . _",
    "the standard gaia - eso reduction pipeline rebins the spectra to a common wavelength mapping with a fixed step size .",
    "for hr10 the common wavelength scale extends from 5334 - 5611 and for hr21 the boundaries are 8475 - 8982 , both with a spacing of 0.05 . while convenient for some analyses , the rebinning procedure introduces correlated noise / covariance in the spectra and reduces the effective information content of the spectra .",
    "for example , the rebinned hr21 spectra has 10141 pixels , the rebinned hr10 spectra has 5541 pixels , while the original spectra are just 4096 pixels",
    ". we can account for this correlation by modelling the spectra with the full covariance matrix , or approximate it .",
    "our tests found that if we fit the spectra using the full covariance matrix of the data and the posterior / likelihood is properly behaved ( e.g. , uni - modal and close to a gaussian ) , then the effect of pixel covariance is equivalent to scaling the errors by a fixed constant : 1.5 for hr10 , 2.0 for hr21 .",
    "these numbers are approximately equal to the ratio of rebinned and original pixels .",
    "we adopt this scaling throughout the rest of our analysis .",
    "see the end of this section for the verification of the results . *",
    "_ systematic error floor .",
    "_ it is well - known that although the formal rv precision derived from cross - correlation or pixel - fitting methods can be almost arbitrarily small for sufficiently high s / n spectra , the actual precision achievable with most spectrographs is generally limited by systematic effects .",
    "this includes instrument flextures , uncertainties in the wavelength calibrations , line spread function ( lsf ) variation / asymmetry and template mismatches .",
    "this systematic component has to be included in the total error budget .",
    "we have found this systematic error to be around 300 m s@xmath11 from large numbers of gaia - eso milky way spectra .",
    "it is important to note that this systematic component is not expected to be present when comparing rvs obtained from spectra using the same setup in sequential exposures , but it becomes important when comparing rvs from different nights , or between hr10 and hr21 setups . we include this systematic error floor in suitable comparisons hereafter . * _ rv offset between hr10 and hr21 .",
    "_ over the course of the gaia - eso survey , it has been discovered that there is a small systematic offset of 400 m  s@xmath11 between the rvs measured in the hr10 and hr21 setups .",
    "the cause of this offset is not well - established yet .",
    "this correction was applied to the radial velocities ( the hr21 velocities have been shifted by @xmath22 m  s@xmath11 ) .    after applying the aforementioned corrections",
    ", we can confirm whether the rvs measured in repeated exposures match within the precision quoted by our error bars . to test this",
    "we have collated all the spectra in the ` ges_mw_033542_540254 ` and ` ges_mw_025532_540711 ` fields ( i.e. , including both standard gaia - eso targets and possible satellite member stars ) .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig : rvrepeat ] shows the distribution of velocity differences ( @xmath23 ) scaled by the rv error ( @xmath24 ) for repeated hr10 exposures .",
    "the middle panel of the figure shows the same for the hr21 setup .",
    "the bottom panel shows the distribution of normalised velocity differences for hr10 exposures versus hr21 .",
    "in all the panels the red curve shows a standard normal distribution with zero mean and unit variance . in all cases the distributions",

    "we found a first - order polynomial to sufficiently represent the continuum in each channel .",

    "for this reason we chose to include the spectral resolution @xmath37 as a nuisance parameter with reasonable priors and marginalise them away .",

    "after convolution with the lsf , binning to the observed pixels @xmath38 and assuming gaussian error @xmath41 , the probability distribution @xmath42 for the observed spectral flux @xmath43 is : @xmath44 ^ 2}{2\\sigma_{i}^{2}}\\right)}.\\ ] ]    under the implied assumption that the data are independently drawn , the likelihood of observing the data @xmath45 , given our model , is found by the product of individual probabilities :    @xmath46    and the probability @xmath47 of observing the data is proportional up to a constant such that :    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the prior probability on the model parameters @xmath50 .    in practice we found that the spectral range of our data were not particularly informative of the effective temperature @xmath3 for very metal - poor stars . for these stars the data were prone to favour unphysically cool super giant stars of extremely low metallicity .",
    "we did not find the same effect for more metal - rich stars , where there are sufficient neutral and ionising transitions present to accurately constrain the stellar parameters .",
    "given most of our candidates are indeed metal - poor , we found it prudent to fix the effective temperature using the des photometry and a colour - temperature relationr colors and effective temperature from segue @xcite . ] .",
    "we found this had no significant impact on our posteriors for the foreground dwarfs  where the spectra are indeed informative of effective temperature  and ultimately did not substantially alter our inferred metallicity dispersion for either satellite .",
    "only the mean satellite metallicities were affected .",
    "the uncertainties in effective temperature listed in table [ tbl2 ] were calculated by propagating the des photometric uncertainties with the intrinsic uncertainty in the colour - temperature relation .",
    "thus , our forward model is subject to our photometric temperatures and has only 10 parameters : @xmath4 , [ fe / h ] , [ @xmath8/fe ] , @xmath32 , the resolving powers @xmath51 and @xmath52 , as well as two continuum coefficients in each channel .",
    "the initial model parameters @xmath32 and @xmath53 ( modulo @xmath3 ) were estimated by performing a coarse normalisation of the data and cross - correlating it against the @xcite grid . although we have fixed @xmath3 and previously determined @xmath32 ( see section [ sec : kinematic - analysis ] ) we still carried out the cross - correlation to yield a reliable initial estimate of @xmath4 , [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath8/fe ] .",
    "we also used the synthetic flux at the grid point with the peak cross - correlation coefficient to subsequently estimate the normalisation coefficients @xmath54 .",
    "we numerically optimised the negative log - probability @xmath55 from the initial point using the nelder - mead algorithm @xcite .",
    "following optimisation , we sampled the resulting posterior using the affine - invariant markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) sampler introduced by @xcite and implemented by @xcite . in all cases",
    "at least 200 walkers were used to explore the parameter space for more than 2500 steps ( @xmath56 probability evaluations ) to burn - in the sampler .",
    "these probability calls were discarded and the chains were reset before production sampling began .",
    "we tested our mcmc analyses for convergence by examining the auto - correlation times ( e.g. , ensuring high effective sample numbers per parameter ) and the mean acceptance fractions over time .",
    "we also re - ran a subset of our analyses with many more evaluations ( for both burn - in and production ) , verifying that there was no change to the resulting posteriors .",
    "we list the photometric effective temperatures and other inferred stellar parameters ( given the model and effective temperature ) in table [ tbl2 ] .",
    "the middle panels of figure [ fig : stellar_params ] show the inferred surface gravities for all candidates .",
    "our confirmed members agree well with the metal - poor isochrone shown .",
    "this is particularly true for the higher - quality reticulum  2 data , with the possible exception of the metal - poor giant reti  4 , where the @xmath4 seems quite low .",
    "although this star has the highest s / n ratio in our sample , metal - poor super giant stars are very challenging to model from an astrophysical perspective . nevertheless , the marginalised posterior metallicity distribution for reti  4 agrees excellently with stars further down the giant branch of lower s / n ratios .",
    "table  [ tbl2 ] also lists the reduced @xmath21 values of our spectral fits . in general",
    "the values are quite close to 1 .",
    "however due to lower s / n and imperfect sky - subtraction in the horologium  1 data , the @xmath21/d.o.f .",
    "values for those candidates are slightly higher .",
    "our radial velocity determination for reti  22 confirms it as a horizontal branch member of reticulum  2 ( see section [ sec : membership - model ] ) .",
    "however , the photometric temperature estimate of 8468@xmath57k prohibited us from inferring other stellar parameters for this star , as it is hotter than the boundary ( 8000k ) of the spectral grid .",
    "two members of reticulum  2 have maximum a posteriori ( map ) @xmath4 values that are consistent with being a dwarf ( figure [ fig : stellar_params ] ) .",
    "this is inconsistent with the photometry , since the main - sequence is too faint for us to target with standard exposure times for gaia - eso survey milky way fields .",
    "however , the negative uncertainties on @xmath4 for these two reticulum  2 members are considerably large , making them deviate from the giant branch by only 1 to 1.5@xmath58 . as a test we constrained the prior on surface gravity to be uninformative between @xmath59 $ ] , forcing the star to be a giant / sub - giant , but we found no statistically significant difference in the marginalized posterior metallicity distribution .",
    "similarly while all confirmed horologium  1 stars are giants , and the foreground contaminants are clearly dwarfs , one star ( horo  17 ) has a very low s / n and consequently has an extremely large negative uncertainty in @xmath4 . while the posterior demonstrates the star is not a dwarf , we can not place its precise location on the giant branch .",
    "our inferred [ @xmath8/fe ] abundance ratios are informative , even with their large uncertainties .",

    "according to the mass estimator of @xcite we estimate the total mass inside the half - light radii of horologium  1 is @xmath375 ( notice however a very big error bar ) .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio of @xmath2600 is similar to that observed in reticulum  2 .        *",
    "the average metallicity of stars in both systems is very low ( one of the lowest among dwarf galaxies ) , but both dwarfs lie well on the existing mass / luminosity - metallicity correlation ( see bottom left panel of figure  [ fig : feh_scatter ] ) . * the metallicity spread , although uncertain , is significantly different from zero , matching what is observed in other dwarf galaxies ( top left panel of figure  [ fig : feh_scatter ] ) .",
    "it is possible though that the spread seen in horologium  1 and reticulum  2 is somewhat smaller than the spread of 0.50.7dex observed in other ultra - faint systems such as segue  1 @xcite , but this could simply be a result of small sample sizes . * the dark matter content and the mass - to light ratio in the observed systems seem to agree well with the existing correlations with galaxy luminosity ( right panel of figure  [ fig : feh_scatter ] ) .",
    "this suggests that even with these new discoveries of ultra - faint dwarfs we have not reached the limiting density scale of dark matter , which would inform us about the elusive properties of dark matter @xcite .",
    "given their proximity to the lmc and the smc on the sky , there exists an exhilarating possibility that some of the newly discovered satellites , including reticulum  2 and horologium  1 , have once been part of the great magellanic family . if such a connection proves true , there is hope to link the internal properties of the dwarfs ( e.g. , their dark matter content , the star - formation and the enrichment histories ) with their orbital motion before and during the accretion onto the milky way .",
    "thus , finally , an in - depth self - consistent picture of the ufs formation and evolution can be assembled .",
    "considering the total number of satellites discovered in the sdss , vst atlas and panstarrs surveys , the relatively small patch of sky covered by the first year of des observations appears unusually rich in satellites .",
    "according to k15 , the over - density of satellites around the magellanic clouds is moderate but significant , with at least 3 - 4 objects possibly belonging to the lmc / smc pair .",
    "note however , that the above calculation does not account for the fact that for the faintest systems ( e.g. , direct analogs of reticulum  2 and horologium  1 ) , the sdss census is incomplete beyond 50 kpc .",
    "therefore the number of faintest dwarfs within the des footprint  namely those with @xmath376  have to be estimated under the assumption of their galacto - centric radial distribution",
    ". given perfect freedom , it seems plausible to find a radial profile flat enough to produce as many faint satellites as have been discovered in the des data .",
    "this , however , would seem to be in tension with the lack of discoveries from surveys like vst atlas and panstarrs . in the absence of completeness estimates for the ongoing imaging surveys , we attempt to clarify the connection between the newly discovered satellites and the magellanic clouds by complementing their 3d positions with the radial velocity measurements obtained with the vlt .",
    "the satellites kinematics can be compared to predictions made from osmological zoom - in simulations .",
    "for example , according to @xcite , the distribution of the satellites in phase - space reveals the time of accretion of the magellanic system . by finding one suitable lmc analog in the high - resolution aquarius suite @xcite ,",
    "@xcite convincingly demonstrate that a high concentration of the former lmc companions is expected in the cloud s vicinity if the lmc has only had one peri - center crossing .",
    "more recently , a systematic analysis of 25 lmc analogs in the elvis suite of cosmological zoom - in simulations has been presented by @xcite . here , rather than a report on a case study , an evidence for a trend between the @xmath377 phase - space scatter of the lmc satellites and the group in - fall time is presented .",
    "according to @xcite , the observed distribution of satellites discovered in the des data appears consistent with a recent , i.e. @xmath3782 gyr , accretion . for such late events",
    ", the authors also provide a rough estimate of the total number of past lmc satellites in the des footprint : based on positions alone , there should be at least 4 such objects in the current des sample . both @xcite and @xcite",
    "emphasize the role that kinematics play in uncovering the origin of the milky way satellites : chance spatial alignments are possible , however these are in general less likely in the vicinity of the group s central ( e.g. , in the lmc ) .",
    "the benefit of these n - body simulations is that they paint a fully consistent cosmological portrait of the magellanic group , both in terms of accretion history as well as the amount of expected substructure .",
    "however , it is obvious that these simulations can not match either the exact orbit of the lmc nor the presence of its massive companion , the smc . to complement",
    "the cosmological n - body zoom - in runs , controlled simulations of lmc / smc accretion can be mass - produced for a much larger range of the in - fall parameters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we will describe the outcome of such an experiment in the future ( see jethwa et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    "meanwhile , we can shed some light onto possible links between the magellanic clouds and reticulum  2 or horologium  1 by comparisons with the observed kinematics of the magellanic gaseous stream ( ms ) .",

    "kms@xmath11 in extent . as indicated by the rapidly changing color , portions of the stream at varying @xmath380",
    "contribute different amounts of velocity signal at given @xmath379 .",
    "note however that the steep velocity gradient as a function of the ms longitude is predominantly caused by the solar reflex motion .",
    "this is confirmed in the bottom left panel of figure  [ fig : mstream ] which displays the map of in the plane of @xmath379 and galacto - centric radial velocity @xmath385 .",
    "the @xmath385 signature of the stream remains largely constant up to @xmath386 where it starts to decline , but slower than with respect to @xmath387 .",
    "as obvious from both velocity maps described above , the ms is detected near the positions of reticulum  2 and horologium  1 in the ( @xmath379 , @xmath32 ) plane .",
    "however , the region of phase - space occupied by the dwarfs is dominated by the gas at negative @xmath380 ( i.e. , around the smc ) as evidenced by the blue tint of this portion of the image .",
    "the bottom right panel of figure  [ fig : mstream ] illustrates the range of possible velocities of the ms with positive @xmath388 only ( i.e. , those around reticulum  2 and horologium  1 ) . at the longitude of reticulum  2",
    ", there is a gap of order of 100  kms@xmath11 between the grey - scale density map of the ms and the velocity of reticulum  2 .",
    "however near horologium  1 , the ms gas completely extends to the measured velocity of the satellite .",
    "the offset in the line - of - sight velocity between the trailing ms and the satellites is expected , as stripped gas can experience a drag force through interactions with the hot galactic corona . the drag will decelerate the stream clouds , causing them to fall to lower galactocentric radii . to make sense of the radial velocities of reticulum  2 and horologium  1 ,",
    "let us recall their locations with respect to the milky way center and the magellanic clouds . in 3d space , reticulum  2 is in front of the clouds , @xmath224kpc away from the lmc and @xmath239kpc from the smc , while horologium  1 is behind the clouds , @xmath238kpc away from the lmc and @xmath232kpc from the smc .",
    "importantly , both satellites are trailing the lmc , as evidenced from the cloud s orbital motion shown in figure  20 of k15 .",
    "the black solid line in the bottom right panel of figure  [ fig : mstream ] shows the projection of a backward - integrated lmc orbit from k15 , namely the one with the nfw s concentration @xmath389 , projected onto the plane of @xmath379 and @xmath385 .",
    "the orbit attains negative line - of - sight velocities at @xmath390 and appears to be in reasonable agreement with the velocity of horologium  1 at the corresponding ms longitude .",
    "this implies that the 4d coordinate of horologium  1 is consistent with those expected for the lmc s trailing debris . at the location of reticulum",
    "2 the velocity gap of @xmath2100  kms@xmath11 persists .",
    "it is tempting to assert that this precludes the possibility of an association between reticulum  2 and the lmc .",
    "however , it is unrealistic to expect reticulum  2 to behave simply like the lmc trailing debris . during tidal disruption",
    "it is normal to expect the trailing debris to form from particles with higher energy and angular momentum than the progenitor .",
    "subsequently the trailing debris also have larger galactocentric radii on average , and longer orbital periods .",
    "yet , we know that reticulum  2 is closer to the milky way s center than the lmc itself .",
    "thus , in order to explain its origin as part of the magellanic family , an additional factor needs to be included .",
    "it is conceivable that an interaction with the smc would be sufficient to drive reticulum  2 onto it s current orbit .",
    "finally , we have not yet considered the possibility that reticulum  2 and/or horologium  1 could still be bound to the lmc .",
    "superficially , such situation seems unlikely given the distances between the lmc and the two satellites . however , @xcite report spectroscopically confirmed detection of the likely lmc s stellar halo some 22@xmath391 degrees away from the lmc , at angular distances comparable to reticulum  2 and horologium  1 . motivated by this discovery , we test whether the line - of - sight velocities of reticulum  2 and horologium  1 are consistent with the lmc s halo .",
    "the dashed lines in the bottom right panel of figure  [ fig : mstream ] show projections of the lmc velocity vector onto several lines - of - sight .",
    "the black dashed curve corresponds to the lines - of - sight slicing the lmc s halo at @xmath392 .",
    "blue ( red ) dashed curve shows the run of the projection of the mean lmc s halo velocity along the line - of - sight moving from the lmc s center to the location of reticulum  2 ( horologium  1 ) as shown in the top left panel of the figure . at the position of reticulum  2 , the line - of - sight velocity of non - rotating lmc s halo would be @xmath393  kms@xmath11",
    ", some @xmath280  kms@xmath11 away the galactocentric velocity of reticulum  2 , @xmath394  kms@xmath11 .",
    "however , at the position of horologium  1 , the lmc s halo s line - of - sight velocity is predicted to be @xmath395  kms@xmath11 , only 15  kms@xmath11 away from the galactocentric velocity of the satellite @xmath396  kms@xmath11 .",
    "it is important to note that while horologium  1 is located at a similar angular distance from the lmc as compared to the stellar halo detections reported by @xcite , it is probably twice as far away from the lmc in 3d , i.e. 40kpc instead of 20kpc . to explain the dynamics of the lmc+smc system and the formation of the ms , @xcite advocate the existence of a massive ( @xmath397 ) dark matter halo of the lmc .",
    "the corresponding virial radius of this halo would be @xmath398 100kpc , while its ( approximate ) tidal radius just under 40kpc .",
    "if the lmc is on its first pericenter crossing , then given the weak tides the lmc has been experiencing so far , it is reasonable to expect that its dark matter distribution can extend as far as 40kpc .",
    "therefore , surprisingly , there appears to be some probability that horologium  1 is still gravitationally bound to the large magellanic cloud .",
