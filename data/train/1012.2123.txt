    "the area based distance to a convex planar curve at a point @xmath1 is defined as the minimum area of a region bounded by the curve and a line through @xmath1 and is a well known concept in computer vision ( @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we consider a generalization of this distance to a pair of planar curves as follows : for a pair of parameterized planar curves @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , denote by @xmath5 the midpoint of the chord @xmath6 and by @xmath7 the area of the region bounded by the two curves , the chord @xmath6 and some other arbitrary fixed chord .",
    "we shall call the map @xmath8 the _ generalized area distance _ of the pair of curves @xmath2 .",
    "when @xmath9 and @xmath10 are parameterizations of the same convex curve without parallel tangents , the function @xmath11 is exactly the area distance of the curve ( @xcite ) .",
    "it turns out that any generalized area distance map is an improper indefinite affine sphere with singularities .",
    "reciprocally , any improper indefinite affine sphere is obtained as a generalized distance of a pair of planar curves .",
    "this correspondence between generalized area distance and improper indefinite affine spheres is the main theme of this paper .",
    "the singularity set of the generalized area distance is formed by the pairs @xmath12 whose corresponding velocity vectors @xmath13 and @xmath14 are parallel .",
    "thus it coincides with a well - known symmetry set associated with the curves @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the _ area evolute _ , also called _ midpoint parallel tangent locus _ ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "improper affine maps were introduced in @xcite for convex surfaces as a class of improper affine spheres with singularities . for non - convex surfaces , a similar class of improper affine spheres with singularities",
    "was introduced in @xcite , where they were called _ improper indefinite affine maps _",
    ", shortly _ indefinite ia - maps_. in our representation , elements of this class correspond to generalized area distances such that @xmath9 and @xmath10 are regular curves , i.e. , @xmath15 , @xmath3 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "the representation of @xcite is based on two para - holomorphic functions , and it is easy to pass from them to the pair or planar curves of our representation and vice - versa .",
    "the advantage of working with our representation is that we gain a lot of geometric insight about the indefinite improper affine maps .",
    "for example , the nature of the non - degenerate singular points of the indefinite ia - maps is studied in @xcite , and we do a similar study here , but correlating with the geometry of the area evolute of the pair of planar curves .    besides the area evolute , there are some other well known symmetry sets associated with a pair of plane curves , namely , the affine envelope symmetry set ( aess ) and the affine area symmetry set ( aass ) ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "each of these sets can be transported to the surface by our representation formula .",
    "the aass corresponds to the self - intersection set of the affine sphere , while the aess corresponds to points of local symmetry of the affine sphere .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we review some well - known facts about affine immersions . in section 3 , we describe the promised representation formula . in section 4 , we study the singularity set of the improper affine sphere while in section 5 we discuss the subsets of the affine sphere that correspond to the aess and the aass .",
