    "the idea of a `` pulsational pair - instability supernova '' ( ppisn ) was introduced by @xcite and explored in some detail by @xcite . for a range of helium core masses above approximately 35 @xmath0 ,",
    "the production of electron - positron pairs occurs during central neon burning and triggers an instability that leads to rapid contraction of the core and explosive nuclear burning .",

    "if the core mass is above 133 @xmath0 , for reasonable nuclear reaction rates , convection theory , and no rotation , nuclear burning is unable to reverse the collapse and a black hole forms @xcite .    for helium core masses from 35 - 65 @xmath0 ,",
    "although explosive burning is violent and energetic , it can not unbind the entire star , and cycles of instability and mass ejection can instead occur .",
    "the energy , duration , and mass ejected by these nuclear - powered pulses increases as the helium core mass rises , and by about 45 @xmath0  they are sufficient to produce sn - like displays @xcite .",
    "if the helium core is capped by a substantial hydrogen envelope , the first strong pulse ejects it . depending on the radius and mass of the envelope , this initial",
    "ejection may give rise to either a faint or rather typical type iip sn .",
    "subsequent pulses later overtake and collide with the first and produce a much brighter type iin sn .",
    "if there is no hydrogen envelope , collisions between helium shells can produce a bright type i sn .",
    "the helium core mass range from 45 to 55 @xmath0  is particularly interesting because the characteristic time scale between pulsations is years and the collisions between shells ejected with speeds @xmath2 1000 km s@xmath3 occur at 10@xmath4 - 10@xmath5 cm , where the collision energy is mostly dissipated by optical emission .",
    "since the collision energy can approach 10@xmath6 erg , a superluminous event can result .",
    "the discovery of both pi and ppi sn candidates in the local universe , and the realization that such events might be visible at high redshifts , have excited interest in this exotic explosion mechanism .",
    "sn 2007bi at @xmath7 0.127 @xcite and sn 2213 - 1745 at @xmath8 2.06 @xcite are pisn candidates , and sn 1000@xmath90216 at @xmath7 3.90 @xcite and perhaps sn 2006 oz at @xmath7 0.376 @xcite may be ppisne .",
    "@xcite suggest that sn 2007bi may be a magnetar spin - down powered event @xcite or it could be due to an interaction between h - poor sn ejecta and a circumstellar medium @xcite .",
    "the nature of these transients is still under debate . @xcite",
    "have now shown that ppisne , like pisne and type iine , may be visible to the _ james webb space telescope _ ( _ jwst _ ) and the wide - field infrared survey telescope ( wfirst ) at @xmath10 20 ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "these explosions , together with other population iii ( pop iii ) sne @xcite , could probe the properties of the first stars and galaxies @xcite , early cosmological reionization and chemical enrichment @xcite , and the origins of supermassive black holes @xcite .",
    "understanding the observational signatures of ppisne is key to properly identifying them as more of them are discovered by the new sn factories such as the palomar transient factory ( ptf ; * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite modeled a ppisn in one dimension ( 1d ) with the ` kepler ` code @xcite and its light curve with the ` stella ` code @xcite . in these simulations , a large density spike formed during the collision between the second two pulses and the first .",
    "rapid variations in the density of the spike due to a radiative instability @xcite imposed large fluctuations in the bolometric luminosity .",
    "@xcite noted similar features in the near infrared ( nir ) light curves of the same ppisn modeled with the los alamos ` rage ` code .",
    "such spikes would probably not appear in multidimensional flows because hydrodynamic instabilities would likely erase the sharp interface between the pulses .",
    "it is not clear how these processes would change the luminosity of the collision .",
    "radiation hydrodynamical simulations in at least two dimensions ( 2d ) with adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) are clearly required to resolve the thin radiating region between the shells during the collision and properly model the light curves of ppisne .",
    "but such simulations push the envelope of even state - of - the - art numerical codes . as a first step to this goal",
    ", we have performed the first 2d simulations of a ppisn with the ` castro ` code with hydrodynamics but not radiation transport . in section 2",
    "we describe our ppisn model and how it is evolved in ` castro ` . in section 3",
    "we examine the collision of the shells in 2d in detail , and in section 4 we show how the evolution of the collision in 2d might change the ppisn light curves of previous calculations .",
    "we conclude in section 5 .",
    "we take as a fiducial case the ppisn examined in @xcite , whose progenitor was a solar - metallicity star with an initial main sequence mass of 110 @xmath0 .",
    "the mass loss rate was artificially reduced so that the star had a total mass of 74.6 @xmath0  and a helium core mass of 49.9 @xmath0  when it died .",
    "the star produces three violent outbursts .",
    "the first , p1 , ejects most of the hydrogen envelope , making a faint type ii supernova and leaving a residual of 50.7 @xmath0 , just a bit more than the helium core itself .",
    "after 6.8 yr , the core again contracts and encounters the pair instability , twice in rapid succession .",
    "the total mass of the second and third pulses ( p2 and p3 ) is 5.1 @xmath0  and their kinetic energy is @xmath12 erg .",
    "p3 collides with p2 at large optical depths that are not visible to an external observer .",
    "these combined shells then overtake p1 at @xmath2 10@xmath4 cm and speeds of a few 1000 km s@xmath3 . about 90% of the energy of this collision",
    "is radiated away by 10@xmath5 cm , with peak bolometric luminosities of @xmath13 .      `",
    "castro ` is a multi - dimensional amr astrophysical fluid dynamics code @xcite .",
    "it has an unsplit piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ) hydro scheme @xcite and multispecies advection .",
    "the equation of state used in our study was taken from @xcite , and has contributions from relativistic @xmath14 pairs of arbitrary degeneracy , ions , which are treated as an ideal gas , and photons .",
    "densities , velocities , temperatures and mass fractions from ` kepler ` were mapped onto a 2d cylindrical grid in ` castro ` with the conservative scheme of @xcite , which guarantees that quantities such as energy and mass are strictly conserved . because only one quadrant of the star is mapped onto the mesh , outflow and reflecting boundary conditions were set on the upper and lower boundaries in @xmath15 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "three levels of adaptive refinement ( for up to 64 times greater resolution along each axis ) were used to resolve the scales on which instabilities form in the flow , and the grid refinement criteria are based on gradients of density , velocity , and pressure .",
    "we use the monopole approximation for self - gravity , in which a 1d gravitational potential is constructed from the radial average of the density and then applied to gravitational force updates everywhere in the amr hierarchy .",
    "this approximation is very efficient , and well - suited to the nearly spherical symmetry of the star and its pulsations .",
    "in principle , partial fallback from one pulse could collide with a subsequent ejection and seed the formation of instabilities and mixing before the pulses themselves collide .",
    "we investigate this process with a 2d simulation in ` castro ` in which we follow fallback from p2 onto p3 .",
    "this simulation must be performed on a much smaller mesh that excludes p1 in order to resolve the length scales of nuclear burning , which powers the pulses , and the onset of any fluid instabilities near the core .",
    "it is initialized with a ` kepler ` output at an intermediate time from @xcite , @xmath2 100 sec before p2 .",
    "our ` castro ` mesh is 5 @xmath16 10@xmath17 cm on a side with @xmath18 zones at the coarsest level . as in ` kepler `",
    ", nuclear burning is calculated with a 19-isotope network that includes species from hydrogen through @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the star is evolved until the expulsion of p3 .",
    "gas velocities and densities at the end of this run are shown in figure  [ fig : ppsn_p2p3 ] .",
    "fallback from p2 does trigger mild perturbations in the velocities near the surface of p3 , on the order of a few percent of the local sound speed , but they do not result in any discernible features in the densities .",
    "this simulation demonstrates that launching collision models in ` castro ` from ` kepler ` snapshots at later times will not exclude serious dynamical instabilities originating from fallback at earlier times .",
    "modeling perturbations in the gas due to fallback from all three pulses at the same time at the required resolution would require a grid that is four orders of magnitude larger than this one , so we approximate these features in our collision models by seeding the grid with random velocity perturbations of order about @xmath20 of local sound speed .",
    "to study the collisions between the three pulses , we initialize ` castro ` with a ` kepler ` profile taken at a later time , after all three eruptions have occurred and when p1 is at 2 @xmath16 10@xmath5 cm , as shown in figure  [ fig : init_v ] . since @xcite and @xcite both predict that most of the radiation from the collision between shells p2/p3 and p1 is emitted by the time the shock has reached 10@xmath5 cm , we set the outer boundaries of the grid in @xmath15 and @xmath11 to be 10@xmath5 cm .",
    "we do not include all of p1 in our simulation because the density beyond @xmath21 cm is extremely low and most fluid instabilities forming during collisions have become frozen in mass coordinate before reaching this boundary .",
    "with amr , the effective spatial resolution can be as fine as 10@xmath22 cm , which is sufficient for capturing the fine structure of each pulse , as we show in figure  [ fig : init_den ] ) and fluid instabilities in the flow later on .",
    "all three pulses are evolved until the collision shock reaches the simulation boundary , about 260 days after the launch of the run .    at the beginning of the simulation ,",
    "the peak velocities of p2 and p3 are 3.9 @xmath16 10@xmath23 cm s@xmath3 and 4.8 @xmath16 10@xmath23 cm s@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the faster p3 overtakes p2 within 50 days and has completely merged with it at @xmath24 .",
    "the contact discontinuity that forms between p3 and p2 upon collision rapidly destabilizes into the mild , finger - like fluid instabilities that are visible at 2.5 @xmath16 10@xmath25 cm in figure  [ fig : col_den ] .",
    "these fingers are 2 - 3@xmath26 in size , with overdensities of 5 - 10 .",
    "the combined pulse has a complex structure with multiple velocity peaks , the highest of which is @xmath27 cm s@xmath3 .",
    "the bright emission from this collision is probably not visible to an external observer because it originates from very optically thick regions that are well below the photosphere at @xmath2 8 @xmath28 .",
    "nevertheless , this radiation may be able affect the dynamics of the ejecta or diffuse out of it at later times .",
    "after p2 and p3 collide , they together begin to overtake p1 , which now has a radius 100 times that of the original star . unlike the first collision ,",
    "the second collision is more like that between supernova ejecta and a dense shell expelled by the star prior to its death ( type iin sne , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although this collision is less violent than a type iin sn , the instabilities eventually grow to larger amplitudes than in the first collision , as we show in figure  [ fig : shell_rev ] .",
    "the clumpy structures behind the shock grow in size as the flow expands , driving more mixing and dredging up heavier elements from deeper layers .",
    "we plot angle - averaged mass fractions for @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 in figure  [ fig : mixing ] as the shock approaches the photosphere .",
    "most mixing happens by @xmath2 @xmath33 , and elements heavier than @xmath34  remain deeper in the ejecta , so they would not appear in the spectra .",
    "the formation of dynamical instabilities during the collisions can be understood on analytical grounds .",
    "both times , the instabilities appear because the shock decelerates as it plows up gas and forms a reverse shock . for a strong adiabatic shock in a power - law density profile , @xmath35 ,",
    "the flow becomes self - similar , and the physical quantities that describe it can be combined into a single , dimensionless function , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the explosion energy and @xmath38 is the time @xcite . the velocity of the shock can then be derived from dimensional analysis : @xmath39 for @xmath40 , the shock decelerates as it plows up material .",
    "this deceleration is communicated to the fluid behind by the shock at the sound speed , and it creates a pressure gradient in the direction of the deceleration . the sound wave generated by the deceleration can steepen this pressure gradient , and a reverse shock forms . if the gas pressure , @xmath41 , and the density , @xmath42 , satisfy the rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) criterion for an fluid @xcite @xmath43 then instabilities will form . whether or not a reverse shock forms can be determined by the @xmath44 profile in the surrounding medium .",
    "if @xmath45 increases with radius , conditions are favorable for the formation of a reverse shock .",
    "we plot this quantity for the time at which our ` castro ` run is launched in figure  [ fig : rhor3 ] .",
    "the peaks and valleys at @xmath46 were created by the ejection of p2 and p3 .",
    "the acceleration and deceleration of the shock in this rapidly varying region causes the smaller fluid instabilities in the first collision shown in figure  [ fig : col_den ] . the steady increase in @xmath44 at @xmath47",
    "leading up to p1 allows the instabilities to grow to larger amplitudes during the second collision .",
    "when the rt fingers become nonlinear , kelvin - helmholtz ( or shear ) instabilities arise and dominate the mixing , which continues until the collision shock breaks through p1 .",
    "figure  [ fig : grid ] shows the amr grid structure when the mixing occurs .",
    "many fine grids are generated to resolve the clumpy structure due to mixing .",
    "most of the luminosity from the second collision is gone before mixing ends .",
    "we approximate the bolometric light curve of this collision by @xcite : @xmath48 where @xmath42 is the gas density just ahead of shock front , @xmath49 is the velocity of the shock , and @xmath15 is the position of the shock .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : psn_vs ] ) holds if the region in which the shock propagates is assumed to be optically thin , and is therefore an upper limit in somewhat higher densities . to take into account energy dissipation in the shock by escaping photons , we assume that the luminosity of the shock falls as @xmath50 when the shock front is beyond @xmath51 .",
    "we assume that the temperature at the edge of the shock falls as @xmath52 due to thermal radiation , so the bolometric luminosity @xmath53 we plot this luminosity in figure  [ fig : light ] .",
    "the collision produces a very bright transient , with a peak luminosity of @xmath2 @xmath54 and a duration of @xmath2 100 days .",
    "the peak luminosity occurs when p2+p3 collide with p1 .",
    "its magnitude is calculated with equation  ( [ eq : psn_vs ] ) , with @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 cm / s .",
    "the peak luminosity and duration are similar to those of the 1d radiation hydrodynamics models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "but our light curve rises earlier because we assume that the environment of the shock is optically thin . unlike the 1d light curves , which exhibit artificial fluctuations due to a radiative instability , the light curve of our 2d model has a relatively smooth peak and no fluctuations .",
    "our model suggests that radiation hydrodynamical calculations of ppisn light curves in 2d will also be smoother than those in 1d because mixing will dampen the radiative instability , but that they will have similar luminosities .",
    "we calculate 2d light curves with equation ( 3 ) with angle - averaged densities and velocities at radii just ahead of the shock .",
    "this light curve is a rough estimate of the luminosity of the shock and does not include radiation from dense clumps due to shell collisions .",
    "although the 2d light curve has similar luminosities to 1d models , the light curve rising time and fading tail are still quite different between 1d and 2d .",
    "full radiation transport in 2d is needed for more realistic light curves of ppisn models .",
    "we have performed the first 2d hydrodynamical simulations of ppisne with the new ` castro ` code . we find that mild rt instabilities develop first during the collision of p3 with p2 and then become stronger as p2 and p3 interact with p1 .",
    "fallback from one pulsation onto another does not seed strong instabilities but does mildly perturb the flow prior to collisions .",
    "the appearance of dynamical instabilities and mixing has three consequences for the observational signatures of ppisne that are not captured in 1d models .",
    "first , the radiative instabilities that cause light curves to fluctuate in 1d models probably do not happen in actual explosions . mixing between shells",
    "dampens the formation of the density spikes in 1d models that give rise to these features .",
    "second , the formation of dense clumps by rt fingers could trap photons and alter the luminosity of these events .",
    "we neglect radiative cooling by metals and dust in our models so these clumps may catastrophically cool and become much denser ( and more opaque ) in actual collisions .",
    "this in turn could amplify the rt instabilities .",
    "finally , since mixing is strongest in the region of the flow from which most of the luminosity of the collision originates , it will alter the order in which specific absorption and emission lines appear in the spectrum over time .",
    "in particular , our model predicts enhanced spectral lines from @xmath30 and @xmath31 at earlier times in the second collision .",
    "the appearance of such lines may prove to be powerful diagnostics of mixing in ppisne .",
    "since our approximate bolometric luminosities are similar to those calculated with full radiation transport in earlier work , future multidimensional calculations will probably not change the recent result that these explosions will be visible at @xmath7 10 - 20 to _ jwst _ and wfirst .",
    "but they do demonstrate that multidimensional radiation transport will be required to model how radiation is emitted by and escapes from the complex structures formed by dynamical instabilities",
    ". this will be key to obtaining more realistic light curves and spectra for ppisne . in future papers",
    ", we will better survey ppisn explosions by examining more progenitor models at low metallicities with 2d radiation hydrodynamical calculations @xcite .",
    "ppisne will soon open new windows on massive star formation in both the primordial and the local universe .",
