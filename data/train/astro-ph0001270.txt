    "the nature of supernovae ( sne ) of type ib and ic has been the subject of much speculation ; see harkness & wheeler ( 1990 ) for an early review , and clocchiatti et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for a more recent discussion .",
    "spectra of sne ib / c lack the hydrogen lines that distinguish sne ii , yet they are also missing the deep absorption near 6150   ( thought",
    "to be blueshifted @xmath46355 ) that characterizes sne ia .",
    "the defining characteristic of sne ib is the presence of strong lines near maximum light .",
    "this is followed by a nebular - phase spectrum dominated by emission lines of [ ] , [ ] , and .",
    "sne ic are spectroscopically quite similar to sne ib , but they do not show the strong lines .",
    "this results in the occasional designation of sne ic as `` helium - poor '' sne ib ( wheeler et al .",
    "1987 ) .",
    "the most widely accepted model for the sn ib / c explosion mechanism is that it is related to the mechanism of sne ii",
    " core collapse in massive stars  but that sne ib / c have lost their hydrogen ( and helium , in the case of sne ic ) envelopes through winds or mass transfer to a companion ( e.g. , woosley , langer , & weaver 1993 ; yamaoka , shigeyama , & nomoto 1993 ; nomoto et al .",
    "1994 ; iwamoto et al .",
    "there is considerable circumstantial evidence that the progenitors of sne ib and ic are massive stars .",
    "sne ib / c are associated with population i stars ( wheeler & levreault 1985 ; uomoto & kirshner 1985 ; harkness et al .",
    "1987 ; huang 1987 ; van dyk 1992 ; bartunov et al .",
    "1994 , van dyk , hamuy , & filippenko 1996 ) , their hosts are virtually always late - type galaxies ( porter & filippenko 1987 ) , and they exhibit radio emission ( e.g. , weiler et al . 1998 , and references therein ) , thought to be the result of interaction with circumstellar material ( chevalier 1982 , 1984 ) . contrasted with this are the favored progenitors of sne ia , white dwarfs ( e.g. , branch et al . 1995 ; livio 1999 ) , although models for sne ib / c using white dwarfs as progenitors have been proposed ( e.g. , branch & nomoto 1986 ; iben et al . 1987 ) .",
    "the late - time spectra of sne ib / c are also very similar to those of sne ii , with the obvious exception of the hydrogen lines .",
    "perhaps the best evidence connecting sne ib / c with sne ii is the direct transformation of an individual supernova from one type to another .",
    "sn 1987k was initially spectroscopically a type ii , but the late - time spectra resembled those of sne ib ( filippenko 1988 ) ; it thus earned a new label , type iib ( after woosley et al . 1987 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the actual transition was not observed .",
    "filippenko ( 1992 ) and jeffery et al . (",
    "1991 ) also suggested that the type ic sn 1987 m showed evidence of hydrogen in its spectrum .",
    "like sn 1987k , sn 1993j was spectroscopically a sn ii in the first few weeks after explosion , but then began to exhibit the lines of a sn ib , making it a sn iib ( filippenko & matheson 1993 ; filippenko , matheson , & ho 1993 ; swartz et al . 1993a ; wheeler & filippenko 1996 ) .",
    "the various theoretical models rapidly converged on the same general concept  a massive star that had lost most , but not all , of its hydrogen envelope ( woosley et al . 1994 ; wheeler & filippenko 1996 , and references therein ) . gradually the [ ] , [ ] , and emission lines emerged , making the spectrum of sn 1993j closely resemble that of an aging sn ib , although the hydrogen emission never fully disappeared",
    "indeed , the hydrogen emission became very prominent at late times , but this was almost certainly the result of circumstellar interaction ( filippenko , matheson , & barth 1994 ) .",
    "qiu et al .",
    "( 1999 ) document thoroughly a similar transition in sn 1996cb .",
    "although there has been no object showing as definitive a transformation between sne ib and ic as sn 1993j or sn 1996cb showed between sne ii and ib , there have been several sne ic with possible signs of helium in their spectra .",
    "these include the detection of @xmath410830 in sn 1990w ( wheeler et al .",
    "1994 ; based on this line , they propose sn 1990w was misclassified , and should be type ib ) , sn 1994i ( filippenko et al .",
    "1995 ) , and sn 1994ai ( benetti , quoted in clocchiatti et al .",
    "1997 ) , in addition to the discovery of other lines at high velocity in a reanalysis of sn 1994i , sn 1987 m , and sn 1988l ( clocchiatti et al . 1996b ) and in sn 1997x ( munari et al .",
    "( see , however , baron et al . [ 1999 ] and millard et al . [",
    "1999 ] for cautionary arguments . ) by analogy to the models of sn 1993j , one could postulate that the progenitors of sne ic have not only had their hydrogen envelope removed , but most or all of their helium layer as well ( harkness et al .",
    "1987 ; yamaoka , shigeyama , & nomoto 1993 ; swartz et al . 1993b ; iwamoto et al . 1994",
    "nomoto et al . 1994 ) , so the weakness or absence of lines is the result of small abundance .",
    "the sne ic that exhibited some helium would then be the analogs of sn 1993j , but with the transition less obvious .",
    "an alternative explanation for the cause of the differences between sne ib and ic relies on the need for a large amount of non - thermal excitation to form lines ( harkness et al .",
    "1987 ; lucy 1991 ) .",
    "the source of this excitation is electrons accelerated by the @xmath5-rays emitted by the decay of radioactive @xmath6ni synthesized in the explosion . in this scenario ,",
    "helium could be present in sne ic , but the @xmath6ni is not mixed into the helium layers , and so can not produce the helium lines ( e.g. , wheeler et al .",
    "1987 ; shigeyama et al .",
    "1990 ; hachisu et al .",
    "whatever the cause of the helium features , the characteristics of the previous detections of helium in sne ic ( absorption at high velocity ) suggest that the helium is in the ejecta , not the circumstellar material .",
    "the spectrum of a truly transitional object between sne ib and ic could provide clues as to whether the difference between them is the result of abundances , mixing , or both .",
    "in this paper we present optical to near - infrared ( near - ir ) spectra of sn 1999cq , a sn ic with unusual intermediate - width helium emission lines , along with an unfiltered light curve .",
    "we propose that the helium lines represent the detection of material lost from the progenitor shortly prior to explosion .",
    "we also find an excess of blue emission in comparison with other sne ic , with implications for iron and iron - group element abundance , mixing , and the reddening of sn 1999cq .",
    "sn 1999cq was discovered by the lick observatory supernova search ( loss ) ( modjaz & li 1999 ) on 1999 june 25.4 ut , ( jd 2,451,354.9 ; note that all calendar dates used are ut ) at an unfiltered magnitude of @xmath7 16.0 .",
    "it was present on previous images at similar magnitudes ( june 22.4 , @xmath7 15.9 ; june 19.4 , @xmath7 15.8 ) .",
    "an image taken on 1999 june 15.4 showed nothing at the position of the sn to a limit of @xmath7 19.0 mag .",
    "the supernova was 1.@xmath85 east and 4.@xmath81 south of the nucleus of ugc 11268 .",
    "a spectrum obtained july 9.4 ( jd 2,451,368.9 , hereinafter `` the july spectrum '' ) indicated that sn 1999cq was of type ib or ic , and starting to enter the nebular phase , although  d did show a p - cygni profile ( filippenko 1999 ) .",
    "this spectrum was obtained with the kast double spectrograph ( miller & stone 1993 ) at the cassegrain focus of the shane 3-m reflector at lick observatory with an exposure time of 1800 s. reticon @xmath9 pixel ccds were used in both cameras .",
    "the slit was oriented at a position angle of 160@xmath10 to include the galaxy nucleus .",
    "the optimal parallactic angle ( filippenko 1982 ) was 81@xmath10 , but the low airmass ( 1.1 ) and the large slit width ( 3@xmath8 ) imply that the differential light losses were negligible . standard ccd processing and optimal spectral extraction were accomplished with iraf .",
    "we used our own routines to flux calibrate the data , using the sdo comparison star bd  + 28@xmath114211 ( stone 1977 ) in the range 33005400    and the sdg comparison star bd  + 17@xmath114708 ( oke & gunn 1983 ) in the range 53009900   .",
    "telluric absorption bands were removed through division by the intrinsically featureless spectrum of bd+17@xmath114708 ( wade & horne 1988 ) .",
    "the dispersion of the spectrum is @xmath7 5   per pixel .",
    "we obtained a second spectrum on 1999 august 17.3 ( jd 2,451,407.8 , hereinafter `` the august spectrum '' ) under almost identical conditions .",
    "the only differences were a narrower slit width ( 2@xmath8 ) , a slightly higher airmass ( 1.2 ) , and the use of bd  + 26@xmath112606 ( oke & gunn 1983 ) as the comparison star for the red wavelengths .",
    "as sn 1999cq lies in a complex region only 4.@xmath84 from the nucleus of ugc 11268 , background sky subtraction and the extraction of the supernova were extremely difficult .",
    "there is region contamination over a considerable portion of the long slit ( @xmath7 48@xmath8 out of the @xmath7 125@xmath8 spatial extent of our exposures ) .",
    "the least contamination of the object was achieved by choosing sky regions for background subtraction very near the supernova .",
    "there is still some galaxy contamination , made more complicated by unusually strong emission lines .",
    "in fact , the regions of the supernova spectrum near h@xmath2 + [ ] @xmath126548 , 6583 and [ ] @xmath126716 , 6731 still show some unavoidable residual subtraction errors",
    ". incomplete removal of the very strong  d night - sky emission line also affects the spectrum .",
    "the unusual nature of sn 1999cq was not immediately recognized , so it was not followed photometrically through standard @xmath13 filters .",
    "however , ugc 11268 is part of the loss sample of galaxies and is thus imaged regularly ( every three to four days ) with the 0.76-m katzman automatic imaging telescope at lick observatory ( kait ; treffers et al .",
    "1997 ; richmond , treffers , & filippenko 1993 ) .",
    "the detector used by kait is a site @xmath14 pixel ccd with a field of view of 6.8 @xmath15 6.8 .",
    "the observations are taken without a filter , so the light curve for sn 1999cq ( figure 1 ) is measured in unfiltered magnitudes .",
    "photometric calibration of kait images indicates that the unfiltered response is similar to a standard @xmath16 filter .",
    "the images were reduced using a galaxy subtraction technique ; sn 1999cq is in a very complex region of the host galaxy , and traditional aperture or point - spread - function ( psf ) fitting photometry would not perform well .",
    "the template image of ugc 11268 was taken 1998 september 16 with a limiting magnitude of @xmath7 20 .",
    "the template is shifted spatially , scaled to the same intensity level and psf , and then subtracted from each individual observation .",
    "photometry is then performed on the galaxy - subtracted images using psf fitting in daophot with more than 10 stars in the field used to construct the psf .",
    "the magnitude of sn 1999cq was calculated by averaging its magnitude relative to all the stars used to determine the psf .",
    "for all of the observations of sn 1999cq the limiting unfiltered magnitude was @xmath7 19 .",
    "our spectra of sn 1999cq are shown in figure 2 .",
    "a low value for the galactic component of reddening [ @xmath17 mag ] is found using the galactic maps of schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) .",
    "there is no obvious absorption near the location of  d at the redshift of the host galaxy ( @xmath7 7900 km s@xmath1 , determined from the nuclear h@xmath2 emission line ; marzke , huchra , & geller [ 1996 ] found 7890 @xmath18 20 km s@xmath1 for ugc 11268 ) . to determine a 1@xmath19 upper limit on the equivalent width ( ew ) of this line",
    ", we used the relation ew(1@xmath19 ) = @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the width of a resolution element (  ) and @xmath22 is the 1@xmath19 root - mean - square ( rms ) fluctuation of the spectrum around a normalized continuum level , based on the derivation of hobbs ( 1984 ) .",

    "the barbon et al .",
    "( 1990 ) relation would then give @xmath23 mag .",
    "for reasons discussed below , however , we feel that the intrinsic reddening is much lower than this upper limit .",
    "we note that the spectrum of the nucleus of ugc 11268 has a much higher signal - to - noise ratio than that of the supernova , and it shows a strong  d absorption line with an ew of @xmath7 1.7  , for which the barbon et al .",
    "( 1990 ) relation gives @xmath24 mag .",
    "figure 3 provides a montage of sne ib and ic at similar phases of development for direct comparison with sn 1999cq . while the july spectrum of sn 1999cq in many ways resembles a typical sn ic during the transition to the nebular phase ( e.g. , emission lines of [ ] @xmath126300 , 6364 , [ ] @xmath127291 , 7324 , @xmath47774 , and the near - ir triplet ) , there are two striking differences .",
    "the first is the presence in sn 1999cq of several lines in emission at an intermediate velocity width compared with the other lines .",
    "( note that sn 1991ar may show similar emission , but it is much less compelling . )",
    "the second is the unusually large amount of emission at blue wavelengths in sn 1999cq .",
    "most of the emission features in the july spectrum have a full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of 7000 - 9000 km s@xmath1 .",
    "there are three narrow , but resolved ( fwhm @xmath0 2000 km s@xmath1 ) , lines that we identify as @xmath45876 , @xmath46678 , and @xmath47065 .",
    "( a typical unresolved night - sky emission line has fwhm @xmath0 750 km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "the velocity width and flux are uncertain for the @xmath46678 line because of poor subtraction of nearby [ ] @xmath126716 , 6731 emission ( from regions ) and also that its redshifted position of 6860 is coincident with the telluric b - band .",
    "in addition , @xmath45876 is superposed on the p - cygni emission of  d. these issues , along with the noisy nature of the spectrum , make flux determinations problematic .",
    "if we assign a flux value of 1.00 to @xmath45876 , then @xmath46678 is 0.65 and @xmath47065 is 1.61 , with large uncertainties given these caveats .",
    "the august spectrum ( figure 2b ) was extremely weak ; the supernova had faded considerably and was very difficult to detect .",
    "( this was more than 40 days past the last kait image where sn 1999cq was visible , i.e. brighter than the limiting unfiltered magnitude of @xmath7 19 . ) despite this , we still recover clear signs of the supernova .",
    "the near - ir triplet is present , as is the strong amount of emission at blue wavelengths that characterizes the july spectrum .",
    "most importantly , one of the helium lines ( @xmath47065 ) is still clearly visible with approximately the same velocity width .",
    "the photometric evolution of sn 1999cq is fairly unusual .",
    "it is difficult to make direct comparisons with other sne as our values for sn 1999cq are unfiltered magnitudes .",
    "it rose rapidly , climbing above the limiting value of 19 mag by 3.2 mag in 4 days .",
    "the comparison with the @xmath16-band rise of sn ic 1994i ( richmond et al .",
    "1996 ) in figure 1 is particularly dramatic .",
    "sn 1999cq then dropped quickly as well , falling 0.2 mag in the 6 days after the first detection , and then 3.0 mag in the remaining 16 days that it was above the detection limit . during a similar period ( 25 days ) following maximum in the @xmath16 band ,",
    "sn 1994i fell 2.3 mag ( richmond et al .",
    "1996 ) , while sn 1993j declined by 1.0 mag ( richmond et al . 1994 ) . if there are photometric sub - classes for core - collapse sne ( clocchiatti et al . 1996a , 1997 )",
    ", then sn 1999cq clearly belongs to the `` fast '' class .",
    "models for sn 1994i have been able to reproduce a rapidly declining light curve with a core - collapse event in stars whose envelopes have been lost to a companion ( iwamoto et al .",
    "1994 ; woosley et al .",
    "1995 )    there have been no distance measurements for ugc 11268 , although it is a good candidate for ir tully - fisher distance determination ( haynes et al .",
    "if the recession velocity ( 7900 km s@xmath1 ) is chiefly due the hubble flow then the distance of ugc 11268 is 118 mpc ( using @xmath25 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 ) , which is a distance modulus of 35.4 mag .",
    "although our photometric points are unfiltered magnitudes , and the zero - point of our scale is not well determined , our brightest observed magnitude of 15.8 and this distance modulus give us a rough estimate of the absolute magnitude of sn 1999cq near maximum of @xmath26 mag .",
    "while this value is quite uncertain , it is still intriguing . an absolute magnitude",
    "this bright would make sn 1999cq one of the most luminous sne ic ever observed .",
    "clocchiatti et al .",
    "( 1999 ) report an absolute @xmath27 magnitude of @xmath28 @xmath18 0.02 or @xmath29 @xmath18 0.02 for the type ic sn 1992ar .",
    "( the two values are the results of extrapolation of the light curve using two different assumptions for its shape  the fainter value if it followed the slow - type light curve , the brighter one if it were a fast - type decliner . ) in addition , the type ic sn 1998bw ( possibly associated with gamma - ray burst 980425 ) had an absolute magnitude of @xmath30 = @xmath31 ( galama et al .",
    "1998 ) , with an extremely rapid rise to maximum ( woosley , eastman , & schmidt 1999 ) . as clocchiatti et al .",
    "( 1999 ) discuss in detail , the existence of sne ic as bright as sne ia complicates the identification of high - redshift sne used to study cosmological parameters",
    "( riess et al . 1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ) . without spectra of sn 1999cq near maximum light",
    ", it is not possible to determine whether or not it could be mistaken for a sn ia under the difficult conditions presented by the observations of cosmologically distant sne .",
    "nevertheless , such luminous sne ic emphasize the need for careful spectroscopic study of the high - redshift sne .",
    "the detection of the intermediate - width helium lines in the spectra of sn 1999cq requires the presence of helium in the circumstellar environment of the progenitor , but not in the ejecta of the exploding star .",
    "the width of the lines implies that the helium - emitting region is interacting with the expanding ejecta .",
    "the conspicuous absence of balmer emission suggests a very low abundance of hydrogen .",
    "an obvious solution is that sn 1999cq is interacting with material from the progenitor lost through a wind or mass transfer to a companion .",
    "it is also possible that the source of the helium lines is material not originally from the sn progenitor , but rather a companion sufficiently nearby to be affected by the explosion . as mentioned before , mass transfer facilitated by a companion",
    "is a common model for sne ib / c progenitors , and thus the presence of such a companion must be considered .",
    "we note that chugai ( 1986 ) and marietta , burrows , & fryxell ( 1999 ) predicted a similar velocity width ( @xmath3 1000 km s@xmath1 ) for the lines of hydrogen from the interaction of a sn ia with its companion , although those calculations were for material entrained in the ejecta and the resulting emission would not be visible until several hundred days after the explosion .",
    "for sn 1999cq , however , such a companion star would probably be hydrogen - rich if it had accreted hydrogen from the progenitor ; thus , it is more likely that the helium lines are evidence of helium - rich material that was lost from the progenitor itself prior to core collapse .",
    "the helium lines exhibit unusual line intensity ratios . in a typical hydrogen - rich atmosphere with a temperature of @xmath32 k and electron density @xmath33 @xmath34",
    "one would expect the ratio of @xmath47065 to @xmath45876 to be @xmath7 @xmath35 ( osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "the ratio observed here ( 1.61 ) implies a very different state , most likely related to the non - local - thermodynamic - equilibrium excitation required for the helium emission ( lucy 1991 ) .",
    "the work of almog & netzer ( 1989 ) , however , studying the emission - line spectrum of over a wide range of physical conditions , indicates that the large 7065/5876 ratio could be the result of a very high density .",
    "we can not directly apply the numbers calculated by almog & netzer , as their models were for helium in a hydrogen atmosphere .",
    "nonetheless , their results indicate that for a small range of densities ( @xmath36 @xmath34 , at @xmath37 k ) , the strength of the 7065 line becomes greater than that of 5876 .",
    "such a large ratio of 7065/5876 has been observed in other sne that exhibited circumstellar interaction through helium and hydrogen emission lines , including intermediate - width lines ( e.g. , sn 1996l ; benetti et al .",
    "assuming that the trend of increasing 7065/5876 with increasing density applies to an effectively pure helium atmosphere , then the intermediate - width helium lines in sn 1999cq originate in an extremely dense environment .",
    "hydrogen and helium emission lines of similar width were also present in the spectra of sn 1988z ( filippenko 1991 ; stathakis & sadler 1991 ; turatto et al .",
    "chugai & danziger ( 1994 ) ( hereinafter cd94 ) interpreted this intermediate - width component of the emission as evidence for slow radiative shocks propagating either in dense clumps of wind material or in a dense equatorial belt , with both embedded in a uniform wind .",
    "unfortunately , without multiple epochs and well defined broad lines , it is not possible to apply the details of cd94 s models .",
    "moreover , sn 1999cq has the added complication of an apparently pure helium wind , where the issues of excitation and radiative transfer are not as well known ; such a calculation is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "therefore , we can not differentiate between the two scenarios of cd94 .",
    "nonetheless , the qualitative arguments still apply .",
    "intermediate - width components in the spectra of sne are likely to be the result of ejecta interacting with dense material lost from the progenitor prior to explosion .",
    "the lack of narrow ( unresolved ) and broad ( fwhm @xmath38 5000 km s@xmath1 ) lines in our spectra of sn 1999cq implies that the uniform component of both of cd94 s models is either extremely tenuous and/or that helium excitation is more difficult in such rarefied environments .    as noted above , several models for the progenitors of sne ib and ic postulate that they are massive stars that lose their envelopes prior to core collapse . both sn 1987k and sn 1993j provided direct evidence for this mechanism by exhibiting hydrogen emission from the low - mass layer of the progenitor s original envelope that remained . because the late - time spectra of sne ib and ic are similar ( see , e.g. , filippenko 1997 ) , the analogous transformation of a sn ib to a sn ic would be much more subtle .",
    "in fact , sne that have broad he absorption lines that fade during the transition to the nebular stage are , by definition , still called sne ib .",
    "sn 1999cq thus provides evidence for a link in another way .",
    "the lines we observe indicate an almost pure helium mass loss  exactly what the above models have assumed to produce the stripped - envelope progenitors of sne ic .",
    "one question about sn 1999cq remains : is it legitimately a sn ic ?",
    "the late - time spectra of sne ib and ic are similar overall , but the velocity - widths of the lines are different .",
    "schlegel & kirshner ( 1989 ) found the widths of [ ] @xmath126300 , 6364 and [ ] @xmath127291 , 7324 in late - time spectra of sne ib to be fwhm = 4500 @xmath18 600 km s@xmath1 .",
    "in contrast , filippenko et al . (",
    "1995 ) reported fwhm values for [ ] of 9200 km s@xmath1 for sn ic 1994i and 6200 km s@xmath1 for sn ic 1987 m , for spectra at similar phases ( @xmath7 4.6 months after maximum ) . for [ ] , the fwhm was 7700 km s@xmath1 for sn 1994i and 7500 km s@xmath1 for sn 1987 m . in sn 1999cq ,",
    "the fwhm of the [ ] line is 7800 km s@xmath1 , while the [ ] line is 8000 km s@xmath1 ( given the difficulty of determining a continuum level , the uncertainty of these values is @xmath7 15% ) .",
    "the spectrum of sn 1999cq was obtained only a few weeks past maximum , but its rapid evolution ( c.f .",
    "figure 1 ) implies that the relative phase is at least comparable .",
    "filippenko et al .",
    "( 1995 ) interpreted the larger velocity - width of the lines in sn 1994i as indicative of either a higher explosion energy and/or a smaller ejected mass in comparison with sn 1987 m . following this interpretation , sn 1999cq",
    "would have an even larger explosion energy and/or smaller ejected mass .",
    "this is consistent both with the evidence for mass loss , as well as the large luminosity of the event , and it makes the classification of sn 1999cq as a type ic event more secure .    another difference between sne ib and sne ic is the shape of their light curves .",
    "the light curves of sne ib decline more slowly , typically dropping only @xmath7 1.5 mag . in the 25 days after maximum ( @xmath39 magnitude ; schlegel & kirshner 1989 ) .",
    "as noted before , in that same time sn 1994i dropped 2.3 mag . and",
    "sn 1999cq fell by 3.2 mag .",
    "this implies an even more rapid transition to the nebular phase than that of sn 1994i ( @xmath3 2 months ; filippenko et al .",
    "the first spectrum ( july ) was obtained only 24 days following the most recent image without the supernova ( the temporal position relative to the light curve is marked in figure 1 ) , and it clearly shows the onset of nebular features . the rapid rise and fall of sn 1999cq also imply that it was of type ic .    there is no evidence in the spectra of sn 1999cq for the distinguishing characteristic of sne ib  broad helium lines , generally interpreted as p - cygni profiles .",
    "we believe that the p - cygni profile of  d is still evident in figure 2 . the relatively large amount of blue emission in sn 1999cq makes the p - cygni absorption trough more difficult to discern , but it is there .",
    "the blue minimum of the line indicates an expansion velocity of 8300 km s@xmath1 , well in agreement with the widths of the broad lines .",
    "if sn 1999cq did have broad he lines initially , they must have faded very quickly , while the  d line remained .",
    "nonetheless , even if sn 1999cq were originally a sn ib , the intermediate - width lines still imply pure helium mass loss .",
    "as figure 3 shows , sn 1999cq also exhibits an anomalous `` blue bump '' of emission in contrast to other sne ic .",
    "this appears in both of our spectra ( july and august ) .",
    "the spectra of the host galaxy nucleus and nearby regions extracted from the same long - slit exposures show no evidence for unusual blue emission .",
    "given the extreme overlapping of lines , it is difficult to identify individual features other than perhaps ] @xmath44571 and some lines of .",
    "one possible source for the blue emission is a mixture of overlapping iron lines .",
    "clocchiatti et al .",
    "( 1997 ) identified the lines at @xmath44924 , @xmath45018 , and @xmath45169 in the type ic sn 1983v .",
    "they also found blends of multiplets 27 and 28 ( @xmath7 @xmath40  ) , multiplets 37 and 38 ( @xmath7 @xmath41  ) , and multiplet 74 ( near 6200  ) .",
    "other possibilities include multiplets 3 , 14 , and 29 ( @xmath7 @xmath42  ) , multiplets 43 and 50 ( @xmath7 @xmath43  ) , multiplet 42 ( @xmath7 @xmath44  ) , and multiplets 48 and 49 ( @xmath7 @xmath45  ) ( e.g. , phillips 1976 ) .",
    "there is clearly no dearth of potential iron lines in the region of our spectrum that shows this blue emission . in addition , there are several lines from other stable iron - group elements such as co and ni ( see , e.g. , axelrod 1980 ) .    the presence of such strong iron ( and/or iron - group ) lines in sn 1999cq compared to other sne ic might imply that the mixing of @xmath6ni was more extensive in sn 1999cq .",
    "this would , however , contradict the standard predictions of the mixing differences between sne ib and ic ( baron 1992 ) , but only if helium were still present in the atmosphere of the progenitor .",
    "if the progenitor of sn 1999cq had lost most or all of its helium , leaving a c - o core , then considerable mixing of @xmath6ni to the outer layers is possible , resulting in excess iron emission . this could still be consistent with models for mixing in sne ic as the @xmath6ni is not reaching beyond the c - o core into a helium layer .",
    "in addition , the bright absolute magnitude of sn 1999cq may imply the production of more @xmath6ni than is produced in a typical sn ic , thereby providing the excess material to mix into the outer parts of the ejecta .    given the relatively large cross - sections for the iron - group elements",
    ", however , the strong emission lines might not require overly large abundances .",
    "a fully quantitative spectral synthesis model would be necessary to determine the actual abundances .",
    "a further concern for the effect of mixing on the character of the spectrum is that macroscopic mixing of @xmath6ni could occur without necessarily exciting helium , and thus produce the apparent excess of iron - group element emission without creating broad helium lines , as is observed in sn 1999cq .",
    "therefore , sn 1999cq may not provide a discriminant between the mixing models for sne ib and ic .",
    "while there are variations in abundances ( mainly light elements ) and light - curve shapes ( which have implications for synthesized @xmath6ni ) for sne ib and sne ic ; e.g. , clocchiatti et al .",
    "1997 , and references therein ) , to our knowledge no other sn ib or ic has shown such extreme iron or iron - group emission .",
    "spectra of other luminous sne ic ( sn 1992ar , clocchiatti et al .",
    "1999 ; sn 1998bw , branch 1999 ) do not show unusual emission at blue wavelengths .",
    "another explanation for the `` blue bump '' is related to the surrounding environment of the supernova .",
    "one way to increase the blue emission of an object is to scatter the spectrum off of interstellar dust , as in a light echo .",
    "this phenomenon has a long history of discussion in association with sne ( e.g. , zwicky 1940 ; van den bergh 1975 ; chevalier 1986 ; schaefer 1987 ) .",
    "it has only been definitively observed in two supernovae : sn 1987a ( suntzeff et al .",
    "1988 ; crotts 1988 ; gouiffes et al . 1988 ) and sn 1991 t ( schmidt et al .",
    "1994 ; sparks et al .",
    "with spectra from earlier epochs , one can match late - time echoes .",
    "suntzeff et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and schmidt et al .",
    "( 1994 ) each characterized the effects of scattering as a power law ( @xmath46 ) , with @xmath2 values of 4.9 @xmath18 0.8 and 2 , respectively .",
    "( crotts [ 1988 ] found @xmath47 from broad - band colors . ) not having other spectra of sn 1999cq , we instead compared it with spectra of the sne ic 1987 m and 1994i that had been corrected by the scattering law .",
    "we find that @xmath48 gives a good fit .",
    "this variation of the exponent in the scattering power law is presumably related to the nature of the scattering dust .",
    "the scattering efficiency for particles of a size scale comparable to optical wavelengths decreases with decreasing size ( although it will also decrease for particles much larger than optical wavelengths , eventually producing grey extinction ) , but the shape and composition of the particles has a significant enough effect on scattering to preclude much speculation regarding the nature of the dust ( e.g. , yanamandra - fisher & hanner 1999 ) .",
    "as reddening is , in practice , the inverse process to scattering , a more likely solution related to environmental effects is a lack of extinction for sn 1999cq . both sn 1994i and sn 1987 m were considerably reddened . for sn",
    "1994i , ho & filippenko ( 1995 ) found @xmath49 mag ( assuming @xmath16 = @xmath50 = 3.0 ) from high - resolution studies of the  d lines , but they considered @xmath51 mag a more likely limit ; this is also the value iwamoto et al .",
    "( 1994 ) found from light - curve studies .",
    "filippenko , porter , & sargent ( 1990 ) estimated the reddening of sn 1987 m to be @xmath24 mag .",
    "the spectrum of sn 1995f in figure 3 also shows a strong  d absorption feature ( ew @xmath52  ) that implies an @xmath53 mag from the barbon et al .",
    "( 1990 ) relation . dereddening these sne using the extinction correction of cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) , with the odonnell ( 1994 ) modifications at blue wavelengths , results in spectra that effectively match the ones produced by correcting with the previously described scattering law ( figure 4 ) .    as mentioned above , the intrinsic reddening of sn 1999cq is highly uncertain .",
    "the 1@xmath19 upper limit for @xmath54 of 0.45 mag is reasonable when compared with other sne ic . a more quantitative estimate , using techniques to be described elsewhere ( leonard et al . , in preparation ) , is that the ew is consistent with zero , but with a 1@xmath19 uncertainty of 0.97  .",
    "thus the reddening of @xmath55 mag is probably an overestimate , with @xmath56 being more likely .",
    "given how well the dereddened spectra of other sne ic match sn 1999cq , it is plausible that it is not significantly reddened .",
    "we believe that what appears to be an anomalous level of blue emission might actually represent the true spectrum of an unreddened sn ic , perhaps with unusually strong emission since sn 1999cq was such a luminous event . without a reliable estimate of the extinction ,",
    "though , this conclusion is highly uncertain .",
    "spectra of sn 1999cq reveal significant emission at blue wavelengths in excess of what is observed in other sne ic .",
    "any interpretation of this emission is strongly dependent on the intrinsic reddening of sn 1999cq .",
    "if we assume sn 1999cq suffers little reddening , then its spectra are indicators of the relative significance of blue emission , presumably iron and iron - group lines , in sne ic",
    ". the blue emission would contribute almost equally with the standard red nebular lines ( [ ] , [ ] , and ) , in contrast to typical sne ic .",
    "if sn 1999cq is as reddened as sne ic usually are , then the alternative solution for the excess blue emission of unusually strong iron and iron - group element emission would be just as interesting , with potential implications for the mixing of @xmath6ni into the outer parts of the progenitor and/or the total amount of @xmath6ni produced by the explosion .",
    "the detailed nature of the mixing of nickel must be understood to see if mixing models can actually produce the difference between sne ib and sne ic .",
    "if the helium is not present , mixing could still occur , but then the abundance of helium is the critical factor in determining whether or not the core collapse of a stripped star is observed as a sn ib or a sn ic .",
    "we have also discovered emission lines with an intermediate velocity width in sn 1999cq , a sn ic .",
    "since such intermediate - width lines likely indicate the interaction of the sn ejecta with dense material lost from the progenitor star , we believe this provides evidence of an almost pure helium wind or mass transfer . if this is the case , then the mechanism that differentiates sne ib and ic is similar to the mass loss or transfer that transforms a type ii core - collapse sn into a type ib / c .",
    "the lines in sn 1999cq have the signature of dense mass loss of a helium envelope , which would not be expected if differing degrees of mixing of @xmath6ni into the ejecta were the sole criterion for the difference between sne ib and ic .",
    "sn 1999cq does not show a direct transformation such as that of sn 1987k , sn 1993j , or sn 1996cb , but , in the lines , we may be seeing a reflection of the last step in the process that creates the progenitors of sne ic .",
