    "<S> pressure - induced superconductivity was recently discovered in the binary helimagnet cras . </S>",

    "<S> the large internal field remaining in the phase - separated hm state indicates that the hm phase disappears through a strong first - order transition . </S>",

    "<S> the absence of a coherence effect in @xmath1 in the superconducting state provides evidence that cras is the first cr - based unconventional superconductor .    in a conventional bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) superconductor , electrons form cooper pairs through negative interactions via an electron - phonon coupling </S>",
    "<S> this gives a sign - uniform @xmath2-wave character to the superconducting ( sc ) gap symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> if positive interactions work electron pairs to induce superconductivity , unconventional superconductivity with a sign - changing order parameter is realized beyond the well - established simple @xmath2 wave . </S>",
    "<S> this fascinating form of superconductivity has been discovered in specific materials , such as heavy fermion systems , high-@xmath3 cuprates , organic systems , ruthenate , and recent fe - based superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> a common feature of these materials is that superconductivity appears due to the instability of some degree of freedom , which is mainly induced on the verge of a magnetically ordered phase .    </S>",
    "<S> very recently , wu _ et al . _ and kotegawa _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ independently discovered pressure - induced superconductivity in cras in the vicinity of the helimagnetic ( hm ) phase @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first example of superconductivity found in a cr - based magnetic system . </S>",
    "<S> cras has a mnp - type orthorhombic crystal structure with a @xmath4 space group . </S>",
    "<S> this structure possesses a space - inversion symmetry , but it is locally missing at the cr and as sites , and both of these atoms form a zigzag chain along the @xmath5-axis . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic transition of the first order into a double - helical state occurs at @xmath6 k. this transition is accompanied by a large magnetostriction , and a lowering of the crystal structure symmetry has not been reported @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the propagation vector is incommensurate with @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a unit vector along the @xmath9 axis , and magnetic moments of @xmath10/cr lie in the @xmath11 plane @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the application of pressure drastically suppresses @xmath12 , and the hm phase disappears above a critical pressure of @xmath13 gpa @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> superconductivity appears together with the suppression of the hm phase , showing a maximum sc transition temperature of @xmath14 k at @xmath15 gpa , after which @xmath3 decreases gradually with increasing pressure . </S>",
    "<S> the pressure - temperature phase diagram of cras with a first - order magnetic transition is reminiscent of those of some pressure - induced fe - based superconductors , such as srfe@xmath16as@xmath16 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic interactions are conjectured to play a crucial role in the induction of superconductivity in cras . </S>",
    "<S> experimental investigation is desired to elucidate how sc symmetry is realized in cras .    here </S>",
    "<S> , we report the results of nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) measurements under ambient and high pressures to elucidate the underling electronic correlations and sc symmetry in cras . from the nuclear spin relaxation rate @xmath1 , we obtained a strong suggestion that the superconductivity realized under moderate magnetic fluctuations of cras is of an unconventional nature .    </S>",
    "<S> single crystals of cras were prepared by the sn - flux method as described in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the nqr measurements under pressure were performed by using a piston - cylinder cell and daphne 7474 as the pressure - transmitting medium @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the applied pressure was estimated from the @xmath17 of the lead manometer . </S>",
    "<S> several as - grown single crystals were put into the pressure cell , and nqr measurements were performed by using the conventional spin - echo method for the @xmath18as nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath19he cryostat was utilized to perform nqr measurement at low temperatures . to obtain @xmath20 in the paramagnetic ( pm ) state , </S>",
    "<S> the recovery curves obtained at the ( @xmath21 ) transition are fitted by a single exponential function .    as nucleus at ambient pressure . </S>",
    "<S> the complicated spectrum at 5 k can be almost reproduced by a model based on the hm state reported by previous neutron scattering measurements , as shown by the red curve . </S>",
    "<S> the crystal and magnetic structures are shown . </S>",
    "<S> the as site is surrounded by six neighboring cr sites composed of three inequivalent sites for the as site . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows the temperature dependence of @xmath22 at the as site , which decreased gradually with increasing temperature and remained large at @xmath12 due to the first - order transition . ]    </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 shows the @xmath18as nqr- or the so - called zero - field nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr)-spectra in the hm state at ambient pressure , where the energy levels of the nuclear spins are mainly lifted by the internal field . because the nuclear spin of @xmath18as is @xmath23 , and because all the as sites in the crystal are equivalent to each other , three transitions were expected for a commensurate magnetic structure , whereas complicated spectra composed of six peaks were obtained at both 5 and 100 k. each peak being not well separated suggests the presence of a spatial modulation of the internal field at the as sites . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , previous neutron scattering measurements have shown that the magnetic structure is incommensurate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> because the measurements also showed that the magnetic moments lay in the @xmath11 plane , we performed a simulation based on this magnetic structure ; that is , we assumed that the internal field @xmath22 at the as site lies in the @xmath11 plane through dominant isotropic hyperfine coupling between the cr moments and the as nuclei . because of the incommensurate structure of the cr moments , the direction of the @xmath22 rotates in the respective as sites </S>",
    "<S> the efg parameter at the as site in the hm state is unknown ; however , crystallographically , one of the principal axes is restricted to be along the @xmath24 axis . through trial and error </S>",
    "<S> , we obtained the red curve to reproduce the experimental result , where the distribution of @xmath25 was considered by a convolution of a lorentzian whose width @xmath26 mhz . </S>",
    "<S> the result gave the quadrupole frequency as @xmath27 mhz , the asymmetry parameter as @xmath28 , @xmath29 t along the @xmath5-axis , and @xmath30 t along the @xmath24 axis . </S>",
    "<S> the direction of the first principal axis of the efg , @xmath31 , was tilted from @xmath5 axis towards the @xmath9 axis at 29.8@xmath32 , and the third principal axis lay along the @xmath24 axis . </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropy of @xmath22 in the @xmath11 plane is considered to originate in the small anisotropy of the hyperfine coupling constant . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows the temperature dependence of @xmath33 , which is estimated from the peak frequency @xmath34 at @xmath35 mhz through @xmath36 , where @xmath37 mhz / t is a gyromagnetic ratio for the as nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> the shift of 0.41 mhz is a contribution from the quadrupole interaction , which is small compared with @xmath22 and assumed to be independent of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath22 decreases gradually with increasing temperature and vanishes suddenly at @xmath12 because of a first - order phase transition .    </S>",
    "<S> , the signal from the hm phase is suppressed and the new signal corresponding to the pm phase appears , indicating that the phase separation between the hm and pm phases occurs in the vicinity of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity of the hm phase at 0.74 gpa is @xmath38 times smaller than that at 0.53 gpa . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows the pressure dependence of @xmath22 , which has a large value on the border of the hm - pm transition as well as the case of the temperature dependence shown in the inset in fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> the dotted line represents @xmath0 , as determined by resistivity measurement @xcite . ]    </S>",
    "<S> figure 2 shows the pressure dependence of zero - field nmr and nqr spectra measured at 5 k. the spectrum is remarkably broadened under pressure , probably owing to a distribution of the efg , but the spectral shape remains similar . </S>",
    "<S> there is no clear signature of a change in the magnetic structure under pressure . </S>",
    "<S> the overall spectrum moves to the low - frequency side with increasing pressure due to a reduction of @xmath22 . at 0.74 gpa , the intensity of the hm state </S>",
    "<S> is drastically suppressed , whereas another sharp spectrum corresponding to the pm state appears at @xmath39 mhz , which is the ( @xmath21 ) transition . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath40 in the pm state is unknown , the @xmath25 is estimated to be in the range between @xmath41 ( for @xmath42 ) and @xmath43 mhz ( for @xmath44 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath25 in the pm state is about twice larger than that in the hm state , owing to the large change in the crystal structure and the possible change in the fermi surface @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we observed simultaneously the spectra for both the hm and pm states at 0.74 gpa , giving microscopic evidence of a phase separation . </S>",
    "<S> we did not observe the signal from the hm state at 0.81 gpa ; thus , the homogeneous pm phase was realized above approximately 0.8 gpa . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows the pressure dependence of @xmath22 , which is estimated from the peak frequency by the same procedure as that in the inset in fig .  1 by assuming the small quadrupole contribution is unchanged under pressure . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath22 gradually decreases under pressure and maintains a large value even in the vicinity of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we can not estimate the accurate ordered moment under pressure , because the pressure dependence of the hyperfine coupling constant is uncertain ; however , the large @xmath22 in the vicinity of @xmath0 indicates that the hm - pm transition at low temperatures is of strong first order . </S>",
    "<S> our observations suggest that cras does not possess a quantum critical point ( qcp ) , which is a continuous phase transition at 0 k , on the pressure - temperature phase diagram .     in the pm state , where superconductivity occurs . </S>",
    "<S> the increase in @xmath45 toward low temperatures demonstrates the development of magnetic fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows the same data between 0.81 and 2.53 gpa in a logarithmic scale . even at 0.81 gpa </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath45 deviates from the behavior expected at a qcp below @xmath46 k. the characteristic temperature @xmath47 was determined from an intersection point of each extrapolation from the low - temperature and high - temperature sides , as shown for the data at 1.59 gpa . ]    </S>",
    "<S> figure 3 shows the temperature dependence of @xmath45 in the pm phase under pressure . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath45 is almost constant for temperatures from @xmath48 to @xmath49 k and increases toward lower temperatures below @xmath50 k. the deviation from fermi liquid ( fl ) behavior of @xmath51 below @xmath50 k clearly demonstrates the presence of magnetic correlations developing toward lower temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the enhancement of @xmath45 toward low temperatures has been observed in other @xmath52-electron superconductors adjoining magnetic phases such as cobalt oxyhydrate @xcite and many fe - based superconductors @xcite . in such itinerant magnetic systems , @xmath45 is generally composed of two contributions as follows : @xmath53 here , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are temperature - independent constants . </S>",
    "<S> the first term is given by spin correlations developing at a specific wave vector . in a self - consistent renormalization theory @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the 3d ferromagnetic and 2d antiferromagnetic correlations give @xmath56 , and the 3d antiferromagnetic case gives @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath58 means that the system is located at a qcp . </S>",
    "<S> the second term is obtained from a uniform susceptibility and from a relaxation through orbital angular momentum , which are both related to the density of states at the fermi level and are independent of temperature in typical metals . in cobalt oxyhydrate @xcite and some fe - based superconductors @xcite , low @xmath59s close to zero are obtained , suggesting that these systems are located in the vicinity of the quantum criticality . unlike these systems </S>",
    "<S> , however , the above form can not reproduce @xmath45 for cras in a wide temperature range down to @xmath3 because the increase of @xmath45 is suppressed at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the low @xmath59 can not be obtained in cras from fitting for the data at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the curves shown in the inset in a logarithmic scale were obtained from the fitting the data at 0.81 gpa in a high - temperature range of @xmath60 k with fixing @xmath58 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we can not determine @xmath61 from this fitting , but both curves reproduce the data well above @xmath46 k. if the system is close to a qcp , @xmath45 should obey these curves , but the deviations are clear at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of @xmath45 below @xmath62 k is weak and close to a constant at 0.81 gpa . </S>",
    "<S> the clear fl behavior above 1.59 gpa suggests that the suppression of @xmath45 corresponds to a crossover behavior from a high - temperature curie - weiss or non - fermi liquid ( nfl ) regime to a low - temperature fl regime . </S>",
    "<S> we determined the characteristic temperature of the crossover @xmath47 from an intersection point of each extrapolation from the low - temperature and high - temperature sides . </S>",
    "<S> figure 4 shows the pressure - temperature phase diagram of cras , where @xmath12 , @xmath3 , and @xmath47 are plotted . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath47 increases with increasing pressure , and the fl state is stable under higher pressures . </S>",
    "<S> a finite @xmath47 in the vicinity of @xmath0 suggests the absence of a qcp in cras . </S>",
    "<S> superconductivity is gradually suppressed with increasing pressure , accompanied by the suppression of the magnetic fluctuations .     and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 are taken from ref.@xcite and supplemental material . </S>",
    "<S> the closed ( open ) squares represent @xmath12 obtained during the cooling ( warming ) process . </S>",
    "<S> these observations of hysteresis and the present nqr spectrum evidence that the hm - pm transition is of the first order in all pressure - temperature ranges . even in the vicinity of @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> the system is close to the fl at low temperatures . ]     below 5 k measured under a zero field . </S>",
    "<S> the clear reduction in @xmath45 is observed below @xmath63 k , which is determined by the change in the resonance frequency shown in fig .  4 ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the green curve indicates a calculation based on a conventional bcs , whereas the red curve indicates one based on a line - node model ( polar type ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath45 is clearly reproduced by the unconventional model . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) temperature dependence of @xmath1 at 0.81 gpa . the red curve based on the line - node model is also plotted . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of @xmath1 is close to @xmath64 below @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> ]    now , we discuss @xmath1 in the sc state . </S>",
    "<S> figure 5(a ) shows the temperature dependence of @xmath45 below 5 k measured at 0.81 gpa . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of the change in the resonance frequency measured by an @xmath65-@xmath66 nmr coil is also shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 5(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> it clearly shows a diamagnetic signal below @xmath63 k. below @xmath3 , @xmath45 shows a clear reduction without the signature of a coherence peak ( hebel - slichter peak ) , which is a marker of a bcs superconductor @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the green curve in the figure indicates calculated @xmath45 for a conventional bcs model , which has an isotropic gap of @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> evidently this does not match the experimental result below @xmath3 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the red curve indicates calculated @xmath45 for a line - node model [ polar type ; @xmath68 with @xmath69 and reproduce the data well , meaning that the coherence effect is completely absent in cras and suggesting strongly that superconductivity is not of the conventional bcs but unconventional in nature . </S>",
    "<S> cras is the first example of unconventional superconductivity seen in cr - based systems .    here , we used a polar - type line - node model as a simple example , which gives @xmath70 dependence in @xmath1 at low temperatures , but the sc gap function is not restricted by the present experiment . </S>",
    "<S> for example , sign - changing nodeless @xmath71-wave symmetry is considered to be realized in some of the fe - based multigap superconductors , and this symmetry can reproduce the @xmath70 dependence of @xmath1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , our band calculation , shown in supplemental material , suggests that the fermi surface of cras is composed of several sheets . </S>",
    "<S> the present nqr results strongly suggest that a sign in the sc gap must change somewhere in the momentum space ; thus , the possibility of a nodeless gap can not be excluded .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we performed nqr measurements on pressure - induced superconductor cras . </S>",
    "<S> the phase separation between the hm and pm phases in the vicinity of @xmath0 and the insensitivity of @xmath22 against pressure provide microscopic evidence of strong first - order hm - pm transition at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> although this indicates that cras does not possess a qcp , @xmath45 in the pm state increases significantly from 100 to @xmath46 k , suggesting that substantial magnetic fluctuations remain in the pm phase . below @xmath46 </S>",
    "<S> k , @xmath45 approaches the fl behavior , and superconductivity sets in . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath45 does not show a coherence peak , and decreases sharply below @xmath3 , giving a clear indication that superconductivity in cras is of an unconventional nature . </S>",
    "<S> this first example of unconventional superconductivity in a cr - based system opens a new route to the development of the field of superconductivity . </S>"
