    "accurate knowledge of the population ii distance scale is one of the most important goals in astronomy . upon it depends , for instance , the determination of the ages of globular clusters ( gc s ) , and thus of a firm lower limit to the age of the universe .",
    "rr lyrae variables are the natural pop .",
    "ii  standard candle . \"",
    "several methods have been devised to estimate their luminosities , but a consensus has not yet been reached . in particular , there appears to be a  dichotomy \" between  faint \" ( i.e. , short distance scale and old ages for the gc s ) and  bright \" ( long distance scale and younger gc ages ) calibrations . walker ( 1992 ) and catelan ( 1996 ) provide useful references covering the literature as of 1995 .",
    "but the noted  dichotomy \" has become even more clear - cut recently .",
    "ground - based investigations have continued to appear supporting either the  short \" or the  long \" scale .",
    "examples of the former include the baade - wesselink ( e.g. , clementini et al .",
    "1995 ) and statistical parallaxes ( layden et al . 1996 ; popowski & gould 1998 ) analyses of field rr lyraes . an example of the latter has been provided by the extensive analysis of the variables in m15 by silbermann & smith ( 1995 ) .",
    "the  persistent \" nature of such a  dichotomy \" has led some authors ( e.g. , vandenberg , bolte , & stetson 1996 ; sweigart 1998 ) to speculate that _ there might exist a real difference in luminosity between field and cluster rr lyrae variables_. that was based in part on the ( somewhat uncertain ) baade - wesselink results of storm , carney , & latham ( 1994 ) for a few rr lyrae variables in the gc s m5 and m92 and field counterparts of comparable metallicity .",
    "these speculations notwithstanding , there has been widespread belief that , once the _ hipparcos _ satellite parallax results became available , we would finally be able to decide between the  short \" and  long \" rr lyrae distance scales .",
    "however , that turned out _ not _ to be the case . based upon",
    "_ hipparcos _ parallaxes of field subdwarfs and main - sequence fitting to gc s with well - defined deep color - magnitude diagrams , gratton et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and reid ( 1997 , 1998 ) have strongly claimed that the majority of the gc s in their samples are substantially farther away than previously estimated using ground - based parallaxes ( but see pont et al .",
    "similarly , mcnamara ( 1997b ) has concluded that the _ hipparcos _ parallaxes of field sx phoenicis variables favor the  long \" gc distance scale .",
    "these claims were supported by _",
    "data for cepheids ( feast & catchpole 1997 ; madore & freedman 1997 ; see also the latest ground - based results by laney 1998 ) and miras ( van leeuwen et al . 1997 ) , applied to the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "the  long \" distance to the lmc is supported by the latest analysis of the sn1987a ring ( panagia , gilmozzi , & kirshner 1998 ; but see gould & uza 1998 ) . on the other hand , gratton ( 1998 )",
    "has analyzed _ hipparcos _ data for field horizontal - branch ( hb ) stars including three rr lyrae variables , and found that the faint hb luminosity scale was preferred .",
    "fernley et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and tsujimoto , miyamoto , & yoshii ( 1998 ) have also reported , based on _ hipparcos _ data for field rr lyraes , luminosities which are consistent with the corresponding ground - based analyses . as argued by gratton , _",
    "the hipparcos results thus seem to favor the existence of an intrinsic difference in luminosity ( by @xmath0  mag ) between gc and field rr lyraes_.    however , no independent tests have thus far been applied to verify this . as is well known , _",
    "rr lyrae pulsation properties depend strongly on their luminosities_. the purpose of this _ letter _ is to employ such properties to constrain the difference in luminosity between field and gc variables .",
    "_ only gc s and field stars analyzed with hipparcos will be covered .",
    "_ we begin in sec .  2 by discussing the employed methods for deriving rr lyrae temperatures . in sec .  3 ,",
    "the selection criteria we have adopted are described . in sec .  4",
    ", we demonstrate that gc variables do not show substantial period shifts with respect to field variables of similar metallicity , as opposed to what would be expected if there were an intrinsic luminosity difference between them .",
    "finally , our results are critically discussed in sec .  5 .",
    "in their baade - wesselink analysis of field rr lyraes , carney et al .",
    "( 1992a , hereafter csj92 ) compiled parameters for a number of variables , including temperatures derived from near - infrared colors .",
    "analyzing possible correlations in their database , they concluded that a simple equation exists [ their eq .",
    "( 16 ) ] relating the  equilibrium temperature \" @xmath1 , blue amplitudes @xmath2 , pulsation periods @xmath3 , and metallicities [ fe / h ] for ab - type rr lyraes .",
    "this relationship formed the basis for their discussion of the period - shift effect , and will be adopted here as a first means of estimating temperatures .",
    "catelan et al .",
    "( 1998 , hereafter csb98 ) have recently reanalyzed temperatures based on the csj92 data .",
    "they argued that a relationship involving only @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and [ fe / h ] would be safer to adopt in period - shift analyses than csj92 s ( sec .",
    "2.1 ) , since period shifts caused by luminosity variations could easily be misinterpreted as being due to temperature variations .",
    "the idea of employing @xmath2 values to determine @xmath1 ( cf .",
    "sandage 1981a , b ) is supported by jones et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , who state that  @xmath4  at a fixed metallicity ,",
    "it is likely that _ relative _ @xmath2 values are reliable indicators of _ relative _ temperatures . \"",
    "we have rederived the csb98 relationship for @xmath1 for the same selection criteria and parameters used in our period - shift analysis of the _ hipparcos _ sample ( sec .  3 ) .",
    "thus , the star sw  and was also removed from the csj92 database , because it presents the blazhko effect .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath2 values from blanco ( 1992 ) were adopted .",
    "( the differences are generally small , with the exception of dx  del , for which blanco s @xmath2 is larger by @xmath5  mag . )",

    "1 shows that this relationship does provide a superb match to the csj92 equilibrium temperatures .",
    "in the present section , we lay out the selection criteria employed in our analysis .",
    "we have retrieved the list of 125 variables employed by tsujimoto et al .",
    "( 1998 ) in their _ hipparcos_-based analysis of field rr lyraes , as kindly supplied by dr .",
    "t. tsujimoto .",
    "we have selected stars from this sample according to the following criteria .",
    "i )  _ reliable classification as ab - type rr lyrae stars _ : variables whose rrab lyrae nature has been questioned by schmidt , chab , & reiswig ( 1995 ) or fernley & barnes ( 1997 ) were dismissed ; ii )  _ well - behaved light curves _ : stars which blanco ( 1992 ) or schmidt et al . pinpointed as blazhko variables were discarded ; iii )  _ metallicity values available from layden _ : stars for which layden et al . ( 1996 ) do not provide metallicity values were not considered .",
    "we have also removed from the list all variables for which metallicities are based on hemenway s ( 1975 ) measurements , since we consider the corresponding layden et al .",
    "[ fe / h ] values quite uncertain ; iv )  _ blue amplitudes and pulsation periods available from blanco ( 1992)_.      among the 12 gc s which have had distances determined using _ hipparcos _",
    "parallaxes for field subdwarfs , only 5 contain a sufficiently large number of rr lyrae variables to justify their inclusion in the present analysis : ngc  362 , m5 , m68 , m15 , and m92 .",
    "since the layden et al .",
    "( 1996 ) field rr lyrae metallicities are tied in to the zinn & west ( 1984 ) abundance scale , we decided to adopt the [ fe / h ] entries of harris ( 1996 ) catalogue for consistency . although the zinn & west scale has been seriously questioned by gratton et al .",
    "( 1997 and references therein ) , this is of minor relevance for the present purposes , since our goal is to perform a period - shift analysis at _ fixed metallicity_. likewise , the criticism of mcnamara ( 1997a ) of the near - infrared temperatures is of secondary relevance for us .",
    "the adopted sources of information for the gc rr lyrae variables are provided in table  1 , along with the cluster [ fe / h ] and lee - zinn hb morphology parameter ( both from harris 1996 ) . according to such hb types , the only gc for which evolution away from the blue zero - age hb may bias the period - shift analysis is m92 . as with the field star sample , blazhko variables were discarded  as were those suspected to be non - cluster members .",
    "table  1 shows that our gc sample divides into two metallicity bins , with @xmath10 } \\approx -1.2 $ ] and @xmath11 .",
    "we have thus split the comparison between gc and field variables into two metallicity regimes . for the more metal - rich end , we employ all field rr lyraes ( 25 stars ) falling in the range @xmath12 } \\leq -0.95 $ ] which have passed our selection criteria ( sec .  3.1 ) ; at the metal - poor end , we restrict the sample to the variables with @xmath10 } \\leq -1.85 $ ] ( 10 stars ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath13 diagrams using temperatures derived as in sec .",
    "2.1 and sec .",
    "2.2 are shown in figs .  2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "the scatter is substantially larger in fig .  3 than in fig .",

    "( 1 ) does not have this bias , being more suitable for detecting luminosity variations at a given @xmath1 .",
    "consider , for instance , v9 in 47  tuc ( @xmath15  d ) , which is brighter than field rr lyraes of similar metallicity by @xmath16  mag ( cf . fig .",

    "pulsation models show temperatures to be quite insensitive to @xmath19 at fixed _ blue _ amplitude over a range in @xmath20 of 0.75  mag and for @xmath21 .",
    "in addition , ss  leo , which has ill - determined physical parameters , was not discarded by csj92 when deriving their eq .",
    "( 16 ) . excluding this star from the csj92 sample , we find a reduction in the @xmath22 coefficient of their eq .",
    "( 16 ) by @xmath23  a factor of two , and an increase ( in absolute value ) in the corresponding @xmath2 coefficient by a similar factor .",

    "show that _ there is no detectable difference in period - shift properties between the studied field and cluster rr lyraes , either at the metal - poor or at the more metal - rich end_irrespective of the approach used to estimate @xmath1 .",
    "if gratton s ( 1998 ) suggestion were correct and the gc variables were brighter by @xmath0  mag , we would expect to see a difference as large as @xmath27 at fixed @xmath1 between gc and field stars ( catelan 1996 ) , which is most decidedly _ not _ present in our diagrams .",
    "other interesting conclusions that may be drawn from figs .  2 and 3 , but which we shall not discuss in the present _ letter _ , are : i )  there seems to be no offset in the @xmath28 diagrams between gc s with widely different hb types but similar [ fe / h ] ( cf .",
    "catelan 1994 ) ; ii )  metal - poor rrab lyraes may have a cooler @xmath1 cutoff than the metal - rich ones ( sandage 1993 ) ; iii )  there may be an offset of @xmath29 at constant @xmath1 ( @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 mag for fixed mass ) between the metal - poor and the more metal - rich rr lyraes .",
    "_ the present analysis does not substantiate gratton s ( 1998 ) suggestion , based on hipparcos results , that there is a difference in luminosity between gc and field rr lyrae variables _ , showing instead that they have essentially the same distribution in the @xmath28 plane , both at the metal - poor and at the more metal - rich ends .",
    "does this imply that there is really _ no _ difference between gc and field hb stars ?",
    "not necessarily .",

    "1994 and layden 1995 ) .",
    "moreover , it should be noted that : i )  the @xmath33 diagram ( and possibly even spectroscopically - derived metallicities ) may be sensitive to the helium abundance @xmath34 , so that an additional , @xmath34-dependent term may be needed to put eq .",
    "( 1 ) on a firmer basis ( csb98 ) . in any case , available models suggest that it would not be possible for differences in @xmath34 between field and gc stars to be consistent with both a luminosity difference of @xmath0  mag and the remarkable overlapping in the @xmath28 plane found in figs .  2 and 3 ; ii )  as well known , field red giants do not seem to show signatures of non - canonical deep mixing , whereas some gc s do ( cf .",
    "kraft et al . 1997 ) .",
    "it might be worth examining whether rr lyrae temperatures and amplitudes might be sensitive to their ( inherited ) abundance anomalies ; iii )  as pointed out by sweigart ( 1998 ) , the stars which are more likely to be affected by  helium mixing \" during the red giant branch phase are the blue - hb and extreme - hb stars , not the cooler rr lyraes .",
    "the present results ( see also fernley 1993 ) provide motivation for searching for systematic errors in methods employed to estimate the distances of gc s ( esp .",
    "main - sequence fitting ) and the luminosities of rr lyrae stars ( esp .",
