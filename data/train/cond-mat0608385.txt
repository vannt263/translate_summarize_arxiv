    "quartz tuning forks are commercially produced piezoelectric oscillators meant to be used as frequency standards in watches .",
    "an extensive literature describes their use for a large number of other additional applications.@xcite they have also been employed in liquid he temperature measurements.@xcite this study was inspired by the expectation that industrially produced quartz oscillators , with a calibrated standard frequency of @xmath6hz ) at room temperature , would be reasonably identical and could be used as secondary thermometers without need for recalibration .",
    "we have performed measurements on four different forks of identical dimensions , but produced by different manufacturers .",
    "it turns out that without preselection at lhe temperatures the results can not be reduced on a common temperature dependence .",
    "for instance , the resonance width @xmath7 measured in vacuum below 1.5k proved to be 0.06hz , 0.5hz , 1.4hz , and 0.06hz for these four sensors .",
    "this measure of the intrinsic dissipation , which limits the response of the device to its environment at the lowest temperatures , can not be determined from room temperature measurements .",
    "it remains to be seen if simple preselection criteria can be worked out , to narrow down the variation in oscillator characteristics .",
    "however , the quartz tuning fork offers other important advantages as a sensor of its cryogenic environment .",
    "forks are cheap and readily available , they are robust and as such easy to install and to use , they operate at a higher frequency than most other vibrating sensors , and they are highly sensitive indicators of the physical properties of the medium in which they are immersed . thus they provide handy _ in situ _ information about the conditions in a sample container at the far end of a low - conductance filling line , which is helpful during flushing , filling , emptying , and in general , for reproducible monitoring of pressure and temperature changes .",
    "a major advantage in many applications is that to drive these piezoelectric devices no magnetic fields are needed and that they , in fact , are highly insensitive to them.@xcite    in this report we explore the linear response of the quartz tuning fork in he liquids at low excitation , in the regime of viscous hydrodynamics .",
    "the purpose is to compare the measurements to a hydrodynamic model which could explain the measured results . for this sec .",

    "3 the influence of the surrounding medium is incorporated , sec .  4 discusses briefly the practical measurement , and later sections describe the measured results in vacuum as well as in @xmath4he and @xmath5he liquids , by comparing the data to the physical model .",
    "we postpone to a later occasion the analysis of nonlinear effects and of the lowest temperatures with collisionless motion of excitations .",
    "this latter aspect , the creation and detection of excitations and of quantized vortices in the @xmath8 temperature limit , is of great current interest . a large amount of new information has been discovered on vortex properties using vibrating resonators : ( i ) spheres,@xcite grids,@xcite and wires@xcite in @xmath5he - ii , ( ii ) grids@xcite and wires@xcite in @xmath4he - b , and ( iii ) wires@xcite in @xmath4he@xmath5he mixtures .",
    "one might hope that the quartz tuning fork could be used for similar measurements .",
    "at sufficiently small oscillation amplitudes the fork can be described as a harmonic oscillator subject to a harmonic driving force @xmath9 and a drag force with linear dependence on velocity .",
    "the equation of motion is given by @xmath10 we have here four parameters , namely the effective mass @xmath11 ( of one leg ) , the drag coefficient @xmath12 , the spring constant @xmath13 , and the amplitude of the driving force @xmath14 .",
    "the effective mass and the drag coefficient depend on the medium around the oscillating fork .",
    "the solution of this differential equation is well known : it can be written as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the absorption and dispersion , respectively .",
    "the mean absorbed power @xmath18 is at maximum at the resonant frequency @xmath19 it is convenient to introduce the quality factor @xmath20 as the ratio of the resonant frequency @xmath21 to the frequency width @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the full width of the resonance curve at half of the maximum power .",

    "we find @xmath38n / m and @xmath39 @xmath40 kg .",
    "this gives @xmath41hz , which is 11% larger than the manufactured value of 32768hz at room temperature .",
    "the discrepancy with the theoretical expression is most likely due to additional weight of the evaporated electrodes , dependence of the elasticity modulus of quartz on the orientation with respect to the crystallographic axes , and deviations in geometry between the real fork and the model .",
    "at room temperature in vacuum the measured width of the absorption curve at half power is typically @xmath42hz , which gives @xmath43 . in room air",
    "the width increases to @xmath44hz . with decreasing temperature the resonant frequency diminishes and the @xmath1 value increases .",

    "in this section we outline the basic properties of the oscillatory boundary layer flows , to understand how the vibrating fork works as a detector .",

    "[ he3norm ] show opposite behavior .",
    "since these have been performed with different sensors , the possibility remains at this point that the main part of the temperature independent width in normal liquid @xmath4he depends on the fork with which it is measured .",
    "several reports on vibrating wire measurements mention a viscosity anomaly in normal @xmath4he : an unexpected reduction in the viscosity close to @xmath149 from the @xmath172 behavior.@xcite our data show no sign of this anomaly : the width @xmath128 changes exactly proportional to @xmath173 until @xmath149 ( fig .",
