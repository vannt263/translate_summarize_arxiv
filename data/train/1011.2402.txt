    "miscible polymer blends exhibit dynamic disparity . by starting from two homopolymers with different mobilities ,",
    "two separated segmental relaxations are still found in the blend state @xcite .",
    "when the two homopolymers exhibit very different glass transition temperatures , and the concentration of the fast component is low , the respective time scales in the blend can differ by orders of magnitude , leading to strong dynamic asymmetry @xcite .",
    "this effect is enhanced on decreasing the temperature , and can be of even 12 decades for high dilution of poly(ethylene oxide ) ( peo ) in poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( pmma ) @xcite . in conditions of strong dynamic asymmetry ,",

    "moreover , the rouse modes of the peo chains exhibit anomalous behaviour @xcite ( see below ) .",
    "all these observations have also been found in simulations of a simple blend of bead - spring chains with strong dynamic asymmetry @xcite , suggesting that they are generic features of real blends .",
    "the simple bead - spring chains of the blends investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite are fully - flexible .",
    "no intramolecular barriers are implemented .",
    "the chain length , @xmath0 , in all the investigated cases is smaller than the entanglement value . in such conditions , the simulations for the homopolymer system are consistent with expectations from the rouse model @xcite",
    "this is also the case for the slow component in the blend state @xcite .",
    "however a rather different scenario is found for the fast component in the blend @xcite , which only shows rouse dynamics for vanishing dynamic asymmetry .",
    "increasing the latter ( by decreasing temperature ) induces a progressive deviation from rouse - like behaviour for _ dynamic _ observables of the fast component .",
    "these include intrinsic non - exponentiality of the rouse modes and anomalous scaling of the corresponding relaxation times , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the mode index . on increasing the dynamic asymmetry the exponent increases from the rouse prediction , @xmath3 , to values @xmath4 .",
    "the origin of these features is dynamic . indeed",
    "the static amplitudes of the rouse modes are not affected by blending , and show gaussian , rouse - like , scaling as in the homopolymer state @xcite .",
    "the mentioned dynamic crossover , on increasing the dynamic asymmetry , from @xmath5 to @xmath6 in the _ non - entangled _ fast component is strikingly similar to that observed for entangled homopolymers on increasing the mode wavelength , @xmath7 , beyond the entanglement length @xcite .",
    "the crossover for the fast component in the blend is observed even in the limit of short chains .",
    "thus , it was concluded that this feature is entirely controlled by the dynamic asymmetry in the blend , and not by a characteristic length scale @xcite .",
    "related observations have been presented by simulations of short fully - flexible chains in matrixes of fixed obstacles @xcite .",
    "rouse modes were not analyzed but a crossover , similar to the observation in homopolymers on increasing @xmath0 , was found .",

    "theories based on generalized langevin equations ( gle ) introduce a memory kernel accounting for the slow relaxation of density fluctuations around the tagged chain @xcite . the rouse model , which neglects memory effects , arises from such theories in the limit of fast relaxation of the kernel @xcite .",
    "memory effects are enhanced on increasing the chain length beyond the entanglement value , and the theory reproduces non - exponentiality and anomalous scaling of the rouse modes in entangled homopolymers @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that gle methods may also account for the analogous dynamic features exhibited by the non - entangled fast component in polymer blends @xcite , through the incorporation in the kernel of the memory effects induced by the matrix , formed by the slow component in the blend or by the fixed obstacles in the systems of refs",
    ".  @xcite .    as mentioned above , the simulations of refs .",
    "@xcite were performed for fully - flexible chains . in this article",
    "we briefly review the results of @xcite and present new results for blends where the fast component is semiflexible , i.e. , it has intramolecular barriers .",
    "these are introduced by implementing bending and torsion potentials .",
    "it is well - known that the presence of strong intramolecular barriers violates the rouse assumption of gaussian behaviour for the static and dynamic intrachain correlations .",
    "indeed significant non - rouse effects appear as chains become stiffer @xcite . in the same spirit as the rouse model for fully - flexible chains , phenomenological models for semiflexible polymers",
    "usually model the interactions of the tagged chain with the surroundings by means of a friction term and random forces @xcite .",
    "thus , memory effects induced by slow density fluctuations of the matrix are neglected , and non - rouse effects are of intramolecular origin .",
    "the latter is entirely related to static contributions and the amplitudes and relaxation times of the rouse modes follow the same scaling behaviour @xcite .",
    "the chains studied in this work are semiflexible in the meaning that they can be deformed but , unlike fully - flexible chains , the static intramolecular correlations are strongly non - gaussian within all the chain length scale .",
    "we investigate the effect of blending on the dynamic scenario observed for the semiflexible homopolymer , aiming to discriminate static and dynamic contributions to anomalous chain dynamics in the blend .",
    "we find strong deviations from rouse behaviour .",
    "however , as in the homopolymer state , the amplitudes and relaxation times of the rouse modes follow almost the same scaling behaviour , i.e , in this case the origin of the anomalous , non - rouse , features found for chain dynamics in the blend is esentially static .",
    "we conclude that memory effects induced by the slow matrix are not significant for semiflexible chains in blends , at least for the range of dynamic asymmetry investigated here , and when the chains are non - gaussian over all their length scale .",
    "presumably , memory effects will become relevant in semiflexible chains which are long enough , at large length scales for which intramolecular static correlations recover gaussian statistics .",

    "the selected values of the bending and torsion constants @xmath60 considerably stretch the semiflexible b - chains in comparison with the fully - flexible case .",

    "after the initial ballistic regime , a plateau arises for both components at @xmath71 , and extends over longer time scales on decreasing temperature .",
    "this reflects the usual caging regime observed in glass - forming systems when approaching a glass transition . in analogy with previous observations for the model",
    "i @xcite , there is a progressive separation , on decreasing @xmath46 , of the time scales of the a- and b - monomers .",
    "we quantify the dynamic asymmetry in the blend as the ratio @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the time at which the msd reaches the value @xmath74 .",

    "figure  [ fig : msdasym]b shows the @xmath46-dependence of the dynamic asymmetry , both for models i and ii . in both cases",
    "the dynamic asymmetry becomes stronger on decreasing @xmath46 .",
    "however , this effect is less pronounced in the model ii , which shows a lower @xmath75 than the model i at the same temperature , blend composition and packing fraction .",
    "this is not surprising since the only difference between both models is the strength of the intramolecular barriers in the b - chains .",
    "thus , dynamics of the b - monomers in the semiflexible homopolymer are strongly slowed down respect to the fully - flexible case @xcite , and blending with the same a - homopolymer leads to a weaker dynamic asymmetry in the model ii .    for times",
    "longer than @xmath73 , the msd of both species exhibits subdiffusive behaviour over several time decades , prior to the final crossover to diffusive behaviour at much longer times .",
    "the subdiffusive regime can be described by an effective power law @xmath76 , with @xmath77 .",

    "this is also the value observed for the fully - flexible a- and b - homopolymers ( not shown ) , and can be easily understood in terms of rouse dynamics .",
    "the value @xmath78 is higher than the rouse exponent @xmath79 , which is the effective value predicted by the rouse model in the limit @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "thus , the former difference is mostly due to the finite size , @xmath81 , of the chains @xcite .",
    "we obtain a similar , almost @xmath46-independent , exponent @xmath82 for the semiflexible b - homopolymer .",
    "this coincidence is probably fortuitous , since the @xmath70-value for the semiflexible homopolymer can not be assigned to rouse dynamics , which does not incorporate semiflexibility .",
    "concerning the exponents for the b - chains _ in the blend _ they exhibit a rather different behaviour in the models i and ii ( see figure  [ fig : msdasym]c ) . in the model",
    "i , the exponent @xmath70 decreases monotonically , taking values much smaller than the @xmath46-independent value @xmath68 found for the fully - flexible b - homopolymer .",
    "this trend reflects the breakdown of the rouse model for the fully - flexible b - chains in the blend , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "this breakdown is also reflected in the anomalous scaling observed for the rouse modes on decreasing @xmath46 ( see below ) .",

    "the dynamic asymmetry at this @xmath46 is the same that in the model i at @xmath84 , for which @xmath70 has decreased by about a 15% from its value at @xmath85 . on the contrary ,",
    "in the model ii it remains , within statistics , constant with a value @xmath82 , as observed for the semiflexible b - homopolymer ( see above ) .       and",

    "we confirm this point by analyzing the relaxation of the internal chain degrees of freedom .",
    "this can be quantified by computing the correlators of the rouse modes .",

    "the first decay , at short times , to the plateau reflects the onset of the caging regime already observed in the msd .",

    "@xcite ) that if the kww time shows rouse scaling , @xmath5 , stretching ( i.e. , @xmath102 ) in @xmath103 esentially arises from a distribution of rouse - like exponential processes ( presumably related to dynamic heterogeneities ) . on the contrary ,",

    "the obtained values of the persistence length change from @xmath127 at high temperatures to @xmath128 at the lowest investigated @xmath46 in the blend .",
    "equation ( 6 ) provides a good description of the data of figure  [ fig : tau - stiff ] in the region @xmath129 , both for the b - homopolymer and for the b - chains in the blend .",
    "the behaviour at smaller wavelengths can not be captured .",
    "presumably this is mostly due to the influence of the torsional terms , which are not accounted for within the approach of refs .",

    "the latter is rouse - like for fully - flexible chains , @xmath5 , and is well described by equation  ( [ eq : tau - stiff ] ) for semiflexible chains .",
    "since the relation @xmath130 is fulfilled , the anomalous ( in the meaning of non - rouse ) scaling of the relaxation times for the semiflexible homopolymers is esentially of static origin .",
    "more specifically , it is a direct consequence of the non - gaussian nature of the static intramolecular correlations .",
    "this is also the case for the semiflexible b - chains in the blend ( model ii ) , for which @xmath130 is maintained , except for short wavelengths ( @xmath121 , see figure  [ fig : tau - stiff]b ) at the lowest investigated temperatures .    according to the approach of refs .",
    "@xcite for semiflexible chains , the rouse correlators @xmath95 decay , as in the rouse model , exponentially .",
    "following the same argumentation as for the fully - flexible case ( see section 3 ) , stretching in @xmath95 arises from a distribution of the predicted exponential processes if the kww times fulfill the relation @xmath130 .",
    "otherwise non - exponentiality is intrinsic .",
    "thus , from data in figure  [ fig : tau - stiff ] , we conclude that non - exponentiality of the rouse modes of the semiflexible chains is intrinsinc only for short wavelengths , in the blend state and at the lowest investigated temperatures .",
    "as shown by the data in figure  [ fig : msdasym]b , the dynamic asymmetry ( @xmath131 ) at the lowest investigated @xmath110 of the model ii , is slightly higher than that of the model i at @xmath109 ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "though the strength of the confinement is esentially the same in both cases , the origin of anomalous chain dynamics seems to be very different . as discussed above , this is of intramolecular and static nature for the semiflexible b - chains of model ii . on the contrary ,",
    "the origin is esentially dynamic for the fully - flexible b - chains of model i , as indicated by the clear breakdown of the relation @xmath133 .",

    "are neglected .",
    "the interactions of the tagged ( gaussian ) chain with the surroundings are simply modelled by a friction term and random forces @xcite .",
    "this markovian approximation is also followed by the approach of harnau and co - workers  @xcite , which just incorporates bending forces in the rouse equations of motion to account for chain stiffness .",
    "the predicted scaling behaviour [ equation ( [ eq : tau - stiff ] ) ] is observed for the semiflexible b - homopolymer and is not signifficantly affected by blending with a slower matrix , suggesting that memory effects are not relevant and the markovian approximation can still be applied in the blend .",
    "it remains to be understood , from a microscopic basis , why memory effects induced by the matrix are apparently much weaker than intramolecular effects induced by the presence of the barriers . on the contrary ,",
    "memory effects are crucial in the case of the fully - flexible b - chains in the blend @xcite , for which predictions of the rouse model are strongly violated .",
    "finally , we want to make a last remark on the dynamics of the semiflexible chains in the blend . as discussed above ,",
    "the semiflexible chains considered here are strongly non - gaussian within all chain length scales .",
    "if longer chains were considered , with the same torsional and bending contributions , the semiflexible character would be lost beyond some mode wavelength , and gaussian statistics would be recovered for intrachain static correlations at large length scales .",
    "we expect that in such length scales , as observed for the fast fully - flexible chains in blends with strong dynamic asymmetry , anomalous dynamic scaling will arise for the rouse modes , distinct from the static gaussian scaling , and memory effects will be relevant .",
    "in fact this seems to be the case for the results reported in ref .",
    "@xcite from atomistic simulations of the dynamically asymmetric blend peo / pmma . there",
    "the relaxation times @xmath98 of the rouse mode correlators of the fast component ( peo ) still exhibit anomalous , non - rouse , @xmath2-scaling at large mode wavelengths @xmath7 for which gaussian behaviour , @xmath136 , is recovered in the mode amplitudes ( see figure 11 in ref .",
    "this would be the general expected behaviour in real blends with strong dynamic asymmetry .",
    "we have performed simulations of a simple model of non - entangled semiflexible chains blended with a slower component . extending previous investigations for fully - flexible chains , we investigate the effect of the dynamic asymmetry in the blend on the relaxation of the semiflexible chains .",
    "we find the same anomalous scaling behaviour for the relaxation times and the static amplitudes of the rouse modes , in agreement with markovian models which extend the rouse equations by the introduction of bending forces .",
    "thus , anomalous dynamic features for the semiflexible chains esentially have a static and intramolecular origin .",
    "this is very different from the case of fully - flexible chains in blends with similar dynamic asymmetry . for the latter anomalous dynamic scaling",
    "is strongly correlated with the dynamic asymmetry , and not to features of the static amplitudes , which indeed still follow gaussian scaling .",
    "the former results suggest that memory effects induced by the surrounding slow matrix are not relevant for non - entangled semiflexible polymers , and markovian models can still be applied .",
    "however , if the chains are long enough , we expect that the influence of the memory effects will be recovered at large length scales where intrachain static correlations recover gaussian statistics .",
    "work in this direction is in progress .",
