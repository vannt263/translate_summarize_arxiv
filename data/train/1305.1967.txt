    "many physical problems can be reduced to considering the rate of transport of volume between different regions of the state space of a hamiltonian system .",
    "such problems arise when studying chemical reaction rates @xcite , capture and escape processes in celestial mechanics @xcite , particle escape from charged particle storage rings @xcite , and displacement of defects in solids @xcite .",
    "the state space volume of interest in these problems is that occupied by a classical ensemble of a low - dimensional dynamical system derived from a `` kinetic approximation '' , i.e. a great number of different , independent realisations of the same hamiltonian system .",
    "since energy is conserved by the systems , it is natural to consider the rate at which energy - surface volume crosses between regions as a function of the energy .",
    "both marcelin ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch.2 ) and later wigner @xcite realised that a natural way to study the rate of transport is to place a _ _ dividing surface _",
    "_ between the regions of interest and consider the flux of energy - surface volume through this surface .",
    "it must divide the whole energy level into two distinct regions , such that no trajectory can pass from one region to the other without crossing it . in this case the flux of energy - surface volume through the dividing surface in one direction gives an upper bound on the rate of transport in this direction . in order to obtain a useful upper bound",
    ", wigner @xcite proposed varying the dividing surface to obtain one with ( locally ) minimal flux .",
    "this variational definition does not determine a unique dividing surface , because one can flow any dividing surface along the vector field and obtain another , but the minimum flux is well defined .",
    "a lot of the initial and subsequent work was done with reaction rates in mind and led to variational transition state theory ( nicely reviewed and put into context by pollak and talkner @xcite ) . in chemical reactions",
    ", one finds the basic transport scenario , which we refer to as `` flux over a saddle '' . here , the two regions of interest represent reactants and products and have an index-1 critical point of the hamiltonian function between them , hence the name . for small energies above that at the critical point ,",
    "the energy level is diffeomorphic to a spherical cylinder and has a bottleneck about the critical point .",
    "the dividing surface is therefore placed in the bottleneck region , thus allowing for a local analysis .",

    "] , closed , codimension-2 submanifold , the _ transition state_. the general picture was given by wigner @xcite .",
    "explicit dividing surfaces spanning a family of unstable periodic orbits were constructed by pechukas in the case of 2 degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "toller et al .",
    "@xcite generalised this to arbitrary degrees of freedom , without however restricting to energy - levels .",
    "these were then considered by mackay @xcite , though for more than 2 degrees of freedom it left too much to the imagination of the reader , which we rectify here .",
    "the construction was rediscovered by wiggins et al .",
    "@xcite , but without explanation of how to pass from the normal form approximations to the full problem .",
    "we are interested in what happens when the energy is increased in the basic scenario and the bottleneck opens up , and also in more general transport problems .",
    "these scenarios will not allow for a local analysis about some critical point , and will involve global dividing surfaces and transition states that may bifurcate leading to other scenarios . for two degree of freedom systems ,",
    "the transition states are hyperbolic periodic orbits .",
    "the bifurcations of such objects are well known and can be found in the literature , e.g. meyer et al .",
    "* ch.11 ) and hanmann ( * ? ? ?",
    "thus , there have been various studies of the bifurcations of periodic orbit transition states in the transition state theory literature , see e.g.  @xcite . for higher degrees of freedom ,",
    "the transition states are normally hyperbolic submanifolds of higher dimensions , e.g.  in the basic scenario we have a @xmath11-sphere .",
    "the bifurcation of such submanifolds is not much explored or understood , even though there have been a few recent studies @xcite .",
    "it has been considered a hard problem because bifurcation necessitates loss of normal hyperbolicity and for submanifolds of dimension 3 or greater there are many possible consequences .",
    "however , what has been overlooked and will be considered here , is that there is a large class of systems for which normal hyperbolicity is regained immediately : the transition state develops singularities at a critical energy , i.e. points at which the manifold structure fails , but regains smoothness and normal hyperbolicity with a change in diffeomorphism type .",
    "the dividing surfaces also undergo a similar bifurcation .",
    "these are _ morse bifurcations_.    section [ review ] is an introduction and review of the dividing surface method for transport problems . after giving the basic definitions",

    "[ transition ] , we give the general definitions and outline the properties of the submanifolds that are needed for the dividing surface method . these generalise the ideas found in the basic scenario .",
    "next , section [ variation ] gives a neat method to construct dividing surfaces about transition states , which uses the normal hyperbolicity of the latter .",
    "this is a necessary step in order to consider more general transport problems .",
    "readers who are already well versed in the subject may skip ahead to section [ bifurcations ] which is where the main contribution of this paper starts .",
    "this contains a discussion on the possible bifurcations of the dividing surfaces and transition states , and then gives some examples of morse bifurcations .",
    "the examples initially have 2 degrees of freedom , such that the morse bifurcations stand out",
    ". however , morse theory , which is briefly reviewed in appendix [ morse ] , applies to manifolds of all dimensions , so there is no limitation to the number of degrees of freedom one can consider . the central role played by morse bifurcations in transport problems",
    "is seen in the application given in section [ bimolecular ] . here",
    ", we find interesting sequences of morse bifurcations and therefore transition states and dividing surfaces , in prototype planar bimolecular reactions . in section",
    "[ conclude ] , we conclude our study of morse bifurcations and discuss the remaining open questions for the dividing surface method . following are three appendices , one on how the flux as a function of energy changes at morse bifurcations , another on approximating normally hyperbolic ( symplectic ) submanifolds and finally one on morse theory .",
    "in order to consider the flow of state space volume between different regions of a hamiltonian system , we start with some definitions and terminology in section [ divsurfs ] .",
    "then , we consider codimension-1 submanifolds of an energy level with locally minimal flux through them , and finally we review the basic transport scenario of flux over a saddle .",

    "we are interested in the flow of state space ( or liouville ) volume @xmath27 in local darboux coordinates @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 . since @xmath16 is conserved by the flow , we can restrict attention to the energy levels @xmath31 and so consider energy - surface volume , @xmath32 , a @xmath33-form on regular @xmath34 ( i.e.  @xmath35 is nowhere zero on @xmath34 ; @xmath36 is said to be a regular value of @xmath16 ) , given by the relation @xmath37    we can now define the ( energy - surface ) _ flux form _ @xmath38 at times , we will also need to consider the state space flux form simply given by @xmath39 finally , the flux of energy - surface volume through a codimension-1 , oriented submanifold @xmath40 of an energy level is the integral @xmath41    we have chosen to use differential forms , but the equation is the same as the usual flux equation @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the unit normal to the surface ( with respect to a riemannian structure ) and @xmath44 an infinitesimal volume element , cf .",
    "keck @xcite .",
    "this is seen by rewriting the flux form as @xmath45 and defining @xmath46 .",
    "see frankel @xcite for more details .",
    "use of a riemannian structure however is an artificial crutch .    evaluating this integral can be simplified by noting that for regular energy levels @xmath34 , the flux form reduces to @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "the symplectic form @xmath15 can , modulo global topological obstructions , be written as @xmath48 , for some 1-form @xmath49 , called the _",
    "action form_. in local darboux coordinates one can take @xmath50 .",
    "this allows us to write @xmath51 with the _ `` generalised '' action form _ @xmath52 .",
    "then , we can use stokes theorem to obtain @xmath53 we state this as    [ fluxstoke ] the flux of energy - surface volume through an oriented codimension-1 submanifold of an energy - level is minus the generalised action integral over its boundary .",
    "in general the flux form @xmath54 evaluated on the tangent space to an oriented surface is not single - signed .",
    "the flow may cross in the positive direction in some parts of @xmath40 and the other way on other parts .",
    "where we want to emphasise this we refer to the flux integral as `` net flux '' .",
    "consider trajectories crossing from a region @xmath55 to another @xmath56 , within an energy level @xmath34 , and imagine a dividing surface somewhere between @xmath55 and @xmath56 , which is crossed by all these trajectories .",
    "the positive part of the flux of energy - surface volume through this surface gives an upper bound on the rate of transport . in order to obtain a useful bound on the transport",
    ", we vary the arbitrary dividing surface and replace it with a dividing surface with ( close to ) locally minimal flux in the chosen direction .",
    "ideally , we would like to find a dividing surface that is crossed once and only once by each trajectory crossing from @xmath55 to @xmath56 , which would have minimal flux through it and would give the actual rate of transport .",
    "hence , we have a variational definition of the ( ideal ) dividing surface",
    ". however , this condition does not necessarily define a unique dividing surface because one can flow any dividing surface along the vector field and obtain another .",
    "furthermore the minimal dividing surfaces might be hard to find in practice .",
    "there is also a flow in the opposite direction , from @xmath56 to @xmath55 , for which we could choose to consider the previous dividing surface , extended to cut all trajectories from @xmath56 to @xmath55 . in order to divide the energy - level and",
    "therefore separate the two regions , we expect the surface to be closed ( i.e. without boundary ) , otherwise trajectories could avoid it but still cross between regions .",
    "thus , the net flux through the dividing surface will be zero , by theorem [ fluxstoke ] , and the flux in the two separate directions equal .",
    "we will now consider which surfaces have locally minimal flux , in either direction , and the properties of such surfaces .",
    "we follow the approach of mackay @xcite , which lends itself well to the general scenarios that we want to consider .",
    "invariant surfaces have zero flux in both directions .",
    "this is clearly a minimum value and when closed these surfaces are useful for transport problems because they separate different regions .",
    "we are interested however in surfaces that have locally minimal but not necessarily zero flux in each direction .    for a general closed , oriented surface @xmath40",
    ", one can decompose it as the union @xmath57 of the parts of positive and negative flux , with common boundary .",
    "then we can apply the following consequence of the variational principle for odd dimensional invariant submanifolds of an energy level .",
    "[ statflux ] a codimension-1 submanifold @xmath58 of an energy level @xmath34 has stationary ( net ) flux of energy - surface volume with respect to variations including of its boundary @xmath59 within @xmath34 if and only if @xmath59 is invariant under the hamiltonian flow .",
    "these stationary values of the flux are however not minima , since there exist deformations that both increase and decrease the flux . a nice way of seeing this is to consider deforming @xmath60 to a helix of small pitch around a part of @xmath60 with @xmath61 . remembering that @xmath18 must be tangent to @xmath60 for stationary values , we find that the flux increases if the pitch has one sign and decreases if it has the other @xcite .",
    "we therefore consider ( unsigned ) _ geometric flux _ of energy - surface volume though @xmath40 , denoted @xmath62 .",
    "for this , we define the ( energy - surface ) _ flux density _ @xmath63 , by @xmath64 and integrate it over @xmath40 . for a brief introduction to densities and density bundles",
    "see e.g. lee ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch.14 ) .    for an arbitrary dividing surface , @xmath65 , with equality",
    "if and only if the flux is unidirectional through the surface . by unidirectional ,",
    "we mean single - signed , as this occurs when the hamiltonian vector field @xmath18 is unidirectional across @xmath40 .",
    "thus , decomposing our closed dividing surface as @xmath66 , where @xmath67 are not necessarily connected , gives @xmath68 since the flux is equal and opposite through @xmath69 and @xmath70 . asking for minimal flux in either direction",
    "is therefore the same as asking for minimal geometric flux . furthermore , closed surfaces either have both stationary net flux and stationary geometric flux or neither .",
    "the idea is therefore to consider dividing surfaces @xmath40 that are the union of two , not necessarily connected , surfaces @xmath67 of unidirectional flux that span a closed , invariant , codimension-2 orientable submanifold @xmath71 in the energy level , @xmath34 .",
    "then @xmath67 have stationary flux , by corollary [ statflux ] , and the geometric flux is @xmath72 where we have chosen the orientation of @xmath71 so that it is @xmath73 . to show that this situation leads to locally minimal geometric flux , we first need the following    an oriented surface @xmath74 has _ local recrossings _ if for all @xmath75 there exists an orbit segment @xmath76 , @xmath77 , that intersects @xmath74 in opposite directions at times @xmath78 and @xmath79 , and for which @xmath80 where @xmath81 denotes distance",

    "these are enlarged to @xmath58 including the invariant parts such that their union is the whole of @xmath40 .",
    "now , assume that @xmath40 has locally minimal geometric flux , then it has stationary flux and its boundary @xmath90 is invariant , by corollary [ statflux ] .",
    "the vector field @xmath18 is tangent to @xmath91 , otherwise we could deform @xmath40 and decrease @xmath92 , see  [ prooffig ] .",
    "therefore @xmath18 is everywhere tangent to @xmath60 , meaning that they are invariant and that @xmath58 have stationary flux , again by corollary [ statflux ] .",
    "if @xmath58 has local recrossings , which must be near @xmath93 , we can decrease @xmath92 by lifting @xmath40 locally , contradicting the assumption , see  [ prooffig ] .",
    "conversely , assume that @xmath40 is the union of surfaces @xmath58 of unidirectional stationary flux .",
    "then the flux through @xmath40 is the sum of those through @xmath58 and thus stationary , giving stationary geometric flux .",
    "the only places where a small deformation would make a difference to @xmath92 are near @xmath93 .",
    "however , if there are no local recrossings , lifting @xmath40 near @xmath93 can not decrease @xmath92 .",
    "this can be shown by contradiction : if @xmath92 can be decreased by a small change , then there are points on @xmath40 whose orbit sneaks back to @xmath40 .",
    "this is the case of an autonomous hamiltonian system @xmath94 with a non - degenerate index-1 critical point @xmath95 of @xmath16 .",
    "it provides an example of a closed , invariant , codimension-2 submanifold of the energy levels spanned by two codimension-1 submanifolds of unidirectional flux with no local recrossings .    about @xmath95",
    ", we have the williamson normal form @xcite @xmath96 where we ask that @xmath23 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 are canonical coordinates with @xmath99 the hyperbolic degree of freedom and @xmath100 the elliptic ones ( * ? ? ?",
    "* app.6 ) . in the chemistry literature",
    "these are called the reaction and bath coordinates , respectively .",
    "note that we do not need the higher - order normal forms found in some of the transition state theory literature , see e.g. wiggins et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we now consider the topology of the energy levels about @xmath95 .",
    "first we consider them to second order , where they are given by @xmath101 with @xmath102 .",
    "therefore , in a neighbourhood of @xmath95 , we can write the energy level as the union of the graphs of two functions @xmath103 over @xmath104 . for @xmath105",
    ", @xmath34 is diffeomorphic to two copies of @xmath104 , whereas for @xmath106 , the two disjoint regions connect and @xmath34 is diffeomorphic to @xmath107 .",
    "this is a standard morse surgery , see theorem [ thmb ] in appendix [ morse ] .",
    "an important feature of the energy levels is the presence of a `` bottleneck '' about @xmath108 , which opens up as the energy is increased from @xmath109 .",
    "the two regions on either side of the critical point are the ones between which we want to study the transport of energy - surface volume . for the topology of the energy - levels of the full system",
    ", we appeal to the morse lemma , see appendix [ morse ] .",
    "this tells us that there are coordinates about the critical point , @xmath108 , for which the hamiltonian function is quadratic .",
    "thus , the previous study of the quadratic case is sufficient .",
    "however , the transformation giving the morse lemma coordinates is not necessarily symplectic .",
    "therefore , whilst these coordinates can be used to study the topology of @xmath34 , they can not be used to study the dynamics without losing the simple expression of the hamiltonian nature of the system .    note",
    "that considering a system with a saddle@xmath110centre@xmath111centre equilibrium , as is often stated , is not actually the same as considering an index-1 critical point of the hamiltonian function for general hamiltonian systems .",
    "we could have for example one unstable dimension and an arbitrary odd index , e.g. three with @xmath112 in the williamson normal form , say . then @xmath34 does not separate for @xmath105 , i.e. the topology is different .",
    "however , for _ _ natural systems _ _ with positive - definite quadratic kinetic energy , these cases can not arise , which is why the two situations are often confused .",
    "we now find an invariant codimension-2 submanifold of the energy levels .",
    "the centre subspace @xmath113 of the linearised dynamics about @xmath95 extends to a centre manifold @xmath9 , which can locally be expressed in the form @xmath114 with the 1-jets of @xmath21 and @xmath115 vanishing at @xmath95 .",
    "then @xmath116 is an invariant submanifold of the energy level .",
    "@xmath71 is diffeomorphic to @xmath117 .",
    "this is proved by using the morse lemma as was done for the energy levels .",
    "the restriction of the hamiltonian function to @xmath9 is @xmath118 thus the origin , @xmath119 , is a critical point of @xmath120 with index-@xmath121 .",
    "then by the morse lemma , in a neighbourhood of @xmath119 , we have @xmath122 , so @xmath123 . finally , by theorem [ thma ] , the diffeomorphism type is valid until the next critical value of @xmath120 ( if one exists ) , and not just for small @xmath124 , a proof of which can be found in sacker @xcite , and was already known to conley and his students , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "we now have to show that @xmath71 can be spanned by surfaces @xmath125 of unidirectional flux . in a neighbourhood of @xmath95",

    "@xmath74 spans @xmath9 , but we must check that it is the union of two surfaces of unidirectional flux .",
    "we decompose it into the parts @xmath127 with @xmath128 and @xmath129 and check that @xmath130 for @xmath128 and vice - versa .",
    "this will ensure that the halves of the dividing surface , @xmath67 , are unidirectional , since the energy levels are invariant .",
    "firstly , we rewrite @xmath131 then we find that @xmath132 now , the invariance of @xmath9 , on which @xmath133 @xmath134 , gives us that @xmath135 where the @xmath8 denotes that the equation is evaluated on @xmath9 .",

    "many transport scenarios , including the basic one for energies significantly above the saddle , can not be considered locally about a critical point .",

    "the dividing surfaces also undergo a similar bifurcation . in this case",

    "the context for these bifurcations is that there is a normally hyperbolic submanifold in the full state space , the transition manifold , denoted @xmath9 .",
    "for example , starting from the basic scenario the transition manifold is an extension of the centre manifold beyond a local neighbourhood of the index-1 critical point .",
    "the transition states are then the level - sets of the hamiltonian function restricted to the transition manifold , @xmath230 , and they undergo a morse bifurcation .",
    "this occurs when @xmath120 has a critical point , and can be studied using morse theory , see appendix [ morse ] .",
    "the critical points of the restricted hamiltonian function @xmath120 are also critical points of the hamiltonian function . for the morse bifurcations",
    ", these will be of index one or higher relative to @xmath120 , and hence of index two or higher relative to @xmath16 .",
    "there have been studies regarding the role of higher index ( than one ) critical points in transport problems , see e.g. ezra and wiggins @xcite , collins , ezra and wiggins @xcite , haller et al .",
    "these have however focused on the higher index critical points and a neighbourhood about these , and thus not searched for the global submanifolds beyond this neighbourhood .",
    "the effect that the morse bifurcations have on the flux of energy - surface volume through the dividing surface is considered in appendix [ fluxch ] .",
    "we now turn to our first example of a morse bifurcation .",
    "this shows one way in which the basic scenario transition state can change topology as the energy increases .",

    "the set of critical points of the hamiltonian function restricted to the fibres , symplectically orthogonal to the axi - symmetric transition manifold , gives an approximate transition manifold as explained in appendix [ nhms ] .",

    "the hamiltonian function for this could be @xmath362 in the uncoupled case with @xmath363 , the transition state bifurcates from @xmath364 to @xmath365 and the dividing surface from @xmath366 to @xmath367 . in the coupled case ,",
    "provided the coupling is sufficiently small , we can treat it as a perturbation of the uncoupled case and invoke the persistence of normally hyperbolic submanifolds to obtain topologically the same picture .      if we restrict our attention to 2 degrees of freedom natural hamiltonian systems , the critical points of the restricted hamiltonian @xmath120 can only have index 0 or 1 . at index-0 critical points a transition state",
    "is `` created '' , whereas at critical energies corresponding to index-1 critical points , seeing as the transition state is closed , the transition state is generically a _ figure eight _",
    "( more complicated cases can occur if there are several critical points with the same energy ) .",
    "thus , the only generic bifurcations scenarios are the connection and disconnection ones found in subsections [ volcano ] and [ ezra ] .",
    "it should be noted however , that this limitation on the types of morse bifurcations of the transition states does not place significant restrictions on the bifurcations of the dividing surfaces . just as we have found genus-1 dividing surfaces ( as well as genus-0 ) , we expect any genus surface should be possible .",
    "we expect that limitations will instead come from the transport problems and that these dividing surfaces will only appear in hamiltonian systems for which the transport problem is not well defined .    for natural systems with 3 degrees of freedom or higher ,",
    "we have seen how the connecting and disconnecting scenarios with index-1 critical points of the restricted hamiltonian function can be coupled to other degrees of freedom .",
    "such systems may also have higher index critical points , which will give rise to other morse bifurcations .",
    "explicit examples of connecting , disconnecting and also higher index morse bifurcations will be seen in the next section in which a hypothetical class of planar bimolecular reactions is considered as an application of the previous sections . here",
    "we find various sequences of morse bifurcations .",
    "as an application of our results , we shall consider ( elementary ) bimolecular reactions in gaseous phase , @xmath368 and show how under a qualitative assumption on the interaction potential these can display interesting transition states and dividing surfaces , as a result of morse bifurcations .",
    "these have not been seen until now , as most studies have focused on the colinear and the zero angular momentum cases . here",
    "we shall consider the planar case , in which the morse bifurcations stand out , and comment on the spatial case , leaving the detailed analysis to a subsequent paper .",
    "some analysis of the structures in reaction dynamics in rotating molecules has been done recently in @xcite , but we are interested in the interaction of two rotating molecules .    physically , we have a gas consisting of large numbers of @xmath369 and @xmath370 ( polyatomic ) molecules contained in some volume . reactions satisfying the usual assumptions of transition state theory can be described , using the born - oppenheimer approximation , as classical dynamics of the nuclei interacting via a potential given by the ( ground state ) energy of the electrons as a function of the internuclear coordinates , see e.g. keck @xcite .",
    "we thus have a very high dimensional hamiltonian system representing a large number of interacting point particles .",
    "then , by assuming that the system is at any instant the product of `` reacting '' two molecule sub - systems that are independent of each other , we may consider an ensemble of these low dimensional hamiltonian systems representing the reaction .",
    "that is we require the gas to be sufficiently dilute .",
    "the transport problem we consider is that of finding the rate of transport between the region of state space representing two distant molecules ( reactants ) and the region in which the molecules are close .",
    "the latter do not however generally constitute the products .",
    "although the molecules must collide to react , whether the bonds are then broken and they go on to produce new molecules , with new bonds , is generally governed by further barriers .",
    "the rate obtained from this transport problem is therefore often referred to as the `` collision '' or `` capture '' rate .",

    "the transport problem is clearly seen in the trivial example of a bimolecular reaction between two atoms ( or charged particles ) . reducing the atom plus atom reacting system",
    ", we obtain a central force field hamiltonian system @xmath371 with canonical sympletic form and @xmath372 where @xmath1 is the reduced mass , @xmath373 is the magnitude of the angular momentum , and @xmath374 is the _ effective potential _ with the _ centrifugal term_.",

    "however , its hyperbolicity will depend on this interplay , so to keep the examples simple , especially in higher degrees of freedom , we assume that @xmath167 has a non - degenerate maximum .",

    "singular reduction theory , though quite involved , provides a global geometric picture . alternatively , seeing as the system is natural and has a lifted action , we can perform the reduction in configuration space instead by looking at the gauge theoretic cotangent bundle reduction picture , which is straightforward and gives an explicit choice of charts .",
    "this is nicely reviewed by littlejohn and reinsch @xcite .",

    "e.g.  such that the line of centres is along the @xmath154-axis , @xmath394 .",

    "this gives a specific choice of coordinates .",
    "finally , seeing as the magnitude of the angular momentum is conserved , the angular momentum lives on a 2-sphere @xmath397 and its dynamics is coupled to the internal motions , cf . the rigid body case .",
    "one can complete the reduction by introducing canonical ( serret - andoyer ) coordinates on @xmath397 , but these introduce coordinate singularities and two charts are needed @xcite .",
    "the state space of the reduced system is then a stratified fibre bundle , and the dynamics can be considered separately on each stratum @xcite .",

    "we choose to work with the following    consider a dynamical system @xmath507 consisting of a @xmath165 flow @xmath508 on a smooth manifold @xmath13 , and choose a riemannian metric on @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath9 be a compact ( possibly with boundary ) @xmath165 submanifold of @xmath13 that is invariant under the flow , i.e. @xmath509 .",
    "we say that @xmath9 is a _ normally hyperbolic submanifold _ ( of the dynamical system ) if the tangent bundle of @xmath13 restricted to @xmath9 , @xmath510 , can be split continuously @xmath511 such that @xmath512 are invariant under @xmath513 for all @xmath514 and there exist real numbers @xmath515 and @xmath516 , such that for all @xmath183 , we have the following growth rates @xmath517 where @xmath518 are the projections induced by the splitting .",
    "this is stronger than the usual definition , say that of fenichel @xcite as we can see from his uniformity lemma , but appropriate for our purposes .",
    "note that generally the normal hyperbolicity will depend on the choice of splitting .",
    "there exists an invariant splitting that simplifies the theory , and is forced upon the definition in most of the literature .",
    "however , this choice of splitting is unnecessary and when considering concrete examples finding it can be cumbersome . like fenichel @xcite , which uses a riemannian splitting",
    ", we choose a general splitting that is not invariant .",
    "for the general properties of normally hyperbolic submanifolds , such as persistence , stable and unstable manifolds and smoothness results , see e.g. fenichel @xcite or hirsch , pugh and shub @xcite",
    ".    given a vector field @xmath21 generating the flow @xmath508 , the linearised flow @xmath513 about the normally hyperbolic submanifold @xmath9 satisfies the ( first ) variation equation @xmath519 for @xmath183 , @xmath520 .",
    "the splitting allows us to write @xmath521 .",

    "a main theorem on normally hyperbolic submanifolds tells us that given an `` almost invariant '' normally hyperbolic submanifold @xmath252 of a dynamical system , meaning that on @xmath252 the normal component of the vector field is small , there exists a true normally hyperbolic submanifold @xmath9 nearby .",
    "here , we are only interested in symplectic , normally hyperbolic submanifolds of hamiltonian systems and we want to find sufficiently good approximations to the hamiltonian on such a normally hyperbolic submanifold to deduce the sequence of morse bifurcations as energy is increased .",
    "thus , we will show how to find a better approximation of an almost invariant normally hyperbolic symplectic submanifold @xmath252 , using a symplectically orthogonal fibration of its neighbourhood .",

    "then , to check that @xmath556 is small compared to @xmath553 , we first find that @xmath557 for @xmath555 , @xmath558 with @xmath559 , @xmath560 and @xmath257 slightly larger than 1",
    ". this can be seen by splitting the vectors tangent to @xmath281 into a horizontal and vertical part , namely @xmath561 , and writing @xmath562 as @xmath563 .",
    "the tangent vectors satisfy @xmath564 so @xmath565 then @xmath566 and @xmath557 .",

    "note however that beyond the first iteration , the required procedure is more subtle than @xcite might lead one to suppose . in order to ensure that",
    "for the successive approximations the normal vector field is of the order of higher powers of the tangential vector field , one has to carefully choose a nearly symplectically orthogonal fibration at each subsequent step .",
    "mackay gave a talk at the newton institute in cambridge in 2007 where this was addressed and an incomplete draft paper of 3 march 2007 sketches the procedure , but the paper has not yet been completed .",
    "morse theory allows us to study the topology of a manifold by considering the properties of `` height '' functions on it , and vice versa .",
    "it is therefore a natural tool for hamiltonian systems with their hamiltonian functions .",
    "we briefly state a few of the definitions and theorems ( without proofs ) and mention how they can be used to study bifurcations . for details",
    "see e.g. milnor @xcite or bott @xcite .",
    "consider an @xmath1-dimensional smooth manifold @xmath13 and a smooth function @xmath573 .",

    "the _ nullity _ of @xmath501 relative to @xmath16 is the dimension of the null - space , i.e. the subspace consisting of all @xmath586 such that @xmath587 for all @xmath588 .    in local coordinates ,",
    "the index is the number of negative eigenvalues of the local representation of the hessian at @xmath501 , @xmath589 , counting multiplicities .",

    "recall that a critical point is called _ nondegenerate _ if the hessian has nullity zero .",
    "let @xmath501 be a nondegenerate critical point , relative to @xmath16 , of index @xmath49 .",
    "then , in some open neighbourhood of @xmath501 , there are local coordinates @xmath592 taking the critical point to the origin , and for which the local representation of @xmath16 satisfies @xmath593    now , for a real number @xmath594 , @xmath595 is the _ sub - level set _ , for @xmath594 .",
