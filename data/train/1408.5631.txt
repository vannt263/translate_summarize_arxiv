    "has been regarded as a prototypical model system for magnanites , being one of the highest @xmath8 manganites that can be grown .",
    "however , it seems as use of the manganites in devices is obstructed by change in properties when interfaced to other materials @xcite .",
    "accordingly , understanding the surface and interface properties through the study of the thickness dependence magnetic and transport properties have been the focus of several studies .",
    "such studies report on reduced @xmath8 and enlarged coercivity with decreasing thickness , while indicating the existence of inactive and electrically insulating interface layers of thin films @xcite grown on srtio@xmath2(001 ) , these studies report that very thin layers 3 - 4 unit cells films ( uc ) are nonmagnetic , and that they become conductive and magnetic at a thickness of 6 - 8 uc .",
    "in contrast to the well studied thickness evolution of static magnetic and transport properties , less attention has been paid to magneto dynamic properties , which may provide further information on important length scales for establishment of lsmo bulk properties in thin films .",
    "dynamic properties as investigated through ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy ( fmr ) can be used to extract information about the local magnetic environment ; fmr line positions and line shapes can thus provide information on both magnetic state , local anisotropies , and defects @xcite .",

    "however , no concerted effort has been made to map thickness and temperature dependence of the dynamic properties and to understand the physical processes that determine the fmr line - width in lsmo thin films .    in this study",
    "we map out the thickness dependence of dynamic magnetic properties for thin film lsmo on srtio@xmath2(001 ) ( sto ) . by linking static and dynamic properties in the thin film region",
    "we can explore magnetic anisotropies , damping , coercivity and ordering temperature as a function of film thickness .",
    "this gives an opportunity to evaluate the effect of reduced dimensionality and presence of interfaces , on the dynamic magnetic properties of lsmo .",
    "a series of lsmo thin films ranging from 3 to 150 uc in thickness were grown epitaxially by pulsed laser deposition ( pld ) using a stoichiometric target and a krf laser ( @xmath10 nm ) at 1 hz with a fluency of @xmath7 2 j/@xmath11 .",

    "reciprocal space maps around the ( 103 ) reflection showed a coherently in - plane strained lattice in that direction commensurate with the sto lattice @xmath15  . the films are grown in growth mode that yields all four possible rhombohedral variants @xcite .",

    "are surface / interface imperfections / scatterers which can induce a direct thickness dependent broadening due to local variations in resonance field , or indirectly through two - magnon processes , both which become more dominating as the thickness is reduced .",
    "such variations can be caused both by inhomogeneities in stoichiometry at the surfaces of the film @xcite , by the uc stepped surface of the sto substrates , as well as more complex interface effects @xcite .",

    "we attribute this contribution to the variation on the local scale of the anisotropy , introducing a broadening that is proportional to the derivative of the resonance field out of plane angle @xcite .",
    "this term increases at high angles , and as it is thickness dependent we associate it with anisotropy changes due to local surface induced anisotropy variations , which become less important for thick films .    for both rotational axes ( @xmath76 ) the delta - widths ( @xmath47 and @xmath77 ) , increase with decreased temperatures but display little thickness dependence , as shown in fig .",

    "we observe that the static measurements yields @xmath73.7@xmath52/mn and a @xmath8 that is well described through a mean field model for all thicknesses , and that all films include magnetically inactive layers corresponding to @xmath7 4 uc thickness .",
    "the contrast between dynamic and static magnetic measurements provides new information on the thickness behavior : the very thin film , @xmath3 = 6 uc , displays significantly altered dynamic properties compared to thicker films yet the volume magnetization indicates that the film still contains a stoichiometric magnetic volume , and it is well modelled by the mean field model describing the reduced @xmath8 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mag_comb]c , d ) .",
    "this discrepancy between the static and the dynamic behavior can be attributed to possible polaron confinement resulting from the reduced dimensionality and/or magnetic anisotropy disorder at the magnetic interfaces . at 6 uc thickness",
    ", the magnetic layer should be @xmath7 2 uc thick , comparable to the polaron size of @xmath7 3 mn ions @xcite .",
    "such localization could also be induced by the increased relative contributions of interfaces at this thickness , further driving the trapping .",
    "we also note that the abrupt change in dynamic properties from 6 to 8 uc correlates well with the reported ferromagnetic - insulator / ferromagnetic - metal transition occurring at this thickness @xcite , consistent with polaron confinement , which influences charge transport in lsmo @xcite . given the distinct thickness behaviour of the dynamic properties revealed in this study it would be interesting to directly link it to the charge transport behaviour of the particular thin films .",

    "we have here reported a combined thickness and temperature dependent study of static and dynamic properties of lsmo thin films . a reduced curie temperature of the thinner films is well described by a mean field model with a constant volume magnetization for all films which accounts for the thickness dependence of @xmath8 , @xmath38 and magnetic anisotropy constants @xmath81 and @xmath29 that we have extracted from our measurements .",
    "we distinguish between three different thickness regions . at 6",
    "uc we have little dynamic coherence , but static ferromagnetic order . in the transition region 8 uc @xmath5 uc we identify a gradual decrease in line - width with a single resonance peak that indicates an increasingly coherent magnetic phase with a decreasing magnitude of 2-magnon related scattering processes close to @xmath8 . at 20",
    "uc @xmath4 the surface contribution to 2-magnon processes is no longer dominating and we observe a observe a bulk like behavior .    comparing with previous reports on the thickness dependence of static magnetic properties @xcite , we observe a complementary picture : down to 8 uc , the magnetization and the anisotropies of the films remaining bulk - like indicate a close to stoichiometric composition of the contributing volumes of the sample .",
    "the damping seems to be dominated by extrinsic effects : for thin films , locally varying surface induced anisotropy dominates as indicated both by the strong 2-magnon scattering at high temperatures and a high contribution from mosaicity induced broadening at close to normal angles at low temperatures . for thicker samples , a large contribution to the in - plane variation of the broadening",
