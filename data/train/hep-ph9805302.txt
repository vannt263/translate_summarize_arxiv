    "among the various scenarios which attempt to explain the baryon asymmetry of our universe , the mechanism of electroweak baryogenesis continues being one of the most attractive @xcite .",
    "one of the motivations to consider the electroweak scenario lies of course in the fact that with the advent of new high - energy colliders , physics at the electroweak scale becomes more accessible and testable .",
    "furthermore , it is very appealing the fact that all the necessary ingredients for a successful baryogenesis @xcite ( i.e. baryon number violation , @xmath4 and @xmath0 violation and departure from thermal equilibrium ) can be easily found in quantum theories of particle interactions .",
    "unfortunately , the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interactions fails in providing the required baryon asymmetry for at least two reasons .",
    "firstly , the electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) is not strongly first - order @xcite and therefore , any @xmath5 created during the transition would subsequently be washed out by unsuppressed @xmath6-violating processes in the broken phase .",
    "secondly , the @xmath0-violating effects coming from the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mixing matrix are too small @xcite to explain the observed baryon - to - entropy ratio @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "thus , for electroweak baryogenesis to be feasible , physics beyond the minimal standard model must be invoked .",
    "several extensions of the sm have been studied in the literature . in particular , in the two higgs doublet model @xcite , the singlet majoron model @xcite and in the sm with an extra real higgs singlet @xcite or a complex gauge singlet with zero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xcite , the first - order ewpt can be strong enough to suppress the sphaleron interactions after the transition .",
    "however , it should be stressed that a strong first - order phase transition is not sufficient for a successful baryogenesis ; an adequate amount of @xmath0 violation is also required .",
    "supersymmetric extensions of the sm also provide a possible framework for electroweak baryogenesis .",
    "for instance , in the so - called light stop scenario of the minimal supersymmetric standard model the phase transition can be sufficiently strongly first - order @xcite-@xcite for values of the lightest higgs  and stop masses consistent with the present experimental bounds .",
    "furthermore , the latter model contains additional sources of @xmath0 violation which can account for the observed baryon asymmetry @xcite-@xcite .    in this letter",
    "we analyze the mechanism of electroweak baryogenesis in a simple extension of the sm , where the only additional fields are a charge -1/3 vector - like quark @xmath8 and a singlet complex scalar @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the addition of extra vector - like quarks to the sm is particularly attractive since they naturally arise in grand unified theories such as @xmath10 .",
    "after briefly describing the model and explaining how the higgs sector spontaneously breaks @xmath0 through a phase in the vev of the singlet scalar , we proceed to study the electroweak phase transition .",
    "we show that in a wide range of the parameter space and provided that one of the singlet scalar components  is light enough , the first - order ewpt can be sufficiently strong so that the sphaleron interactions in the broken phase are too slow to erase the baryon asymmetry created during the transition .",
    "we also discuss the possible mechanisms of baryon number violation in the present model . as far as spontaneous baryogenesis @xcite ( through a space - time dependent complex vev of the singlet field and/or a radiatively induced @xmath11 )",
    "is concerned , it turns out that it can not give the right order of magnitude for the observed @xmath12 ratio .",
    "nevertheless , a strong enhancement compared to the sm can be obtained via reflection of quasiparticles on the bubble wall ( charge transport baryogenesis @xcite ) since the model has new lower dimensional @xmath0-violating weak - basis invariants ( compared to the sm @xmath0-violating invariant ) .",
    "we consider a simple extension of the sm where , in addition to the usual field content , we introduce in the fermion sector a vector - like down quark @xmath8 , singlet under @xmath13 and in the higgs sector , an extra complex scalar @xmath9 , singlet under @xmath14 @xcite .  as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , this minimal higgs structure can spontaneously break @xmath0 through a phase in the vev of the singlet @xmath15 furthermore , this phase induces a non - vanishing phase in the ckm matrix , which is not suppressed by a small ratio @xmath16 we emphasize that small values of the latter ratio are desirable to naturally suppress not only the existing flavour - changing neutral currents , but also the one - loop finite contributions to the parameter @xmath2 associated with strong @xmath0 violation @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the most stringent bounds on the vev of the scalar singlet , @xmath17 come from the new contributions to the neutron electric dipole moment .",
    "nevertheless , the present experimental limit @xmath18 cm @xcite  implies @xmath19 few tev  for acceptable values of the couplings and parameters of the model @xcite .",
    "the field content of the model is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 are family indices and @xmath22  denote the standard higgs doublet and the extra complex scalar singlet , respectively .",
    "we impose @xmath0 invariance at the lagrangian level and also introduce a @xmath23 discrete symmetry under which @xmath24 and @xmath9  are odd , while all the other fields are even .",
    "the role of the @xmath23 symmetry is to forbid quark bare mass terms of the form @xmath25 and therefore , to guarantee the vanishing of @xmath26-strong at the tree level .",
    "however , we will allow a soft breaking of such symmetry in the scalar sector . as we shall see below , soft - breaking terms , linear and cubic in the singlet scalar field , will play a crucial role in avoiding the baryon asymmetry washout by sphalerons during the ewpt .",
    "the most general @xmath27 invariant potential can be written in the form @xmath28 all the parameters are assumed to be real , so that the lagrangian is @xmath0 invariant .",
    "in addition to @xmath29 , we shall introduce the following @xmath30-breaking terms in the direction of the real component of the singlet scalar field @xmath31 with @xmath32 and @xmath33 real .",
    "the @xmath27 invariant yukawa interactions are @xmath34 where @xmath35 and all interaction constants are real because of @xmath0 invariance .",
    "the down quark mass matrix @xmath36 can be then written as follows : @xmath37{ll}% m_{d } & 0\\\\ m_{d } & \\mu_{d}% \\end{array } \\right ) \\label{mdown}%\\ ] ] with @xmath38 @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the vev for the neutral higgs doublet and the singlet scalar , respectively .",
    "the up quark mass matrix is the same as in the sm , @xmath41    for our purposes it will be more convenient to express the complex scalar @xmath9 in terms of its real and imaginary parts .",
    "let us write @xmath42 and denote by @xmath43 the neutral component of the higgs field . in terms of these fields",
    ", the potential @xmath44 reads @xmath45 with the obvious identifications : @xmath46 in what follows we suppose @xmath47    after the spontaneous symmetry breaking we have @xmath48 if the absolute minimum of the potential ( [ vt0 ] ) is at @xmath49 and @xmath50 then the vacuum breaks in general both @xmath51 and @xmath0 invariance .",
    "such spontaneous @xmath0 breaking is expected to occur at a high energy scale ( @xmath19 few tev ) and at least one of the vev , @xmath52 or @xmath53 , should be of the order of this scale . on the other hand , in order to avoid the baryon asymmetry washout by the sphalerons during the ewpt , one of the singlet components must be light enough to produce a strong first - order phase transition .",
    "we shall assume that the field component @xmath54 is heavy , @xmath55 few tev , while @xmath56 is light , @xmath57 .",
    "in this case , the @xmath54 field will decouple from the theory and the tree - level potential is reduced to the sm one , plus a real singlet field .",
    "we stress however that , although not relevant in our analysis of the phase transition , the @xmath54 field will play an essential role ( through the phase @xmath58 in what concerns the magnitude of @xmath0 violation and production of a net baryon asymmetry , @xmath59 during the ewpt .",
    "notice also that to have @xmath60 without any further fine tuning , the parameters @xmath61 and @xmath62 in eq.([vt0 ] ) should be taken small enough . here",
    "we will assume , for simplicity , @xmath63    under the above assumptions , the minimization of ( [ vt0 ] ) implies @xmath64 while for @xmath65 one obtains the system of equations : @xmath66 the system ( [ minv])-([mins1 ] ) can have up to six solutions ( with @xmath67 ) , two of which can be local minima .",
    "the field - dependent scalar masses are given by @xmath68 \\nonumber\\\\ &   \\mp\\frac{1}{2}\\left\\ {   \\left [   -m^{2}+\\mu_{1}^{2}+\\left (   3\\lambda -\\beta_{1}\\right )   v^{2}+\\left (   \\beta_{1}-3\\lambda_{1}\\right )   s_{1}% ^{2}+2\\left (   \\xi+\\alpha\\right )   s_{1}\\right ]   ^{2}\\right .",

    "the gauge boson masses remain the same as in the sm . at the global minimum , which satisfies eqs.([minv])-([mins1 ] )",
    ", we have the following relations for the physical masses : @xmath70 with @xmath71 gev in order to reproduce the experimental values of the gauge boson masses , @xmath72 gev , @xmath73 gev .",
    "let us now study how the electroweak phase transition proceeds in the present model . in the presence of a thermal bath , the effective potential ( i.e. the free energy density ) must include the interactions between the fields and the hot plasma . at one loop in perturbation theory ,",
    "this amounts to add to the ground state energy , the free energy of a gas of noninteracting particles at finite temperature .",
    "the result is well known @xcite @xmath74 where @xmath75 are the boson ( fermion ) degrees of freedom ; @xmath76  is the mass of a boson ( fermion ) in the presence of background fields . in the high temperature limit ,",
    "when @xmath77 , eq.([dvt ] ) can be expanded in powers of @xmath78 and one obtains @xcite @xmath79   \\right\\ } , \\label{highdvt}%\\ ] ] where @xmath80 for bosons ( fermions ) and @xmath81 @xmath82 .    at this point",
    "it is worthwhile making a few comments .",
    "first we notice that in the high temperature limit the @xmath51-independent vacuum fluctuations @xmath83 in eq.([highdvt ] ) are exactly cancelled by similar contributions coming from the one - loop effective potential at @xmath84 as far as the @xmath85 fluctuations are concerned , they tend to modify the quartic terms , but are subdominant provided the couplings are small . in what follows we shall assume that the latter conditions apply and therefore we neglect these terms .",
    "similarly , we shall also neglect all one - loop scalar self - interactions .",
    "finally , we note that since for the scalar component @xmath86 , its contribution to the finite temperature effective potential is boltzmann suppressed .",
    "the same argument applies to the vector - like down quark @xmath8 which is assumed to have a mass @xmath87    thus , adding the zero - temperature potential ( [ vt0 ] ) and the finite - temperature terms ( [ dvt ] ) for all the relevant particles involved ( higgs , goldstone and gauge bosons , singlet scalar and top quark ) , finally we obtain the approximate one - loop effective potential at high temperatures @xmath88 where @xmath89 and we have used the experimental central value for the top quark mass @xmath90 gev @xcite .",
    "the minimization of the free energy density ( [ vt ] ) with respect to the fields @xmath91 and @xmath56 yields the system of equations @xmath92 solving this system we can find @xmath93 and @xmath94 note that as @xmath95 the solution of  ( [ minvt])-([mins1 t ] ) is @xmath96 therefore , the electroweak symmetry restoration does take place at high temperature , while in general @xmath97 . as the universe cools down , a new minimum will appear with @xmath98 and the electroweak symmetry will be spontaneously broken .",
    "the interesting issue is , of course , the nature of such a transition . in order to make electroweak baryogenesis possible ,",
    "a strong enough first - order ewpt is required , so that any baryon asymmetry produced during the transition can survive without being diluted by the sphalerons . in the sm",
    "( with only one higgs doublet ) , the requirement for the survival of the baryon asymmetry produced at the electroweak scale is given by @xcite @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the sphaleron energy , @xmath101 is the critical temperature and @xmath102 for @xmath103 thus , a large jump in the higgs vev is required during the transition , @xmath104 which in turn translates into an upper bound on the higgs mass .",
    "there are convincing arguments @xcite that the first - order phase transition in the minimal sm is too weak to yield an acceptable baryon asymmetry for higgs masses consistent with the present experimental bounds @xcite . in the model we are considering",
    ", one expects however new effects to come from the linear and cubic terms in the singlet field @xmath105 which can lead to an enhancement of the first - order ewpt . to show that this is indeed the case , we looked for the coexistence of two degenerate minima in the potential of eq.([vt ] ) at some ( critical ) temperature by solving the extrema eqs.([minvt])-([mins1 t ] ) .",
    "then we verified that the constraint given by eq.([vovert ] ) was satisfied ) also applies to models with additional singlet scalar fields since the sphaleron energy in such models is smaller than the corresponding one of the standard model @xcite . ] .",
    "the parameter space was chosen in the region of validity of eq.([vt ] ) and of compatibility with the present experimental limits on the higgs mass . in the @xmath106-plane",
    "we found a wide parameter range where there exist two degenerate minima , namely @xmath107 and @xmath108 and for which the constraint of eq.([vovert ] ) is satisfied .",
    "the first - order phase transition occurs as the global minimum tunnels from @xmath107 ( symmetric phase ) to @xmath109 ( broken phase ) .",
    "for @xmath110 we also find in general another first - order phase transition in the @xmath52-direction @xcite , but this transition is not necessary for electroweak baryogenesis to succeed .",
    "in fig.1 we plot the ratio @xmath111 as a function of the @xmath30-breaking parameter @xmath32 for the particular values of @xmath112 and for the higgs mass values @xmath113 gev .",
    "fig.2 shows the allowed region in the plane @xmath114 where the constraint ( [ vovert ] ) is satisfied for @xmath115 and @xmath116 gev .",
    "we see that there exists a wide range in the parameter space where the ewpt is strongly first - order and thus baryogenesis is possible .",
    "we also notice that the soft - breaking terms ( cf .",
    "eq.([vsoft ] ) ) play a crucial role in this respect .",
    "a strong enough first - order ewpt is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for baryogenesis to succeed . to explain the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe a right amount of @xmath0 violation",
    "is also required .",
    "two of the appealing features of the model under consideration are the possibility of spontaneous @xmath0 violation and natural suppression of strong @xmath0 violation @xcite .",
    "the model satisfies the nelson - barr criteria @xcite which guarantee the tree - level vanishing of the @xmath117 parameter .",
    "moreover , due to the presence of vector - like quarks ,  there are new sources of @xmath0 violation . in general in an extension of the sm with @xmath118 standard generations and @xmath119  isosinglet quarks , the generalized ckm  matrix consists of the first @xmath118 lines of a @xmath120-dimensional unitary matrix and it has been shown @xcite that there are @xmath121 physical @xmath0-violating phases in the ckm  matrix .",
    "hence , with @xmath122 and @xmath123 , there are three @xmath0-violating phases .",
    "more importantly , it has been shown @xcite that in this minimal extension of the sm , there is @xmath0 violation even in the chiral limit where @xmath124 this implies that @xmath0-violating effects relevant for baryogenesis at the ewpt will not be suppressed by the smallness of the light quark masses . at this point , it is worth recalling that in the three generation sm , the strength of @xmath0 violation is controlled by the invariant @xcite @xmath125 = \\frac{1}{3}\\text{tr}\\left [ ( m_{u}m_{u}^{\\dagger } ) , ( m_{d}m_{d}^{\\dagger } ) \\right ]   ^{3}\\nonumber\\\\ &   = -2i\\left (   \\delta_{tc}^{2}\\delta_{tu}^{2}\\delta_{cu}^{2}\\right )   \\left ( \\delta_{bs}^{2}\\delta_{bd}^{2}\\delta_{sd}^{2}\\right )   \\text{im}\\left ( v_{ud}v_{cs}v_{us}^{\\ast}v_{cd}^{\\ast}\\right )   , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath126 are the up and down quark mass matrices and @xmath127 .",
    "a natural question is whether in the present model there are new @xmath0 violating weak - basis invariants which may play a role in the generation of the observed baryon asymmetry violation in models with vector - like quarks and their role in electroweak baryogenesis , see e.g.  refs.@xcite . ] . in ref.@xcite",
    "a complete set of necessary and sufficient conditions for @xmath0 invariance were given , expressed in terms of weak - basis invariants .",
    "in particular , it was shown that in the presence of one vector - like down quark the lowest weak - basis invariant is : @xmath128,\\label{lowinv}%\\ ] ] where @xmath126 and @xmath129 matrices are defined as in eqs.([mdown])-([mup ] ) .",
    "it can also be shown that in the chiral limit @xmath130 all weak - basis invariants which measure @xmath0 violation in the present model , are proportional to @xmath131 therefore , @xmath132 plays the same role that @xmath133 plays in the sm , giving the strength of @xmath0 violation relevant for baryogenesis at the ewpt .    in the sm , based on dimensional analysis , a naive estimate for the baryon asymmetry",
    "can be given as @xcite @xmath134 where @xmath101 is the critical temperature ( natural mass scale ) at the ewpt .",
    "in fact ,  a more refined analysis shows that the critical temperature is not the only scale at the phase transition .",
    "taking into account the effects of strong interactions on the lifetime of quasiparticles , a better estimate of the baryon asymmetry in the sm can be given @xcite : @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the coherence length of the quasiparticles ( i.e. the distance over which the quasiparticles propagate during their lifetime ) .",
    "thus , there are two relevant scales , namely , the critical temperature @xmath101 and the inverse of the coherence length @xmath137 .    in our model",
    "two different mechanisms of baryogenesis can occur :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ - _ spontaneous baryogenesis _ through a space - time dependent complex vev of the singlet @xmath9 and/or through a radiatively induced @xmath138 ,    - _ charge transport baryogenesis _ through reflection of quasiparticles off the oncoming bubble wall during the phase transition .",

    "nevertheless , a strong enhancement compared to the sm results can be obtained via reflection of quasiparticles on the bubble wall .",
    "let us first discuss the spontaneous baryogenesis in the framework of our model . from the form of the down quark matrix given in eq.([mdown ] )",
    "it follows that @xmath139 during the electroweak phase transition , @xmath36 is a space - time dependent function of the vev of the scalar higgs doublet and the singlet field .",
    "the matrix @xmath36 can be diagonalized by unitary matrices belonging to the @xmath140 group .",
    "the kinetic term for fermions is not invariant under the field redefinition which diagonalizes @xmath36 .",
    "however , all the currents induced by this redefinition are orthogonal to the baryonic charge .",
    "thus , imposing @xmath117 to be zero at the tree level implies in a natural way that the spontaneous baryogenesis mechanism is inefficient to produce the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "similar conclusions can be drawn for the radiatively induced @xmath141 .",
    "indeed , the detailed balance principle allows us to relate the baryon density @xmath142 to the chemical potential @xmath143 @xmath144 associated to the baryonic charge ( @xmath145 is a constant ) , @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the number of flavours , @xmath148 is the sphaleron rate and the integration goes until the time when the anomalous processes are out of thermal  equilibrium .",
    "given that the entropy density is @xmath149 and that on dimensional grounds @xmath150 in the symmetric phase , one finds for the baryon - to - entropy ratio @xmath151 with @xmath152 is the effective number of degrees of freedom at the electroweak scale , @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "we remark that the most severe constraint on @xmath117 comes from the experimental limits on the neutron electric dipole moment , @xmath18 cm @xcite , which implies @xmath155    to evaluate the effects of @xmath0-violation  due to reflection of quasiparticles on the bubble wall we shall follow the approach of ref.@xcite .",
    "the first - order ewpt proceeds via nucleation of bubbles , inside which the vev of the higgs field @xmath98 and which expand until they fill up the symmetric ( @xmath156 ) universe . due to @xmath0-violating effects , quarks and antiquarks reflect asymmetrically on the bubble wall and therefore their distributions are different inside and outside the bubble .",
    "the fast @xmath6-violating processes will cause @xmath157 to relax to zero in the symmetric phase .",
    "the net baryon number produced is equal to ( minus ) the thermal average of the baryon number in the unbroken phase ( i.e. the sum of the excess of baryons from the symmetric phase reflected off the wall plus the excess of baryons transmitted from the broken phase into the symmetric one ) .    using unitarity and @xmath158 invariance , and assuming that the sphaleron rate is equal to infinity in the unbroken phase and equal to zero in the broken phase , the ratio @xmath12  can be given as @xcite @xmath159,\\label{nbsym}%\\ ] ] where the matrix ( in flavour space ) @xmath160 is the probability of a left - handed quark to be reflected on the bubble wall into a right - handed quark ; @xmath161 are fermi - dirac distributions boosted to the bubble wall frame , @xmath162=1/(e^{\\gamma ( \\omega+\\vec{v}_{\\text{w}}.\\vec{p})/t}+1),\\gamma$ ] is the relativistic factor , @xmath163 is the bubble wall velocity and @xmath164 is the quasiparticle four - momentum . for small wall velocities ,",

    "the above equation can be expressed in terms of the mixing angles and the physical quark masses .",
    "then , using the constraints coming from fcnc and the measured elements of the ckm matrix , an estimate on the @xmath8 quark mass can be given in order to reproduce the observed baryon asymmetry .",
    "in the chiral limit @xmath130 all @xmath0-violating effects are due to physics beyond the sm . in this limit",
    ", the lowest invariant ( [ lowinv ] ) can be easily written in terms of mixing angles and quark masses @xcite .",
    "we have @xmath169  where @xmath170 are matrix elements of the @xmath171 unitary matrix @xmath172 which diagonalizes @xmath173 , in the weak - basis where @xmath174 is diagonal .",
    "therefore , @xmath175    the observed value for the cosmological baryon asymmetry is @xmath176 the main constraint on the mixing angles comes from the fcnc and is given by @xmath177 @xcite . using the values @xmath178 gev , @xmath179 , @xmath180 gev , @xmath181 gev , and assuming that the mixing angles are of the order of the above bound",
    ", we derive that the required mass of the @xmath8 quark should be about @xmath182 gev .",
    "of course , this value of @xmath183 should be taken only as a rough estimate , in view of uncertainties in the evaluation of the baryon - to - entropy ratio ( in particular concerning the properties of the matter during the phase transition and the propagation of the bubble wall ) . in spite of these uncertainties ,",
    "one may safely conclude that in the present model a @xmath8 quark mass of the order of a few hundred gev is needed in order to produce the baryon asymmetry of the universe at the electroweak scale .",
    "a final comment is in order .",
    "it is clear that the sign of the quantity @xmath184 is dictated by the sign of the baryon asymmetry @xmath185 now , due to unitarity constraints , @xmath186 is related to the imaginary parts of other rephasing invariant quartets @xcite .",
    "indeed one obtains : @xmath187 where @xmath188    note that @xmath189 @xmath190 in eq.([q2to5 ] ) involve ckm matrix elements connecting only standard quarks . in the sm , as a result of @xmath191 unitarity of @xmath192 , all @xmath189 @xmath190 are equal and therefore the r.h.s . of eq.([imq1 ] ) vanishes .",
    "it is clear that @xmath186 can in principle be obtained from low energy data signaling deviations from the sm predictions .",
    "in this letter we have considered the possibility of generating at the electroweak scale the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe in a simple extension of the sm , in which a complex singlet scalar field and an isosinglet down quark are added to the theory .",
    "we have shown that in the presence of soft @xmath23-breaking terms , linear and cubic in the singlet field , the first - order electroweak phase transition can be strong enough to suppress the @xmath6-violating sphaleron processes after the transition , thus avoiding the washout of any @xmath6 asymmetry generated during the transition . moreover",
    ", we have seen that in the presence of isosinglet quarks , the theory contains new lower dimensional @xmath0-violating weak - basis invariants , which can significantly contribute to the produced baryon asymmetry at the electroweak scale via the charge transport mechanism .    of course",
    ", there are still uncertainties in the evaluation of the baryon - to - entropy ratio .",
    "nevertheless , relations ( [ nbtos])-([q2to5 ] ) show that the sign of @xmath0-violation in the @xmath193- and @xmath6-meson systems could in principle be related to the sign of the baryon asymmetry of the universe . in our opinion",
