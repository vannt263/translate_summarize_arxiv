    "methods and techniques inspired by statistical physics have been shown to be useful in the search for hidden features in social systems @xcite . particularly , it has been remarked that social systems can exhibit universal properties similarly to thermodynamical systems at the criticality .",

    "we apply a statistical approach to investigate patterns and growth characteristics of homicide .    in a quantitative manner , our study provides insights on how the growth of crime and the size of cities are related .",

    "the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 are asymptotic exponents of the main tendencies of the standard deviations @xmath21 of the logarithmic growth rates ( see equation ( [ eq:7 ] ) ) .",
    "a large part of the literature about criminality tries to relate crime rates to possible explicative variables as average income , unemployment , inequality , gender , age , education level , race and others related to delinquency , even though statistical data of crime rates can not give much information on this @xcite .",
    "certainly , cities with the same size can present different numbers of crimes ( as exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig : crimepop ] ) usually due to socio - economic aspects . however , in our analysis we have not specified such dependences since our results arise from a more general statistical context .",
    "this fact can be viewed as reminiscent of the concept of universality found in statistical physics , where different systems can be characterized by the same fundamental laws , independent of the microscopic details @xcite .",
    "systems with the same values of critical - point exponents and scaling functions are said to belong to the same universality class @xcite . to find an exponent for the relationship between standard deviation and city size is , somehow , to indicate the class to which the system belongs .",
    "in fact , in other contexts @xcite the analog of this exponent generally assumes different values .",
    "the presence of non - systematic errors on two commonly employed databases , fbi ( federal bureau of investigation ) and ucr ( uniform crime report u.s.a . ) ones , has been pointed out due to a lack of reports from some local agencies @xcite . for our analysis as well as in another recent one @xcite",
    ", we choose the homicide crime to minimize this unwanted aspect of data since , in principle , any kind of demise is recorded by datasus @xcite .",
    "these facts indicate that our results are robust and can be a useful guide for future works on criminality modeling .",
    "we found that the distributions of homicide growth rates exhibit a scale - invariant structure in distinct city sizes , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cumulative ] .",
    "our results show that the distributions of annual , biannual and triannual homicide growth rates are close to a laplace distribution .",
    "we also found that the standard deviations of growth rates have a tendency to decrease as the initial number of crimes increases ( fig .",
    "[ fig : evolution ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : distribution ] ) .",
    "moreover , the mean value of standard deviations are well approximated by power - laws ( fig .",
    "[ fig : law ] ) .",
    "similar results on annual growth rates and power - laws have also been reported for other complex organizations but usually with different values of @xmath50 exponents @xcite .",
    "this parallel between the criminality with complex organizations suggest that there are similarities in their growth dynamics .    as pointed out ,",
    "there is a universality in the way the fluctuations in growth rates of homicides in cities are distributed , even though they differ in many aspects , including the details of people education , public health , cultural development and ethnicity , for example .",
    "our results also indicate that the power - law dependence in this social system could be due to some emerging scenario as well as it occurs in the growth rate dynamics of physical and biological systems , scientific publications , economic and religion activities . here , trying to encompass the above universal features and in a different perspective from several works that have applied a variety of techniques and models in the search for a characterization of crime behavior @xcite , we present motivations to stochastic models proposed in the context of complex organizations in the search for some insight on the study of crime .",
    "although modeling is not the main objective of our empirical investigations , we discuss some aspects of our results that indicate a connection between criminality and the framework of complex organizations",
    ".    we can consider that complex organizations have an internal structure involving subunits @xcite",
    ". also , qualitatively consistent with criminality , for something to occur other things must take place .",
    "these facts go towards a multiplicative process for crime dynamics .",
    "gibrat s model , initially proposed in the context of firm growth @xcite , plays the role of a first attempt to describe the growth of complex organizations . in our crime context , it can be written as @xmath54 , where @xmath9 is the number of homicides in a city in the year @xmath10 , @xmath55 is a random number following a gaussian distribution with zero mean and unitary standard deviation , and @xmath56 is a positive constant .",
    "as we can see , this model assumes that homicide growth is independent of the number of homicides and uncorrelated in time .",
    "unfortunately , this simple approach is not enough to describe our empirical findings such as the tent - shaped distributions in the growth rates and the asymptotic power - laws in the standard deviations .",
    "however , its simplicity could be viewed as a first insight for the comprehension of mechanisms that govern the homicide growth rate .",
    "generalizations of this model can take interaction among the subunits ( e.g. , non - linearity ) and relevance of previous number of homicides ( memory ) into account .",
    "as a final remark of this brief discussion about modeling , we illustrate that , if non - linearity and memory are incorporated to gibrat s model , a substantial improvement is obtained from it . for this illustration , we follow ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. , we replace @xmath57 by @xmath58 , where @xmath59\\,\\epsilon(t)$ ] and @xmath56 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are positive constants ( @xmath62 and @xmath63 recover gibrat s model ) .",
    "the value of memory parameter @xmath60 basically dictates the degree that the probability distributions of homicide growth rates approach to tent - shapes . on the other hand ,",
    "the parameter @xmath61 essentially fixes the @xmath46 value .",
    "thus , this model is enough to reproduce two basic qualitative aspects of our annual homicide growth rate data : the tent - shaped form for the scaled distribution and the power - law behavior for the standard deviation .",
    "our study on homicide growth rates gives a new quantitative characterization of criminality . using a framework of complex organizations",
    ", we have investigated the relation between the number of homicides and the corresponding annual , biannual and triannual logarithmic growth rates for brazilian cities with at least one murder per year from 1980 to 2009 .",
    "we have obtained two main empirical findings based on these three growth rates .",
    "one is that the standard deviations of the growth rates as a function of the number of initial murders follows asymptotic power - law decays .",
    "in addition , if the number of inhabitants is considered instead of the initial value of murders , the power - law behaviors of the standard deviations remains essentially unchanged .",
    "the other main empirical result is that the distributions of growth rates are non - gaussian for distinct size scales but with the same shape , indicating the presence of scaling laws in the dynamics of crime growth rate .",
    "this non - gaussian distribution is well described by the laplace distribution , where the small corrections can be accomplished by stretched gaussians . in a quantitative way ,",
    "all these aspects are summarized in table 1 .",
    "we report that similar empirical behaviors were also observed in a variety of other complex organizations , suggesting a universality and pervasiveness of patterns in their growth dynamics .",
    "since this universal behavior is not dependent of details from the system , models from complex organizations are good candidates to be employed when investigating the crime dynamics . from the literature of these organizations , we consider a model that reproduces two basic qualitative aspects of our data : the non - gaussian distributions and the power - law exponent of the standard deviations .",
    "the quantitative investigations of the emerging behaviors go in the direction that there are some interacting structures where random multiplicative processes take place . furthermore , since many works are still controversial due to difficulties inherent in data collection and also to technical issues in statistical treatment , our results can be a useful guide for further works on criminality modeling .",

    "<S> the increasing number of crimes in areas with large concentrations of people have made cities one of the main sources of violence . </S>",
    "<S> understanding characteristics of how crime rate expands and its relations with the cities size goes beyond an academic question , being a central issue for contemporary society . here , we characterize and analyze quantitative aspects of murders in the period from 1980 to 2009 in brazilian cities . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the distribution of the annual , biannual and triannual logarithmic homicide growth rates exhibit the same functional form for distinct scales , that is , a scale invariant behavior . </S>",
    "<S> we also identify asymptotic power - law decay relations between the standard deviations of these three growth rates and the initial size . </S>",
    "<S> further , we discuss similarities with complex organizations . </S>"
