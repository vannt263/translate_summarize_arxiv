    "polymers in dilute solutions are known to present non - trivial thermodynamic properties @xcite . even in the simplest case of a single flexible homopolymer chain ,",
    "conformational phase transitions are present . among then , the most studied is the coil - globule , or collapse , transition : at high temperatures the excluded volume interaction dominates the system , which stays in a swollen coil conformation .",
    "as temperature is lowered , monomer - monomer attractive interactions prevail , giving rise to a collapsed ( globule ) configuration @xcite .",
    "these effects cancel each other at the so - called @xmath3-point and a continuous coil - globule transition takes place at temperature @xmath5 , which is known to be a tricritical point @xcite .    the collapse transition has been modeled by interacting self - avoiding walks ( isaws ) , where , beyond the excluded volume , a short - range attractive force between non - consecutive monomers in the chain is considered @xcite . on the lattice ,",
    "the standard isaw model consists in assign an attractive interaction between non - bounded nearest - neighbor ( nn ) monomers in the walk .",
    "this model has been extensively studied by different approaches ( see tables i and ii of refs . @xcite and @xcite for estimates of @xmath5 in 3d and 2d , respectively ) .",
    "the radius of gyration ( or , equivalently , the end - to - end distance ) , @xmath6 , of a chain with @xmath7 monomers is expected to scale near the criticality as @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the tricritical metric and crossover exponents , respectively , @xmath9 and @xmath10 is a scaling function , which behaves as @xcite @xmath11 therefore , in general , @xmath12 , with exponents @xmath13 in the coil phase , @xmath14 at the @xmath3-point and @xmath15 in the globule phase .",
    "the @xmath16 exponent assume the exact flory value @xmath17 @xcite in two dimensions ( @xmath18 ) , but deviate from this in @xmath19 , where it is @xmath20 ( for a recent reference see @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath3-point critical exponents have the exact values @xmath21 and @xmath22 in @xmath18 @xcite . in three dimensions , which is the upper critical dimension , the exponents assume the mean - field values @xmath23 @xcite and logarithmic corrections to scaling are expected @xcite .    beyond that classical isaw model , other approaches",
    "have been employed to model the polymer collapse transition .",
    "for example , collapsing walks can be obtained by constraining the walk atmospheric statistics , which restrict its degrees of freedom ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "another example is the multiple monomer per site ( mms ) model by krawczyk et al .",
    "@xcite , where lattice sites can be occupied by up to @xmath24 monomers . for @xmath25 , monte carlo simulations provided a rich ( canonical ) phase diagram for this model with coil and globule phases separated either by a @xmath3-line ( a continuous line of @xmath3-points ) or by a line of discontinuous ( first - order ) transition , both matching at a multicritical point @xcite .",
    "although it is well accepted that the nature of coil - globule transition changes in this model , the existence of a discontinuous transition had been questioned in @xcite .",
    "a generalized isaw model has also been used to model semiflexible polymers , where a repulsive bending force , associated to a bending energy @xmath26 , is introduced in the isaw model ( see @xcite and references therein ) . beyond the coil and globule phases ( separated by a @xmath3-line ) , this model presents a crystalline phase and discontinuous globule - crystal ( at small @xmath27 ) and coil - crystal ( at large @xmath27 ) transitions are also present in its phase diagram @xcite .",
    "more recently , another generalization of the isaw model was proposed by lee et al .",
    "@xcite , which considered attractive interactions , with energies @xmath28 and @xmath29 , between nn and next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) monomers , respectively .",
    "they calculate exactly the partition function zeros for chains with up to @xmath30 monomers on the square lattice and showed that the crossover exponent is not affected by the nnn interaction .",
    "therefore , it was suggested that the universality class of this system is the same of the simple isaw model ( @xmath31 ) - hereafter called the @xmath3 universality class .    since in real polymers",
    "the interactions could be larger than one lattice parameter ( typical monomer - monomer distances ) @xcite , it is very important to determine how robust is the @xmath3 universality class to changes in the range ( by including nnn ones ) and nature of interactions .",
    "in order to do this , here we study the model of lee et al .",
    "@xcite on the square and cubic lattices via monte carlo simulations . growing equilibrium chains with the pruned - enriched rosenbluth method ( perm ) @xcite , polymers with up to 5000 monomers are studied in a broad range of energies , including negative ( repulsive interaction ) ones",
    ". the canonical phase diagrams ( both in @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) display coil and globule phases separated by lines of @xmath3-points , even in repulsive interaction regions .",
    "thus , the collapsed phase exists even for negative nn ( nnn ) energies with large enough positive nnn ( nn ) ones .",
    "in the square lattice , the @xmath3-line has an almost linear behavior in @xmath32 plane , similarly to the findings of lee et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the rest of this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ defmod ] we define the model and the simulation algorithm .",

    "[ conclusions ] our final discussions and conclusions are summarized .",
    "we consider a generalized interacting self - avoiding walk model on square and cubic lattices , where an energy @xmath28 is assigned to each pair of non - bounded nearest - neighbor ( nn ) monomers and an energy @xmath29 is associated to each pair of next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) monomers .",
    "thus , for a given configuration @xmath33 of a chain with @xmath7 monomers , we have the total energy @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 gives the number of pair of nn and nnn monomers in configuration @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "since the number of conformations of size @xmath7 , @xmath38 , increases exponentially with @xmath7 @xcite , it is very difficult to calculate exactly the canonical partition function @xmath39 for large polymers .",
    "therefore , we will estimate @xmath40 employing monte carlo ( mc ) simulations",
    ".    there are several mc methods to efficiently sample equilibrium configurations of lattice polymers ( see @xcite for a review ) . here",
    ", we will use an improvement of the classical rosenbluth method @xcite , namely , the pruned - enriched rosenbluth method ( perm ) @xcite .",
    "this approach has been employed in several systems and is particularly useful in the study of collapsing polymers @xcite .    in the rosenbluth method ,",
    "a chain is grown by trying to insert new monomers at _ empty _ nn sites of its end .",
    "this growth follows until the length @xmath7 is attained or the chain becomes trapped , i. e. , all the nn sites of its end are already occupied .",
    "since only empty sites are tried , there is a bias in the chain , which should be corrected by associating a weight to the generated configuration . considering a thermal ( interacting ) chain with @xmath41 monomers ,",
    "if @xmath42 is the number of empty nn sites of the monomer @xmath41 , the @xmath43 of these sites could be chosen with probability @xmath44 , where @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the rosenbluth weight of a configuration @xmath37 with @xmath7 monomers is given by @xmath46 alternatively , we can choose the @xmath43 free nn site with the same probability @xmath47 and replace the `` local '' weight by @xmath48 this is the method we use in this work .",
    "if @xmath49 walks are started , then , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the number of successfully generated chains of length @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , the expected value of the quantity @xmath52 is @xmath53 .",
    "we notice that , although rosenbluth method can efficiently sample small chains ( typically , @xmath54 in the square lattice ) , for larger ones the attrition of walks becomes a problem .",
    "moreover , the distribution of weights can become so wide that few ( rare ) chains with large @xmath55 will dominates the statistical averages , leading to unreliable results .    in the perm algorithm ,",
    "the growth proceeds as above , however , at each stage of the growth we make @xmath24 copies of the chain , if its weight is larger than a parameter @xmath56 .",
    "each copy follows growing independently , but , once copies are made , their weights are reduce by a factor @xmath24 . here",
    "we use @xmath57 , i. e. , we duplicate the chains with @xmath58 . in the same way , at each stage of the growth , we prune chains , with probability @xmath59 , whose weight is smaller than a parameter @xmath60 . if the chain with @xmath61 is not pruned , its weight is increased by a factor @xmath62 . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , good results can be obtained fixing @xmath63 , thus , we use this parameter here .",
    "we present results for chains with up to 5000 monomers . for each set of nn and nnn energies ,",
    "we run averages over up to @xmath64 started configurations .",
    "the critical properties of the model are obtained in terms of the variables @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , we will determine the critical ( @xmath3- ) points , for example , fixing @xmath67 and varying @xmath68 , or vice - versa .      according to eq .",

    "[ fig1]a shows @xmath71 for @xmath72 and different chain lengths .",
    "although we observe a dependence of @xmath70 with the polymer length , at critical points it should be independent of @xmath7 . thus , from the crossing points of the curves for large @xmath7 , we estimate the critical exponent @xmath73 , which is @xmath74 for @xmath72 . a similar behavior was found in the whole range of parameters analyzed here @xmath75 and @xmath76 , which allows us to determine the exponent @xmath0 along the transition line .",

    "similarly to the square lattice , @xmath4 decreases with @xmath67 and increases with @xmath68 , but here there is a clear inflection in @xmath4 versus @xmath67 curve .",

    "the critical parameters @xmath145 and @xmath146 , obtained in the same ways of the previous subsection , are summarized in the phase diagram depicted in fig .",
    "in contrast to the square lattice , the whole @xmath3-line is clearly non - linear here , though an almost linear behavior is observed within and around the attractive region , where @xmath147 is found .",
    "we notice that in the cubic lattice each monomer inside the chain has 4 nn and 12 nnn sites which could be occupied and contribute to the energy of the chain .",
    "thus , in average , for each nn interaction there will be approximately three nnn ones in the globular configuration , explaining @xmath148 in the @xmath3-line .",
    "the values of @xmath145 and @xmath146 are smaller than the ones found in the square lattice , in the region of attractive forces , meaning that the @xmath3 temperatures are larger here .",
    "for example , @xmath149 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 , for unitary energies and @xmath100 .",
    "the first value are in good agreement with the ones typically reported in literature ( see table i of ref .",
    "the large values of @xmath5 in the presence of nnn interactions are expected , since the number of nnn sites is twice the nn ones in the cubic lattice .",
    "thus , the stronger cooperative effects of nnn monomers will facilitate the collapse .",
    "in summary , we have studied a generalized isaw model where next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) interactions exists together the nn ones .",
    "although the nnn energies change the collapse transition points , this transition is found to be always in @xmath3 class , at least in the set of parameters analyzed .",
    "namely , critical exponents @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 in good agreement with the @xmath3 ones were found along the ( transition ) @xmath3-line , in both square and cubic lattices . in the first one ,",
    "the @xmath3-line seems to have a linear behavior in the phase diagram , as already observed for this model @xcite . along the @xmath3-lines , the growth parameters , from the partition function , have monotonic behaviors decreasing ( increasing ) with @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "we remark that a single @xmath3-line in the whole phase diagrams is _ per si _ a very interesting result .",
    "although this is expected in the region of attractive forces ( @xmath81 and @xmath129 ) , when attractive and repulsive interactions compete ( in the regions @xmath152 and @xmath129 or @xmath153 and @xmath154 ) the existence of a @xmath3-line is not so obvious . particularly , in the mms model",
    "( discussed in the introduction ) , the competition between attractive and repulsive forces between two and three monomers ( in a site ) changes the nature of the coil - globule transition in that model @xcite .",
    "however , in mms model the energies are associated to on - site monomers , instead of neighbors as in our model . moreover , since self - avoidance is relaxed in mms model there is a large difference between the entropies of both models , which certainly explains the different behaviors found .    as a final remark",
    ", we notice that the region with @xmath154 in our phase diagrams leads to semiflexible polymers , because a repulsive nnn force inhibit the formation of bends in the chains .",
    "therefore , a transition to a crystalline phase could be expected there , which we do not observe . however , the repulsive nnn interaction in our model is different from a bending energy of semiflexible models @xcite , since the first also inhibit the formation of pairs of nonconsecutive nn monomers in simple cubic lattices .",
    "therefore , the change from a @xmath3-line to a direct ( first - order ) coil - crystal transition possible does not exists here , or appears in a region of @xmath155 , which is very difficult to be accessed with our simulation method .",

    "<S> we study a generalized interacting self - avoiding walk ( isaw ) model with nearest- and next nearest - neighbor ( nn and nnn ) interactions on the square and cubic lattices . in both dimensions , </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagrams show coil and globule phases separated by continuous transition lines . along these lines </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the metric @xmath0 , crossover @xmath1 and entropic @xmath2 exponents , all of them in good agreement with the exact values of the @xmath3 universality class </S>",
    "<S> . therefore , the introduction of nnn interactions does not change the class of the isaw model , which still exists even for repulsive forces . </S>",
    "<S> the growth parameters @xmath4 are shown to change monotonically with temperature along the @xmath3-lines . in the square lattice , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3-line has an almost linear behavior , which was not found in the cubic one . </S>",
    "<S> although the region of repulsive nnn interactions , with attractive nn ones , leads to stiff polymers , no evidence of a transition to a crystalline phase was found . </S>"
