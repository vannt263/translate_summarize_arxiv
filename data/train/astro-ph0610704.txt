    "omega centauri ( @xmath0 cen ) has been the subject of intense interest over the years , as it possesses several distinctive features that differentiate it significantly from other members of the galactic globular cluster system .",
    "firstly , it is the most massive of the globular clusters , with a total absolute visual magnitude of @xmath910.29 @xcite , comparable to low - mass dwarf galaxies .",
    "the cluster posesses a high internal rotation velocity of @xmath108 km / s@xmath11 , @xcite with a central one - dimensional velocity dispersion of @xmath1015@xmath920 km / s@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this high rotation and mass ( 2.5@xmath60.3@xmath210@xmath12m@xmath13 , @xcite ) gives the cluster a moderate ellipticity and a long relaxation time @xcite .",
    "an investigation into the global dynamics of the cluster can be found in @xcite .",
    "perhaps most importantly , @xmath0 cen is well known to display a complex stellar population , with a distinct metallicity spread among its stars @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the cluster has undergone a star formation and chemical enrichment process that has been occuring over an extended period of time . using helium abundances",
    ", @xcite has shown that the cluster has three distinct stellar populations , with corresponding metallicities ranging from @xmath91.7 to @xmath90.6 dex , with the majority of the stars ( 80@xmath14 ) belonging to the metal - poor branch .",
    "these values correspond to an age spread of around 2 - 3 gyr .",
    "furthermore , only the metal - poor populations ( [ fe / h]@xmath15@xmath91.2 ) seem to show evidence of rotation @xcite , although @xcite find no significant difference between the two populations .",
    "all observations suggest that the populations have different dynamical origins .",
    "the origin of the cluster has been the subject of much debate , with the suggestion by several groups that it is the remnant of a dwarf galaxy disrupted by the milky way @xcite . indeed ,",
    "@xcite postulate that the second generation population of @xmath0 cen could have been formed from gas ejected from primordial stars which surrounded the cluster when it was once the nucleus of a dwarf galaxy .",
    "the lack of observed mass segregation in the cluster @xcite may be further evidence that @xmath0 cen was orginally a more massive object . based on the current mass of @xmath0 cen and a distance of 5.5kpc ,",
    "@xcite calculate a central relaxation time of @xmath106.6 gyr , approximately a factor of two smaller than the cluster age , and thus expect there to be some observable mass segregation in the cluster center .",
    "however , @xcite do not find any segregation in the cluster blue stragglers .",
    "they suggest two possible resolutions : that @xmath0 cen was originally a much larger dwarf galaxy with a correspondingly larger relaxation time , and/or that the large rotation in @xmath0 cen has increased the relaxation time , since angular momentum will keep stars out of the core .",
    "further evidence of an external origin is that the cluster follows a highly bound retrograde orbit @xcite .",
    "one way in which the cluster dynamical evolution can be studied is via variable stars , particularly eclipsing binaries .",
    "detached binaries located at the cluster main sequence turnoff allow direct determination of the properties of turnoff stars in the cluster , important for the verification ( or otherwise ) of theoretical cluster isochrones .",
    "the detection of any new detached m - dwarf binaries also allows comparison with models of stellar evolution @xcite .",
    "binaries also provide calculations of stellar masses , radii , ages , luminosities @xcite and information on the evolution of both contact and detached systems .",
    "hence , detection of new variable stars ( particularly in the relatively understudied outer halo of the cluster ) is useful for multiple scientific goals in furthering the understanding of the @xmath0 cen stellar content .",
    "previous ground - based searches for cluster variable stars centered on the core have uncovered a rich population of many different types of variables , including sx phe stars , eclipsing binaries ( detached , semi - detached and contact systems ) , many rr lyrae , spotted variables ( variability associated with the rotational modulation of large starspots ) and long period variables .",
    "the ogle project has been the most prolific of these searches , with a total of 394 variables in their online catalogs @xcite .",
    "other deep variability searches have been more limited to the cluster core , for example @xcite .",
    "the work presented here constitutes the results of a 25-night search for variability in a wide field centered on @xmath0 cen which extends further from the cluster core and to deeper photometry than any previous ground - based variability survey .",
    "the search extends to @xmath1050@xmath14 of the cluster tidal radius ( in a single exposure ) , corresponding to @xmath106.8 times the cluster half mass radius @xcite .",
    "hence the observed field contains a large majority of the bound cluster stars and has excellent prospects for the discovery of new variable systems , both in the cluster and the field .",
    "the main motivation for the observations is to search for transiting ` hot jupiter ' planets in the cluster , and is the second part of a search for such planets in both 47 tucanae @xcite and @xmath0 cen .",
    "these two clusters are unique in that they display sufficient star brightness and total star numbers for meaningful statistics to be gained from a ground - based campaign with a telescope of moderate aperture .",
    "the results of the hot jupiter search in @xmath0 cen will be published in a separate paper @xcite .",
    "section 2 of this work describes the observations and data reduction techniques employed to produce the total image dataset .",
    "section 3 presents a description of the method used for time - series production and a discussion of the resultant photometric precision .",
    "section 4 describes the cluster color - magnitude dataset and astrometry , along with a description of the theoretical isochrones produced for the cluster .",
    "section 5 details the methods used to detect the variable stars and section 6 presents the variable star catalog itself , with descriptions of the color - magnitude distribution of the variables , their spatial distributions and a discussion of the resulting catalog detection limits .",
    "section 7 describes the analysis of individual variables ( eclipsing binaries , rr lyrae and miscellaneous pulsators ) , and section 8 presents the paper summary and conclusions .",
    "the image dataset was obtained using the australian national university ( anu ) 40-inch ( 1 m ) telescope located at siding spring observatory , fitted with the wide field imager ( wfi ) .",
    "this telescope and detector combination permits a 52@xmath1@xmath252@xmath1 ( 0.75 deg@xmath16 ) field of view , capable of observing a large fraction of the cluster with a single exposure , thus maximising the number of sampled stars for lightcurve production .",
    "wfi consists of a 4@xmath22 array of 2048@xmath24096 pixel back - illuminated ccds , arranged to produce a total array of 8k @xmath2 8k pixels .",
    "the detector scale is 0@xmath17.38 pixel@xmath11 at the 1 m telescope cassegrain focus , allowing for suitable sampling of the point spread function ( psf ) with the seeing limitations of the site .",
    "our exposure times were fixed at 300 seconds resulting in excellent temporal resolution in the dataset .",
    "the main aim of the project is the detection of ` hot jupiter ' planet transits against @xmath0 cen main sequence stars , which requires a signal - to - photon - noise ratio ( s / n ) of 200 or more for sufficient photometric precision ( @xmath101.5@xmath14 ) at v@xmath1818.0 ( typical v magnitude of the target stars in these crowded fields ) .",
    "this requirement therefore defined the observing strategy . in order to achieve this with short exposure times ,",
    "a broadband v+r filter was used , covering the combined wavelength range of the cousins v and r filters . this same telescope and detector combination",
    "was used for a deep search for planet transits in the halo of 47 tucanae , yielding a high significance null result @xcite .",
    "a total of 69 newly discovered variable stars were also found in that search @xcite . from this previous experience a star of v@xmath1818.5 in 2@xmath7 seeing ( typical of the site ) yields a photon noise s / n of 220 with a 7-day moon and 165 at times of bright moon in a five minute exposure .",
    "@xmath0 cen was observed for a total of 25 contiguous nights , from 2003 may 2 to 2003 may 27 with the field centered at r.a @xmath18 13@xmath1926@xmath2045.89@xmath21 , decl .",
    "@xmath18 @xmath947@xmath2228@xmath136.7@xmath7 .",
    "the position of the centers of all ccds can be found in table1 .",
    "a total of 875 images of the cluster were obtained during this time , with an average temporal resolution of 6 minutes and covering an average 9 hours for each good night .",
    "each image was independently checked at the telescope for cosmetic quality , and any with bad seeing ( @xmath233.5@xmath7 images ) , satellite trails or other adverse effects were discarded from the dataset . of this total database ,",
    "90@xmath14 were deemed useful for the analysis , having suitable seeing and small telescope offsets to minimise star loss .",
    "a total of 787 images ( with average seeing of 2.1@xmath7 ) were subsequently used to produce 109,726 time - series via differential imaging analysis ( dia , @xcite ) across the whole field for a detailed variability analysis .",
    "initial image reduction was performed according to standard practise within the mscred package of iraf .",
    "this incorporated region trimming , overscan correction , bias correction , flat - field and dark current subtraction .",
    "the images were then checked for flatness and overall quality and became available for the main photometric analysis and time - series production .",
    "in order to obtain high precision photometry on relatively faint targets in the crowded field of a globular cluster , differential photometry was performed on the dataset .",
    "this method was originally described as an optimal point - spread - function ( psf ) matching algorithm by @xcite , and was subsequently modified by @xcite for use in detecting microlensing events .",
    "a detailed description of the method and software pipeline can be found in wozniak s paper and only the main steps shall be summarized here .",
    "the process of matching the stellar psf throughout a large database of images dramatically reduces the systematic effects of varying atmospheric conditions on resultant photometric precision , allowing ground - based observations the best chance of detecting small brightness variations in faint targets .",
    "dia is also one of the optimal photometric methods for dealing with crowded fields , as a larger number of pixels contain information on any psf differences as the number of stars increases , hence improving the psf matching process .",
    "flux measurements of the stars are made via profile photometry on a master template frame , produced via the median - combining of a large number of the best quality images with small offsets .",
    "this template image is used as the zero - point in the output time - series .",
    "the positions of the stars are found on a reference image , usually the image with the best seeing conditions , and all subsequent images in the dataset , including the template , are shifted to match .",
    "the best psf - matching kernel is then found , and each registered image is subtracted from the template , with the residual subtraction generally being dominated by photon noise .",
    "any object that has changed in brightness between the image and the template is given away as a bright or dark spot .",
    "differential photometry produces time - series measured in differential counts , a linear flux unit from which a constant reference flux ( taken from the template ) has been subtracted . in order to convert to a standard magnitude system",
    ", the total number of counts for each star was measured using the psf photometry package of daophot within iraf , with the same images and parameters as used in the photometry code .",
    "the time - series were then converted using these flux values into magnitude units via the relation :    @xmath24 $ ]    where @xmath25 is the total flux of star @xmath26 on the template image and @xmath27 is the original difference flux in the time series as produced with the photometric code .",
    "the pixel coordinates of all visible stars were determined separately from the reference frame via daofind within iraf , and the profile photometry was then extracted from the subtracted frames at those determined positions . in this way ,",
    "a total of 109,726 stars were identified and their time - series produced , across the whole wfi field , which then became the subject of analysis . the time - series",
    "are hence presented in this work in v+r differential magnitude units , and can be converted to the standard v system via the calculation of color terms .",
    "this requires another set of observations which is not directly related to the paper at hand .",
    "each of the four outer ccds of wfi were analysed in half ccd chunks , each half producing an average of 9,500 time - series . for the crowded core of the cluster ,",
    "the number of stars becomes very large and , due to computational limitations , a different strategy was employed . for the core regions ,",
    "the images were analysed individually with dia in 360 individual subframes , 90 per ccd .",
    "the locations of these subframes were chosen so that no stars were lost at the edges of the subframes , covering the entire core region of the cluster , except those regions that were affected by telescope offsets during observing ( a 160 pixel border surrounding each ccd ) .",
    "fig.[rmsplot ] presents the resultant dia - derived photometric precision , measured as root - mean - square scatter ( rms ) , for a total of 104,381 stars which were cross - identified with the cluster cmd dataset .",
    "the left panel displays the rms of 60,123 stars within 13.5@xmath1 of the cluster core and the right panel shows the rms of 44,258 stars outside this radius .",
    "the difference between these two crowding regimes is marginal , indicating the ability of dia to handle fields of differing stellar density .",
    "the mean total star and background noise contribution is also plotted , illustrating that the photometry is photon - noise - limited to v@xmath1017.0 .",
    "the position of the cluster main sequence turnoff ( msto ) is marked to indicate where the cluster stars become members of the main sequence .",
    "to the left of this line , therefore , lie likely red giant branch and foreground galactic disk stars .",
    "it can be seen that the photometric accuracy is equal to 2@xmath14 ( 0.02 magnitudes ) at v@xmath1018.5 for both crowding regions of the data , increasing to 4@xmath14 ( 0.04 magnitudes ) at v@xmath1019.0 . by considering the stellar radius for cluster main sequence stars as a function of v",
    ", the photometry allows detection of transiting giant planets down to v@xmath1019.5 .",
    "using the same telescope / detector combination and pointing , a v , v - i color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) totalling 203,892 stars was produced for the observed field .",
    "this enabled detected variable stars and transiting systems to be placed on the standard v and i magnitude system , aiding in the determination of their likely nature .",
    "three images in v and three in i were combined to produce the dataset , with all images being taken within 30 minutes to minimise the effect of variability on the resulting magnitudes and colors .",
    "fig.[cmdplot ] presents the diagram produced for all ccds .",
    "the output daophot photometric errors in both v and v - i are marked as errorbars as a function of v magnitude .",
    "the magnitude range of this diagram ( 12.0@xmath15v@xmath1521.0 ) covers a large range of stellar mass both in the cluster and the contaminating galactic disk .",
    "the cmd calibration was performed via matching of stellar astrometry from our catalog to that of @xcite ( also taken with the anu 1 m and wfi combination in v and i ) , as standard field data were unavailable .",
    "the difference in v and i between our uncalibrated data and the @xcite calibrated data was measured for each of the matched stars ( totalling more than 20,000 ) in each ccd independently ; the resultant calibration accuracy was @xmath150.03 magnitudes",
    ".    also overplotted on fig.[cmdplot ] are three theoretical @xcite isochrones used to simulate the stellar populations of the cluster .",
    "these isochrones were used to determine stellar mass and radius values for cluster main sequence stars for use in the hot jupiter transit search .",
    "they also allow investigation into whether any particular type of variable is preferentially located within a particular population .",
    "the metallicity and relative fraction of each cluster population , as taken from @xcite , is also plotted .",
    "astrometry was obtained for a total of 212,959 stars identified in the v band image of the cluster , and 243,466 stars in the i - band .",
    "a search of the usno ccd astrograph catalog ( ucac1 ) was carried out for astrometric standard stars within the field .",
    "several hundred such stars were successfully identified , producing an accurate determination of the astrometric solution for the stars in each ccd , with measured uncertainties of 0.25@xmath7 .    in order to display",
    "the extent of our field of view with respect to the cluster , fig.[clusterastrom ] presents both the total derived v band astrometric dataset ( light shading ) and the total time - series dataset ( dark shading ) , plotted as @xmath28ra and @xmath28dec in degrees from the location of the cluster core .",
    "the eight ccds of wfi are clear , as is the differing stellar densities encountered in the dataset .",
    "the time - series database ( overplotted with darker shading ) does not have the completeness of the total astrometry .",
    "the gaps are in regions where poor photometry resulted due to the presence of bright saturated stars or repeated measurements could not be obtained in a border surrounding each chip due to telescope offsets during the run .",
    "a total of 109,726 lightcurves were produced in the sampled regions .",
    "also overplotted on fig.[clusterastrom ] as ellipses are the locations of the cluster core radius ( innermost ellipse ) , the cluster half - mass radius ( central ellipse ) and the position of 50@xmath14 of the cluster tidal radius ( outer ellipse , the extent of the search ) .",
    "the ellipses have been plotted with the @xmath0 cen ellipticity and cluster parameters of @xcite .",
    "fig.[completeness ] shows the fraction of stars for which time - series information is available compared to the total astrometric database , as a function of radial distance from the cluster core .",
    "our time - series database has an optimal region of @xmath1018@xmath1 to @xmath1032@xmath1 from the core .",
    "the decrease in completeness in the core and in the outer regions of the field are due to the gaps in the spatial coverage as seen in fig.[clusterastrom ] .",
    "in order to automatically detect the variable stars in the total time - series database , two search methods were used . for any search",
    ", two main factors must be taken into account , namely the distribution of the observations in time and the shape of the variability for which the search is targeted .",
    "first , we applied the lomb - scargle periodogram ( lsp ) @xcite in which a fourier power spectrum is produced with the same statistical properties as standard power spectra , but successfully overcomes the problems caused by diurnal gaps .",
    "the method produces a spike ( with a frequency of 2@xmath29/@xmath30 ) in the output power spectrum if a significant periodicity ( @xmath30 ) is detected .",
    "the significance ( in multiples of the standard deviation of the spectrum , @xmath31 ) is determined for each datapoint independently .",
    "if any datapoint is over a set detection threshold , a variable star candidate is flagged . by experimentation",
    ", it was found that for our dataset setting this detection threshold at @xmath412@xmath2@xmath31 produces a variable star recoverability of 1 real variable per @xmath101,000 stars searched , with a corresponding false detection probability ( per star ) of 0.002@xmath14 . in this manner ,",
    "all stars in the time - series database were searched and the first sample of variable stars identified .    however , this method is only of benefit when searching for sinusoidal variability , and will miss detached systems and other non - sinusoidal stars . to overcome this ,",
    "a second search was implemented on all stars using an application of the analysis of variance ( aov ) statistic ( o.tamuz , private communication ) .",
    "a full description of this detection method can be found in @xcite . via this method",
    ", the data are phase - wrapped with a trial period and then grouped into phase bins . a one - way statistical analysis of variance",
    "is then performed on the result .",
    "this statistical procedure is repeated for a fixed range of test periods for each star , producing a series of significances and their corresponding periodicities .",
    "the final output for each star is the peak periodicity and its corresponding significance .",
    "period estimates for the detected variables were derived by measuring the position of the highest significance peak in either the output power spectrum or the peak aov statistic periodicity ( in day units to 4 decimal places ) and phase - wrapping the star at that period .",
    "the period was then tweaked manually to produce the smallest amount of scatter on the plotted lightcurve .",
    "the difference between the raw measured period and the final plotted period was smaller than 0.001 day in all cases , an indication of the accuracy of the detection methods .",
    "as a result of analysing the whole dataset of 109,726 lightcurves , a total of 530 candidates were produced with a significant ( @xmath412@xmath31 ) periodicity as determined via lsp along with 2324 candidates with high significance ( @xmath48@xmath31 ) as determined with aov .",
    "the aov candidates include all of those detected via lsp .",
    "all candidates were then examined by eye both in their ` raw ' un - phase - wrapped format and phase - wrapped to their peak detected periodicity . if the phase - wrapped lightcurve displayed discernable regular variability at the periodicities detected , they were flagged as variable stars .",
    "the vast majority of the candidates ( particularly those identified by aov ) were found to be attributed to common systematic effects inherent to the data , associated with stars close to the magnitude limits of the dataset .    in all ,",
    "a total of 187 secure variable stars were identified , across the whole wfi field and are presented in table.2 .",
    "the final catalog consists of 58 eclipsing binaries ( ecb ) , 69 rr lyrae stars , 36 long period variables ( lpvs , p@xmath42d ) and 24 miscellaneous variables including 15 sx phoenicis ( @xmath32 scuti ) stars . from their locations on the cluster cmd ,",
    "most of these systems are expected to be cluster members .",
    "follow - up radial velocity observations are needed to confirm memberships . of this sample ,",
    "81 of these variables are new discoveries as indicated by cross - matching astrometry with the @xcite catalog .",
    "the time - series data are available on the electronic edition of aj .",
    "all of the detected variables were compared to the online catalog of @xcite in order to identify new discoveries .",
    "a comparison was made of the published astrometry , period , type and v magnitudes of the known variables to the corresponding values derived in this work .",
    "we were able to match 106 of our variables with those of @xcite .",
    "fig.[comparevars ] shows the results of the comparisons made for these 106 recovered variables .",
    "the zeropoint was determined along with the standard deviation and has been overplotted for all parts of the figure for comparison .",
    "the comparisons are all consistent with zero .",
    "all matches within three arcseconds in both ra and dec were classified as recovered variables , with the difference in derived astrometry both for ra and dec seen in the top left panel of the figure .",
    "the final matching threshold was chosen by varying threshold , and comparing the number and period determinations of matches between the two datasets .",
    "three arcseconds was found to produce the largest number of matches with the periods being consistent , a larger threshold introduces mis - matches .",
    "the average of the astrometry differences was found to be 0.005@xmath60.005@xmath7 for the ra astrometry and 0.232@xmath60.233@xmath7 for dec .",
    "there is a slight systematic offset of 0.23@xmath7 in declination between our catalog and that of @xcite .",
    "the sample of stars for which a large offset in astrometry is seen ( num 40 - 60 ) is due to those variables being located in the most crowded regions of the cluster .",
    "the top right panel shows the difference in derived period for these 106 stars .",
    "all recovered variables except six have periods presented here within 0.0005d of those published by @xcite , with an average very close to zero and standard deviation of 0.0002d .",
    "the remainder are all long period variables with a larger error in their period determination , due to incomplete phase coverage .",
    "the bottom panel of fig.[comparevars ] shows the difference in v magnitude as determined from our cmd dataset , and the average v magnitude as determined by @xcite .",
    "the plot shows some scatter around the zeropoint with an amplitude @xmath100.5 magnitudes , and has an average variation of -0.01@xmath60.42 mags .",
    "the range in v magnitude undertaken by the variable during the course of it s variation is plotted as an errorbar for each point .",
    "our measured v magnitude zero - point is within these errobars for the vast majority of cases , indicating that the difference in v between our dataset and that of @xcite ( and the subsequent 0.42 magnitude error ) is caused by the various phases that each variable was undertaking when our cmd dataset was obtained .",
    "a comparison in variable type was also made . for the 106 recovered variables ,",
    "all but three have been assigned the same classification as in @xcite .",
    "these three ( v42 , v43 and v121 ) are classified as eclipsing binaries in this work , but were classed as rr lyrae in @xcite .",
    "the time - series for these three can be seen in fig.[varplot2 ] and [ varplot5 ] .",
    "for the cases of v42 and v121 , the primary and secondary eclipses have a different depth ( and shape ) , indicating their likeliness as an binary system .",
    "v43 seemingly displays secondary variations at times of maximum brightness , as seen in other binary lightcurves ( ie , v13 and v178 ) .",
    "two of our variables were classified as unknown in the @xcite catalog , and here are classified as an eclipsing binary ( v84 ) and a long period variable ( v104 ) .",
    "fig.[linecmd ] shows the distribution of the variable stars overlaid on the @xcite theoretical stellar isochrones of @xmath0 cen as determined with parameters taken from @xcite .",
    "three isochrones were produced in total , each with the differing metallicities of the three distinct populations observed in @xmath0 cen .",
    "eclipsing binaries are marked as blue triangles , rr lyrae are plotted as green squares , the long period variables are plotted as red hexagons , with the miscellaeous variables ( @xmath32 scuti s and other pulsators ) marked as magenta pentagons .",
    "the eclipsing binary sample can be seen to follow the expected locations of blue straggler stars and binary main sequence members ( located redward of the cluster main sequence ) .",
    "a few systems appear to lie on the cluster subgiant / red giant branch ; if they are members , these stars are likely composed of at least one evolved component .",
    "three systems seemingly lie on the cluster msto , although none are detached systems . these are hence less suitable than detached systems for determining the properties of turnoff stars in the cluster .",
    "the rr lyrae stars are seen to lie in the vast majority on the cluster hb instability strip , strongly implying their cluster membership . the other rr lyrae lying off this sequence ( those fainter and redder ) we have classified as galactic halo contamination ( see section7.2 ) .",
    "many of the detected long period variables ( lpvs ) appear to be associated with the cluster red giant branch , indicating their likely nature as evolved pulsators with cluster membership .",
    "the spatial distribution of the variable catalog , measured as the @xmath28ra and @xmath28dec in degrees for each variable from the core of the cluster , is presented in fig.[varsastrom ] . also marked as ellipses are the core radius ( inner ellipse ) , the cluster half - mass - radius ( middle ellipse ) and 50@xmath14 of the cluster tidal radius ( outer ellipse , the limit of the search ) produced with the same scale as fig.[clusterastrom ] .",
    "each panel of fig.[varsastrom ] displays the distribution of a different type of variable .",
    "panel ` a ' shows the distribution of the total catalog : those variables recovered from the catalog of @xcite are marked as filled circles , new discoveries are hence open circles .",
    "the new discoveries are located mainly in the outer regions of the field , due to the wide field employed in our search .",
    "the apparent gap in the distribution seen at @xmath28ra@xmath100.05 is not real , but is due to the incompleness of the lightcurve database at this location caused by telescope drift during observations .",
    "these limits to the regions where lightcurve production was imparied can be seen as the darker shading on fig.[clusterastrom ] .",
    "the vast majority of previously known variables that were not identified in our survey are either located in these parts of the dataset in the inner core of the cluster , a region to which this work is not sensitive .",
    "panel ` b ' displays the spatial distribution of the detected ecb stars .",
    "it can be seen that a slight majority ( 60@xmath14 ) are located towards the west of the cluster core .",
    "panel ` c ' shows the corresponding distribution of the detected rr lyrae stars .",
    "these stars appear to be more centrally concentrated than the other types of variables , but this is due to incompleteness of fainter stars towards the cluster core , which truncates the frequency of the fainter ecb and lpv variables . as the ecb and lpv s appear more homogeneously distributed over the cluster field , there do seem to be more ecb and lpv s than rr lyrae in the outer regions of the cluster .",
    "panel ` d ' is the distribution of the lpv stars .",
    "fig.[amplitudes ] presents the total amplitude of each detected variable star plotted as a function of its corresponding v magnitude , in order to provide information on the detection limits of the catalog .",
    "any variable star with an amplitude greater than or equal to the position of the dotted line is very likely to be detected in the dataset by the two detection methods described previously .",
    "hence , at v@xmath1016.0 , this detection limit is about 0.015 magnitudes ( 1.5@xmath14 ) , while at v@xmath1020.0 , the detection limit is 0.31 magnitudes ( 33@xmath14 ) .",
    "phase - wrapped differential v+r magnitude lightcurves of the detected variable stars are presented in figs.[varplot1 ] @xmath9[varplot8 ] in order of discovery .",
    "overplotted for each variable star is its identification number and determined period in days .",
    "the catalog as a whole is tabulated in table2 .",
    "those variables marked with ` @xmath9 ' in the last column of table2 are new discoveries .      for the 58 ecb stars ,",
    "it is clear that examples of contact ( ie , v2 ) , semi - detached ( ie , v37 ) and detached ( ie , v59 ) configurations are all present in the @xmath0 cen field .",
    "these are classified considering the presence ( or lack thereof ) of features in the time - series indicating tidal distortion of the stellar components , the derived period , and the presence of any datapoints between individual eclipses , indicating physical separation of the stars . the majority ( 75@xmath14 ) are contact w - uma - type systems , with apparent blue stragglers , binary main - sequence members and foreground variables identified from their locations on the cluster cmd ( see fig.[linecmd ] ) . a further sample lie on the cluster red giant branch ( rgb ) , indicating that if they are cluster members they likely contain at least one evolved component .",
    "fig.[radhist ] presents the radial distribution of ecb , measured as the distance in arcminutes from the position of the core of the cluster .",
    "the light grey shaded histogram represents the radial distribution of the contact and semi - contact ecb ( with periods @xmath151 day ) , while the dark shaded histogram denotes the detached binaries .",
    "it can be seen that there is a marginal difference in the distribution of these two different types of binary systems ; the results of a ks - test show that there is a 63@xmath14 probability that they have the same distribution .",
    "in contrast , 47 tucanae shows a clear segregation with contact binaries being preferentially located towards the cluster core with high significance @xcite .",
    "also overplotted is the normalised total stellar distribution of the cluster ( open histogram ) and the theoretical king profile @xcite , as derived using the cluster parameters taken from @xcite .",
    "the total stellar distribution is seen to have a 100@xmath14 completeness limit from 10@xmath1 radius outwards .",
    "the binary radial distribution shows an apparent gap in the population in the range 8@xmath1@xmath3315@xmath1 from the cluster core .",
    "other variable star types do not show this gap in their distributions , and so the effect is not thought to be attributed to variable star recoverability limits . from analysis via a ks test , there is only a 10@xmath14 chance that the binaries are distributed in the same way as the other types of variable identified .",
    "this may be evidence for two populations of binary systems in the cluster and can not be attributed to systematic dataset completeness limits . by compensating for the gaps in the time - series spatial coverage caused by telescope offsets during the observing run ( hence regions where no time - series were produced ) ,",
    "this binary distribution is enhanced rather than diminished .",
    "this gap in binaries can not be attributed to mass segregation as the cluster does not show any evidence of this @xcite .",
    "it is possible that this distribution is related to the early life of the cluster as the nucleus of a dwarf galaxy @xcite , which produced a base level of primordial binaries from gas - feeding , which we see as the outer population .",
    "subsequent globular cluster processes ( tidal and 3-body ) would account for the increase in binarity towards the core . as the cluster relaxation time increases with radial distance due to longer",
    "interaction timescales , it is possible that the outer population is composed of the original primordial binaries ( k.c.freeman , private communication ) .",
    "the gap in the ecb distribution could indicate the boundary between these two effects , but it remains unclear with current data .",
    "a number of binaries display interesting features in their lightcurves .",
    "two systems have magnitudes and colors that place them on the cluster horizontal branch instability strip ( hence in the same location as the rr lyrae stars ) : v3 and v166 .",
    "these could be systems that contain one pulsating component orbited by a secondary star ( if members ) , or alternatively ( perhaps more likely ) they could be composed of one heavily distorted component with a small high - mass companion of foreground galactic halo membership .",
    "the first system , v3 , has a short orbital period of 0.81 days and displays continuous sinusoidal variability with an eclipse of @xmath100.04 magnitudes depth .",
    "the eclipsing companion is strongly distorting the primary star .",
    "there seem to be two separate sequences of sinusoidal variability with the same period as the binary companion and an indication of an extended region of eclipse immediately before and after the main eclipse , perhaps indicating the presence of an accretion disk .",
    "the second system of this same type , v166 , is similar , displaying the same strong continuous sinusoidal variability with an eclipse ( of @xmath100.16 magnitude depth ) , but with a longer orbital period of 2.06 days and much higher amplitude of variability .",
    "this star also shows the same two sequences of sinusoid , one sharp - edged and another more rounded with the same period as the binary companion .",
    "both systems are worthy of future spectroscopic follow - up to determine their true nature .",
    "a further binary system of note , v39 , displays a single eclipse in the dataset with a total eclipse duration of @xmath103 days .",
    "our data do not allow conclusions on the central shape of the eclipse .",
    "the color and magnitude of this system is consistent with a cluster member located high on the red giant branch , hence composed of at least one evolved giant star , consistent with an eclipse of long duration .",
    "the derived period of this binary system , 34.8 days , has been determined by the appearance of secondary variations caused by tidal distortion of the primary star ( even though only one eclipse was seen ) .",
    "the location of any secondary eclipse has been given away by the small - scale drop in brightness seen on these secondary variations .",
    "in this same way , other single eclipsers in the dataset have had their likely periods determined ( ie , v71 and v161 ) .",
    "these secondary - determined periods are denoted in table2 with a @xmath34 , and the sinusoidal variability for these stars can be seen in their lightcurves in figs.[varplot1]@xmath9[varplot8 ] .      of the contact eclipsing binary sample , seven systems have orbital periods @xmath150.25 days ; v8 , v10 , v30 , v68 , v73 , v80 , and v124 . due to these very short periods",
    ", it is expected that these systems are composed of low - mass components , very likely late k to m dwarf stars .",
    "all of these systems have magnitudes and colors that overlay on the @xmath0 cen binary main sequence , and hence most are likely members of @xmath0 cen itself . of this sample ,",
    "v8 , v10 , v30 and v80 have v magnitudes in the range 19@xmath3321 .",
    "the other stars are located approximately at the cluster turnoff .",
    "three detached binaries have orbital periods @xmath151.6 days ( v90 , v102 and v153 ) , with a further system with p@xmath182.46d ( v41 ) .",
    "these have been classified as detached systems due to the lack of observable secondary variations caused by the tidal distortion of the components occuring outside of the main eclipses and by the differing eclipse depths observed .",
    "these systems must be composed of low - mass components ( perhaps both in the m - dwarf regime ) for them to display such short periods without the effects of tidal distortion on the lightcurves .",
    "the identification ( and confirmation ) of m - dwarf detached binaries is of great importance in the production of stellar evolutionary models since they allow determination of masses and radii towards the low end of the mass function for comparison to theoretical predictions .    of particular interest",
    "is v153 , a detached binary with an orbital period of 0.83 days .",
    "the color and magnitude of this star place",
    "it blueward of the blue - straggler branch of the cmd , and hence in an unusual place for a detached binary member of the cluster ( which should lie on one of the main cmd sequences ) .",
    "in fact , the v - i value of 0.19 is unusually blue for a detached binary of such short period , which would ordinarily be composed of red components . from our observations of the period and color , considering",
    "the distinct observed eclipses ( with somewhat flat bottoms ) and lack of any observable tidal distortion , we conclude that this binary is very likely a foreground system , with an uncertain composition , perhaps containing a pair of white dwarf stars .",
    "such a system would be a prime candidate for future spectroscopic observations to determine its true nature .",
    "a total of 69 rr lyrae stars were identified in the dataset , the vast majority of which are likely members of the cluster , due to their firm location on the cluster horizontal branch . of the total sample ,",
    "59@xmath14 are examples of rr lyrae type ` ab ' ( fundamental mode pulsators ) and 41@xmath14 are examples of the shorter period rr lyrae type ` c ' ( first harmonic mode pulsators ) based on the shape of their phase - wrapped lightcurves and periods .",
    "type ` c ' stars are typically less common than type ` ab ' @xcite .",
    "none of the rare longer period rr lyrae ahb1 stars @xcite were seen in our data .",
    "twenty - six of our rr lyrae are new discoveries .",
    "fig.[rrlyrplots ] shows the period distribution ( left panel ) and the period - luminosity diagram ( right panel ) for our rr lyrae sample . the period distribution displays two distinct populations , one peaking at pulsation period @xmath100.35 days and the other at period @xmath100.65 days .",
    "these constitute the rr lyrae type ` c ' and type ` ab ' , respectively .",
    "fig.[rrlyramps ] shows the period versus v+r amplitude plot for our sample of rr lyrae stars .",
    "the period - luminosity diagram shows that the majority of rr lyrae ( of both types ) are clustered around v@xmath1014.5 and are hence likely @xmath0 cen members .",
    "a small number of the sample are significantly fainter , running from v@xmath1015.0@xmath3319.5 .",
    "the outliers are attributed to background contamination by the galactic halo .",
    "our photometry becomes saturated at v@xmath1014.0 ( as seen in fig.[rmsplot ] ) and hence there are no foreground rr lyrae detected in the dataset with brighter v magnitudes than this .",
    "to determine memberships based on the magnitude distribution , an application of kmm mixture modelling @xcite was applied , which assumes gaussian distributions with differing dispersions .",
    "as a first check , the faintest six rr lyrae were removed using 3-sigma clipping , producing a mean v magnitude of 14.50@xmath60.33 for the remaining 63 stars . in comparison ,",
    "kmm modelling was applied to the total sample with two gaussians , which produced two samples , one with the 62 brightest rr lyrae and another with the remaining 7 fainter stars .",
    "the result is that everything brighter than and including v@xmath1815.245 ( 62 stars ) is considered a cluster member based on its brightness .",
    "the mean of these 62 ( for both ab and c type rr lyrae ) is 14.51@xmath60.04 , with the error being the standard deviation of the mean , seen overplotted in the right panel of fig.[rrlyrplots ] .    from our total rr lyrae sample ,",
    "it is possible to calculate the distance modulus of the cluster .",

    "@xcite have adopted a relation of the form @xmath35@xmath180.20@xmath60.09[fe / h]@xmath360.81@xmath60.13 , which is also used in this work .",

    "fig.[rrlyrmets ] shows the [ fe / h ] distribution for the 53 of our rr lyrae sample , which were crossidentified with these @xcite metallicity estimates .",
    "two gaussians were fitted via least squares to describe this distribution .",

    "the dispersions of these two gaussians are measured as 0.20 and 0.07 dex respectively , being composed of the natural dispersion of the sample and the uncertainty in the [ fe / h ] measurements as presented by @xcite .",
    "we assume that the remaining 16 rr lyrae in our sample with unknown [ fe / h ] follow these same relative distributions .",
    "the absolute magnitude ( m ) of the most metal poor population is 0.47@xmath60.28 as determined via the @xcite relationship , with m@xmath180.56@xmath60.24 for the second more metal rich group . by considering the relative fractions of the sample in each population ,",
    "the weighted mean absolute magnitude estimated for our total rr lyrae sample is 0.48@xmath60.27 .",
    "the mean v apparent magnitude for the cluster rr lyrae sample ( of all metallicities ) is 14.51@xmath60.04 with the error being the standard deviation of the mean .",
    "this leads to an apparent distance modulus of 14.04@xmath60.27 ( 6.4@xmath60.7kpc ) .",
    "this compares well to the @xcite value of 13.97 and the @xcite estimate of 14.09@xmath60.04 as derived from an eclipsing binary star .",
    "our apparent value is around 0.3 magnitudes brighter than that of @xcite , who find a best - fit dynamical distance modulus of 13.75@xmath60.13 .",
    "the cluster has a non - zero reddening , and if we apply the e(b - v)@xmath180.12 value of @xcite , we arrive at a reddening - corrected distance modulus of 13.68@xmath60.27 ( 5.4@xmath60.7kpc ) .",

    "a small number of the rr lyrae appear to display small - scale secondary variations in the general shape of the lightcurve and are examples of blahzko rr lyrae @xcite .",
    "examples of this effect are seen in v48 , v105 , v110 , v111 , v128 , v136 , v173 and v183 .",
    "quite significant variations are seen particularly in v111 , v128 and v183 .",
    "such variations are a little understood feature of some rr lyrae , and are generally thought to be caused by strong photospheric magnetic fields @xcite and/or rotation @xcite .",
    "the effect is dependent on the metallicity of the star @xcite and is found preferentially in association with type ` ab ' rr lyrae .",
    "we note , however , that v183 can not be easily phase - wrapped and seems to be undergoing a period change . due to their sinusoidal lightcurves ,",
    "their faintness compared to the cluster hb and small amplitude , it is possible that v53 , v99 and v155 are eclipsing binary stars , and are classified as either rr lyrae or ecb in table.1 . as only a small fraction of the lightcurve for v146 was observed , the derived period in table1 is uncertain , but due to it s location on the cluster cmd it has been classified here as an rr lyrae .",

    ", an lpv is defined as having a pulsation - like lightcurve with a periodicity @xmath42 days .",

    "the length of our observing window ( 25 nights ) and saturation limit precludes the detection of variable stars with excessively long pulsation periods ( @xmath10years ) , which would exist in the bright agb region of the cluster population . despite this ,",
    "a rich sample of lpvs with relatively short pulsation periods have been detected in the dataset .    from their locations in fig.[linecmd ] , approximately 75@xmath14 of the detected lpvs are expected to be members of the cluster . a small number ( @xmath106 ) seem to lie on the cluster main sequence .",
