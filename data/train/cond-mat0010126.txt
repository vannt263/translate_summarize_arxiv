    "we assume periodic boundary conditions with the number of atoms @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the number of wells of the periodic potential , so we have one multiple @xmath10-kink ( @xmath10 excessive atoms ) inserted into the commensurate structure .",
    "similarly to the toda model @xcite , one may add also an attractive linear interaction , so that the interaction reduces to the harmonic one in the limit @xmath11 ( the classical fk model ) and to the hard ",

    "the systematic procedure to derive the equation of motion in the continuum limit starting from the discrete lattice was proposed by rosenau @xcite . for the anharmonic fk model ( [ mot ] ) it leads , in the first order of the discreteness parameter , to the equation @xmath19 = 0 ,   \\label{h18 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the width of the static kink , @xmath21 is the elastic constant defined as @xmath22 the anharmonicity parameter @xmath23 is defined as @xmath24 and the parameter @xmath25 describes the discreteness effects . looking for a traveling  wave solution of eq .",
    "( [ h18 ] ) in the form @xmath26 , we obtain the equation @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the sound speed ( in our system of units @xmath29 ) .",

    "[ fig01]a ) , eq .",
    "( [ r2 ] ) allows to find kink s asymptotic rigorously , because the radiation has to decay due to nonzero damping coefficient @xmath6 in the model under consideration . at @xmath30 , substituting @xmath31 into eq .",
    "( [ r2 ] ) , we obtain for the kink width @xmath32 the equation @xmath33 where @xmath34 . similarly , we can find the tail asymptotic behind the kink , @xmath35 at @xmath36 ; the width @xmath37 has to satisfy the same equation ( [ r3 ] ) but with @xmath38 .",
    "one can see that at low velocities , @xmath39 , the discreteness effects lead to a decrease of the kink width in agreement with theory @xcite .",

    "( [ r3 ] ) has a solution for _ any _ kink velocity @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the discreteness effects remove the restriction @xmath40 of sg - type equations . now even for the classical fk model with harmonic interaction the kink may move with any velocity @xmath0 .",
    "a kink solution corresponds to a separatrix of the continuum limit equation . to find the separatrix of eq .",

    "however , due to periodicity of the substrate potential the function @xmath55 must correspond to the separatrix solution as well .",
    "thus , on the ( @xmath56 ) plane the separatrices of the multiple ( @xmath57 ) kinks must intersect at some point with @xmath58 .",
    "one can show that in the model without the discreteness effects , @xmath59 , when the phase space of eq .",

    "( [ r4 ] ) is four - dimensional , thus the separatrices corresponded to multiple kinks may not intersect , and multiple kinks are allowed in principle @xcite .",
    "thus , _ the discrete model formally allows both supersonic and multiple topological excitations . _",
    "although we can not find the separatrix solution analytically , the ordinary differential equation ( [ r4 ] ) can be solved numerically with any desired accuracy .",
    "thus , if one could find a separatrix solution corresponded to supersonic or multiple kink , this will prove their existence .",
    "indeed , looking for a separatrix solution numerically for the @xmath61 and @xmath62 case , we found that at small discreteness , @xmath63 , so that @xmath64 and @xmath65 , the separatrix solution corresponds to the @xmath66-kink at forces as large as @xmath67 , when the kink is supersonic , @xmath68 . on the other hand , for higher discreteness , @xmath69 so that @xmath70 , we saw the @xmath71-kink at @xmath72 when @xmath73 , and the @xmath74-kink at @xmath75 when @xmath76 .",

    "thus , the separatrix solution of eq .",
    "( [ r4 ] ) is _ unique _ , i.e. , for a given set of system parameters _ the model has either the single - kink solution or the double - kink one _ , but never both solutions simultaneously .",
    "thus , we have demonstrated the existence of supersonic and multiple kinks in the driven discrete fk model with anharmonic interaction ( note that the discreteness of the model and the anharmonicity of the interaction are the necessary conditions ) .",
    "but to find the parameter range for their existence ( the sufficient conditions ) , we have to study numerically either the continuum - limit equation ( [ r4 ] ) or , better , the original discrete model ( [ mot ] ) .",
    "the approximate variational approach described below , essentially simplifies this task .",
    "it is easy to show that in the case of @xmath88 , eq .

    "[ fig02 ] together with the dependence @xmath105 obtained by solution of the discrete equation of motion ( [ mot ] ) .",
    "one can see that in the anharmonic model we always have @xmath106 at @xmath107 , and although the simulation velocity is lower than @xmath108 due to additional damping of the moving kink because of phonon radiation , the discrete kink still may reach a supersonic velocity .",
    "thus , the variational approach predicts that the supersonic kinks may be expected in the _ anharmonic _ fk model only .",
    "returning back to the _ discrete _ model , note that in the classical fk model the driven kink can not reach even the sound velocity , because it exists some critical kink velocity @xmath109 above which the driven kink becomes unstable and the system goes to the `` running '' state , where all atoms move with the velocity @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "however , in the anharmonic fk model , the critical kink velocity may exceed the sound speed as has been observed already in the simulation @xcite .",
    "the dependence of @xmath111 on the anharmonicity parameter @xmath112 is shown as inset in fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] . in this calculation",
    "we used the following algorithm @xcite : for a fixed value of @xmath2 ( we took @xmath113 ) , the friction was decreased starting from the overdamped case @xmath114 to the underdamped value @xmath115 in 256 steps . at each step of @xmath6 decreasing we waited untill the steady state was reached and then checked if the transition to the running state took place .",
    "to study multiple kinks with the help of a variational approach , let us consider the double kink as a sum of two single kinks separated by a distance @xmath116 , @xmath117 substituting the ansatz ( [ dk1 ] ) into the functional ( [ fz2 ] ) , we obtain the effective energy @xmath118 which is now a function of two parameters @xmath119 and @xmath116 . looking for a minimum of @xmath118 over @xmath119 at @xmath116 fixed",
    ", we found that for the classical fk model , @xmath96 , the function @xmath120 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath116 , i.e. , the kinks are repelled from one another . on the other hand , for the anharmonic fk model the function",
    "@xmath121 has a minimum at some @xmath122 , so two kinks attract one another and thus have to couple into a double kink .",
    "the `` dissociation '' energy of the double kink is very small at subsonic velocities , but becomes high enough at supersonic velocities ( see inset in fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] ) . the `` size '' @xmath123 of the double kink decreases with @xmath124 increasing .",
    "thus , although the variational approach with the sg - type ansatz is too crude , it nevertheless predicts that the multiple kinks could be stable for high ( supersonic ) kink velocities .",
    "=    as is well known , the sg kinks of the same topological charge always repel from one another .",
    "the same is true for static ( @xmath125 ) kinks of the discrete fk model , including the anharmonic ( @xmath126 ) model @xcite ( contrary to the variational approximation which mistakenly predicted a weak attraction at @xmath40 ) .",
    "thus , it must exist a threshold kink velocity @xmath127 such that at small velocities @xmath128 the steady - state solution of the model corresponds to the @xmath71-kink , while at high velocities @xmath129 , it corresponds to the double ( @xmath74- ) kink ( if @xmath130 is lower than the kink velocity at @xmath18 , that is true at low enough values of @xmath6 ) .",
    "indeed , the simulation results presented in fig .  [ fig03 ] demonstrate that the double kink is stable within the force interval @xmath131 but becomes unstable at higher as well as smaller forces , while the @xmath71-kink is stable for @xmath132 only .",
    "similarly one could expect the existence of a second threshold velocity @xmath133 such that at @xmath134 the steady - state solution will correspond to the @xmath135-kink , _ etc . _",
    "thus , we have shown that supersonic kinks as well as multiple kinks do exist in the driven discrete fk model , if the interatomic interaction is anharmonic . note that both supersonic kinks and multiple kinks remain stable at nonzero system temperatures as well , at least for the time scale of our numerical simulation .",
    "notice also that at high forces the kink velocity is close to that of the toda soliton @xcite .",
    "indeed , the toda soliton is characterized by the `` jump '' @xmath136 , where @xmath137 is the parameter coupled with the soliton velocity @xmath0 by the relationship @xmath138 . in the presence of the external substrate potential due to boundary conditions the jump @xmath139 must be equal to @xmath140 for the @xmath10-kink ; thus we obtain @xmath141 , or @xmath142 . in particular , for the anharmonicity parameter @xmath143 used in the simulation , we have @xmath144 for the @xmath71-kink and @xmath145 for the @xmath74-kink correspondingly .",
    "thus , the supersonic and multiple kinks may be treated as toda solitons `` disturbed '' by the external periodic potential .",
