    "dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsph ) dominate the overall galaxy population in the universe at the low mass end . with most dwarf spheroidals residing in groups and clusters of galaxies , environmental effects are thought to play an important role in the formation and evolution of the dsph galaxy population .",
    "studying the properties of the interstellar medium in dwarf spheroidal galaxies , in combination with their star formation histories , can give us clues to their formation processes ( e.g. , ) and the role of environmental processes in their evolution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "being the most prominent dsph residents of the local group , the three dwarf satellites of andromeda , ngc147 , ngc185 and ngc205 , offer the best opportunity to study the interstellar medium of dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the nearby universe .    in @xcite , we focused on the dust reservoirs in the three dsph satellites of andromeda and show that the observed dust masses in ngc185 and ngc205 are significantly higher compared to the estimated metal enrichment from evolved stars and supernova remnants .",
    "although uncertainties on the dust yields from asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and supernovae might affect the estimated dust production rates , the observed dust masses exceed predictions by an order of magnitude and can only be explained by efficient interstellar grain growth or longer dust survival times ( 3 - 6gyr ) .",
    "based on observational constraints of the evolved stellar populations , the dsph satellites ngc147 , ngc185 and ngc205 are shown to be characterised by significantly lower gas masses compared to the predicted material returned by evolved stars and the left - over gas reservoir that remains after previous star - formation episodes @xcite . the gas deficiency in ngc205 was attributed to environmental interactions with parent galaxy andromeda and/or efficient stellar feedback @xcite . to rule out that an important gaseous ism reservoir has been overlooked in previous studies , we require an accurate quantification of the interstellar material ( its mass and properties ) in dsphs in combination with models that account for the gas mass returned by the evolved stellar population and supernovae . in this paper , we make a revised inventory and updated analysis of the gaseous reservoir in the three dsph satellite galaxies of andromeda by taking into account all significant phases of their ism",
