    "the dilute lattice models @xcite are exactly solvable @xcite restricted solid - on - solid ( rsos ) models on the square lattice .",
    "these models resemble the lattice models of pasquier @xcite in that the spins or heights take their values on a dynkin diagram of a classical lie algebra .",
    "the properties of these two families of models , however , are quite distinct and recent studies have shown that the dilute models exhibit some new and very interesting aspects .    first and foremost , in contrast to the @xmath0 model of andrews , baxter and forrester @xcite , the dilute @xmath0 models , with @xmath7 odd , can be solved @xcite off - criticality in the presence of a symmetry - breaking field . in particular , in an appropriate regime , the dilute @xmath36 model lies in the universality class of the ising model in a magnetic field and gives the magnetic exponent @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "in addition , zamolodchikov @xcite has argued that the magnetic ising model in the scaling region is described by an @xmath38 scattering theory .",
    "accordingly , related @xmath38 structures have recently been uncovered @xcite in the dilute @xmath36 model .",
    "lastly , the dilute lattice models give @xcite lattice realizations of the complete unitary minimal series of conformal field theories @xcite .",
    "this again is not the case for the models of pasquier .",
    "an important step in the study of the @xmath0 models of andrews , baxter and forrester ( abf ) was the fusion @xcite of the elementary weights to form new solutions of the yang - baxter equations .",
    "subsequently , it was shown @xcite that the transfer matrices of the fused abf models satisfy special functional relations which can be solved for the eigenvalue spectra of these models . moreover , at criticality , these equations can be solved for the central charges @xcite and conformal weights @xcite .    following the developments for the @xmath0 models of andrews , baxter and forrester , we carry out in this paper the fusion procedure for the dilute @xmath0 lattice models and derive a fusion hierarchy of functional relations satisfied by the fused transfer matrices .",
    "the solution of this fusion hierarchy for the eigenvalue spectra , central charges and conformal weights will be given in a subsequent paper @xcite .",
    "historically , the fusion procedure was first introduced in @xcite .",
    "it has since been successfully applied @xcite to many solvable models in two - dimensional statistical mechanics .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in section  1.1",
    "we define the dilute lattice models . in section  1.2",
    "we present the bethe ansatz for the commuting transfer matrices .",
    "then in section  1.3 we discuss the fusion hierarchy and its connection to the bethe ansatz . in section",
    "2 we construct the fused face weights for elementary fusion . in section",
    "3 we give in detail the procedure for constructing the completely symmetrically , @xmath39 and antisymmetrically @xmath40 fused face weights .",
    "this is generalized in section  4 to construct the fused face weights for arbitrary fusion of mixed type @xmath41 . finally ,",
    "in section  5 , we present the fusion hierarchy of functional relations and bethe ansatz for the general fusion of mixed type @xmath41 .",

    "furthermore , these equations close at level @xmath74 with t^(n , m)_0 = 0 .",

    "in the following section , we treat the more general case of level @xmath39 and @xmath40 fusion , in both horizontal and vertical directions .",

    "this relation takes the form x^(b , d)(u ) x^(b , d)(-u ) = ( u)(-u ) i. [ blockinvrel ] it follows that the four block matrices bd3 , bd-3 bd2 , bd-2 are singular .",
