    "the gravitational deflection of photons can be used as a probe of the matter distribution along the line of sight to the sources .",
    "the latter may be at the last scattering surface ( @xmath1 ) , in the case of the cosmic microwave background ( seljak 1996 ; martnez - gonzlez et al .",
    "1997 ; bernardeau 1997 ) , or high@xmath2 objects as qsos or galaxies ( blanford et al . 1991 ; kaiser 1992 ; kaiser & squires 1993 ; bartelmann 1995 ; villumsen 1995b ; villumsen 1996 ; bernardeau , van waerbeke & mellier 1996 ; kaiser 1996 ; jain & seljak 1996 ) .",
    "information about the matter fluctuations can be obtained on different scales ranging from galaxy haloes to the large - scale structure of the universe .",
    "many of the theoretical studies on this subject have dealt with the polarization or ellipticity produced on background galaxies by the large - scale structure of the universe , and there are currently several ongoing observational projects trying to detect and quantify this effect .",
    "nevertheless , measuring shear amplitudes as the ones predicted by the above mentioned calculations is very difficult from a technical point of view ( although see mould et al .",
    "1991 ; villumsen 1995a ) , and it is not totally clear if such a precision would be routinely achievable in the near future ( ringberg workshop 1997 ) .    however , there is another observable phenomenon produced by gravitational lensing of background sources by foreground mass distributions which may have been already detected : qso - galaxy associations due to the magnification bias effect @xcite .",
    "the surface density of a sample of flux - limited background sources behind a lens which magnifies them by a factor @xmath3 is changed in the form @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the unperturbed background source density .",
    "if @xmath6 ( or @xmath7 ) , the change in the density can be characterized by the factor @xmath8 .",
    "thus , depending on the slope @xmath9 there may be an excess of background sources ( @xmath10 ) , a depletion ( @xmath11 ) , or the density may remain unchanged ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "if we properly choose the background source population , so that it has a slope @xmath9 considerably different from 1 , there would be a correlation ( or anticorrelation ) between the position of the matter overdensities acting as lenses and the background sources .",
    "now , these matter perturbations will be traced , up to a bias factor , by galaxies and thus , there will be a correlation between these foreground galaxies ( or any other tracers of dark matter ) and the background sources .",
    "there are several reported associations between foreground galaxies and high redshift , background agns ( see schneider , ehlers & falco ( 1992 ) ; narayan & bartelmann ( 1996 ) or wu ( 1996 ) for reviews ) , but only a few of these studies extend to relatively large scales .",
    "bartelmann & schneider ( 1994 ) found a strong association between galaxies selected from the iras faint source catalogue and high@xmath2 agn from the 1jy catalogue . in bentez & martnez- gonzlez ( 1995 )",
    "it was found that red apm galaxies tracing large scale structures were correlated with 1jy qsos .",
    "another sample of radio loud qsos , extracted from the pks catalogue has also been found to be correlated with cosmos galaxies @xcite , with a correlation scale of several arcmin .",
    "other studies considering the correlation between galaxy clusters and high - z qsos ( seitz & schneider 1995 , wu & han 1996 ) have also found positive results .    in this paper , we shall study the effects of weak gravitational lensing by foreground matter fluctuations on a population of background sources at high@xmath2 .",
    "we consider different values of @xmath0 and model the fluctuations assuming cdm with a power spectrum whose evolution in time follows a standard ansatz ( hamilton et al .",
    "1991 , peacock & dodds 1996 , linear and non - linear contributions are considered ) .",
    "we assume that these matter perturbations are traced , up to a global bias parameter @xmath13 by galaxies .",
    "more specifically , we shall explore the behavior of @xmath14 , i.e. the large - scale correlation between the ellipticity of background galaxies and the position of foreground ones , which apparently has not been considered in the literature .",
    "we shall also consider in detail other correlations ( in particular their dependence on @xmath0 ) such as @xmath15 i.e. magnification - foreground galaxies and magnification - magnification .",
    "@xmath16 can be indirectly estimated through the galaxy - galaxy correlation function ( villumsen 1995b ) . however , measuring @xmath17 offers several advantages over @xmath16 from the observational point of view . in the first place",
    ", @xmath17 has an amplitude several times higher than @xmath16 . besides",
    ", if the foreground and background galaxy populations are properly selected so that there is no redshift overlap between them ( e.g high@xmath2 qsos and bright galaxies ) , one does not have to bother about intrinsic correlations : any measured effect should be caused by gravitational lensing .",
    "section 2 develops the formalism dealing with weak gravitational lensing for a flat and open cosmological model , the concepts of magnification and polarization ( or ellipticity ) and the different correlations . in section 3",
    "appear the main theoretical results as well as comments on different observational perspectives .",
    "finally , in section 4 we give the conclusions of the paper .",
    "we will consider the propagation of photons from a source at redshift @xmath18 to the observer ( @xmath19 ) , the universe being a perturbed friedmann model with vanishing pressure . for scalar perturbations ,",
    "the metric in the conformal newtonian gauge is given in terms of the scale factor @xmath20 and a single potential @xmath21 , that satisfies the poisson equation , as follows ( martnez - gonzlez et al .",
    "1997 ) @xmath22,\\ ] ] @xmath23 we take units such that @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote the flat , open and closed friedmann background universe .    assuming a perturbation scheme ( `` weak lensing '' ) , the null geodesic equation for the previous metric can be integrated in the form @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the direction of observation and @xmath28 is the distance to the photon in the background metric , i.e.      the perturbation @xmath30 can be decomposed in a term parallel to the direction of observation @xmath27 and a term , @xmath31 , ortoghonal to such a direction .",
    "the last term is given by    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is a window function    @xmath34    for photons that are propagated from a source at redshift @xmath18 ( distance @xmath35 ) to the observer(@xmath36 or @xmath37 ) , the lensing vector @xmath38 is defined in the usual way : @xmath39 thus we find @xmath40 once we have obtained the expression for the trajectory of the photon in the conformal newtonian gauge , it is easy to calculate everything in the conformal synchronous - comoving gauge ( martnez - gonzlez et al .",
    "the lensing vector in such a gauge ( that is the appropriate one from the point of view of observations ) is given by the expression ( 5 ) plus some additional terms that can be interpreted as doppler contributions at the source and observer and an acceleration term at the observer .",
    "the last two terms can be estimated from the doppler velocity respect to the cosmic microwave background and from our local infall towards the virgo cluster ( or great attractor ) .",
    "these extra contributions are very small , so the lensing vector @xmath38 in the synchronous - comoving gauge is approximately given by @xmath38 , as defined by equations ( 3 , 5 ) .",
    "let us assume a population of background sources ( e.g. quasars or galaxies ) , placed at different distances @xmath35 with a distribution @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "then , we can define the integrated lensing vector @xmath43 and taking into account equations ( 3 - 5 ) we obtain    @xmath44    @xmath45 @xmath46    if we take the derivative along the plane orthogonal to the direction of observation @xmath27 , we get the convergence tensor @xmath47 which can be decomposed in the form    @xmath48    for weak lensing , the convergence scalar @xmath49 is related to the magnification by @xmath50 .",
    "moreover , the polarization components in the plane orthogonal to @xmath27 can be defined in the standard way @xmath51 and the complex polarization is @xmath52 .",
    "so , we can define the scalar polarization @xmath53 .",
    "let us consider a second population of foreground sources ( e.g. galaxies ) placed at different distances @xmath28 with a distribution @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) .",

    "then , we can define the integrated overdensity @xmath59 .",
    "taking into account equations ( 3 - 7 ) , we obtain    @xmath60    @xmath61    where @xmath62 . using the limber approximation ( see appendix ) , i. e. only a small region @xmath63 is contributing with @xmath64 , the previous equation can be approximated by    @xmath65\\times\\nonumber\\\\   & \\times&{\\int}_{\\theta s}^{\\infty}dr \\frac{c_{\\phi \\delta}(\\lambda ; r ) } { { ( r^2 - { \\theta}^2 s^2)}^{1/2}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where now appears the correlation at a single time and @xmath66 is given by @xmath67^{-1}$ ] . introducing the power spectrum @xmath68 of the matter density fluctuations defined by    @xmath69    and the relation @xmath70 , obtained via the poisson equation for small scales , the last expression ( 11 ) is    @xmath71    finally , taking another @xmath72 derivative on the equation ( 9 ) , we get the following correlations    @xmath73    @xmath74    @xmath75    and @xmath76 is the bessel function of 1st kind .",
    "these are the basic formulas to be applied when two different populations are correlated . in particular , the background - foreground correlation function is given by bartelmann ( 1995 ) .    @xmath77    where @xmath78 is the slope of the background source number counts .",

    "moreover , @xmath101 is given by equation ( 14 ) but now @xmath102 must be substituted by @xmath103 .",
    "trivially , for a strongly peaked @xmath18-distribution such a correlation is very small ( see the dependence on @xmath104 in equation ( 19 ) ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the observed correlation function @xmath105 associated to a population is given by the following contributions ( villumsen 1995b )    @xmath106    @xmath107    where @xmath108 is the matter correlation function .",
    "so , gravitational lensing modifies the intrinsic correlation approximately by the magnification term .",
    "with the formalism presented in the previous section we have calculated the correlations @xmath17 , @xmath14 and @xmath16 .",
    "we assume a cdm model with a primordial harrison - zeldovich spectrum , a hubble parameter h@xmath109 ( h@xmath110h km s@xmath111 mpc@xmath111 ) and flat as well as open universe models . for the power spectrum",

    "for the nonlinear evolution of the power spectrum we use the recently improved fitting formula given by peacock and dodds ( 1996 ) .",
    "that formula is based on the hamilton et al .",
    "( 1991 ) scaling procedure to describe the transition between linear and nonlinear regimes .",
    "it accounts for the correction introduced by jain , mo and white ( 1995 ) for spectra with @xmath113 and applies to flat as well as open universes .    for the redshift distributions of the background and foreground sources we consider a dirac delta distribution peaked at @xmath114 and @xmath115 respectively , @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",

    "the crosscorrelation @xmath119 for a population of background sources peaked at @xmath120 and another of foreground lenses at @xmath121 is given in figure ( 1 ) .",
    "the effect is maximum at zero lag and rapidly decreases for scales above a few arcmin .",
    "the amplitude is always above a few percent for scales @xmath122 and at these scales the linear contribution is negligible compared to the nonlinear one for all the @xmath0 values .",
    "notice that @xmath17 increases when @xmath0 decreases whereas considering only the linear contribution the situation is reversed .    from the observational point of view",
    "it is useful to calculate the average crosscorrelation ( or equivalently the mean relative excess of background sources around foreground lenses ) within a given radius @xmath123 , @xmath124 .",
    "the variation of @xmath125 with @xmath126 for different values of @xmath79 and a @xmath127 radius is shown in figures ( 2a , b , c ) .",

    "it is interesting to notice that there are already available large galaxy samples , like the apm or cosmos catalogues , which peak at a redshift within that range ( for the apm catalogue @xmath130 for a magnitude limit @xmath131 , see efstathiou 1995 ) .",
    "moreover , the use of realistic redshift distributions to represent the foreground and background populations ( with a bell - like shape similar to that of the apm one ) , changes the results in only @xmath132 for the relevant angular scales compared to the dirac delta distribution used here . those catalogues , which except for a bias factor are assumed to follow the large scale matter distribution , are therefore very suitable to crosscorrelate with a background source population . this has already been done by bentez and martnez - gonzlez ( 1995 , 1997 ) for the 1 jansky and parkes samples of radio loud qsos as background populations , finding clear evidences of positive crosscorrelations . in figure 3 , we show @xmath119 for @xmath133 and for @xmath134 and @xmath120 , mean redshift values appropriate for the galaxy and radio qso samples considered above .",

    "this is done in figure ( 7 ) for @xmath120 .",
    "the maximum effect is at zero lag and its amplitude is relatively small @xmath150 .",
    "the nonlinear contribution clearly dominates over the linear one but now the amplitude grows with @xmath0 , contrary to the crosscorrelations @xmath119 and @xmath135 .",
    "our results are in agreement with jain & seljak ( 1996 ) , and with kaiser ( 1997 ) for one degree scales ( see also those papers for a more detailed analysis of @xmath16 ) , where the dominant contribution is the linear one .",
    "considering also the slope of the population of sources following equation ( 26 ) , @xmath16 could be estimated from the observed autocorrelation of faint galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , measuring @xmath91 should be more feasible from the practical point of view , as we do not have to disentangle the contribution caused by lensing from the intrinsic correlations ; it is usually assumed ( and strongly hoped ) that the intrinsic ellipticities of background galaxies are not correlated .",
