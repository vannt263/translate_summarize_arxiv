    "@xcite and a.  mcneil  @xcite for various simulation algorithms ) .",
    "secondly , the parameters of the most prominent copulas such as the t - copulas , archimedean copulas ( for instance clayton and gumbel ) or nested archimedean copulas are related to pairwise dependencies of the marginal distributions so that a copula in the corresponding family is uniquely determined by the projections onto the @xmath0-dimensional faces .    in this paper",
    "we give a general construction principle , which we call _ tail nesting _ , for copulas in any dimension  @xmath1 .",
    "the characteristics of the tails can be shaped by prescribing the tail dependencies in a very flexible manner .",
