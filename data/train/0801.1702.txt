    "string models with tension in the tev region @xcite are an exciting possibility for physics beyond the standard model ( for a review , see refs .",
    "this scenario was made concrete by the modern understanding of open strings and orientifold compactifications @xcite , and by many important subsequent developments ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this framework ,",
    "the higgs doublet responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking is typically identified with some massless open - string mode on d@xmath2-branes , that can acquire a negative mass squared via radiative corrections in models without supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking is essentially determined by the string tension ( and/or by the radii of the compact space ) , and this scenario can be a natural dynamical setting where string effects play a direct role for particle physics .    in string models with broken supersymmetry , however , there is in general a vexing difficulty , the so called ns - ns tadpole problem .",
    "the existence of tadpoles in the ns - ns closed - string sector signals that the assumed background metric and field configuration ( typically flat spacetime with vanishing background fields ) _ is not _ a solution of string theory . on the other hand ,",
    "it is quite difficult to construct string models with more general background metrics or non - trivial fields , so that a prescription to cure this problem proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite is also not easy to implement .",
    "the actual difficulty manifests itself via the emergence of infrared divergences in loop calculations of open string amplitudes .",
    "tadpole resummation as a possible way to overcome this problem was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where several examples of field theories defined in  wrong \" vacua were discussed . indeed , barring convergence issues and other subtleties ,",
    "the correct value of the vacuum energy can generically be recovered by the procedure of tadpole resummation .",
    "this procedure is nonetheless quite complicated , since it requires that one add up all tree - level diagrams involving tadpole contributions .    in this letter",
    "we propose a concrete method to implement this procedure in string theory , showing that tadpole resummations actually lead to the correct answer for open - string tachyon condensation . to this end , we combine the boundary state formalism with some information drawn from the low - energy dynamics of branes . in the next section",
    "the boundary state formalism for d - branes and o - planes is thus briefly reviewed . in section [ resum_dp ]",
    "we study the vacuum energies ( tensions ) of d@xmath0-branes for the bosonic string - branes do not carry rr charges , but are nonetheless characterized as being locations of the endpoints of open strings . ] in flat @xmath3-dimensional spacetime as a first simple example .",
    "these d@xmath0-branes have generally tadpoles for dilaton , graviton and tachyon modes .",
    "the conjecture of open string tachyon condensation @xcite claims that they should decay to the vacuum , so that the actual vacuum energy should vanish .",
    "this conjecture has received strong support from string field theory @xcite , although the resulting mechanism appears rather complicated and rests crucially on the contributions of open string massive modes . here",
    "we show that , rather remarkably , the phenomenon can be understood in somewhat simpler terms : in the dual closed channel a _ negative _ contribution originating from tree - level tadpole resummations _ exactly cancels _ the positive classical vacuum energy of the d@xmath0-brane .",
    "section [ resum_d25 ] is devoted to a similar analysis of tadpole resummations for the d@xmath4-branes of the so@xmath1 open bosonic string @xcite .",
    "the absence of massless dilaton and graviton tadpoles makes somehow this d@xmath4-brane  o@xmath4-plane system a solution of string theory , albeit an unstable one .",
    "we show that , indeed , in this case tree - level tadpole resummations do not produce any correction to the d@xmath4-brane tension , despite the presence of a tadpole for the tachyon .",
    "the last section is devoted to a brief discussion of the limitations of the method ( originating from the actual neglect of the gravitational back reaction ) and of its application to superstring models with broken supersymmetry .",
    "in superstrings , d - branes can be conveniently described by boundary states for the closed string in the world - sheet theory ( for a review , see ref .",
    "the technique also applies for the d - branes of the bosonic string , that despite the lack of a rr charge , bear strong similarities to their supersymmetric counterparts . for the @xmath3-dimensional bosonic string in flat spacetime , a d@xmath0-brane boundary state at the origin , @xmath5 , satisfies the conditions @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a closed - string coordinate .",
    "the boundary state can be explicitly expressed as a coherent state built from the string oscillators , @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , the spacetime signature is `` mostly plus '' , and @xmath12 @xmath13 the @xmath14-ghost contribution is determined so that the full boundary state is brst invariant , while the normalization constant @xmath15 for one d@xmath0-brane is @xmath16 with @xmath17 and the @xmath3-dimensional planck constant @xmath18 , so that the single dilaton and graviton tadpole couplings in the einstein frame are reproduced @xcite . for a collection of @xmath19 coincident d@xmath0-branes",
    "the normalization factor should be multiplied by @xmath19 .",
    "the amplitudes for single dilaton or graviton emission are @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the d@xmath0-brane world volume and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are projection and polarization tensors for the dilaton and the graviton , respectively .",
    "these amplitudes are also determined by the effective action for a d@xmath0-brane in the einstein frame , @xmath25 where we are ignoring both the @xmath26-field and the gauge field on the d@xmath0-brane , for simplicity . with this normalization factor ,",
    "the open string one - loop vacuum amplitudes on d@xmath0-branes are simply obtained as @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the closed string propagator operator , with @xmath30 .",
    "the factor @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ cylinder ] ) reflects the fact that the amplitude is of second order in the tadpole insertion .",

    ", the crosscap state should satisfy the condition @xmath32 the explicit form of the crosscap state is @xmath33 @xmath34 the normalization constant @xmath35 is determined as @xmath36 in the same way as @xmath15 .",

    "( [ klein ] ) and ( [ moebius ] ) , one can see that @xmath40 d@xmath4-branes , with the normalization factor @xmath41 for d@xmath4-brane boundary state , are necessary and sufficient to cancel tadpoles in the unoriented bosonic closed string theory @xcite .",
    "at the classical level , the vacuum energy density on a d@xmath0-brane coincides with its tension , @xmath42 , and can be read from eq .",
    "( [ dbi ] ) .",
    "the open string one - loop correction to the vacuum energy is given by eq .",
    "( [ cylinder ] ) , and contains divergences due to the tadpoles of dilaton , graviton and tachyon in @xmath43 .",
    "these tadpole contributions can be exhibited expanding the integrand of @xmath43 for large value of @xmath44 , as @xmath45 the first term within brackets is the contribution of tachyon tadpoles while the second is the overall contribution from massless dilaton and graviton tadpoles .",
    "these divergences can in principle be regularized via an `` infrared '' cutoff on @xmath44 ( or `` ultraviolet '' , from the open - channel perspective ) , and we shall do it implicitly in what follows .",
    "it is important to recognize that , in addition to the cylinder amplitude , the simplest contribution in the closed - string picture , there are many other three - level contributions with closed string contact interactions , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : propagator ] and [ fig : multipoint ] .",
    "there are also closed - string one - loop and higher - loop contributions , that we neglect in the present calculations .",
    "as we stressed above , the existence of the contact interactions between dilaton / graviton and d - branes can be simply inferred from effective action of eq .",
    "( [ dbi ] ) .",
    "the effect of the two point contact interaction , that can be understood as a process in which a closed string bounces off the d - brane at the origin , can be accounted for inserting the operator @xmath46 where @xmath47 @xmath48 the state @xmath49 is essentially a d@xmath0-brane boundary state with a different normalization , with the position of the closed string on the d@xmath0-brane fixed at the generic point @xmath50 , and indeed the integration in the definition of @xmath51 is over the d@xmath0-brane world volume .",
    "the overall normalization of the operator @xmath51 is such that the coupling constant of the dilaton two - point contact interaction coincides with that present in the effective field theory of eq .",

    "[ fig : propagator ] is thus @xmath52 the quantity @xmath53 can be calculated in the same way as the cylinder amplitude : @xmath54 therefore , @xmath55 the `` two - bounce '' , `` three - bounce '' and all the other amplitudes of this type can then be computed in the same way .",
    "the complete `` two - point function '' is then obtained summing all these contributions as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : propagator ] .",
    "@xmath56 the result is a geometric series involving the regularized @xmath43 .",

    "[ fig : multipoint ] .",
    "there is a dilaton three - point contact interaction with the d@xmath0-brane , that again can be deduced from eq .",
    "( [ dbi ] ) . in the boundary state formalism",
    "this interaction could be represented via an operator acting on three states : @xmath59 the legs of the resulting `` three - point function '' should be _ full _ `` two - point functions '' , namely , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a symmetry factor . , the third order of the tadpole insertion brings about one more @xmath61 , while the number of contractions gives rise to a factor @xmath62 . ]",
    "a straightforward calculation gives @xmath63 and therefore @xmath64 the contribution to the vacuum energy density on a d@xmath0-brane is thus @xmath65 one can continue this calculation along similar lines for the `` four - point function '' , and in fact to all orders .",
    "the end result is very similar to the example of the scalar field with exponential potential of ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath66 since the series can be easily shown to add up to one . therefore , the total contribution to the vacuum energy density on a d@xmath0-brane arising from the tree - level tadpole resummation is simply @xmath67 and exactly cancels the classical energy density @xmath68 .",
    "the tree - level tadpole resummation of the previous section is essentially governed by the fact that the open string one - loop vacuum amplitude , @xmath43 , contains a divergent massless contribution .",
    "it is therefore interesting to verify that the contribution vanishes in the absence of massless tadpoles , even if a tachyon tadpole is present . in this section",
    "we thus examine the tadpole resummation in the so@xmath1 theory , where massless tadpoles are canceled as a result of the cooperative action of the d@xmath4-branes and an o@xmath4-plane .",
    "there are three types of open - string one - loop contributions to the vacuum energy , associated to the cylinder , mbius strip and klein bottle amplitudes : @xmath69 the divergences due to the tadpoles emerge from @xmath70 notice that the tachyon contributions have the same sign , while the massless dilaton / graviton contributions have opposite signs , in these two quantities .",
    "one can define two divergent quantities related , respectively , to the tachyon and dilaton / graviton tadpoles , as @xmath71 that can be regulated introducing an `` infrared '' cutoff on @xmath44 .",
    "one can then write @xmath72 in order to obtain the full `` two - point functions '' , `` bounce effects '' on both d@xmath4-branes and the o@xmath4-plane should be included .",
    "the `` bounce effect '' on the o@xmath4-plane can be accounted for inserting the operator @xmath73 that is obtained in the same way as the operator @xmath51 , where @xmath74 and @xmath75 is the tension of o@xmath4-plane",
    ".    the full `` two - point function '' with both edges on d@xmath4-branes and without o@xmath4-bounces was already given in eq .",
    "( [ 2ptfinal ] ) , and is @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 include the number of d@xmath4-branes , @xmath40 . therefore , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the `` two - point function '' with both edges on d@xmath4-branes with one o@xmath4-bounce but without d@xmath4-bounces is @xmath81 there are two contributions to the `` two - point function '' with both edges on d@xmath4-branes with one o@xmath4-bounce and one d@xmath4-bounce : @xmath82 where the overall @xmath83 is a symmetry factor , so that @xmath84 these results can be understood in terms of feynman rules for the `` propagator '' and the `` mass insertion '' .",
    "the `` propagators '' @xmath85 and @xmath86 give @xmath87 , and the `` propagators '' @xmath88 and @xmath89 give @xmath90 .",
    "on the other hand , the `` mass insertions '' determined by @xmath51 and @xmath91 give @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "certain symmetry factors should be included , and there is also an overall factor @xmath94 .",
    "it is then straightforward to compute the `` two - point function '' with both edges on d@xmath4-branes , with one o@xmath4-bounce and full d@xmath4-bounce : @xmath95 the `` two - point functions '' with both edges on d@xmath4-branes with two o@xmath4-bounces and full d@xmath4-bounce are more complicated .",
    "the contribution without d@xmath4-bounces is @xmath96 the next contributions with one d@xmath4 bounce have three different forms : @xmath97 although the first and the third of these coincide , the second is different . taking only the dominant divergence due to the tachyon tadpoles , so that @xmath98 and @xmath99 , the sum of the above three contributions becomes @xmath100 it is then straightforward to calculate the contribution from two or more d@xmath4-bounces , and finally the result with full d@xmath4-bounce becomes @xmath101 it is now straightforward to obtain the contribution with full o@xmath4 and d@xmath4 bounces : @xmath102 recalling that @xmath103 is a divergent quantity , one can thus see that the `` two - point function '' with both edges on the d@xmath4-brane ( cylinder with bounces ) , vanishes .",
    "the other two types of `` two - point functions '' , with both edges on the o@xmath4-plane ( klein bottle with bounces ) and with one with one edge on the d@xmath4-brane and the other on the o@xmath4-plane ( mbius strip with bounces ) , are exactly identical and thus also vanish .",
    "since all `` two - point function '' vanish , the `` three - point functions '' and in fact all higher - point functions vanish , as can be simply understood by the arguments in the previous section . in conclusion , there is no contribution to the vacuum energy resulting from tadpole resummation , despite the presence of the tachyon tadpole .",
    "if we neglect the divergence introduced by tachyon tadpoles ( or if we define it by analytic continuation as @xmath104 ) , letting @xmath105 and @xmath106 , the contribution of the cylinder with bounces equals the contribution of the klein bottle with bounces , while the contribution of cylinder with bounces equals @xmath107 of the contribution of mbius strip with bounces .",
    "this is easily understood , since the replacement of one d@xmath4-brane boundary state to one o@xmath4-place crosscap state gives rise to a sign change , due to @xmath108 .",
    "therefore , again , all contributions to the vacuum energy arising from tadpole resummations add up to a vanishing result , just like the tadpole contributions , in the so@xmath1 theory .",
    "it is interesting that these simple calculations give the result expected by sen s conjecture of open - string tachyon condensation from a closed - channel perspective .",
    "the calculations combine the boundary state formalism with some information drawn from the low - energy effective field theory",
    ". it would be interesting to try and extend this method to closed - string field theory , since there is no proof that this method gives the exact result .",
    "the key problems to be considered are the following .    in open - string tachyon condensation in string field theory ,",
    "the tachyon potential is obtained integrating out the open string massive modes ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "the actual numerical calculation is based on the level truncation approximation , and the obtained numerical value of the vacuum energy is indeed very close to zero . on the other hand ,",
    "the role of the open string massive modes is not evident in our method , where infrared divergences due to closed string tadpoles are important .",
    "it is natural that an infinite number of open string modes are required , since we are making explicit use of open - closed string duality and we are tracking the tadpoles of low - lying closed string states , the dilaton , the graviton and the closed - string tachyon .",
    "we have accounted for the propagation of closed strings in a rigid spacetime perpendicular to the d - branes .",
    "in particular , we have been considering a flat spacetime , which should not be a good approximation in absolute terms , since the very existence of d - branes is known to lead to a back reaction on the space - time geometry .",
    "indeed , it was shown in ref .  @xcite that in string models with broken supersymmetry without tachyons , the dilaton tadpole curves the original flat minkowski background , leading to a sort of spontaneous compactification .",
    "the effect of this gravitational back reaction is clearly not included in our calculation , but is similarly not included in the analyses based on string field theory .",
    "the gravitational back reaction may change the contribution of the tadpole resummation .",
    "other subtleties resulting from the inclusion of gravity in the tadpole resummation in field theory were discussed in ref .",
    "it is not clear whether or not these problems are overcome in our method .    in spite of these problems , it is straightforward to apply this method to superstring models with `` brane supersymmetry breaking ''",
    "i.e. _ broken supersymmetry on branes with no tachyon but dilaton tadpoles .",
    "for instance , in the usp@xmath109 sugimoto model @xcite all `` two - point functions '' can be computed exactly as in so@xmath1 model , and the final result is @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the normalization factor of the boundary state of d@xmath112-brane , @xmath113 is the tension of the d@xmath112-brane and @xmath114 includes only a divergence due to massless dilaton / graviton tadpoles ( since there is no tachyon ) , defined in the same way as @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , all `` two - point functions '' vanish , so that there is no correction to the vacuum energy from tadpole resummation",
    ". it would be interesting to apply this method to the calculation of other physical quantities , and for instance to the masses of scalar fields .",
