    "bremsstrahlung , the emission of a photon by an electron scattering from an atom , is one of the fundamental processes that occur in the electron - atom collisions . for a large region of the impact energies of the incoming electron , the atom can be well represented by a static central ( screening ) potential , thus ignoring the exchange interaction between the incoming electron and the target and virtual excitations of the target .",
    "the corresponding approximation is sometimes referred as the `` ordinary '' bremsstrahlung mechanism , to distinguish from the so - called `` polarization '' bremsstrahlung , in which the excess energy is transferred to the target and the photon is emitted from the atomic core .",
    "the polarization bremsstrahlung is the dominant mechanism in , e.g. , the _",
    "proton_-atom collisions ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , where the ordinary bremsstrahlung is suppressed by the small electron - to - proton mass ratio . in the electron - atom collisions , however , the polarization mechanism is usually not significant for the not - too - small energies of the incoming electron .    within the screening - potential approximation , the bremsstrahlung process can be described rigorously ( to the leading order in the fine - structure constant @xmath0 ) within the exact relativistic approach based on the partial - wave representation of the dirac continuum electron states with a fixed value of the asymptotic momentum .",
    "this approach is clearly preferable as compared to numerous approximate treatments reported in the literature but it is also more difficult for practical implementations . the partial - wave decomposition of the initial and final electron states , together with the multipole expansion of the wave function of the emitted photon , lead to a large number of expansion terms that have to be summed up until convergence is reached . despite technical difficulties encountered ,",
    "the first partial - wave expansion calculations were reported already in 1960s @xcite .",
    "the first accurate numerical results were obtained by tseng and pratt in 1970s . in a series of calculations",
    "@xcite , they reported results for the single- and double - differential cross sections for a wide interval of the impact energies .",
    "polarization correlations in the double - differential cross section were studied in ref .",
    "more recently , several calculations of the triple - differential cross section and the corresponding polarization correlations were performed @xcite .",
    "experimental investigations of the electron - atom bremsstrahlung , numerous in 1960s and 1970s @xcite , became rather sparse during the following decades .",
    "in the last years , however , advent of a new generation of the compton polarimeters @xcite revived the experimental interest to bremsstrahlung .",
    "in particular , it became possible to perform experiments with the spin - polarized electrons , which opens up new vistas for experimental studies of various correlations between the polarizations of the incoming electron and the emitted photon .",
    "such experiments are currently underway in gesellschaft fr schwerionenforschung ( gsi ) @xcite and technical university of darmstadt @xcite .",

    "it is interesting to observe that the bremsstrahlung on the bare nucleus and the neutral atom are very much alike for not - too - small impact energies .",

    "for @xmath147  kev and gold target , the screening reduces the forward - scattering cross section by more than a factor of 2 , whereas at energies of a few mev , it is still a 10% effect . for the stokes parameters , the screening effect is smaller than for the cross section and stays within 10% even at the lowest energy studied , @xmath147  kev .",
    "we observe that for energies below 20  kev and gold target , calculations of the cross section within the screening - potential approximation rapidly become meaningless as the screening effect tends to grow very fast as the energy decreases . on the contrary ,",
    "the stokes parameters turn out to be much less sensitive to the electronic structure of the target .",
    "we also find that for the high energies above 1  mev , the screening effect is significant mainly for the cross section at close - to - zero angles , where it amounts to about 10% .",
