    "the long - standing hypothesis that quasars are powered by accretion onto supermassive black holes ( salpeter 1964 ; lynden - bell 1969 ; rees 1984 ) is now strongly supported by many lines of evidence , including the apparent ubiquity of remnant black holes in the spheroids of local galaxies ( richstone et al .",
    "the strong correlations between the masses of central black holes and the luminosities , dynamical masses , and velocity dispersions of their host spheroids ( e.g. , magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; mclure & dunlop 2002 ; marconi & hunt 2003 ; hring & rix 2004 ; ferrarese & ford 2005 ; greene & ho 2006 ; graham 2007 ; hopkins et al . 2007b ; shankar & ferrarese 2008 ; shankar et al .",
    "2008 ) imply that the processes of black hole growth and bulge formation are intimately linked .",
    "theoretical models typically tie black hole growth to episodes of rapid star formation , perhaps associated with galaxy mergers , and ascribe the black hole - bulge correlations to energy or momentum feedback from the black hole or to regulation of black hole growth by the bulge potential ( e.g. , silk & rees 1998 ; kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ; cavaliere & vittorini 2000 ; granato et al .",

    ". these correlations also make it possible to estimate the mass function of black holes in the local universe ( e.g. , salucci et al .",

    "2004 , s04 hereafter ) .",
    "this local mass function provides important constraints on the co - evolution of the quasar and black hole populations .",
    "the most general and most well known of these constraints is the link between the integrated emissivity of the quasar population , the integrated mass density of remnant black holes , and the average radiative efficiency of black hole accretion ( sotan 1982 ; fabian & iwasawa 1999 ; elvis et al .",
    "2002 ) .    in the paper",
    "we construct self - consistent models of the quasar population using a method that can be considered a `` differential '' generalization of sotan s ( 1982 ) argument . given assumed values of the radiative efficiency and the eddington ratio @xmath16 , the observed luminosity function of quasars at a given redshift can be linked to the average growth rate of black holes of the corresponding mass , and these growth rates can be integrated forward in time to track the evolution of the black hole mass function .",
    "this modeling approach has been developed and applied in a variety of forms by numerous authors , drawing on steadily improving observational data ( e.g. cavaliere et al .",
    "1973 ; small & blandford 1992 ; salucci et al . 1999 ; cavaliere & vittorini 2000 ; yu & tremaine 2002 ; steed & weinberg 2003 , hereafter sw03 ; hosokawa 2004 ; yu & lu 2004 ; marconi et al .",

    "the consensus of recent studies is that evolutionary models with radiative efficiencies of roughly 10% and mildly sub - eddington accretion rates yield a reasonable match to the observational estimates of the remnant mass function .",
    "however , uncertainties in the bolometric luminosity function of active galactic nuclei ( agn , a term we will use to describe both quasars and less luminous systems powered by black hole accretion ) and in the local black hole mass function remain an important source of uncertainty in these conclusions .",
    "we begin our investigation by constructing an estimate of the bolometric agn luminosity function .",
    "our estimate starts from the model of ueda et al .",
    "( 2003 , hereafter u03 ) , based on data from several x - ray surveys , but we adjust its parameters based on more recent optical and x - ray data that provide more complete coverage of luminosity and redshift .",
    "comparison to the x - ray background and to the independent luminosity function estimate of hopkins , richards & hernquist ( 2007 ; hrh07 hereafter ) gives an indication of the remaining uncertainties , associated mainly with bolometric corrections and the fraction of obscured sources . in agreement with marconi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and merloni ( 2004 ) , we find similar trends in the evolution of agn emissivity and the cosmic star formation rate , supporting models in which the growth of black holes occurs together with the formation of stars in their hosts ( e.g. , sanders et al .",
    "1988 ; granato et al . 2004 ; hopkins et al .",
    "we also reassess current estimates of the local black hole mass function , finding that different choices and calibrations of the black hole - bulge correlation lead to significantly different results , with integrated mass densities that span nearly a factor of two .",
    "our simplest models of the evolving black hole and agn populations assume that all active black holes have a single radiative efficiency @xmath17 and a single accretion rate @xmath18 in eddington units . the work of kollmeier et al .",
    "( 2006 ) suggests that a constant value of @xmath18 may be a reasonable approximation for luminous quasars , but the observational evidence on this point is mixed ( e.g. , mclure & dunlop 2004 ; vestergaard 2004 ; babic et al . 2007 ;",
    "bundy et al . 2007 ; netzer & trakhtenbrot 2007 ; netzer et al .",
    "2007 ; rovilos & gorgantopoulos 2007 ; shen et al .",
    "2007b ) , and for lower luminosity , local agn there is clearly a broad range of eddington ratios ( e.g. , heckmann et al .",
    "we also consider models in which @xmath18 depends on redshift or black hole mass , and we consider a simple model of black hole mergers to assess their potential impact on the mass function .",
    "we will examine models with distributions of @xmath18 values and a more realistic treatment of mergers in future work .",
    "our modeling allows a consistency test of the basic scenario in which the observed luminosity of black hole accretion drives the growth of the underlying black hole population , and comparison to the local black hole mass function yields constraints on the average radiative efficiency and the typical accretion rate . for specified @xmath17 and @xmath18",
    ", the model predicts the black hole mass function as a function of time , and combination with the observed luminosity function yields the duty cycle as a function of redshift and black hole mass .",
    "these predictions can be tested against observations of agn host galaxy properties and agn clustering , and they can be used as inputs for further modeling . while significant uncertainties remain , we find that a simple model of the black hole and agn populations achieves a good match to a wide range of observational data .",
    "in order to constrain the accretion history of black holes , it is essential to know the shape and evolution with redshift of the agn bolometric lf .",
    "the determination of this lf is not straightforward , as it must be made using the agn lf _ observed _ in particular bands and converted into bolometric estimates using empirically calibrated bolometric corrections .",
    "the bolometric corrections have been shown by several authors to be redshift independent , with some possible trend with the intrinsic luminosity of the source ( e.g. , elvis et al . 1994 ; marconi et al . 2004 ; richards et al . 2006 ; hopkins et al .",
    "agn surveys have been carried out at several energy ranges , and in each one the detection of sources can be highly affected by intrinsic or instrumental selection effects . in different ranges of redshift and luminosity ,",
    "the best statistics come from different wavebands or surveys , further complicating the effort to create a comprehensive agn lf .",
    "an additional challenge in assembling a reliable and complete census of the agn population is obscuration of the central engine by gas and dust , which may reside in the `` molecular torus '' of unified models ( antonucci 1993 ) or in the interstellar medium of the galactic host ( martinez - sansigr et al .",
    "2005 ; rigby et al .",
    "strong obscuration can eliminate sources from surveys entirely , while uncorrected weak obscuration causes their luminosities to be underestimated . for solar composition gas , the absorption optical depth to x - ray photons is @xmath19 ( e.g. , kembhavi & narlikar 1999 ) . for galactic dust - to - gas ratio ,",
    "the extinction in the rest - frame visual band is @xmath20 ( e.g. , binney & merrifield 2000 ) .",
    "hard x - ray selection is thus the least affected by obscuration , and deep x - ray surveys indeed reveal many faint agns that are missed by traditional optical selection criteria ( e.g. , hasinger et al . 2005 ) .",
    "numerous studies suggest that the incidence of obscuration decreases towards high intrinsic luminosity , so that x - ray and optical lfs agree at the bright end but diverge at low luminosities ( e.g. , u03 ; richards et al . 2005 ; la franca et al . 2005 ; hasinger et al . 2005 ) . statistically speaking",
    ", there is fairly good correspondence between x - ray agns with @xmath21 and broad - line optical agns ( e.g. , tozzi et al .",
    "even 2 - 10 kev selection becomes highly incomplete for compton - thick sources , with @xmath22 , and the best constraints on this population come from the normalization and spectral shape of the x - ray background .",
    "given these considerations , we have chosen to base our bolometric lf estimate principally on the work of u03 , who compiled a vast sample from _ chandra _ , _ asca _ , and _ heao_-1 surveys and inferred the absorption - corrected lf in the rest - frame 2 - 10 kev band out to @xmath23 .",
    "we adopt the luminosity - dependent bolometric correction of marconi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ; we include a dispersion of 0.2 dex in this correction ( see , e.g. , elvis et al .",
    "1994 ) , but omitting the scatter would not significantly affect our results .",
    "u03 fit their data with a parameterized model of luminosity - dependent density evolution .",
    "we adopt the model and adjust its parameters in some redshift ranges to better fit other data sets , especially at high redshifts and at bright luminosities at low redshifts .",
    "we note that many other studies have reported general trends of the lf evolution and obscuring columns similar to those of u03 ( e.g. , la franca et al . 2005 ) , and that infrared surveys also suggest a substantial population of obscured agns at low luminosities ( treister et al .",
    "2006 ; see also ballantyne and papovich 2007 ) .",

    "the full list of parameters is given in table  [ table|lf ] .",
    "some of the parameters assume different values in different redshift intervals , in which case we apply a linear interpolation in @xmath28 between these intervals , as reported in table  [ table|lf ] .",

    "we plot @xmath50 , instead of simply @xmath51 itself , to highlight the luminosity bins where most of the energy is emitted .",
    "for the same reason , we will later plot the black hole mass function as @xmath52 to highlight the mass bins in which most of the density resides .",

    "the dashed curves show the contribution of all sources with @xmath54 , while the solid curves include higher column density ( compton - thick ) systems .",
    "we assume that the number of compton - thick sources in each luminosity bin is equal to the number of sources in the column density range @xmath55 .",
    "we will henceforth follow the x - ray convention of describing systems with @xmath56 as `` type i '' agn and systems with @xmath57 as type ii agn .",
    "we roughly expect the `` type i '' curve ( dot - dashed ) to agree with optical survey data points and the `` type i+type ii '' curve to agree with x - ray survey data points .",
    "the agreement between the model and the data is overall fairly good , though in some regimes different data sets give seemingly incompatible results , making it difficult to judge the validity of the model itself .",
    "hrh07 have used their observationally constrained theoretical models to estimate the fraction of agn that are `` missing '' from observational samples because of obscuration , as a function of waveband and luminosity . in figure",
    "[ fig|bollfcorrected ] , we plot data points corrected for these obscured fractions , with the same model curves as figure  [ fig|bollf ] .",
    "if the data , the obscuration corrections , and our model were all perfect , then all of the data points should line up with each other and with the solid model curves .",
    "the obscuration corrections do reduce the discrepancies among data sets , most notably in the range @xmath58 , but they do not remove all of the differences .",
    "the upper envelope of the data points is generally close to our model near the peak of @xmath50 , though at the highest luminosities the model exceeds the data ( principally sdss ) for @xmath59 .    in figure  [ fig|xrbgs ]",
    "we show the integrated intensity obtained from our model agn lf compared with all the available data on the cosmic x - ray background ( xrbg ) for energies above 1 kev .",

    "( 2007 ) , plus the recent results from _ integral _ ( churazov et al . 2006 ) .",
    "while the shape of the xrbg is now well established at low energies ( 2 - 10 kev band ) , different studies imply normalizations that differ by up to 40% .",
    "the minimum estimate for the normalization was found by the very first _",
    "heao _ experiments ( e.g. , marshall et al .",
    "1980 ; filled circles in figure  [ fig|xrbgs ] ) , while the much more recent _ chandra _ and _ xmm _ results point towards higher values ( shaded bands in figure  [ fig|xrbgs ] ; see comastri 2004 for a review ) .",
    "several groups have assumed that the _ heao _ measurements were correct in shape but underestimated in normalization because of flux calibration and/or instrumental background subtraction ( frontera et al .",
    "2007 ) , implying a true xrbg spectrum that is @xmath60 times the _ heao _ spectrum at all energies .",
    "however , recent measurements from _ integral _ ( churazov et al . 2006 ; open circles in figure  [ fig|xrbgs ] ) and from the _ pds _ instrument aboard _ bepposax _",
    "( frontera et al . 2007 ) produce results close to the original _ heao _ measurements in the @xmath61 20 - 100 kev range .",
    "based on the agreement of multiple experiments in overlapping energy ranges , we tentatively conclude that the true xrbg spectrum approximately follows the _ integral _ points over the range @xmath61 5 - 100 kev .    the solid curve in figure  [ fig|xrbgs ] shows the xrbg predicted by our agn bolometric lf model with the u03 column density distribution .",
    "following u03 , we use the pexrav code ( magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) to generate spectra of families of agn with different column densities , also taking into account compton down - scattering for highly obscured sources ( wilman & fabian 1999 ) .",
    "we compute the spectra of compton - thick ( @xmath62 ) sources assuming @xmath63 .",
    "dashed , dot - dashed , and triple - dot - dashed curves show the cumulative contributions of sources with @xmath64 , and 24 , respectively .",
    "the compton - thick sources increase the predicted xrbg by a factor of about 1.3 at @xmath65 kev , with smaller contributions at lower energies and at much higher energies .",
    "our full model would be a good match to the _ heao _ spectrum renormalized by a constant factor of @xmath60 as proposed in some earlier studies .",
    "however , it significantly overpredicts the _ integral _ and _ sax / pds _ results at @xmath66 kev ; these are well matched by the contribution of @xmath54 sources alone , with _ no _ compton - thick contribution . as noted above , we employ u03 s prescription for the luminosity dependence of the compton - thick fraction . if we use a simpler model",
    "in which the number of compton - thick sources is @xmath67 of the number of @xmath68 sources at all luminosities , then we obtain very similar xrbg predictions ( higher by a few percent near the peak and even closer at other energies ) .",
    "we conclude from figure  [ fig|xrbgs ] that the compton - thick fraction in our standard model is probably an upper limit on the true fraction , and in our calculations below we will also consider a model in which the compton - thick fraction is zero",
    ". however , gilli et al . ( 2007 ) have proposed a successful model to fit the @xmath69 measurements of the xrbg that uses a combined contribution from unobscured sources ( which they define to be only those with @xmath70 ) a factor @xmath61 2 below our estimate and a higher contribution from obscured sources up to @xmath71 , which they derive by assuming that these sources have a gaussian distribution of spectral indices around a mean slope @xmath72 . with this result in mind",
    ", we will also explore models with a higher fraction of compton - thick sources ( but our standard estimate of unobscured sources ) .    reproducing the high background normalization found by _",
    "xmm _ in the 2 - 5 kev range would require a substantially higher contribution from type i agn , since obscured agn have little emission at these energies .",
    "such an increase seems implausible on other grounds .",
    "following schirber & bullock ( 2003 ) and miralda - escud ( 2003 ) , we have estimated the average hydrogen ionization rate produced by type i x - ray agn with optical luminosity @xmath73 assuming uv spectral energy index @xmath74 . using the redshift - dependent x - ray - to - optical ratio by steffen et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , we find that the type i agns produce an emissivity that saturates the estimated uv background intensity at @xmath75 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the true agn contribution to the xrbg is probably closer to our model prediction than to the @xmath76 band shown in figure  [ fig|xrbgs ] .",
    "if future missions confirm a high normalization of the xrbg in the 2 - 5 kev range , it would probably mean that a substantial contribution from x - ray binaries in normal galaxies is present at these energies .",
    "on the other hand , we note from figure  [ fig|bollf ] that our agn lf defined for sources with @xmath53 is consistent with , or even lower than , all optical survey estimates , so we do not expect a much _ lower _ contribution from these sources .",
    "hrh07 have recently undertaken an exercise similar to ours , attempting to construct a bolometric agn lf that is consistent with a wide range of data over a large span of energies and wavelengths .",
    "figure  [ fig|hopkinslf ] compares our model to theirs .",
    "we find good agreement in the shape and overall normalization of the agn lf in the redshift range @xmath77 and @xmath78 , while at intermediate redshifts our model lf is systematically lower .",
    "the normalization difference arises because hrh07 adopt an x - ray bolometric correction that is about @xmath79 higher ( at typical luminosities ) than the marconi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) bolometric correction used here .",
    "if we adopt the hrh07 bolometric correction , then we find good agreement in the range @xmath80 , but our model lf is higher at high and low redshifts . at @xmath81",
    "we adopt a steeper bright - end lf slope based on the results of goods ( fontanot et al .",
    "2006 ) , cool et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and shankar & mathur ( 2007 ) , who find evidence for a steeper slope relative to the estimates of richards et al . (",
    "2006 ) . however , at @xmath82 the hrh07 bright - end slope is steeper than ours , since they effectively require a match to the sdss - based measurements of richards et al .",
    "( 2004 ) in this redshift range , while we retain the shallower slope adopted by u03 , also supported by recent x - ray lf determination of silverman et al .",
    "recent spitzer studies ( hickox et al . 2007 ; polletta et al . 2008 ) suggest a significant fraction of obscured agn even at high luminosities , leaving some room for a slope difference between the optical and bolometric lfs .",
    "we regard the differences between our model lf and that of hrh07 , derived from independent attempts to match the full range of current data , as a reasonable representation of the remaining systematic uncertainties in determination of the bolometric agn luminosity function .",
    "we will show in   [ subsec|models ] that the difference between these two determinations does not alter our overall conclusions , but the differences in normalization and shape at intermediate redshifts do lead to different preferred accretion parameters for the black hole population .",
    "marconi et al . ( 2004 ) and s04 found similar results for the local black hole mass function , using somewhat different methods .",
    "both groups found that starting from the relation between black hole mass and bulge velocity dispersion ( @xmath83 ) or the relation between black hole mass and bulge luminosity ( @xmath84 ) led to similar local mass functions .",

    "massive black holes therefore build their mass relatively early while low mass black holes grow later , the phenomenon often referred to as `` downsizing '' .",
    "our results on mean radiative efficiency and duty cycle evolution are also in qualitative agreement with those found by haiman et al .",
    "the predicted duty cycles seem in reasonable accord with observational estimates , though these estimates have considerable uncertainty and do not , as yet , probe mass and redshift dependence in much detail .",
    "the electronic tables described in   [ subsec|tables ] provide tabulations as a function of redshift of our agn bolometric lf estimate , the hrh07 lf , and black hole mass functions and duty cycles for single-@xmath154 models that are in good agreement with the observed @xmath10 mass functions given these lf inputs .",
    "we have examined models in which the eddington ratio accretion rate @xmath154 is reduced at low redshift or at low black hole mass .",
    "declining redshift evolution of @xmath154 damps `` downsizing , '' reducing the dependence of duty cycles on black hole mass and redshift .",
    "this model produces a typical duty cycle @xmath341 at @xmath10 , about two orders of magnitude higher than in the reference model and consistent with the local duty cycle inferred from observations by greene & ho ( 2007 ) . in general terms , the observed luminosity - dependent density evolution of the agn lf can be explained by preferential suppression of activity in high mass black holes at low redshift , by a decline in the typical accretion rate at low redshift , or by some combination thereof .",
    "the mass - dependent @xmath154 model associates more of the agn emissivity to high mass black holes , so it predicts a @xmath10 mass function that is more sharply peaked , in better agreement with the estimates of hopkins et al .",
    "( 2007b ) and graham et al .",
    "( 2007 ) but worse agreement with other estimates .",
    "this model predicts a stronger mass dependence of duty cycles than our reference model because it maps low mass black holes , whose abundance is already suppressed , to less luminous , and hence more common , agn .    we have also considered a model in which each black hole has a @xmath112 probability per hubble time of merging with another black hole of equal mass .",
    "merger - driven growth in this model has little impact on the black hole mass function until @xmath342 , when accretion - driven evolution has slowed .",
    "low redshift mergers slightly depress the low mass end of the @xmath10 mass function and significantly enhance the high mass tail , worsening the agreement with observational estimates .",
    "models incorporating theoretically predicted merger rates can allow more realistic calculations of the impact of mergers on the black hole population ; this impact will probably be smaller than in the simplified model considered here .",
    "we have calculated the clustering bias of agn as a function of luminosity and redshift for our reference model , assuming a monotonic relation between black hole mass and halo mass .",
    "the predictions are in reasonable accord with observational estimates",
    ". we will examine agn clustering predictions in more detail in future work , with attention to what models can be excluded by the data and what can be learned by matching the full agn correlation function in addition to an overall bias factor .",
    "mhd simulations ( e.g. , gammie et al .",
    "2004 ; shapiro 2005 ) show that disk accretion onto kerr black holes spins them up to an equilibrium spin rate @xmath343 ( where @xmath344 is the angular momentum parameter for a maximally rotating black hole ) .",
    "the radiative efficiency in these models is @xmath345 .",
    "these high efficiencies would lead to black hole mass densities a factor of two or more below our central estimate , and below our estimated lower bound .",
    "furthermore , our results show that models with @xmath17 in the range @xmath346 can achieve a good match to the overall shape of the black hole mass function near the peak in @xmath52 , not just the value of @xmath0 , given plausible choices of @xmath154 .",
    "systematic uncertainties in the agn lf do not appear large enough to accommodate @xmath347 .",
    "accommodating these high efficiencies would instead require a substantial downward revision of recent estimates of the local black hole mass function , reducing the integrated mass density to @xmath348 .",
    "our results are consistent with a scenario like the one of king & pringle ( 2006 ) in which chaotic accretion spins down black holes because of counter - alignment with the accretion disk angular momentum , or with other mechanisms that reduce efficiencies below the mhd - simulation predictions .",
    "the assumption that all active black holes at a given mass and redshift have the same @xmath154 is clearly an idealization , at least in the local universe where observations indicate a wide range of eddington ratios ( heckman et al .",
    "2005 ; greene & ho 2007 ) .",
    "steed & weinberg ( 2003 ) and yu & lu ( 2004 ) discussed continuity equation models evolved adopting a distribution of eddington ratios .",
    "in particular , yu & lu ( 2004 ) have derived the relation between the integrated number of agns shining at all times at a given luminosity @xmath127 , the mean light curve of black holes , and the local black hole mass function .",
    "following their equation ( 18 ) , we find that a good match between the cumulative number of agns and of relic black holes can be achieved for @xmath349 ( required by the sotan argument ) and a mean agn light curve exponentially increasing with @xmath350 and a negligible declining phase , similar to our reference model .",
    "alternatively , we find that a good match can be obtained by assuming that black holes grow rapidly in a super - eddington phase with @xmath351 and then have a long declining phase , qualitatively resembling our @xmath352 model discussed in   [ subsec|etamdot ] . in future work",
    "we will investigate models that incorporate multiple @xmath154-values and accretion modes , including the addition of modest log - normal scatter in @xmath353 ( e.g. , kollmeier et al .  2005 ; netzer et al.2007 ; shen et al .",
    "2007b ) and sharper revisions in which some black holes accrete at super - eddington or highly sub - eddington rates , perhaps with reduced radiative efficiencies",
    "( narayan , mahadevan , & quataert 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "we will also incorporate mergers at the rates predicted by theoretical models of cold dark matter subhalos and their associated black holes ( yoo et al .",
    "2007 ) . for appropriate parameter choices",
    ", we expect that many scenarios can be made consistent with the observed agn lf and the local black hole mass function .",
    "however , direct measurements of eddington ratio distributions and measurements of agn clustering and host properties , all as a function of luminosity and redshift , should greatly narrow the field of viable models . within the ( often substantial ) uncertainties of existing data , a simple model in which all black holes grow by accreting gas at mildly sub - eddington rates with a radiative efficiency @xmath354 is surprisingly successful at reproducing a wide range of observations .",
