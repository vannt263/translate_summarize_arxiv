    "with the two recent papers @xcite , @xcite we started a series of works aimed at studying quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) ( as well as other nonlinear abelian theories that may be historically traced back to @xcite ) under the conditions where the intrinsic nonlinearity of the theory shows itself not only as interaction of electromagnetic fields with a strong background , but also with themselves .",
    "manifestations of nonlinearity of the first type mentioned have been a focus of attention during many years since , perhaps , the pioneering works erber66bb70 , birula ( see @xcite and more recent papers karbstein , shauso10 for some reviews of the subsequent advances in that field ) . the strong background was served in the corresponding studies by the constant and homogeneous electromagnetic field ( note , however , ref .",
    "gies , where a certain inhomogeneity was introduced , and ref .",
    "gavgit12 , where it was shown that a strong nonhomogeneous magnetic field is able to produce pairs of neutral fermions from the vacuum ) and by the field of a plane wave ( see the review of the laser - associated researches in @xcite ) , because in these cases the influence of the background could be exactly taken into account for arbitrarily large value of their amplitude through the use of exact solutions of the dirac equation available for such cases .",
    "the dirac propagators for the virtual electrons and positrons in feynman graphs for the vacuum polarization were the agents of interaction with the background field in the intermediate state .    in those works the varying electromagnetic fields",
    "are treated as small perturbations of the background , and only the effects linear in their amplitudes are taken into account , such as birefringence , photon capture by a magnetic field @xcite , modification of the coulomb law @xcite , magnetic shift of the critical charge value @xcite ,  and even the positronium collapse shauso06 may be placed among effects of this class .",
    "the arena of applicability of these results is mostly the pulsars and magnetars , possessing sufficiently large magnetic fields .",
    "in contrast with the above , in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and in the present paper we are considering the effects , quadratic and cubic in the amplitude of the perturbation . as a matter of fact ,",
    "two important  special examples of such effects were studied before , which were the processes of photon splitting in a magnetic @xcite and crossed @xcite fields , and the light - by - light scattering  berlifpit , all taken on the photon mass shell .",
    "our goal is to deal with excitations of the vacuum , different from photons , subject to nonlinear version of the maxwell equations , stemming from qed or , more generally , intrinsic to any other nonlinear electrodynamics .",
    "whereas handling many - photon matrix elements beyond the photon mass shell , necessary for addressing a general nonlinear problem , turns out to be overcomplicated , we succeeded to indicate a simple approximation able to take responsibility for nonlinear effects in a universal manner and independent of an expansion in powers of the fine structure constant @xmath0 as far as qed is concerned .",
    "all kernels in the nonlinear integro - differential maxwell equations are given in terms of variational field - derivatives of the effective action @xmath1 defined as @xcite the generating functional of irreducible vertices in qed , or as an action that fixes a theory in other versions of nonlinear electrodynamics .",
    "the approximation we are dealing with is referred to as the local or infrared approximation .",
    "it assumes that the effective action functional is local , i.e. , it does not depend on the space - time derivatives of the field strength .",
    "true , this assumption restricts the range of applicability to only slow - varying fields in space and time , but it enables us to efficiently advance in describing the effects , cubic and quadratic in the field strength . by acting along these lines where there is no background  field @xcite , we reproduced the known @xcite correction to the coulomb field which is cubic in the charge that produces it , and found cubic equations for dipole moments of selfinteracting fields of magnetic and electric dipoles that may be also viewed upon as nonlinear renormalizations of these quantities .  in ref .",
    "@xcite we studied quadratic response of the background constant and homogeneous magnetic field to an applied electric field of a static charge at rest , and we found this response to be purely magnetic . in the present paper we continue the investigation of that magneto - electric effect , and we establish that the static charge placed into a background magnetic field is a magnetic dipole with its magnetic moment proportional to the charge squared and parallel to the background field , unless the charge distribution violates the initial cylindric symmetry of the problem .",
    "( this situation resembles our results @xcite in noncommutative electrodynamics . )",
    "more explicit formulae for the magnetic field in the short and long ranges , for its lines of force and for the magnetic moment are presented referring to a simple example , where the applied electrostatic field is central - symmetric and would correspond , if in a nondispersive vacuum , to a charge distributed homogeneously inside a finite - radius sphere .    in the rest of the present introduction we recall the basic equations of nonlinear electrodynamics , truncated at the third power of the varying field , against a constant homogeneous background ,",
    "define the kernels in them as the second- and the third - rank polarization tensors in terms of the field - derivatives of the effective action , introduce nonlinearly - induced currents , and give expressions for the varying fields in terms of the currents based on the use of eigenvector expansion of the second - rank polarization tensor and the photon green function . in section 2",
    "the second- and third - rank polarization tensors in a magnetic field are written in the infrared approximation as expressed in terms of the second and third derivatives of the delta - functions of the coordinate differences . the previously found linear - response correction to the coulomb field of an arbitrarily distributed static charge at large distances in a magnetic field",
    "are given for completeness , and the general structure of quadratic response , which is purely magnetic , is analyzed in terms of eigenmodes contribution . in section 3 very explicit expressions for the induced current and the magnetic field",
    "are fully elaborated using the simplest example , where the applied electric field is that of a homogeneously charged sphere of finite radius .",
    "differential equations for the shape of the magnetic lines of force are solved , and the resulting pattern is drawn in figs . 1 and 2 inside and outside the charge . the magnetic moment of the charge , proportional to its square , is given in terms of the background magnetic field and the radius of the charge . in section 4",
    "it is shown that spherically - nonsymmetric charge distributions also are characterized by a magnetic dipole moment , which is parallel to the background magnetic field , if the charge distribution does not specify any new direction in the space .",

    "besides , it should be noted that @xmath181 and @xmath324 can be written in a simplified form,@xmath333such that after finding @xmath334 we can immediately derive @xmath335 and @xmath324 .",
