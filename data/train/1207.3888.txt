    "<S> these findings strongly suggest that materials with bis@xmath2 layers provide yet another family for layered superconductors exhibiting double - digit @xmath9 , and it is of special importance to understand the underlying electronic structure of these materials .    </S>",
    "<S> recent studies have shown that effective models constructed from first principles band calculation can provide solid basis for the study on the mechanism of superconductivity , especially for materials with complicated band structures such as the iron pnictides@xcite . in the present paper </S>",

    "<S> we present results without the spin - orbit coupling , although this coupling does have some effect on the band structure . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation result is shown in fig.[fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the conduction bands around the fermi level consists mainly of in - plane bi @xmath4 orbital character , mixed with in - plane s @xmath5 .     and 0.5.,width=264 ]    -wave for attractive pairing interactions such as mediated by phonons or charge fluctuations , ( b ) sign reversing @xmath19-wave , and ( c ) @xmath20-wave superconducting gaps obtained for repulsive pairing interactions mediated by spin fluctuations.,width=302 ]    from this band calculation , we obtain maximally localized wannier orbitals@xcite , which enables us to construct tightbinding models that correctly reproduces the original first principles band structure around the fermi level . first , we construct a 24 orbital model , which consists of six bi @xmath4 , twelve s @xmath5 and six o @xmath21 orbitals . the band structure of the obtained tight binding model is shown in fig.[fig3](a ) . here , </S>",
    "<S> the thickness of the lines represent the weight of the in - plane @xmath6 orbitals within the bis@xmath2 layers . </S>",
    "<S> since the bis@xmath2 layers are without doubt the origin of the superconductivity , we can further obtain a model that omits the o @xmath21 orbitals , the @xmath5 orbitals of the out - of - plane s , and also the @xmath22 orbital of the in - plane s ( whose bands lie away from the fermi level ) , and we are left with an eight orbital model ( band not shown , see supplementary material@xcite ) . there are eight orbitals because there are two bis@xmath2 layers per unit cell , and each bi and in - plane s has two @xmath6 orbitals . note that we should extract the portion of the bands that is relevant to the bis@xmath2 layers since the many body interactions ( which should be included in the forthcoming studies ) take place mainly within this layer . by further neglecting the small interlayer coupling between the neighboring bis@xmath2 layers , we end up with a two - dimensional `` @xmath6-@xmath6 '' four orbital model consisting of two bi @xmath4 and two s @xmath5 orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> the band structure of this model is shown in fig.[fig3](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> we write the model hamiltonian in the form @xmath23 + \\sum_{i\\mu\\sigma}\\varepsilon_\\mu n_{i\\mu\\sigma},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 creates an electron with spin @xmath25 on the @xmath26-th orbital in the @xmath27-th unit cell , and @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> then , the parameters of this four orbital model is given in table[tab1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the two @xmath6 orbitals are denoted as @xmath17 and @xmath15 , where the @xmath29-@xmath30 axis are rotated by 45 degrees from the @xmath31-@xmath32 axes ( an figure of the four orbital model is not presented , but see fig.[fig4](a ) for the @xmath29 and @xmath30 axes . ) </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that the upper and the lower bands are roughly symmetric with respect to the gap .    </S>",
    "<S> .hopping parameters @xmath33 or the on - site energies @xmath34 for the four orbital model . </S>",
    "<S> the orbitals @xmath35 correspond to bi @xmath15 , @xmath17 , s @xmath15 , @xmath17 orbitals , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we follow the notations in ref.@xcite , i.e. , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 corresponds to @xmath38 , @xmath39 , respectively , where ` @xmath40 ' means that the corresponding hopping is equal to @xmath41 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> [ tab1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the one - dimensional nature of the bands provides good nesting of the fermi surface . to see this effect , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate for the two orbital model the @xmath42 irreducible susceptibility matrix in the orbital representation , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the @xmath45 bare green s function matrix . in fig.[fig5 ] , we show the largest eigenvalue of the irreducible susceptibility matrix for the doping ratio of @xmath14 and @xmath16 . the diagonal structures that go through ( 0,0 ) or @xmath13 are due to the nesting shown by the arrows in fig.[fig4](d ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that if the nearest neighbor hoppings do not exist and the bands have the form in eq.([eq1 ] ) , the nestings ( i)@xmath46 ( iii ) are equivalent , while this equivalence is lost in the presence of @xmath47 ( and additional hoppings ) .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , let us discuss the possible pairing states and the superconducting gap structure . </S>",
    "<S> since the many - body term of the effective hamiltonian is not determined here , there are several possibilities at present . </S>",
    "<S> the most relevant bands have mainly @xmath4 character , which gives wide spread of the wannier orbitals , so that the electron - electron interactions may not be very strong and short - ranged as in the @xmath48-orbital based materials such as the cuprates and iron - based superconductors . in that case </S>",
    "<S> , the electron - phonon interaction can be playing the main role in the cooper pairing , and the good nesting of the fermi surface may cooperate to give enhanced attractive pairing interaction around the nesting vectors . </S>",
    "<S> this can give rise to a @xmath19-wave pairing with constant gap sign as shown in fig.[fig6](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to point out that bi - based superconductors ( ba , k)(bi , p)o@xmath10@xcite are also known to have fermi surface nesting , but with o-@xmath21 and bi-@xmath49 orbital character@xcite , differnt from the present material . a more exotic possibility for the same type of gap is related to the fact that the system is close to a band insulator , where electron - hole excitations might be playing an important role in the pairing@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , if we consider electron - electron interactions in the four orbital model , the system can be viewed as two interacting charge - transfer - type insulating bands . </S>",
    "<S> this is similar to the situation studied in ref.@xcite , where the occurrence of superconductivity was proposed for systems with a metallic band interacting with a charge - transfer - type insulating band . in this context </S>",
    "<S> , it should be noted that the analysis for the bi @xmath4-s @xmath5 four orbital model can give different results from those for the two orbital model regarding the superconducting state , because the band filling is different , i.e. , the four orbital model is a nearly half - filled , electron - hole symmetric system , while the two orbital model has small band filling .    </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , if we assume a short ranged repulsive interaction , the present two orbital model provides a fundamental problem of the pairing state in repulsively interacting quasi - one - dimensional systems , apart from its relevance to the bis@xmath2 layers . </S>",
    "<S> namely , the occurrence of superconductivity in repulsively interacting one - dimensional systems with a double well type band structure was studied in the late 1990 s , where the interaction ( ii ) in fig.[fig4](d ) dominates for certain parameter regime to give a gap that reverses its sign between the inner and the outer fermi points@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of @xmath47 in fig.[fig4](a ) is essential in this case , because this makes the interactions ( i)/(iii ) and ( ii ) inequivalent . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , by adding on - site intra- ( @xmath50 ) and inter - orbital interactions ( @xmath51 and the hund s coupling and the pair hoppings @xmath52 ) , and applying multiorbital random phase approximation@xcite to obtain the spin - fluctuation - mediated pairing interaction , we find the sign reversing @xmath19-wave gap shown in fig.[fig6](b ) for large doping ( e.g. , @xmath16 and @xmath53ev ) and the @xmath20-wave superconducting gap shown in fig.[fig6](c ) for small doping ( e.g. , @xmath14 and @xmath54ev ) .    </S>",
    "<S> these gaps are determined by cooperation / competition between the repulsive ( sign reversing ) spin - singlet pairing interactions driven by the nestings given in fig.[fig4](d ) . </S>",
    "<S> the gap ( b ) indeed exhibits sign reverse between the inner and the outer fermi surfaces . on the other hand , gap ( c ) </S>",
    "<S> is obtained by reversing the gap sign for both interactions ( i ) and ( ii ) . to make the gap have </S>",
    "<S> even parity requires additional nodes at @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the reason why this @xmath20-wave is favored for small doping is because the diagonal nodes do not intersect the fermi surface in this situation . in an ideal situation , gaps ( a ) and ( b)/(c ) </S>",
    "<S> can be distinguished by @xmath56 measurement in the nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) experiments . </S>",
    "<S> for gap ( a ) , @xmath56 should exhibit a coherence peak followed by a steep decrease , while for ( b)/(c ) the coherence peak should be ( nearly ) absent . </S>",
    "<S> it is more difficult to distinguish ( b ) and ( c ) because even for the @xmath20-wave case ( c ) , the nodes intersecting the fermi surface are accidental . therefore , other phase sensitive experiments are necessary .    finally , yet another possibility related with the quasi - one - dimensionality is the spin - triplet pairing . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the present band structure also has similarity with the quasi - one - dimensional bands ( the hybridized @xmath57 bands ) in sr@xmath2ruo@xmath8 , where some theoretical studies have suggested the possibility of spin - triplet pairing originating from these bands@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nmr experiments will also provide a test for this possibility .    to summarize </S>",
    "<S> , we have obtained effective tightbinding models for the superconducting bis@xmath2 layers by performing band calculation for laobis@xmath2 and exploiting the maximally localized wannier orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> the model consists of @xmath17 and @xmath15 orbitals , and the dominant next nearest neighbor hoppings lead to quasi - one - dimensional bands , which give nesting of the fermi surface . considering the quasi - one - dimensional as well as the doped - band - insulator nature of the band structure , </S>",
    "<S> there are several interesting possibilities of the superconducting state depending on the dominating many - body interactions . </S>"
