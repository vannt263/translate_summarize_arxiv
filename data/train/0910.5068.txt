    "the standard model ( sm ) of strong , electromagnetic and weak interactions is based on local gauge invariance under the group @xmath2 , spontaneously broken to @xmath3 .",
    "the spontaneous breaking of gauge invariance gives masses to the gauge bosons @xmath4 and @xmath5 corresponding to three of the generators of the gauge group in a way which maintains the renormalizability of the theory .",
    "the gauge bosons corresponding to the @xmath6 gauge group of electromagnetism and the @xmath7 gauge group of colour remain massless .",
    "the spontaneous braking is also required to give masses to the fermions in the theory .",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) in the sm is achieved by means of the higgs mechanism .",
    "an @xmath8 doublet of spin-0 fields is present in the theory , and the configuration which minimizes the action corresponds to a nonzero value for the neutral component of the doublet .",
    "thus , the ground state ( vacuum state ) of the theory is not invariant under the @xmath8 group , and the gauge symmetry is broken spontaneously . since it is the neutral component of the scalar doublet which has a nonzero vacuum expectation value , @xmath6 remains an unbroken symmetry .    as a result of ssb ,",
    "three of the four degrees of freedom of the complex scalar doublet , get absorbed resulting in the longitudinal degrees of freedom of the ( massive ) gauge bosons .",
    "these are the so - called `` would - be goldstone '' modes , since the goldstone mechanism for a spontaneously broken _ global _ invariance would have required these modes to propagate as massless particles .",
    "there remains one scalar field , the particle corresponding to which becomes massive .",
    "this massive spin-0 particle is known as the higgs boson .",
    "the introduction of spin-0 fields in the theory , while successful in breaking the electroweak gauge invariance to generate masses for gauge bosons and fermions , leads to certain problems .",
    "the main problem is that the mass of the higgs boson can not be made small in a natural way . as a result ,",
    "alternative proposals for have been considered for the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking , some of which do not result in a light higgs boson .",
    "the issue of the mechanism of spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking is thus an important one .",
    "if the higgs boson is discovered with properties predicted by sm , it would be a proof of higgs mechanism . if the higgs boson is not found , which would imply that it is either not present or very heavy , alternative mechanisms of ssb would have to be taken seriously .",
    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern , geneva , which in the very near future will collide protons on protons at a centre - of - mass energy of 14 tev , is expected to unravel the mystery of the mechanism of ssb of the local gauge invariance responsible for the electroweak interactions .",
    "if the sm higgs boson exists , and is light , it will be found .",
    "alternatively , if the symmetry breaking is not due to a straightforward higgs mechanism , or if the higgs boson is not light , lhc should show other effects , particularly in scattering of weak gauge bosons .",
    "scattering of longitudinally polarized weak bosons play a dominant role , and in the absence of a light higgs boson , it is expected to become strong .",
    "thus @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 scattering ( where the subscript @xmath12 denotes the longitudinal polarization mode ) , will be an important tool to study the mechanism of ssb .",
    "here we discuss the importance of studying gauge - boson scattering as a means of gaining knowledge about the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanisms , and also the feasibility of carrying out such a study at lhc .",
    "there have been a number of studies on strong gauge - boson scattering over the years .",
    "since it is next to impossible to do an exhaustive review here , we will be forced to be selective .",
    "we begin by discussing general features of scattering of massive spin-1 particles and specialize to the case when these particles are the gauge bosons of a spontaneously broken local gauge theory .",
    "amplitudes for scattering in theories with massive spin-1 particles can have bad high - energy behaviour .",
    "the propagator for a massive spin-1 field has a term which does not decrease with increasing momentum , leading to bad high - energy behaviour in amplitudes involving exchange of these vector particles .",
    "this can make the theory non - renormalizable . in theories with ssb , using the higgs mechanism , renormalizability",
    "is maintained because higgs exchange can cancel the bad high - energy behaviour arising from vector exchange .",
    "amplitudes with massive vector particles in the initial and final states have bad high - energy behaviour because the polarization vector has the form _",
    "l^(k ) . in the unitarity gauge ,",
    "scattering of longitudinally polarized gauge bosons would have the largest amplitudes at high energy . in the high - energy limit",
    ", the amplitude for @xmath13 takes the form [ gaugeamp ] m^gauge = -u + o((e / m_w)^0 ) , where @xmath14 is the mandelstam variable . again ,",
    "if the mass of the vector fields arises through a higgs mechanism , the bad high - energy behaviour is cured .",
    "the contribution of @xmath15 and @xmath16 channel higgs exchanges is    lcl m^higgs & = & - + & & u ,    in the limit @xmath17 , which cancels the bad high - energy behaviour of ( [ gaugeamp ] ) .",
    "however , if the higgs mass is too high ( @xmath18 ) , the amplitude can be large , leading to a strongly - interacting gauge sector",
    ". the study of @xmath0 scattering can thus be important in studying the mechanism of symmetry breaking .",
    "( here , as well in what follows , we use @xmath0 to denote @xmath0 , @xmath19 as well as @xmath20 combinations ) .",
    "vector - boson scattering amplitudes at high energies may be calculated using the equivalence theorem @xcite .",
    "the equivalence theorem relates the @xmath9 scattering amplitude in the feynman-thooft gauge to the amplitude for scattering of the corresponding `` would - be '' goldstone scalars at high energy ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "thus ,    l m(w_lw_l w_lw_l ) = m(ww ww ) + m(z_lz_l z_lz_l ) = m(zz zz ) + m(w_lz_l w_lz_l ) = m(wz wz ) + m(w_lw_l z_lz_l ) = m(ww zz ) ,    where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are respectively the scalar modes which provide the longitudinal modes for @xmath1 and @xmath5 respectively .",
    "goldstone boson interactions are governed by low - energy theorems for energy below the symmetry breaking scale ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "low - energy theorems are analogous to those obtained for @xmath25 scattering in the chiral lagrangian @xcite , and depend only on the symmetry of the theory .",
    "thus , when there is no light higgs ( with @xmath26  tev or so ) , the low - energy theorems combined with equivalence theorem can predict @xmath9 scattering amplitudes from the symmetries of the theory to leading order in @xmath27 .",
    "the specific theory for symmetry breaking then shows up at the next higher order in @xmath27 .    in the standard model ( sm )",

    ".      a limit may be obtained from unitarity , if the tree amplitudes are to be valid at high energies . in the absence of the higgs ,",
    "the amplitudes violate unitarity at high energies .",
    "the limit is of the order of the symmetry breaking scale .",
    "the higgs can not be very heavy , or else the unitarity limit would be crossed too soon . to see this , write the old - fashioned scattering amplitude @xmath37 , so that @xmath38",
    ". then we have f_cm = .",
    "the scattering amplitude has the partial wave expansion f ( ) = _",

    "unitarity is expressed by the optical theorem relation = ( 4/k ) i m f(0 ) . for elastic scattering ,",
    "the phase shift @xmath40 is real , but has a positive imaginary part if there is inelasticity .",
    "a convenient way to express elastic unitarity is [ a_l^-1 ] = -1 . from this",
    "it follows that a_l 1 ; a_l .",
    "the @xmath41 partial - wave unitarity for large @xmath42 for @xmath0 scattering then gives , in the absence of the higgs boson , a_0 < 1/2 .",
    "thus , for large enough @xmath42 , unitarity is violated .",
    "the best bound comes from the isospin zero channel @xmath43 , viz .",
    ", s < ( 1.2)^2 .    in the case of the standard higgs mechanism ,",
    "unitarity is restored by the exchange of a light higgs boson . for unitarity to hold in the presence of the higgs boson",
    ", the mass of the higgs boson should satisfy m_h^2 < .",
    "this gives a limit of @xmath44 tev .",
    "similar limits may be obtained by considering other partial - wave channels .",
    "if there is no light higgs , the perturbative unitarity limit is violated , and the gauge interactions are no longer weak .",
    "we then have a strong gauge sector .",
    "this could lead to the possibility of strong - interaction resonances , as seen in the case of the usual hadrons .",
    "we will know discuss scenarios beyond the standard higgs mechanism , where either there is no light higgs , or the higgs sector is more complicated than that in sm , so that the the @xmath0 scattering can become strong .",
    "as we have seen , absence of a light higgs boson leads to violation of unitarity .",
    "violation of unitarity may be prevented , or postponed to higher energy , in different ways , depending on the model .",
    "models can have extra fermions and extra gauge interactions , which give additional contributions to @xmath9 scattering , e.g. , resonances .",
    "an important consideration for many of the theories with a modified electroweak symmetry - breaking mechanism is conformity with precision tests .",
    "specifically , they can have an unacceptably large @xmath46 parameter of the oblique parameters @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 proposed by peskin and takeuchi @xcite , and a negative contribution to @xmath46 is needed to restore agreement with experiment .",
    "it is necessary to discriminate among mechanisms which give new effects in @xmath0 scattering . in particular ,",
    "their treatment would be different depending on whether the gauge interaction remains perturbative or not .",
    "one possibility is that of a heavy higgs , @xmath49 .",
    "in such a case , @xmath0 scattering would become large until the higgs pole is crossed .",
    "if the higgs mass is above the unitarity limit , the gauge - boson interaction becomes non - perturbative .",
    "this needs special non - perturbative treatment of gauge - boson interactions , and it is possible that the strong interaction produces resonances which would be seen .",
    "the second possibility is that there is no higgs boson , and the symmetry is broken dynamically .",
    "in such a case there is a new sector with strong interactions , and this could produce its own resonances .",
    "a third possibility is that there is a light higgs in an extension of the standard model .",
    "then again two cases arise : one where there are other higgs bosons , and the dynamics still remains perturbative for @xmath0 centre - of - mass energy beyond the light higgs resonance until the other higgs resonances are crossed , or could become strong if the remaining higgs bosons are heavy .",
    "these possibilities are discussed in the context of two - higgs doublet models in @xcite .",
    "the other case is when the light higgs is light because it is a pseudo - goldstone boson of a higher global symmetry , broken by the sm interactions @xcite . in either case ,",
    "@xmath0 scattering would be interesting to study in spite of a light higgs boson .",
    "we discuss a few of these models below .",
    "however , we begin with a model - independent approach .      in view of the variety of models",
    ", it would be preferable to have a unified , model - independent description of @xmath9 scattering .",
    "effective lagrangians may be used to provide such a description , valid up to a certain cut - off @xmath50 .",
    "a no - resonance scenario is described in an electroweak chiral lagrangian ( ewcl ) model , where one writes effective bosonic operators @xcite in a series of increasing dimensions .",
    "the coefficients will have inverse powers of @xmath50 .",
    "the effective lagrangian is a low - energy expansion , and at the lowest non - trivial order , corresponding to operators of the lowest dimension , the scattering amplitudes for longitudinal gauge bosons , on using the equivalence theorem , would satisfy the low - energy theorems .",
    "however , coefficients of the higher - dimensional operators have to be fixed either on the basis of some underlying theory , or , in a purely phenomenological approach , from experiment .",
    "since the chiral lagrangian is valid at low energies , an extrapolation to higher energies would lead to violation of unitarity .",
    "unitarization can be built in in a somewhat _ ad hoc _ fashion by the use of pad ' e approximants , also known as the inverse amplitude method ( iam ) , or the k - matrix method and this can generate a resonant behaviour @xcite . the @xmath51 method , developed for strong interactions @xcite , has also been applied for unitarization of electroweak amplitudes @xcite .",
    "terms in the chiral lagrangian must respect @xmath52 gauge symmetry , which is broken spontaneously .",
    "experimental constraints require that the higgs sector also approximately respect a larger @xmath53 symmetry , where the second factor @xmath54 corresponds to the so - called custodial symmetry .",

    "however , if the mvb s are far above 1 tev in mass , @xmath9 scattering will be strong @xcite .",
    "we now look at the practical aspects of actual observation of @xmath0 scattering at the lhc .",

    "in fact , as we shall see , the interference between these two classes of diagrams is large , and huge cancellations can take place . moreover , the gauge bosons taking part in the scattering are necessarily virtual ( in fact , space - like ) .",
    "thus the formalism has to take into account the virtuality of the gauge bosons .",
    "a standard approach in the past to processes involving gauge bosons has been the equivalent vector - boson approximation , an extension of the equivalent - photon approximation used since early times @xcite .",
    "the equivalent - photon approximation ( weizs \" acker - williams approximation ) relates the cross section for a charged particle beam to interact with a target with a virtual photon exchange to the cross section for real photon beam to interact with the same target and produce the final state : = dx _ ( x ) f_e/(x ) . here",
    ", the photon distribution with momentum fraction @xmath119 in a charged - particle beam of energy @xmath120 is given by f_e/(x ) = ( ) [ x + ( 1-x)^2 ] .",
    "this is generalized to what is known as an equivalent ( or effective ) vector - boson approximation ( evba ) for a process with weak bosons in place of photons @xcite .",
    "the corresponding distributions of vector bosons @xmath121 in a fermion @xmath122 are given by @xcite    lcl f_f / v_(x ) & = & ( ) + & & + f_f / v_l(x ) & = & ( 1-x ) .    here",
    "the suffixes @xmath123 on @xmath121 denote the helicities @xmath124 of @xmath121 and @xmath125 is the state with helicity 0 .",
    "the use of evba entails ( a ) restricting to vector boson scattering diagrams ( b ) neglecting diagrams of bremsstrahlung type ( c ) putting on - shell momenta of the vector bosons which take part in the scattering and ( d ) approximating the total cross section of the process @xmath126 by the convolution of the vector boson luminosities @xmath127 with the on - shell cross section :    ll ( f_1f_2f_3f_4v_3v_4)&= dx_v_1,v_2_s_1s_2 ^v_1v_2_s_1s_2(x ) + & ^on_s_1s_2(v_1v_2v_3v_4 , xs_qq )    here @xmath128 , while @xmath129 is the vector boson pair invariant mass and @xmath130 is the square of the partonic c.m . energy , and",
    "@xmath131 are the spins of @xmath132 .",
    "note in the context of ( c ) above that the on - shell point @xmath133 is outside the physical region @xmath134 .",
    "thus the extrapolation involved is more than that involved in the case of the equivalent - photon approximation .",
    "even if only the longitudinal polarization , expected to be dominant , is kept , evba overestimates the true cross section .",
    "the transverse polarization contribution is found to be comparable to the longitudinal one @xcite .",
    "improved evba @xcite , going beyond the leading approximation , still overestimates the cross section @xcite .",
    "further improvements in evba have been attempted @xcite .",
    "backgrounds are of two types :    \\1 . bremsstrahlung processes  these are processes where the vector bosons are radiated by quark or anti - quark partons , and which do not contribute to @xmath135 scattering .",
    "\\2 . processes which fake a @xmath135 final state .",
    "it is important to understand the first inherent background , and device cuts which may enhance the signal .",

    "one simply makes predictions for the combined process of @xmath136 .",
    "the second background is crucial to take care of , otherwise we do not know if we are seeing a @xmath135 pair in the final state or not .",
    "background processes are @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 + jet , with top decays giving @xmath140 pair .",
    "electroweak - qcd process @xmath141 + jets can mimic the signal when the invariant mass of the two jets is around @xmath142",
    ". there is a potential background from qcd processes @xmath143 and ( @xmath139 + jets ) , in which a @xmath1 can come from the decay of @xmath144 or @xmath145 .",
    "@xmath1 boson pairs produced from the intrinsic electroweak process @xmath146 tend to be transversely polarized .",
    "coupling to @xmath141 of incoming quark is purely left - handed .",
    "helicity conservation implies that outgoing quark follows the direction of incoming quark for longitudinal @xmath1 , and it goes opposite to direction of incoming quark for transverse ( left - handed ) @xmath1 .",
    "hence outgoing quark jet is less forward in background than in signal event , and tagging of the forward jet can help .",
    "in addition , emission in the central region is favoured in the qcd background processes , whereas jet production in the central region is suppressed for @xmath0 scattering .",
    "thus , a veto on additional jets in the central region would be a powerful discriminant between signal an background .",
    "for a discussion of the @xmath0 scattering in the context of lhc detectors , see @xcite .",
    "the feasibility of extracting @xmath0 scattering from experiment and comparison of evba with exact results was recently studied by accomando and collaborators @xcite .",
    "it is known that when @xmath1 s are allowed to be off mass shell , the amplitude grows faster with energy , as compared to when they are on shell @xcite .",

    "their results show that @xmath0 scattering diagrams do not constitute the dominant contribution in any gauge or phase space region .",
