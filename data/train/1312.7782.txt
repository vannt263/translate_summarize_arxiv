    "topological phases of matter are characterised by global entanglement and correlations . due to their non - local nature , topologically ordered phases are robust to local perturbations and have therefore received wide attention in the context of error - free quantum computation and quantum information processing .    although a full classification of topological phases is far from being achieved , very important steps have been given in this direction , in particular in the context of gapped non - interacting systems where a complete classification has been put forward @xcite . for those , the characterisation and detection of topological phases may be achieved by certain topological invariants associated with the filled energy bands . in the case of certain insulator classes such invariants can be associated with direct physical response functions such as a quantised hall conductivity .",
    "a manifestation of topologically ordered phases is the appearance of gapless symmetry - protected edge modes at the interface between topologically distinct phases .    on the experimental side",
    "an increasing activity has been seen in the search for new the topological insulators and topological superconductor materials .",
    "various experimental signatures have been proposed and considerable experimental evidence has by now been found@xcite .",
    "the absence of a local order parameter and the impossibility to use landau symmetry breaking arguments turn topological phases into one of the most successful examples where entanglement measures , such as the entanglement entropy , bring new insights that could be hardly achieved by other more traditional methods .",
    "the use of quantum information concepts in condensed matter physics has already been extensively considered with entanglement measures being used to probe properties of many body states @xcite and to detect quantum phase transition @xcite .",
    "kosterlitz - thouless transitions , laking a local order parameter , were successfully detected calculating the fidelity susceptibility of the @xmath0 spin chain @xcite .",
    "many other systems were also studied such as the one - dimensional hubbard model @xcite , spin-@xmath1 particles on a torus @xcite , the toric code model and the quantum eight - vertex model @xcite , the spin honeycomb kitaev model @xcite , as well as other spin systems @xcite .    in the thermodynamic limit , the ground state of a local hamiltonian having a finite energy gap",
    "is characterised by short range correlations of local observables . for such systems , the ground state entanglement entropy of a subsystem @xmath2 : @xmath3 ( with @xmath4 the reduced density matrix of the subsystem ) follows the so - called area law ,",
    "i.e. it is proportional to the size of the boundary of @xmath2 in the limit of asymptotically large systems .",
    "nonetheless sub - leading corrections are expected .",
    "for a two dimensional system with perimeter @xmath5 the area law @xcite translates to : @xmath6 here @xmath7 is a non - universal constant term , @xmath8 contains the non - extensive contributions and @xmath9 denote other contributions that vanish as @xmath10 . in a gapped system , where correlations are short ranged ,",
    "it is expected that the entanglement entropy between two regions should follow the area law ( the boundary between the two sub regions ) ; if a phase has topological order , where some long range entanglement is expected , then there should be an entropy reduction with respect to the area law of a non - topological gapped system .",
    "the non - extensive corrections have been shown to encode subtle effects due to the presence or absence of topological and/or long range order .",
    "some contributions to @xmath8 are universal , in the sense that they are robust to transformations that do not close the gap , and , in some cases , can be assigned to a given phase of mater . however",
    ", this information can be masked by non - universal terms dependent on the particular geometry of @xmath2 .",
    "a prescription to extract the topological content of the entanglement entropy was given by kitaev and preskil @xcite and levin and wen @xcite .",
    "in their proposals they engineer particular ways to extract a universal topological contribution , here denoted as @xmath11 , from the non - extensive terms .",
    "this quantity , dubbed topological entanglement entropy ( tee ) , has been proposed to characterise certain topological phases in relation to the quantum dimension @xmath12 of the system : @xmath13 @xcite . since then , @xmath11 has been used as a signature of topological order in several systems as , for instance , in frustrated quantum dimer models and in the kitaev honeycomb model @xcite , as well as applied to detect topological order in spin liquid states @xcite .",
    "a rich set of different behaviours have been found , in particular for gapped systems that spontaneously break a discrete symmetry where the correction to the area law has been observed to receive other contributions that may add up to the topological ones .",
    "this corrections are negative and are given by the logarithm of the number of degenerate groundstates @xcite .",
    "for systems with gapped quasiparticle - like excitations but with gapless collective modes resulting from a spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry there are also negative corrections that diverge logarithmically as the system size grows @xcite .    for systems described by an hamiltonian that is quadratic in the electronic operators , such as topological insulators or superconductors ( with an externally fixed superconducting phase ) , @xmath14 vanishes .",
    "therefore , even for systems that can not be adiabatically connected to trivial band insulators , there is no topological order in the sense of ref . .",

    "a related but somehow different observation has been made by hughes et al for the single - particle entanglement spectrum of chern and spin hall insulators . in their work",
    "the authors report that , for a trivial insulator with edge modes , even if the entanglement spectrum is gapless the bands that cross zero are disconnected from the rest of the spectrum .",
    "in this work we have analysed the entanglement entropy of a two - dimensional topological p - wave superconductor .",
    "we have studied separately contributions to the entanglement entropy that are both extensive and non - extensive with the perimeter of the subsystem .",
    "the main conclusions of our work are the following :    \\i ) the entanglement entropy clearly signals the topological transitions as its derivatives have sharp features around the transition lines , even for small systems sizes",
    ". moreover , for our model , the derivative of the entanglement entropy with respect to the zeeman term shows approximate plateaus that provide a sensible signature of each topological phase .",
    "\\ii ) due to the gapped nature of the spectrum away from the transitions between the various topological phases , the entropy obeys an area law with a non - universal pre - factor that depends on the parameters of the hamiltonian but also on the specificities of the boundary of the subsystem .",
    "we find that boundary contributions coming from different kinds of boundaries simply add on .",
    "having a way to estimate @xmath7 based on the characteristic lengths of the problem would be insightful , however in this study we found no clear relation of @xmath7 with the characteristic decay length of various correlation functions .",

    "we found that corners with smaller angles give a larger contribution to the entanglement entropy .",
    "our findings suggests that a systematic study of the dependence of corner contributions as a function of its angle could be an interesting avenue to further investigations .",
    "\\iv ) even if the topological entanglement entropy vanishes inside each topological phase , finite size effects are considerable and are quite severe in the proximity of transition lines , at least for the finite systems considered here .",
    "our work suggests that an alternative way to find @xmath11 is to study the relation between non - extensive corrections of different geometries as a parameter of the hamiltonian is changed within the same topological phase .",
    "for example for systems with non - vanishing @xmath11 the generic relation of @xmath138 and @xmath136 is @xmath182 .",
    "fitting such relation yields a better estimation for the tee .",
    "\\v ) in a cylinder geometry the topological contribution to the entanglement entropy is finite and is in general negative .",
    "the reason is associated with a robust negative contribution due to the gapless edge states each contributing @xmath183 to the entropy , characteristic of majorana edge states .",
