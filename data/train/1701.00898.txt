    "networks carry enormous amount of information . failure of any element in an optical network even for a small duration can lead to large amount of information and revenue loss .",
    "thus , it is important to build mechanism of survivability to take care of such failures .",
    "survivability of a network is the ability of network to either maintain uninterrupted flow of information or minimize the outage period . in optical network",
    ", it is of great importance and therefore , it has been studied extensively by the researchers @xcite @xcite .",
    "+ among various protection schemes , p - cycles are promising due to mesh like efficiency and ring like speed .",
    "p - cycle was first introduced by grover @xcite and since then it is a subject of great interest in the area of optical network survivability @xcite .",
    "p - cycle can protect working capacity of on - cycle as well as straddling links .",
    "a straddling link is a chord of cycle with their nodes on cycle . when a straddling link fails p - cycle has two paths to reroute the traffic and hence , the capacity requirement in p - cycle is reduced to half of working capacity protected in the straddling links .",
    "a single copy of p - cycle can provide unit capacity protection to on - cycle links and , two unit capacity protection to straddling links on it .",
    "normally a copy of p - cycle can protect unit capacity on on - cycle link and two units of capacity on a straddling link .",
    "a straddling link has two alternative paths on p - cycle for restoration , and this attribute of p - cycle is employed in the proposed method to protect optical network against two simultaneous link failure . in the proposed protection method ,",
    "all the links having working capacities are protected only as straddling links and on - cycle protection is not used . in case , a p - cycle is shared among multiple straddling links , the number of copies of p - cycles are taken to be equal to the highest capacity straddling link .",
    "number of copies of p - cycles to protect a straddling link is kept equal to the capacity of straddling link .",
    "if the capacity of the straddling link to be protected is an odd number , then the number of copies of p - cycle is kept unit capacity higher than the capacity of the straddling link .",
    "even number of copies of p - cycle are required to ensure protection where the capacity of straddling links sharing the p - cycle are equal and odd number .",
    "for example , if capacity of each straddling links to be protected is three , then the copies of p - cycle should be four .",
    "restoration takes place in two different ways depending on which two links have failed ( two straddling links , or a straddling and an on - cycle link ) . when two straddling links fail simultaneously , highest capacity straddling link uses half of the capacity of p - cycle , and the other failed link uses the remaining capacity of the p - cycle .",
    "when a straddling link and an on - cycle link fail then the straddling link uses the intact alternative path on p - cycle for restoration . consider a p - cycle protecting three straddling links @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 as shown in fig .",
