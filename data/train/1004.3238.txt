    "the localization of quantum particles by a static random potential , or of classical waves by random fluctuations of the medium , is one of the most intriguing phenomena in statistical physics .",
    "the key ingredient of localization , wave interference , was introduced in p. w. anderson s seminal paper `` absence of diffusion in certain random lattices '' .",
    "@xcite there it was shown that electrons may be localized by a random potential , so that diffusion is suppressed , even in a situation where classical particles would be delocalized .",
    "the fundamental reason for the localizing effect of a random potential on quantum particles or classical waves is the multiple interference of wave components scattered by randomly positioned scattering centers .",
    "the interference effect takes place , as long as the propagation is coherent .",
    "it is interesting to note that the first application of the idea of localization concerned the spin diffusion @xmath0 of electrons and not the electrical conductivity @xmath1 .",
    "anderson considered a tight - binding model of electrons on a crystal lattice , with energy levels at each site chosen from a random distribution .",
    "@xcite the traditional view had been , that scattering by the random potential causes the bloch waves to lose well - defined momentum on the length scale of the mean - free path @xmath2 .",
    "nevertheless , the wavefunction was thought to remain extended throughout the sample .",
    "anderson pointed out that if the disorder is sufficiently strong , the particles may become localized , in that the envelope of the wave function @xmath3 decays exponentially from some point @xmath4 in space : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the localization length .",
    "there exist a number of review articles on the anderson localization problem .",
    "the most complete account of the early work was presented by lee and ramakrishnan  @xcite .",
    "the seminal early work on interaction affects is presented in ref .",
    "a complete account of the early numerical work can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . a path integral formulation of weak localization is presented in ref .",
    "several more review articles and books are cited along the way . in the following",
    "we will use units with planck s constant @xmath7 and boltzmann s constant @xmath8equal to unity , unless stated otherwise .",
    "the wavefunction @xmath3 of a single electron of mass @xmath9 in a random potential @xmath10 obeys the stationary schrdinger equation @xmath11 in the simplest case @xmath10 may be assumed to obey gaussian statistics with @xmath12 , but many of the results presented below are valid for a much wider class of models .",
    "electrons propagating in the random potential @xmath10 will be scattered on average after a time @xmath13 . for weak random potential",
    "the scattering rate is given by @xmath14where @xmath15 is the density of states at the energy @xmath16 of the electron . in a metal",
    "the electrons carrying the charge current are those at the fermi energy @xmath17 . within the time @xmath18 the electron travels a distance @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is its velocity .    in close analogy",
    "the wave amplitude @xmath3 of a classical monochromatic wave of frequency @xmath21 obeys the wave equation @xmath22here @xmath23 is the wave velocity at position @xmath24 in an inhomogeneous medium , assumed to be a randomly fluctuating quantity .",
    "the main difference between the schrdinger equation and the wave equation is that in the wave equation the random potential  @xmath25 is multiplied by @xmath26 , so that disorder is suppressed in the limit @xmath27 . by contrast , in the quantum case disorder will be dominant in the limit of low energy @xmath16 . a further difference may arise if the wave amplitude is a vector quantity as , e.g. , in the  case of electromagnetic waves in @xmath28 dimensions .    in real systems particles or wave packets",
    "are not independent , but interact .",
    "electrons are coupled by the coulomb interaction , leading to important effects that go much beyond the single particle model .",
    "similarly , wave packets interact via nonlinear polarization of the medium .",
    "apart from these complications , the physics of electronic wave packets and classical wave packets is quite similar . in the following",
    "we will present most of the discussion in the language of electronic wave packets .",
    "the all - important effect of wave interference is most clearly seen in the limit of weak scattering , where it already may cause localization , but only in reduced dimensions .",
    "while it is difficult to observe full localization at finite temperature @xmath29 , on account of the effect of interactions limiting the phase coherence , the dramatic signatures of localization are visible at finite @xmath29 in the form of `` weak localization''.@xcite    an electron or a wave packet moving through a disordered medium will be scattered by the random potential on the average after propagating a distance @xmath2 , the mean - free path . on larger",
    "length scales the propagation is diffusive .",
    "weak localization is a consequence of destructive interference of two wave components starting at some point and returning to the same point after traversing time - reversed paths .",
    "let the probability amplitudes for the wave packet to move from point @xmath4 along some path @xmath30 back to @xmath4 be @xmath31 and along a different path @xmath32 be @xmath33 , then the transition probability for the particle to move either along @xmath30 or along @xmath32 will be @xmath34where @xmath35 and @xmath36 . for",
    "any two paths the interference term @xmath37 may be positive or negative , and thus averages to zero .",
    "however , if @xmath38 is the amplitude of the time - reverse of path @xmath39 and if time reversal holds , then @xmath40 , i.e. , the probability of return @xmath41 is enhanced by a factor of two compared to the probability @xmath42 of a classical system : @xmath43 in that case the probability for transmission is reduced , which leads to a reduced diffusion coefficient and a reduced conductivity .",
    "one may estimate the correction to the conductivity in the following qualitative way .",
    "the relative change of the conductivity @xmath1 by the above interference effect is equal to the probability of interference of two wave packets of extension @xmath44 , the wavelength , after returning to the starting point .",
    "the infinitesimal probability of return to the origin in time @xmath45 of a particle diffusing in @xmath46 dimension is given by @xmath47 where @xmath0 is the diffusion coefficient .",
    "since the volume of interference in the time interval @xmath48 $ ] is @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the velocity of the wave packet , one finds the quantum correction to the conductivity @xmath51 as  @xcite @xmath52here @xmath53 is the diffusion constant , @xmath54 is the mean - free path , @xmath55 is the mean time between successive elastic collisions , @xmath56 is the drude conductivity with @xmath57 as the particle density , and @xmath58 are constants of order unity",
    ". the upper limit of the integral is the phase relaxation time @xmath59 , i.e. , the average time after which phase coherence is lost due to inelastic or other phase - shifting processes . for weak",
    "localization processes to exist at all , the inequality @xmath60 must hold . we note that the correction in three and two dimensions depends on the ratio of wavelength @xmath44 to mean - free path @xmath2 , and gets smaller in the limit of weak disorder , where @xmath61 . in two and one",
    "dimension the correction grows large in the limit @xmath62 since one expects the phase relaxation rate @xmath63 for a system in thermodynamic equilibrium to go to zero for @xmath64 .",
    "by contrast , in some cases a plateau behavior of @xmath63 as a function of temperature has been found experimentally , which gave rise to the speculation that the zero point fluctuations may cause decoherence .",
    "however , given a unique ground state , it is difficult to understand how a particle in the system may loose its phase coherence .",
    "several physical mechanisms that may lead to a plateau of @xmath63 have been identified .",
    "for a recent discussion of these issues see ref.@xcite",
    ". with @xmath62 for @xmath64 the weak localization quantum correction will be large in any system in @xmath65 , no matter how weak the disorder . as we will see , this behavior signals the fact that there are no extended states in @xmath66 dimensions .",
    "the characteristic length @xmath67 over which a wave packet retains phase coherence is related to @xmath59 by the diffusion coefficient @xmath68 . in systems of restricted dimension , e.g. , films of thickness @xmath69 or wires of diameter @xmath69 , the effective dimensionality of the system with respect to localization is determined by the ratio @xmath70 .",
    "namely , for @xmath71 the system is three - dimensional ( 3@xmath46 ) , while for @xmath72 diffusion over time @xmath59 takes place in the restricted geometry of the film or wire , and the effective dimension is therefore @xmath73 or @xmath74 .",
    "the appearance of localized states is easily understood in the limit of very strong disorder : localized orbitals will then exist at positions where the random potential forms a deep well .",
    "the admixture of adjacent orbitals by the hopping amplitudes will only cause a perturbation that does not delocalize the particle .",
    "the reason for this is that nearby orbitals will have sufficiently different energies so that the amount of admixture is small . on the other hand ,",
    "orbitals close in energy will in general be spatially far apart , so that their overlap is exponentially small .",
    "thus , we can expect the wave functions in strongly disordered systems to be exponentially localized . whether the particles become delocalized when the disorder strength is reduced ,",
    "is a much more complex question . in one dimension",
    "it can be shown rigorously that all states are localized , no matter how weak the disorder  @xcite .    in three dimensions ,",
    "the accepted view is that the particles are delocalized for weak disorder . in general ,",
    "localized and extended states of the same energy do not coexist , since in a typical situation any small perturbation would lead to hybridization and thus to the delocalization of a localized state .",
    "we can therefore assume that the localized and extended states of a given energy are separated .",
    "for increasing disorder strength @xmath75 there will then be a sharp transition from delocalized to localized states at a critical disorder strength @xmath76 .",
    "a qualitative criterion as to when an anderson transition is expected in @xmath77-systems has been proposed by ioffe and regel @xcite .",
    "it states that as the mean free path @xmath2becomes shorter with increasing disorder , the anderson transition occurs when @xmath2 is of the order of the wavelength @xmath44 of the particle ( which amounts to the condition @xmath78 in metals , where @xmath79 is the fermi wave number ) . as we will see later , in @xmath80 or @xmath81 systems",
    "@xmath2 may be much longer than the wavelength and the particles are nonetheless localized .",
    "in fact , the relevant mean free path here is the one with respect to momentum transfer .",
    "a similar situation exists when we fix the disorder strength , but vary the energy @xmath16 .",
    "electrons in states near the bottom of the energy band are expected to be localized even by a weakly disordered potential , whereas electrons in states near the band center ( in @xmath28 ) will be delocalized , provided the disorder is not too strong . thus there exists a critical energy @xmath82 separating localized from delocalized states , the so - called mobility edge  @xcite .",
    "the electron mobility as a function of energy is identically zero on the localized side ( at zero temperature ) , and increases continuously with energy separation @xmath83 in the delocalized , or metallic , phase .",
    "the continuous character of this quantum phase transition , termed _",
    "anderson transition _ , is a consequence of the scaling theory to be presented below .",
    "historically the continuous nature of the metal - insulator transition in disordered solids has been a point of controversy for many years . according to an earlier theory by mott  @xcite the conductivity changes discontinuously at the transition , such that a `` minimum metallic conductivity '' exists on the metallic side of the transition .",
    "numerical simulations@xcite have shown beyond doubt that the transition is instead continuous , at least in the absence of interactions .    in the much more complex situation of interacting electrons",
    "one finds for the hubbard model without disorder , using the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) , that the mott - hubbard metal - insulator transition is discontinuous at finite temperatures , and that it becomes continuous in the limit @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "for the hubbard model in the presence of disorder ( `` anderson - hubbard model '' ) at @xmath85 the situation is similar : the mott - hubbard metal - insulator transition is discontinuous for finite disorder and becomes continuous in the limit of vanishing disorder @xcite .",
    "the anderson localization transition is a quantum phase transition , i.e. , it is a transition at zero temperature tuned by a control parameter , e.g. , the disorder strength , particle energy , or wave frequency . unlike other quantum phase transitions , the anderson transition does not have an obvious order parameter .",
    "nonetheless , there exists a dynamically generated length scale , the localization or correlation length @xmath6 , which tends to infinity as the transition is approached .",
    "therefore , by drawing an analogy with magnetic phase transitions , wegner early on proposed scaling properties @xcite .",
    "later , he formulated a field - theoretic description of the anderson transition in the form of a non - linear sigma model ( nl@xmath1 m ) of interacting matrices ( rather than vectors , as for magnetic systems ) @xcite .",
    "the nl@xmath1 m was later formulated in the mathematically more tractable supersymmetric form@xcite .",
    "wegner  @xcite argued that the anderson localization transition should be described in the language of critical phenomena of continuous ( quantum ) phase transitions .",
    "this requires the assumption of a correlation length @xmath86 diverging as a function of disorder strength @xmath75 at the critical point @xmath87the conductivity is then expected to obey the scaling law @xmath88this follows from the fact that @xmath1 , written in units of @xmath89 , has dimension ( 1/length)@xmath90 , and the only characteristic length near the transition is the correlation length @xmath6 . by comparing the conductivity exponent @xmath91 with the exponent of @xmath6 one finds @xmath92on the other hand , the conductance @xmath93 of a d - dimensional cube of length @xmath94 , which for a good metal of conductivity @xmath1 is given by @xmath95 , must obey the scaling property @xmath96this means that @xmath93 is a function of a single parameter @xmath97 , so that each value of @xmath97 corresponds to a value @xmath93 .",
    "it then follows that @xmath98 obeys the renormalization group ( rg ) equation @xmath99where @xmath100 is a function of @xmath93 only , and does not depend on disorder . in a landmark paper , abrahams ,",
    "anderson , licciardello and ramakrishnan  @xcite proposed the above equation and calculated the @xmath101-function in the limits of weak and strong disorder .",
    "a confirmation of the assumption of scaling was obtained from a calculation of the next - order term  @xcite .    at strong disorder one",
    "expects all states to be localized , with average localization length @xmath6 .",
    "it then follows that @xmath98 is an exponentially decreasing function of @xmath94 : @xmath102 in comparison with the ohmic dependence @xmath103 this is a very non - ohmic behavior .",
    "the @xmath101-function is then given by @xmath104at weak disorder one finds from @xmath103 that @xmath105the important question of whether the system is delocalized ( metal ) or localized ( insulator ) may be answered by integrating the rg equation from some starting point @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is known . depending on whether @xmath100 is positive or negative along the integration path",
    ", the conductance will scale to infinity or to zero , as @xmath94 goes to infinity .",
    "in @xmath28 dimensions one has @xmath108 at large @xmath93 , but @xmath109 at small @xmath93 .",
    "thus , there exists a critical point at @xmath110 , where @xmath111 , separating localized and delocalized behavior .    on the other hand , in @xmath112 dimension one",
    "has @xmath109 at large and small @xmath93 , and by interpolation also for intermediate values of @xmath93 , so that there is no transition in this case and all states are localized .",
    "the dimension @xmath113 apparently plays a special role , as in this case @xmath114 for @xmath115 . in order to determine whether @xmath116 or @xmath117 for large @xmath93 one has to calculate the scale dependent ( i.e. , @xmath94-dependent ) corrections to the drude result at large @xmath93 .",
    "this is precisely the weak localization correction already mentioned above . for a system of finite length @xmath118 we should replace @xmath119 in eq .",
    "by @xmath120 , leading to @xmath121where a diagrammatic calculation  @xcite gives @xmath122 and @xmath123 ( in units of @xmath124 ; @xmath125 is the fermi wave length ) has been used .",
    "it follows that @xmath126so that we can expect @xmath127 for all @xmath93 , implying that again all states are localized .",
    "this result is valid for the usual  type of disorder , i.e. , in case all symmetries , in particular time reversal symmetry ( required for the weak localization correction to be present ) are preserved .",
    "if time - reversal invariance is broken , e.g. , by spin - flip scattering at magnetic impurities , the weak localization effect is somewhat reduced in dimensions @xmath128 , @xmath129 , but is not completely removed .",
    "the first correction term in the @xmath101-function is then proportional to @xmath130 ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) implying that all states are still localized ( in @xmath28 dimensions the leading correction term is again @xmath131 ; see ref.@xcite ) . in the presence of a magnetic field",
    "the situation is more complex , since the scaling of the hall conductance is coupled to the scaling of @xmath93 . as a result ,",
    "one finds exactly one extended state per landau energy level , which then gives rise to the quantum hall effect  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if spin - rotation invariance is broken , but time - reversal invariance is preserved , as is the case of spin - orbit scattering , the correction term is proportional to @xmath132 , i.e. , it is _ anti - localizing_. in this case the @xmath101-function in @xmath113 dimensions has a zero , implying the existence of an anderson transition  @xcite .      in the neighborhood of the critical point at @xmath133 in @xmath28",

    "there exist , however , reliable results on @xmath146 from numerical studies , according to which @xmath153 @xcite .      the dynamical conductivity @xmath154 , i.e. , the a.c . conductivity at frequency @xmath21 , in the thermodynamic limit in @xmath28 obeys the scaling law @xcite @xmath155where the scaling function @xmath156 has been introduced in eq .  .",
    "here @xmath157 is the typical length which a wave packet travels in the time of one cycle , @xmath158 . since the motion is diffusive it obeys @xmath159 .",
    "it is important to note that the diffusion coefficient @xmath160 is energy scale dependent and is related to the conductivity via the einstein relation @xmath161where @xmath15 is the density of states at the particle energy @xmath16 .    at the anderson transition , where @xmath162 , we expect @xmath154 to be finite .",
    "it follows that @xmath163 and consequently @xmath164this is a self - consistent equation for @xmath154 , with solution @xmath165more precisely , in the above expressions @xmath21 should be replaced by the imaginary frequency @xmath166 , such that @xmath154 is a complex - valued quantity .    in a more general notation , introducing the dynamical critical exponent @xmath167 by @xmath168 , we conclude that @xmath169 .",
    "the dynamical scaling is valid in a wide neighborhood of the critical point , defined by @xmath170 , where @xmath171 .",
    "this scaling regime is accessible in experiment , not only by measuring the dynamical conductivity directly , but also by observing that at finite temperature the scaling in @xmath21 is cut off by the phase relaxation rate @xmath63  @xcite .",
    "therefore , assuming a single temperature power law @xmath172 , one finds the following scaling law for the temperature dependent d.c .",
    "conductivity @xmath173 using this scaling law one may in principle determine the critical exponent @xmath146 from the temperature dependence of the conductivity in the vicinity of the critical point . in the case of disordered metals or semiconductors , where studies of this type have been performed , the effect of electron - electron interaction has to be taken into account .",
    "one major modification in the above is that the einstein relation is changed .",
    "namely , the single - particle density of states ( which is not critical ) is replaced by the compressibility @xmath174 , with @xmath57 as the density and @xmath175 as the chemical potential , which in the presence of the long - range coulomb interaction is expected to vanish at the transition , i.e. , the system becomes incompressible .",
    "another change is that the frequency cutoff is given by the temperature .",
    "the critical exponents determined from experiment vary widely , from @xmath176 ( ref.@xcite ) and @xmath177 ( ref.@xcite ) to @xmath178 ( ref.@xcite ) , and from @xmath179 ( ref.@xcite ) to @xmath180 ( ref.@xcite ) .",

    "we briefly review the more recent developments , not yet described in our review@xcite .",
    "while initially the main interest had focussed on disordered electronic systems , in recent years the interest shifted to localization of classical waves and even more recently , to ultracold atom systems .",
    "we first review an extension of the self - consistent theory to the case of weak applied magnetic and electric fields .",
    "one of the limitations of the self - consistent theory has been the difficulty to treat scale dependent contributions to the conductivity in the presence of a magnetic field in perturbation theory .",
    "as explained above , a magnetic field induces a mass  in the cooperon propagator and therefore removes the localizing interference effect leading to localization of all states in @xmath239 dimensions . on the other hand studies of the nonlinear @xmath1-model show that in higher ( two - loop ) order scale dependent terms appear which are generated solely by diffusion propagators ( diffusons ) .",
    "there is , however , a general theorem of perturbation theory , related to gauge invariance , stating that the singular contribution of any diagram with one diffuson and an arbitrary decoration with additional impurity lines cancels within a group of related diagrams@xcite .",
    "the way out of this apparent contradiction has only been found very recently @xcite .",
    "a satisfactory generalized self - consistent theory for the case of unitary symmetry , including the two - loop and higher contributions has not been formulated yet .",
    "nonetheless there is a parameter regime of weak magnetic field @xmath275 ( @xmath276 ) and moderately strong disorder , @xmath277 in which the one - loop contributions still dominate over the two - loop contributions and a generalized self - consistent theory may be formulated .",
    "the most complete discussion of this approach was given by bryksin and kleinert @xcite , who proposed a set of two coupled self - consistent equations for the diffusion coefficients @xmath278 in the particle - hole channel ( diffuson ) and @xmath279 in the particle - particle channel ( cooperon ) of a @xmath81 system :      here @xmath281 is the digamma function , @xmath282 is the coupling constant , @xmath283 is the magnetic length , and @xmath284 .",
    "the solution of these equations allows one to extend the results of weak localization theory , e.g. , for the negative magnetoresistance , to the regime of moderately strong disorder , leading to renormalized values of the parameters of weak localization theory .",
    "good agreement has been found with experimental data in that range.@xcite      an applied static electric field @xmath285 affects the localization physics in the following way : electrons drifting under the influence of @xmath285 experience a reduced probability of return , weakening the localization effect provided by interference of return paths .",
    "this effect is incorporated into the cooperon dynamics , leading to a new term in the diffusion pole @xmath286 where @xmath287 is the mobility .",

    "the behavior above threshold is logarithmic : @xmath290where @xmath291 .",
    "the relaxation of the charge current following a sudden switch on of the electric field has been considered in ref.@xcite .",
    "there it was found that the current has a long time tail @xmath292 as a consequence of the infrared singular behavior of the cooperon pole .",
    "the question of how the scaling properties of the conductance are modified in anisotropic systems was first addressed in ref .",
    "there it was established that even in the presence of an anisotropic electronic band structure and an anisotropic impurity - scattering cross section the one - parameter scaling theory holds .",
    "the ratios of the components of the conductivity tensor are invariant under scaling , implying that the geometric mean of the conductivity components plays the role of the scaling quantity .",
    "this feature is preserved by the self - consistent theory .",
    "numerical studies of anisotropic systems @xcite appeared to cast doubts on the one - parameter scaling hypothesis .",
    "however , a later more careful study of the problem in @xmath113 dimensions showed that indeed one - parameter scaling is obeyed @xcite : the ratio of the localization lengths ( in the direction of the principal axes ) turns out to be proportional to the square root of the ratio of the conductivities .",
    "a comparison with the self - consistent theory in the somewhat simpler form of the `` potential - well analogy '' @xcite showed again qualitative agreement . localization in anisotropic systems has also been considered in a model with anisotropic random potential correlations , and the phase diagram has been mapped out within an extension of the self - consistent theory @xcite .",
    "the same authors explored the consequences of finite - range correlations of the random potential within a generalization of the self - consistent theory.@xcite    a somewhat different but related question is the behavior of the conductance of a film of finite thickness , or a wire of finite diameter .",
    "there is no doubt that in the thermodynamic limit these systems behave like true @xmath81 or @xmath80 systems .",
    "it is , however , interesting to understand how this behavior is approached .",
    "numerical studies of metallic disordered films as a function of film thickness seemed to indicate a localization transition as a function of thickness @xcite , in contradiction to the results of the self - consistent theory applied to this system . a further study by the same authors  @xcite on systems of finite thickness in a magnetic field explored the possibility of a delocalization transition controlled by both the thickness and the magnetic field .",
    "the transitions obtained are pseudo - transitions marking a crossover from strong to weak localization , as confirmed in a later more accurate numerical study @xcite .",
