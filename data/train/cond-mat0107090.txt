    "the macroscopic quantum tunneling , below the critical velocity , is studied within the collective coordinate approach and the semiclassical nucleation rate is obtained .",
    "the problem we consider is that of a two dimensional superflow past an impenetrable disk perpendicular to the @xmath0 axis . we will be interested in the process of removal of a preexistent quantum of vorticity inside the disk by the applied superflow ( along the @xmath1 direction ) . in three dimensions",
    "this would correspond to a straight vortex depinning from a columnar defect due to an applied superflow perpendicular to the column axis . in ref .",
    "@xcite this problem is studied considering that the vortex depins in the form of an arc attached to the column .",

    "it will prove convenient to express length in units of the coherence length @xmath6 , the condensate in units of @xmath7 and velocities in units of the speed of sound @xmath8 .",
    "we take as boundary conditions on @xmath5 :    [ bc1 ] ( , t ) e^i v_y  e^i , r ,    [ bc2 ] ( , t)= 0 , r a .",
    "the first and second exponentials in [ bc1 ] say that at infinity we have the external flow along the @xmath1 direction and the circulation due to a vortex somewhere near , or inside the disk .",
    "we assigned a radius @xmath9 to the disk and placed the origin at its center .",
    "the determination of the critical velocity for vortex depinning can be made by looking for steady state solutions of the nlse equation above . for @xmath10 below a certain critical value , dependent only on the disk radius , one is able to find stationary solutions representing a laminar flow . above the critical velocity",
    "no stationary state exists , a state with a circulation around the disk can evolve to produce a vortex near the edge of the disk .",
    "the nlse in @xmath11 was found to display the same type of behavior @xcite , phase slips are dynamically produced behind an inhomogeneity if a large enough flow velocity is applied at infinity .",

    "now we will follow ref . @xcite and study this problem using as a collective coordinate the 2@xmath12 location of the vortex in the flow region .",

    "one can view this equation as newton s equation for a massless object moving in a constant @xmath27-field along the @xmath0 direction plus an electrostatic potential set by @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( the applied flow plus the vortex images ) .",
    "alternatively , the @xmath30 and @xmath31 coordinates of the vortex can be thought of as conjugate variables with @xmath32 playing the role of the hamiltonian .",
    "the absence of a mass term is due to the incompressibility assumption , the effect of the compressibility is to introduce retardation effects in the response of the vortex to its external surroundings , which in turn gives rise to a frequency dependent mass term in the vortex equation of motion @xcite .",
    "the issue of the vortex mass in a neutral superfluid was , until recently , the subject of many papers @xcite .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the isolines of the hamiltonian function , which correspond to the trajectories followed by a positive vortex in the incompressible limit .",

    "[ fig1 ] describes the dynamics of a vortex that is already outside the disk , but we want to describe the process of vortex depinning whereby the quantum of circulation , initially inside the disk , is pushed outwards by the flow in the form of a vortex .",
    "the problem we face is characteristic of the collective coordinate approach since we are using as variable the very object whose creation we want to describe . one way out of this dilemma is to recognize that the incompressibility hypothesis should hold only at a distance @xmath33 away from the obstacle .",

    "[ fig3 ] below .",
    "if the parameter @xmath10 is such that the saddle point is inside this region dominated by the compressibility , one has the possibility of the nucleated vortex to appear in one of the open orbits to the right of the disk and be dragged along by the flow , as one observes in the simulation of the nlse .",
    "correspondingly , when the saddle point is outside the compressibility region any nucleated vortex would remain close to the disk , in one of the closed orbits .",
    "we would like to identify this situation with what happens when the velocity is below the critical velocity and the quantum of circulation remains trapped inside the disk .",
    "we therefore find an estimate for the critical velocity from :    _ ( x , y)=(a+,0 ) = 0 , and view @xmath34 as an adjustable parameter of order @xmath35 .",
    "we obtain : [ simple ] v_c = .",
    "an alternative expression for the critical velocity is that used in ref .",
    "one writes the nlse as two equations for @xmath14 and @xmath36 .",

    ", @xmath37 must be a constant .",
    "the asymptotic region fixes this value and one finds :    ( v_^2 - v^2 ) = - + -1 .",

    "if at some point @xmath41 a vortex will be nucleated so as to reduce the flow velocity at that point . we can estimate the highest velocity in the flow using the incompressible limit .",
    "if a quantum of circulation is present inside the disk , @xmath38 is maximum at the equator , and it is equal to @xmath42 .",
    "this gives the critical velocity as the maximum value of @xmath10 that ensures @xmath43 everywhere in the flow :    [ pomeau ] = .    in the limit",
    "@xmath44 one finds the critical velocity for vortex / antivortex pair nucleation , @xmath45 , quoted in ref .",

    "[ fig2 ] we show the dependence of @xmath46 on the disk radius from eqs .",
    "[ simple ] and [ pomeau ] . in the first case we used @xmath47 .",
    "to determine numerically the critical velocity for depinning we looked for the values of @xmath10 which allowed a steady state solution of eq .",
    "[ nlse ] . this solution , with the boundary condition of eq .",
    "[ bc1 ] at infinity , has @xmath48 as time dependence .",
    "the spatial dependence is then found as a solution of    [ nlse2 ] = -^2 + ( ||^2 -1 ) , with boundary conditions given by eqs .",
    "[ bc1 ] and [ bc2 ] .",
    "we wrote this equation using finite differences on a two dimensional grid and reduced the problem to a set of @xmath49 complex , nonlinear algebraic equations , for @xmath49 complex variables , the values of @xmath5 at the grid nodes .",
    "this was solved , starting from a trial state , using newton s method @xcite . the number of nodes varied depending on the disk radius so that we always had a minimum distance of @xmath50 between the disk boundary and the sides of the working area .",
    "the grid spacing used was 0.5@xmath35 , but it was reduced to 0.25@xmath35 for disks of smaller radii to ensure a reasonable representation of the disk as a region of the square grid .",
    "the disk radii ranged from 0.5@xmath35 to @xmath50 .",
    "after a solution with a given value of @xmath10 was found , a new @xmath10 , increased by 0.1 , was used in the boundary condition and in equation [ nlse2 ] .",
    "the code was run again taking the available solution as trial state . when newton s method failed to converge we took the last value of @xmath10 as a lower limit for the critical velocity .",
    "the critical velocities so obtained are shown in fig .",
    "there one sees an increase of @xmath46 with the disk radius , as both eqs .",
    "[ simple ] and [ pomeau ] predict , and an apparent saturation at the value 0.5@xmath51 , higher than the prediction of @xmath52 of eq .",
    "[ pomeau ] . the value of @xmath34 that must be used in eq .",
    "[ simple ] to obtain this asymptotic value of @xmath46 is @xmath53 .    above the critical velocity ,",
    "if one uses as initial state a condensate with a quantum of circulation inside the disk , one can observe the creation of a vortex from the dynamics of the nlse , eq .",
    "this equation was solved numerically using finite differences in a grid similar to the one described above .",
    "the condensate at time zero was evolved using a split - step algorithm @xcite where the laplacian part and the nonlinear part of the nlse were used alternately .",
    "the time step was 0.1@xmath54 .",
    "the condensate amplitude at four different times is shown in fig .",
    "there one observes the vortex formation in the region close to the disk equator and its subsequent movement downstream .",
    "after the vortex depinning , a vortex / antivortex pair is seen nucleating as in ref .",
    "this happens because the value of @xmath55 used is also above the critical velocity for pair nucleation for that particular radius , @xmath56 .",
    "below the critical velocity an effective barrier prevents the circulation around the disk to become a vortex outside the disk . at zero temperature",
    "this barrier can only be overcome via macroscopic quantum tunneling . in a thorough semiclassical treatment",
    "we would have to find the bounce in imaginary time that connects the condensate corresponding to the stationary , laminar flow , solution of the nlse at @xmath57 to a condensate containing a nucleated vortex near the disk at @xmath58 , and back to the stationary state at @xmath59 .",
    "this bounce would be a nontrivial solution of the imaginary time nlse @xcite :    @xmath60    here , @xmath61 is the stationary condensate that represents the laminar flow around the disk with the circulation trapped inside .",
    "the bounce solution would show , as imaginary time progresses , a vortex leaving the disk towards the flow and then returning back .",
    "the vortex position at @xmath58 would indicate the most favorable position inside the flow for the vortex to emerge .    instead of retaining all degrees of freedom of the condensate in the calculation of the bounce one can use the collective coordinate approach of section [ collective ] and",
    "focus on the dynamics of the vortex position . in this approach",
    "the bounce , or tunneling path , connects a closed orbit in the @xmath62 plane to its open counterpart having the same value of @xmath63 .",
    "this is done by allowing the momentum @xmath31 to become imaginary , see fig .",
    "the logarithm of the wkb tunneling rate is then proportional to the @xmath64 part of the action that governs the vortex dynamics , eq .",
    "[ eqmotion ] .",
    "this action in real time is :    s [ ] = h _ 0 ^2  dt .",
    "the semiclassical tunneling rate is then :    [ wkb ] _ wkb , with @xmath65 being the trajectory in the @xmath62 plane that is a solution ( with imaginary @xmath31 ) of :    [ trajec ] ( ) + g_i ( , ) = e.    the argument in the exponential is @xmath66 times the number of bosons enclosed by the imaginary momentum trajectory .",
    "to compare , in the field theory for the condensate we find the tunneling rate from :    _ wkb , where @xmath67 is the bounce solution of eqs .",
    "[ bounce ] and [ bounce2 ] .    whereas the semiclassical recipe for the tunneling of @xmath5 is well defined , in the collective coordinate treatment",
    "it is not clear between which pair of trajectories the tunneling will take place , or equivalently , which value of @xmath68 is to be used in eq .",
    "this ambiguity stems from the fact that the collective coordinate approach does not really describe the vortex nucleation process , instead it describes the tunneling of a preexisting vortex bound to the disk in a closed trajectory towards an open trajectory further inside the flow .",
    "one can imagine doing the same kind of approximation used to obtain the formula for the critical velocity and simply admit that the tunneling will occur between the closed trajectory that reaches a distance @xmath34 from the disk and its open counterpart .",
    "this would correspond to the vortex being produced at the furthest possible distance inside the compressibility dominated region around the disk .",
    "this fixes the value of @xmath68 to be used in eq .",
    "[ wkb ] and is consistent with the formula for the critical velocity , eq .",

    "we discussed the process of dynamical depinning , above the critical velocity , and the process of depinning via mqt , at zero temperature and below the critical velocity , with a collective coordinate approach .",
    "the problems inherent to this approach were circumvented with the introduction of a length @xmath34 ( @xmath75 ) proportional to the size of the compressibility dominated region around the defect .",
    "a more thorough calculation of the critical velocity was made using the full nlse and compared with the estimate based on the collective coordinate .",
    "the process of dynamical nucleation was demonstrated with a numerical simulation of the time dependent nlse .",
    "it is left for a future work to contrast the the semiclassical tunneling rate computed from eq .",
