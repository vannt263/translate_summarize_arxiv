    "fourier law of heat conduction has remained for two hundred years one of the most important topics in thermal physics .",
    "empiric results show accurate validation of fourier proposition . in the same time",
    ", relationship between equations of heat conduction and microstructure of solid dielectrics is known to be one of the oldest and most elusive unsolved problems in solid state physics , with considerable research efforts over last three decades @xcite-@xcite .",
    "significant step in the study of heat transport was carried out in seminal numerical experiment by fermi , pasta and ulam ( fpu ) in 1954 @xcite .",
    "the idea was to show that a simple one - dimensional system can acquire statistical - mechanical properties independently of the initial conditions .",
    "they presented the crystal as a one - dimensional chain of equal oscillators with nearest - neighbor interaction , with potential including quadratic as well as cubic and quartic terms .",
    "fpu assumed that the dynamic evolution will eventually lead to energy equipartition between all the linear modes of the system , as the thermal equilibrium is established .",
    "however , the system did not show the expected behavior .",
    "the energy was exchanged only among the lowest modes , and then restored to nearly initial configuration .",
    "the result disproved a common belief on inevitable fast thermalization and mixing in non - integrable systems with weak nonlinearity .",
    "the anomaly of thermalization , which was observed by fpu , is not unique to the system studied in their experiment .",
    "the most well - known examples of such anomalies are one - dimensional integrable systems , such as harmonic and toda lattices , in which the heat flux does not depend on the system size , but rather on the temperature difference .",
    "consequently , such systems have a divergent heat conductivity coefficient , as the length of the system increases @xcite .",
    "moreover , even linear temperature distribution is never established in these integrable systems .    over recent years , numerous additional anomalies in the heat transfer in microscopic models of dielectrics were revealed by means of direct numeric simulation , including qualitatively different behavior of models of different types ( with and without on - site potential ) @xcite .",
    "it is widely believed ( with some counter - examples discussed below ) that in one dimension the heat conduction coefficient in the microscopic models with conserved momentum diverges in the thermodynamic limit ( as the chain length @xmath0 goes to infinity ) as @xmath1 with @xmath2 varying in the interval @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "recent work on 1d chain of semi - elastic rods , as well as on more traditional models with lennard - jones and morse potential showed convergence of heat conductivity coefficient @xcite .",
    "divergent heat conduction of isolated low - dimensional systems can be explained by a weak scattering of long - wavelength phonons , which possess long mean free paths .",
    "then , it is possible to conjecture that finite conductivity has to be related to some well - defined mechanism , which enables efficient phonon scattering .",
    "so , convergence of the heat conduction coefficient in one - dimensional models was observed due to specific choice of boundaries @xcite , in the chain of coupled rotators @xcite , and recently in chains capable of dissociation @xcite . in this latter case",
    "the thermally activated `` gaps ''   in the chain ensure efficient phonon scattering , sufficient for the convergence of the heat conduction coefficient .",
    "two - dimensional system of anharmonically interacting oscillators with conserved momentum is also expected to have divergent heat conductivity . in particular , a logarithmic divergence of the conductivity with system size is predicted by mode coupling theory @xcite . the first numerical study on heat transport problem of two - dimensional lattice was presented in work of payton and visscher @xcite",
    ". dependence of the heat conductivity coefficient on the size of the system was considered in later work by jackson and mistriotis @xcite that conducted a comparison of 1d and 2d fpu lattices ; infinite conductivity has been observed .",
    "recent explorations of the 2d systems predict anomalous heat conduction , with either logarithmic ( see @xcite for fpu and lennard - jones lattice ) , or power - law ( see @xcite for fpu ) divergence of the heat conductivity coefficient .",
    "the three - dimensional case arises a lot of controversy @xcite .",
    "all studies mentioned above were aimed at exploration of lattices infinite in all directions ( within obvious numeric restrictions ) .",
    "different , and quite interesting , situation arises , when some dimensions exist in the model , but are externally confined .",
    "besides purely academic interest , such models might be useful for understanding the thermal behavior of nanosystems with large aspect ratio .",
    "we are going to concentrate on `` quasi - one - dimensional ''  models , in which only one dimension is spatially extended , and the thermodynamic limit is considered only in one direction .",
    "deutsch and narayan @xcite studied the thermal conductivity of such quasi-1d chains of hard spheres . in this model ,",
    "the spheres had an additional degree of freedom , but a modification of the initial order was not allowed .",
    "they found that the conductivity of a system of spheres with equal masses , and also with alternating masses , diverges with a size of the system .",
    "similar results were obtained by lipowski and lipowska @xcite , for quasi-1d models of hard disks that can and can not exchange their positions .",
    "anomalous heat conductivity was also seen in the recent work of morriss and truant @xcite on non - interacting hard disks in a channel .",
    "an interesting idea for simulating the finite conductivity was to introduce scatterers in quasi-1d billiard gas channels .",
    "the first work in this field was carried out by alonzo et al .",
    "@xcite , where a quasi-1d billiard in lorentz gas channel was analyzed .",
    "the ends of the channel were inserted into heat baths , and the movement of the particles inside the channel was interrupted by semicircular scatterers .",
    "the conductivity of such a chaotic system obeyed fourier s law . in order to investigate the role of chaos on the problem of heat conduction , following works implemented changes in geometry and order of the scatterers @xcite .",
    "some of the `` modified '' configurations showed normal heat conductivity . in some others ,",
    "the heat conduction coefficient diverged @xcite .",
    "thus the assumption that chaos may be sufficient condition for a system to possess the finite heat conductivity has been disproved .",
    "although such billiard gas models might shed some light on heat transfer , they lack particle interaction , phonon transport , and local thermal equilibrium , and can not represent the oscillatory lattice - like structure @xcite .",
    "previous studies considered models with only one possible mechanism of the heat transport : oscillatory waves in a system with fixed microstructure or moving particles of  `` rarefied gas ''  in the channel without collisions . however , it is easy to imagine physical situation , in which these mechanisms will co - exist .",
    "for instance , one can consider dense gas in closed channel with two of the walls acting as thermostats .",
    "one can expect that main mechanism of the transport will be still related to wave propagation . from the other side , individual particles can move separately and even exchange their positions , and so the transport through the motion of individual particles is also possible .",
    "two particular cases mentioned above ( crystal and non - interacting particles in a channel ) are natural limits of such model for very high and very low densities respectively .",
    "the goal of present paper is to explore the heat conduction in quasi-1d chain with two competing mechanisms of heat transport .    in such simulation",
    "it is desirable to exclude effects related to anomalies of the heat transport in low - dimensional systems . in order to achieve that , according to @xcite , we consider here the model with possibility of complete dissociation . in order to make the model closer to physical reality",
    ", we also include a repulsive hard core .",
    "so , the considered model consists of particles with hard core covered by deformable shell .",
    "so , both phonon - like oscillatory waves and individual motion of the particles are possible .",
    "the heat transport is simulated in a chain of such particles imbedded into a channel with rigid walls . in this model",
    "each particle can move in two dimensions . from the other side",
    ", the geometry of the channel dictates large aspect ratio and therefore one can state that we consider `` quasi - one - dimensional ''   model .",
    "our main goal is to probe this `` quasi - one - dimensionality''through variation of the channel width . for the sake of comparison",
    ", we simulate also a chain of `` billiard ''   particles in the same quasi-1d setting with the possibility of 2d and 3d motion .",
    "let us consider the one - dimensional chain which consists of @xmath0 disks with elastic compressive interaction .",
    "the diameter of the disks is @xmath4 , and the disks have a hard core with diameter @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "the disks repulse each other , if their centers are at a distance less then @xmath7 .",
    "the potential of interaction is defined as : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the distance between the centers and @xmath10 characterizes the stiffness of the disks .",
    "the potential @xmath11 vanishes at the distance @xmath12 , increases monotonically as @xmath9 decreases , and approaches infinity when @xmath13 .",
    "we may notice that for @xmath14 the expression ( [ f1 ] ) takes a common form of lennard - jones 1 - 2 potential .",
