    "in contrast to conventional superconductivity and antiferromagnetism , metallic ferromagnetism is in general an intermediate or strong coupling phenomenon . since there",
    "do not exist systematic investigation schemes to solve such types of problems the stability of metallic ferromagnetism is still not sufficiently understood .",
    "this is true even within the simplest electronic correlation model , the one - band hubbard model,@xcite in spite of significant progress made recently .",
    "the hubbard interaction is very unspecific , i.e. , does not depend on the lattice structure or dimension .",
    "hence the dispersion , and thereby the shape of the density of states ( dos ) , is of considerable importance for the stability of ferromagnetism .",
    "this was recognized already by gutzwiller,@xcite hubbard,@xcite and kanamori@xcite in their initial work on the hubbard model .",
    "however , the approximations used in the early days of many - body theory were usually not reliable enough to provide definite conclusions .",
    "an exception are the exact results by nagaoka@xcite on the stability of ferromagnetism at @xmath4 in the case of one electron above or below half filling .",
    "they show an important lattice sensitivity but , unfortunately , are not applicable in the thermodynamic limit .    over the years",
    "the stability of metallic ferromagnetism has turned out to be a particularly difficult many - body problem whose explanation requires subtle _ nonperturbative _ techniques .",
    "there has been an upsurge of interest in this topic most recently @xcite .",
    "these investigations confirm that ferromagnetism is favored in systems with ( i ) frustrated lattices ( which suppress antiferromagnetism ) and ( ii ) high spectral weight near the band edge closest to the fermi energy ( which improve the kinetic energy of the polarized electrons ) . taken together , these properties imply a strongly asymmetric dos of the electrons .",
    "ferromagnetism on bipartite lattices having a symmetric dos may still be possible , but seems to require very large values of @xmath0.@xcite with the exception of refs .",
    "all previous calculations refer to the ground state .",
    "it is therefore of interest to obtain an answer to the question : _ how does the distribution of spectral weight in the dos influence the stability regime of ferromagnetism at finite temperatures ? _    it should be noted that a strongly peaked , asymmetric dos is a considerably more complex condition for ferromagnetism than the stoner criterion .",
    "the latter merely asserts that , at @xmath5 , the critical interaction for the instability is determined by the inverse of the dos precisely _ at _ the fermi energy @xmath6 , @xmath7 , thus neglecting antiferromagnetism and the structure of the dos away from @xmath6 .",
    "stoner ( i.e. , hartree - fock@xcite ) theory is a purely static mean - field theory which ignores correlation effects , e.g. ,  the correlation - induced redistribution of momentum states and the dynamic renormalizations of the band shape and width .",
    "so the question remains : _ how essential are genuine correlation effects for the stability of itinerant ferromagnetism at finite temperatures ? _",
    "a third question concerns the suitability of the hubbard model itself as a model for ferromagnetism .",
    "indeed there is no compelling _ a priori _ reason why the hubbard model should be a good model for ferromagnetism at all .",
    "not only does it neglect band degeneracy , a feature observed in all ferromagnetic transition metals ( fe , co , ni ) , it also ignores the ( weak ) direct heisenberg exchange interaction which is equivalent to a ferromagnetic spin - spin interaction and hence favors ferromagnetism in the most obvious way.@xcite the proposition by hirsch and coworkers@xcite that this interaction plays a key role in metallic ferromagnetism was disputed by campbell et al.@xcite so the controversial question is :    _ how important is the direct heisenberg exchange interaction for the stability of itinerant ferromagnetism in the one - band hubbard model at finite temperatures ? _    in this paper quantitative answers to the three questions formulated above are given within the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) .",
    "the dmft , a nonperturbative approach , becomes exact in the limit of large coordination numbers.@xcite when applied to @xmath8 , where the coordination number is @xmath9 , the dmft has proven to yield accurate and reliable results , especially in the context of long - range magnetic order.@xcite it treats local correlations exactly while spatial fluctuations are neglected . in this situation",
    "the momentum integral entering in the local propagator will be replaced by an energy integral involving only the dos of the noninteracting electrons .",
    "the latter may be viewed as an input parameter . in our investigation",
    "the question concerning the importance of the distribution of spectral weight within the band for the stability of ferromagnetism will therefore be studied using a model dos of the noninteracting electrons whose shape can be changed continuously from symmetric to strongly asymmetric by varying an asymmetry parameter .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in sec .  ii we present the model under investigation , the dynamical mean - field equations , and the analytical and numerical steps needed to construct magnetic phase diagrams .",
    "the model dos is introduced in sec .",
    "the results of our investigation and quantitative answers to the questions posed above are presented in sec .",
    "iv . a discussion where these results are put into perspective ( sec .",
    "v ) closes the presentation .",
    "the minimal model allowing one to treat an asymmetric dos , electronic on - site correlations , and the nearest - neighbor heisenberg exchange interaction is given by @xmath10 here @xmath11 with the vector of pauli matrices @xmath12 .",
    "we note that there are three other nearest - neighbor contributions of the coulomb interaction which might also effect the stability of the ferromagnetic phase ( see appendix ) .      within the dmft the coupling constants in ( [ exthubm ] ) and ( [ hub ] ) have to be scaled with the lattice coordination number @xmath13 as@xcite @xmath14 , where we consider nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath15 only . by analogy to classical spin models@xcite the hartree - fock approximation yields the exact result for the @xmath1-term in high dimensions .    in the following",
    "we investigate the influence of the direct exchange term on the properties of the hubbard model in @xmath16 .",
    "since the hubbard model is su(2 ) spin - symmetric we can , without loss of generality , assume a magnetization parallel to the @xmath17-axis .",
    "the hartree@xcite decoupling then takes the form @xmath18 . in terms of the magnetization @xmath19 and its expectation value @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the number of lattice sites , the hamiltonian ( [ exthubm ] ) can be written as@xcite    @xmath23    apparently the influence of the exchange term in the limit @xmath24 is that of a ( weiss ) magnetic field which vanishes in the paramagnetic phase ( @xmath25 )",
    "therefore , in this phase , all one - particle properties of the system are those of the pure hubbard model . however , two - particle functions , especially the ferromagnetic susceptibility , are modified ( see sec .  [ iiib ] ) .    in @xmath26 ,",
    "the hubbard model ( [ hub ] ) is equivalent to an anderson impurity model complemented by a self - consistency condition.@xcite written in terms of matsubara frequencies @xmath27 , self energy @xmath28 , the dos of the noninteracting electrons @xmath29 , and thermal average @xmath30 the resulting coupled equations for the green function in the homogeneous phase read : @xmath31    the solution of the @xmath32integrated dyson equation  ( [ sk2 ] ) is straightforward and can be performed analytically for the dos used in this paper ( see sec .",
    "iv ) . by contrast",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "( [ sk1 ] ) is highly nontrivial ( for details of the notation see ref . ) .",
    "it is achieved using the auxiliary - field quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) algorithm by hirsch and fye,@xcite where a discretization of imaginary time , @xmath33 , is introduced . here",
    ", @xmath34 denotes the number of independent matsubara frequencies .",
    "physical quantities are obtained in the @xmath35 limit .      the second order phase transition from a para- to",
    "a ferromagnetic phase occurs at the zero of the inverse susceptibility @xmath36 , calculated@xcite in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "it is sufficient to perform all simulations for the pure hubbard model since the influence of @xmath37 on the susceptibility is given by the following random - phase approximation ( rpa)-like expression : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the susceptibility of the pure hubbard model .",
    "this type of relation holds for pairs of two - particle interactions ( here @xmath0 and @xmath37 ) in arbitrary dimensions , whenever one interaction ( here @xmath37 ) is treated in hartree - fock approximation and the other one ( here @xmath0 ) exactly.@xcite in general , since the calculation of the susceptibility involves the derivative of the self - energy @xmath40 with respect to some field @xmath41,@xcite this follows from the fact that the self - energy of the full hamiltonian can be expressed as @xmath42=\\sigma_{u,0}[g_{u , f^ * } ]   + \\sigma_{0,f^*}^{(1)}[g_{u , f^*}].\\ ] ] here @xmath43 $ ] refers to the diagrammatic skeleton expansion of @xmath44 , where all lines are fully dressed propagators @xmath45 .",
    "since the hartree - fock term @xmath46 only contributes in the symmetry - broken phase , all @xmath37-renormalizations of @xmath47 vanish in the symmetric phase . evaluating @xmath48 in the symmetric phase , the first term in ( [ sigma ] ) leads to the same contributions as without @xmath37-interaction , while the second term introduces the rpa - like term proportional to @xmath37 . for the @xmath15-@xmath49 model in dmft the analogue of ( [ rpa ] ) was derived by pruschke et al.@xcite    since @xmath37 only enters the calculations via eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) we are left with four physical parameters of the pure hubbard model : hubbard interaction @xmath0 , electron density @xmath2 , temperature @xmath3 and an asymmetry parameter @xmath50 for the kinetic energy ( see sec .",
    "iv ) . for each set of these five parameters eqs .  ( [ sk2 ] ) and ( [ sk1 ] )",
    "are iterated with typically @xmath51 monte carlo sweeps until convergence is reached , i.e. , the difference between two consecutive values of ( @xmath52@xmath53 ( @xmath45@xmath54 @xmath44@xmath55 is smaller than @xmath56 ( measured by the norm @xmath57 ; the energy scale is defined in sec .",
    "subsequently eight measurements of the susceptibility are performed with a reduced number of @xmath58 monte carlo sweeps .",
    "thus the result for each parameter set consists of an averaged susceptibility @xmath59 and its statistical error @xmath60 .",
    "we neglect the propagation of the error in ( @xmath52@xmath61 since it is always an order of magnitude smaller than @xmath60 .",
    "the extrapolation to @xmath62 is performed by a quadratic least squares fit of @xmath59 , using at least six different values of @xmath63 for @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "further details regarding the technical treatment can be found in refs .  .    for mean - field theories like the dmft a linear behavior of the inverse susceptibility , i.e. , a curie - weiss law ,",
    "is expected and observed in the vicinity of the transition .",
    "thus the curie temperature @xmath65 can be obtained as the zero of a linear fit of @xmath66 drawn from values of @xmath63 for four to six different temperatures ( see , e.g. ,  figs .",
    "[ fvst ] and  [ fvsta ] , where @xmath67 ( [ rpa ] ) is plotted ) . the error of @xmath65 is obtained from the errors @xmath60 by error propagation and therefore denotes only statistical , not systematic errors ( e.g. , due to the extrapolation schemes used ) .",
    "however , we checked the accuracy of our results by varying the procedure , e.g. , extrapolating @xmath68 instead of @xmath59 .",
    "due to the vanishing of spatial fluctuations within the dmft the topology of the underlying lattice enters the self - consistency equation  ( [ sk2 ] ) only via the noninteracting dos , at least for homogeneous phases .",
    "the choice of a particular model spectral function thus represents a special ( not unique ) set of hopping elements @xmath69 in the hamiltonian  ( [ exthubm ] ) which characterize the structure of the underlying lattice .",
    "contributions to the kinetic energy by , e.g. , next - nearest - neighbor hopping can lead to an asymmetrically shaped dos , which is apparently favorable for the stability of ferromagnetism . to investigate this stabilizing effect quantitatively",
    ", we propose a model dos with a shape - controlling parameter .",
    "this parameter allows us to change smoothly from a noninteracting dos with ( i ) a symmetric shape ( mimicking nearest - neighbor hopping on a bipartite lattice ) to ( ii ) an asymmetrically peaked dos ( similar to a cubic lattice with next - nearest - neighbor hopping ) to ( iii ) a dos with a square - root divergence at the band edge ( e.g. , a fcc lattice with next - nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath70 ) .",
    "the shape of the model dos thus qualitatively captures key features of real lattices .    the spectral function which we use throughout the paper is given by @xmath71 with @xmath72 and bandwidth @xmath73 .",
    "the well - known semielliptic dos of the bethe lattice with infinite number of nearest neighbors is recovered for @xmath74 . by increasing the parameter",
    "@xmath50 spectral weight is shifted towards the lower band edge ( fig .  [ dos ] ) .",
    "for @xmath75 the dos diverges at the lower band edge like an inverse square - root . the particular choice of the model dos ( [ ndos ] ) has the advantage that the numerical effort of solving the self - consistency equation ( [ sk2 ] ) is rather small since the hilbert transform can be calculated analytically .",
    "in the following we set the variance to unity , @xmath76 ^ 2=1 $ ] , thereby fixing the energy scale .",
    "this leads to @xmath77 for all values of @xmath50 .",
    "for @xmath74 it is equivalent to choosing @xmath78 on the bethe lattice .    while for the study of ferromagnetism within the dmft the lattice structure only enters via the dos it is possible to construct ( infinitely many ) corresponding dispersion relations @xmath79(@xmath32 ) or , equivalently , sets of hopping elements @xmath80 .",
    "a realization in @xmath81 that is symmetric , @xmath82 , and monotonous , @xmath83 , for @xmath84 is given by    # 1#2    @xmath85    where an inversion yields @xmath86 .",

    "antiferromagnetism or incommensurate phases are not expected to be important far away from half filling . only for the case",
    "@xmath74 ( bethe lattice ) at @xmath90 the stability of an antiferromagnetic phase is investigated .",
    "on a bipartite lattice with perfect nesting , the ground state of the pure hubbard model at half filling is antiferromagnetic for all @xmath91 , at least in dimensions @xmath92 .",

    "[ tvsnf ] ) .",

[ fvsta ] at @xmath112 for a relatively small electron density @xmath113 . for a symmetric or slightly asymmetric dos ( @xmath74 , @xmath114 )",
    "the system only becomes ferromagnetic for @xmath115 even at @xmath5 . for @xmath116 , when the shape of the dos is roughly triangular , the critical @xmath37 is considerably reduced .",

    "evidently the ferromagnetic phase becomes more favorable for increasing @xmath0 : both the maximal curie temperature and the ( upper ) critical density rise .",

    "[ tvsnhf ] shows the vast overestimation of the ferromagnetic phase within hartree - fock . the maximal curie temperature obtained in this approximation is more than an order of magnitude too large . at such high temperatures details of the dos",
    "are averaged out and consequently the density dependence ( e.g. , the position of the maximum ) is completely artificial . in fig .",
    "[ uvsnhf ] the @xmath0 vs.  @xmath2 ground state phase diagram is shown and compared to the stoner criterion.@xcite at low @xmath2 the stoner curve clearly approaches the qmc curve .",
    "since the dos vanishes smoothly at the lower band edge for @xmath123 both curves diverge for @xmath124 .",
    "figure  [ tvsuhf ] focuses on the limit of large @xmath0 .",
    "the weak coupling hartree - fock theory fails again : it predicts an unbounded linear increase of @xmath65 with @xmath0 , @xmath125 , whereas qmc shows that @xmath65 has a finite limit for @xmath126 .",
    "it is expected that such a finite limit exists for all densities .",
    "a saturation is also suggested by the curves in fig .",
    "[ tvsnu ] .",
    "it arises from the suppression of double occupancies by correlations .",
    "in contrast to the hartree - fock prediction the interaction energy goes to zero for @xmath126 , thus only the bandwidth remains as an energy scale . in the special case @xmath102 , @xmath127 one finds@xcite @xmath128 .    #",
    "1#2    # 1#2    # 1#2    # 1#2    one might argue that comparison of the dmft results should not be made with hartree - fock itself but with hartree - fock plus quantum corrections , since the latter are known to reduce many of the deficiencies of hartree - fock .",
    "such corrections have been discussed by van dongen@xcite and freericks and jarrell.@xcite the latter authors showed how quantum fluctuations modify the stoner criterion by subtracting the particle - particle susceptibility . evaluating these corrections in the case of fig .",
    "[ tvsuhf ] we find that the ferromagnetic phase is completely suppressed ( as previously observed in ref .   for a symmetric dos ) . at @xmath102",
    "this holds for all densities @xmath129 .",
    "thus the `` corrections '' to hartree - fock are seen to _ underestimate _ the ferromagnetic region by far .",
    "after more than three decades of research it has become clear at last@xcite that the hubbard model can describe itinerant ferromagnetism even on regular lattices and at moderate @xmath0-values for a wide range of electronic densities @xmath2 .",
    "since ferromagnetism is an intermediate to strong coupling problem the question concerning its `` mechanism '' has , in principle , no straightforward answer .",
    "this is in contrast to _ weak _ coupling phenomena , e.g. , conventional superconductivity , which can be explained within perturbation theory .",
    "nevertheless a good starting point for an understanding of the origin of itinerant ferromagnetism can be obtained in the strong coupling limit . at @xmath4",
    "doubly occupied sites are excluded and the hubbard model reduces to a ( complicated ) kinetic energy . to avoid doubly occupied sites in a paramagnetic phase",
    "the dos is then necessarily strongly renormalized compared with the noninteracting case , whereas for the saturated ferromagnetic phase the interacting dos is the same as the noninteracting one except for a shift between the spin - up and -down bands . in this situation details of the structure of the noninteracting dos become relevant in selecting the state with the lowest energy .",
    "this physical picture is , in principle , similar to that underlying the nagaoka mechanism ; however , the latter only addresses the kinetic energy of a single hole and it was so far not possible to generalize it to thermodynamically relevant densities .",
    "our investigations within the dmft explicitly show that a moderately strong peak at the band edge closest to the fermi energy is sufficient to stabilize ferromagnetism .",
    "furthermore a strong asymmetry of the dos implies a nonbipartite lattice which frustrates the competing antiferromagnetism near half filling .",
    "the mechanism described above is completely different from the mere band shift of the hartree - fock theory .",
    "this weak coupling approach does not take into account the dynamical renormalization of the dos in the paramagnetic phase and thus predicts ferromagnetism for any dos , even at relatively small values of @xmath0 and for high temperatures .",
    "the comparison with dmft clearly shows that hartree - fock ( i ) overestimates transition temperatures by more than an order of magnitude , ( ii ) renders the dependence of @xmath65 on @xmath0 qualitatively incorrect , and ( iii ) predicts ferromagnetism for the symmetric dos , where ( at least for @xmath120 ) this is not found .",
    "these shortcomings of hartree - fock theory are due to the neglect of dynamical fluctuations which are at the heart of the correlation problem .",
    "the heisenberg exchange interaction , not considered in the pure hubbard model , provides another mechanism that may order the fluctuating local moments arising by the suppression of double occupancies .",
    "we found that for a symmetric dos rather large values of @xmath1 are needed to stabilize ferromagnetism .",
    "however , for an asymmetric dos with a peak near the band edge already small values of the exchange interaction may provide the final `` kick '' towards ferromagnetism . in any case it reduces the critical on - site interaction and increases the critical temperatures of the ferromagnetic phase boundary .    while the dmft correctly describes the dynamic fluctuations of the interacting many - body system , it neglects spatial fluctuations and short - range order .",
    "hence one should suspect that this approach overestimates the transition temperatures @xmath65 .",
    "within dmft ulmke@xcite estimated @xmath65 for a three - dimensional fcc lattice to be of the order of 500 to 800 k which is in the range of realistic transition temperatures .",
    "we may expect spatial fluctuations to reduce these temperatures . on the other hand , band degeneracy ,",
    "not considered in our model so far , is expected to increase @xmath65 .",
    "indeed , band degeneracy and hund s rule couplings which are clearly present in realistic systems can be rigorously shown to improve the stability of ferromagnetism at least for special parameter values.@xcite the incorporation of band degeneracy , for which the dmft also provides a suitable framework , is the most important feature that has to be included in future investigations of the hubbard model.@xcite the additional nearest - neighbor interactions discussed in the appendix may provide yet another mechanism for ferromagnetism and will be studied in the future .",
    "we are very grateful to m.  kollar and m.  ulmke for numerous helpful discussions .",
    "one of us ( n.b . ) thanks the fulbright commission for support and the department of physics at the university of illinois for hospitality",
    ". computations were performed on the cray t90 of the hlrz jlich .",
    "in wannier representation the coulomb interaction gives rise to the purely local interaction @xmath0 as well as to four nearest - neighbor interactions . @xcite besides the heisenberg exchange interaction these are the density - density interaction , the pair - hopping term , and the off - diagonal `` bond - charge  site - charge''@xcite interaction .",
    "the latter effectively describes a density - dependent hopping @xcite and leads to a narrowing of the band .",
    "hence this term is expected to stabilize saturated ferromagnetism . since the quantum dynamics of this term make a systematic investigation difficult  even within the dmft ",
    "its detailed study has to be postponed to the future .",
    "the pair - hopping term also weakly enhances ferromagnetic tendencies.@xcite    among all nearest - neighbor interactions the density - density term @xmath130 is largest and is thus investigated explicitly in the following . in the case of d - electrons hubbard roughly estimated this term to @xmath131=2 - 3 ev , an order of magnitude smaller than the hubbard interaction @xmath0.@xcite however , since there are @xmath13 neighbors contributing , the total energy of the nearest - neighbor density - density interactions may in some materials even surpass that of the hubbard interaction .",
    "this raises the question of the importance of the @xmath131-term , in particular its influence on the ferromagnetic phases investigated in the present paper .",
    "it was already pointed out by mller - hartmann@xcite that in the limit @xmath132 and with the proper scaling @xmath133 the nearest - neighbor density - density interaction reduces to its hartree contribution which may then be viewed as a simple , site - dependent shift of the chemical potential . in the absence of broken translational symmetry",
    "the chemical potential must compensate this shift to keep the electron density fixed .",
    "then there is no effect at all .",
    "on bipartite lattices translational symmetry can be broken by a charge density wave ( cdw ) with different electron densities on a and b sublattices , i.e. , with order parameter @xmath134 . to study this possible",
    "ordering we analyze the instability towards a cdw in the following .",

    "( [ rpa])]:@xcite @xmath135 thus a second order phase transition to a cdw occurs at @xmath136 .",
