    "studies of rare decays of @xmath4 mesons have the potential to uncover the origin of cp violation , which may lie outside the standard model of strong and electroweak interactions .",
    "the measurements of several asymmetries will make it possible to test whether the ckm mechanism of cp violation is sufficient , or whether additional sources of cp violation are required to describe the data . in order to achieve this goal ,",
    "it is necessary that the theoretical calculations of cp - violating observables in terms of standard model parameters are , at least to a large extent , free of hadronic uncertainties .",
    "this can be achieved , for instance , by measuring time - dependent asymmetries in the decays of neutral @xmath4 mesons into particular cp eigenstates . in many other cases ,",
    "however , the theoretical predictions for direct cp violation in exclusive @xmath4 decays are obscured by large strong - interaction effects @xcite@xcite , which can only partly be controlled using the approximate flavour symmetries of qcd @xcite .",
    "inclusive decay rates of @xmath4 mesons , on the other hand , can be reliably calculated in qcd using the operator product expansion .",
    "up to small bound - state corrections these rates agree with the parton model predictions for the underlying decays of the @xmath5 quark @xcite@xcite .",
    "the possibility of observing mixing - induced cp asymmetries in inclusive decays of neutral @xmath4 mesons has been emphasized in ref .",
    "the disadvantage that the inclusive sum over many final states partially dilutes the asymmetries is compensated by the fact that , because of the short - distance nature of inclusive processes , the strong phases are calculable using quark ",
    "hadron duality .",
    "the resulting cp asymmetries are proportional to the strong coupling constant @xmath6 .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to study direct cp violation in the rare radiative decays @xmath1 , both in the standard model and beyond .",
    "these decays have already been observed experimentally , and copious data samples will be collected at the @xmath4 factories .",

    "several extensions of the standard model in which new contributions to dipole operators arise have been explored , e.g. , in refs .",
    "we find that in the standard model the direct cp asymmetry in the decays @xmath1 is very small ( below 1% in magnitude ) because of a combination of ckm and gim suppression , both of which can be lifted in extensions of the standard model . if there are new contributions to the dipole operators with sizable weak phases , they can induce a cp asymmetry that is more than an order of magnitude larger than in the standard model .",
    "we thus propose a measurement of the inclusive cp asymmetry in the decays @xmath3 as a clean and sensitive probe of new physics . for simplicity , we shall not consider here the most general scenario of having other , non - standard operators in the effective hamiltonian .",

    "rather small asymmetries of order a few percent or less are obtained . here , we generalize and extend these analyses in various ways . besides including some contributions to the asymmetry neglected in previous works , we shall investigate in detail a class of new physics models with enhanced chromo - magnetic dipole contributions , in which large cp asymmetries of order 1050% are possible and even natural .",

    "comparing figures  [ fig : models1 ] and [ fig : models1lr ] , we observe that although there is a clear dilution of the resulting cp asymmetries caused by the inclusion of opposite - chirality operators , there is still plenty of parameter space in which the asymmetries are much larger than in the standard model .",
    "we should also point out that , if there is more than one significant new physics contribution to the dipole operators , there need not be any dilution since the product @xmath160 could develop an imaginary part , thus providing an additional contribution to the cp asymmetry",
    ".    finally , we briefly discuss what happens in models with ckm unitarity violation . in terms of the quantity @xmath161 defined by @xmath162 , the result for the cp asymmetry in ( [ acp ] )",
    "generalizes to @xmath163      - \\frac{8z}{9}\\,\\big [ v(z ) + b(z,\\delta ) \\big]\\ ,      \\mbox{im}[(1+\\epsilon_s+\\delta_s ) c_2 c_7^ * ] \\nonumber\\\\     & & \\hspace{1.35 cm }      \\mbox{}- \\frac 49\\,\\mbox{im}[c_8 c_7^ * ]      + \\frac{8z}{27}\\,b(z,\\delta)\\,\\mbox{im}[(1+\\epsilon_s      + \\delta_s ) c_2 c_8^ * ] \\bigg\\ } \\ , .",
    "\\label{nockm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath161 parametrizes the deviation from unitarity of the 3-generation ckm matrix , which could be caused , for instance , by mixing of the known down quarks with a new isosinglet heavy quark , or by the existence of a sequential fourth generation of quarks . in principle , asymmetries much larger than in the standard model could be attained provided that @xmath161 has a significant weak phase .",
    "this reflects the fact that the gim suppression is no longer at work if ckm unitarity is violated .",
    "however , we will now show that in plausible scenarios the effect of @xmath161 on the cp asymmetry is very small . in the case of mixing with isosinglets , existing experimental limits @xcite on the fcnc process",
    "@xmath13 induced by tree - level @xmath164 exchange @xcite imply @xmath165 .",
    "the impact of non - unitarity can therefore be safely neglected , since new contributions to the cp asymmetry would be well below 1% .",
    "let us , therefore , turn to the case of a sequential fourth generation with a new up - type quark denoted by @xmath166 .",
    "as before , we will neglect the small quantity @xmath38 , so that @xmath167 $ ] is the only source of cp violation",
    ". then the above expression can be rewritten in the simpler form @xmath168 + a_{87}\\,\\mbox{im}\\!\\left [ \\frac{c_8}{c_7 } \\right ]     + a_{28}(\\delta)\\,\\mbox{im}\\!\\left [ \\frac{(1+\\delta_s)c_2}{c_7 }     \\cdot\\frac{c_8^*}{c_7^ * } \\right ] \\,.\\ ] ] in such a scenario , the cp asymmetry is affected not only by the non - unitarity of the 3-generation ckm matrix with @xmath169 in ( [ nockm ] ) , but also by the new contributions of the @xmath166 quark to the wilson coefficients @xmath10 and @xmath11 at the scale @xmath170 . in analogy with ( [ sminitial ] ) , we have @xmath171      \\,,\\qquad     c_8(m_w ) = -\\frac 12 \\big [ d(x_t ) + \\delta_s d(x_{t ' } ) \\big ] \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath172 .",
    "in addition , there is a modification to the evolution equations ( [ evol ] ) for the wilson coefficients @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where now the last terms ( those involving the coefficients @xmath173 and @xmath174 ) must be multiplied by @xmath175 .",
    "taking @xmath176gev for the purpose of illustration , we obtain @xmath177 and @xmath178 , i.e.  to a good approximation we have @xmath179 . this just reflects the fact that the functions @xmath180 and @xmath181 are slowly varying for @xmath182 . in this limit",
    ", however , all dependence on @xmath161 cancels in the expression for the cp asymmetry . as a result",
    ", there is in general not much potential for having large cp asymmetries in models with a sequential fourth generation . for all realistic choices of parameters ,",
    "we find asymmetries of less than 2% , i.e.  of a similar magnitude as in the standard model .",
    "we have presented a study of direct cp violation in the inclusive , radiative decays @xmath1 . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", inclusive decay rates entail the advantage of being calculable in qcd , so that a reliable prediction for the cp asymmetry can be confronted with data . from a practical point of view , it is encouraging that the rare radiative decays of @xmath4 mesons have already been observed experimentally , and high - statistics measurements of the corresponding rates will be possible in the near future .",
    "we find that in the standard model the cp asymmetry in @xmath1 decays is strongly suppressed by three small parameters : @xmath6 arising from the necessity of having strong phases , @xmath183 reflecting a ckm suppression , and @xmath184 resulting from a gim suppression . as a result , the cp asymmetry can be safely predicted to be of order 1% in magnitude .",
    "this conclusion will not be significantly modified by long - distance contributions .",
    "we have argued that the latter two suppression factors are inoperative in extensions of the standard model for which the effective wilson coefficients @xmath10 and @xmath11 receive additional contributions involving non - trivial weak phases .",
    "much larger cp asymmetries of @xmath15 are therefore possible in such cases .",
    "we have presented a model - independent analysis of new physics scenarios in terms of the magnitudes and phases of the wilson coefficients @xmath10 and @xmath11 , finding that , indeed , sizable cp asymmetries are predicted in large regions of parameter space .",
    "some explicit realizations of models with large cp asymmetries have been illustrated .",
    "in particular , we have shown that asymmetries of 1050% are possible in models which allow for a strong enhancement of the contribution from the chromo - magnetic dipole operator .",
    "this is , in fact , quite natural unless there is a symmetry that forbids new weak phases from entering the coefficients @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "we have also shown that the predictions for the cp asymmetry are only moderately diluted if operators involving right - handed light - quark fields are included in the analysis .",
    "on the other hand , we confirm the findings of previous authors regarding the smallness of the cp asymmetry that is attainable in two - higgs - doublet models and in left ",
    "right symmetric models .",
    "moreover , we find very small effects for models in which 3-generation unitarity is violated . quite generally , having a large cp asymmetry is not in conflict with the observed value for the cp - averaged @xmath1 branching ratio . on the contrary",
    ", it may even help to lower the theoretical prediction for this quantity , and likewise for the semileptonic branching ratio and charm multiplicity in @xmath4 decays , thereby bringing these three observables closer to their experimental values .",
    "the fact that a large inclusive cp asymmetry in @xmath1 decays is possible in many generic extensions of the standard model , and in a large region of parameter space , offers the exciting possibility of looking for a signature of new physics in these decays using data sets that will become available during the first period of operation of the @xmath4 factories ( if not existing data sets ) .",
    "a negative result of such a study would impose constraints on many new physics scenarios .",
    "a large positive signal , on the other hand , would provide interesting clues about the nature of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "in particular , a cp asymmetry exceeding the level of 10% would be a strong hint towards enhanced chromo - magnetic dipole transitions caused by some new flavour physics at a high scale .",
    "we have restricted our analysis to the case of inclusive radiative decays since they entail the advantage of being very clean , in the sense that the strong - interaction phases relevant for direct cp violation can be reliably calculated . however ,",
    "if there is new physics that induces a large inclusive cp asymmetry in @xmath1 decays , it will inevitably also lead to sizable asymmetries in some related processes .",
    "in particular , since we found that the inclusive cp asymmetry remains almost unaffected if a cut on the high - energy part of the photon energy spectrum is imposed , we expect that a large asymmetry will persist in the exclusive mode @xmath185 , even though a reliable theoretical analysis would be much more difficult because of the necessity of calculating final - state rescattering phases @xcite .",
    "still , it is worthwhile searching for a large cp asymmetry in this channel .    finally , it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that new physics can lead to a large time - dependent cp asymmetry in exclusive @xmath186 decays through interference of mixing and decay .",
    "large direct cp violation would introduce hadronic uncertainties , thus complicating the analysis of this effect .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that the two phenomena are in a sense complementary in that to a large extent they probe different new physics contributions .",
    "we have seen that direct cp asymmetries in radiative @xmath4 decays are primarily sensitive to modifications of the wilson coefficients of the dipole operators with standard chirality . on the other hand ,",
    "the presence of dipole operators with right - handed light - quark fields , which are of negligible strength in the standard model , is crucial for obtaining time - dependent asymmetries , since these require both the @xmath187 and @xmath188 to be able to decay to states with the same photon helicity .",
