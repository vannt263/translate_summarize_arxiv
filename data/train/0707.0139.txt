    "there have been collected many evidences ( due to polarization time - resolved experiments , @xcite computer simulations , @xcite and model studies @xcite ) which indicate that rotational and orientational relaxations of molecules in liquids under equilibrium and ( highly ) nonequilibrium conditions differ significantly .",
    "the studies of nonequilibrium rotational relaxation have recently culminated in papers .",
    "@xcite as has been demonstrated , relaxation of rotational energy of hot nonequilibrium photofragments slows significantly with the increase of their initial rotational temperature and differs dramatically from relaxation of the equilibrium rotational energy correlation function , manifesting thereby breakdown of the linear response description .",
    "furthermore , hot nonequilibrium molecules exhibit almost dissipation - free coherent rotation , which persists for several rotational periods .",
    "molecular dynamic simulations have attributed this unusual behavior to a rapid rearrangement of the local liquid structure : a hot solute pushes away the neighboring solvent molecules and rotates almost freely until it looses enough energy .",
    "@xcite another way of thinking about that is in terms of the angular momentum dependent rotational friction : highly rotationally excited molecules experience lower friction than their thermally equilibrated counterparts .",
    "@xcite    these nonequilibrium relaxations are not reproduced by conventional theories of ( equilibrium ) molecular rotation , which are based upon master equations with constant relaxation rates ( the extended diffusion models , @xcite the keilson - storer model @xcite ) or rotational fokker - planck equations with constant frictions .",
    "@xcite physically , this is not surprising .",
    "if we consider relaxation under equilibrium conditions , then all the relevant energies are of the order of @xmath0 ( @xmath1 being the boltzmann constant and @xmath2 being the temperature of the bath ) .",
    "so , putting aside non - markovian effects , we can always introduce a certain effective constant relaxation rate .",
    "if we consider relaxation under nonequilibrium conditions , when initial energies are much higher than @xmath0 , such a description is no longer applicable , and the angular momentum dependence of relaxation rates must be explicitly taken into consideration ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more detailed argumentation and discussion ) .",
    "there exist two major and complimentary approaches to rotational relaxation , via the fokker - planck equations @xcite and extended diffusion models .",
    "@xcite in our previous paper , @xcite we have demonstrated how the angular - momentum dependent friction can be incorporated into the rotational fokker - planck equation .",
    "the present paper deals with a similar generalization of the j - diffusion model .",
    "first , we investigate how the angular momentum dependent rates manifest themselves in relaxations of initial nonequilibrium distributions and in behaviors of rotational and orientational correlation functions ( cfs ) .",
    "second , we develop a reliable tool for the description of nonequilibrium molecular rotation , which can be used i.e. for the interpretation of photofragment anisotropy decays .",
    "@xcite third , we demonstrate how the use of standard  equilibrium ",
    "approaches may lead to quantitatively and even qualitatively wrong results , if they are applied to describe nonequilibrium molecular rotation .",
    "photodissociation @xmath3 ( which was studied experimentally in the gas - phase @xcite and in the condensed phase @xcite , and also investigated via computer simulations @xcite ) is chosen in the present article as a prototype process which produces highly nonequilibrium hot photofragments .",
    "the results of the molecular dynamics simulations @xcite are used to obtain realistic values of the model parameters and to test our theoretical predictions .",
    "the structure of our paper is as follows . the generalized j - diffusion model , which accounts for the angular momentum dependence of the relaxation rate , is developed in sec .",
    "a convenient explicit expression for the initial nonequilibrium angular momentum distribution is derived in section 3 .",
    "relaxation of this nonequilibrium distribution , as well as dynamics of the angular momentum and energy cfs , are investigated in section 4 .",
    "orientational relaxation is studied in section 5 .",
    "the appendixes describe the methods of calculation of rotational cfs ( a ) , their relaxation times ( b ) , and orientational cfs ( c ) .",
    "the reduced variables are used throughout the article : time , angular momentum and energy are measured in units of @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath0 , respectively . here",

    "the last two terms are responsible for the bath - induced relaxation .",
    "since our molecular ensemble is isotropic , the kernel of the dissipation operator , @xmath17 , is @xmath15-independent .",

    "it is in this case the effects due to the @xmath25-dependence of relaxation rates become important . note that the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath35 must be independent of initial conditions .",

    "@xcite let us consider the photoreaction @xmath50 .",
    "we assume that the photofragmentation is instantaneous on the time scale of molecular rotation .",
    "this assumption holds true for most of small @xcite and polyatomic @xcite molecules , for which the photofragmentation time can be be estimated by few hundreds of femtoseconds .",
    "@xcite having accepted the assumption about an instantaneous ( impulsive ) photodecomposition , we immediately conclude that dissociation produces a nonequilibrium distribution over the angular momenta of photoproducts .",
    "indeed , there exist two major sources of rotational excitation of fragments .",
    "these are the parent molecule rotation and the applied torque .",

    "the last two parameters control the parent - product rotational energy transfer .",

    "we have generalized the standard j - diffusion model by allowing its dissipation rate to be angular momentum dependent and calculated various nonequilibrium rotational and orientational cfs .",
    "the reaction @xmath3 has been selected as a prototype process which produces highly nonequilibrium hot photofragments .",
    "we have used the results of computer simulations @xcite to obtain realistic values of the model parameters and to test our theoretical predictions .",
    "we have found that nonequilibrium rotational relaxation rates assume the form @xmath191 , where @xmath24 is the equilibrium rate , @xmath45 is the initial `` nonequilibrium energy '' , @xmath2 is the equilibrium temperature of the heat bath , and @xmath35 is the dimensionless small parameter fixed for a system under study .",
    "accordingly , the relaxation times have the arrhenius energy dependence , @xmath192 .",
    "so , there exist characteristic `` nonequilibrium energy '' @xmath193 and `` nonequilibrium temperature '' @xmath194 , starting from which the @xmath25-dependence of relaxation rate becomes important and induces a significant slowing of rotational relaxation . in agreement with simulations , @xcite relaxation of the rotational probability density",
    "is shown to be a bimodal time - dependent mixture of the initial nonequilibrium and final equilibrium distributions .",
    "the slowing of rotational relaxation induces a long lifetime of the initial nonequilibrium contribution , which manifests itself in pronounced coherent effects .",
    "the slowing of rotational relaxation causes qualitative changes in molecular reorientation . in agreement with simulations ,",
    "@xcite hot nonequilibrium molecules exhibit slightly perturbed coherent rotation , which persists for several rotational periods .",
    "a similar observation has recently been made in the context of molecular excitation by strong femtosecond pulses : nonequilibrium molecular wave packets can be formed in such a way as to slow their subsequent rotational relaxation .",
    "@xcite    we have demonstrated that orientational cfs in the overdamped limit are described by the diffusion equation with the diffusion coefficient equaled to the _ equilibrium _ angular momentum integral relaxation time , @xmath174 .",
    "thus the orientational relaxation times @xmath179 obey the generalized hubbard relation , @xmath195^{-1}$ ] . since the nonequilibrium angular momentum relaxation time @xmath190 can differ substantially from its equilibrium counterpart @xmath174 ,",
    "the standard hubbard relation , @xcite in which @xmath174 is replaced by @xmath190 , can be significantly off .",
    "it should be emphasized that all rotational and orientational cfs and their relaxation times dependent explicitly on the nonequilibrium preparation of the molecular ensemble .",
    "this effect is unreproducible within the standard ( equilibrium ) rotational models , which predict that relaxation rates are independent of initial conditions and are given by the linear response theory .",
    "thus , the arrhenius forms of the rotational relaxation times , slowing down of rotational relaxation , and violation of the hubbard relations are all manifestations of the breakdown of the linear response theory far from equilibrium .    in practical terms ,",
    "the standard and generalized j - diffusion models are almost indistinguishable under equilibrium conditions . under nonequilibrium conditions ,",
    "their predictions differ dramatically .",
    "the differences are not only quantitative but , not infrequently , qualitative .",
    "the message is thus as follows : the friction and/or the relaxation rate must be taken @xmath25-dependent in order to adequately describe rotational relaxation far from equilibrium .",
    "note , finally , that our theory can straightforwardly be generalized to symmetric and asymmetric top molecules . in this latter case",
    ", the relaxation rate can be taken rotational energy dependent , rather than angular momentum dependent .",
    "the method of solution of the corresponding kinetic equations remains absolutely the same , and the explicit formulas for various cfs can be written down after a straightforward generalization of the results presented in the appendixes .",
    "our theory is also readily extendable to quantum case , by replacing the integrations over the angular momentum @xmath25 with summations over the rotational quantum number @xmath88 , and switching from the classical orientational cfs ( [ free ] ) to their quantum mechanical counterparts ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "such a generalization might be useful for describing rotational coherences and time - dependent alignments in nonequilibrium dissipative systems , like those studied in ref .",
    "let @xmath113 and @xmath114 be arbitrary functions of the angular momentum",
