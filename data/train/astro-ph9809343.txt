    "the major planar structure in the local universe , the supergalactic plane ( sgp ) , was recognized by de vaucouleurs ( 1953 , 1956 , 1958 , 1975a , b ) using the shapley - ames catalogue , following an earlier analysis of radial velocities of nearby galaxies which suggested a differential rotation of the ` metagalaxy ' by rubin ( 1951 ) .",
    "this remarkable feature in the distribution of nebulae was in fact already noticed by william herschel more than 200 years earlier ( for historical reviews see flin 1986 , rubin 1989 ) .    when referring to the sgp in this paper we mean the planar structure in the galaxy distribution .",
    "this should be distinguished from the formal definition of supergalactic coordinates .",
    "de vaucouleurs  ( 1976 , 1991 ) defined a spherical coordinate system @xmath8 in which the equator roughly lies along the sgp ( as identified at the time ) , with the north pole ( @xmath9 ) in the direction of galactic coordinates ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the position @xmath11 is at ( @xmath12 ) , which is one of the two regions where the sgp is crossed by the galactic plane .",
    "the virgo cluster is at ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "traditionally , the virgo cluster was regarded as the centre of an overdense region called the ` local supercluster ' ( e.g. davis & huchra 1982 , hoffman & salpeter 1982 , tully & shaya 1984 , lilje , yahil & jones 1986 ) .",
    "however , some of the much larger superclusters that are seen in recent redshift surveys , such as the great attractor and perseus - pisces , are near the sgp , and are possibly connected with the local supercluster , in the sense of being simply connected by an isodensity contour above the mean density ( cf . ,",
    "strauss  1992 ; strauss & willick 1995 ; santiago  1995 ) .",
    "although the sgp is clearly visible in whole - sky galaxy catalogues ( e.g. lynden - bell & lahav 1988 ; lynden - bell  1988 ; raychaudhury 1989 ; see also the references above ) , the extent of planar structure in the galaxy distribution in 3 dimensions has seen little quantitative examination in recent years .",
    "tully ( 1986 , 1987 ) claimed that the flattened distribution of clusters extends across a diameter of @xmath14 with axial ratios of 4:2:1 .",
    "shaver & pierre ( 1989 ) found that radio galaxies are more strongly concentrated to the sgp than are optical galaxies , and that the sgp as represented by radio galaxies extends out to redshift @xmath15 .",
    "stanev  ( 1995 ) claimed that energetic cosmic rays arrive preferentially from the direction of the sgp , where potential sources ( e.g. radio galaxies ) are concentrated , but this result was criticized by waxman , fisher & piran ( 1997 ) .",
    "di nella & paturel ( 1995 ) revisited the sgp using a compilation of nearly 5700 galaxies larger than 1.6 arcmin , and found indeed that galaxies were concentrated close to the supergalactic plane .",
    "loan ( 1997 ) and baleisis  ( 1998 ) searched for the sgp in projection in the 87 gb ( north ) and pmn ( south ) radio surveys , and found signatures at the 1 and 3 @xmath16 levels , respectively .",
    "the existence of a pancake - like structure has important theoretical implications .",
    "gravity amplifies deviations from sphericity , i.e. an initial oblate homogeneous ellipsoid evolves into a disk , and an initial prolate structure ends up as a spindle ( lin , mestel & shu 1965 ) .",
    "white & silk ( 1979 ) modeled the local supercluster as a homogeneous ellipsoid in expanding universe , and considered implications for cosmological models and initial conditions .",
    "although such a simple model is insightful , the structure of the sgp is far more complicated than a homogeneous ellipsoid , as we show below . in a more realistic cosmological scenario , where the primordial density field is gaussian , non - spherical shapes are more abundant than spherical ones ( doroshkevich 1970 , bardeen  1986 ) , and",
    "hence are expected to appear at the present epoch as even more non - spherical . in the context of",
    "the ` top - down ' hot dark matter scenario , zeldovich ( 1970 ) showed that pancake - like structures are the natural outcome of gravitational instability in the quasi - linear regime .",
    "further studies have indicated that a web of filaments could also form in hierarchical cold dark matter ( bottom - up ) scenarios ( e.g. bond , kofman & pogosyan 1996 ) , but the shapes look quite different in different scenarios , as a result of both initial conditions and the cosmic time which allows the perturbations to grow . hence , quantitative measures of the sgp and other observed filamentary structures and superclusters ( bahcall 1988 ) could be very important in distinguishing between models , e.g. by applying the shape statistic to both data and to @xmath7-body simulations .    here",
    "we study the properties of the sgp using the optical redshift survey ( ors , santiago  1995 ) which provides the most detailed and uniform optically - selected sample of the local galaxy density field to date . for comparison",
    ", we also use the full - sky redshift survey of galaxies selected from the database of the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( ) , complete to 1.2 jy at 60@xmath17 m ( fisher  1995a ) . in this paper",
    "we consider the approach of ` moment of inertia ' ( moi ) to quantify a planar structure ( cf .",
    "babul & starkman 1992 ; luo & vishniac 1995 ; dave  1997 ; sathyaprakash  1998 ) .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the ors and   samples , while in section 3 we discuss the visual impression and preliminary analysis of the sgp .",
    "section 4 describes the formalism of the moi we also develop related statistics which are independent of the background determination .",
    "section 5 gives the results of moi when applied to the samples , and section 6 presents wiener reconstruction of the moi for .",
    "section 7 gives interpretation of the results using mock realizations , and conclusions and future work are discussed in section 8 .",
    "the optical redshift survey ( ors , santiago  1995 ) covers the sky at galactic latitude @xmath18 .",
    "the survey was drawn from the ugc ( nilson 1973 ) , eso ( lauberts 1982 ) , and esgc ( corwin & skiff 1995 ) galaxy catalogues , and it contains two subsets : one complete to a blue photographic magnitude of 14.5 , and the other complete to a blue major diameter of 1.9 arcmin .",
    "the entire sample consists of 8457 galaxies , with redshifts available for 98% of them ; @xmath19 new redshifts were measured to complete the survey .",
    "the high number density of galaxies in ors makes it ideal for cosmographical studies of the local universe .",
    "as ors only covers @xmath20 , we filled in the zone of avoidance ( zoa ) at @xmath21 with galaxies from the   1.2 jy survey ( fisher  1995a ) .",
    "the zone of avoidance in , @xmath22 , was filled by interpolation based on the observed galaxy distribution below and above the zoa ( yahil  1991 ) . while in principle",
    "it is possible to interpolate for the ors",
    "zoa , e.g. by hand or using a wiener reconstruction ( lahav  1994 ) , we prefer to include real structure as probed by   even at the price of mixing two different data sets .",
    "hereafter when we refer to the ors sample we mean that supplemented by the  1.2 jy galaxies at @xmath21 .    due to galactic extinction and the diversity of catalogues used , the selection function of ors depends on both distance and direction ( santiago  1996 ) . in order to account for these selection effects ,",
    "a weight is usually associated with each galaxy . for a uniform survey like  ( see below ) the selection function @xmath23 depends only on the distance to a galaxy , @xmath24 , and hence the weight is simply @xmath25 where the mean number density of galaxies is estimated by @xmath26 ( see davis & huchra 1982 for an alternative minimum variance estimator of the mean density ) .    for ors ,",
    "we follow santiago  ( 1996 ) and hermit  ( 1996 ) and weight each galaxy by : @xmath27 where @xmath17 labels the catalogue from which the galaxy in question is drawn ; each of the four catalogues making up the ors has its own mean density @xmath28 . here",
    "@xmath29 is the mean number density of  galaxies in the volume corresponding to the @xmath17-th catalogue in ors .",
    "this brings each of the subsamples , with their separate selection criteria , to a uniform weighting ( santiago 1996 ) . with the weighting of equation ( 1 ) or ( 3 )",
    ", we can thus calculate the galaxy density _ fluctuation field _",
    "@xmath30 throughout the volume surveyed .",
    "for comparison we also apply our analysis to the complete   1.2 jy sample ( fisher  1995a ; strauss  1992 ) , which includes 5313 galaxies over 87.6 % of the sky .",
    "the zoa in   was interpolated according to the yahil  ( 1991 ) procedure mentioned above .",
    "hereafter we refer to this sample as the   sample .",
    "we note that the ors and  samples are not really independent ; roughly 60% of the  1.2 jy galaxies out to @xmath1 are also catalogued in the ors magnitude limited sample .",
    "we work purely in local group redshift space , except in section 6 on wiener reconstruction .",
    "historically , the sgp was identified in projected 2-d maps .",
    "we used the  sample ( which is homogeneous over the sky ) to revisit the 2-d appearance of the sgp by fitting the data to a great circle . for a projected distribution of sources the great circle along which",
    "the density of galaxies is enhanced can be found by calculating the covariance matrix : @xmath31 where the cartesian axes @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) are defined for a unit sphere .",
    "the matrix @xmath34 can be diagonalised ( cf .",
    "section 4.2 ) and the smallest eigen - vector indicates the direction of the normal to the great circle .",
    "we considered the projected  galaxy distribution out to @xmath35 and @xmath1 , and found that the great circle is aligned with the standard de vaucouleurs sgp to within @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively .",
    "can we see the translation of the great circle to a plane in 3-dimensions ?",
    "figure  [ sgp_xyz ] shows the raw distributions , uncorrected for selection effects of ors and galaxies in a sphere of radius of @xmath35 projected on the standard ( @xmath38-@xmath39 ) , ( @xmath38-@xmath40 ) and ( @xmath40-@xmath39 ) planes .",
    "the sgp is particularly visible edge - on in the ( @xmath38-@xmath39 ) and ( @xmath40-@xmath39 ) projections .",
    "we note that the structures seen in ors and  are quite similar , but the ors map is much denser , and clusters are more prominent .",
    "maps of the smoothed density field , after applying the appropriate weights , are shown elsewhere for the  survey ( saunders  1991 ; strauss  1992 ; fisher  1995b ; strauss & willick 1995 ; webster , lahav & fisher 1997 ) and for ors ( santiago  1995 , 1996 ; baker  1998 ) . in figures  [ ors_sgz ] and  [ iras_sgz ] we show histograms of the galaxy density field @xmath41 , corrected for selection effects , as a function of @xmath39 , averaged over @xmath38 and @xmath40 , within spheres of ever - larger radii , as indicated in each panel .",
    "the sgp is seen as an enhancement at @xmath42 in these plots to roughly @xmath43 , but is not apparent on larger scales .",
    "our visual impression is that there is indeed a flattened structure in the galaxy distribution , aligned along @xmath42 , extending to appreciable redshifts . to quantify this",
    "we calculate the overdensity @xmath44 as a function of @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is evaluated within a circular cylinder centered on the local group with radius @xmath45 and height along sgz of @xmath0 , and the mean density @xmath47 is calculated within a sphere of radius @xmath45 ( _ including _ the slab ) .",
    "this overdensity reaches a maximum at @xmath48 ( for which the volume of the slab is @xmath49 ) , @xmath50 and @xmath51 for ors and , respectively . at @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 for ors and , respectively . for reference ,",
    "the rms fluctuations in cubes of volume @xmath55 are @xmath56 and @xmath57 for optical ( stromlo / apm ) and  ( 1.2 jy ) surveys , respectively ( efstathiou 1993 ) .",
    "hence the fluctuation in galaxy counts in a slab aligned with the standard de vaucouleurs sgp is no more than @xmath58 perturbation on scale of @xmath6 .",
    "this implies that the sgp is only a modest perturbation on these large scales .",
    "the overdensity as a function of the @xmath4 component of the standard sgp is depicted in figures 2 and 3 .      in order to quantify the local overdensity",
    ", we need to calculate the centre of ` mass ' of the density field , within a sphere of radius @xmath45 centred on us , for both the ors and   samples ( cf .",
    ", juszkiewicz  1990 ) .",
    "the centre of mass is given by summing over the galaxies ( assuming they all have equal mass ) : @xmath59 where @xmath33 , @xmath60 is the total volume of the sphere of radius @xmath45 and @xmath61 is the weight per galaxy described in  2 .",
    "the shot noise error in each axis is @xmath62 where the last equality is valid for an isotropic distribution .",
    "figure  [ distc ] shows the coordinates of the centre of the galaxy distribution as a function of @xmath45 .",
    "the centre moves away from the origin ( the local group ) by no more than @xmath63 for ors and @xmath64 for .",
    "this is partially due to the ` tug of war ' between the great attractor and perseus - pisces , which largely balance each other out .",
    "indeed , the centre moves back towards the origin for @xmath65 .",
    "both visual impression of and a formal @xmath66 fit suggest that the sgp can not be fitted by a homogeneous ellipsoid model .",
    "we therefore seek a more objective measure of deviation from sphericity , via the moment of inertia tensor ( moi ) .",
    "we wish to detect a high density planar structure ( e.g. a slab or an ellipsoid ) embedded in a uniform sphere of radius @xmath45 .",
    "one approach ( cf .",
    "babul & starkman 1992 , luo & vishniac 1995 , dave  1997 ) is to construct the moi for the _ fluctuation _ in the density field : @xmath67 c_ij = c_ij - |c_ij = ( x_i - |x_i ) ( x_j - |x_j ) dv , ( 6 ) @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the galaxy number density at position @xmath69 , @xmath47 is the mean number density and @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) are cartesian components of @xmath69 .",
    "note that we allow the centre @xmath72 to move ( see figure  4 ) , although below , we will end up keeping it fixed .",
    "the integration is over the volume of the sphere .",
    "we define the fluctuations in the density field relative to the _ background _",
    "density @xmath73 in the absence of the slab ( which differs from the mean density @xmath47 _ including _ the slab ) .    for a uniform distribution with density @xmath47",
    "the covariance matrix is analytic and isotropic : @xmath74    @xmath75 where @xmath76 @xmath77 is of course zero , and @xmath78 is the kronecker delta function .    for a discrete density field , such as provided by ors or  , we can calculate the covariance elements by summing over the galaxies :    @xmath79 where we have set @xmath80 , given the fact that the centre of mass stays so close to the origin ( figure  4 ) .",
    "an analytic estimator for poisson shot - noise per diagonal component of the covariance matrix ( assuming no errors in @xmath81 ) is : @xmath82    eq .",
    "( 9 ) requires knowledge of @xmath81 in order to correct for the background density .",
    "however , as the boundaries of the sgp are hard to define _ a priori _ and the background will not be uniform , it is difficult to estimate a meaningful @xmath81 . in ",
    "4.3 we suggest a statistic which is independent of this parameter .",
    "the next step in our analysis is to diagonalize the moi and find the eigenvalues @xmath83 and associated eigenvectors @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) : @xmath86 the standard deviation ( ` 1-@xmath16 ' ) along each of the three axes is given by @xmath87 , which we label hereafter as @xmath88 .",
    "note that since the background contribution ( the last term in eq .",
    "9 ) is isotropic , it only affects the eigenvalues , but not the directions of the eigenvectors .",
    "this procedure is essentially the principal component analysis ( pca ) - a well known statistical tool for reducing the dimensionality of parameter space ( e.g. murtagh & heck 1987 and references therein ) . by identifying the _ linear _ combination of input parameters with maximum variance",
    ", pca determines the principal components that can be most effectively used to characterize the input data . in our case , in searching for a plane , we wish to see if the pca finds one axis to be much shorter than the other two axes .",
    "our aim is to quantify deviations from spherical structure .",
    "the difficulty in doing so is due to two problems : ( i ) the background density as modeled above with @xmath81 is ill - determined , and ( ii ) the shot noise due to the finite number of galaxies can be quite large .",
    "we will discuss the shot noise problem in  6 below . to overcome the problem of the unknown background , we can construct the following quantities which are independent of @xmath81 : @xmath89    @xmath90 and @xmath91 for a perfect sphere , @xmath92 . for a homogeneous oblate ellipsoid with semi - major axes @xmath93 ,",
    "one expects @xmath94 for all @xmath45 , but for @xmath95 and @xmath96 to increase out to @xmath97 and then to decline .",
    "note that the @xmath98 here are in the diagonalized pca frame , where the axes are ordered by size ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "alternatively , we can calculate @xmath98 along fixed @xmath100 axes ( e.g. in de vaucouleurs system ) by replacing @xmath101 in eqs .",
    "( 12 - 14 ) by the non - ordered variances in that fixed coordinate system ( i.e. the diagonal elements in the moi matrix in that @xmath100 coordinate system ) .",
    "in the limit that the errors are isotropic the poisson error bars are : @xmath102 and similarly for @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "we will determine the characteristic shape of the galaxy density field , from the observed @xmath103 and @xmath96 and their error bars as a function of @xmath45 .",
    "we note that other transformations of @xmath104 are possible , such as the @xmath105 statistic proposed by babul & starkman ( 1992 ) .      to get an insight into our @xmath98 statistic we applied it to mock realizations of ellipsoids placed in a uniform background .",
    "the selection function was applied to the mock samples , and the results were averaged over 100 realizations .",
    "figure  [ elips ] shows the quantities @xmath106 , and @xmath96 derived at fixed axes for mock ellipsoids ( oblate , prolate and triaxial ) with dimensions indicated in the panels and overdensity of @xmath107 . when the axes were allowed to be chosen by pca , the axes agreed with the correct orientation of the ellipsoids to within @xmath37 ( rms over 100 realizations ) . for a single realization",
    "the curves are much more noisy . moreover , if pca defines the axes , it attempts to maximize the differences between the axes , and the results for @xmath106 , and @xmath96 are biased by noise .",
    "for example , in the case of a perfectly oblate structure in the presence of noise , the quantity @xmath96 increases with radius @xmath45 , where it is identically zero in the noise - free case .",
    "fortunately , we will see in the following section that the behaviour of @xmath98 for the real data is quite robust .",
    "we will continue these experiments with the mock realizations in  7 , where we consider more complex geometries .",
    "we now apply the moi approach to the ors and  samples .",
    "we begin by considering @xmath108 and @xmath96 along _ fixed _ axes . we will find below that the pca direction at small @xmath45 is indeed very close to that of de vaucouleurs system , so we simply choose the standard de vaucouleurs sgp axes .",
    "figure 6 shows @xmath103 and @xmath96 ( derived here from the variances along the standard sgp axes without ordering them , as explained in section 4.3 ) as a function of @xmath45 .",
    "the most notable feature is the dip in @xmath96 at about @xmath109 in both samples .",
    "this is due to the dumbbell - like configuration of perseus - pisces and the great attractor on opposite sides of the sky , as we ll see in  7 .",
    "but at @xmath110 , the structure is pancake - like : @xmath111 tends to small values ( in particular in ors ) , more in line with the visual impression of a pancake - like structure in figure  1 .",
    "the dramatic changes with @xmath45 ( in particular at @xmath112 ) call to question the notion of a single coherent feature within the boundaries of our samples ( see  7 ) . based on figure 6",
    ", one may argue that the ` plane ' terminates at @xmath6 .",
    "we now turn to the pca approach of diagonalizing the moi derived at each radius @xmath45 . in this case",
    "the axes change direction , and might even ` swap ' .",
    "swapping means that an axis which is the largest at a given @xmath45 may become say the second or third largest in a different @xmath45 .",
    "hence we may see a discontinuity in the variation of the ` largest ' axis with @xmath45 .",
    "the variation at large @xmath45 is more difficult to interpret , but we see that @xmath113 , implying a triaxial shape , and @xmath111 and @xmath95 increase with @xmath45 . in contrast , the toy models ( figure 5 ) show that two of @xmath114 $ ] drop with @xmath45 beyond the radius which encloses the ellipsoid ( @xmath1 in the toy models ) . but in making this comparison with figure 5 we should keep in mind that at large @xmath45 the increase of the observed quantities @xmath103 or @xmath96 might be due to shot - noise .",
    "it is also interesting to note the similarity between ors and , indicating that on the very large scales the density fields in the two samples are quite similar .",
    "table 1 lists @xmath88 , their poisson errors , and the direction of the pca @xmath4 component for ors ( for direct summation ) and  ( for both direct summation and wiener reconstruction described in the next section ) . table 1 also lists the values in _ differential _ shells , showing trends similar to those seen in the cumulative plots .",
    "fig 9 shows the variation of direction of the pca @xmath4 component with @xmath45 .",
    "we see that although the angle @xmath115 between the pca minor axis and de vaucouleurs pole is usually less than @xmath116 , there is a significant variation on the sky ( relative to the errors of @xmath117 due to shot noise ) . particularly noticeable",
    "is the big jump at @xmath118 , in accord with the behaviour in figures 6,7 and 8 .",
    "this is again due to the dumbbell configuration of the great attractor and the perseus - pisces superclusters , as we shall see in  7 .",
    "table 1 also gives @xmath119 , the complement of the misalignment angle @xmath120 , for 3 shells , each 20  wide .",
    "we see that indeed typically @xmath3 , even at the ( 60 - 80 )  shell , which is beyond the great attractor and perseus - pisces .",

    "no errors are given in the wiener case , as this is a smoothed field ( although one can calculate the scatter around the mean ) .",
    "@xmath129 and @xmath119 ( both in degrees ) give the direction in standard de vaucouleurs coordinates of the @xmath4 component as found by pca .",
    "the angle between this direction and de vaucouleurs sgp pole is simply @xmath130 .",
    "in addition to the problem of shot - noise , the density field measured from redshift surveys also suffers from redshift distortions due to peculiar velocities ( see hamilton 1998 for a review ) .",
    "one approach which deals with both problems is wiener filtering ( e.g. lahav  1994 , fisher  1995b ) . in particular , fisher  ( 1995b ) expanded the density field @xmath131 in terms of spherical harmonics and bessel functions . by assuming a prior model for the power spectrum ,",
    "the coefficients of the expansion can be corrected for the redshift distortion and for the shot - noise .",
    "this reconstruction is optimal in the minimum variance sense . in this approach",
    ", the smoothed density field approaches the mean density at large distances .",
    "this does not mean necessarily that the sgp itself disappears at large distances ; it merely reflects our ignorance of the density field where the data are poor .",
    "this wiener approach applied to the density field @xmath41 also gives the optimal reconstruction for any property which is linear in @xmath41 .",

    "we apply this technique below to the reconstructed , real - space density field of  galaxies , assuming as priors @xmath138 , normalization @xmath139 and a cdm power spectrum with shape parameter @xmath140 .",

    "figure 11 shows the variation of the minor pca axis with @xmath45 .",
    "there is good agreement with the results of direct summation shown in figure 9 , indicating that shot noise and redshift distortion do not introduce big systematic effects in our statistics .",
    "unfortunately , the wiener procedure can not easily be applied to the ors sample , as it only covers @xmath18 .",
    "the behaviour of the moi axes ( figures 6 - 10 ) for both ors and  indicate that the sgp is a structure far more complicated than a homogeneous ellipsoid or a slab . in the local universe",
    "there is ` contamination ' due to clusters and voids below and above the sgp . to get further insight to the structure that generates the observed moi , we generated mock realizations of the  sample with more complicated geometries than the simple ellipsoids used in  4.4 , trying to mimic the significant overdensities seen in the real universe . in particular",
    ", we put in : ( i ) an ellipsoid with dimensions of @xmath141 and overdensity @xmath142 aligned with the supergalactic plane , ( ii ) a sphere of radius @xmath143 and overdensity @xmath144 , representing a virgo - like cluster at @xmath145 , ( iii ) a sphere of radius @xmath146 and overdensity @xmath147 , representing a perseus - pisces - like supercluster at @xmath148 , and ( iv ) a sphere of radius @xmath149 and overdensity @xmath147 , representing a great attractor - like structure at @xmath150 .",

    "for example we see that the dips in @xmath96 at @xmath151 @xmath112 in the real data ( figure 6 ) are reproduced here ( albeit with not quite the same amplitudes ) , especially with fixed axes .",
    "this toy example illustrates that the observed behaviour of @xmath106 , and @xmath96 can be accounted for by adding few major superclusters to a pancake - like structure .",
    "we note that the toy model in figure 12 does not reproduce the observed growth of @xmath103 and @xmath96 on large scales , which might be due to shot noise .",
    "we note that recent simulations for a variety of models ( e.g. , bond  1996 , jenkins  1998 ) show a web of filaments and sheets , with ` knots ' at their intersection , or alternatively , ` arms stretching from clusters ' .",
    "it may well be that perseus - pisces and the great attractor represent such knots .",
    "hence the moi ` shape - finder ' statistic , when applied to many points in space , could be an efficient way of detecting such patterns and discriminating between models .",
    "we have presented a moment of inertia approach to study the existence and extent of the planar structure in the local galaxy density field , the supergalactic plane ( sgp ) .",
    "\\(ii ) the moments of inertia analysis of the galaxy density field shows that the normal to the plane is within @xmath152 of the standard sgp z - axis , out to a radius of 80 , for both ors and .",
    "however , the normal changes direction with @xmath45 , in particular at @xmath5 , due to the presence of perseus - pisces and the great attractor .",
    "the shape too varies with @xmath45 , and in fact at @xmath112 the sgp looks more like a dumbbell than a pancake .",
    "based on figures 6 , 7 and 10 one may argue that the plane terminates at @xmath6 . however , we note that the axes the shell @xmath153 are aligned with the standard sgp to within @xmath116 .",
    "\\(v ) an optimal minimum variance reconstruction ( wiener filtering in spherical harmonics representation ) , which corrects  for both redshift distortion and shot noise , yields similar misalignment of angle and axes .",
    "\\(vi ) it may well be that perseus - pisces and the great attractor represent ` knots ' in a web of filaments and sheets , as seen in recent @xmath7-body simulations .",
    "this complicated structure calls to question the notion of a single coherent feature on gpc scales ( as claimed e.g. by tully 1987 , 1987 ) , and the possible connectivity between the great attractor and the shapley supercluster at @xmath155 ( e.g. scaramella  1992 ) .    regarding the wider cosmological implications , the present analysis is as an example of applying the moi at only one point , centred at us .",
    "it is of interest to compare the sgp to other structures , e.g. the great walls seen in the cfa and ssrs surveys .",
    "one can calculate moments of inertia at many points in space and contrast the statistical behaviour of the axes with @xmath7-body simulations .",
    "results from volume limited subsets of @xmath7-body simulations show indeed that the moi statistic quantifies e.g. differences in filamentary structure between cold and hot dark matter models ( e.g. dave  1997 , webster 1998 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the flux limited ors and  catalogues are too shallow to apply the statistic in other points in space .",
    "volume limited subsets from new large redshift surveys ( e.g. 2df and sdss ) would be suitable for such shape - finding algorithms .",
    "it also is possible to improve the above analysis by calculating the moment of inertia for a pre - selected region above a certain density - threshold",
    ". it would also be interesting to repeat the analysis for different morphological types and weighting schemes ; for example , by calculating luminosity - weighted , rather than number weighted galaxy counts . on the statistical side , other more general shape - finders can be applied , e.g. by utilizing the minkowski functions ( e.g. mecke , buchert & wagner 1994 ; sahni , sathyaprakash & shandarin 1998 ) .",
