    "<S> the x - ray measurements , performed on a cleaved , single - layered perovskite , la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 , reveal that while the crystallographic surface is atomically smooth , the orbital ` surface ' is much rougher , with an r.m.s . </S>",

    "<S> the temperature dependence of this scattering shows evidence of a surface - induced second order transition .    </S>",
    "<S> an issue destined to be of increasing importance in the science of correlated - electrons systems in the coming years is the question of whether the electronic behaviour , such as charge , orbital or spin order , is different at a surface or interface compared to the bulk of the material . </S>",
    "<S> this question is of central importance from an applied perspective  any device one fabricates from these materials will require electron transport across an interface ; from a nanoscience perspective  nanoscaled objects are defined by their very large surface - to - volume ratio ; and from a fundamental perspective  understanding the role of reduced dimensionality in determining the electronic behaviour of such systems is a key component in understanding the general problem of strongly correlated electron systems .    in many ways </S>",
    "<S> manganites represent an ideal system to address the role of the surface , because all the relevant degrees of freedom  charge , spin and orbital  play an active role in determining the ground state . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , they are exquisitely sensitive to perturbations , and hence , might be expected to exhibit relatively large surface effects . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , while the vast majority of experimental work has focused on bulk properties@xcite , the very few surface sensitive studies do suggest that the surface of a manganite may be quite different from the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the measurements of freeland _ et al._@xcite showed that the top bilayer of a cleaved surface of a ferromagnetic bilayered manganite is magnetically dead , though the second bilayer has full bulk magnetic order . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the half - doped single - layer manganite , which is known to exhibit bulk orbital order below @xmath4  k , showed no superlattice reflection corresponding to such ordering down to 80  k , when probed with surface - sensitive leed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , there is evidence that the surface of manganite crystals may exhibit different electronic phases than the bulk  a phenomena that has been coined ` electronic reconstruction'@xcite in analogy with more traditional surface science studies of atomic reconstruction driven by surface energetics .    in this paper , we present the first study of orbital order at a surface , utilizing surface x - ray scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of using x - ray scattering in this endeavour is that it provides information on both the electronic surface ( specifically , atomic displacements associated with orbital order ) and the chemical surface , separately . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that the abrupt truncation of a sample by its surface gives rise to rod - shaped x - ray scattering around the bragg reflections , the so - called crystal truncation rods ( ctr ) . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity profiles of such rods provide detailed , quantitative information about the chemical surface@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similarly then , the abrupt termination of orbital order by a surface should give rise to orbital truncation rods ( otr ) running through the orbital superlattice peaks . </S>",
    "<S> these would allow one to quantify the surface orbital order . here , we present the first observation of such orbital truncation rod scattering . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to quantitatively probe the orbital order in the vicinity of the surface . </S>",
    "<S> working with a freshly cleaved la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 , we show that the orbital order has a significantly rougher interface than the chemical surface and a shorter correlation length than in the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> these results imply that the surface order parameter is reduced relative to the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> further , the temperature dependence of the surface orbital order suggests that the surface exhibits a more continuous transition than the bulk ordering transition . taken together </S>",
    "<S> , these results demonstrate that the surface is a significant perturbation in regard to the electronic phenomena of orbital ordering and point to the need for an improved theoretical understanding of how the surface couples to such electronic orders .    </S>",

    "<S> single crystal samples of la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 , which has the layered perovskite structure shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the samples were then either cleaved perpendicular to the @xmath5-axis in he and placed in a sealed he - filled can , or cleaved in air , and put into a closed - cycle refrigerator . </S>",

    "<S> similarly , scattering originating from the surface of the orbital ordering must be present in ` orbital truncation rods '  rods of scattering along the same direction but through the superlattice reflections related to the orbital order , i.e. ( @xmath13 ) where ( @xmath14 ) is the orbital ordering wave - vector@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> surface scattered intensity will be enhanced at @xmath28 , the critical angle for total reflection , as a result of the interference between the incident and the scattered waves of the photon@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the inset to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : oo - ctr](a ) shows the scattered intensity as a function of @xmath23 at the bulk orbital superlattice reflection ( @xmath21 ) and on the nominal otr at ( @xmath22 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity at ( @xmath22 ) has a maximum around @xmath24 while a smooth increase is seen at ( @xmath21 ) with increasing @xmath23 , a result of the fact that more of the beam is intercepted by the sample at higher angles . </S>",
    "<S> since the exit angle @xmath29 for ( @xmath22 ) is 3 to 1.5 degrees in this scan region , the observed intensity maximum can not be due to a maximum in the sample illumination and detector acceptance , which happens at @xmath30 in our experimental configuration . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we conclude that the scattering observed at ( 2 0 0.2)@xmath7(@xmath15 ) , shown in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : oo - ctr ] ( a ) does indeed come from surface scattering and not from stacking faults or other bulk effects . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first such observation of the orbital truncation rod scattering .    </S>",
    "<S> having established that such scattering originates from the truncation of the orbital order , we next discuss what can be learned from this new scattering . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : oo - ctr ] ( a ) , the transverse scan profile of the rod intensity for the chemical surface and for the orbital surface are quite different . </S>",
    "<S> this difference in the scattering profiles directly reflects a difference in the surface roughness.@xcite the sharp single peak observed for the chemical ctr scattering implies a very flat surface , and is consistent with the atomically smooth chemical surface observed in the afm picture ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : chem_sur ] ( b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the transverse profile of the orbital truncation rod exhibits two components ; a ` sharp ' one and a ` broad ' one . </S>",
    "<S> such a line shape is expected when a surface  in this case the orbital surface  has a well - defined average position ( a flat plane ) but local , finite deviations from this average@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , without recourse to any model - dependent fitting we can immediately conclude from the data of fig.[fig : oo - ctr ] ( a ) that there exists a flat chemical surface and a rougher orbital order surface .    </S>",
    "<S> a rougher surface also has the consequence that the intensity along the truncation rod must fall more sharply as a function of @xmath9 than for a less rough surface . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : oo - ctr ] ( b ) shows the intensity of the ( 20@xmath9 ) and ( @xmath25 ) rods as a function of @xmath9 measured on two samples ( cleaved in he , sample a , and in air , sample b ) at 100k , 170k , and 200k . for the orbital rod , </S>",
    "<S> the intensity of the sharp component integrated in the transverse direction is shown . </S>",
    "<S> note , the @xmath9-dependence of the ( 20@xmath9 ) intensity of sample a is slightly different from that of sample b , suggesting a slightly different degree of flatness of the chemical surface for the two samples . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the ( @xmath25 ) intensity distribution for both samples is very similar and in both cases , the slope is steeper than that along ( 20@xmath9 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the result in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : oo - ctr ] ( a ) : the orbital order surface is rougher than the chemical surface .    </S>",
    "<S> we next quantify this result by use of a model for a nearly flat surface due to andrews and cowley@xcite . in this model , the surface is characterized by two parameters : @xmath31 , the standard deviation of the surface height , and @xmath32 , the correlation length of the surface ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : analysis ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the truncation rod intensity distribution @xmath33 from such a surface is given by : @xmath34 ^ 2}{\\sigma^2q_z^4 }   \\nonumber\\\\&&\\times                \\exp\\left[\\frac{-(\\xi^{\\scriptsize { \\rm sur}})^2[1-\\exp(-\\sigma^2q_z^2)]}{4\\sigma^2q_z^2}(h^2+k^2)\\right],\\label{eq : ib}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the intensities for the sharp component and the broad component respectively , @xmath37 is the structure factor at scattering vector @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is the @xmath5 * -component of the reduced wavevector ( e.g. this is @xmath40 for @xmath41 ) . in order to compare our data to the predictions of this model </S>",
    "<S> , we replace the delta - function in equation ( [ eq : is ] ) with a gaussian , to account for the finite bulk orbital correlation length , and fit the transverse scans to a two - gaussian lineshape as shown by the red solid curve in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath9-dependence of the parameters derived from these fits are shown in figure [ fig : analysis](a ) , which plots the ratio of the intensity of the broad component and the sharp component , and in figure [ fig : analysis](b ) , which shows the widths of the two components , for the 170  k data set .    . </S>",

    "<S> ( b ) peak widths of broad- and sharp- component . calculated values for the model discussed in the text are shown by solid lines in both figures.,width=264 ]    the intensity ratio @xmath42 increases rapidly with @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> this ratio depends mainly on @xmath31 , and hence @xmath31 may be obtained from the plot . the solid line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : analysis](a ) shows the expected behaviour for @xmath27 , which reproduces the data quite well . </S>",
    "<S> note , this same value of @xmath31 is also consistent with the results shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : oo - ctr ] ( b ) ; the solid line in this latter figure is the calculated intensity distribution given by taking the product of the measured @xmath43 and @xmath44 , with @xmath31=6.7 ; here , we assumed the chemical surface is perfectly flat . </S>",
    "<S> the in - plane correlation length @xmath32 is given by the transverse peak width and is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : analysis ] ( b ) as a function of @xmath9 , together with the @xmath9-dependence predicted by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : ib ] ) for a particular value of @xmath32 . using the value of @xmath27 , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath32 is found to be 120 . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the surface correlation length is much shorter than that of the bulk orbital order @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that some aspect of the surface disrupts the orbital order . </S>",
    "<S> this may be due to differing surface energetics resulting from the reduced coordination , or perhaps varying sr concentrations at the site of the cleave .    </S>",
    "<S> we next compare the present results to that of previous reports . </S>",
    "<S> leed measurements on the same material @xcite showed no superlattice intensity down to 80k , implying little orbital order is established in the topmost layer . </S>",
    "<S> our result is consistent with this study . </S>",
    "<S> the surface roughness in the orbital order observed here necessarily requires a small order parameter or a small ordered volume fraction at the surface . </S>",
    "<S> the same authors also performed stm measurements on the same system and found unidentified ` electronic roughness at the surface ' having an in - plane correlation length of several nanometres and surface roughness of 6 . comparing to the present results , </S>",
    "<S> one notes that the length scale of the roughness observed in the stm study is very similar to that of the orbital order interface observed in this study , and it is tempting to surmise that this ` electronic roughness ' may be related in some way to the rough orbital interface observed here . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions on this point without further study .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we briefly discuss the temperature dependence of the orbital truncation rod scattering . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : tdep ] shows the temperature dependence of the ( @xmath25)-sharp component intensity for @xmath462 , 0.2 , 0.3 , and 0.4 r.l.u .    ) </S>",
    "<S> -sharp component intensity for @xmath462 , 0.2 , 0.3 , and 0.4.,width=264 ]    the temperature dependence of the surface - sensitive otr scattering intensity ( @xmath9=0.2 , 0.3 and 0.4 data ) is different from that of the bulk - sensitive superlattice reflection . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk oo transition was reported to be ` probably second order ' with a relatively discontinuous transition@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the temperature dependence of the otr scattering intensity is seen to evolve much more continuously through the transition . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk superlattice reflection intensity is proportional to the volume of the orbitally ordered phase , and to the square of the order parameter , or the jahn - teller distortion caused by the orbital ordering . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the otr intensity is proportional to the area of the orbital ordered flat surface and to the square of the order parameter . since the surface roughness of the oo phase at 100k is the same as that at 200  k , then the change in intensity must be attributed to a change in the magnitude of the atomic displacement , i.e. , in the orbital order parameter at the surface . </S>",
    "<S> thus , these data suggest that the surface orbital order parameter decays more continuously than the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> such phenomena may be related to surface - induced second order phase transitions that have been observed in other materials@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> future work will investigate this possibility in detail .    in conclusion , we have performed a surface x - ray scattering study of a cleaved , single - layered , half - doped manganite . </S>",
    "<S> the chemical surface was found to be extremely flat with a la / sr layer termination . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , we have observed the scattering arising from truncation of the orbital order at a surface for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the orbital surface is rougher than the chemical surface , and that its temperature dependence is different from the bulk orbital order , indicating a surface - induced second order transition . </S>",
    "<S> these results are further evidence of the importance of surface effects in determining electronic ground states in strongly correlated systems and provide a direct route to probe such effects quantitatively . </S>",
    "<S> detailed understanding will require theoretical models capable of dealing with such surface effects explicitly . </S>"
