    "[ fig : e137 ] , we show regions of coupling and mass excluded by the lack of a signal at e137 , using the three different ways to calculate the differential cross section , @xmath128 .",
    "because of the exponential factor from decay and absorption lengths , the error in the exclusion plot due to making approximations to the cross section is smaller along the upper boundary , which is mainly determined by whether @xmath5 lives long enough to make it to the detector . with the ww approximation ,",
    "the 100% error in cross section causes an error of less than 20% along the lower boundary , and in a log - log plot across several scales , a 20% error is almost indistinguishable by eyesight . on the other hand , with the iww approximation , the difference is clearly visible when @xmath90 mev .",
    "we emphasize that the similarity of the exclusions with or without the approximations in a log - log plot means that the cross section approximations are good to the order of magnitude but the relative error can deviate at the @xmath88 level .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : e137 ] , we see that the absorption process , eq .

    "this is the trapping process due to the re - scattering @xmath130 the trapping process is expected to be as important as the absorption process in this example ( new scalar particle , beam dump e137 ) , and also cuts off the exclusion plot around @xmath129 .",

    ". therefore we do not include the trapping process in this example , but it might be crucial for other experiments .",
    "to further explore the accuracy of the approximations to the cross section , let us imagine that there is a signal of a new particle being produced at a beam dump experiment .",
    "in such a case , the mass and the coupling of this particle can be determined by examining the data , _",
    "i.e. _ , the distribution of events as a function of energy deposited in the detector .",
    "we perform 3 sets of pseudo - experiment by using the setup of e137 ; assume that the scalar boson exists with @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 , which are outside of the the current exclusion in fig .",
    "[ fig : e137 ] .",
    "we increase the incoming beam luminosities by 36 , 36 , and 137 times ( increasing the total number of electrons dumped into the the target ) , so that the expected total number of events is around 100 , 100 , and 400 .",
    "we assume that the resolution of the detector is 1 gev ( which means that there are 18 bins ) and generate the  observed \" number of events using a poisson distribution with the mean value from the complete calculation for each bin .",

    "we see that the `` true '' parameter values lie within the @xmath141 allowed regions when fitting with the complete calculation . on the other hand , although using approximation sometimes gives a fairly good estimate of cross section , the result of data fitting lies outside the @xmath0 range .",
    "it is worth noting that the shape of the @xmath141 or @xmath0 range is roughly along the exclusion boundary in fig .",
    "[ fig : e137 ] , because the exclusion boundary is the isocontour of the number of events .",
    "next , we consider another scenario of the third pseudo - experiment with @xmath135 . in this part of parameter space",
    ", the allowed coupling and mass can extend over roughly an order of magnitude . to illustrate the usefulness of the complete calculation , we perform fits to this data assuming that there is another experimental result that can sensitively measure the coupling .",
    "this would be the case if recently proposed experiments involving decays of radioactive nuclei underground see a nonzero signal  @xcite and we can use the beam dump experiment to determine the mass precisely . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that the other experiment measures the coupling with with negligible error . since there is one parameter to fit , the @xmath141 and @xmath0 range correspond to @xmath147 and @xmath149 .",
    "we show the results in fig . [",
    "fig : pseudo_exp_3_2 ] .",
    "again as expected , we see that the `` true '' parameter values lie within the @xmath141 allowed region when fitting with the complete calculation . using the approximations , the `` true '' mass lies outside the @xmath0 ranges .",
    "we observe that using the complete calculation could be crucial in measuring the mass of a new particle in this region of parameter space .",
    "our results are based on a new scalar boson motivated by proton radius puzzle  @xcite .",
    "however , we expect that the qualitative description remains similar in other type of particles , such as pseudoscalar and vector .",
    "while the production amplitude , decay length , and the absorption length can differ in detail for particles with different quantum numbers , they are qualitatively similar .",
    "the approximations that we have examined deal with the phase space integral and coupling to electromagnetism of the target nucleus .",
    "therefore , we expect similar results to hold for other bosons as in the scalar case .",
    "the similarity of our exclusion plot to the vector case @xcite provides evidence in favor of this ( including a coupling to the muon can change the situation for @xmath150  @xcite due to the opening of a new channel with typically a substantial partial width ) .",
    "there are some other beam dump experiments using cherenkov detector , such as e141 @xcite and orsay @xcite , so that their exclusion plot do not extend to the region where @xmath151 .",
    "we show the beam dump experiments e141 and orsay in @xcite .",
    "in this work , we present a complete calculation of the beam dump experiment .",
    "we show that using ww approximation can be trusted to the order of magnitude in the cross section and exclusion plot .",
    "however , as we illustrated with several pseudo - experiments in a range of masses , in the event of a nonzero signal , a complete calculation can give very different results from the approximations .",

    "<S> beam dump experiments have been aimed at searching for new particles or putting constraint limits on their existence by comparing null results with expectations based on the cross section calculated using the weizsacker - williams ( ww ) and other approximations to simplify the phase space integral and amplitude calculation . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the validity of the widely used ww approximation along with other popular assumptions . using scalar boson production as an example , we perform the complete calculation to obtain the cross section and the resulting number of particles produced without such approximations , apply these results to exclusion plot and data fitting , and examine the error when using these commonly used approximations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that there could be more than 100% errors in cross sections and 20% errors in exclusion plot boundaries for certain parameters . in the event of a discovery , the mass and coupling of the new boson </S>",
    "<S> as determined by the approximate and exact calculations could differ at more than the @xmath0 level . </S>"
