    "many investigations , both analytical and numerical , have been undertaken to elucidate the localization problem of non - interacting electrons in random magnetic fields ( rmf ) ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the rmf model has been proposed for studying the quantum hall effect with landau level filling @xmath2 where the system of quasi - particles may be viewed as a fermi liquid like metal . in a mean field approximation",
    "these composite fermions @xcite are subject to a fluctuating local magnetic field with zero mean .",
    "however , up to now , no satisfactory agreement has been reached on the question , whether or not a metal - insulator transition exists in the thermodynamic limit . in recent numerical studies @xcite ,",
    "current carrying states have been reported for a rmf model including additional random disorder potentials .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite report that a metal - insulator transition has been detected in the band center at a critical disorder @xmath3 by making use of the topological properties of the wave functions .",
    "the method of calculating the topological quantum number ( chern number ) of the one - electron wave functions , which has proven to be a useful tool in the integer quantum hall effect @xcite , considerably restricts the achievable system size , @xmath4 . on the other hand ,",
    "using the method of energy - level statistics @xcite , system sizes of more than a factor of 10 larger are accessible . in this method ,",
    "the knowledge of the eigenfunctions is not necessary , because the information about localized , critical or extended states is gained from the spectral correlations .",
    "therefore , we report here on an independent check of whether the extended states found in ref.@xcite can really be expected in the thermodynamic limit or if their result must be attributed to finite size effects .",
    "a one - band tight - binding model is used to describe non - interacting particles moving in two dimensions in the presence of spatially fluctuating magnetic fields . @xmath5",
    "the @xmath6 are a complete set of lattice vectors connected with the sites of a square lattice with linear size @xmath7 and lattice constant @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is taken as the unit of energy .",
    "the sum runs over nearest neighbors only .",
    "the phases @xmath10 along the bonds are chosen such that the corresponding magnetic fluxes per plaquette , @xmath11 , are distributed according to @xmath12 with probability density @xmath13 .",
    "the strength of the flux was taken to be @xmath14 .",
    "the diagonal disorder potentials @xmath15 are chosen at random from an interval @xmath16 $ ] with uniform distribution , @xmath17 .",
    "we considered system sizes @xmath18 in the range 20 to 200 and disorder values @xmath19 between 1.5 and 3.5 .",
    "the energy eigenvalues within a small range ( @xmath20 ) in the middle of the tight - binding band are calculated using a lanczos algorithm . for each pair of parameters ( @xmath21 ) about 250000",
    "eigenvalues are accumulated taking different realizations of the disorder potentials .",
    "we carefully checked that the results were independent of the width of the energy interval chosen .",
    "8.cm    from the unfolded energy eigenvalues the nearest neighbor level spacing distribution @xmath1 is calculated , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the mean level spacing . for infinite systems",
    "it is known from random matrix theory ( rmt ) @xcite that in the metallic regime @xmath1 is close to the wigner surmise , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 reflects the symmetry of the system : orthogonal ( @xmath26 ) , unitary ( @xmath27 ) , and symplectic ( @xmath28 ) . in the insulating case",
    "the spacings of the uncorrelated eigenvalues are well described by the poisson probability density distribution @xmath29 .    in finite systems ,",
    "when the correlation length exceeds the system size , one expects a hybrid @xcite of the wigner and the poisson form which eventually tends to the limiting true metallic case , if @xmath30 , or to a complete insulating behavior , if @xmath31 , as the system size is increased , @xmath32 . for disorder strength @xmath33 close to the critical value",
    "@xmath34 various new scale independent distributions have been discovered recently in several systems @xcite that exhibit a metal - insulator - transition or at least a critical point .",
    "in the 2d random flux model with additional diagonal disorder potentials , we find for small @xmath0 , @xmath35 , as expected for broken time reversal symmetry ( unitary ) .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows only the large - s behavior of @xmath1 for a disorder strength @xmath36 , which is smaller than the proposed critical disorder @xmath37 , and for system sizes @xmath38 , 40 , 100 , and 200 .",
    "the rmt result for the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) which holds in the metallic case and the poisson result applicable for the uncorrelated eigenvalues of the localized states are also plotted .",
    "increasing the system size shifts the curves away from the hybrid @xmath1 towards the @xmath39 decay of the localized states .",
    "hence , even for @xmath33 smaller than the suggested critical @xmath40 , all the states still tend to localization in the limit @xmath41 .",
    "8.cm    to be more quantitative , we have calculated the number @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the probability that a given energy interval @xmath0 contains exactly @xmath44 eigenvalues , and @xmath45 . in the metallic regime",
    ", a value @xmath46 is known for infinite systems from rmt while for localized states @xmath47 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] @xmath48 is shown for different system sizes and disorder strength",
    ". the values clearly increase with increasing @xmath18 , at least for @xmath49 .",
    "this indicates localized states at the band center for this disorder range .",
    "a weak decrease of @xmath48 is still found for smaller disorder strength , but no size dependence could be observed anymore , because in that case the localization length considerably exceeds our largest system size @xmath50 .",
    "it is possible to use @xmath48 also as a scaling variable , a procedure which was exploited recently @xcite to determine the critical exponent of the correlation function at the metal - insulator - transition ( mit ) in a 2d symplectic system . for the rmf model",
    "we have tested the validity of the single parameter hypothesis @xmath51 of a finite size scaling analysis which was performed for the data showing a size dependence @xmath52 .",
    "the result is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] where only a single branch of the scaling function can be seen which excludes the existence of a mit for the disorder strengths investigated .",
    "8.cm    the disorder dependence of the scaling parameter @xmath53 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] in comparison with the result for a conventional 2d anderson model without random magnetic fields .",
    "since the prefactor @xmath54 was not determined in our calculation , both curves were set to 1 at @xmath55 .",
    "the faster increase of @xmath53 in the rfm model indicates a weakening of the localization due to the random magnetic fields .",
    "the increase of the localization length is , however , much larger than the factor of 2 expected from rmt @xcite for the breaking of the time reversal symmetry .    in conclusion ,",
    "the localization properties of a two - dimensional electronic model containing random magnetic fields and additional disorder potentials have been investigated numerically .",
    "taking the same parameters as in ref.@xcite for the strength of the random flux , @xmath14 , and the disorder potential @xmath56 , but system sizes up to @xmath50 , our data definitely show complete localization of the electronic states . even for smaller disorder",
    "no sign of a delocalized phase could be detected .",
    "this work was supported in part by the isi foundation ( esprit 8050 small structures ) .",
