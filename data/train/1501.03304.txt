    "analysis of data from nasa s _ kepler _ spacecraft @xcite indicates that planets with radii similar to that of the earth are common @xcite .",
    "recently it was announced that one of the _ kepler _ targets ( kepler-78 ) showed a @xmath7 decline in brightness that was associated with a planet with a radius of only @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "follow - up observations , using harps - n @xcite and the high resolution echelle spectrometer ( hires ) @xcite , confirmed that this is indeed a planet with a mass of about @xmath9 and a density of about @xmath1 g @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "of course it is fascinating that we are now detecting planets with sizes and densities similar to that of the earth , but what makes this planet particularly interesting is that it has an orbital period of only 8.5 hours , meaning that it is orbiting at a distance of only @xmath4 au from its parent star .",
    "quite how such a planet can end up in such an orbit is very uncertain .",
    "it almost certainly could not have formed where it now resides , as the temperature in the disc in that region would have been too high even for dust grains to condense @xcite .",
    "it could potentially have migrated inwards through disc migration . however",
    ", such low - mass planets would migrate in the gapless , type i regime @xcite which is typically thought to be so fast @xcite that it would seem unlikely that such objects could be left stranded so close to their parent stars . population synthesis models @xcite typically assume a reduced type i migration rate .",
    "alternatively , such close - in planets could be scattered onto eccentric orbits @xcite that are then circularised through tidal interactions with the parent star @xcite .",
    "it has indeed been suggested that if such a process were to operate , we should be seeing some very short period hot super - earths @xcite , so this could be an explanation for the origin of kepler-78b .",
    "however , even this study suggested that typical orbital periods would be greater than the 8.5 hour orbital period of kepler-78b .",
    "another mechanism for forming close - in planets , related to dynamical interactions in multi - planet systems , is for the planet to undergo kozai - lidov cycles driven by a stellar companion on a highly inclined orbit @xcite .",
    "if the eccentricity is sufficiently large , so that the periastron becomes very small , the planet s orbit may be circularised through tidal interactions with its host star @xcite .",
    "what we want to investigate in this paper is whether or not this process could indeed explain the origin of kepler-78b . given that binarity amongst solar - like stars is quite high @xcite it seems likely that this could play a role in producing close - in , earth - sized planets .",
    "in this paper we present results from a series of monte carlo simulations in which we consider how a planet with a mass and density the same as that of kepler-78b , but initially orbiting between 0.5 and 2 au , is influenced by perturbations from a binary stellar companion .",
    "we also include the influence of tides , which would allow the orbit to circularise if the eccentricity becomes sufficiently large , and the influence of general relativistic and apsidal precession .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section 2 we present equations of motion , in section 3 we describe the basic setup of the problem , in section 4 we discuss the results , and in section 5 we discuss the results and draw some conclusions .",
    "the goal is to evolve an inner binary ( planet and star ) under the influence of tidal interactions , perturbing accelerations from stellar and planetary distortions due to tides and rotation , perturbing accelerations from a third body , and general relativistic apsidal precession . to quadrupole order",
    ", these equations were first presented by @xcite and can also be found in @xcite and @xcite .    rather than using the equations in @xcite",
    ", we ve implemented those from @xcite and @xcite which are regular at @xmath11 .",
    "we want to evolve an inner system ( planet + host star ) where the bodies have masses @xmath12 and @xmath13 , radii @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and in which the orbit has an eccentricity @xmath16 , semi - major axis @xmath17 , and orbital angular frequency @xmath18 .",
    "the vector quantities that we want to evolve are , therefore , the spin of the parent star @xmath19 , the spin of the planet @xmath20 , the eccentricity of the inner orbit @xmath21 , and angular momentum vector of the inner orbit @xmath22 .",

    "we also impose stability critera @xcite and inisist that @xmath129 and that @xmath130 equation ( [ eq : stab1 ] ) ensures that we are in the regime where the quadrupole and octupole terms dominate , while equation ( [ eq : stab2 ] ) , in which @xmath128 is the mutual inclination of the two orbits , ensures that the triple system is long - term stable @xcite .",

    "[ fig : a_final_log_tmax8d8 ] it seems clear that it is possible for a planet to be perturbed into an orbit inside @xmath136 au within 800 myr .",

    "the planet reaches the roche limit in 480 myr , while for @xmath115 it takes 48 myr .",
    "therefore , it would seem that for reasonable estimates of the star s tidal quality factor , a planet such as kepler-78b will only be detectable inside @xmath136 au for a few hundred myrs at most .",
    "our initial results would therefore seem to suggest that it is possible for an outer companion to perturb a planet like kepler-78b into a very close orbit ( @xmath142 au ) within the age of the system ( @xmath143 myr ) .",
    "however , the numbers are small , with at most @xmath137 out of @xmath144 surviving inside @xmath136 au at @xmath114 myr .      the previous simulations only considered the likelihood of a system with an age similar to that of kepler-78 , having a planetary companion with orbital properties similar to the of kepler-78b .",

    "candidates as small as kepler-78b , however , are typically found around quieter - and therefore older - stars .",

    "if we assume that @xmath149% of those stars have stellar companions @xcite , and that all of those stars could host terrestrial planets @xcite , then we might expect as many as @xmath150 of the @xmath151 _ kepler _ targets , with ages below @xmath135 gyr , to host such a ultra - close - in planet .",
    "of course , our other simulations suggest that the number surviving could be as low as @xmath135 ( depending on the tidal properties of the star and planet ) , but given that the chance of such a system transiting is actually quite high ( @xmath152 ) , observing such a system is still quite likely .",
    "similarly , if we consider only those systems with ages below @xmath153 gyr , figure [ fig : apl_time ] suggests that maybe as many as @xmath138 out of @xmath144 could survive inside @xmath136 au .",
    "repeating the calculation above suggests that maybe @xmath154 stars with ages similar to that of kepler-78 could host such a close - in planet .",
    "again , given the high transit probability for such a close - in system , detecting a planet such as kepler-78b becomes possible .",
    "our results therefore suggest that it is possible for this process to have produced a planet like kepler-78b .",
    "of course , if kepler-78 is closer in age to @xmath108 myr , than to @xmath109 myr , figure [ fig : apl_time ] suggests that it would become less likely .",
    "the results above suggest that it is possible for an outer perturber to drive a kepler-78b - like planet into a close - in orbit within the age of kepler-78 .",
    "to see how the properties of the outer body influences the inner planet , we show - in figure [ fig : mass_a ] - how the final semimajor axis of the planet depends on the mass of the outer body .",
    "again , we only shows results from the simulation with @xmath133 and @xmath116 .",
    "figure [ fig : mass_a ] suggests that there is nt a particularly strong mass dependence , consistent with our simulations essentially being in the test particle regime @xcite .",
    "however , kepler-78 , which has an apparent magnitude of @xmath155 , is not known to host a stellar companion . since _ kepler _ is sensitive down to an apparent magnitude of @xmath156 , that would suggest that if there is an undetected companion it would need to have a mass less that about @xmath134 m@xmath157 .",
    "figure [ fig : aout_eout ] shows how the final semimajor axis of the planet , @xmath17 , depends on the orbital properties of the outer body .",
    "the top panel shows that it is more likely that the planet will end up close to the parent star , if the outer body is in a relatively close orbit ( @xmath158 au ) .",
    "_ kepler s _ has a 4 \" pixel size and so figure [ fig : mass_a ] does suggest that a sufficiently faint , non - variable companion - that could have pertubed a planet into a kepler-78b - like orbit - could indeed have avoided detection . the bottom panel of figure [ fig : aout_eout ] shows how the final semimajor axis of the planet depends on the on the eccentricity ( @xmath38 ) of the outer body .",
    "it indicates that close - in orbits are a little more likely when the companion has a high eccentricity ( @xmath159 ) but are still possible for those with smaller eccentricities .",
    "figures [ fig : a_final_log_tmax8d8 ] and [ fig : a_final_log_tmax2d9 ] show a pile - up of planets inside @xmath161 au , peaking at @xmath162 au . in our simulations , between @xmath163 and @xmath164 ( between @xmath165% and @xmath3% of the full sample of 10000 ) had final semimajor axes inside @xmath161 au ( and had not reached their roche limit ) .",
    "if we assume that @xmath149% of the _ kepler _ sample could have a binary companion ( either primordial or through an exchange interaction ) - and that most sun - like stars have terrestrial - mass , planetary companions @xcite - then our results suggest that as much as @xmath166 % of the _ kepler _ sample might have planets that have been perturbed into close - in orbits , with a distribution that peaks at about @xmath167 au .",
    "this is intriguingly similar to the suggestion in @xcite that about 1 in 200 _ kepler _ stars hosts a planet with a period of @xmath153 day or less .",
    "an interesting aspect of the kozai - lidov process is that it can perturb a planet into an orbit that is inclined with respect to its initial plane and , hence , inclined with respect to the spin of the host star @xcite .",
    "we now have a number of close - in , ` hot ' jupiters that are on orbits inclined with respect to the spin of the host star @xcite and these are thought to be a consequence of kozai - lidov cycles .",
    "figure [ fig : aplan_inc_inner ] shows the final angle ( obliquity ) between the angular momentum vector of the inner planet s orbit and the spin of the central star , and shows that a wide range of obliquities are possible .",
    "all the systems initially have obliquities of zero ( the angular momentum of the inner orbit is aligned with the spins of the parent star and planet ) and figure [ fig : aplan_inc_inner ] shows that those that are perturbed into an inner orbit can then be tidally circularised with a large range of obliquities , consistent with other similar studies @xcite . using the rossiter - mclaughlin method to determine such a mis - alignment ( e.g. @xcite ) is probably not possible for such a low - mass planet , but it may be possible to do so using spot - crossing @xcite or astro - seismology @xcite .",
    "we have considered , here , if systems like kepler-78b ( an earth - like exoplanet with a very close - in orbit ) could be due to a perturbation from an outer companion on an , initially , inclined orbit . to do this",
    ", we consider a system in which the star and planet have the same masses and radii as in the kepler-78 system @xcite , but in which the planet initially has an almost circular orbit with a semi - major axis between @xmath134 and @xmath135 au . the system is also assumed to have an outer companion with a semimajor axis between @xmath149 and @xmath168 au , with an orbital eccentricity that can be as high as @xmath169 ( but constrained by stability criteria ) and that may be inclined with respect to the plane of the inner orbit .",
    "we ran a suite of monte carlo simulations in which we randomly select the inner and outer systems semi - major axes , the eccentricity of the outer system , the mass of the outer companion and the mutual inclination of the two orbits .",
    "we ran two sets of simulations , one where each system was evolved for @xmath114 myr , similar to the expected age of the kepler-78 system , and the other where the age of the system was randomly selected to be between @xmath145 myr and @xmath135 gyr . our basic results are that :    * it is possible for a planet to be perturbed into an orbit similar to that of kepler-78b around a star with an age ( @xmath170 myr ) similar to that of kepler-78 . out of a sample of 10000 , between @xmath138 and @xmath137",
    "survive inside @xmath136 au . *",
    "if we consider a broader age range , the likely binarity of the _ kepler _ sample , and the size of the _ kepler _ sample , our results suggest that as many as @xmath150 of the _ kepler _ targets with ages less than @xmath135 gyr could host a kepler-78b - like planet . additionally , we find that a system with an age similar to that of kepler-78 could indeed have been found to host a kepler-78b - like planet .",
    "* a planet such as kepler-78b will , quite quickly , reach its roche limit and be tidally destroyed .",
    "our results suggest that such a planet would only survive inside @xmath136 au for a few hundred myrs , at most . in the simulations here , typically in excess of @xmath171 , but no more than @xmath172 , ( out of @xmath144 ) reached their roche limit and were assumed to be destroyed .",
    "this appears consistent with other work that has also suggested that this process could lead to the tidal destruction of perturbed planets @xcite . *",
    "given _ kepler s _ 4 \" pixel size and magnitude limit , it is possible that a faint , non - variable companion that could drive kozai - lidov cycles may have gone undetected .",
    "that the companion appears to need to be inside @xmath171 au , means that it may be possible to detect the resulting radial velocity drift .",
    "* if a planet such as kepler-78b were perturbed into its current orbit through kozai - lidov cycles , we might expect the star s rotation axis to be misaligned with respect to the planet s orbit .",
    "measuring the star s obliquity is quite difficult , but could be possible using spot - crossing @xcite or using astro - seismology @xcite . * even though it appears possible that a system such as kepler-78b could form in this way , it appears to be more likely for system older than @xmath153 gyr , than for systems younger than @xmath153 gyr .",
    "our basic results , therefore , suggest that such a process could operate , but there are some caveats .",
    "although it is possible for a system with an age similar to that of kepler-78 to host a planet like kepler-78b , the numbers are small ( we may expect the _ kepler _ sample to host only a few such planets ) . additionally it seems that it would have been more likely to have found such a planet in a slightly older system .",
    "these results , therefore , suggest that kozai - lidov cycles could have played a role in the evolution of kepler-78b , but do nt rule out that there could be an alternative explanation , such as planet - planet scattering @xcite.this , however , may suffer from the similar issues , since the dominant constraint - given the relatively low age of kepler-78 - is the tidal evolution timescale .",
    "this constraint would probably also apply to the tidal downsizing hypothesis @xcite , in which a massive gas - giant planet formed in the outer parts of the system , migrates rapidly inwards and loses masses via tidal stripping . that , of course , leaves the possibility that disc migration @xcite moved this planet into a very close orbit which has since evolved , through tidal interactions with the host star , into the orbit it inhabits today .",
    "again , this would also involve tidal evolution once the disc has dispersed and so may also have a similar timescale issue , unless disc migration can place the planet sufficiently close to the parent star so that it can then tidally evolve to where it is today .",
    "recent work by @xcite suggest that about 1 out of every 200 stars hosts an ultra short period ( usp ) planet ( period of 1 day or less ) . although we ve focussed on kepler-78b here and found that few of our simulated systems have final periods as short as kepler-78b ( 8.5 hours ) , many more have periods of @xmath153 day or less .",
    "the exact number depends on the chosen parameters , but it varies from @xmath173 to just over @xmath172 ( from a total sample of 10000 ) .",
    "given that not all stars are binaries , this is intriguingly similar to the result in @xcite .",
    "similarly , our results suggest that such a process should lead to a pile - up of planets with a peak at about @xmath167 au , again consistent with @xcite who find that the occurence rate rises with period from 0.2 to 1 day .",
    "it may , however , be difficult to distinguish a pile - up due to kozai - lidov cycles from what is expected from scattering in multi - planet systems @xcite .",
    "@xcite do , however , suggest that almost all usps have companion planets with period @xmath174 days , which may provide a constraint on the formation process for these usps .",
    "we should also acknowledge the possibility that our assumptions do not properly represent the possible initial conditions such a system could have .",
    "the initial distribution of the planet in semimajor axis space may be different to what we ve assumed and the orbital properties of the outer perturber may also be different .",
    "similarly , the tidal properties of the parent star and planet may differ from what we ve assumed .",
    "however , we should at least acknowledge that even though our results suggest that kozai - lidov cycles will rarely produce a planet with properties similar to that of kepler-78b , kepler-78b is itself rare . in that sense our results",
    "could be seen as somewhat consistent with our knowledge of such planets , but that - alone - does nt allow us to determine if it is likely that such a process did indeed play a role in the evolution of kepler-78b .",
