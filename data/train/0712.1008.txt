    "combinatorial optimization problems ( cops ) such as the traveling salesman problem are important in almost every branch of science , from computer science to statistical physics and computational biology  @xcite .",
    "a cop consists of a family of _ instances _ of the problem ; each instance is an optimization problem , to minimize ( or maximize ) some objective function over a finite set @xmath3 of @xmath4 elements , called the space of _",
    "states_. this space may have additional structure ( e.g. , it may be a graph ) , allowing the definition of a notion of locality ; and the set of objective functions may have special properties depending on the particular cop .",
    "in general multiple local minima may be present .",
    "finding a solution by exhaustive search is hard in general , due to the large size of the search space .",
    "therefore , more efficient optimization approaches are desirable .",
    "efficiency is typically quantified in terms of how the resources needed to find the optimum scale with the _ instance size _ , which is typically polynomial in @xmath5 .",
    "simulated annealing ( sa ) is a possible generic strategy for solving a cop  @xcite .",
    "the idea of sa is to imitate the process undergone by a metal that is heated to a high temperature and then cooled slowly enough for thermal excitations to prevent it from getting stuck in local minima , so that it ends up in one of its lowest - energy states . in sa ,",
    "the objective function plays the role of energy , so the lowest energy state is the optimum .",
    "this process can be simulated using different techniques ; we focus on discrete markov chain monte - carlo ( mcmc ) .",
    "these methods are often used to numerically obtain properties of , for example , classical physical lattice systems in equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "the general idea of mcmc is to stochastically generate a sequence of states via a process that converges to a target probability distribution .",
    "this is the boltzmann distribution at the low final temperature in the case of sa .",
    "the efficiency of the method relies on the fact that , in general , only a small proportion of states contribute significantly to the determination of properties in equilibrium .",
    "therefore , if a good state - generating rule is chosen , the mcmc algorithm can explore the most relevant states only , outperforming exhaustive search .",
    "one way to estimate the implementation complexity of sa using mcmc is to count the number of times that the state - generating rule must be executed ( i.e. , the number of generated states ) in order that the desired distribution is reached within an acceptable error .",
    "this complexity , denoted by @xmath6 , is of order @xmath7 ( see sec .",
    "[ siman ] ) . here",
    ", @xmath1 is the minimum spectral gap of the stochastic matrices used to generate states for the cop via mcmc  @xcite , while @xmath8 is the error probability , that is , the probability that the final state sampled via this process is not a solution ( not in the set @xmath9 of optimal states ) .",
    "ideally , @xmath6 is insignificant compared to the size of the state space .",
    "this is the situation , for example , when computing physical properties of the ising spin model using the metropolis rule  @xcite . in this example @xmath6",
    "is known to be of order @xmath10 for a system of @xmath11 spins , while the state space dimension is @xmath12 .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath6 can increase rapidly with @xmath11 if the interaction strengths are made random  @xcite , making the problem intractable in general . in this case , this is due to the gap @xmath1 becoming exponentially small in @xmath11 ( instance size ) .",
    "therefore , finding new methods with better scaling in @xmath1 , yielding speedups over sa , is of great importance .",
    "quantum mechanics provides new resources with which to attack these optimization problems  @xcite .",
    "quantum computers ( qcs ) can theoretically solve some problems , including integer number factorization and search problems , more efficiently than today s conventional computers  @xcite . still , whether a qc can solve all cops more efficiently than its classical counterpart is an open question . in this paper",
    "we show that qcs can also be used to speed up the simulation of classical annealing processes .",
    "that is , we present a new quantum algorithm that can be seen as the quantum analogue of sa using mcmc , but for which the number of times that the state - generating rule is called ( @xmath13 ) is greatly reduced to @xmath14 , to achieve error bounded by @xmath8 , in a single run .",
    "this speed - up is most significant for hard instances where @xmath15 .",
    "our quantum simulated annealing algorithm ( qsa ) is constructed using ideas and techniques from quantum walks  @xcite and quantum phase estimation  @xcite .",
    "the qsa also exploits the so - called quantum zeno effect  @xcite , in which after @xmath16 measurements of a quantum system at short time - intervals @xmath17 the state is collapsed onto the ground state with total probability @xmath18 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in sec .  [ siman ] , we describe the implementation of sa using discrete - time mcmc , and in appendix  [ appendixa ] we derive a rate at which the temperature of a classical system can be lowered to assure convergence to the set of ground states . to do this we adapt the results obtained for the continuous - time case in ref .",

    "we consider the simulation of a classical annealing process via mcmc , and give annealing rates such that the final sampled state is almost certain to be in the set @xmath9 of optimal solutions to a cop . to do this",

    ".    a ground state can be reached by annealing slowly enough , starting with @xmath3 at sufficiently high temperature .",
