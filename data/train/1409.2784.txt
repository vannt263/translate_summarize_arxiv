    "massive stars ( @xmath12 m@xmath2 ; see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) usually end their lives exploding as core - collapse supernovae ( cc - sne ) leaving behind a compact remnant ( neutron star or black hole depending on the mass of the star that exploded ) .",
    "the stellar configuration prior to explosion is what leads to the different observational sub types of cc - sne .",
    "specifically , type iib sne are thought to arise from the explosion of stars that had retained a small part ( a few tenths of m@xmath2 ) of their hydrogen layer , and along with type ib and ic sne belong to the so - called stripped - envelope sne category ( se - sne ) @xcite .",
    "the reason why type iib sn progenitors have lost most of their hydrogen envelope prior to exploding is unclear , although two scenarios are contemplated : 1 ) transfer of most of the stellar envelope of the progenitor to a companion star ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; 2 ) mass loss due to stellar winds @xcite .",
    "type iib sne are relatively infrequent events .",
    "their rate among a volume limited sample of 81 type ii sne was estimated by @xcite to be @xmath13 .",
    "the asiago sn catalogue lists about 86 type iib sne but only a few of them have been extensively monitored .",
    "their spectra show a transition from being dominated by hydrogen at early phases , to predominance of hei features at later times @xcite .",
    "concerning their light curves ( lcs ) , some type iib sne present clear double - peaked lcs in all optical bands , as in the case of sn  1993j ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and sn  2011fu @xcite .",
    "other iib sne show the first peak only in some of their optical and uv bands , e.g. sne 2008ax @xcite and 2011dh @xcite .",
    "this is probably due to the short duration of the first peak in these sne that can be missed by observations .",
    "the first peak of the lcs of iib sne is attributed to shock wave heating of the hydrogen envelope , while the longer lasting secondary peak is powered by the decay of @xmath0ni @xcite .",
    "other sne , that are not of type iib , have also presented an initial peak in their optical lcs before climbing to a secondary maximum .",
    "this is the case for example of type ii - peculiar 1987a ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or type ib / ic sn 2005bf @xcite . for sn 1987a , the initial peak has also been explained in terms of an adiabatic cooling of its stellar envelope after the shock breakout that follows core - collapse of massive stars .",
    "however , for sn 2005bf @xcite gave an alternative explanation for the early peak calling for a double - peaked @xmath0ni distribution , this is , some @xmath0ni is mixed in the outer layers of the ejecta",
    ".    confirmed progenitor identifications for type iib sne have been achieved for sn  1993j @xcite and for sn  2011dh @xcite . in both cases",
    "the progenitor stars were revealed to be yellow supergiants . for sn  2008ax , the progenitor",
    "was also found in archival images @xcite , but there were multiple configurations that matched its observed colours .",
    "two scenarios were proposed , one consisting of a single progenitor and another based on a binary system , but in both cases the explosion involved a supergiant . with respect to the binary scenario , a blue companion to sn",
    "1993j was identified about ten years after its explosion @xcite , and possibly the companion of sn  2001ig was also found by @xcite .",
    "recently , the indirect detection of the wolf rayet - like progenitor of type iib sn 2013cu has been possible from spectral observations of its stellar wind right after explosion @xcite .",
    "+ the most recent probable identification of a type iib sn progenitor from hubble space telescope ( hst ) archival images has been that of the yellow supergiant precursor of the type iib sn  2013df @xcite .",
    "+ sn  2013df , having coordinates @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( j2000 ) , was discovered in the galaxy ngc  4414 by f. ciabattari and e. mazzoni of the italian supernovae project ( issp ) , on 2013 june 7.87 ut @xcite .",
    "sn  2013df is the second sn discovered in ngc  4414 , the first being the type ia sn 1974 g . a spectrum of sn  2013df taken soon after discovery ( 2013 june 10.8 ut ) showed characteristics of a type ii supernova resembling early spectra of the type iib sn  1993j @xcite .",
    "soon after discovery of the sn , x - ray detection coming from a source at the sn position ( 2.1 arcsec offset ) was reported by @xcite . the absorption corrected average luminosity ( @xmath16kev ) of their observations , which spanned from 2013 june 13 to 2013 june 19 , was @xmath17erg  s@xmath18 .",
    "this luminosity most likely has its origin in the sn , as it falls in the range of other x - ray detected sne , and it is less probable to arise from diffuse emission of ngc  4414 .",
    "some early time optical data of sn  2013df were presented in @xcite and confirmed its type iib nature . in this manuscript",
    "we present the analysis of additional optical photometric and spectroscopic data for sn  2013df , as well as ultraviolet and late time data .",
    "the monitoring of sn  2013df from early to late time after explosion , has offered us a unique opportunity to investigate the evolution of the observed properties of a relatively nearby type iib sn , which presents double - peaked lcs in all optical bands , and for which the plausible progenitor has been identified . in section 2 , we summarize the reduction and calibration process of our observational data of sn  2013df . in section 3",
    "we present our photometric results .",
    "the spectroscopic analysis is described in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we derive some constraints on the progenitor s characteristics , and in section 6 we summarize our results . in appendix",
    "[ appendix ] , we provide details of the instrumental set - ups used in the acquisition of our data of sn  2013df .",
    "throughout this work , we will adopt as the distance modulus to ngc  4414 @xmath19 mag .",
    "this estimation was obtained as the weighted mean value of distance moduli provided by the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "the redshift for sn  2013df is assumed to be that of its host galaxy as given by ned ( @xmath20 @xmath21 ) .",
    "the reddening in the line of sight of the sn due to the milky way @xcite is @xmath22  mag .",
    "thus , adopting @xmath23  mag as the sn reddening in the host - galaxy @xcite , we assume in the rest of this manuscript @xmath24  mag as the total reddening toward sn  2013df .",
    "+   + @xcite performed a study of the distribution of the subtypes of 78 cc - sne in dwarf compared to giant galaxies . in their sample",
    "there were four type iib sne whose hosts were luminous galaxies . keeping in mind the very small statistics and the uncertainties in the early classification of type iib sne , their result does not confirm the excess of type iib sne in dwarf hosts claimed by @xcite and , on the contrary , it is in agreement with @xcite , who found no statistical differences between the metallicity distributions of type ib and ic or between type ib and iib sne . with our adopted distance , the reddening towards ngc  4414 due to the milky way , and the apparent _ v _ magnitude given by simbad",
    "we obtain for ngc  4414 @xmath25 .",
    "so , ngc  4414 is another example of a luminous ( giant ) host for a type iib sn .",
    "we started an optical observational follow - up campaign of sn  2013df on 2013 june 11.93 ut ( a few days after its discovery ) , the campaign was suspended at the end of july 2013 when the supernova went behind the sun and resumed again to acquire some late time data from november 20th , 2013 to february 11th , 2014 .",
    "our data were obtained at different sites ( see appendix[appendix ] ) .",
    "the reduction and calibration processes of the data are described below :    1 .",
    "photometry + non - amateur optical photometric data were reduced ( overscan , bias and flat field corrected ) within the iraf environment for all instruments except for data obtained at lt , for which reductions are usually performed with specific pipelines . the measurement of instrumental magnitudes of the sn were performed via point spread function ( psf ) fitting by means of snoopy .",
    "a total of 5 local stars , identified in figure [ fig:13dfsequence ] , were chosen to derive the instrumental psf and to calibrate the optical _ ubvri _ sn lcs .",
    "+ once instrumental magnitudes were measured , calibration of the local stellar field to a standard photometric system was performed by means of the zero points and colour terms derived thanks to the observation of standard landolt fields @xcite on photometric nights .",
    "the apparent magnitudes of the stellar sequence and their associated errors are reported in table  [ sequence_mags ] both in the johnson cousins - jc - system and in the sloan system , and are the mean values of the magnitudes obtained over photometric nights while the errors are the r.m.s .",
    "uncertainties over these nights .",
    "the sn magnitudes were derived relative to the mean magnitudes of our stellar sequence .",
    "+ the unfiltered magnitudes obtained from the images provided by f. ciabattari , k. itagaki and s. howerton were rescaled to jc _ v _ band or _",
    "r _ band , depending on the wavelength peak efficiency of the detectors .",
    "the data provided by n. schramm were taken with a colour camera , which has a colour filter array ( or bayer - mask ) that arranges the red , green , and blue response on each pixel of the ccd .",
    "we subdivided in blue , green , and red images each of the frames .",
    "one of the main problems when doing this is that gaps result between the pixels of the images of the same colour . after re - binning the images , we derived sn magnitudes from these data and we rescaled to _ b _ , _ v _ , and _",
    "r _ band magnitudes those derived from the blue , green and red images respectively .",
    "+ we note that we have not performed s - corrections @xcite to our photometric data of sn  2013df . + + [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ constraints ]    our result for sn  2013df s @xmath26 is of the order of that obtained for sn  1993j in @xcite , and an order of magnitude above the ones derived for sn  2011dh .",
    "as noted in @xcite , @xmath27 is not the total mass of the envelope surrounding the core , but just the fraction distributed around @xmath28 .",
    "the similarity between @xmath27 for sne 2013df and 1993j suggests that the mass of the hydrogen shell in sn  2013df s progenitor prior to explosion is similar to that of sn  1993j , i.e. @xmath29 @xmath30 @xcite , and slightly above the value for sn  2011dh @xmath31 @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "concerning the extended radius of sn  2013df , we have derived a range of @xmath5 @xmath32 .",
    "we stress that this range is based on the _ r _ luminosity instead of bolometric luminosity , which makes it a lower limit , as @xmath33 . taking into account the spectral and photometric similarity between sne 2013df and 1993j , sn  2013df s bolometric luminosity at first",
    "peak could be about a factor of 2 times brighter than the _",
    "r _ band specific luminosity .",
    "this could increase the estimate for sn2013df s @xmath34 by a factor of 1.5 .",
    "however , we must also take into account that for sn  1993j , @xmath34 derived by @xcite is a factor 1.9 below that obtained from the modelling of the light curve , and a similar underestimate could also take place for sn  2013df . multiplying our lower limit range on the extended radius of sn  2013df s progenitor by these two factors , brings it closer to the value derived by @xcite from the pre - sn hst archival images , i.e. @xmath35@xmath32 .",
    "finally we note that the range we have obtained for the upper limit to sn  2013df s core radius is much larger than the ones estimated for both sne 1993j and 2011dh .",
    "given the similar ejecta masses ( table  [ abs - vmag ] ) this could suggest that the progenitor core of sn  2013df was not as compact as for sne 1993j and 2011dh .",
    "we have presented the analysis of our optical observations for the type iib sn  2013df ( complemented by uv data taken by _ swift _ ) spanning from a few days up to 250 days after explosion .",
    "we have found sn  2013df to share common characteristics with previous type iib sne .",
    "photometrically , similar to sne 1993j and 2011fu , sn  2013df s lcs present two peaks in all bands .",
    "absolute magnitude lc evolves from a first maximum of @xmath36 to a minimum value of @xmath37 , and then increases its brightness until reaching a secondary maximum of @xmath38 approximately twelve days after the minimum . in common with sne 1993j , 2008ax and 2011dh ,",
    "the late decline rates are faster than the radioactive decay of @xmath0co .",
    "+ from the modelling of the bolometric light curve ( not including the first peak ) , we have obtained an explosion energy of @xmath39erg , a @xmath0ni mass in the range @xmath40 m@xmath2 and a total ejected mass of @xmath41 m@xmath2 .",
    "these results are overall consistent with other modelled iib sne .",
    "+ the earliest spectrum of our sequence shows a flat - bottomed h@xmath42 absorption indicative of the presence of an extended h shell in the ejecta , which is the outer layer of the progenitor s envelope .",
    "the presence of conspicuous hydrogen in our spectra up to later phases than in sn  2008ax , is indicative of possibly a slightly larger mass of the h shell in sn  2013df .",
    "furthermore , the resemblance of sn  2013df s spectra with those of sn  1993j indicate that the h shell of both sne could be similar ( @xmath29 @xmath30 ) and thus possibly above the value estimated for sn  2011dh ( @xmath31 @xmath30 ) .",
    "our nebular spectra are characterised by the presence of two components around 6500 - 6600   and 6700 - 6800   that are possibly h@xmath42 in emission caused by asymmetrical interaction of the ejecta with circumstellar material .",
    "further spectral modelling should be done in order to confirm this speculative claim .",
    "from the [ oi ] @xmath8@xmath8@xmath9 , @xmath10 luminosities we have derived a rough estimate to the initial mass of sn  2013df s progenitor @xmath43 . from the analysis of the nebular profiles of [ oi ] and [ caii ] ,",
    "we conclude that the substructure they exhibit is indicative of the presence of different clumps where these species are being excited in the ejecta .",
    "+ finally , we have followed the procedure described in @xcite to add some additional constrains on some progenitor characteristics of sn  2013df assuming that it was a non - standard progenitor formed by a compact core and an extended low - mass envelope .",
    "we have estimated a mass range for the extended material similar to sn  1993j , which in accordance to our spectra , leads us to believe both sne 1993j and 2013df had similar hydrogen shells prior to explosion .",
    "in addition , we estimated a lower limit to the radius for sn  2013df s progenitor of @xmath5 @xmath44 . at last",
    ", we have obtained an upper limit to the core radius of sn  2013df s progenitor @xmath45 cm which are well above those derived for sne 1993j and 2011dh .",
    "+ sn  2013df is the third type iib sn presenting double - peaked light curves in all its optical bands .",
    "in addition , its progenitor has been identified in archival images .",
    "further modelling of the sn data and future observations of the sn field may help extract more information on the possible yellow supergiant that exploded as sn  2013df and the conditions that produced its observed properties .",
