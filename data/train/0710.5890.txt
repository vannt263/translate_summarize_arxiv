    "an exotic atom is formed when a negatively charged particle stops in a target and is captured by a target atom into an outer atomic orbit .",
    "it will then emit auger electrons and characteristic x - rays whilst cascading down its own sequence of atomic levels until , at some state of low principal quantum number @xmath8 , the particle is absorbed due to its interaction with the nucleus .",
    "the lifetimes of the particles considered here , namely @xmath0 and @xmath1 , are much longer than typical slowing down times and atomic time scales .",
    "therefore , following the stopping of the hadron in matter , well defined states of an exotic atom are established and the effects of the hadron - nucleus strong interaction can be studied .",
    "the overlap of the atomic orbitals with the nucleus covers a wide range of nuclear densities thus creating a unique source of information on the density dependence of the hadronic interaction .    in the study of strong interaction effects in exotic atoms ,",
    "the observables of interest are the shifts ( @xmath9 ) and widths ( @xmath10 ) of the atomic levels caused by the strong interaction with the nucleus .",
    "these levels are shifted and broadened relative to the electromagnetic case but the shifts and widths can usually only be measured directly for one , or possibly two levels in any particular hadronic atom .",
    "the broadening due to the nuclear absorption usually terminates the atomic cascade at low @xmath8 thus limiting the experimentally observed x - ray spectrum . in some cases the width of the next higher @xmath11 ` upper ' level can be obtained indirectly from measurements of the relative yields of x - rays when they depart from their purely electromagnetic values . as the atomic number and size of the nucleus increase",
    ", so the absorption occurs from higher @xmath8-values as shown for @xmath0 atoms and for @xmath1 atoms in the corresponding sections .",
    "shifts and widths caused by the interaction with the nucleus may be calculated by adding an optical potential to the coulomb interaction .",
    "the study of the strong interaction in exotic atoms thus becomes the study of this additional potential , as reviewed in great detail by batty , friedman and gal @xcite and very recently by friedman and gal @xcite . on the experimental side , studies of strong interaction effects in exotic atoms",
    "have been transformed over the years with the introduction of increasingly more advanced x - ray detectors and with increasing the efficiency of stopping the hadrons , such as with a cyclotron trap @xcite .",
    "the present lectures focus particularly on the physics of the strong interaction which can be deduced by studying strange atoms , a term which is used for exotic atoms formed initially by stopping @xmath0 mesons in matter .",
    "the importance of the strange atoms subject stems from the progress made in recent years in quantifying medium modification effects on the hadron - nucleus interaction which has enabled one to achieve improved fits to existing data within the framework of commonly accepted models @xcite .",
    "these modified interactions obey a low density limit which has not always been enforced in earlier analyses , since it is not always relevant to the higher density regime explored , where new features of the hadron nucleus interaction may become significant to other fields such as astrophysics .    in the next section we will outline the methodology of exotic - atom studies , including common tools such as wave equations and optical potentials . of prime importance",
    "is the dependence of the optical potential on the model of nuclear density used , with emphasis placed on the overlap region between the atomic state studied and the nucleus .",
    "radial sensitivity will be defined , to serve as a guide .",
    "finally the extreme non perturbative nature of exotic atoms will be discussed .",
    "readers who are not concerned about these tools of analyzing exotic atoms may skip the next section and go immediately to the sections dealing with @xmath0 atoms and nuclei and with @xmath7 hyperons .",
    "the interaction of hadrons at threshold with the nucleus is customarily described by a klein - gordon ( kg ) equation which for exotic - atom applications is of the following form :    @xmath12 \\psi = 0~~ ~~(\\hbar = c = 1)\\ ] ]    where @xmath13 is the hadron - nucleus reduced mass , @xmath14 is the complex binding energy and @xmath15 is the finite - size coulomb interaction of the hadron with the nucleus , including vacuum - polarization terms , added according to the minimal substitution principle @xmath16 .",
    "a term @xmath17 and a term @xmath18 were neglected in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kg ] ) with respect to @xmath19 ; the term @xmath18 has to be reinstated in studies of deeply - bound states .",
    "the optical potential @xmath20 is of the @xmath21 generic class which for underlying @xmath22-wave hadron - nucleon interactions assumes the form :    @xmath23 + \\tau_z b_1[\\rho_n(r)-\\rho_p(r ) ] \\ } \\;.\\ ] ]    here , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the neutron and proton density distributions normalized to the number of neutrons @xmath26 and number of protons @xmath27 , respectively , @xmath28 is the mass of the nucleon and @xmath29 for the negatively charged hadrons considered in the present lectures . in the impulse approximation , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are minus the hadron - nucleon isoscalar and isovector scattering lengths , respectively , which are complex for the absorptive strong interactions of @xmath0 mesons and @xmath1 hyperons .",
    "generally these ` one - nucleon ' parameters are functions of the density @xmath32 , but often the density dependence may be approximated by fitting effective values for @xmath30 and @xmath31 to low - energy data .",
    "the extension of the threshold kg equation ( [ eq : kg ] ) and the optical potential ( [ eq : vopt ] ) for scattering problems is straightforward @xcite .",
    "the use of the kg equation rather than the dirac equation for fermions , such as @xmath7 hyperons , is numerically justified when fine - structure effects are negligible or are treated in an average way , as for the x - ray transitions considered here . the leading @xmath33 dependence ( @xmath34 ) of the energy for solutions of the dirac equation for a point - charge @xmath35",
    "potential goes as @xmath36 , and on averaging it over the projections of @xmath33 gives rise to @xmath37 which is precisely the leading @xmath38 dependence of the energy for solutions of the kg equation .",
    "the higher - order contributions to the spin - orbit splitting are suppressed by o@xmath39 which is of order 1@xmath40 for the high-@xmath8 x - ray transitions encountered for @xmath7 hyperons .",
    "this is considerably smaller than the experimental errors placed on the measured x - ray transition energies and widths .",
    "the nuclear densities are an essential ingredient of the optical potential .",
    "the density distribution of the protons is usually considered known as it is obtained from the nuclear charge distribution by unfolding the finite size of the charge of the proton .",
    "the neutron distributions are , however , generally not known to sufficient accuracy . for many nuclei",
    "there is no direct experimental information whatsoever on neutron densities and one must then rely on models which sometimes give conflicting results for the root - mean - square ( rms ) radii .",
    "given this unsettled state of affairs , a semi - phenomenological approach was adopted that covers a broad range of possible neutron density distributions .",
    "experience with pionic atoms showed @xcite that the feature of neutron density distributions which is most relevant in determining strong interaction effects in pionic atoms is the radial extent , as represented e.g. by @xmath41 , the neutron density rms radius .",
    "a linear dependence of @xmath42 on @xmath43 has been successfully employed in @xmath44 studies @xcite , namely @xmath45 with @xmath46 close to 1.0  fm and @xmath47 close to zero .",
    "expression ( [ eq : rmf ] ) has been adopted in analyzing strange atoms and , for lack of better global information about neutron densities , the value of @xmath46 was varied over a reasonable range in fitting to the data .",
    "this procedure is based on the expectation that for a large data set over the whole of the periodic table some local variations will cancel out and that an average behavior may be established .",
    "phenomenological studies of in - medium nuclear interactions are based on such averages .    in order to allow for possible differences in the shape of the neutron distribution , a two - parameter fermi ( 2pf )",
    "distribution was used both for the known proton ( unfolded from the charge distribution ) and for the unknown neutron density distributions @xmath48 in the ` skin ' form of ref .",
    "@xcite . in this form ,",
    "the same diffuseness parameter for protons and neutrons , @xmath49 , is assumed and the @xmath50 parameter is determined from the rms radius @xmath41 deduced from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rmf ] ) where @xmath51 is considered to be known .",
    "it was checked that for @xmath0 atoms and for @xmath1 atoms the assumption of ` skin ' form was as good , or better , than assuming other ( notably ` halo ' ) forms .",
    "another sensitivity that may be checked in global fits is to the radial extension of the hadron - nucleon interaction when folded together with the nuclear density .",
    "the resultant ` finite range ' density is defined as @xmath52 assuming a gaussian interaction .",
    "it was found that @xmath0 and @xmath1 atoms do not display sensitivity to finite - range effects .",
    "the radial sensitivity of exotic atom data was addressed before @xcite with the help of a ` notch test ' , introducing a local perturbation into the potential and studying the changes in the fit to the data as function of position of the perturbation .",
    "the results gave at least a semi - quantitative information on what are the radial regions which are being probed by the various types of exotic atoms .",
    "however , the radial extent of the perturbation was somewhat arbitrary and only very recently that approach was extended @xcite into a mathematically well - defined limit .    in order to study",
    "the radial sensitivity of _ global _ fits to exotic atom data , it is necessary to define the radial position parameter globally using as reference , e.g. the known charge distribution for each nuclear species in the data base .",
    "the radial position @xmath53 is then defined as @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the radius and diffuseness parameters , respectively , of a 2pf charge distribution @xcite . in that way",
    "@xmath57 becomes the relevant radial parameter when handling together data for several nuclear species along the periodic table .",
    "the value of @xmath58 is regarded now as a functional of a global optical potential @xmath59 , i.e. @xmath60 $ ] , where the parameter @xmath57 is a _ continuous _ variable .",
    "it leads to @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62}{\\delta v(\\eta ' ) } = \\lim_{\\sigma \\rightarrow 0}\\lim_{\\epsilon _ v \\rightarrow 0 } \\frac{\\chi^2[v(\\eta)+\\epsilon _ v\\delta_{\\sigma}(\\eta-\\eta')]-\\chi^2[v(\\eta ) ] }       { \\epsilon _ v}\\;\\ ] ] is the functional derivative ( fd ) of @xmath63 $ ] .",
    "the notation @xmath64 stands for an approximated @xmath47-function and @xmath65 is a change in the potential . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : dchi2 ] ) it is seen that the fd determines the effect of a local change in the optical potential on @xmath66 .",
    "conversely it can be said that the optical potential sensitivity to the experimental data is determined by the magnitude of the fd .",
    "calculation of the fd may be carried out by multiplying the best fit potential by a factor @xmath67 using a normalized gaussian with a range parameter @xmath68 for the smeared @xmath47-function , @xmath69 for finite values of @xmath9 and @xmath68 the fd can then be approximated by @xmath70}{\\delta v(\\eta ' ) } \\approx \\frac{1}{v(\\eta ' ) } \\frac{\\chi^2[v(\\eta)(1+\\epsilon\\delta_{\\sigma}(\\eta-\\eta ' ) ) ]        -\\chi^2[v(\\eta ) ] }       { \\epsilon}\\;.\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath71 is used for a _ fractional _ change in the potential and the limit @xmath72 is obtained numerically for several values of @xmath73 and then extrapolated to @xmath74 .      the optical potentials used to calculate the shifts and widths of atomic energy levels are confined to a small region of the atom and thus lead to very small energy shifts compared to the corresponding binding energies . however , they greatly modify the wavefunction locally and this modification makes the strong interaction effects non - perturbative . for example",
    ", in kaonic atoms all the measured level shifts are repulsive , yet ` @xmath75 ' fits to the data invariably lead to attractive potentials .",
    "the net repulsive shift is due to the imaginary part of the potential being comparable in magnitude to the real part .",
    "repulsive shifts may also arise from dominantly real attractive optical potentials that are sufficiently strong to bind _ nuclear _ states . a nuclear state generated by the optical potential",
    "gives rise to a node inside the nucleus for the atomic wavefunction by orthogonality .",
    "the strong modification of atomic wavefunctions due to binding nuclear states by @xmath20 may also give rise to irregularities in the parameters of @xmath20 obtained from fits to data .",
    "this effect was first observed by krell @xcite for kaonic atoms .",
    "these irregularities can be explained by large variations in the atomic wavefunctions such that additional nodes may be accommodated within the nucleus .",
    "a more comprehensive discussion of these nonperturbative aspects is found in ref .",
    "the @xmath0-atom data used in global fits  @xcite are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : katoms ] , spanning a range of atomic states from @xmath77 in li to @xmath78 in u , with 65 level - shifts , widths and transition yields data points .",
    "we note that the shifts are ` repulsive ' , largely due to the substantial absorptivity of the @xmath0-nuclear interaction .",
    "it was shown already in the mid 1990s  @xcite that although a reasonably good fit to the data is obtained for a @xmath79 potential , eq .",

    "fitted potentials of this kind are marked dd .",
    "this parameterization offers the advantage of fixing @xmath30 at its ( repulsive ) free - space value in order to respect the low - density limit , while relegating the expected in - medium attraction to the @xmath83 term which goes with a higher power of the density .",

    "are shown the individual contributions to @xmath58 of the shifts for the deep f potential and the shallow chirally - based potential ( of depth about 50 mev ) due to baca et al .",
    "it is self evident that the agreement between calculation and experiment is substantially better for the deep f potential than for the shallow chiral potential .",
    "the question of how well the real part of the @xmath0-nucleus potential is determined was discussed in ref .",
    "estimating the uncertainties of hadron - nucleus potentials as function of position is not a simple task .",
    "for example , in the ` @xmath79 ' approach the shape of the potential is determined by the nuclear density distribution and the uncertainty in the strength parameter , as obtained from @xmath58 fits to the data , implies a fixed _ relative _ uncertainty at all radii , which is , of course , unfounded .",
    "details vary when more elaborate forms such as dd or f are used , but one is left essentially with _",

    "model - independent ' methods have been used in analyses of elastic scattering data for various projectiles @xcite to alleviate this problem . however , applying e.g. the fourier - bessel ( fb ) method in global analyses of kaonic atom data , one ends up with too few terms in the series , thus making the uncertainties unrealistic in their dependence on position .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : kbarnivr ] by the fb curve , obtained by adding a fourier - bessel series to a @xmath79 potential .",

    "[ fig : katfd ] where @xmath57 is a global parameter defined by @xmath54 , with @xmath55 and @xmath56 the radius and diffuseness parameters , respectively , of a 2pf charge distribution . from the figure",
    "it can be inferred that the sensitive region for the real @xmath79 potential is between @xmath100 and @xmath101 whereas for the f potential it is between @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "recall that @xmath104 corresponds to 90% of the central charge density and @xmath105 corresponds to 10% of that density .",
    "it therefore becomes clear that within the @xmath79 potential there is no sensitivity to the interior of the nucleus whereas with the density - dependent f potential , which yields greatly improved fit to the data , there is sensitivity to regions within the full nuclear density .",
    "the different sensitivities result from the potentials themselves : for the @xmath84 potential the interior of the nucleus is masked essentially by the strength of the imaginary potential .",
    "in contrast , for the f potential not only is its imaginary part significantly smaller than the imaginary part of the @xmath84 potential @xcite but also the additional attraction provided by the deeper potential enhances the _ atomic _ wavefunctions within the nucleus @xcite thus creating the sensitivity at smaller radii .",
    "as seen in the figure , the functional derivative for the complex f potential is well approximated by that for its real part .",
    "the optical potentials derived from the observed strong - interaction effects in kaonic atoms are sufficiently deep to support deeply - bound antikaon _ nuclear _ states , but it does not necessarily imply that such states are sufficiently narrow to be resolved unambiguously from experimental spectra . moreover , choosing between the very shallow chirally motivated potentials @xcite , the intermediate chiral potentials of depth around 100 mev  @xcite or the deep phenomenological potentials of type f adds appreciable ambiguity to predictions made for such states .",
    "it should also be kept in mind that these depths relate to @xmath4 potentials at _ threshold _ , whereas the information required for @xmath4-nuclear quasibound states is at energies of order 100 mev below threshold .",

    "the general physics behind this phenomenon is similar to that responsible for the deeply - bound pionic atom states , although there are differences in the underlying mechanisms .",
    "the mechanism behind the pionic atom deeply bound states is simply the _ repulsive _ real part of the @xmath22-wave potential which expels the atomic wavefunction @xmath110 from the nucleus , thus reducing the overlap between @xmath110 and the imaginary potential .",
    "this reduction , according to @xmath111 results in a reduced width for atomic states .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) holds _ exactly _ for a schrdinger equation , with only small changes for a kg equation , see refs .  @xcite .",
