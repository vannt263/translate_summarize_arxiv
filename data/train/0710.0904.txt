    "the idea that globular clusters ( gcs ) harbour important clues in relation with the early stages of galaxy formation is a widely accepted concept .",
    "one of the most compelling arguments in favour of the existence of a connection between gcs and major star formation episodes in the life of a galaxy is the constant cluster formation efficiency , defined in terms of total baryonic mass @xcite , in different galaxies .",
    "however , breaking the code that leads to a detailed quantitative link between gcs and the underlying `` diffuse '' stellar population is still an open question .",
    "such a connection has been discussed on theoretical ( e.g. @xcite or , more recently , @xcite ) and observational grounds ( e.g. @xcite ) . in the particular case of milky way gcs , @xcite found that the chemical similarities between clusters and field stars with @xmath6\\le -1 $ ] suggests a shared chemical history in a well mixed early galaxy .",
    "clarifying this issue may certainly yield some arguments in favour ( or against ) some predominant ideas that have been widely referenced in the literature ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) and later explored within the frame of different scenarios ( e.g. @xcite , or @xcite ) .",
    "a good perspective of the complex situation in this context is given in the thorough review by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "an initial confrontation between gcs and halo stellar populations shows more differences than similarities : a ) in general , gcs exhibit more shallow spatial distributions than those characterising galaxy light ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) ; b ) there is a colour offset in the sense that mean integrated globular colours appear bluer than those of the galaxy halos at the same galactocentric radius ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ; c ) gcs show frequently bimodal colour ( and hence , metallicity ) distributions ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "this feature does not seem exactly shared by the resolved stellar populations in nearby resolved galaxies ( see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite or @xcite ) .    as discussed later in this work ,",
    "those differences arise , mainly , from the fact that gcs analysis usually provide * number * weighted statistics while galaxy halos observations yield * luminosity * weighted measurements .",
    "a preliminary quantitative approach to the globulars - stellar halo connection was presented in @xcite ( hereafter ffg05 ) .",
    "this last paper shows that , given the areal density distribution of the `` blue '' and `` red '' globular cluster subpopulations in ngc 1339 , the galaxy surface brightness profile , galactocentric colour gradient and cumulative gcs specific frequency , can be matched by linearly weighting the areal density profiles .",
    "the `` weight '' corresponding to each component of the brightness profile is the inverse of the * intrinsic * gcs frequency characteristic of each cluster population .",
    "the main argument behind that approach is that the shape of the colour ( and metallicity ) distribution of each globular cluster subpopulation does not change with galactocentric radius .",
    "large angular scale studies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) in fact show that the colour peaks in the gcs colour statistics of ngc 1399 keep the same position ( or show very little variation ) over large galactocentric ranges .",
    "a similar result is obtained for ngc 4486 by @xcite who find those peaks do not show a detectable variation in colour over 75 kpc in galactocentric radius .",
    "it must be stressed that those subpopulations are `` phenomenologically '' defined in terms of their integrated colours but each might eventually have a given spread in age and/or metallicity .    the presence of a `` valley '' in the globular colour statistics is usually adopted as a discriminating boundary between both subpopulations .",
    "the need to revise such a procedure was already suggested by figure 5 in ffg05 .",
    "this last diagram showed that the ngc 1399 gcs bluer than the blue peak have a distinct behaviour of the areal density profile , exhibiting a flat core that disappears when all `` blue '' clusters ( i.e. all gcs bluer than the colour valley ) are included in the sample .",
    "that result prompted for a further analysis as discussed below .",
    "this paper generalises the ffg05 approach trough monte - carlo based models . in this frame ,",
    "`` seed '' globulars are generated following a given abundance z distribution and then associated with a `` diffuse '' stellar mass that shares its age , chemical composition and statistical spatial distribution .",
    "the luminosity associated with this mass is derived from a mass to luminosity ratio adequate for a given age and metallicity .",
    "these models aim at reproducing the features mentioned above and seek for a function that could link gcs and diffuse stellar populations keeping a minimum number of free parameters .    both ngc 1399 and ngc 4486 appear as adequate targets in order to perform such a modelling due to their prominent globular cluster systems ( gcs ) .",
    "although these systems show some structural similarities in terms of their spatial distribution , they also differ markedly both in the shape of their gcs colour statistics and specific frequencies @xcite .",
    "this work also presents new washington photometry , obtained and handled in a homogeneous way , that allows for a re - discussion of the gcs properties in the inner region of both galaxies and , in particular , of the behaviour of the areal density of gcs with colour . in turn , recent wide field photometric studies of the gcs associated with ngc 1399 @xcite and ngc 4486 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , are well suited for extending the analysis to larger galactocentric radii .",
    "photometric observations were carried out with the mayall and blanco 4-m telescopes at kpno and ctio respectively and 2048 pixels on a side ccds , with a pixel scale of 0.43 arcsecs .",
    "the c filter from the washington system @xcite and the r@xmath7 filter of the kron - cousins system were used at both telescopes . as noted by @xcite",
    "this last filter is comparable to the t@xmath0 filter in the washington system although much more efficient in terms of transmission . in what follows",
    "we keep the t@xmath0 denomination for our red magnitudes .",
    "two r@xmath7 images ( exposure : 600 secs each ) and three c images ( exposure : 1500 secs each ) were secured for both galaxy fields .",
    "seeing quality for these frames varied between 1.0 and 1.6 arcsec .",
    "these images were processed with the ccdred routines within iraf including bias and flat fielding .",
    "the galaxy background removal was performed with routins included in the vista image prossesing systems .",
    "psf photometry on all the frames was then carried out using the allframe version of the daophot package ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the instrumental photometry was transformed to the standard system using calibration standard stars from @xcite .",
    "image classification , in terms of resolved and non - resolved objects , was performed as in @xcite . briefly , that procedure combined the use of the round and sharpness parameters defined in daophot and also the mirrored envelope of the t@xmath0 psf allframe magnitude vs. the difference between this magnitude and that obtained using aperture photometry for every object detected on the images .",
    "non - resolved objects brighter than t@xmath8 and with ( c - t@xmath0 ) colours between 0.9 and 2.3 were considered as cluster candidates and their distribution on the sky is depicted in figure [ sample_sky ] .",
    "circles with r=120 and 420 arcsec delineate the area used for the analysis of the surface density distributions in the inner regions of the galaxies .",
    "figure [ p_error ] shows the errors on the ( c - t@xmath0 ) colours as a function of t@xmath0 magnitude as delivered by daophot . a median error for the ( c - t@xmath0 ) colours of @xmath9 0.07 mags .",
    "is reached at t@xmath8 , which is adopted in what follows as the limiting magnitude of the analysis in order to assure good quality colours .",
    "the photometric data for both galaxies , table [ phot_data1399 ] and [ phot_data4486 ] , are available in the electronic journal version .",
    "coordinates are referred to the galaxy centers and defined as in figure [ sample_sky ]    .photometric data ngc 1399 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     addstars experiments were carried out to estimate the completeness of the non - resolved objects ( which is expected to be the case for gcs at the distances of ngc 1399 and ngc 4486 from the sun ) .",
    "ten images , adding 1000 artificial stars each , on both c and t@xmath0 master images , yielded a completeness of 94 and 96% at t@xmath8 , for ngc 1399 and ngc 4486 respectively .    a comparison field of 77.7 arcmin@xmath10 was taken from @xcite who performed c and t@xmath0 photometry following the same procedure .",
    "this field has 146 non - resolved objetcs within the colour - magnitude boundaries adopted for the globular cluster candidates .",
    "the t@xmath0 vs. ( c - t@xmath0 ) colour diagrams for non - resolved objects are displayed in figure [ cmd_1399_4486 ] .",
    "the limiting magnitude t@xmath8 is indicated as a horizontal line while vertical lines at ( c - t@xmath0)=0.90 and ( c - t@xmath0)=2.30 define the domain of the globular cluster candidates .",
    "a distinctive feature in the lower panel of figure [ cmd_1399_4486 ] , in contrast with the upper panel of the same figure , is a noticeable tilt of the colours of the blue clusters associated with ngc 4486 , which is not detectable in the case of ngc 1399 .",
    "the tilted line figure [ cmd_1399_4486 ] ( lower panel ) was obtained by fitting the modal values on a smoothed image of the colour magnitude diagram ( adopting a round gaussian kernel of 0.05 mags . ) yielding :    @xmath11    this relation implies a 0.06 mags .",
    "( c - t@xmath0 ) colour increase per magnitude that is comparable to that detectable in the ( g - z ) colours of 0.045 per magnitude @xcite .",
    "the possible reason for the presence of a `` blue '' tilt in the colour magnitude diagram is discussed in section [ cn4486 ] .",
    "the ( c - t@xmath0 ) colour histograms for gcs within a circular galactocentric region defined between 120 and 360 arcsec are depicted in figure [ histos ] .",
    "these histograms have been corrected for background contamination by subtracting the comparison field histogram ( scaled by area and also shown in these figures ) and contain about 1000 and 1800 candidate gcs for both galaxies , respectively .    in order to minimise the presence of bright objects that might be identified as compact dwarfs ( see @xcite ) we adopted an upper cut off at t@xmath0=21.0 .",
    "we stress that @xcite noted that ngc 1399 cluster candidates brighter than this magnitude exhibit a unimodal colour distribution , a feature later confirmed in @xcite . as a reference we point out that omega cen - like objects would appear at t@xmath0 @xmath12 21.4 and 21.0 for ngc 1399 and ngc 4486 , respectively .",
    "these last figures also indicate the position of the so called `` colour valleys '' at ( c - t@xmath0)=1.55 and 1.52 for ngc 1399 and ngc 4486 respectively . these values were determined using gaussian smoothed colour histograms with a colour kernel of 0.05 mags .",
    "the same procedure leads to ( c - t@xmath0)=1.26 and 1.21 for the blue peaks and ( c - t@xmath0)= 1.75 and 1.72 for the red peaks in both galaxies .",
    "in this section we describe each of the steps involved in the model an the main hypothesis behind it , namely :    1 .",
    "the decomposition of the colour histograms in terms of the cluster subpopulations leading to their [ z / h ] , [ fe / h ] and ( c - t@xmath0 ) colour distributions .",
    "2 .   the determination of the projected areal density distribution for each of the cluster subpopulations .",
    "3 .   establishing the link between each cluster and its associated diffuse stellar population .",
    "4 .   deriving the parameters that determine the shape of the predicted galaxy surface brightness profile .",
    "\\a ) the decomposition of the colour histograms .",
    "the first step is the decomposition of the the observed colour histograms shown in figure [ histos ] avoiding an _ a priori _ functional dependence ( e.g. , the usual gaussian assumption ) .",
    "it must be emphasised that , matching the two - peaked colour histograms observed both in ngc 1399 and ngc 4486 through the adopted colour - metallicity relation ( see below ) , necessarily requires * two distinct * globular cluster populations.``seed '' clusters were then randomly generated in the abundance z domain according to a given statistical dependence .",
    "trial and error shows that exponential behaviours * @xmath13 $ ] * where * @xmath14 * is the * abundance scale length * and * @xmath15 * is the minimum abundance , provides acceptable fits to the observed histograms ( i.e. , within the poissonian uncertainties associated with each statistical bin ) .",
    "some more complex functions can not be rejected but would imply a larger number of free parameters not justified in terms of those uncertainties .    as for the minimum abundance , we adopted @xmath16 , that corresponds to @xmath6=-2.65 $ ] in the metallicity scale presented below .",
    "as discussed later , a dependence of @xmath15 with t@xmath0 leads to a blue tilt that reproduces the colour - magnitude diagram of the ngc 4486 gcs .",
    "the decomposition procedure aims at matching the position of the colour peaks and colour valley while keeping a minimum value of the quality index of the fit , @xmath17 , defined as in @xcite .    the cluster abundance @xmath18 was linked to metallicity on the zinn and west ( 1984 ) scale .",
    "the adoption of the [ fe / h]zw scale imply some caveats ( see for example , @xcite or @xcite ) about the nature of this index . in this work we use the relation found by @xcite for the stellar population models given by @xcite :    @xmath19zw = [ z / h]-0.131\\ ] ]    an integrated colour",
    "was then obtained for each cluster through an empirical ( c - t@xmath0)-[fe / h ] colour - metallicity calibration .",
    "several approach have been made in the past aiming at determining the colour metallicity relation .",
    "for example , the original linear relation found by @xcite for mw clusters was later improved by @xcite .",
    "being an important step in the modelling process , we attempted a new calibration , described in section [ cmc ] , which yields a quadratic relationship between metallicity and integrated cluster colours .    before comparing the model cluster colours with the observed histograms , we added interstellar reddenings , ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 for ngc 1399 and ngc 4486 , respectively ) from the @xcite maps , adopting @xmath22 , and gaussian errors matching their behaviour as a function of cluster brightness displayed in figure [ p_error ] .",
    "examples of the decomposition procedure are shown in figures [ model_f1 ] and [ model_f2 ] .",
    "the first diagram displays the results obtained from fitting the kernel colour distribution of gcs belonging to the brightest galaxies sample in the virgo acs ( @xcite ; figure 5 ) .",
    "these galaxies are comparable in brightness to both ngc 1399 and ngc 4486 .",
    "the parameters of the best fit are @xmath23 for the blue clusters ( 23% of the total population ) and @xmath24 for the red clusters . in this case",
    ", we transformed the ( c - t@xmath0 ) colours to ( g - z ) by adopting :    @xmath25",
    "this colour transformation is consistent with the colour of the peaks in the acs bright galaxies sample compared to our estimate of the ( c - t@xmath0 ) peaks in figure [ histos ] and also with the colours relation derived from the @xcite models .",
    "figure [ model_f2 ] shows the best fit obtained for 91 mw globulars with ( c - t@xmath0 ) colours ( from @xcite ) or ( b - i ) colours ( transformed according to @xmath26 ) in @xcite . in this case , 70% are assigned to the blue clusters subpopulation , with @xmath27 , and the remaining 30% to the red one , with @xmath28 .",
    "these parameters imply [ fe / h ] peaks at -1.7 and -0.5 , respectively .",
    "the small sample of mw clusters has large statistical uncertainties but the fit is consistent with the observed shape of the [ fe / h ] distribution ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "+ b ) projected spatial distributions .",
    "the model assumes that each of the gcs subpopulations has its own and distinctive spatial distribution . as noted before , however , the adoption of a given colour window to define each cluster subpopulation , leads to ambiguous results in the case of ngc 1399 .",
    "this particular aspect is discussed with more detail in section [ gcpadd ] on the basis of the photometry presented in this paper .",
    "in particular , we stress that the variation of the slope observed for the blue gcs ( depending on the colour window adopted as their domain ) may arise as a partial superposition of the two cluster subpopulations .",
    "+ c ) the gcs - diffuse stellar population link .    @xcite introduced the * t * parameter , defined as the total number of gcs per galaxy stellar mass unit . in this work ,",
    "we generalise that parameter by assuming that the number of globular clusters per associated diffuse stellar mass t is a function of total abundance [ z / h ] . after exploring different possible functions",
    ", we adopted : @xmath1)$ ] ( i.e. t increases when abundance decreases ) , and then :    @xmath29=t([z / h ] ) m([z / h ] ) \\label{f1}\\ ] ]    where dn is the number of cgs associated with a stellar mass m and an abundance [ z / h ] that belongs to a given subpopulation .",
    "this assumption leads to a `` diffuse '' stellar mass per cluster with a given [ z / h ] :    @xmath30    and then to an integrated luminosity :    @xmath31    where ( m",
    "/ l ) is the mass - luminosity ratio characteristic for stars with the same age and metallicity of the `` seed '' globular cluster .    in this work we adopted the ( m / l ) ratio for the b ( johnson ) band given by @xcite and an age of 12 gy .",
    "this ratio can be approximated as    @xmath32 + 2.0)^{2.5 } \\label{f4}\\ ] ]    this approximation differs from the worthey s ( m / l ) ratios by , at most , @xmath33 .",
    "note that we adopt [ z / h ] instead of [ fe / h ] as worthey s models assume solar scaled metallicities .",
    "a comparison with other models gives an idea about the uncertainty in this ratio .",
    "for example , models in @xcite , for the same age and a salpeter luminosity function , show an overall agreement better than @xmath34 with worthey s except at the lowest abundance where they deliver a ratio @xmath35 larger . the effect of age variations on this ratio is discussed below .",
    "in particular , we choose the b and r bands since large scale surface photometry is available for both ngc 1399 and ngc 4486 ( see sections [ cn1399 ] and [ cn4486 ] ) and no comparable data has been published in the c and t@xmath0 bands for both galaxies .",
    "although the @xmath36 ratio depends on age , we stress that most works ( e.g. @xcite ) have not detected significant age differences for the cluster subpopulations in ngc 4486 . in turn ,",
    "@xcite ( and also see @xcite ; @xcite or @xcite ) find arguments to support the presence of a fraction of `` intermediate age '' clusters in ngc 1399 and in other galaxies . however , age differences as large as @xmath9 2 gy will not have a strong impact on the integrated colours .",
    "+ d ) the shape and colour of the galaxy surface brightness profile .",
    "each stellar mass element associated with a given `` seed '' gc ( and determined by the adopted @xmath2 and @xmath3 parameters ) was split into a number of `` luminous '' particles ( i.e. 100 per cluster ) .",
    "these particles were statistically located on the plane of the sky by adopting the same spatial distribution that characterises each of the cluster subpopulations in order to construct bi - dimensional blue image ( 2 arcsec per pixel ) of the galaxies .",
    "a red image was also obtained by transforming the ( c - t@xmath0 ) colour of each luminous particle to ( b - r ) by means of :    @xmath37    empirically obtained from mw gcs with johnson @xcite and washington @xcite photometry .",
    "the synthetic b and r@xmath7 images were then analysed with the task ellipse within iraf in order to derive surface brightness profiles and colour gradients along the semi - major axis of the galaxies and , in the case of ngc 4486 , the variation of ellipticity along the same axis .",
    "this treatment generalises the profile expression given in ffg05 :    @xmath38 \\nonumber   \\\\",
    "\\big [ n(red)+\\frac{n(blue)}{c_b } \\big]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where n(blue ) , n(red ) are the areal densities of the blue and red clusters at a given galactocentric distance and @xmath39 . introducing the definition of the * t * parameter given before , leads to :    @xmath40_l}^{[z / h]_u } { \\frac{dn}{d[z / h ] }   \\frac{1.0}{(m / l ) } \\exp{\\{\\delta [ z / h]\\ } } d[z / h ] }   \\label{sn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the integrals are performed on the abundance domains covered by each cluster family and @xmath41=n^{-1 } dn / d[z / h]$ ] , being n the projected areal density of each gcs subpopulations at a given galactocentric radius , and @xmath41 $ ] comes from the histogram decomposition . note that the sn values do not change with galactocentric radius and are solely determined by the z distribution parameters of each cluster and associated stellar subpopulation ( which we also call `` blue '' and `` red '' in what follows ) .",
    "both @xmath2 and @xmath3 were iteratively changed in order to derive a surface brightness profile that minimises the rms of the residuals when confronted with the observed profiles at galactocentric distances larger than 120 arcsec .",
    "this last value was adopted since both gcs exhibit flat spatial density cores that contrast with the peaked shape of the galaxy surface brightness .",
    "these cores can be understood as the result of gravitational disruption effects that change the original population of gcs in the inner regions of galaxies ( see , for example , @xcite , and references therein ) and , presumably , become less important for cluster orbits with larger perigalactic values .",
    "we present a new colour metallicity relation based on 198 clusters that combines revised data for mw gcs and also metallicity data obtained for gcs in three other galaxies : ngc 3379 , ngc 3923 , and ngc 4649 ( @xcite ; @xcite , and norris et al .",

    "[ fe / h ] values for gcs in these galaxies were derived from lick indices given in the @xcite stellar population models .",

    "intrinsic colours for these globulars were then obtained by using colour excesses determined by @xcite , when available , or the @xcite values . as a result",
    "we obtain :    @xmath42    in turn , the extragalactic gcs were observed in the ( g - i ) sloan colour and transformed to ( c - t@xmath0 ) through two different ways .",
    "on one side using the ( g - i ) to ( b - i ) relation derived from model integrated colours given by @xcite and then to ( c - t@xmath0 ) through our own transformation , leading to :    @xmath43    alternatively , @xcite have calibrated the sloan indices in terms of johnson s colour indices that can be transformed to ( c - t@xmath0)@xmath44 ( see , for example , @xcite ) yielding :    @xmath45    as these transformations are very comparable , within errors , we adopted an average of both in order to obtain the extragalactic gcs colours on the ( c - t@xmath0 ) scale .",
    "the intrinsic colours for the extragalactic clusters , were derived by subtracting the interstellar reddening excess indicated by the @xcite maps and assuming @xmath46 .",

    "an analysis of colour residuals as a function of age ( for globular with ages available in @xcite ) or horizontal branch morphology , through the hb - index given by @xcite , reveals no trends with these quantities as displayed in figure [ w_fe_res ] .",
    "these results are in agreement with a similar analysis presented by @xcite , who discuss those effects for a number of different colour indices .",

    "this agreement is reached after subtracting a zero point difference of 0.065 mags . to their ( b - i ) model colours and then transforming to ( c - t@xmath0 ) through the relation given above .",
    "note that these models ( shown as triangles in figure [ w_fe_fig ] ) are given as a function of total abundance [ z / h ] .",

    "we also set a magnitude range ( t@xmath0=21.0 to 23.2 ) for two reasons .",

    "both gcs subpopulations have larger abundance scale lengths ( as defined in section 4 ) in ngc 1399 than in ngc 4486 leading to total mean abundance ratios of 1.4 and 2.5 for the red and blue gcs , respectively .",
    "as shown in figures 10 and 14 , the approach presented in this paper delivers gcs colour distributions that are not strongly different from a two gaussians fit requiring five free parameters , a common procedure in the literature ( e.g ostrov , forte & geisler 1998 ) .",
    "however , we note that our models indicate a lower ratio of the number of blue to red gcs and only require three free parameters .    blue gcs in ngc 4486 have a small abundance scale lenght , about four times smaller than that of the blue gcs in ngc 1399 , and we speculate that this may be connected with a shorter formation time scale . in turn , that lower abundance spread may be the reason behind the presence of a blue tilt , connected with cluster mass , in the colour magnitude diagram .",
    "this feature seems absent , or probably masked , by the larger abundance scale of the blue gcs in ngc 1399 , a situation that may also hold in other galaxies ( e.g. ngc 4472 , strader et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "this last result argues in favour of the idea that blue gcs `` know '' about the galaxy they are associated with ( @xcite ) . in any case , and in both galaxies , the blue gcs barely reach an abundance close to [ z / h]=-0.5 .",
    "the reason for this upper metallicity cut off may be connected with some kind of sincrhonising event as the re - ionisation of the universe ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the different abundance scale lengths of the blue gcs also suggest that a local phenomenon , distinct for each galaxy , may have also played a role in modulating the the star formation rate ( e.g. the onset of galaxy nuclear activity ) .",
    "the overall picture seems consistent with some scenarios already discussed in the literature ( @xcite ; @xcite ) that invoke two different cluster formation mechanisms and , probably , environmental conditions .",
    "in contrast with the relative abundance homogeneity and large spatial ( half density ) core radii ( @xmath12 25 kpc ) of the blue gcs , the red ones exhibit a large abundance heterogeneity and much smaller core radii ( @xmath12 5 kpc ) also shared by the red diffuse stellar population .",
    "this degree of heteregeneity may be connected , for example , to mergers of different nature ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the total globular cluster formation efficiencies , in terms of stellar mass , indicated by the models , and adopting an average cluster mass of @xmath95 , are @xmath96 for ngc 1399 and @xmath97 for ngc 4486 .",
    "they are comparable to the efficiency derived by @xcite although , in that case , the definition of efficiency included total baryonic mass .",
    "blue clusters show a higher formation efficiency ( in terms of the stellar mass they are associated with ) , when compared with the red ones , probably as a consequence of a lower star formation efficiency during the early phases of galaxy formation at a low metallicity regime .",
    "although there is no strong evidence of an age difference between the blue and red globular subpopulations ( e.g. @xcite ) within the uncertainties of the measurements , a possible temporal sequence that assumes the formation of the blue population first , can not be discarded as a result of the relatively small time scales involved at the early phases of galaxy formation ( see @xcite ) . in this frame",
    ", the chemical enrichment provided by a presumably progenitor blue population might be important to boost later stellar formation efficiency through an abundance enrichment that may reach @xmath98 \\approx $ ] -0.60 within 100 kpc of the galaxy nucleus .",
    "some scenarios suggest that blue gcs formation is associated with dark matter ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and it is tempting to look for such a connection . for example , the results listed in table [ model_values ] show that while both galaxies have a similar total number of red gcs , ngc 4486 outnumbers ngc 1399 in a factor of about 1.8 in terms of blue gcs .",
    "dark mass estimates within a galactocentric radius of 100 kpc are 3.4@xmath99 for ngc 1399 ( extrapolating data from @xcite ) and 7.4@xmath99 for ngc 4486 @xcite , leading to a ratio @xmath100 comparable to that in the number of blue gcs .",
    "the similarity of the stellar galaxy masses , and the difference in their total masses , had already been noticed by @xcite on the basis of their x ray analysis .",
    "ffg05 found that , adopting * their * definition of blue clusters , the density profiles of the ngc 1399 gcs could be fit with a nfw profile @xcite with a scale length of 375 arcsec , coincident with that derived for the inferred dark matter halo by @xcite .",
    "@xcite also perform a nfw profile fit to the blue clusters in ngc 4486 .",
    "however , both approaches deserve a revision since , on the basis of the results presented in this work , the `` genuine '' blue gcs exhibit a rather extended inner core in their surface density profiles .",
    "as shown here , these cores have been disguised by the inclusion of the blue tail of the red subpopulation within the `` blue '' gcs sample .",
    "this overlapping should be even more severe when using colour indices less sensitive to metallicity than ( c - t@xmath0 ) and should be taken into account when doing , for example , kinematic analysis of the cluster subpopulations .",
