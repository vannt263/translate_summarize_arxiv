    "an independent approach is to perform purely optical measurements on absolute rydberg level energies by observing electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite .",
    "however , there is a systematic discrepancy between variational calculations and the spectroscopic measurements of the fine splitting @xmath35 as shown in tables [ table i ] and [ table ii ] .",
    "given the fact that the error bars of the independent experiments @xcite are below down to , and on the other hand considering the high accuracy of the numerical calculations presented in @xcite , such a discrepancy between experiment and theory is indeed significant .",

    "[ fig : quasiclassical_momentum ] . clearly , it is the inner core region @xmath56 that provides the main contribution to the quantum defect values .",
    "we find , for @xmath57 , that changing the fitting parameter @xmath58 in ( [ effective potential ib ] ) from its tabulated value in @xcite according to the scaling prescription @xmath59 and @xmath60 , leads to a slight downward _ constant _ shift of the wkb - quantum defect . as a result of this change",

    "we discussed that the usual _ a posteriori _ adding of the relativistic spin - orbit potential to the effective single electron potential governing the outermost electron of alkali atoms is indeed inconsistent inside the inner atomic core region . in the absence of a full microscopic theory that lumps all many - body interactions together with the relativistic corrections into an effective single - electron potential in a consistent manner",
