    "time plays a special role in quantum mechanics . unlike other observables ,",
    "time remains a classical variable .",
    "it can not be simply quantized because , as it is well known , the self - adjoint operator of time does not exist for bounded hamiltonians .",
    "the problems with the time rise from the fact that in quantum mechanics many quantities can not have definite values simultaneously .",
    "the absence of the time operator makes this problem even more complicated .",
    "however , in practice the time often is important for an experimenter .",
    "if quantum mechanics can correctly describe the outcomes of the experiments , it must also give the method for the calculation of the time the particle spends in some region .",
    "the most - known problem of time in quantum mechanics is the so - called  tunneling time problem  .",
    "there had been many attempts to define physical time for quantum mechanical tunneling processes , since the question was raised by maccoll @xcite in 1932 .",
    "this question is still the subject of much controversy , since numerous theories contradict each other in their predictions for  the tunneling time  @xcite .",
    "we can raise another , more general , question about the time .",
    "let us consider a system which evolves with time .",
    "let @xmath0 is one of the observables of the system . during the evolution the value of @xmath0 changes .",
    "we are considering a subset @xmath1 of possible values of @xmath0 .",
    "the question is _ how much time the values of @xmath0 belong to this subset?_.    there is another version of the question .",
    "if we know the final state of the system , we may ask how much time the values of @xmath0 belong to the subset under consideration when the system evolves from the initial to the definite final state .",
    "the question about the tunneling time belongs to such class of the problems .",
    "really , in the tunneling time problem we ask about the duration the particle spends in a specified region of the space and we know that the particle has tunneled , i.e. , it is on the other side of the barrier .",
    "we can expect that such a question may not always be answered . here",
    "our goal is to obtain the conditions under which it is possible to answer such a question .",
    "one of the possibilities to solve the problem of time is to answer what exactly the word `` time '' means .",
    "the meaning of every quantity is determined by the procedure of measurement .",
    "therefore , we have to construct a scheme of an experiment ( this can be a _ gedanken _ experiment ) to measure the quantity with the properties corresponding to the classical time .    the experiment for the measurement of time must obey certain conditions .",
    "the time in classical mechanics describes not a single state of the system but the process of the evolution .",
    "this property is an essential concept of the time .",
    "we speak about the time belonging to a certain evolution of the system . if the measurement of the time disturbs the evolution we can not attribute this measured duration to the undisturbed evolution .",
    "therefore , we should require that the measurement of the time does not disturb the motion of the system .",
    "this means that the interaction of the system with the measuring device must be weak . in quantum mechanics",
    "this means that we can not use the strong measurements described by the von - neumann s projection postulate .",
    "we have to use the weak measurements of aharonov , albert and vaidman @xcite , instead .",
    "we proceed as follows : in secs .",
    "[ sec : mod ] and [ sec : mes ] , we present the model and the procedure of the time measurement , respectively . in sec .",
    "[ sec : condprob ] we modify the proposed procedure of the time measurement to make the distinction between different final states of the system .",
    "this procedure allows us to determine when the concept of the time with the known final state is correct in quantum mechanics . in sec .",
    "[ sec : exampl ] an example of application of our formalism for the two - level system is presented .",
    "section [ sec : concl ] summarizes our findings .",
    "we consider a system evolving with time .",
    "one of the quantities describing the system is @xmath0 .",
    "operator @xmath2 corresponds to this quantity . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the operator @xmath2 has a continuous spectrum .",
    "the case with discrete spectrum will be considered later .",
    "the measuring device interacts with the system only if @xmath0 is near some point @xmath3 , depending only on the detector .",
    "if we want to measure the time the system is in a large region of @xmath0 , we have to use many detectors . in the case of tunneling a similar model",
    "had been introduced by a.  m.  steinberg @xcite and developed in our paper @xcite .",
    "the strong limit of such a model for analysis of the measurement effect for the quantum jumps has been used in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in order the weak measurements can provide the meaningful information , the measurements have to be performed on an ensemble of identical systems .",
    "each system with its own detector is prepared in the same initial state .",
    "after time @xmath4 the readings of the detectors are collected and averaged .",
    "our model consists of the system * s * under consideration and of the detector * d*. the hamiltonian is @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the hamiltonians of the system and of the detector , respectively , and the operator @xmath8 represents the interaction between the system and the detector .",
    "the interaction term ( [ interact ] ) only slightly differs from the one used by aharonov , albert and vaidman @xcite .",
    "the operator @xmath9 acts in the hilbert space of the detector .",
    "we require a continuous spectrum of the operator @xmath9 . for simplicity , we can consider this operator as the coordinate of the detector .",
    "the operator @xmath10 acts in the hilbert space of the system . in an ideal case",
    "the operator @xmath11 can be expressed as @xmath12 function @xmath13 parameter @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ interact ] ) characterizes the strength of the interaction .",
    "a very small parameter @xmath14 ensures the undisturbance of the system s evolution .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ interact ] ) with @xmath15 given by ( [ delta ] ) represents the constant force acting on the detector * d * when the quantity @xmath0 is very close to the value @xmath16 .",
    "this force induces the change of the detector s momentum . from the classical point of view",
    ", the change of the momentum is proportional to the time the particle spends in the region around @xmath16 and the coefficient of proportionality equals to the force acting on the detector .",
    "we assume that the change of the mean momentum of the detector is proportional to the time the constant force acts on the detector and that the time the particle spends in the detector s region is the same as the time the force acts on the detector .",
    "we can replace the @xmath17 function by the narrow rectangle of the height @xmath18 and of the width @xmath19 in the @xmath0 space . from eq .",
    "( [ interact ] ) it follows that the force acting on the detector when the particle is in the region around @xmath16 is @xmath20 .",
    "the time the particle spends until time moment @xmath4 in the unit length region is @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the mean initial momentum and momentum after time @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "if we want to find the time the system spends in the region of the finite width , we have to add many times ( [ timedef ] ) .",
    "when the operator @xmath2 has a discrete spectrum , we may ask how long the quantity @xmath0 has the value @xmath16 . to answer this question",
    "the detector must interact with the system only when @xmath24 .",
    "in such a case the operator @xmath25 takes the form @xmath26 the force , acting on the detector in this case equals to @xmath27 .",
    "the time the quantity @xmath0 has the value @xmath16 is given by eq.([timedef ] ) , too .",
    "further formulae do not depend on the spectrum of the operator @xmath2 .    in the time moment",
    "@xmath28 the density matrix of the whole system is @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the density matrix of the system and @xmath31 is the density matrix of the detector with @xmath32 being the normalized vector in the hilbert space of the detector . after the interaction the density matrix of the detector is @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the evolution operator",
    "later on , for simplicity we will neglect the hamiltonian of the detector .",
    "then , the evolution operator approximately equals to the operator @xmath35 with @xmath36 being the solution of the equation @xmath37 after such assumptions we can obtain the dwell time for our model explicitly .",
    "we can expand the operator @xmath38 into the series of the parameter @xmath14 , assuming that @xmath14 is small . introducing the operator @xmath25 in the interaction representation @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the evolution operator of unperturbed system we obtain the first - order approximation for the operator @xmath41 , @xmath42 for shortening of the notation we introduce the operator @xmath43    from the density matrix of the detector after the measurement in the first - order approximation we find that the average change of the momentum of the detector during the time @xmath4 is @xmath44 .",
    "from eq .",
    "( [ timedef ] ) we obtain the dwell time until time moment @xmath4 , @xmath45 the time spent in the region @xmath1 is @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the probability for the system to have the value @xmath0 at time moment @xmath48 .    in the case when @xmath0 is the coordinate of the particle eq .",
    "( [ eq : dw ] ) yields the well - known expression for the dwell time @xcite .",
    "this time is the average over the entire ensemble of the systems , regardless of their final states .",
    "further we will consider the case when the final state of the system is known .",
    "we ask _ how much time the values of @xmath0 belong to the subset under consideration , @xmath1 , on condition that the system evolves to the definite final state @xmath49_. more generally , we might know that the final state of the system belongs to the certain subspace @xmath50 of system s hilbert space .    the projection operator which projects the vectors from the hilbert space of the system into the subspace @xmath50 of the final states is @xmath51 .",
    "as far as our model gives the correct result for the time averaged over the entire ensemble of the systems , we can try to take the average only over the subensemble of the systems with the given final states .",
    "we measure the momenta @xmath52 of each measuring device after the interaction with the system .",
    "subsequently we perform the final , postselection measurement on the systems of our ensemble .",
    "then we collect the outcomes @xmath53 only of the systems the final state of which turns out to belong to the subspace @xmath50 .    the joint probability that the state of the system belongs to @xmath54 _ and _ the detector has the momentum @xmath55 at the time moment @xmath4 is @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the eigenfunction of the momentum operator @xmath58 . in quantum mechanics",
    "the probability that two quantities simultaneously have definite values does not always exist . if the joint probability does not exist then the concept of the conditional probability is meaningless .",

    "this fact means that in such a case we can not obtain the _ definite _ value for the conditional time .",
    "moreover , the coefficient @xmath74 may be zero for the specific initial state of the detector , e.g. , for the gaussian distribution of the coordinate @xmath75 and momentum @xmath52 .",

    "we ask _ how much time the values of @xmath0 belong to the certain subset when the system evolves to the given final state_. we know with certainty the final state of the system .",
    "in addition , we want to have some information about the values of the quantity @xmath0 . however , if we know the final state with certainty , we may not know the values of @xmath0 in the past and , vice versa , if we know something about @xmath0 , we may not definitely determine the final state .",
    "therefore , in such a case the question about the time when the system evolves to the given final state can not be answered definitely and the conditional time has no reasonable meaning .",
    "the quantity @xmath77 according to eqs.([condtime ] ) and ( [ timere ] ) has many properties of the classical time .",
