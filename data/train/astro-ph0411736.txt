    "according to our current understanding of stellar evolution , all stars with main sequence progenitors in the mass range 1 - 8@xmath2 , evolve via the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase to the planetary nebula ( pn ) stage .",
    "the early agb ( e - agb ) phase begins as soon as the star finishes burning he in its core and begins to burn he in a thick shell .",
    "when both h and he burning shells are active , the star enters in the thermally pulsating agb ( tp - agb ) phase ( iben & renzini 1983 ; blcker 1999 ) .",
    "the agb phase is characterized by a strong mass - loss period that only stops when the outer envelope is completely lost ( habing 1996 ) . as the star ascends the agb , the mass - loss rate increases from solar - like values ( @xmath3 ) up to @xmath4 , the so - called super - wind phase .",
    "dust grains and molecules , predominantly co , are formed in the wind , producing a circumstellar envelope detectable in the infrared and millimetric domains .",
    "although the radiation pressure on dust grains and on molecules is thought to play an important role in the driving mechanism of the wind , different physical aspects governing the dust formation / destruction processes are still unclear .",
    "processed elements are dredged - up into the atmosphere as a consequence of the re - ignition of the he burning shell ( e - agb phase ) .",
    "a further contraction leads also to the re - ignition of the h burning shell and the star enters a tp - agb phase .",
    "a third dredge - up may take place during this phase and overshooting will contribute to lift carbon to the surface .",
    "these events lead to the formation of circumstellar envelopes whose chemical composition reflects that of an atmosphere enriched with nuclear processed matter .",
    "c - rich stars have envelopes composed mainly of amorphous carbon while o - rich stars have circumstellar envelopes rich in silicates . both oxidic and carbonaceous",
    "dust particles are characterized by vibrational bands positioned in the mid - ir window ( at 9.7@xmath0 m and 18@xmath0 m for silicates and at 11.3@xmath0 m for sic ) ( henning 1999 ) .",
    "most of the thermal radiation continuum from the dusty envelope is emitted in this wavelength range .",
    "mid - infrared imaging allow direct probe of the mass distribution through thermal emission arising from dust grains .",
    "therefore a number of imaging studies of agb and post - agb stars have been made at mid - infrared wavelengths and some emission regions have been resolved ( dayal et al .",
    "1998 ; meixner et al . 1999 ; ueta et al .",

    "2002a , b ; kwok et al . 2002 ; close et al . 2003 ; gledhill & yates 2003 ) .    in the present work we report mid - infrared imaging , with a spatial resolution of about 0.7 , of a sample of agb and post - agb carbon - rich stars ( cit6 , vhya , roberts22 and irc+10216 ) not previously imaged at these wavelengths .",
    "our goals are to derive physical properties of the dust inside the circumstellar envelope and to estimate mass - loss rates .",
    "most of the objects have circumstellar envelopes nearly symmetric , allowing the use of inversion techniques to obtain the dust emissivity and , consequently , the density and the temperature as a function of the radial distance from the star .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  2 , observations and data reduction are described ; in section  3 , morphological analyzes of the individual objects are presented ; in section  4 , we describe our model for the envelope and present the derived dust density and temperature profiles ; in section  5 we discuss our results and compare with previous works ; finally , in section  6 , the main conclusions are given .",
    "observations were performed on 1995 february 5 , 7 at the eso 3.6-m telescope in la silla ( chile ) , using the mid - infrared timmi camera ( lagage et al .",
    "1993 ) with a detector consisting of a @xmath5 pixel ga : si array .",
    "the resulting spatial scale of the system is 0.33/pix .",
    "the log of the observations is given in table [ tab_log ] .",
    "these observations were made in a standard mid - ir observing mode , by chopping the secondary mirror and nodding the telescope to subtract the background emission from the sky and telescope .",
    "the chopper throw was 18.3 toward the south and the nod beam position used was 18.3 north of the first position . to avoid the saturation of the detector by the ambient photon background and to have a good image quality , each individual nod cycle",
    "was split into many short exposures of @xmath110ms .",
    "this procedure was repeated for as many cycles as needed to obtain the required total integration time .",
    "nearly diffraction - limited images ( @xmath6 fwhm for point sources ) resulted from these short exposures .",
    "filter wavelengths were selected in order to obtain information on the dust continuum , while maximizing the detection sensitivity .",
    "the observations were carried out in four narrow - band filters , centered respectively at 8.39(n1 ) , 9.7(silicates ) , 9.78(n2 ) , and 11.65@xmath0m(sic ) whose characteristics are given in table [ table_filtre ] . during",
    "the different runs the seeing was typically 0.7 - 0.8 .",
    "data reduction was performed using idl self - developed routines .",
    "individual chopped frames were spatially oversampled by a factor of 4 and shifted to the nearest 0.25 pixel by using a cross - correlation algorithm to correct for turbulent motions and flexure drifts .",
    "images were then co - added to produce a single flat - field - corrected image , comprising the average of the chop and nod differences , for each filter .",
    "reference stars were observed , analyzed in the same way and were used to derive the instrumental point spread function ( psf ) at each filter .",
    "images were deconvolved by using the maximum entropy method ( hollis et al .",
    "1992 ) and fluxes were obtained by interpolation of iras - lrs data .",

    "the large infrared excess ( van der veen & habing 1988 ) as well as the strong emission in molecular lines indicate that vhya is losing mass at a rate higher than @xmath8 .",
    "knapp et al . ( 1997 ) detected , via co observations , a fast molecular wind ( @xmath9 ) expanding from the poles of the envelope and having an increasing velocity with the distance from the star . from recent hst observations ,",
    "sahai et al . (",
    "2003 ) report the discovery of a newly ejected high - speed jet - like outflow in this star .",
    "these observations , combined with a previous interferometric co ( j=1 - 0 ) map of vhya , favor the picture of an expanding , tilted and dense disk - like structure , oriented north - south present inside the inner envelope .",
    "we obtained images of vhya at 9.78 and 11.65@xmath10 ( n2 and sic filters respectively ) .",
    "images are roughly spherically symmetric in the central parts of the envelope but isophotes become slightly elongated in the south - west direction at intensity levels lower than 20% of the central value .",
    "the n2-image has an extension at 2% intensity level of @xmath11 whereas in the sic filter the dimension is @xmath12 ( fig .",
    "[ figvhya ] ) .",
    "the observed elongated feature in the south - west direction could be associated to the dust emission from material blown away perpendicular to the equatorial disk , consistent with the model proposed by sahai et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .    using the method proposed by dayal et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , we derived a color map ( 9.78 and 11.65@xmath0 m filters ) for vhya , which gives an indication of the mean dust temperature along the line of sight , weighted by the density distribution ( fig .",
    "[ color_temp_vhya ] ) .",
    "the meaning of such an average temperature is discussed in some more detail in section4 .",
    "one striking aspect of the color map is that the maximum is off - centered .",
    "if we perform a cut in the color map along the direction defined by the center of the envelope ( the peak intensity coincides in both filters ) and the color maximum ( fig . [ cutvhya ] ) , we observe three distinct peaks : a fainter one at @xmath13 east from the center ; a slightly higher peak at the center of the envelope and a still higher peak at @xmath13 west from the center .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the direction of this cut is approximately the same as that of the jet observed by sahai et al .",
    "( 2003 ) through the [ s  ii ] emission as well as inferred from interferometric co ( j=1 - 0 ) maps .",
    "notice that the epoch of these observations correspond to 2002 and 1998 respectively .",
    "the jet observed by sahai et al .",
    "( 2003 ) has a characteristic expansion timescale of @xmath14 years and an opening angle of @xmath15-@xmath16sin@xmath17 .",
    "the estimated timescale suggests that the events observed in 1998 and 2002 are probably not the same .",
    "thus , they suggested that vhya undergoes periodic mass ejection events along a direction perpendicular to the equatorial disk .",
    "our color map corresponds to data obtained in 1995 , prior to the aforementioned events .",
    "if we assume an expansion velocity of @xmath18 and a distance of 340pc , we find an expansion timescale of @xmath19yr ( the peaks we observe are offset by 0.9 from the center and have an opening angle of roughly @xmath20sin@xmath17 ) .",
    "this timescale suggests that we are observing a material ejected in a previous mass - loss episode and it is also consistent with the 12yr period over which the high - velocity [ sii ] emission has been observed and monitored from 1989 up to 2000 ( lloyd evans 2000 ) .",
    "roberts22 ( iras10197 - 5750 ) is an optical ( @xmath21 ) bipolar proto - planetary nebula ( ppn ) , whose circumstellar dust envelope absorbs totally the light emitted by its central star ( allen et al .",
    "this object is also an oh maser source displaying strong emission at 1612 and 1665mhz , indicating that the circumstellar envelope expands with a velocity of about @xmath22 .",
    "optical spectroscopy shows that the @xmath23 line profile has wings extending up to @xmath24 , a signature of high - speed outflow .",
    "the bipolar shape of roberts22 is confirmed by hst observations .",
    "these observations show also a dust waist oriented along p.a .",
    "of 121@xmath25 , which darkens the central star and separates the polar lobes ( sahai et al .",
    "it is interesting to note that roberts22 display thin shell structures as seen in many ppn ( e.g. crl2688 ) , which could be due to discrete mass - loss episodes ; in addition , a striking aspect of roberts22 is that c - rich and o - rich spectral features are seen as in the case of red rectangle nebula ( waters et al .",
    "a possible explanation is that the o - rich material is a remnant of an earlier mass - loss event that occurred when the envelope of the star was o - rich , followed by the capture and formation of a disk - like structure around a companion , the c - rich material being ejected in a late evolutionary phase , when the star atmosphere became c - rich .",

    "after six years of monitoring these structures , the onset of a fast wind phase is hardly suggested ( weigelt et al .",

    "these clumpy structures seems to be consistent with the expectations of the interacting stellar winds model ( isw ) of kwok et al .",

    "however , to our knowledge , no direct mid - infrared images have been published in the literature . here",

    "it is a long - period - variable star with a period of @xmath32 days ( e.g. alksnis 1995 ) , and was classified as ppn by johnson & jones ( 1991 ) .",
    "however , the estimated photospheric temperature of @xmath12800k ( cohen 1979 ) implies that the star is still near the agb .",
    "visible and infrared polarization measurements show that the light at these wavelengths is highly polarized , with a strong variation of the polarization angle with the wavelength , indicating that the distribution of the circumstellar material around this star is asymmetric ( trammell et al .",
    "1994 and references therein ) .",
    "cit6 has been observed with a @xmath150mas spatial resolution at 2.2@xmath0 m and 3.1@xmath0 m , using aperture masking techniques at the kecki telescope ( monnier et al .",
    "the object was resolved into two main components : a bright elongated feature showing shape variations ( north component ) and a fainter bluer ( south ) component about 66mas away .",
    "the observed shape variations suggest an evolution of the dust envelope , which can be explained by changes in the illumination pattern .",
    "cit6 was also observed with wfpc2 aboard the hst , through the filters f439w(0.429@xmath0 m ) , f555w(0.525@xmath0 m ) , and f675w(0.674@xmath0 m ) .",
    "both components are seen in f675w and f555w images while in the f439w image only the south component is seen .",
    "these observations are consistent with a binary star scenario where the north component presents a 640 day pulsation period not seen in the south component , probably a main sequence a - f star .",
    "associated to the latter , a cometary - like feature extending along the south - west direction can be seen in the 3.1@xmath0 m images ( monnier et al . 2000 ) .",
    "recently , schmidt et al . (",
    "2002 ) concluded from hst imaging , ground - based spectroscopy and spectropolarimetric observations , that a third closely coupled companion would be required to explain the bipolar morphology of this star .",
    "here we report the first mid - infrared imaging of cit6 at 8.39@xmath10(n1 ) and 9.7@xmath10(silicates ) . the cometary - like feature",
    "is clearly seen in the 9.7@xmath0 m image ( fig .",

    "@xmath34 ( the north and south components seen in the near infrared are not resolved in our images ) .",
    "this cometary - like feature which is less extended and less prominent in the 8.4@xmath0 m image compares well with pictures at 3.1@xmath0 m ( monnier et al .",
    "2000 ) and is roughly orthogonal to the extended structure seen in the f439w hst image .",
    "the morphology of cit6 seen in the optical and near - infrared domains can qualitatively be explained if the bipolar nebula is essentially seen through its scattered light .",
    "the central star is obscured by a central disk or torus of dust .",
    "the dominance of the northern pole observed in the near - infrared indicates an inclination toward us ( monnier et al .",
    "this picture is supported by linear polarization data in the infrared but it does not account for the cometary shape seen in blue wfpc2 images ( trammell et al .",
    "1994 ) and in our mid - infrared images .",
    "no satisfactory flux calibration of our images was obtained .",
    "in spite of the presence of some asymmetries in the outer envelope of these objects , here we consider a spherical geometry as a first approximation to derive the temperature and the density profiles of the circumstellar dust around vhya and irc+10216 .",
    "roberts22 and cit6 were excluded from our modeling , since the former has at least two emission components and the latter shows clearly elongated isophotes .",
    "our procedure is the following : in a first step , from the isophotal contours we derive the equivalent radius @xmath35 defined by the relation @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the area delimited by the isophote of intensity @xmath38 .",
    "* , where _",
    "i _ is the intensity received and _ j _ the emissivity of the dust grains . ]",
    "if the outer nebular light at @xmath110@xmath0 m is dominated by the emission of warm dust grains and if the nebula is optically thin at these wavelengths , then the intensity at a projected distance @xmath35 from the center is    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the outer radius of the dust envelope and @xmath41 is the dust emission coefficient , which is a function of the distance @xmath42 from the star .",
    "the equation above can easily be written under the form of an abel integral , whose inversion method is quite well known .",
    "therefore , the dust emission coefficient is given by    @xmath43    on the other hand , from its definition , the dust emissivity can explicitly be written as    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the dust grain density , @xmath46 is the dust grain mean square radius , @xmath47 is the emission ( absorption ) efficiency and @xmath48 is the planck s function at the grain temperature @xmath49 .",
    "if the dust emissivity is derived at two different wavelengths @xmath50 and @xmath51 , then their ratio is simply @xmath52    the grain temperature can be derived from eqs.(2 ) and ( 4 ) if we assume a given chemical composition and dimension for the dust grains .",
    "once the temperature distribution is obtained , the grain density can be evaluated from eq.(3 ) .",
    "notice that larger is the difference between @xmath50 and @xmath51 , higher is the accuracy in the determination of the temperature distribution and the grain density .",
    "the emission efficiency of the grains @xmath47 was computed using the mie s theory , assuming homogeneous and spherical grains constituted of amorphous carbon with a mass density of @xmath53 .",

    "1998 , hereafter respectively model 1 , 2 and 3 ) .",
    "the choice of dust parameters is somewhat arbitrary , since there are no strong observational constraints on them .",
    "thus , grain dimensions were chosen to be comparable to those adopted in previous studies , whenever existent .    for numerical reasons , in order to invert the abel integral , we preferred to adopt an analytical representation for the intensity @xmath38 derived from our data .",
    "in fact , the function @xmath54 represents quite well the observed intensity profiles .",
    "the resulting fit parameters for the different objects are shown in table ( [ table_param ] ) .    to verify the consistency of our assumption , namely , an optically thin envelope at the considered wavelength , the optical depth at 11.6@xmath0 m was computed from the equation below and the derived density distribution .",
    "@xmath55    grains sizes ranging from 0.007@xmath0 m up to 5@xmath0 m and dust optical properties taken from models 1 , 2 and 3 were used .",
    "the derived optical depth values ( table [ tabletau ] ) are consistent with the hypothesis of an envelope optically thin at @xmath110@xmath0 m , since for all models @xmath56 . as an additional check , other flux values in the interval",
    "8 - 12@xmath0 m were computed and compared with iras data . the good agreement between expected and observed values reinforce the basic assumption of our model .",
    "color maps are usually interpreted as `` temperature maps '' ( dayal et al .",

    "however color inhomogeneities are also detected , which should be interpreted as temperature variations along the line of sight .",
    "these local variations are probably due to non - uniformities in the grain properties , which affect the equilibrium temperature and the grain emissivity ( see eq.9 ) . therefore the color maps should only be considered as a temperature `` indicator '' .",

    "the optical properties of amorphous carbon grains measured in laboratory by different experiments are not exactly the same and were characterized by models 1 , 2 and 3 , according to the authors who have performed the measurements .",
    "the temperature depends on the _ ratio _ between the grain absorption efficiency @xmath47 at two ( nearby ) wavelengths ( see eq .",

    "this is not the case for the grain density , which depends directly on @xmath47 ( eq .",

    "densities derived from model 1 are always larger than those derived from models 2 and 3 , if small grains ( @xmath125 m ) are considered . for larger grains",
    "( @xmath122 m ) the differences are not significant .",
    "our calculations are based on the hypothesis that the dust envelope is optically thin at wavelengths around 10@xmath0 m .",
    "the consistency of this assumption was verified _ a posteriori _ , since optical depths are indeed less than one and the computed spectrum in the interval 8 - 12@xmath0 m is consistent with iras - lrs data , in the cases of v  hya and irc+10216 .",
    "the estimated mass - loss rate for vhya is compatible with that derived by kahane et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , if grain dimensions of about 0.2@xmath0 m are adopted and one uses the optical models 1 or 2 .",
    "model 3 , with the same grain size , leads to a mass - loss rate a factor of three smaller .",
