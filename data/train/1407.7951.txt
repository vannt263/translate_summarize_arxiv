    "i would like to thank benot and paolo for their very competent supervision of this master thesis .",
    "river landscapes exhibit many different forms in all climatic regions of the world . nevertheless , one is also able to observe common features which often can be found to be the product of specific water and sediment interaction (",
    "see for example @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the science studying the coupled water and sediment dynamics to explain formation and alteration of river courses is called river morphodynamics and includes research on mainly longitudinal structures like long sediment waves and more complex 2-dimensional structures , among them are alternate and multiple bars ( see figure [ fig : bars ] ) . in the past , these research areas have been investigated using experimental setups ( see @xcite for bar experiments for example ) , numerical simulations ( see @xcite for example ) and theoretical approaches based on linear stability analysis ( @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "linear stability analysis is a concept that allows to study the asymptotic fate ( @xmath0 ) of a linear or linearized system which is slightly perturbated away from a spatially homogeneous solution .",
    "the method was originally developed by @xcite and has been applied frequently to hydrodynamic topics since .",
    "for example , @xcite used linear stability analysis to show that the capacity of a river to develop alternate or multiple bars is closely linked to its aspect ratio ( river width divided by depth ) .",
    "this benchmark result is depicted in figure [ fig : cst ] and we will reproduce it later in the present work . + it is well - known though that in addition to water and sediment transport , riparian vegetation can play a crucial role in river pattern development ( see @xcite ) . in particular , it is recognized that riparian vegetation affects river morphology through modification of the flow field , bank strength and erosion / sedimentation processes in the riverbed / floodplain ( @xcite ) . however , due to the very complex nature of the dynamic interactions between vegetation and sediment transport and flow , riparian vegetation evolution was often not taken into account explicitly .",
    "instead , it was added as a correcting factor for bed roughness and bank stability ( @xcite ) . while the treatment of vegetation as a correction factor may be justified when",
    "looking at short timescales where riparian vegetation density does not change much , this is not the case for river pattern formation which occurs over much longer timescales and where vegetation takes an active role in the process .",
    "for instance , dynamic interaction between riparian vegetation and flow and sediment is thought to be crucial in the formation of anabranching river patterns on vegetated bars and in ephemeral rivers in dry regions ( figure [ fig : anabranch ] a and b ) .",
    "additionally , we can find similar patterns on the inside of a meandering bend in large streams ( scroll bars , figure [ fig : anabranch ] c ) .",
    "+ recently , researchers have added riparian vegetation dynamics to numerical morphodynamic models and included some of the feedback mechanisms that are thought to occur in nature .",
    "namely , @xcite took into account vegetation induced impedance to sediment transport and increase in bank stability and @xcite modeled the interaction of bank stabilizing vegetation and a meandering riverbed .",
    "furthermore , @xcite proposed an analytical morphodynamic model coupled with an equation for riverbed vegetation dynamics .",
    "but , until today vegetation dynamics was never included in a stability analysis of morphodynamic equations .",
    "in fact , several difficulties arise when trying to formulate a physical vegetation model suitable for stability analysis .",
    "for example , in modeling the sediment stabilizing effect of plant root systems is often taken into account as a threshold in the sediment transport function below which no erosion occurs .",
    "however , such a threshold possesses mathematical properties that are not suitable for a stability analysis .",
    "+     is the river s aspect ratio and @xmath1 is the dimensionless longitudinal wavenumber which characterizes the spatial periodicity of the bars , width=340 ]    in the present work , we propose a minimal model for the evolution of riverbed vegetation density which takes into account only very basic mechanisms and is thus suitable for a stability analysis . using this vegetation model and a standard morphodynamic framework ,",
    "we would like to explore the possibility of such a coupled morphodynamic - vegetation system ( ecomorphodynamic equations ) to explain the formation of anabranching patterns .",
    "we would like to know which are the determining variables and to what extent the ecomorphodynamic analysis differs from the state of the art river morphodynamics .",
    "hence , we perform an analytical linear stability analysis on the linearized set of ecomorphodynamic equations which describe a model river whose riverbed is colonized by plants .",
    "this river is assumed to be of constant width with inerodible banks , the riverbed consists of cohesionless , erodible material ( sand / gravel ) of uniform size and the river s sediment transport capacity is thought to always exceed the threshold above which sediment transport occurs .",
    "additionally we assume sediment transport to be mainly bedload .",
    "+ we begin by formulating an equation which describes the evolution of riverbed vegetation density ( section [ sec : veg ] ) and discuss the different terms and its validity .",
    "important mechanisms to be considered are vegetation growth , distribution by means of seeding and resprouting , and death through flow impact induced uprooting .",
    "this equation is then coupled with a standard 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional river morphodynamic framework ( sections [ sec:1d_gov ] and [ sec:2d_gov ] respectively ) which consists of depth - averaged fluid and sediment continuity as well as a formulation for momentum balance in the fluid .",
    "these systems are subsequently linearized and perturbated around a spatially homogeneous solution and the conditions for which the wavelike perturbations amplify are investigated using linear stability analysis .",
    "this is done for a 1d - framework to study instability towards long sediment waves in section [ sec:1d ] and for a 2d - framework to study the formation of alternate and multiple bars .",
    "the main focus in this work is on highlighting the fundamental role that vegetation dynamics can have in this process together with known mechanisms of sediment dynamics .",
    "stability analysis of morphodynamic equations generally does not include the active role of vegetation explicitly due to the complex nature of the interaction mechanisms .",
    "hereafter , we develop an analytic model for riverbed vegetation dynamics and discuss its validity for different conditions . for simplicity ,",
    "we model vegetation as rigid , non - submerged cylinders with constant radius and submerged height equal to water depth .",
    "we then call @xmath2 the vegetation density defined as number of plants per unit area of riverbed and we model its growth by the logistic term @xmath3 with carrying capacity @xmath4 and specific vegetation growth rate @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , we assume that vegetation growth is stimulated by nearby existing vegetation by means of seeding and resprouting ( i.e. positive local feedback ) and we model it using the diffusion term @xmath6 with @xmath7 the streamwise vegetation diffusion constant and @xmath8 the streamwise coordinate .",
    "we finally want to quantify vegetation death caused by flow drag for which we only consider the direct uprooting effect of flow drag on non - submerged and rigid vegetation ( type i mechanism after @xcite ) . in this case , a fluid parcel which impacts on the vegetation is decelerated from mean stream velocity to zero .",
    "furthermore , the rate of fluid that impacts on the vegetation is also proportional to stream velocity while the vegetation cross - section per cubic meter of river is proportional to water depth and vegetation density .",
    "we therefore propose the vegetation uprooting term ( see also @xcite ) @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a proportionality constant , @xmath11 the water depth and @xmath12 the streamwise velocity .",
    "putting together equations ( [ eq : veg1 ] ) to ( [ eq : veg3 ] ) we get the rate of change of vegetation density as @xmath13    however , in real rivers flow is not constant throughout the year .",
    "typically , large parts of a river s cross - section are only flooded during a limited amount of time per year which allows vegetation to colonize these surfaces during non - flooded periods",
    ". therefore , equation ( [ eq : veg_const ] ) , except for certain special cases ( see figure [ fig : veg_paolo ] , where vegetation seems to grow while being completely submerged most of the time ) , is not really applicable for vegetation growth in natural streams since it considers all processes to happen simultaneously . in reality",
    "however , vegetation grows and seeds during the vegetation period ( which is part of the non - flooded period ) and is uprooted during the flooding period . to simplify our analysis , we assume constant and continuous flow and thus we have to integrate growth and seeding into the flooding period . in the following , we call @xmath14 the drought period without vegetation growth , @xmath15 the vegetation period and @xmath16 the duration of the flooding ( see figure [ fig : timescales ] for illustration where",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath14 have been separated for simplicity ) .",
    "the duration of a complete cycle ( for example a year or half a year depending on the specific conditions ) is then given by @xmath17 .",
    "if we assume that vegetation density does not vary much during a complete cycle i.e. @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the value of @xmath2 at the end of cycle i , then we can approximate the difference @xmath20 by the continuous time derivative @xmath21 .",
    "we write the change of @xmath2 after one cycle as @xmath22\\frac{\\tilde{t}_v}{\\tilde{t}_d+\\tilde{t}_v+\\tilde{t}_f}-\\tilde{\\alpha}_d\\tilde{y}\\tilde{u}^2\\tilde{\\phi}_i\\frac{\\tilde{t}_f}{\\tilde{t}_d+\\tilde{t}_v+\\tilde{t}_f}.\\ ] ] by approximating the finite differences by derivatives we get @xmath23\\frac{\\tilde{t}_v}{\\tilde{t}_d+\\tilde{t}_v+\\tilde{t}_f}-\\tilde{\\alpha}_d\\tilde{y}\\tilde{u}^2\\tilde{\\phi } \\frac{\\tilde{t}_f}{\\tilde{t}_d+\\tilde{t}_v+\\tilde{t}_f}\\ ] ] and since we assumed @xmath14,@xmath15 and @xmath16 to be constant , we can integrate them into the proportionality constants to end up with @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "we can see that merging together the different mechanisms results in a relative increase of the growth and diffusion constant with respect to the uprooting constant if @xmath28 .",
    "so even if in general the vegetation uprooting coefficient is much higher than the growth coefficient , this can be compensated by the small timescale ratio @xmath29 to get a regime where mutual feedback is possible .",
    "this is the case for example in the marshall river ( see hydrograph in figure [ fig : hydrograph ] ) and also for bar flooding in the thur river ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the differential equation ( [ eq : veg_fin ] ) may also be valid in the case of non - constant flow if the modeling assumptions are met .",
    "+ we quickly want to discuss two of the most important modeling assumptions adopted above , namely :    * vegetation density change during a cycle is small compared to its actual value * the only uprooting effect is due to direct flow drag on non - submerged rigid vegetation    the first assumption can be assumed to be valid if one considers the case of well developed vegetation . the vegetation coverage is dense enough to not allow much more biomass to be produced and at the same time a large part of the vegetation is robust enough to outlive the flooding period .",
    "the second point refers to the fact that we only consider direct flow drag ( thus neglecting erosion which exposes the root system ) .",
    "additionally , we need rigid vegetation like small trees or bushes with mean vegetation height @xmath30 greater than water depth @xmath11 in order for our assumption to be valid . for non - rigid vegetation , the exponent of @xmath12 in the uprooting term ( equation [ eq : veg3 ] ) should be somewhere between 1 and 2 while in the case of completely submerged vegetation the surface impacted by flow drag would be reduced by a factor of @xmath31 and thus , @xmath11 would be replaced by @xmath30 in equation ( [ eq : veg3 ] ) .",
    "in this section we perform a linear stability analysis of the 1-dimensional ecomorphodynamic equations . the 1d - framework is valid in case flow , bed and vegetation can be assumed to be homogeneous in the direction transverse to the flow .",
    "after the derivation of the dimensionless governing equations , linear stability is assessed .",
    "we first reproduce some well - known results ( @xcite and @xcite ) and then we go on to evaluate the effect that riverbed vegetation dynamics has on these results .",
    "figure [ fig : saintvenant ] depicts the model scheme adopted with the streamwise coordinate @xmath8 , the lateral ( normal ) coordinate @xmath32 ( not used in the 1d - analysis ) and the vertical coordinate @xmath33 .",
    "the riverbed of constant width is assumed to consist of sandy , non - cohesive material which causes friction and may be transported by the fully turbulent flow .",
    "furthermore , we consider the case of a straight channel ( see for example @xcite for curved channels ) with non - erodible banks .",
    "additionally , vegetation as described in section [ sec : veg ] is able to colonize the whole riverbed .",
    "then , assuming hydrostatic pressure distribution and the river width to be considerably larger than the flow depth , flow velocity may be depth - averaged and thus we get the well - known 1-dimensional de saint - venant momentum conservation law @xmath34+\\frac{\\tilde{\\tau}}{\\tilde{y}}=0.\\ ] ] where the first and second term are the local and convective acceleration respectively , the third term represents hydrostatic pressure distribution , term 4 is the streamwise slope of the river and term 5 is the bed friction term . recall that @xmath12 is the streamwise velocity and @xmath11 is the water depth , while @xmath35 is the bed elevation .",
    "we have to keep in mind that we are talking about long waves throughout our analysis ( pattern wavelength is larger than channel width ) in order for the depth - average as well as the 1d - formulation to make sense . as a closure relationship for bed friction @xmath36",
    ", we choose the simple chezy equation and write @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the overall chezy coefficient .",
    "the overall chezy coefficient depends on both , the bed roughness and the roughness induced by vegetation . according to @xcite ,",
    "it can be expressed for non - submerged and rigid vegetation as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the bed roughness which can be calculated by fixing manning coefficient @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the stokes drag coefficient and @xmath43 is the vegetation diameter .",
    "+ subsequently , flow continuity is formulated as @xmath44 thus neglecting flow diversion by vegetation and assuming that sediment density in the water is low , therefore omitting the sediment term .",
    "note that the flow diversion effect could easily be added but is left out here to keep the analysis simple . in order to account for sediment continuity",
    ", we then write the well - known 1d - exner equation , valid for non - cohesive sediment with uniform grain size as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is bed porosity and @xmath47 is sediment flux per unit width .",
    "we assume well - developed sediment transport ( always above the critical threshold ) , mainly in the form of bed load transport and therefore , as was done by @xcite , we adopt @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a parameter .",
    "this is an approximation of the original meyer - peter / m@xmath50ller formula which states @xmath51 with @xmath52 the dimensionless shear stress and @xmath53 the critical dimensionless shear stress . omitting the threshold @xmath53 ( assuming sediment transport to be always above the threshold ) and knowing that @xmath52 is proportional to @xmath54 we get back our simplified power law . +",
    "finally , we model riverbed vegetation dynamics using @xmath55 as explained in section [ sec : veg ] . equations ( [ hans11 ] ) and equation ( [ hans13 ] )",
    "are conventionally called the de saint - venant s ( sv ) equations . if sediment dynamics is added , we speak of de saint - venant - exner equations ( sve ) or morphodynamic equations . since we added vegetation dynamics to sve , we name it the de saint - venant - exner - vegetation equations ( svev ) or the ecomorphodynamic equations .      to perform a linear stability analysis , it is convenient to work with dimensionless quantities",
    ". therefore , to write equations ( [ hans11 ] ) and ( [ hans13 ] ) to ( [ hans15 ] ) in dimensionless form , we introduce the change of variables ( motivated by the approach of @xcite )    [ eq:1d_cha ] @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the normal water depth and @xmath58 is the velocity at normal water depth . using change of variables ( [ eq:1d_cha ] ) , we obtain ( arranged in a way to have the time derivative on the left - hand side )    [ eq:1d_dim ] @xmath59-c_b\\frac{u^2}{y}-c_v\\phi u^2\\\\ \\frac{\\partial{y}}{\\partial{t}}&=-y\\frac{\\partial{u}}{\\partial{s}}-u\\frac{\\partial{y}}{\\partial{s}}\\\\ \\frac{\\partial{\\eta}}{\\partial{t}}&=-\\gamma u^2\\frac{\\partial{u}}{\\partial{s}}\\\\ \\frac{\\partial{\\phi}}{\\partial{t}}&=\\nu_g \\phi(1-\\phi)+\\nu_d\\frac{\\partial{^2\\phi}}{\\partial{s^2}}-\\nu_d\\phi yu^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .      a linear stability analysis consists of studying the behavior of a linearized system when slightly perturbated away from a spatially homogeneous solution ( see @xcite ) . in the case of river morphology ,",
    "a common choice for a homogeneous solution consists of a river with flat bed and constant slope under constant , uniform flow conditions ( see section [ sec : veg ] for the generalization to non - constant flow ) .",
    "then , the reaction of the linearized system to small perturbations on every state variable is investigated whose physical meaning may be a variation in sediment supply or channel width for example ( @xcite . regardless of its shape , such a local perturbation can readily be interpreted as a wave packet and thus a velocity perturbation wave packet @xmath67 can be written as a fourier series with continuous wavenumber k @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the perturbation amplitude and @xmath70 the velocity perturbation . in a linear system , each sinusoidal component of the perturbation wave packet can then be treated separately to evaluate if there is growth towards periodic spatial patterns of the riverbed . in the following ,",
    "we first derive the homogeneous solution of ( [ eq:1d_dim ] ) and then linearize and perturbate the equations around the homogeneous solution .",
    "we begin with looking for spatially homogeneous solutions @xmath71 using normal flow conditions .",
    "so , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( where @xmath75 is the slope at normal flow conditions ) . using the dimensionless governing equations",
    ", we can find @xmath75 and @xmath76 as    [ eq:1d_hom ] @xmath77\\\\ \\phi_0=&\\frac{\\nu_g-\\nu_d}{\\nu_g}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that the equations also allow a trivial solution with @xmath78 which corresponds to a riverbed without vegetation .",
    "this solution becomes the only physically relevant solution in case @xmath79 .",
    "since the aim of this work is to evaluate the influence of vegetation on river patterns , the solution with @xmath78 is not interesting .",
    "the non - zero dimensionless homogeneous solution can finally be summarized as @xmath80 with @xmath75 and @xmath76 as defined in ( [ eq:1d_hom ] ) .",
    "the linearization is done by introducing into the dimensionless equations ( [ eq:1d_dim ] ) the perturbated homogeneous solution @xmath81 with @xmath69 the perturbation parameter and @xmath82 the perturbation ansatz . as we want to look for regular spatial patterns , we choose the perturbation ansatz as @xmath83 with @xmath84 the real dimensionless perturbation wavenumber and @xmath85 the perturbation vector .",
    "while we are used to deal with sinusoidal patterns of velocity , water depth and bed elevation this is less common for vegetation density .",
    "figure [ fig : phi0 ] depicts sinusoidal vegetation density patterns around a mean vegetation density of @xmath76 .",
    "we can see that this formulation only is valid if @xmath76 is larger than the vegetation perturbation amplitude .",
    "in fact , if this is not the case we get locally negative values for vegetation density which does not make sense physically .",
    "so we have to bear in mind that vegetation needs to be well - developed in order for our analysis to be valid .",
    "+ the cosine of equation [ eq:1d_ansatz ] can then be written as @xmath86 it can easily be seen that we get a complex conjugated system of equations when inserting the perturbation ansatz into ( [ eq:1d_dim ] ) .",
    "thus , one can write the perturbated homogeneous solution as @xmath87 where c.c . denotes the complex conjugate .",
    "note that the perturbation term of ( [ eq:1d_perhom ] ) for a given wavenumber @xmath84 is nothing else than one component of the wave packet introduced in ( [ eq : wavepacket ] ) .",
    "then by only keeping the @xmath88 terms we get    [ eq:1d_perteq ] @xmath89    the system of equations ( [ eq:1d_perteq ] ) can then be written as @xmath90 where a is the following 4 x 4 matrix : @xmath91 equations ( [ eq:1d_system ] ) and operator ( [ eq:1d_matrix ] ) define a system of ordinary , homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients which describes the initial ( linear ) temporal evolution of the initially perturbated system . to find general solutions of this system , we have to introduce the concept of a normal operator : an operator is normal if @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the complex conjugate transpose of @xmath94 .",
    "if @xmath94 was a normal operator , the matrix eigenfunctions would form an orthogonal basis and we could write the general solution as @xmath95 where i is the rank of the matrix ( 4 in this case ) , @xmath96 are coefficients and @xmath97 are the complex eigenvalues of @xmath94 . in the limit of large t , this solution is dominated by the exponential with the largest temporal growth rate ( maximum of the real parts of @xmath97 ) and thus the solution decays to zero if the maximum growth rate is below zero and it diverges for a positive maximum growth rate .",
    "however , in the context of river morphology a is not a normal operator and therefore its eigenfunctions do not form an orthogonal basis .",
    "that is , transient growth occurs ( @xcite ) and ( [ eq:1d_solution ] ) is not generally valid anymore .",
    "however , asymptotically the exponential with the largest real part of the eigenvalues is still going to dominate and thus describes the behavior of the system . as in this work",
    "we are only interested in the long - term behavior of perturbations , we thus can still state that the initially small perturbations will be amplified in the long - term linear regime if the real part of any @xmath97 is positive . and if the largest growth rate occurs for a finite wavenumber @xmath84 , this mode would be amplified stronger than all other modes contained in the wave packet and thus would dominate after some time due to the exponential character of the growth rate .",
    "thus , we can retain the following important points :    * the system is stable ( perturbation is not amplified ) with respect to a perturbation mode with wavenumber @xmath84 if @xmath98 * the system is unstable ( perturbation is amplified ) with respect to a perturbation mode with wavenumber @xmath84 if @xmath99 * the system is unstable towards regular spatial patterns if the highest growth rate @xmath100 occurs at finite wavenumber @xmath84    additionally , the phase velocity of a perturbation can be computed using the imaginary part of the eigenvalues as @xmath101 which gives information about the propagation of the perturbation : if @xmath102 then the perturbation propagates downstream and conversely if @xmath103 the perturbation propagates upstream .      in this section ,",
    "the results of the stability analysis of matrix a , which was derived in section [ sec:1d_lin ] , are presented and interpreted .",
    "the eigenvalues are calculated numerically and plotted by mathematica for different parameter values while the pattern images are computed using matlab .",
    "additionally , in the simplest case of no vegetation and no sediment transport , the instability condition can be calculated analytically .",
    "the aim of the analysis is to find parameter regions where the fastest growing initial perturbation has a finite wavenumber and thus the system can evolve to a regular pattern upon perturbation . in the following two subsections ,",
    "we first repeat the calculations done by lanzoni et al .",
    ", 2006 for the cases of hydrodynamic equations ( sv ) and hydrodynamic equations coupled with sediment dynamics ( sve ) .",
    "then in [ sec:1d_sta_svv ] and [ sec:1d_sta_svev ] , we analyze the hydrodynamic equations coupled with vegetation dynamics ( svv ) and finally the hydrodynamic equations coupled with sediment and vegetation dynamics ( svev ) .",

    "figure [ fig_sv1 ] shows the temporal growth rate for different values of @xmath116 .",
    "for @xmath107 the growth rate is zero . if @xmath108 however , the growth rate increases asymptotically with increasing @xmath84 while for @xmath117 it is always negative.this means that perturbations are amplified only if @xmath118 and that the most unstable mode is the one where the wavenumber @xmath84 tends to infinity and so the wavelength is equal to zero . according to @xcite this instability is linked to the formation of roll waves .",
    "but , in the linear regime no instability towards regular patterns with finite wavelength is possible in a river with fixed bed and without riverbed vegetation .",
    "+ additionally , figure [ fig_sv2 ] shows that perturbations propagate downstream only if the flow is subcritical and in both directions if flow is supercritical .",
    "if sediment dynamics is added to the de saint - venant equations ( which means that the bed material may be transported by the flow ) , the eigenvalues of a 3 x 3 matrix have to be computed ( upper left part of a ) .",
    "it turns out that if the morphodynamic timescale is small compared to the hydrodynamic timescale which is normally the case ( @xmath119 , see @xcite for some values ) , the first two ( hydrodynamic ) modes are essentially the same as in the previous paragraph .",

    "+ the growth rate of the morphodynamic mode is below zero ( equal to zero at k=0 ) for all values of @xmath116 and @xmath84 which means that the morphodynamic mode is ( as were the hydrodynamic modes ) not able to produce instability towards finite patterns . finally , as we can see from figure [ fig_sve4 ]",
    "the migration of the perturbations is downstream if the flow is subcritical and upstream if the flow is supercritical .",
    "all results of paragraphs [ sec:1d_sta_sv ] and [ sec:1d_sta_sve ] are in agreement with the findings of @xcite which confirms the correctness of the stability analysis performed .",

    "figure [ fig:2d_sve3 ] depicts parameter domains where alternate bar and multiple bar regimes respectively dominate ( based on the highestl growth rate ) .",
    "the aspect ratio @xmath123 seems to be the decisive parameter in a reasonable range of froude numbers between 1 and 2 .",
    "however , the froude number for flooding in the marshall river is between 0.3 and 0.4 according to @xcite and thus @xmath125 is also important to determine the bar regime of a river .",
    "and , once the froude number exceeds a certain maximum value , instability towards bar formation does no longer exist .",
    "overall , we can say that results of earlier stability analyses of bar instability could be reproduced in this work .",

    "the froude number does has a crucial role at low f and no patterns exist above roughly @xmath107 . when analyzing the 2d - de saint - venant equation combined with vegetation dynamics , we find , similarly to the 1-dimensional model , that there exists a domain where vegetation growth and mortality by means of uprooting compete and thus instability towards finite patterns prevails .",
    "however , a minimum value for the aspect ratio is required to induce such instability and only instability towards alternate bars occurs ( the exponential growth rate of alternate bars in the linear regime always exceeds the growth rate of multiple bars of any order ) .",
    "the froude number , which is directly proportional to stream velocity , is very important to balance vegetation dynamics since a higher velocity increases the river s uprooting capacity ( see equation ( [ eq : veg3 ] ) ) .",
    "+ when analyzing the full model including sediment as well as vegetation dynamics , a pattern domain of essentially two parts is detected .",
    "one part occurs at low froude numbers and high dimensionless vegetation density ( independently of actual vegetation carrying capacity ) and mainly possesses features of sediment transport induced instability : independence of froude number , multiple bar order increases with increasing aspect ratio and higher dimensionless wavenumber for higher aspect ratios .",

    "the vegetation model was kept very simple in order to be suitable for a stability analysis and it included terms for vegetation growth , diffusion through seeding / resprouting and mortality by means of uprooting caused by flow shear . at first , this equation was developed for rivers with constant flow , but was shown to also apply ( under certain conditions ) to variable flow and even ephemeral rivers .",
    "+ our analysis of the 1d model showed that vegetated rivers indeed exhibit instability towards longitudinal sediment waves due to the competitive interaction between vegetation growth and mortality .",
    "then , instability towards river patterns with lateral structure ( bars ) was assessed using the 2d ecomorphodynamic equations and it was discovered that two different kinds of instabilities occur .",

    "only instability towards alternate bars was detected , independently of the aspect ratio .",
    "+ we also looked at the value of the most unstable longitudinal pattern wavenumber .",
    "generally , it was found that the values identified were reasonable ( corresponding wavelength has the same order of magnitude than river width ) although sometimes at the higher limit of what is allowed by the model assumptions .",
    "however , we were not able to identify instability towards longitudinally infinite multiple channels as it occurs in some reaches of the marshall river ( figure [ fig : anabranch ] b ) .",
    "actually , the longitudinal wavenumbers found for multiple bar instability at low froude numbers were too high to form such channels .",
    "other parameter configurations or more detailed modeling would probably be required to match reality in this case .",
    "+ in general , experimental verification of the equation adopted and research on the parameter values would be needed to adjust our purely theoretical model to reality .",
    "in addition , flume experiments could also help to quantify other aspects of vegetation and sediment transport interaction that we did not take into account .",
    "for instance , we only model the effect of vegetation on sediment transport indirectly by increasing the river s bed roughness . yet , other processes like scouring that increases sediment ablation around plants ( see @xcite for a scouring model around bridge piers ) and riverbed stabilization by plant s root systems are probably important as well but too difficult to model analytically at this stage .",
    "further improvement of the vegetation model could include finding expressions for vegetation uprooting by gradual exposure of plants root system ( type ii mechanism of @xcite ) and flow diversion produced mainly by rigid vegetation .",
    "+ finally , since we were dealing with a non - normal operator in our stability analysis , transient growth of the system can occur which was not considered in the present work .",
    "therefore , as was done by @xcite for the morphodynamic equations , a non - modal analysis of our linear ecomorphodynamic operator is conceivable in the future to evaluate the importance of such transient growths .",
    "the reason is that sometimes this transient behavior can actually be more relevant in reality than the asymptotic fate depending on the timescale of interest .",
    "moreover , in addition to performing a stability analysis which only takes into account growth or decay at the linear level , we could extend our research by adding a non - linear numerical simulation of the initial perturbations .",
    "in fact , as the perturbations amplify non - linearities of the system may become important and eventually dominate , thus determining the asymptotic fate of the system . in any case , all these possibilities of improvement of current modeling of interaction of riparian vegetation and river morphology show that we are still barely scratching the surface of this complex subject .",

    "<S> although riparian vegetation is present in or along many water courses of the world , its active role resulting from the interaction with flow and sediment processes has only recently become an active field of research . </S>",
    "<S> especially , the role of vegetation in the process of river pattern formation has been explored and demonstrated mostly experimentally and numerically until now . in the present work </S>",
    "<S> , we shed light on this subject by performing a linear stability analysis on a simple model for riverbed vegetation dynamics coupled with the set of classical river morphodynamic equations . </S>",
    "<S> the vegetation model only accounts for logistic growth , local positive feedback through seeding and resprouting , and mortality by means of uprooting through flow shear stress . due to the simplicity of the model </S>",
    "<S> , we can transform the set of equations into an eigenvalue problem and assess the stability of the linearized equations when slightly perturbated away from a spatially homogeneous solution . </S>",
    "<S> if we couple vegetation dynamics with a 1d morphodynamic framework , we observe that instability towards long sediment waves is possible due to competitive interaction between vegetation growth and mortality . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the domain in the parameter space where perturbations are amplified was found to be simply connected . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , we proceed to the analysis of vegetation dynamics coupled with a 2d morphodynamic framework , which can be used to evaluate instability towards alternate and multiple bars . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that two kinds of instabilities , which are discriminated mainly by the froude number , occur in a connected domain in the parameter space . at lower froude number , </S>",
    "<S> instability is mainly governed by sediment dynamics and leads to the formation of alternate and multiple bars while at higher froude number instability is driven by vegetation dynamics , which only allows for alternate bars . </S>"
