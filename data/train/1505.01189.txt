    "hence , by removing @xmath24 from @xmath5 the possible changes in @xmath65 are : ( i ) decreasing one or two elements of @xmath65 by @xmath67 : each vertex in @xmath354 ( of which there are at most two ) may lose one neighbor , ( ii ) removal of a single element from @xmath65 ( the element corresponding to @xmath24 itself , if @xmath355 ) .    to prove the lemma , we first strengthen lemma [ lem : compatiblebound ] , and replace the condition @xmath189 by @xmath356 .",

    "a proof of property ( 3 ) follows from property ( 2 ) by a simple variation of the proof of theorem [ thm : maintheorem ] .",
    "we now explain how to canonically label a graph @xmath15 with these three properties . to a vertex @xmath24 that is contained in a cycle we assign the @xmath406-smallest label @xmath415 over all cycles for which @xmath416 .",
    "this label can be found in polynomial time . if @xmath125 is the length of the shortest cycle through @xmath416 , then it is easy to show that there are at most @xmath417 such cycles .",
