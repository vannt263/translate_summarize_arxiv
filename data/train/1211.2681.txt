    "such a bound has numerous applications , of which we mention one : abramovich @xcite has combined it with a lower bound on the eigenvalue arising from the theory of automorphic forms ( of which the currently sharpest value was given by kim and sarnak @xcite ) to prove a lower bound on the gonality of modular curves for congruence groups that is linear in the genus of the curves ( or , what is the same , linear in the index of the group in the full modular group ) . in this paper , we study a nonarchimedean analogue of these results .",
    "the first result is an inequality between the ( geometric ) gonality @xmath9 of a curve @xmath5 defined over a complete nonarchimedean valued field @xmath0 and the `` gonality '' of the reduction graphs of suitable models of the curve .",

    "[ extension ] , we provide another ( similar ) solution , directly adapted to the applications that we have in mind .",
    "next , we relate the gonality of the special fiber to what we call the _ stable gonality _ of the intersection dual graph . for standard graph terminology",

    "we also need the notion of an ( indexed ) finite harmonic graph morphism , for which we refer to definition [ defmor ] . given a graph @xmath11 , then another graph @xmath12 is called a _ refinement _ of @xmath11 if it can be obtained from @xmath11 by finitely often performing the two following operations : ( a ) subdivision of an edge ; ( b ) addition of a _ leaf _ , i.e. , the addition of an extra vertex and an edge between this vertex and a vertex of the already existing graph .",
    "stable gonality _ of @xmath11 , denoted @xmath13 , is defined as the minimal degree of a finite harmonic morphism from any refinement of @xmath11 to a tree .",

    "hence these results also hold for the congruence number .",
    "we then give applications to rational points of bounded degree on general curves over function fields .",

    "in this appendix , we describe various other notions of graph gonality from the literature , and discuss the relation of stable gonality to these alternatives .",

    "a _ morphism _ between two loopless graphs @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( denoted by @xmath190 ) is a map @xmath191 such that @xmath192 , and for every edge @xmath193 , either @xmath194 or @xmath811 and @xmath812 ; together with , for every @xmath195 , a non - negative integer @xmath196 , the _ index _ of @xmath197 at @xmath198 , such that @xmath813 if and only if @xmath811 .    previously , in definition [ defmor ] , we only considered _ finite _ morphisms , which are morphisms that map edges to edges .",
    "the notions of harmonicity and degree that we introduced in definition [ defmor ] make sense for morphisms , even if they are not finite .",
    "a harmonic morphism is called _ non - degenerate _ if @xmath814 for every @xmath199 ( this is automatic if it is finite ) .",
    "it suffices to prove that any non - degenerate harmonic morphism @xmath817 from a graph @xmath11 to a tree @xmath209 admits a refinement @xmath281 that is a _",
    "finite _ harmonic morphism of the same degree as @xmath124 .",
    "thus , let @xmath818 denote an edge that is mapped to a vertex @xmath819 .",
    "add an extra leaf @xmath820 to @xmath209 at @xmath161 , subdivide @xmath198 into two edges @xmath821 and @xmath822 , and map both @xmath356 and @xmath823 to @xmath820 .",
    "set @xmath824 for @xmath344 .",
    "finally , add a leaf @xmath825 to all @xmath826 , map them all to @xmath820 , and set @xmath827      [ conn ] the gonality of a graph @xmath11 is bounded below by the edge - connectivity ( viz . , the number of edges that need to be removed from the graph in order to disconnect it ) : @xmath828 if @xmath11 is a simple graph ( i.e. , without multiple edges ) , unequal to a complete graph , then @xmath829    let @xmath830 denote a harmonic non - degenerate morphism .",
    "choose any edge @xmath319 .",
    "since removing @xmath198 from @xmath209 disconnects it , @xmath831 is a set of edges of @xmath11 whose removal disconnects @xmath11 .",
    "hence @xmath832 for a simple graph which is not complete , the bound @xmath833 is one of the inequalities of fiedler @xcite ( 4.1 & 4.2 ) .",
    "the `` trivial '' spectral bound in the above proposition is not very useful in practice , since it does not contain a `` volume '' term ( like the li  yau inequality ) .",
    "also , since every graph acquires edge connectivity two or one by refinements , the lower bound in the proposition trivializes under refinements ( which are required by the reduction theory of morphisms ) .    another notion of gonality of graphs @xmath11 and , more generally , of _ metric _ graphs @xmath1 was introduced by baker in @xcite , defined as the minimal degree @xmath105",
    "for which there is a @xmath834 on @xmath1 ( in analogy to the definition from algebraic geometry ) .",
    "following caporaso , we call this gonality of graphs _ divisorial gonality_. in @xcite , caporaso has proven a brill  noether upper bound for divisorial gonality . for a fixed unmetrized graph , there is in general no relation ( inequality either side ) between gonality and divisorial gonality , cf .  @xcite remark 2.7 ( or the graphs on lines 4 and 7 of table [ table ] ) .    since the reduction of a stable curve is naturally a metric graph ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , one should not ignore the metric in connection with gonality of curves .",

    "( @xcite , cor .",
    "_ the stable gonality of a graph is larger than or equal to its _ stable _ divisorial gonality ( i.e. , the minimum of the divisorial gonality of all refinements ) , but the inequality can be strict .",

    "the stable gonality can be smaller than the divisorial gonality ( without refinement ) , as one can see from the sixth line in table [ table ] ; but the next line of the table shows a refinement that lowers the divisorial gonality .    the banana graph @xmath20 has divisorial and stable gonality @xmath22 but edge connectivity @xmath23 ( cf .",
    "table [ table ] ) , showing that an equality analogous to the one in proposition [ conn ] can not hold for divisorial or stable gonality .",
    "dion gijswijt remarked that @xmath835 with josse van dobben de bruyn , he has also proven that the divisorial gonality of a graph is larger than or equal to its treewidth ( unpublished , but some preliminaries can be found in @xcite ) , but the entries in table [ table ] show that the inequality can be strict .",
    "lower bounds on treewidth imply such bounds on divisorial gonality ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it seems that our notion of stable gonality of a graph coincides with the notion of gonality introduced in @xcite from the viewpoint of tropical geometry .",
    "the connection between tropical curves and metric graphs can already be found in mikhalkin @xcite , and the notion of harmonic morphism of metric graphs in anand @xcite .",
