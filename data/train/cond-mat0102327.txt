    "_ phase transition _ plays a central role in equilibrium and non equilibrium statistical physics books and lectures in particular because it exemplifies the paradigmatic concept of universality in physics . in the theory of dynamical systems , the concept of _ lyapunov exponent",
    "_ has also attracted a lot of attention  @xcite because it defines unambiguously a sufficient condition for chaotic instability , but unfortunately except for very few systems it is already an extremely difficult task to derive analytically the expression of the largest one , @xmath0 , as a function of the energy density . as some promising results have been recently obtained to describe some properties of high - dimensional dynamical systems  @xcite , by combining tools developed in the framework of dynamical systems with concepts and methods of equilibrium statistical mechanics , the idea that both concepts could be related was proposed recently  @xcite .    during the last years",
    ", the process by which two strands of dna unbind upon heating , called dna denaturation or melting , has motivated a lot of works  @xcite and in particular an extremely simplified dynamical model  @xcite was proposed and studied .",
    "this one - dimensional hamiltonian has the following expression @xmath1 where @xmath2 corresponds to the effective mass of nucleotides , @xmath3 the coupling constant and @xmath4 ( resp .",
    "@xmath5 ) the depth ( resp .",
    "inverse length scale ) of the morse potential which mimic the interactions between groups of atoms of opposite strands .",
    "this potential with only nearest - neighbor interactions is well suited for using the transfer integral method in order to derive the canonical partition function .",
    "it can be shown  @xcite that this system can be mapped to the quantum mechanical analogy of a particle in a morse potential and that all thermodynamical quantities could finally be expressed as functions of the eigenvalues @xmath6 and eigenfunctions @xmath7 of this schrdinger problem .",
    "in particular , we showed the existence of a critical temperature @xmath8 corresponding to a second order phase transition between the so - called native ( or double strand ) state with the particles in the bottom of the morse well , and the denaturated state , with the particles on the morse plateau .",
    "the dynamical properties of this one - dimensional model are also very interesting and have , in particular , emphasized the role of localized oscillating excitations , called discrete breathers , as precursors effects driving this phase transition .",
    "spatiotemporal studies of the dynamics reveals also intermittency - like features and has led us to consider the importance of its chaotic properties as an important ingredient to characterize and to explain this dynamical instability .",
    "this is the reason why it is important to study the lyapunov behavior as a function of the energy density , not only by computing it numerically but also ( if possible ! ) by deriving its expression using the riemannian geometry approach proposed recently  @xcite .",
    "the main idea is that the chaotic hypothesis is at the origin of the validity of equilibrium statistical physics , and this should be traced somehow in the dynamics and therefore in the largest lyapunov exponent . through a reformulation of hamiltonian dynamics in the language of riemannian geometry  @xcite",
    ", the method proposes therefore to relate the microscopic dynamics to the statistical averages  @xcite . applied to a typical high - dimensional hamiltonian system",
    ", this corresponds to study the parametric - like instability of geodesics , driven by the fluctuations of the curvature .",
    "indeed , chaos can be induced not only by negative curvatures but also by positive ones , provided they are fluctuating , as it is less well known .",
    "once the curvature @xmath9 and its fluctuations @xmath10 are accurately determined , the method uses a gaussian stochastic process to approximate the effective curvature felt along a geodesic and finally one ends up with the following expression of the largest lyapunov exponent @xmath11 in this definition , @xmath12 , the relevant time scale associated to the stochastic process is function of the two following timescales : @xmath13 is the time needed to cover the distance between two successive conjugate points along the geodesics , whereas @xmath14 is related to the local curvature fluctuations .",
    "the general rough physical estimate @xmath15 completes finally the analytical estimate of @xmath0 that we would like to continue now by the calculation of the mean value of the curvature and its fluctuations as a function of the energy density .",
    "using the simplifying eisenhart metric , the ricci curvature @xmath16 corresponds to the laplacian of the potential energy . defining the function @xmath17",
    ", we get the following expression @xmath18 where we have used the equality of mean values in microcanonical @xmath19 and canonical @xmath20 ensembles  @xcite .",
    "the last expression is in particular derived using the expression of the groundstate @xmath21 of the quantum mechanical analogy since @xmath22 .",
    "figure  [ gyandgydeux ] attests that the agreement is excellent between the above analytical expression , the canonical transfer integral results and microcanonical molecular dynamics simulations , obtained using the best 4th order symplectic integrator due to maclahan - attela  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that , the mean curvature is always positive whereas the local one is negative close to the inflexion point of the morse potential . in addition , expression  ( [ curvature ] ) emphasizes the role of discreteness since the curvature would be almost constant in the continuum limit @xmath23 .",
    "this will have further consequences on the evolution of @xmath0 when the discreteness is changed .",
    "3.5truecm ( circles ) and @xmath10 ( squares ) as a function of the temperature @xmath24 .",
    "circles and squares correspond to microcanonical results , the solid lines to results obtained with the transfer integral method ; the dashed line to the analytical expression  ( [ curvature ] ) . finally , the dotted line correspond to the low temperature approximation  ( [ sigmapresde0 ] ) of the fluctuations of curvature .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    .",
    "since numerical computations are simpler in the microcanonical ensemble , while analytical calculations are simpler in the canonical one , to get the fluctuations of the curvature in the microcanonical ensemble , one needs to add the following corrective term  @xcite @xmath25 the expression of the energy @xmath26 emphasizes the second order of the phase transition , and finally using the expression of the mean value of the curvature , we obtain the microcanonical / canonical correction @xmath27 valid below @xmath28 .",
    "this quadratic correction vanishes for very low temperature and converges toward a negative constant close to @xmath28 .",
    "the expression of the fluctuations of curvature in the canonical ensemble is then @xmath29 the second part of the parenthesis could be easily computed and gives a term @xmath30 .",
    "the first one can be evaluated with the transfer integral method since , thanks to the periodic boundary condition , one needs to take into account only the difference in indices @xmath31 .",
    "however , one can not integrate directly the integral over the resulting @xmath32 variables , and one needs to decompose twice on the orthonormal basis @xmath33 of the transfer operator . defining the matrix elements of @xmath34 in this base @xmath35 we finally obtain @xmath36 as only the lowest eigenvalue @xmath37 will contribute in the thermodynamic limit , we finally get @xmath38 by recognizing a geometrical sum . figure  ( [ gyandgydeux ] ) emphasizes the excellent agreement between microcanonical simulations ( squares ) and the above analytical expression ( solid line ) where we have used the eigenfunctions of the transfer integral operator .",
    "the above expression  ( [ fluccourbure ] ) is however difficult to handle in general but could be simplified in the low temperature regime since the gap between the eigenvalue of the ground state @xmath39 and the other ones justify to neglect the exponential term in the denominator .",
    "this approximation breaks down of course close to the phase transition since the critical temperature is defined by the disappearance of the ground state @xmath39 in the continuum .",
    "we obtain thus @xmath40\\quad.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the procedure described for the calculation of @xmath41 , one obtains the formula @xmath42 , where the prefactors 2 and 4 have been renormalized to be in agreement with numerical simulations ; the discreteness of the chain , which drives the phase transition , is the main reason for this renormalization .",
    "adding finally the microcanonical correction  ( [ correcmicro ] ) , we obtain @xmath43 \\quad .",

    "( [ gyandgydeux ] ) attests the quality of this low temperature approximation which leads to a linear dependence versus temperature of the fluctuations @xmath44 at the lowest order .    in the neighborhood of the phase transition ,",
    "the last bound state is too close to the continuum : the exponential term in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ fluccourbure ] ) can not be neglected and one needs to take into account fully the interactions with the continuum . due to the rapid oscillations of the scattering eigenstates , one could use the approximate expression for the phase shift of the scattering states , as it was successfully shown in the calculation of the static structure factor and therefore for the susceptibility as its limit  @xcite .",
    "but , unfortunately for the present calculation , there is an important contribution of eigenstates with nonvanishing eigenvectors which prevents this high temperature approximation to succeed .",
    "once the curvature  ( [ curvature ] ) and its fluctuations  ( [ fluccourbure ] ) have been calculated , it is straightforward to compute the two timescale @xmath45 and @xmath46 . having in mind that the estimate of the decorrelation time scale @xmath12 is still somehow rudimentary  @xcite in the riemannian framework outlined above , fig .",
    "( [ lyapfinal ] ) shows that the alternative definition @xmath47 gives a particularly striking agreement between the microcanonical numerical results obtained using the standard algorithm  @xcite and the analytical derivation proposed here .",
    "let us emphasize that the agreement is excellent on the whole interval contrary to earlier results obtained for the @xmath48 chain  @xcite .",
    "the approach described here has a domain of validity even larger than expected since the agreement is very good even in the region where the fluctuations of curvature are of the order or greater than the curvature itself .",
    "it is also very interesting to remark that the simultaneous use of the riemannian geometry approach and the transfer integral method , that we propose here , could be easily extended to the treatment of any chain of oscillators with on - site potential and nearest - neighbor harmonic coupling .",
    "once the transfer integral operator is solved analytically as it is possible here for hamiltonian  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) or numerically in general , the evolution of the largest maximal lyapunov exponent as a function of the energy density is directly derived from expressions of the curvature  ( [ curvature ] ) and fluctuations  ( [ fluccourbure ] ) , by simply replacing @xmath49 by the second derivative of the onsite potential .    1truecm    a closer look at very low energy density , shows however a non surprising disagreement since the inset plotted in fig .",
    "( [ lyapfinal ] ) clearly violates the low energy density approximate law @xmath50 , which would give here a linearly increasing function of the temperature according to the lowest order estimate of @xmath10 .",
    "the reason is presumably the breakdown of the stochastic approximation for the average curvature in this very low energy limit where the system is almost quadratic and therefore the crucial ergodic hypothesis is not completely fullfilled any more .",
    "more interestingly , the numerical model emphasizes an unusual 3/2 power law contrary to the generally reported @xmath51 dependence of @xmath0 in high - dimensional dynamical systems  @xcite .",
    "let us note that the expression of @xmath52 is strongly dependent of the discreteness parameter @xmath53 , but the fluctuations @xmath10 are not . as fig .",
    "( [ lyapfinal ] ) shows that , away from the critical region , smaller the curvature is , greater the lyapunov is , one can expect that the more discrete the chain is , the more chaotic its dynamics would be .",
    "this result is clearly in qualitative agreement with the discovery that spontaneously created discrete breathers are actually _ chaotic _ excitations and that their domain of stability is far from the continuum limit  @xcite .",
    "this model is also a very interesting case where one can characterize @xmath0 as a dynamical indicator of a phase transition . in this case of a second order phase transition , one obtains a critical slowing down reminiscent of the results obtained for the heisenberg mean - field model derived by firpo  @xcite .",
    "we would like also to emphasize the singular behavior of @xmath52 , @xmath10 and @xmath0 at the critical energy density , in complete agreement with the exciting conjectures  @xcite linking them to a topology change in the underlying manifold , being itself an indicator of a thermodynamic phase transition .",
    "more interestingly , we also have studied hamiltonian  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) whith an anharmonic coupling potential @xmath54 \\   ( y_n - y_{n-1})^{2}$ ] which has the property to describe the varying backbone stiffness of the dna .",
    "this hamiltonian was shown to have a first order like phase transition  @xcite when the ratio of the two inverse length scales @xmath55 is lower than @xmath56 . if analytical estimate of the lyapunov exponent are not possible , fig .",
    "[ doublelyap ] shows its evolution obtained using microcanonical molecular dynamics simulations . in the low energy limit ,",
    "the additional parenthesis do not produce of course modifications , but it emphasizes an abrupt change  @xcite of the lyapunov exponent at the critical energy density as if @xmath0 was a dynamical order parameter indicating the _ first _ order phase transition .",
    "in this letter , we have presented one of the very few analytical calculation of the largest lyapunov exponent in a high - dimensional dynamical system  @xcite . as expected , in addition to serve as a criterion for chaos , or as a characteristic time scale of chaoticity",
    ", @xmath0 is an excellent dynamical indicator of the presence of the phase transition and could be used not only to describe the dynamics but also the statistical properties of high dimensional systems .",
    "it is also interesting to consider the behavior of another important dynamical indicator , the _ participation ratio _ of the normalized lyapunov vector @xmath57 associated to the maximal lyapunov @xmath0 .",
    "defined as @xmath58 ^ 2\\right)$ ] , where the first ( resp .",
    "last ) @xmath59 components are associated to the evolution of linear perturbations of @xmath60 ( resp .",
    "@xmath61 ) in tangent space , @xmath62 is an indicator of localization  @xcite : it is of order one if the vector is extended and of order @xmath63 if localized . here",
    ", we found that the phase transition corresponds to a crossover from a localized state in tangent space at low energy density to a more extended state just after the phase transition , confirming that the tangent space trough the largest lyapunov exponent @xmath0 , but also its associated eigenvector @xmath57 through the participation ratio @xmath62 , are surprisingly good dynamical indicators for emphasizing thermodynamical phase transitions .                                          results reported in  @xcite clearly shows the behavior of a first order phase transition with an unusual diverging correlation length .",
    "however , it is likely that the order of the transition would be second order in the critical region which is extremely thin and unreachable numerically .",
    "see , or unpublished ( 2000 )",
    ". however , as the width of this critical region could be decreased only by decreasing the ratio @xmath55 , this phase transition will considered as first - order like ."
