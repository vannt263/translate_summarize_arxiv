    "the binary system yy gem has been studied for many years since discovered @xcite .",
    "it is a double - lined spectroscopic eclipsing binary system which contains two dm1e late - type stars with masses and radii almost identical , and the orbital period being @xmath1 d ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is of great importance to study the basic relations of such rare late - type binaries ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "based on some considerations in @xcite , @xcite gave the parameters of yy gem : @xmath2 m@xmath3 , @xmath4 r@xmath3 , the separation of the two components @xmath5 r@xmath3 .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the depth of each stellar radiative core is @xmath6 70 per cent of its radius , and the thickness of the convective zone is @xmath6 30 per cent .",
    "strong convective motions under the surfaces cause large - scale star spots and huge magnetic field structures . flare activity on yy gem was reported for the first time by @xcite .",
    "subsequent investigations have shown that it is one of the most active flaring binaries ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "their flaring activities have been studied in multi - wavelengths . using the very large array ,",
    "@xcite presented radio observations ; @xcite studied the simultaneous x - ray spectroscopy of yy gem with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ satellites ; while , far uv observations of yy gem were reported by @xcite .",
    "the flarings on yy gem exhibit uv and x - ray emissions which are stronger than those on the sun @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite observed two large flares , and the integrated x - ray luminosity was estimated to be about 6 - 8 @xmath7 erg .",
    "they also calculated the ratio of x - ray and bolometric luminosities @xmath8 , which indicated strong magnetic activities and ` hot ' coronal components .    for close binaries with similar masses ,",
    "the density scale - height is quite large , i.e. , the density does not decrease with height from the stellar surfaces as rapidly as in the solar corona .",
    "therefore , the hot plasma between the two stars could emit strong x - ray light .",
    "for example , observations revealed large - scale strong x - ray sources between the two stars of the rs cvn binary ar lac ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , as well as of the rs cvn binary ty pyx ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . at the same time",
    ", it is probable that the two stars are magnetically connected , as illustrated by @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that the interstellar activities are intimately affected by the differential rotations of both stars .",
    "so , there may exist some interesting phenomena in such a system .",
    "one of them is the periodic flaring rate , which was reported by @xcite .",
    "their observation in the _ u_-band showed four flares separated in succession with a periodicity of @xmath9 min during a total observing time of 408 min .",
    "the duration of each flare varies from @xmath10 min to @xmath11 min , and the time - averaged flare luminosity in the _",
    "u_-band is 1.25 @xmath12 @xmath13 erg s@xmath14 .",
    "they interpreted this periodicity in terms of filament oscillations . in this paper , we attempt to propose an alternative explanation for the periodicity",
    ".    flares on the sun and dke - dme stars are both thought to result from magnetic reconnection . on the sun ,",
    "periodic behaviours have also been reported in various reconnection - associated phenomena , e.g. , the quasi - periodic modulation of flaring emission ( @xcite ) and the repetitive appearance of transition region explosive events ( @xcite ) . in the former case , magnetic reconnection is modulated by magnetoacoustic waves from a nearby oscillating coronal loop , whereas in the latter , magnetic reconnection is modulated by _ p_-mode waves .    to our knowledge , no efforts in mhd numerical simulations have been devoted to the investigation of flaring phenomenon in binary systems , although hydrodynamic simulations have been done regarding flares in m dwarf stars ( e.g. @xcite ) . using potential field extrapolation",
    ", @xcite demonstrated that the evolving surface magnetic field can result in magnetic reconnection in the interstellar space . here",
    ", we perform mhd numerical simulations in order to investigate the magnetic reconnection in a close binary system , with the purpose to clarify which process is likely to be responsible for the periodicity of the flaring rate as reported by @xcite . the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the basic model , mhd equations , initial and boundary conditions .",
    "section 3 gives the numerically calculated results .",
    "discussions are presented in section 4 , which is followed by conclusions in section 5 .",
    "the basic model used in our work is shown in fig .",
    "1 . for ordinary binaries ,",
    "the member stars are usually of different types . as usual , we call the one with larger mass the primary , marked as @xmath15 , the other the secondary , marked as @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) . owing to the difference in mass , the point of zero gravity and the centre of mass are located at different positions . the former is closer to the secondary ( @xmath16 ) and the latter is closer to the primary ( @xmath15 ) . in the case of yy gem , we take the parameters given by @xcite , i.e. , @xmath18 , so that the two points are actually cospatial . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , @xmath19 is the separation of two stellar centres , and @xmath20 r@xmath3 is the distance between the two surfaces along the joint line of the stars .    because of the short orbital period , @xcite and @xcite suggested that yy gem should be in synchronized rotation .",
    "therefore , we assume that the angular velocities of both stars have the same value as that of the co - rotating reference system .",
    "this means that the two stars rotate almost face to face except the differential rotation . as a result of the differential rotation , persistent shear motion",
    "is imposed to the coronal loops whose footpoints are rooted at different latitudes .",
    "the mhd processes driven by the differential rotation are three - dimensional in nature .",
    "the addition of the two spherical boundaries makes the problem more unfeasible to solve numerically . to simplify the problem without losing the essence of physics ,",
    "the spherical boundaries are treated as two parallel planes , which are tangent to the spheres at the equators as illustrated with the dotted lines in fig .",
    "the area of interest is @xmath21 and @xmath22 r@xmath23 r@xmath3 , where the @xmath24-axis is along the joint line of the binary , the @xmath25-axis is parallel to the axis of the rotation , and the @xmath26-axis is perpendicular to the @xmath27 plane , with the origin of the coordinate being located on the equator of @xmath15 star . note that the vertical size is set to be larger than the stellar radius in order to minimize the influence of the top boundary on the numerical results .",
    "moreover , all quantities are approximated to be invariant along the @xmath26-axis , so that the problem becomes 2.5-dimensional . in reality",
    ", the interface between the magnetic systems of the two stars has a limited extension in the @xmath26-direction .",

    "we perform 2.5-dimensional @xmath28 numerical simulations in the cartesian coordinates as described above .",

    "when @xmath118 increases , the magnetic field @xmath86 increases as well in order to keep @xmath85 constant ( correspondingly , the alfvn speed is constant ) . as a result , the period of the reconnection rate does not change.it is also seen from table [ tab1 ] that @xmath111 has little effect on the period , which implies that the magnetic reconnection is modulated by some external process .",

    "[ vxgray ] , where the waves are seen to travel back and forth in the @xmath24-direction , bounded by the surfaces of the two stars . since the waves propagate perpendicular to the magnetic field lines , we postulate that they are fast - mode magnetoacoustic waves , and that the periodic magnetic reconnection in the numerical results is modulated by such waves .     along the @xmath24-axis.,title=\"fig:\",width=302,height=226 ] +     +    to verify that the magnetic reconnection is modulated by magnetoacoustic waves bouncing back and forth between the two stellar surfaces , we shift the right boundary of case a2 leftward and the left boundary rightward by 0.8 simultaneously , by which the separation between the two stellar surfaces is cut down from 5.26 to 3.66 , i.e. , a decrease with a ratio of 30 per cent . the corresponding evolution of the reconnection rate is plotted in fig .",
    "[ d_cut ] .",
    "note that the positive @xmath113 means that the field lines in the two loop systems are reconnecting , whereas the negative @xmath113 means that the transverse field lines are reconnecting .",
    "it is found that the resulting period of magnetic reconnection becomes 34 @xmath136 6 min .",
    "this means that the period decreases by 37 per cent , a ratio close to that of the decrease of the separation between the two stellar surfaces .",
    "this implies that the magnetic reconnection is modulated by waves trapped between the two stellar surfaces .    to verify that the travelling waves are fast - mode waves , here we calculate the trajectory of fast - mode waves propagating from the reconnection point ( @xmath137 ) , through the right boundary ( @xmath138 ) and then back to the reconnection point along the @xmath24-axis . for a given number @xmath139 , the travelling time ( @xmath42 ) and the position of the wave front ( @xmath24 )",
    "are determined by the following equations    @xmath140    where @xmath141 is the uniform grid spacing in the @xmath24-direction , and @xmath142 is the fast - mode wave velocity .",
    "the procedure is described as follows : starting from the reconnection point ( @xmath24=2.63 ) , the wave front propagates rightward by @xmath143 each step , the time interval @xmath144 is equal to @xmath141 divided by @xmath142 , so the total travelling time is the sum of @xmath144 , while the position is the sum of @xmath141 .",
    "note that since both the magnetic field and the plasma temperature are changing with time , we update the magnetic and thermal parameters every 1 @xmath110 when calculating @xmath142 . besides , when the wave reaches the right boundary and then bounces back , @xmath141 takes a negative value .",
    "after the wave front returns to the reconnection point , the wave should propagate to the left half area of the simulation box .",

    "therefore , we are convinced that the magnetic reconnection is modulated by fast - mode waves .",
    "the underlying process can be understood as follows : when symmetric waves , introduced either by the shear motions of the stellar surfaces or by the magnetic reconnection , collide near the reconnection point , the reconnection rate is enhanced to form a peak .",
    "after the collision , the two waves propagate to the right and left boundaries and are bounced back , respectively .",

    "<S> the binary yy gem shows many interesting properties , one of which is the periodicity in its flaring rate . </S>",
    "<S> the period , which is about @xmath0 min , was ever interpreted in terms of the oscillation of a filament . in this paper , we propose a new model to explain this phenomenon by means of 2.5-dimensional mhd numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that magnetic reconnection is induced as the coronal loops rooted on both stars inflate and approach each other , which is driven by the differential stellar rotation . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic reconnection is modulated by fast - mode magnetoacoustic waves which are trapped between the surfaces of the two stars , so that the reconnection rate presents a periodic behaviour . with the typical parameters for the binary system , </S>",
    "<S> the observed period can be reproduced . </S>",
    "<S> we also derive an empirical formula to relate the period of the flaring rate to the coronal temperature and density , as well as the magnetic field .    </S>",
