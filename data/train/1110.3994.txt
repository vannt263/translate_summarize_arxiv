    "the description of @xmath6 is again excellent , but now the nearest - neighbor radial distribution is also well fitted .",

    "inspired by this fact , we explore the possibility to use our npv model to study the formation of second - level administrative divisions ( slads ) , such as counties in the usa or ( non - urban ) districts ( _ arrondissements _ ) in france .",
    "the formation of slads depends on many political , cultural , ecological , and geographical factors @xcite .",
    "these factors are in general difficult to include in a mathematical model",

    "[ slad1 ] . increasing the value of @xmath119",
    "improves the estimation of @xmath201 and @xmath202 but it leads to a poor description of @xmath6 .",

    "we attribute this discrepancy to the assumption of point islands .",
    "one must account for the actual areas of cities , which produces an effective short - range repulsion .",
    "the simplest way to incorporate this feature into our model is to introduce an excluded area around each city center in the form of a hard - core radius @xmath203 .",
    "in particular , we modify eqs .",

    "[ slad ] and [ slad1 ] ) .",
    "this improved model still describes adequately @xmath6 , but now the fits involving @xmath181 and @xmath202 are significantly better . note that this model does not describe the cluster given by paris and the nearby towns .",
    "clearly , the population density is highest in paris and its surroundings .",
    "consequently , it is reasonable to expect the formation of clusters of towns in this region of france , which is inconsistent with our ansatz of an excluded area .",
    "our analysis has been applied to slads in some 20 countries , with results generally consistent with the above analysis @xcite . as we report in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , there are some subtleties and a rich range of nuances , e.g. , regional differences in the distributions of the areas of counties in the usa .      in analogy with the island nucleation , we can define the voronoi cells or cz for mtro stations as follows .",
    "each mtro station represents a center .",
    "the mtro stations are in competition for passengers in the same way that the islands compete for atoms .",
    "if we suppose that all mtro stations are accessible from anywhere , then most of the passengers within a particular voronoi cell will be `` captured '' by the center of this cell .",
    "of course , this is an oversimplification .",
    "the passengers not only selected a mtro station because of its proximity .",
    "they also take into account ease of access to it ( parking , bus routes , commuting possibilities , road conditions , etc . ) .    as with the slads",
    ", in order to have a good set of data to apply our model , we have to select a city with a near - uniform geographical profile and with a large number of mtro stations .",
    "these conditions are approximately satisfied by the capital of france , paris .",
    "figure  [ paris](a ) shows a scale diagram of the mtro stations of paris ( rer stops are also included ) .",
    "clearly the density of centers ( mtro stations ) is not constant .",
    "naturally , there are more mtro stations near the center of the city , where the population density is highest . because of this , the largest voronoi cells are near the outskirts of the city .",
    "however , we can expect that our npv model works well if we just consider stations near the city center , where the density of mtro stations does not change dramatically , as seen in the enlargement in the figure .    for economic reasons",
    "it is unlikely that two or more mtro stations are very close together .",
    "we then expect @xmath211 because there is an effective `` repulsion force '' between stations . in fig .",
    "[ paris](b ) , we compare the empirical cz distribution of the in - town mtro system with our npv model .",
    "good agreement is found with @xmath210 and @xmath212 ; the gamma function @xmath213 is also included in the comparison presented in fig .",
    "[ paris](b )",
    ". apparently the `` repulsion force '' between mtro stations is bigger than that for island nucleation in 2d .",
    "our proposed npv model can be used to describe and interpret many different systems in terms of two independent distribution functions . in 1d",
    ", @xmath61 gives the probability density to put a new center inside a gap with a scaled size @xmath62 .",
    "this distribution is given explicitly by eq .",
    "( [ pa ] ) and is controlled by the parameter @xmath75 .",
    "this parameter determines the behavior of the gap size distribution for large values of @xmath62 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath90 , @xmath214 , independent of the kernel @xmath76 . additionally , @xmath75 modulates the size dependence of the destruction of gaps . for @xmath215 ,",
    "the probability to put a new center within a gap is the same for all gaps , regardless of their size .",
    "the larger @xmath75 is , the greater is the probability of destruction of large gaps . for the car - parking problem we use @xmath147 , which reflects the preference of drivers to park in large gaps rather than small ones . for island nucleation in 1d",
    "it is necessary to take into account that @xmath75 is a function of the scaled size @xmath105 .    in 1d , the behavior of @xmath142 in the limit @xmath132 is completely determined by the fragmentation kernel @xmath76 . for the kernels considered here , we always have the generic behavior @xmath216 for @xmath217 .",
    "the parameter @xmath99 controls the effective repulsion force between centers . for island nucleation in 1d and the car - parking problem , we found @xmath150 .",
    "for the first system the value of @xmath99 is fully determined by the density of atoms inside the gap in the aggregation regime . in the car - parking problem , @xmath99 reflects the need of the drivers of allow space between cars to perform an exit maneuver .    in 2d ,",
    "the probability density @xmath104 to put a new center inside a voronoi cell is also controlled by the parameter @xmath75 . in the case of the slads",
    ", @xmath73 gives a good fit of the empirical data . because of this",
    ", the @xmath6 of many slads can be approximated by using the single - parameter gamma distribution @xmath57 @xcite . in the case of paris mtro stations we used @xmath210 .",
    "the position * r * of a new center inside a particular voronoi cell in 2d is determined in our model through @xmath218 . for the sake of simplicity , we consider only isotropic cases .",
    "this probability is closely related to the concentration of centers @xmath31 . for example , in the case of island nucleation in two dimensions , a good description of @xmath181 requires taking into account that the density of atoms vanishes along the island boundaries , even though the cz distribution can be well described without taking into account this fact .",
    "this suggests that many different fragmentation models can be used to describe the cz distribution of islands in epitaxial growth .",
    "however , just a few of them fully describe the statistical behavior of the system in a proper way .",
    "an additional example is given by the slads in france .",
    "two different sets of parameters describe @xmath6 properly but just one of them gives a good fit for @xmath201 and @xmath202 .",
    "we defined the czs of mtro stations ; an extension to other systems defined by gas stations , public schools , coffeehouses , post offices , etc .",
    ", is straightforward . in epitaxial growth ,",
    "the cz of an island is related to the islands rate of capturing atoms .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the number of passengers entering a mtro station or the influx of customers patronizing a retailer is intimately related to the size of its cz .",
    "the model presented here allows us to describe quantitatively and qualitatively many systems based on simple assumptions about them .",
    "for example , in the car parking problem we based our model on some assumptions of the driver preferences related with parallel parking .",
    "our ansatz leads to a reasonable description of the gap size distribution . for the description of the cz distributions in the point - island model",
    ", we based our simulation on an estimate of the density of atoms ( besides other observations ) , which comes from the direct numerical simulation of this system . nevertheless , there are systems where the npv patterns are determined by factors difficult to establish as a mathematical expression . in the case of the paris mtro stations ,",
    "it is clear that there is an `` effective repulsion '' between stations because it is not economically viable to put two or more stations too close . in our model",
    "this implies @xmath195 .",
    "however , there are other political , historical , and geographical factors which also affect the cz formation .",
    "something similar happens in the case of the slads .    despite its implicit simplifications ( such as homogeneity and isotropy )",
    ", our model proves to be a powerful tool to describe several complex systems which are defined through an array of points .",

    "for an arbitrary isotropic concentration in a circle of radius @xmath219 , the expected number of particles inside a concentric disk with radius @xmath220 is @xmath221 .",
