    "supersymmetry and supersymmetry breaking are central ideas both in contemporary particle physics and in mathematical physics . in this paper",
    ", we argue that for a large new class of d - brane models there exists a simple geometric criterion which determines whether supersymmetry breaking occurs .",
    "the models of interest are based on calabi - yau singularities with d - branes placed at or near the singularity . by taking a large volume limit ,",
    "it is possible to decouple gravity from the theory , and ignore the calabi - yau geometry far from the branes .",
    "although one typically begins the construction with branes free to move throughout the calabi - yau space , many interesting theories include fractional branes ( or wrapped branes ) , which are d - branes stuck at the singularity and which can not move away from it .",
    "these fractional branes can lead to topology changes in the geometry via gaugino condensation , which can be understood in terms of deformations of the complex structure of the calabi - yau singularity , and result in the replacement of branes by fluxes @xcite .",
    "models of this type , calabi - yau geometries with fluxes , are among the ingredients used to construct viable cosmological models within string theory with a positive cosmological constant @xcite , and which , because of that positivity , ultimately break supersymmetry . with current approaches in the literature , the issue of whether or not supersymmetry breaking is under control is controversial .",
    "it turns out that there exist some singular geometries which admit fractional branes , but for which the associated complex structure deformations are obstructed .",
    "we will argue that in such setups a deformation can still take place , but that the geometric obstruction induces supersymmetry breaking .",
    "given a set of ordinary and fractional branes probing a calabi - yau singularity , supersymmetry breaking by obstructed geometry ( susy - bog ) occurs when the singularity admits fewer deformations than the number of ( anomaly free ) independent fractional branes that one can add to the system .    in this paper",
    "we will show how this breaking occurs in one particular example , d - branes probing the singularity of the calabi - yau cone over the first del pezzo surface , @xmath1 .",
    "this case can be analyzed using the gauge theory / gravity correspondence . in field theory , the mechanism that spontaneously breaks susy is simply gaugino condensation . in terms of the dual gravity theory and its local calabi - yau geometry ,",
    "the deformation obstruction causes the breaking .",
    "the susy - bog adds a new feature to the string theory landscape .",
    "@xmath1 belongs to a large class of singularities for which this geometric obstruction is easy to understand .",
    "we need the technical concept from algebraic geometry of a singularity which is an `` incomplete intersection variety . ''",
    "these varieties are described by @xmath4 equations in @xmath5 variables , where the dimension of the variety is strictly greater than @xmath6 . although the @xmath4 equations or relations are redundant , it is impossible to reduce the number of equations further without changing the geometry . in the case of an incomplete intersection ,",
    "the redundancy makes it hard to deform the equations consistently , giving an obstruction to deformation .",
    "these incomplete intersections are believed to be more generic than `` complete intersections , '' where the dimension of the variety is equal to @xmath6 .    in the dual field theory ,",
    "the @xmath5 complex variables can be associated to generators of the chiral ring of the theory , while the relations in the geometry can be understood as relations in the chiral ring .",
    "we will develop this picture further to make this set of ideas more precise .",
    "a generic property of fractional branes is that they have gaugino condensation on their worldvolume , which translates to non - trivial deformed relations in the chiral ring of the field theory .",
    "when it is possible to deform the equations of the chiral ring consistently , the field theory realizes a supersymmetric vacuum .",
    "if it is impossible to deform the equations in the chiral ring consistently , then the theory spontaneously breaks supersymmetry .",
    "perhaps the prototypical example of a calabi - yau singularity with fractional branes is the conifold singularity , in the setups of klebanov and witten @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and its generalization to the warped deformed conifold geometry of klebanov and strassler ( ks ) @xcite .",
    "the ks solution is an example of a space with no obstruction to deformation , and in this case chiral symmetry breaking and confinement in the strongly coupled dual gauge theory may be identified with the deformation in a precise way .",
    "recall that the construction of the ks solution begins by placing a stack of @xmath7 d3-branes and @xmath8 d5-branes at the tip of the conifold : _",
    "i=1 ^ 4 z_i^2 = 0  .",
    "[ coneq ] the d5-branes are fractional . in the supergravity solution ,",
    "the d - branes are replaced by their corresponding rr five - form and three - form fluxes .",
    "the three - form flux from the d5-branes leads to a singularity unless the conifold is deformed : _",
    "i=1 ^ 4 z_i^2 =  .",
    "[ coneqdef ] this @xmath9 parameter is interpreted as a gaugino condensate in the dual theory and breaks the r - symmetry to @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , cutting off the cone at a radius @xmath9 produces confining behavior of strings in this geometry which are dual to electric flux tubes in the gauge theory .",
    "naively , one could imagine that a very similar phenomenon occurs for the cone over @xmath1 , but there is an obstruction . a theorem by altmann @xcite claims that there are no deformations of this cone .",
    "while the conifold has the single defining equation ( [ coneq ] ) , we recall below that the cone over @xmath1 requires twenty algebraic relations in @xmath11 which are not all independent .",
    "it is impossible to alter all twenty consistently by adding the analog of @xmath9 in ( [ coneqdef ] ) .",
    "the conformal analog of the @xmath1 model with no d5-branes was first proposed separately by kehagias @xcite and by morrison and plesser @xcite as an example of a generalized ads / cft correspondence .",
    "type iib string theory propagating in @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a particular u(1 )",
    "bundle over @xmath1 , is equivalent to a superconformal @xmath14 gauge theory whose field content and superpotential were later derived in @xcite using techniques from toric geometry ( see fig .",
    "[ dp1 ] ) .",
    "recently , the metric on @xmath13 was discovered .",
    "martelli and sparks @xcite have shown that this u(1 ) bundle over @xmath1 , @xmath15 , is a particular example of the @xmath16 sasaki - einstein manifolds found in @xcite . using the explicit metric ,",
    "impressive comparisons of the conformal anomaly coefficients and r - charges between the ads and the cft sides were carried out for @xmath1 in @xcite .    as was the case for the conifold , adding d5-branes to the tip of the cone over @xmath1 breaks conformal invariance and leads to a cascading gauge theory @xcite . recently , a supergravity solution dual to this cascading theory was derived by herzog , ejaz , and klebanov ( hek ) @xcite .",
    "the hek solution shares many of the features of the predecessor of the ks solution , the klebanov - tseytlin ( kt ) solution @xcite . like the kt solution ,",
    "the hek solution is singular in the infrared ( small radius ) ; at large radius , in the ultraviolet , the kt solution approaches the ks solution .",
    "the large radius region can be used to calculate geometrically the nsvz beta functions and logarithmic running in the number of colors , and this geometric behavior matches our field theoretic understanding of a duality cascade .",
    "however , there currently is no known analog of the ks solution for @xmath1 that smooths the singularity in the infrared . the motivation behind this research was to understand the infrared physics of @xmath1 .      since the calabi - yau deformations are obstructed , we argue that supersymmetry is broken at the bottom of the duality cascade for @xmath1 .",
    "our argument has three field theoretic legs .",
    "first we argue that there is no superconformal fixed point to which the cascading theory may flow , ruling out strong coupling behavior that is not confinement .",
    "next , turning on fayet - iliopoulos terms in the field theory , we show that the theory should confine in the infrared .",
    "last , using the konishi anomaly @xcite , we show there are no solutions to the f - term equations .",
    "the last step requires some immediate clarification .",
    "the field theory analysis is well suited for studying vacua where mesonic operators get expectation values  the mesonic branch  and is less so for the baryonic branch .",
    "we will show that the mesonic branch of the @xmath1 field theory spontaneously breaks supersymmetry .",
    "we have a traditional field theory argument that supersymmetry is not preserved along the baryonic branch , but the argument is not as rigorous as the konishi anomaly approach . it may be that there exists a supersymmetric , pure flux supergravity solution ( which does not involve a calabi - yau manifold ) , similar to the recent @xmath17 structure solutions of @xcite . recall that the ks solution represents a particular point in the baryonic branch of the conifold field theory @xcite . as one moves along the baryonic branch , one finds that the geometry is no longer calabi - yau but is instead an @xmath17 structure solution where probe d3-branes break supersymmetry .    for generic initial number of d3- and d5-branes in the uv ,",
    "we expect to have left - over d3-branes at the bottom of the cascade .",
    "the ks solution represents a particular point in the baryonic branch where these d3-branes will remain supersymmetric .",
    "however , even if there is an @xmath17 structure solution for @xmath1 , the left - over d3-branes will always break supersymmetry .",
    "we emphasize that the supersymmetry breaking is an infrared effect .",
    "the warp factor in the geometry will lead to an exponential separation between the ultraviolet and infrared scales , giving a natural way of achieving low - scale supersymmetry breaking should we embed this cone over @xmath1 in a compact calabi - yau .",
    "an optimistic point of view is that one might be able to build supergravity solutions from compactified versions of this cone over @xmath1 , and using these solutions , produce realistic cosmological models similar to @xcite where all stringy moduli are stabilized and supersymmetry is broken in a controlled way .",
    "such solutions deserve further study .",
    "the quiver theory for the first del pezzo has four gauge groups and a number of bifundamental fields conveniently summarized using a quiver diagram ( see fig .",

    "@xmath24 , the gauge theory has a superconformal fixed point with an ads / cft dual description : type iib string theory in a @xmath25 background .",
    "adding @xmath8 d5-branes breaks the superconformal symmetry and starts a seiberg duality cascade , as argued in @xcite . in the limit @xmath26",
    ", we can calculate the nsvz @xmath22-functions and find that generically the @xmath27 group runs to strong coupling first as the energy scale decreases .",
    "taking the seiberg dual of the @xmath27 group yields the same quiver and superpotential but with @xmath28 , i.e. the number of d3-branes slowly decreases with energy scale .    before tackling the problem of what happens when @xmath7 becomes of order @xmath8 , we would like to demonstrate how the geometry of the first del pezzo can be recovered from the f - term relations of this gauge theory .",
    "the superpotential ( [ wdp1 ] ) gives rise to the ten classical f - term equations = 0  , one for each @xmath29 , where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , or @xmath34 .",
    "we list these ten equations : @xmath35    to see the geometry emerge from the f - term equations , we study the spectrum of chiral primary operators of the schematic form = ( x_i_1 x_i_2 x_i_3  x_i_n )  , [ chpr ] where we contract all of the color indices to form a gauge invariant operator .",
    "the trace structure means that these gauge invariant operators will correspond to loops in the quiver diagram .",
    "the reason this expression ( [ chpr ] ) is schematic is that the actual chiral primary operator will be a polynomial of such traces .",
    "the traces generate the chiral ring .",
    "just as we think of harmonic forms as representatives of classes in cohomology , we can think of a chiral primary operator as a representative of a class of operators related by the f - term equations . by only giving a single trace",
    ", we are really specifying a class of such operators related to each other by the f - term equations .",
    "there are six types of operators that loop just once around the quiver @xmath36 u_r^z u_l^y_3 ; u_r^z u_l^v^  . from these six building blocks",
    ", we can form any operator of the form ( [ chpr ] ) .",
    "the final trace will always be over the gauge group in the lower right hand corner of the quiver .",

    "we now study what happens when we assemble these blocks into larger operators .",
    "we find that @xmath41 the @xmath42 has been added as a guide to the eye .",
    "similar types of manipulation reveal also that these blocks commute with one another .",
    "in particular u_r^y_2 y_3 u_r^z u_l^y_3 = u_r^z u_l^y_3 u_r^y_2 y_3  , and that u_r^z u_l^y_3 u_r^z u_l^v^= u_r^z u_l^v^u_r^z u_l^y_3  .",
    "finally , with a little more work , one can show that any product of the ( [ threeblock ] ) is symmetric in the @xmath20 indices .    from these assembled facts ,",

    "this absence helps rule out strong coupling behaviors in the ir field theory which are not gaugino condensation .",
    "a necessary condition for the presence of a superconformal fixed point in a gauge theory is the vanishing of the nsvz beta functions and the requirement that the superpotential be marginal .",

    "in this section , we will relate the @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 building blocks of the chiral ring directly to the metric coordinates on the calabi - yau cone .",
    "it turns out that it is just as easy to work out the relationship for all the @xmath16 at once .      for the metric to be complete , b = -  . the coordinate @xmath51 is allowed to range between the two smaller roots of the cubic @xmath238 : @xmath239 the period of @xmath21 is @xmath240 where = -  .",
    "the remaining coordinates are allowed the following ranges : @xmath241 , @xmath242 , and @xmath243 .",
