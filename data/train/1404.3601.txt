    "indeed some excited states of different nuclei in this mass region are known to present pronounced cluster structures .",
    "these correlations may persist in the ground state along some selected isotopic chains  @xcite , and according to the ikeda diagrams  @xcite alpha - clustered excited states are massively expected at high excitation energies close to the multi - alpha decay threshold in all even - even @xmath4 nuclei .",
    "these cluster structures have been evidenced in constrained density functional calculations  @xcite close to the threshold energy of breakup into constituent clusters and even beyond .",
    "they should lead to exotic non - statistical decays with a privileged break - up into the cluster constituents which start to be identified in the recent literature  @xcite .",
    "such effects might be experimentally seen as an excess of cluster production with respect to the prediction of the statistical model , provided that the ingredients of the latter are sufficiently constrained via experimental data .",
    "it is important to recall that the final inclusive yields represent integrated contributions over the whole evaporation chain .",
    "because of that , the information they bear on specific excitation energy regions of the different nuclei explored during the evaporation process may be model dependent  @xcite unless the decay chain is fully controlled in a coincidence experiment . to progress on these issues",

    "this model , which has also been largely and successfully used by the nuclear physics community since more than 20 years , includes the emission of intermediate mass fragments within the transition state formalism .",

    "we can however remark that gemini++ overpredicts events of high multiplicity .",
    "this means that the transition state formalism is not entirely satisfactory in describing the production of light fragment , which could also be due to a breakup mechanism .",
    "such a mechanism is not accounted for in the presented models .",
    "apart from the missing @xmath125 channel , another discrepancy between the hf@xmath6 calculation and the data concerns the @xmath126 yield which is underestimated by the model .",
    "this extra yield could in principle be explained by the transition state model , as shown by the fact that data are well reproduced in this channel by gemini++ . as an alternative explanation ,",
    "the carbon excess with respect to hf@xmath6 predictions could be due to the entrance channel of the reaction .",

    "the excitation energy which would be associated to this event assuming that the residue has @xmath161 and is produced in its ground state is : @xmath162 the example of oxygen is reported in figure  [ fig_calo1 ] .",

    "the qualitative agreement with the model calculations confirms once again that the selected events largely correspond to complete fusion .    in the hypothesis that the kinetic energies of lcp and neutrons depend on average on the channel , but not on the average value of the residue mass ( through @xmath165 ) , ( [ calo1 ] ) and  ( [ calo2 ] ) can be averaged over the events of the channel giving : @xmath166    eqs .

    "the resulting isotopic distributions are presented in figure  [ fig_calo3 ] , again compared to the model calculations .",
    "errors on experimental results have been obtained combining the statistical error with the one coming from the reconstruction procedure .",

    "both the average and the width of the distributions are reproduced by the model .",
    "the distributions are generally bell - shaped and structureless , with the exception of carbon , which shows an important depletion for @xmath172c similarly to the model calculation .",
    "the case of oxygen is particularly interesting .",
    "the experimental and theoretical widths are comparable , but while the experimental distribution has a negative skewness and it is centered on the neutron poor @xmath173o , the opposite is seen in the calculation which favours neutron rich isotopes and presents a positive skewness  @xcite . as we can see in figure  [ fig_calo1 ] , this is largely due to the specific @xmath174 channel .",
    "indeed this channel is the only one which leads to a non - negligible production of @xmath173o .    the information from the isotopic distribution and the energy spectra coherently points towards an increased probability for the @xmath174 channel with respect to the statistical model .",

    "a disagreement is present , but the theoretical calculation well reproduces the shape of the @xmath2 spectrum , as shown in figure  [ dyde_residuo ] .",

    "a similar analysis for oxygen is presented in figure  [ c+oa_br ] ( lower panels ) . the same considerations as for carbon apply in this case .",
    "again , the extra yield associated with multiple @xmath2 events with respect to the statistical model leads to a broader spectrum extending towards higher @xmath2 energies .",
    "if we now compare experimental data with model predictions in specific channels , we obtain , for the carbon case ( see figure  [ cac_br ] , upper panels ) , that the shape of the spectra of the different channels are very well reproduced by the statistical model calculations .",
    "the same holds true for the angular distributions , well reproduced by calculations .",
    "this shows that the kinematics of the decay is well described by a sequential evaporation mechanism .",
    "however these shapes depend on the channel , multiple @xmath2 s leading to spectra which are less steep and extend further in energy , with respect to channels where hydrogens are also present . because of that , the disagreement in branching ratios between model and data shown in table i affects the global shape of the @xmath2 spectrum , where the different channels are summed up .",
    "taking now into account the oxygen residue , in figure  [ oac_br ] we show the comparison of the energy spectra ( upper panels ) and angular distributions . at variance with the carbon case ,",
    "the shape of the @xmath2 spectrum and the angular distribution in the @xmath174 channel are not well reproduced by the statistical model .",
    "this means that the kinematics in this channel is not compatible with cn decay , and suggests a contamination from direct reactions .",
    "the anomalously high probability of multiple @xmath2 emission in coincidence with oxygen and carbon residues , with respect to the expectation from a statistical behaviour , can explain the deviations observed in the inclusive @xmath2 observables ( see figures  [ dyde_p_a_10_12 ] and [ angdist_p_a ] ) .",
    "this suggests that non - statistical processes are at play in the experimental sample concerning the two specific multiple @xmath2 channels that show anomalously high branching ratios .",
    "alpha production is known to be an important outcome of direct @xmath0c+@xmath0c reactions  @xcite . in these studies , though at lower bombarding energy than the present experiment , the @xmath2 dominance has been associated with quasi - molecular two - carbon excited states with a pronounced @xmath2 structure .    in order to see",
    "if similar effects still persist at higher bombarding energies , in the second paper of the series we will focus on a detailed analysis of the multiple @xmath2 channels .",
    "in this work we have presented results for the @xmath0c(@xmath0c , x ) reaction at 95 mev beam energy , measured at lnl - infn with the garfield+rco experimental set - up .",
    "starting from a minimal selection of the fusion - evaporation mechanism , based on the coincidence between lcp s emitted over a wide polar angle range ( garfield ) and a fragment detected at laboratory forward angles ( rco ) , reinforced by completeness conditions on the total detected charge and longitudinal momentum , we have compared experimental data to statistical model calculations for the decay of the @xmath1mg@xmath184 cn issued in case of complete fusion .",
    "the selected sample is compatible with the expected behaviour of a complete - fusion - evaporation reaction , with the exception of two specific channels significantly more populated than predicted by the hf@xmath6 calculations .",
    "these channels correspond to the emission of two or three @xmath2 particles in coincidence with an oxygen or carbon residue , respectively .",
    "the @xmath2 spectra and angular distributions in the @xmath185 channel are not compatible with statistical model calculation .",
    "this suggests a contamination from direct reactions or @xmath2-structure correlations in the @xmath1 mg compound  @xcite .",
    "this is not the case for the @xmath186 channel , and the anomalously high branching ratio of this channel can be tentatively attributed to a possible persistence at high excitation energy of @xmath2 structure correlations in the @xmath0c+@xmath0c molecular state and/or in the @xmath1 mg compound .",
    "the kinematic characteristics of these non - statistical decays are further studied in the continuation of this work  @xcite .",
    "the results of the analysis show that our data can be used to constrain the ingredients of the statistical model in the @xmath187 , @xmath188 amev mass - excitation - energy region of interest .",
    "in particular , this analysis supports a model showing a very steep increase of the level density with excitation energy .",
