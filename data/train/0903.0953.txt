    "there is an increasing interest in long - living , spatially localized classical solutions in field theories  _ oscillons _  exhibiting nearly periodic oscillations in time @xcite@xcite .",
    "for the two and more spatial dimensional sine - gordon theory , following the original naming in @xcite , these objects are generally called pulsons @xcite@xcite .",
    "oscillons resemble the `` true '' ( time periodic and of finite energy ) breathers of the one - dimensional sine - gordon ( sg ) theory , but unlike true breathers they are continuously losing energy by radiating slowly . just like a breather , an oscillon possesses a localized `` core '' , but it also has a `` radiative '' region outside of the core .",
    "oscillons appear from rather generic initial data in the course of time evolution , in an impressive number of physically relevant theories including the bosonic sector of the standard model @xcite@xcite .",
    "moreover they form in physical processes making them of considerable importance @xcite@xcite .",
    "a crucial physical characteristic of oscillons is the amplitude of the outgoing wave determining their lifetime . in a previous work we have been able to perform an analytic calculation of the radiation amplitude of oscillons in scalar theories in the limit of small oscillon amplitudes in one spatial dimension @xcite . in this limit",
    "one can perform an expansion yielding breather - like configurations with spatially localized cores .",
    "the small - amplitude expansion yields an asymptotic series for the core , but misses a standing wave tail whose amplitude is exponentially small with respect to that of the core @xcite .",
    "therefore in order to compute the radiative amplitude , more precisely its leading part , implies to go beyond all orders in perturbation theory . in the present paper building on the results of @xcite",
    "we develop a method to compute the radiation amplitude in @xmath1 and @xmath2 spatial dimensions in the small - amplitude expansion .",
    "the main result of this paper can be summarized by the following simple formula determining the energy loss of a small - amplitude oscillon in @xmath3 spatial dimensions ( @xmath4 ) : @xmath5 where @xmath6 are given in eq . as functions of @xmath3 and of the coefficients of the scalar potential .",
    "although our analytic calculations are carried out in the limit of the oscillon amplitude going to zero , the results are valid for non infinitesimal values of the amplitude .",
    "we have found satisfactory agreement between the predicted energy loss eq . and",
    "the `` measured '' one ( by numerical simulations ) for the sg theory in @xmath1 and @xmath2 and in a @xmath0-type model investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite in @xmath1 .",
    "our results also imply that no breathers depending on continuous parameters can exist for @xmath7 for arbitrary scalar potentials .",
    "note that in @xmath8 the sg theory is the _ only _ one with analytic potential admitting a breather family @xcite .",
    "we consider spherically symmetric solutions of a real scalar theory in a @xmath9 dimensional minkowski space - time , with a self - interaction potential @xmath10 .",
    "the equation of motion is @xmath11 the mass of the field is chosen to be @xmath12 , and the derivative of the potential @xmath10 is expanded as a power series in @xmath13 , where the @xmath14 are constants . in the following unless otherwise stated we shall consider potentials which are symmetric around their minima , i.e.  @xmath15 .    the small - amplitude expansion of solutions of eq .",
    "can be written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the expansion parameter .",
    "demanding the functions @xmath18 be bounded they all turn out to be periodic in time . for the class of symmetric potentials",
    "@xmath19 , @xmath20 , and the first two non - vanishing amplitudes are given as @xmath21 where @xmath22 , the frequency , @xmath23 , and the functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 depend only on the radial coordinate @xmath26 . introducing @xmath27 and @xmath28 by @xmath29 the constants @xmath14 get eliminated from the equations determining @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath30 where a rescaled radial coordinate has been introduced through @xmath31 .",
    ".   admits regular solutions decaying exponentially in dimensions @xmath4 , implying similar properties for the regular solutions of eq .  .",
    "from now on we will only discuss the fundamental solution of eq .   without nodes . on solutions with nodes see ref .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath32 , @xmath33 , are determined by linear inhomogeneous equations analogous to , and they all decay exponentially .",
    "the small amplitude series does not converge in general  it is an _ asymptotic _ one .",
    "this is closely related to the fact that no true breathers exist in generic theories because of the radiative degrees of freedom .",
    "nevertheless the asymptotic series yields an excellent approximation for the spatially localized `` core '' part of the oscillon ( for details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it turns out that the radiative amplitude of an oscillon is of the order of @xmath34 i.e.  beyond reach of finite order perturbation theory in @xmath35 .",
    "as found in ref.@xcite any slowly radiating oscillon solution can be well approximated by a suitable exactly time periodic , `` quasibreather '' ( qb ) having a well - localized core and an inevitable standing wave tail , whose amplitude is in some sense minimal . in section 4 .",
    "the amplitude of this standing wave tail and that of the outgoing radiation will be directly related . to find this amplitude using the segur - kruskal method @xcite , we have to analytically continue our functions to the complex plane and find the singularities closest to the real axis as a first step . because ( [ e : eqz ] ) is linear in @xmath28 its solution has a singularity exactly where @xmath27 has .",
    "thus , we have to find the singularities of the master equation ( [ e : eqs ] ) . in the neighbourhood of the closest singularity to the real axis",
    "we compute the nonperturbative correction , which determines the radiation field of the oscillon after matching it to the solution on the real axis .",
    "@xmath27 has simple pole singularities on the imaginary axis at @xmath36 .",
    "let us measure the distances from the upper singularity as @xmath37 then the solution of ( [ e : eqs ] ) for small @xmath38 can be written in the following series form @xmath39 we note that for @xmath7 the series ( [ e : srser ] ) will also contain non - analytic terms , the lowest order being @xmath40 .",
    "the position of the pole can be determined both by pad s approximation and by integrating the master equation numerically along the imaginary axis .",
    "table [ t : pole ] gives the results of these numerical approaches .",

    "the vertical line corresponds to the energy minimum at @xmath41 .",
    "points to the left of the line correspond to stable oscillon states , while the others to states having one decay mode , requiring a one - parameter tuning .",
    "[ fig3],width=321 ]    for the @xmath1 case , we can again use the semiempirical formula , where now @xmath42 . according to",
    ", the theoretical value of @xmath43 is @xmath44 , and for the other parameter , obviously @xmath45 .",
    "first we fitted both @xmath43 and @xmath46 , obtaining @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "fitting only @xmath43 while fixing @xmath45 we got @xmath49 . similarly to the @xmath0 theory , the pole term can be measured quite precisely , but the amplitude has larger errors .",
    "motivated by , in the @xmath2 case we use the semiempirical formula @xmath50 where @xmath42 .",
    "the theoretical values are @xmath51 and @xmath45 .",
    "the fit for @xmath52 yields @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "again , the pole term is precise , but the amplitude has larger error . setting @xmath45 and fitting only for @xmath43 does not help in this case , it gives about half of the theoretical value , @xmath55 .",
    "most probably this discrepancy is due the nonlinear effects related to the still too large values of @xmath35 .",
    "since the energy loss rate falls exponentially with @xmath35 , our time evolution code can not provide reliable results for smaller @xmath35 values .",
