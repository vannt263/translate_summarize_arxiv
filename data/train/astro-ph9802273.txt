    "interest in the star hd  197770 ( hr  7940 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) increased greatly with the discovery that its line - of - sight has a polarization feature coincident with the 2175    extinction bump ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . out of the 30 sightlines with uv spectropolarimetry , such a polarization bump has only been seen along one other sightline ( @xcite ) .",
    "hd  197770 has long been known to have a variable radial velocity ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "observations originally intended to study the sightline towards hd  197770 have shown it to be a double - lined spectroscopic binary ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recent photometric observations have shown that hd  197770 is an eclipsing binary ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we obtained spectra of hd  197770 between 1992 and 1997 in order to determine the spectroscopic orbit of hd  197770 .",
    "the spectroscopic orbit , coupled with the eclipsing nature of the binary , allowed us to determine the masses of the binary components .",
    "in 1992 june and october , observations of hd  197770 were acquired at the kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) 0.9 m coud feed telescope using the coud spectrograph .",
    "the june observation was obtained using an chelle grating and a cross disperser grism to give disjoint orders between 3870 and 4085    with a resolution of 120,000 .",
    "it was reduced using iraf .",
    "the october observations also used an chelle grating and a cross disperser grism giving orders which covered 55807160    ( hjd 2448901.6 ) or 39904490    ( hjd 2448902.6 & 2448903.6 ) at a resolution of 80,000 . between 1996",
    "september and 1997 october , 17 observations of hd  197770 were taken at the 1 m ritter observatory telescope using a fiber - fed chelle spectrograph ( @xcite ) .",
    "these observations cover nine disjoint 70   - orders between 5200 and 6600    at a resolution of 25,000 .",
    "the kpno and ritter observations were reduced using a package written to reduce ritter observations .",
    "since the kpno observations were not acquired with a fiber - fed chelle , the orders were extracted using a direct sum method instead of the profile - weighted method used for the ritter observations .",
    "details of the reduction package can be found in gordon & mulliss ( 1997 ) .",

    "from inspection of the spectra , we found that the lines of the two components of hd  197770 were never fully separated .",
    "figure  [ fig_ex_line ] displays the @xmath96578  line for typical kpno and ritter spectra .",
    "the separation of the components in the two spectra are similar and the double - lined nature of this binary is clearly seen , especially in the kpno spectrum .",
    "the lines are clearly resolved in the kpno spectrum , but not in the ritter spectrum .",
    "we identify the broad line as component a of this binary and the narrow line as component b. since the lines were never fully separated , blending effects are always present .",
    "therefore , we used todcor , the 2d cross correlation algorithm presented in zucker & mazeh ( 1994 ) , to measure the radial velocities .",
    "this algorithm takes model spectra of the two components as input and finds the optimal radial velocities of the two components and their luminosity ratio .    as results of todcor",
    "are sensitive to the assumed model spectra , we constrained the model atmosphere parameters as follows . the effective temperature ( @xmath10 ) for hd 197770 , derived using a reddening - free photometric index , is @xmath11 k ( @xcite ) .",
    "we checked this @xmath10 by comparing the ultraviolet through v band dereddened spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of hd  197770 with phoenix lte model seds ( @xcite ) .",
    "the sed of hd  197770 was taken from international ultraviolet explorer ( _ iue _ ) and ubv ( @xcite ) observations and dereddened assuming a @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the unreddened sed was well fit by a model with a @xmath14  k and @xmath15 .",
    "in addition , since the eclipse depths are similar , the @xmath16 of both stars must be close to 21,000  k ( @xcite ) .",
    "we used a phoenix lte model sed with a @xmath14  k and a @xmath17 for both stars for the todcor algorithm .",
    "the @xmath18 values were determined by iteratively running todcor and adjusting the @xmath19 values until the composite model spectrum matched , by inspection , the @xmath206578,6582 doublet in the hjd 2448901.6 spectrum ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the strength of the model spectrum lines were reduced by 40% to match the observed strengths of the lines .",
    "this can be traced to the fact that the model spectrum had solar abundances and most b - type stars are underabundant compared to the sun ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the hjd 2448901.6 spectrum and the best fitting composite model spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig_vsini ] .",
    "the best fit @xmath22 values were 55 and 15  km  s@xmath3 for components a and b , respectively . the todcor determined luminosity ratio ( @xmath23 ) was @xmath242 .",
    "using todcor , we were able to measure the radial velocity of the narrow , but not the broad , component in all of the spectra .",
    "we were able to accurately measure the broad component in only the 1992 october kpno spectra .",
    "the 1992 june kpno spectrum gave us radial velocities for both components , but neither was measured with great accuracy due to the low signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) .",
    "the resolution and s / n of the ritter spectra were not high enough to allow us to measure the velocity of the broad component ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_ex_line ] ) . as a result",
    ", the orbital motion of the narrow component was well sampled , but the orbital motion of the broad component was only measured 4 times , 3 times accurately .",
    "we fit the narrow component radial velocities using all but the hjd 2450360.6 measurement .",
    "this one radial velocity is quite deviant ( @xmath25 from final fit , @xmath26  km  s@xmath3 ) and a much better fit is achieved by rejecting this point .",
    "we fit the 3 good measurements of the broad component to determine @xmath27 . for this fit",
    ", we assumed all the other orbital parameters were those determined from the narrow component fit , except @xmath28 .",
    "the resulting orbital parameters are listed in table  [ table_orbit ] .",
    "the values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 were then computed from the orbital parameters .",
    "figure  [ fig_orbit ] plots the measured radial velocities along with the radial velocities calculated from the orbital motion fits .",
    "columns 5 - 9 of table  [ table_obs ] give the phase , measured radial velocites ( o ) , and observed minus calculated ( o - c ) radial velocities .",

    "since hd  197770 exhibits shallow eclipses ( @xmath48 ) , its inclination must be near @xmath49 ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the values quoted in table  [ table_orbit ] for @xmath50 are close to the actual masses of the components . comparing an unpublished pine bluff observatory ( pbo ) spectrum of hd  197770 to the spectra presented in walborn & fitzpatrick ( 1990 )",
    ", we find the spectral class to be b1  v - iii or b2  iii for both stars combined .",
    "considering both the pbo spectrum and the @xmath10 value determined in ",
    "[ sec_analysis ] , the most likely spectral type is b2  iii .",
    "all lines in the spectra of hd  197770 are double , leading to the conclusion that both stars have similar spectral types . assuming the radii of a b2  iii star ( 12  r@xmath51 ; @xcite ) for both components , the inclination of this eclipsing binary is @xmath52 .",
    "the masses of components a & b are then @xmath53 and 2.2  m@xmath51 , respectively .",
    "a normal b2  iii star has a mass around 15 m@xmath51 ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , both components of this binary are undermassive for their given spectral types .",
    "this marks both components as evolved stars .",
    "hd  197770 lies in the cygnus region on the edge of cyg ob7 and cep ob2 .",
    "it seems to be very near and possibly on the edge of a molecular cloud / star formation region including lynds  1036 and 1049 .",
    "hd  197770 is associated with two iras point sources , iras  20420 + 5655 and 20418 + 5700 , but it is clearly non - stellar on the iras map at 60  .",
    "figure  [ fig_all_four ] displays the @xmath54 region centered on hd  197770 for the iras 12 , 25 , 60 , 100  bands .",
    "the ir sed peaks at 60  implying warm dust in the immediate vicinity of the binary ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the 60  shell with a radius of 14@xmath55 , the iras map shows the signature of an apparent bubble of cleared dust with a radius of approximately @xmath56 .",
    "this bubble is easiest to see in the 60 and 100  images , but is also present in the 25  image .",
    "the dark regions in the upper and lower right hand corners of the images mark the edge of a molecular cloud which has been mapped in co ( @xcite ) .",
    "the molecular cloud wraps around three sides of hd  197770 roughly surrounding the evacuated area in the iras map . in particular , to the west of hd  197770 is a buried young stellar object ( lynds  1036 ) and to the east of hd  197770 is a pulsar ( @xcite ) .",
    "so sequential star formation seems possible although the pulsar may be a background object . in any event",
    ", the hd  197770 binary appears to have formed on the edge of this cloud and cleared out an area around it .",
    "the association of hd  197770 with this cloud allows us to use the distance to the cloud ( 440  pc ; @xcite ) as an estimate of the distance to hd  197770 .",
    "the existence of ir flux peaking at 60  at the position of hd  197770 and bubble of cleared dust surrounding hd  197770 imply that this binary has undergone at least two episodes of mass loss .",
    "a measurement of the luminosity of this binary would greatly help in determining its evolutionary stage , but the distance to the system is not known .",
    "hipparcos gives a parallax of @xmath57  mas which results in a @xmath58 lower limit on the distance of 495  pc .",
    "this is consistent with the `` guilt by association '' distance given in the last paragraph . by assuming the distance to hd  197770 is 440  pc , @xmath59 , and @xmath14  k , we can estimate the luminosity and radii of the components of this binary .",
    "the resulting luminosities and radii are @xmath60  l@xmath51 ( @xmath61 ) and 7.4  r@xmath51 for hd  197770  a and @xmath62  l@xmath51 ( @xmath63 ) and 5.2  r@xmath51 for hd  197770  b. these radii result in an inclination for the binary of @xmath64 and , thus , masses of @xmath243.0 and 2.0  m@xmath51 for hd  197770  a & b , respectively .",
    "we note the similarity between this system and the eclipsing binary @xmath65  sgr ( @xmath66  m@xmath51 , @xmath67  m@xmath51 , & @xmath68  r@xmath51 ; @xcite ) for which the primary is a hydrogen - deficient a - type supergiant and the secondary has a spectral type of b2  ib ( @xcite ) . according to plavec ( 1973 ) and schoenberner & drilling ( 1983 )",
    ", the system is the result of type bb binary evolution , where the primary is now a post - agb star .",
    "uomoto ( 1986 ) has discussed the possibility that such systems are progenitors of ib - type supernovae .",
    "two kinds of additional observations are needed of this binary .",
    "first , high resolution ( r  @xmath69 ) and high s / n optical spectra are needed spaced throughout the @xmath24100 day orbit .",
    "these observations would confirm the k - amplitude of component a which is currently only based on three measurements .",
    "second , imaging with an optical interferometer would give an accurate distance measurement when coupled to the results of this work .",
    "the navy prototype optical interferometer could perform this imaging when it is fully operational ( @xcite ) .",
    "calculation of each star s luminosity would help in understanding their evolution stage .",
    "the ritter observations were possible only with the help of the ritter technician bob burmeister and the crack ritter observing team .",
