    "in a recent communication @xcite , we have reported the results of pseudoscalar decay constants of heavy - light mesons in a qcd potential model with linear part of the potential as perturbation .",
    "the technique used was the quantum mechanical perturbation theory with plausible relativistic correction .",
    "+ in this paper , we extend the qcd potential model with its input parameters towards the semeleptonic decays to study the isgur - wise function .",
    "exclusive semileptonic decays of hadrons containing a bottom quark provide a path to measure the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa(ckm ) matrix elements @xmath5,an important parameter to test the standard model .",
    "it is well - known in the literature that in case of heavy to heavy transitions like @xmath6 decays , all heavy quark bilinear current matrix elements are described in terms of only one form factor , which is called the isgur - wise(iw ) function in leading order .",
    "the iw function , particularly its slope ( @xmath7)at the zero recoil point is important since it allows a model independent way to determine the ckm element @xmath8 for the semileptonic decay of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "this method of obtaining the ckm element within the framework of heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) was proposed by neubert@xcite .",
    "he observed that the zero recoil point is suitable for the extraction of ckm element @xmath8 .",
    "the method basically relies on the existence of one universal form factor(isgur - wise function ) and the fact that the form factor is unaffected from @xmath11 @xmath12 corrections at zero recoil . + here ,",
    "we compute the slope @xmath0 and curvature @xmath1 of the isgur - wise funcion for @xmath2 meson and then obtain the ckm element @xmath5 . in section 2 , we discuss the formalism and summarise the results and conclusion in section 3 . +",
    "the wavefunction obtained by using the dalgarno method of perturbation with linear part of the cornell potential as perturbation is being discussed in ref.@xcite . for completeness",
    "we write the wavefunction here again .",
    "@xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 the qcd potential is taken as @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the undetermined factor appearing in the series solution of the schrdinger equation.however with @xmath20=0 the effect of c vanishes entirely from the solution . + the corresponding normalised wavefunction in momentum space is@xcite : @xmath21.\\ ] ]      in case of weak decay like the semileptonic @xmath22 decay , the amplitude is a product of two matrix elements , the hadronic weak current@xmath23 and the leptonic weak current@xmath24 with its vector @xmath25 and axial vector @xmath26 i.e @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 .    since both the @xmath2 and @xmath30 mesons are pseudoscalar @xmath31 , so from the consideration of lorentz covariance and parity one has @xmath32 and there remains the vector part    @xmath33    where @xmath34 and@xmath35 are two form factors .",

    "+ however , in the limit of infinitely heavy quark masses @xmath38 , a new heavy flavour symmetry appears in the effective lagrangian of the standard model which provides the model independent normalisation of the weak form factors in the framework of hqet .",
    "+ in the heavy - quark limit the masses of the heavy quarks and consequently , the masses of the heavy hadrons are taken to be infinite .",
    "this leads to an additional symmetry which is known as the heavy flavour symmetry . with the hadron masses their momenta",
    "also go to infinity but the hadron four velocities remain finite in this symmetry .",
    "one is then interested in the dependence of form factors on the ( finite ) velocity product @xmath39 .",
    "moreover , the heavy quark symmetry is an approximate symmetry and correction arises since the quark masses are not infinite .",
    "this correction may be studied systematically in the framework of hqet .",
    "the leading symmetry - breaking corrections are from the terms of the order of @xmath40 .although the relative corrections can be calculated using perturbative qcd , the @xmath41 corrections produce new uncalculable functions . for @xmath36 decay there",
    "are found to be four such uncalculable functions .",
    "hence the predictive power of the theory is reduced .",
    "isgur , wise , georgi and others@xcite showed that in case of weak semileptonic decays of @xmath22 or @xmath36 , all the form factors are expressible in terms of a single universal function of velocity transfer , which is normalized to unity at zero recoil .",
    "this universal function is known as the isgur - wise function , which measures the overlap of the wave functions of the light degrees of freedom in the initial and final mesons moving with velocities @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively .",
    "+      in the heavy quark limit close to @xmath44 , the isgur - wise function is written as : @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 and @xmath48 being the four velocity of the heavy meson before and after the decay.the quantity @xmath0 is the slope of i - w function at @xmath44 and known as charge radius : + @xmath49 the second order derivative is the curvature of the i - w function known as convexity parameter : + @xmath50 for the heavy - light flavor mesons the i - w function can also be written as @xcite : + @xmath51 where + @xmath52 upon integration of eqn.[eqn : ch5,iw2 ] one obtains@xcite @xmath53   \\nonumber\\\\ + \\frac{4n^{\\prime2}a_{0}^{4}\\mu^{4}\\left(y-1 \\right)^{2}}{2^{5 - 2\\epsilon } }   \\left [ \\gamma\\left(4 - 2\\epsilon\\right)\\left\\{\\frac{5 - 2\\epsilon}{8 } + \\frac{3 - 2\\epsilon}{3}+ \\frac{\\left(3 - 2\\epsilon \\right)^{2}}{4 } + \\frac{\\left(3 - 2\\epsilon\\right)^{3}}{24 } \\right\\}\\right .",

    "+      in the perturbation procedure , the convergence point of view demands from the eqn.[eqn : ch5,8 ] that @xmath56 this condition provides a lower limit of @xmath57 in the model to incorporate a small value of @xmath58(@xmath59 ) .",
    "again the reality condition of @xmath60 provides an upper limit of @xmath61 . hence the condition of equation.([eqn : ch5,9 ] ) allows a range of @xmath62 in the model to treat the linear part of the potential as perturbation with its model parameters .",
    "+ instead of using a free strong coupling constant @xmath55 within this range , we therefore consider the strong running coupling constant appeared in the potential @xmath63 , is related to the quark mass parameter as@xcite @xmath64 where , @xmath65 is the number of flavours , @xmath66 is the renormalisation scale related to the constituent quark masses as @xmath67 and @xmath68 is the background mass .",
    "the background mass is not an arbitrary parameter and can be calculated in the frame work of lattice qcd .",
    "the apperance of mass @xmath68 in eqn.[eqn : faustovalpha ] is similar to the case of qed where @xmath69 has the mass of @xmath70 pair under logarithm @xcite .",
    "here we relate the background mass to the confinement term of the potential as @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "+ in studying leptonic decay @xcite , the value of @xmath72 was fixed in the eqn.[eqn : faustovalpha ] to obtain the value of running background coupling @xmath55 . in the case of leptonic decay of charged mesons ,",
    "the quark and antiquark annihilate to produce a virtual @xmath73 boson such that @xmath74 and hence we get only one form factor , the decay constant @xmath75 which absorb all the strong interaction effects . in the case of semileptonic decay , however the case is different since @xmath76 is different for event to event and hence more than one form factor appears .",
    "this decrease of @xmath76 in semileptonic decay leads us to consider a larger value of @xmath77 in compared to that of the leptonic decay which effectively increases the strong coupling constant @xmath78 .",
    "the physically plaussible range of effective @xmath77 should in principle be deduced from the allowed bands of the slope and curvature of the i - w function .",
    "considering the theoretical bounds on slope @xmath79@xcite and curvature @xmath80@xcite , we draw a curve for the variation of i - w function for @xmath2 meson and is shown in fig.1 .",
    "the allowed range of @xmath0 provides a range of @xmath77 in the model as @xmath81 .",
    "+    .,title=\"fig:\"][fig : ch5,iw ]    in ref.@xcite , it was analysed in studying the freezing of qcd coupling effects that for running background coupling in @xmath82 scheme , one can choose @xmath83(eqn.30 of ref.@xcite ) and this value of @xmath84 does not contradict with those which are commonly used in @xmath85 renormalisation scheme and give rise to @xmath86 .",
