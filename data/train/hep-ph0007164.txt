    "there has been great interest in the study of semileptonic decays of heavy mesons as they provide a testing ground for heavy - quark effective theory ( hqet ) .",
    "the symmetry underlying this theory allows to derive model independent predictions for the form factors near the zero recoil point . on the other hand for heavy -to - light semileptonic transitions",
    ", there exists no symmetry principle to guide us .",
    "however , here the heavy quark expansion can be combined with chiral symmetry and pcac for final pseudoscalar mesons @xcite .",
    "we focus on @xmath6 which is important for the evaluation of the ckm matrix element @xmath7 .",
    "there have been many calculations @xcite for @xmath6 form factors , using different approches , in the past . in this paper",
    "we follow the approach used in ref .",
    "4 . in @xmath4 decay ,",
    "the vector meson pole @xmath8 , with mass degenerate with @xmath9 in the heavy quark symmetry limit , dominates the transition amplitude at the zero recoil point .",
    "we calculate the valence quark contribution , and find that it together with the equal - time contribution is as important as the @xmath3meson pole dominance of the form factors since the former two simulate a @xmath1meson pole like @xmath10 dependence of the form factors .",
    "we perform this calculation in a framework compatable with chiral symmetry and eliminate the @xmath9-meson bound state function in favor of @xmath9-meson decay constant @xmath11 which can likewise be calculated in the valance quark approximation .",
    "this procedure gives us form factors for @xmath12 in the range determined by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is some interaction scale , below which chiral symmetry should be valid .",
    "this constraint is then built into an extrapolation function for @xmath15 which determines @xmath16 in the entire @xmath2range .",
    "finally , we compare our results with some of the earlier calculations and also obtain an estimate of @xmath17 by using cleo data .",
    "the relevant hadronic matrix elements for the @xmath18 decay is defined as @xmath19 with @xmath20 the weak vector current @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "following ref .",
    "4 , the current algebra constraint at @xmath23 ( but not @xmath24 is @xmath25 where the tilde denotes that @xmath8 pole terms have been seperated out from @xmath26and from @xmath27 respectively , and @xmath28 the third term on the right hand side of eq.([2 ] ) comes from the equal time commutator .",

    "next we identify such corrections , as valence quark conribution to @xmath34 which we evaluate in the next section .",
    "the valence quark contribtion is shown in figure 1 .",

    "it is easy to see that the angular integration involving @xmath40 gives zero while that over @xmath60 gives @xmath61 so that in the rest frame of b - meson the angular integration involving @xmath62 gives @xmath63 . thus finally we obtian @xmath64   \\label{18}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 thus , writing @xmath66 we finally obtain the valence quark contribution to the form factors @xmath67 as @xmath68    to eliminate @xmath69 , we consider the matrix elements @xmath70 which , when evaluated in the same valence quark approximation employed for the calculation of @xmath71 , give @xmath72   \\label{23}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , using eqs.([11][13 ] , [ 15 ] ) and ( [ 23 ] ) , we obtain from eq.([20 ] , [ 21 ] ) @xmath73",

    "the eq.([n41 ] ) suggests that we may interpret the second factor in eq.([n41 ] ) as arising from a second pole at @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is some effective mass , so that @xmath115 and @xmath116 \\left ( 1-\\frac{m_b^2}{m_{b^{\\prime } } ^2}\\right )   \\label{n43}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is tempting to interpret that the suppression factor @xmath117 in eq.([n43 ] ) and the second pole in eq.([n41 ] ) as arising from radial excitations of @xmath8",

    "3 we give the comparison of our prediction for @xmath15 with @xmath127 gev and those of @xcite and @xcite as well as that of a recent calculation [ 32 ] where the @xmath128 transition form factors are obtained for the whole range of qsquare by using a different method of iterpolation between small and large values of @xmath10 .",

    "this constraint is then implimented through the extrapolation function for @xmath15 .",
    "the resulting form factor , valid for the entire physical range for @xmath10 , represents a softening of @xmath8 pole behavior and the supression of the chiral coupling which can be interpreted as being provided by the radial excitation of @xmath9 .",
    "the shape of the pion momentum distribution shown in figs",
    ". 4 and 5 should be able to distinguish our model from the others .",
    "the predicted branching ratio for @xmath18 in unit of @xmath129 is sensitive to the values of @xmath80 and @xmath11 as examplified in eq.([n45 ] ) , once we select the @xmath102 quark mass and the ratio @xmath145 we emphasize that uncertanities in the predicted branching ratio for @xmath146 are due to uncertainities in the external parameters @xmath80 and @xmath11 and are not intrinsic to the model .    with the cleo measurement of the branching ratio for @xmath18 , our prediction ( [ n44 ] ) with @xmath125 and @xmath124 gev",
