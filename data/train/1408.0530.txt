    "following the shut - down of the hera collider at desy ( hamburg ) , exclusive diffractive production of vector mesons in ultra - peripheral collisions of protons and nuclei became among the priorities of the present and future studies at the cern lhc @xcite , triggering a large number of theoretical investigations @xcite .",
    "for a relevant review paper see , e.g. , ref .",
    "first results on vector meson production ( vmp ) , in particular on @xmath0 , are already published @xcite .    in this study of vmp at the cern lhc we scrutinize possible changes in the energy dependence of the cross sections when moving from hera to the lhc , in particular we are interested in the change from light vector mesons to heavy vector mesons ( @xmath11 , _ etc . _ ) .",
    "at hera , vmp was studied in details both by the h1 and zeus collaborations .",
    "most of the events were chosen in the kinematical region corresponding to diffractive scattering , which means that the processes can be described by a pomeron exchange ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] ) .",
    "pomeron dominance is especially clean in @xmath12 production , where , by the zweig ( ozi ) rule , any exchange of secondary trajectories , made of quarks , is forbidden , thus leaving alone the uncontaminated pomeron exchange .",
    "this does not mean that the dynamics is simple , but we have the opportunity to study in this class of reactions the nature of the pomeron , a complicated and controversial object .",
    "the main problem is the twin nature of the pomeron : it seems to be  soft \" or ",
    "hard \" depending on the virtuality of the incident photon and/or the mass of the produced vector meson .",
    "in most of the papers on the subject the existence of two pomerons is assumed : a hard ( or qcd ) pomeron , resulting from perturbative quantum chromodynamic calculations , and a soft one , somewhat misleadingly called  non - perturbative \" .",
    "we instead believe that there is only one pomeron in nature , but it has two components , whose relative weight is regulated by relevant @xmath13-dependent factors in front of the two , where the measure of the  hardness \" , @xmath14 , is the sum of the squared photon virtuality @xmath15 and the squared mass @xmath16 of the produced vector meson .    a specific model realizing this idea was constructed and tested against the experimental data recently ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and earlier references therein ) .",
    "the relevant vmp amplitude reads @xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the soft and hard pomeron trajectories , @xmath21 , @xmath22 being the energy of the vmp .",
    "let us stress that the pomeron is unique in all reactions , but its components ( and parameters ) vary . examples with detailed fits can be found in the papers of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the integrated ( called also total ) vmp cross section is given by @xmath23 where the upper limit is @xmath24 gev@xmath25 and the lower limit is the kinematical one , @xmath26 .",
    "the total cross section can be simply calculated , without integration for an exponential diffraction cone , according to the formula @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the forward slope .    since",
    "our primary goal is the comparison between the energy dependence of vmp at hera and the lhc , we start with very simple anstz for the @xmath29 cross section , postponing the use of the advanced model given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : amplitude_ffjs ] ) to a future study .",
    "vector meson production ( vmp ) cross section in hadronic collisions ( see the relative feynman diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : vmp_feynman ] ) can be written in a factorized form , according to refs .",
    "@xcite ( e.g. eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 9 ) in @xcitea ) ) .",
    "the distribution in the rapidity @xmath30 of the production of a vector meson @xmath31 in the reaction @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 may be a hadron , e.g. proton , or a nucleus , ppb , pbpb , ... ) is calculated according to a standard prescription based on the factorization of the photon flux and photon - proton cross section ( see below ) .",
    "generally speaking , the @xmath34 differential cross section depends on three variables : the total energy of the @xmath34 system , @xmath22 , the squared momentum transfer at the proton vertex , @xmath35 , and @xmath14 , where , as previously said , @xmath15 is the photon virtuality and @xmath36 is the mass of the produced vector meson . since , by definition , in ultra - peripheral collisions we have @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the impact parameter , i.e. the closest distance between the centres of the colliding particles / nuclei with radii @xmath39 ( i = 1,2 ) , photons are nearly real , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 remains the only measure of  hardness \" .",
    "notice that this might not be true for peripheral collisions , where @xmath42 , and in the pomeron or odderon exchange instead of the photon .",
    "finally , the @xmath35-dependence ( shape of the diffraction cone ) is known to be nearly exponential .",
    "it can be either integrated , or kept explicit . extending this parametrization to include a @xmath43dependent exponential",
    "is easy ( see below ) .",
    "concerning total cross section @xmath44 , it is well known from hera .",
    "we use a simple parametrization of the @xmath45 cross section , suggested by donnachie and landshoff @xcite : @xmath46 ( more involved models , e.g. of ref .",
    "@xcite will be considered elsewhere ) .",
    "the differential cross section as function of the rapidity @xmath30 reads @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the  equivalent \" photon flux @xcite , defined as ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) @xmath50 ( \\ln\\omega-\\frac{11}{6}+\\frac{3}{\\omega}-\\frac{3}{2\\omega^2}+\\frac{1}{3\\omega^3 } ) , \\label{photon_flux}\\ ] ] and @xmath51 is the total cross section of the vector meson photoproduction subprocess ( the same as e.g. at hera , see ref .",

    "furthermore , @xmath60 with @xmath61 and @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "the differential cross section in @xmath22 can be calculated as @xmath64 .",
    "for definiteness we fix : a ) the colliding particles are protons ; b ) the produced vector meson @xmath31 is @xmath0 , and 3 ) the collision energy @xmath65 tev .",
    "we comprise the constants in @xmath66 .",
    "( note that the shape of the distribution in @xmath30 is very sensitive to the value and the sign of the constant @xmath67 ) .",
    "the @xmath68 signs of @xmath52 correspond to the first or second term in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , respectively , @xmath69 .      the above results may be modified by initial and final state interactions , alternatively called as rescattering corrections .",
    "the calculation of these corrections is by far not unambiguous , the result depending both on the input and on the unitarization procedure chosen .",
    "the better ( more realistic ) the input , the smaller the unitarity ( rapidity gap survival probability ) corrections .",
    "since this is a complicated and controversial issue _ per se _ deserving special studies beyond the scope of the present paper , to be coherent with the  common trend \" , here we use only familiar results from the literature : the standard prescription is to multiply the scattering amplitude ( or the cross section ) by a factor ( smaller than one ) , depending on the energy and eventually other kinematical variables  @xcite . in this work we used the constant value of 0.8 .",
    "in this section theoretical predictions are presented and compared to experimental data . in our alculations",
    "we use two models for the exclusive @xmath12 photoproduction cross section , @xmath70 : the simple power - law , @xmath71 , with @xmath72 , and the so - called reggeometric model .",
    "the latter , in its first version , was suggested and applied to deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) in ref .",
    "apart from @xmath22 and @xmath35 , it contains also the dependence on virtuality , @xmath15 .",
    "the model was fitted to the hera data on dvcs , but it can be applied also to the vmp by refitting its parameters . in this paper",
    "we use the first ( simpler ) version of the reggeometric model of vmp and dvcs , suggested in ref .",

    "[ fig : dsigma_dy_nodata ] shows the predicted differential cross section of @xmath12 production at lhc ( @xmath65 tev ) as a distribution in rapidity @xmath30 . on the whole , the power law and the reggeometric model yield similar distributions ,",
