    "the evolution of the luminosity function ( lf ) is a fundamental probe for cosmological theories of galaxy formation .",
    "indeed , the red and blue / uv luminosities are related to the galaxy stellar mass and star formation rate , respectively .",
    "thus the evolution of the lf reflects the differential contribution of different galaxy types to the cosmic history of mass growth and of star formation which are the main outcomes of hierarchical models for galaxy formation .    adopting a schechter fit to the lf , recent estimates ( zucca et al .",
    "1997 , marzke & da costa 1997 , folkes et al .",
    "1999 ) point toward a relatively steep power law at the faint end ( with a power index @xmath6 ) , although an excess of dwarf blue galaxies relative to the schechter fit is found at the faint end .    in the intermediate redshift range ( up to @xmath7 ) , first steps toward the evaluation of the lf evolution were undertaken by the canada france redshift survey ( cfrs , lilly et al .",
    "1995 ) and by the autofib redshift survey ( ellis et al .",
    "1996 , heyl et al .",
    "these surveys have shown some increase in the number density of the fainter population together with some increase in the luminosity of the brighter blue fraction .",
    "these two effects are responsible for the strong increase with @xmath8 of the average cosmic uv luminosity density ( by a factor 510 ) in the redshift interval @xmath9 .    deep multicolor surveys of galaxies represent an effective way to explore the galaxy distribution in the redshift interval @xmath10 .",
    "successful spectroscopic confirmation was obtained for the brightest fraction by steidel et al .",
    "( 1996,1999 ) . for the bulk of the population reliable photometric redshifts",
    "are currently used ( e.g. connolly et al .",
    "1997 ; giallongo et al .",
    "1998 , fernandez - soto , lanzetta & yahil 1999 ; fontana et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the average uv luminosity density resulting from these studies shows a flat distribution at @xmath11 that extends up to @xmath12 .",
    "such a result represents a strong constraint to hierarchical galaxy formation theories that predict a significant contribution by a large population of small objects . in a previous paper we showed that when the effects of the sample magnitude limits are included in the models , a steadly decline in the predicted uv luminosity density appears in contrast with the observed behavior ( fontana et al . 1999 )",
    ".    attempts to clarify the contribution of different ( in mass and sfr ) galaxy populations to the global uv luminosity density , requires an evaluation of the high redshift lf down to the faintest accessible magnitudes . in this letter",
    "we present a first estimate of the intermediate / high-@xmath8 luminosity function using a composite deep multicolor sample of about 1200 galaxies with reliable photometric redshifts down to @xmath13 .",
    "the depth of this data sample , together with its relatively large area , allows a direct comparison of the observed lf shape and evolution with theoretical predictions .",
    "such comparison is performed using a semianalytic implementation of recent hierarchical models of galaxy formation .",
    "the analyzed dataset covers a wavelength range from the uv to the k bands , and observations were taken from ground based telescopes and from the hst as well .",
    "the first field , known as new technology telescope deep field ( nttdf ) consists of an area of @xmath14 arcmin@xmath15 where optical and near - ir ubvrijk observations have been taken at the eso ntt telescope with various instrumentation ( susi , susi-2 , sofi ) .",
    "further details about the multicolor catalog can be found in arnouts et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and in fontana et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "we have also used the hubble deep fields north and south catalogs provided by fernandez - soto et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , with an overall area of @xmath16 arcmin@xmath15 and 4.22 arcmin@xmath15 respectively . after appropriate selections to remove contamination by stars and low signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) regions",
    ", we applied our photometric redshift code to the data down to @xmath13 .",
    "a detailed description of this procedure , along with photometric @xmath8 catalogs , can be found in fontana et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "in addition , in the present evaluation of the luminosity function , we have also considered one of the main systematic errors affecting the estimates of the galaxy total absolute magnitudes at various @xmath8 , which is the surface brightness cosmological dimming effect . to correct for this effect one has to recover the total galaxy emitted flux . to estimate the systematic losses associated with any recovering procedure , we performed simulations of synthetic galaxies ( having exponential intensity profiles with an ellipticity of 0.5 ) with different apparent magnitudes , as seen with the appropriate s / n in the hdf images",
    ". then we compared the total input flux with the one obtained by extrapolating the intensity profiles as computed in the setractor package ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "the simulations show that the difference @xmath17 between the input and the measured apparent magnitudes increases from 0.1 to 0.25 when the input magnitude increases from @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "for these reasons , although the catalogs in the hdfs go deeper , we will confine the analysis of the lf at magnitudes @xmath20 in the hdfs ( and 25.7 in the nttdf ) where errors in the estimate of the total magnitudes are small and do not affect our main results on the shape of the lf .",
    "several methods are available in the literature ( see efstathiou , ellis & peterson 1988 for a discussion ) : here we choose to adopt the classical @xmath21 estimator ( schmidt 1968 ) jointly with the sandage , tammann & yahil ( 1979 ) maximum likelihood fit for a schechter function . in the @xmath21 method , for any given redshift bin ( @xmath22 ) an effective maximum volume is assigned to each object .",
    "this volume is enclosed between @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the latter being defined as the minimum between @xmath25 and the maximum redshift at which the object could have been observed given the magnitude limit of the sample .",
    "combining data from separate fields with different magnitude limits , we then compute the galaxy number density @xmath26 in every @xmath27 bin as follows :    @xmath28^{-1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath29 is the area in units of steradians corresponding to the field @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the total number of objects in the chosen bin .",
    "the number of fields involved in the sum over index j is restricted to the ones with a faint enough magnitude limit for the i - th object to be detected . in this way",
    "each galaxy has a different @xmath32 in every field and the overall volume available for this object is obtained summing the corresponding @xmath33 .",
    "on the other hand the sty technique , once assumed a schechter behaviour for the lf , is an endeavour to maximize the likelihood of representing the observed set of galaxies with the best fit parameters of the schechter function . assuming that , in an appropriately thin bin of redshift , the number of sources with redshift between @xmath8 and @xmath34 , and with absolute magnitude between @xmath35 and @xmath36 can be factorized as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the density of galaxies at redshift @xmath8 , that can be considered constant within the bin .",
    "the function @xmath39 is taken to have a schechter form , parametrized by the characteristic absolute magnitude @xmath40 , by the logarithmic slope at the faint end @xmath41 and by the normalization @xmath42 .",
    "if we choose an appropriate redshift bin @xmath43 , it is possible to give an estimation of @xmath41 and @xmath44 considering the probability density @xmath45 to find a galaxy with redshift in the range @xmath46 and absolute magnitude between @xmath47 and @xmath48 in the j - th magnitude - limited field and maximizing the likelihood of observing the set of galaxies that comes from the surveys , wich is simply given by the product of the single probabilities : @xmath49 @xmath29 beeing the field area in steradians , and @xmath50 the absolute magnitude value that the i - th object , if detected with the magnitude limit @xmath51 in the j - th survey , should have at that redshift .",
    "this value clearly depends on the details of the spectrum of each object . here",
    "j runs over the number of fields where the i - th galaxy can be detected , each one containing @xmath52 objects .    the value of @xmath53 is then obtained summing the density in the @xmath54 space for every galaxy , taking account of all the fields where it could be detected ( i.e. the fields with enough bright magnitude limit ) : @xmath55^{-1}\\ ] ] as for an appropriate selection in magnitude of the sample , it is important to bear in mind that once a rest frame wavelength @xmath56 is chosen ( e.g. the @xmath57  band ) , this corresponds to different observed wavelengths @xmath58 when @xmath8 runs inside the redshift bin @xmath43 . since our aim is to choose appropriately a complete subsample selected in the rest - frame , we ought to take into account the different redshifts of each galaxy and the details of the spectra as well , to be sure that we are selecting objects in a coherent way .",
    "one major concern is fixing the bins in redshift in a suitable way for matching the observed bands once the wavelength displacement is taken into account .",
    "subsequentely the right selection criterion can be achieved by comparing the photometric limit with the @xmath58 magnitude value taken from the spectrum .",
    "this implies a limiting magnitude @xmath59 at a wavelength of @xmath60  for @xmath61 and @xmath62 at @xmath63  for @xmath64 in the hdfs .",

    "the rest frame b magnitude is computed from the best fit theoretical spectral energy distribution used to derive the photometric redshift .",
    "the magnitude limit of the sample has been evaluated at the same rest - frame wavelength centered in the rest frame b band , which roughly corresponds to the observed v , r , i bands for the three redshift bins , respectively .",

    "the best fit values of the schechter parameters obtained from the maximum likelihood method are summarized in table 1 together with the relevant sample parameters for both the considered cosmologies . in the highest redshift bin ( @xmath74 )",

    "the schechter curves corresponding to the tabulated fitting parameters are shown in figs .",

    "in particular , the schechter lfs from the canada france redshift survey and the autofib survey are also shown for @xmath75 as dotted and dashed curves , respectively .",
    "an overall agreement with the spectroscopic data is evident at bright magnitudes , supporting the reliability of our lf photometric estimation .",
    "the variance between spectroscopic surveys could be due to different k - corrections applied for the estimate of the rest - frame blue magnitudes from samples selected in different bands .",
    "as discussed in sawicki et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , the uncertainties in the photometric redshift estimates do not affect appreciably the behavior of the lf : suitable monte carlo simulations have shown that perturbations arising from redshift uncertanties result in effects smaller than one sigma error bars in the @xmath21 estimator and in small changes in the best - fit schechter parameters . in our case the good match with cfrs leaves little space for this kind of substantial changes in the distribution .",
    "it can be seen that from @xmath76 up to @xmath77 , there is no evidence of a significant trend with redshift in the faint - end slope parameter @xmath41 , which remains close to its local value @xmath78 ( zucca et al . 1997 ) .",
    "also , the characteristic magnitude @xmath79 shows a mild brightening with the look - back time.at high redshifts a steepening effect is evident in the @xmath1 lf ( fig.2 , left panel ) , where the slope parameter reaches a value of @xmath80 , consistent within uncertainties with the @xmath81 found by steidel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) in an analogous redshift bin .",
    "we note however that in this high redshift bin the slope is weakly constrained by the present depth of the galaxy sample .",
    "we compare our data with our rendition of the semianalytic models .",
    "the structure of such rendition is described in poli et al .",
    "we updated our model to implement some of the most recent improvements inserted in the recent versions of semianalytic models , following the lines of cole et al .",
    "in particular we now adopt the lacey & cole ( 1993 ) dynamical friction timescale , the new star formation and feedback recipes and the new modelization for hot gas distribution implemented by the above authors .",
    "this allows us to obtain a tully - fisher relation in reasonable agreement with observations together with a good fit to the local luminosity function , the two observables that have been used to calibrate the free parameters governing the star formation and the feedback processes .",
    "in addition we have included dust absorption , which is modelled as in poli et al .",
    "we have checked that the predictions of our model agree with those from cole et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for both the local observables and the global cosmic star formation history .              to compare with the data we focus on the flat @xmath87cdm ( cold dark matter ) cosmology .",
    "such choice is favoured by a significant amount of recent observational results , from the high - fraction of the baryons - to - dm ratio in galaxy clusters ( see , e.g. , white & fabian 1995 ) to the high - redshift sne ( see perlmutter et al .",
    "when inserted into galaxy formation models , the above set of parameters also yields a cosmic star formation history in reasonable agreement with observations ( see fontana et al .",
    "1999 ) , in contrast , e.g. , with the standard cdm with @xmath66 and @xmath88 .",
    "fig.1 and fig .",
    "2 ( right panels ) show a comparison of the observed luminosity functions derived from our composite sample and our cdm model .",
    "first we note a general agreement for @xmath89 and @xmath3 .",
    "both data and predictions show weak luminosity evolution resulting from a balance between a mild decrease with @xmath8 of the number of massive objects and the increase of their star formation activity and hence of their blue luminosity . at the same time , the normalization of the lf rises by a factor of @xmath90 .    at low luminosities",
    "the theoretical lf appears steeper than the observed one , with an excess at the faint end that becomes larger with increasing redshift .",
    "in addition , at @xmath91 the model tends to slightly underestimate the magnitudes of bright galaxies when the model with larger dust extinction ( @xmath92 mag , in agreement with pettini et al .",
    "1998 ) is considered .",
    "such results show that a refinement of the models is required , both in terms of dynamical processes ( like merging of satellites in common halos , see somerville , primack , & faber 2001 ) and in terms of stellar processes ( like the feedback from supernovae , appreciably affecting the lf at the faint - end ) . indeed , the apparent agreement of the predicted vs. observed uv luminosity density at @xmath93 ( fontana et al .",
    "1999 ) results from the balance in the lf between the excess of the predicted dwarfs and the deficit of predicted bright galaxies , as shown in the right panels of fig .",
    "this shows that the @xmath8-resolved lfs constitute a particulary powerful way of constraining the two most uncertain processes in the theoretical modelling , i.e. , the dust absorption affecting the prediction of the number of bright galaxies and the supernovae feedback affecting the slope of the predicted lf at the faint end .",
    "the above considerations suggest that the comparison of the observed and predicted uv luminosity density at @xmath94 is critical at the bright end .",
    "indeed , the details of the dust extinction are important at the bright end of the steep lf function since the dust extinction affects not only the observed uv luminosities but also the number of galaxies that are detected within the magnitude limit . some spectroscopic information for the brightest sources can better constrain the dust content at these high @xmath8 .    for such a reason , the comparison between the predicted and observed uv luminosity densities should be performed over wider areas of the sky , to reduce fluctuations in the number of bright sources , and using different limiting magnitudes , extended to the faintest limits , to explore the dust content as a function of the galaxy star formation rate and mass .",
    "this will allow us to sample the shape of the lf at the faint end , which is crucial to assess whether complementary physical processes have to be included in the current hierarchical models ."
