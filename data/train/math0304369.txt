    "this follows from girsanov s theorem ( see , e .. g , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem i.6.4 ) ) that states roughly that brownian motions with the same variance but different drifts give rise to absolutely continuous measures on paths .",

    "it is not hard to show that this quantity is closely related to @xmath125 $ ] .",
    "if we differentiate ( [ lde.chord ] ) with respect to @xmath24 we get an equation for @xmath126 , and standard techniques of stochastic calculus can be applied to give a differential equation for the function @xmath127 $ ] .",
    "we get an exact solution in terms of hypergeometric functions ( * ? ? ?",

    "-5 mm        as already mentioned , computation of dimensions for many exceptional sets for brownian motion reduces to finding the brownian intersection exponents .",
    "these exponents , which can be defined in terms of crossing probabilities for non - intersecting paths , were studied in @xcite . in these papers , relations were given between different exponents and a `` universality '' principle was shown for conformally invariant processes satisfying an additional hypothesis ( the term completely conformally invariant was used there ) .",
    "heuristic arguments indicated that self - avoiding walks and percolation should also satisfy this hypothesis .",
    "unfortunately , from a rigorous standpoint , we had only reduced a hard problem , computing the brownian intersection exponents , to the even harder problem of showing conformal invariance and computing the exponents for self - avoiding walks or critical percolation .    at the same time schramm @xcite was completing his beautiful construction of @xmath42 and conjecturing that @xmath99 gave the boundaries of critical percolation clusters .",
    "while he was unable to prove that critical percolation has a conformally invariant limit , he was able to conclude that if the limit was conformally invariant then it must be @xmath99 .",
    "the identification @xmath98 was determined from rigorous `` crossing probabilities '' for @xmath42 ; only @xmath97 was consistent with cardy s formula ( see  [ percsec ] ) or even the simple fact that a square should have crossing probability @xmath130 .",
    "since both brownian motion and @xmath99 were conjectured to be related to the scaling limit of critical percolation , it was natural to try to use @xmath99 to prove results about brownian motion ( and , as mentioned before , the hausdorff dimension of exceptional sets on the path ) ; see @xcite .",
    "there were two major parts of the proof .",
    "first , the locality property for @xmath99 was formulated and proved ; this allowed ideas as in @xcite to show that the exponents of @xmath99 can be used to find the exponents for brownian motion .",
    "second , the exponents for @xmath99 had to be computed .",
    "the basic idea is discussed at the end of the last section .",
    "what makes @xmath1 so powerful is that it reduces problems about a two - dimensional process to analysis of a one - dimensional stochastic differential equation ( and hence a partial differential equation in one space variable ) .",
    "the universality in these papers was in terms of exponents .",
    "we now know that the paths of planar brownian motion and @xmath99 are even more closely related .",
    "the `` hull '' generated by an @xmath99 is the same as the hull generated by a brownian motion with oblique reflection ( see @xcite ) . in particular",
    ", the frontiers ( outer boundaries ) of the two processes have the same dimension .",
    "there are now direct proofs that the hausdorff dimension of the frontier of @xmath99 is @xmath0 ( @xcite ) and this stronger universality principle implies the same holds for brownian paths .",
    "suppose each vertex of the planar triangular lattice is colored independently white or black , with the probability of a white being @xmath130 .",
    "this is called _ critical percolation _ ( on the triangular lattice ) .",
    "let @xmath131 be a simply connected domain in @xmath132 and let @xmath133 be disjoint nontrivial connected arcs on @xmath134 .",
    "consider the limit as @xmath135 of the probability that in critical percolation on a lattice with mesh size @xmath136 that there is a connected set of white vertices in @xmath131 connecting @xmath137 .",
    "it has long been believed that this limit , @xmath138 , exists and is strictly between @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "( note : if the probability of a white vertex is @xmath141 , then @xmath138 is @xmath139 for @xmath142 and @xmath140 for @xmath143 .",
    "one of the features of _ critical _ percolation is the fact that this quantity is strictly between @xmath139 and @xmath140 . ) moreover , it has been conjectured that @xmath138 is a conformal invariant @xcite .",
    "it is also believed that this limit does not depend on the nature of the lattice ; for example , critical bond percolation in @xmath144 ( each bond is colored white or black independently with probability @xmath130 ) should give the same limit .",
    "cardy @xcite used nonrigorous methods from conformal field theory to find an exact formula for @xmath138 ; his calculations were done for @xmath145 and the formula involves hypergeometric functions .",
    "carleson noted that the formula was much nicer if one chooses @xmath131 to be an equilateral triangle of side length @xmath140 ; @xmath146 , one of the sides ; and @xmath147 , a line segment of length @xmath148 with one endpoint on the vertex opposite @xmath146 . in this case ,",
    "cardy s formula is @xmath149 .",
    "schramm @xcite went further and , _ assuming existence and conformal invariance of the limit _ , showed that the limiting boundary between black and white clusters can be given in terms of @xmath99 .",
    "if @xmath150 denotes the third side of the triangle ( so that @xmath151 is a single point ) , we can consider the limiting cluster formed by taking all the white vertices that are connected by a path of white vertices to @xmath150 . in the limit",
    ", the outer boundary of this `` hull '' has the same distribution as the outer boundary of the hull of chordal @xmath99 going from the vertex @xmath152 to the vertex @xmath151 .",
    "the identification with @xmath1 comes from the conformal invariance assumption ; schramm determined the value @xmath97 from a particular crossing probability , but we now understand this in terms of the locality property which scaling limits of these boundary curves can be seen to satisfy .",
    "cardy s formula ( and generalizations ) were computed for @xmath42 in @xcite .",
    "recently smirnov @xcite made a major breakthrough by proving conformal invariance and cardy s formula for the limit of critical percolation in the triangular lattice .",
    "as a corollary , the identification of the limit with @xmath99 has become a theorem .",
    "this has also led to rigorous proofs of a number of critical exponents for the lattice model @xcite .",
    "the basic strategy is to compute the exponent for @xmath99 and to then to use smirnov s result to relate this exponent to lattice percolation .",
    "_ loop - erased random walk ( lerw ) _ in a finite set @xmath153 starting at @xmath154 is the measure on self - avoiding paths obtained from starting a simple random walk at the origin , stopping at the first time that it leaves @xmath73 , and erasing loops chronologically from the path .",
    "it can also be defined as a nonmarkov chain which at each time @xmath155 chooses a new step using probabilities weighted by the probability that simple random walk starting at the new point avoids the path up to that point ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is also related to uniform spanning trees ; if one choose a spanning tree uniformly among all spanning trees of @xmath73 , considered as a graph with appropriate boundary conditions , then the distribution of the unique self - avoiding path from the origin to the boundary is the same as lerw .",
    "wilson gave a beautiful algorithm to generate uniform spanning trees using lerw @xcite .",
    "one can hope to define a scaling limit of planar lerw on a domain connecting an interior point to a boundary point by taking lerw on finer and finer grids and taking the limit .",
    "there are a number of reasons to believe that this limit is conformally invariant .",
    "for example .",
    "the limit of simple random walk ( brownian motion ) is conformally invariant and the ordering of points used in the loop - erasing procedure is not changed under conformal maps .",
    "also , certain crossing probabilities for lerw can be given by determinants of probabilities for simple random walk ( see @xcite ) , and hence these quantities are conformally invariant .",
    "kenyon @xcite used a conformal invariance argument ( using a determinant relation from a related domino tiling model ) to prove that the growth exponent for lerw is @xmath156 ; roughly , this says it takes about @xmath157 steps for a lerw to travel distance @xmath158 .",
    "schramm @xcite showed that under the assumption of conformal invariance , the scaling limit of lerw must be radial @xmath159 .",
    "he used conformal invariance and a natural markovian - type property of lerw to conclude that it must be an @xmath42 , and then he used kenyon s result to determine @xmath41 .",
    "recently , schramm , werner , and i @xcite proved that the scaling limit of loop - erased random walk is @xmath160 .",
    "there is another path obtained from the uniform spanning tree that has been called the uniform spanning tree peano curve .",
    "this path , which lies on the dual lattice , encodes the entire tree ( not just the path from the origin to the boundary ) . a similar ,",
    "although somewhat more involved , argument can be used to show that this process converges to the space - filling curve @xmath161 @xcite .        a _ self - avoiding walk ( saw )",
    "_ in the lattice @xmath144 is a nearest neighbor walk with no self - intersections .",
    "the problem of the saw is to understand the uniform measure on all such walks of a given length ( or sometimes the measure that assigns weight @xmath162 to all walks of length @xmath155 ) .",
    "it is still an open problem to prove there is a limiting distribution ; it is believed that such a limit in conformally invariant ( see @xcite for precise statements ) . however ,",
    "if the conjectures hold there is only one possible limit , @xmath163 .",
    "the conformal invariance property leads one to conclude that the limit must be an @xmath42 and @xmath164 is needed in order to have a measure on simple paths .",
    "the property that @xmath163 has that is not held by @xmath42 for other @xmath165 is the _ restriction property_. the restriction property is similar to , but not the same , as the locality property .",
    "let @xmath73 be a compact subset and @xmath77 the transformation as in  [ section 2 ] then @xcite if @xmath166 is an @xmath163 path from @xmath139 to @xmath167 , the distribution of @xmath168 given the event @xmath169 is the same as ( a time change of ) @xmath163 .",
    "in fact , the probability that @xmath169 is @xmath170 .",
    "if the scaling limit of saw has a conformally invariant limit then one can show easily that the limit satisfies the restriction property .",
    "hence , the only candidate for the limit ( assuming a conformally invariant scaling limit ) is @xmath163 .",
    "the conjectures for critical exponents for saw can be interpreted in terms of rigorous properties of @xmath163 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for example , the hausdorff dimension of @xmath163 paths is @xmath0 @xcite ; this gives strong evidence that the limit of saws should give paths of dimension @xmath0 .",
