    "the noisy wiretap channel was first studied by wyner @xcite , in which a legitimate transmitter ( alice ) wishes to send a message to a legitimate receiver ( bob ) , and hide it from an eavesdropper ( eve ) .",
    "wyner proved that alice can send positive secure rate using channel coding .",
    "he derived capacity - equivocation region for the degraded wiretap channel .",
    "later , csiszar and korner found capacity - equivocation the region for the general wiretap channel @xcite , which was extended to the gaussian wiretap channel by leung - yan- cheong and hellman @xcite .",
    "a significant amount of work was carried thereafter to study the information theoretic physical layer security for different network models .",
    "the relay assisted wiretap channel was studied in @xcite .",
    "the secure degrees of freedom ( sdof ) region of multiple access channel ( mac ) was presented in @xcite .",
    "the sdof is the the pre - log of the secrecy capacity region in the high - snr regime .",
    "using mimo systems for securing the message was an intuitive extension due to the spatial gain provided by multiple antennas .",
    "the mimo wiretap channel was studied in @xcite and the secrecy capacity was identified in @xcite .    all the aforementioned work assumes availability of either partial or complete channel state information ( csi ) at the transmitter .",
    "given that the eavesdropper is passive , it is of high importance to study the case where the channel state information is completely unknown to the legitimate users .",
    "the authors in@xcite study the secrecy capacity and sdof for different mimo channels when the eavesdropper channel is arbitrarily varying and known to the eavesdropper only . in  @xcite the authors established the sdof region for a scenario comprising a single eavesdropper assuming a square full - rank legitimate channel matrix ( i.e. has zero null space ) .",
    "meanwhile , in @xcite the authors addressed the sdof of the mac assuming a single eavesdropper where all the transmitted symbols are intended for the legitimate receiver ( no exploitation of jamming ) .",
    "meanwhile , the idea of cooperative jamming was proposed in @xcite , where some of the users transmit independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "gaussian noise towards the eavesdropper to improve the sum secrecy rate .",
    "cooperative jamming was used for deriving the sdof for different networks . in @xcite ,",
    "cooperative jamming was used to jam the eavesdropper and proved that the k - user mac with single antenna nodes can achieve @xmath2 sdof .    in this paper",
    ", we study the mimo mac with unknown eavesdroppers csi at the legitimate transmitters and receiver .",
    "we provide a new upperbound for the achievable sdof and determine the exact sum sdof by providing an achievable scheme .",
    "we show that our scheme is optimal and that the achievable bound and the new upperbound are tight .",
    "our scheme requires neither cooperation between the legitimate transmitters nor cooperation between any legitimate transmitter and the legitimate receiver , and precoding matrices and the jamming vectors are determined in distributed manner .",
    "the major contributions of our work as compared to existing literature can be summarized as follows :    * we present the sum sdof of the multiple access channel with unknown fading eavesdroppers channels .",
    "* for the case of known eavesdropper channels with constant or time varying channels , we show that it has the same sum sdof as the previous case , closing an open problem since the best known achievable region was presented in @xcite . * our work incorporates the more general scenario of multiple eavesdroppers .",
    "* we assume no restrictions on the relation between the number of antennas at transmitters and the receiver .",
    "* we study the more comprehensive case where all the eigenvalues of the legitimate channel has non - zero values . *",
    "we deduce a new upperbound on the sdof . *",
    "we provide a scheme that achieves the new upperbound .",
    "for the special case of a single eavesdropper , our proposed scheme achieves a sum sdof superior to those reported in the literature .",
