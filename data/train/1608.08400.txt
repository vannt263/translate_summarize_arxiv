    "the idea of studying `` network motifs '' in biological systems , namely simple , frequently occurring , structures from which some properties of the system may be inferred , has attracted considerable recent interest ( for example @xcite ) . the reason is quite natural : systems biology proceeds dually by elucidating the functioning of subsystems while at the same time attempting to fit together these pieces to explain large - scale behaviours in biological systems . at the heart of this study is a need to know how behaviours in a dynamical system are affected by embedding this system in some larger system in well - defined ways .",
    "some rigorous results in this area come from the literature on hyperbolicity and structural stability ( @xcite , for example ) , and on monotone control systems ( @xcite , for example ) .",
    "a closely related type of question is when a behaviour known to occur in some member of a _ family _ of dynamical systems @xmath0 can be guaranteed to occur in some member of a new family @xmath1 related to @xmath0 in some natural sense .",
    "our goal here is understanding the inheritance of _ multiple positive nondegenerate equilibria _",
    "( mpne , definition  [ defmpne ] below ) and _ multiple positive linearly stable equilibria _ ( mpse , definition  [ defmpse ] below ) in chemical reaction networks ( crns ) which form the main component of most biological models .",
    "the literature on multiple equilibria in crns is extensive and we do not attempt to provide a bibliography ; the recent papers @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite provide some references to key strands of this work . but most work , including our own , has focussed on conditions for _ precluding _ multistationarity ; in some ways the opposite of the question treated here .",
    "an exception is the paper by joshi and shiu @xcite , which inspired this paper .",
    "the authors treated questions of inheritance of multistationarity primarily , but not exclusively , focussed on _ fully open _ crns ( definition  [ deffullyopen ] below ) .",
    "they highlighted that in studying multistationarity ( and potentially other nontrivial behaviours in crns ) , we need to identify a relevant partial order on the set of all crns , and then search for minimal elements w.r.t .",
    "this partial order , which they termed _",
    "atoms_. this partial order @xmath2 should be such that if some crn @xmath3 displays the behaviour of interest , and @xmath4 , then @xmath5 must display this behaviour . in the context of multistationarity in fully open crns , and with certain kinetic assumptions , there is a nice result : if we identify crns with their natural digraphs ( see definition  [ defpetrinet ] below ) , then mpne and mpse are inherited in the induced subnetwork partial order ( see definition  [ defiso ] ) .",
    "this result ( corollary  [ coropeninduced ] below ) was largely known to joshi and shiu ( corollary  4.6 of @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the results here allow considerably stronger claims about the inheritance of mpne and mpse in fully open networks ( see remark  [ remfobest ] ) .    results about fully open crns do not generalise easily to arbitrary crns : a crn which forbids multistationarity may have induced subnetworks which permit multistationarity . building larger crns from smaller ones in natural ways such as adding reactions can quite generally both introduce and destroy multistationarity .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to formulate several operations which together define a partial order @xmath6 on crns such that if @xmath3 displays mpne ( resp . ,",
    "mpse ) and @xmath7 then @xmath5 displays mpne ( resp . ,",
    "mpse ) , and it is this task which we _ begin _ in this paper . for example , we can add new reactions involving new species while preserving mpne and mpse provided certain conditions are met ( theorem  [ thmblockadd ] ) . feliu and wiuf @xcite show that under various circumstances multistationarity survives when a reaction is `` split '' with the introduction of a new intermediate species .",
    "we have a result involving splitting reactions and inserting intermediate complexes ( theorem  [ thmintermediates ] ) which reproduces and generalises some elements of their results .",
    "availability of a partial order relevant to mpne or mpse couples naturally with the task of characterising minimal networks admitting these behaviours w.r.t . this partial order .",
    "although minimal networks need not be small , in the sense of having few species , few reactions , or limited numbers of molecules participating in each reaction , a first step is naturally to identify _ small _ minimal subnetworks with the desired behaviour .",
    "we do not undertake this task here , but it was begun for the induced subnetwork partial order in @xcite and continued in the recent preprint @xcite .    our proofs all follow roughly the same template , relying heavily on the implicit function theorem , with some insight from differential topology .",
    "we do not need to appeal to degree theory @xcite , or homotopy theory @xcite , or any nontrivial algebra , even though many of the resulting claims are algebraic in the sense of being about the zeros of polynomial equations .",
    "our local approach , though powerful , necessarily has limitations discussed in remark  [ remlimit ] and the conclusions .",
    "the paper is laid out as follows . after introducing some basic notions in section  [ secbackground ] we present an extended example ( section  [ secextended ] ) beginning with a crn which displays mpne and illustrating some of the many ways one might `` build up '' a reaction network , some of which will be proved to preserve mpne and some of which destroy it .",
    "this foreshadows the theorems to follow , while also highlighting their limitations .",
    "we then present in section  [ secthms ] the results , some known and some new , but defer the proofs until section  [ secproofs ] , after illustrating application of the results on a biologically important crn in section  [ secbioexample ] .",
    "a consequence of the analysis in section  [ secbioexample ] is previewed in figure  [ fig : mapk ] .",
    "finally , we present some discussion and conclusions .",
    "we provide only a brief , informal introduction to crns , and the reader is referred to @xcite for a more thorough discussion in a closely related framework .",
