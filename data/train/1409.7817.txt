    "colloidal crystals are a valuable model system , since the effective interactions between colloidal particles can be manipulated to a large extent . furthermore , convenient techniques to observe the structure and dynamics of such systems are available @xcite . colloidal dispersions under geometric confinement can serve us to understand the effects of confinement on the ordering of various types of nanoparticles .",
    "related phenomena occur in a wide variety of systems , e.g. ; electrons at the surface of liquid helium that is confined in a quasi - one - dimensional channel @xcite , dusty plasmas @xcite ; hard disks @xcite and magnetorheological @xcite colloids under confinement which are of great interest for various microfluidic and other applications .",
    "two - dimensional colloidal dispersions have been used successfully in studies on melting in two dimensions during the last decades @xcite . in previous studies ,",
    "much attention has been paid to the generic effect of confinement on crystalline order in @xmath2 and to the extent and range over which the confining boundaries disturb ( or enhance , respectively ) the degree of order .",
    "the effect of external walls on phase behavior has been studied for a long time @xcite .",
    "the confining wall can cause structural transition such as layering transition @xcite .",
    "another interesting aspect of confinement is related to formation of extended defects , solitonic staircase and standing strain wave superstructures @xcite . in this paper",
    "we intend to gain a more insight and shed more lights onto a previously studied problem which is a two dimensional confined colloidal system between two walls which exert forces on the particles @xcite .",
    "we implement molecular dynamics simulation and compare our findings to those obtained earlier by monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "consider a @xmath0 system of zero size soft disks , i.e. ; point particles , interacting under a purely repulsive force with the inverse power law potential @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the distance between particles .",
    "the motivation for taking the spatial dimension @xmath2 comes from experimental fact that some colloidal particles with super paramagnetic cores in the interface of water - air thin film can be described by a @xmath0 system of particles interacting with the above repulsive potential with @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "however , the exponent @xmath6 is taken to be @xmath7 for computational convenience in our paper .",
    "we recall that taking @xmath5 makes the potential long range which is computationally inconvenient and needs special treatment . choosing @xmath8 has the merit that we can compare our findings with the bulk results obtained by extensive simulations @xcite .",
    "we have chosen the cutoff distance @xmath9 and has adopted a reduced system of units in which @xmath10 and @xmath11 are taken as unity ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "now we discuss how to represent the effect of confining walls .",
    "one choice is to take a smooth repulsive wall located at @xmath13 , described by a wall potential @xcite @xmath14 .",
    "the motivation for a decay with the 10th power is the idea that such a potential would result if we have a semi infinite crystal with a power law interaction given by the above equation , but no cutoff , and the total potential is summed over the half space @xcite .",
    "we initially set the particles on the sites of a triangular lattice which is confined between a two dimensional channel .",

    "these two configurations are mapped into each other by a ninety degree rotation ( see figure two ) .",
    "as we shall see in the rest of the paper , the elastic properties of the confined colloidal solid differs notably for these configurations .",
    "we show the distance between the first ( last ) column of particles from the left ( right ) wall by @xmath26 respectively .",
