    "on february 23 , 1987 , several experiments   @xcite contributed to begin the era of extragalactic neutrino astronomy .",
    "these observations had an enormous impact on astrophysics and on particle physics .",
    "a straightforward interpretation of these data is yet _",
    "difficult_. this is due not only to the fact that we lack a firmly established theory of supernova explosion , but also to certain anomalous features of the data that have been understood , emphasized and analyzed in the course of the time . in particular , this is the case of the average energy deduced by the 12 events observed in kamiokande - ii ( kii ) , which is half of that observed by imb , and also lower then what expected in theoretical models for supernova neutrino emission , recently reviewed in   @xcite .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to propose an interpretation of this apparent discrepancy .    the low energy feature of kii dataset is clearly reflected in the outcome of two recent analyses of these data , that explore certain possibilities that deviate strongly from theoretical expectations .",
    "the first one is by mirizzi and raffelt   @xcite , who describe the distribution in @xmath2 energies as @xmath3 $ ] and find that the best fit of kii data is provided by @xmath4 ( _ i.e. _ , a monotonically decreasing distribution ) .",
    "the second one is the analysis of lunardini   @xcite , who adopts a two - component distribution as suggested by three flavor oscillation scenarios and finds that a component with @xmath5  mev permits to fit kii data better .",
    "this type of approaches is useful to emphasize features of the data like the excess of low energy events in kii dataset but one should recall that neither @xmath5 mev nor @xmath4 are compatible with the current expectations for supernova neutrino emission , so that in a conservative analysis , these values should not be allowed .",
    "stated otherwise , there is a trend in modern studies of sn1987a to accept the opinion that kii data are incompatible with the present theoretical expectations and , consequently , to start from this position to investigate more or less radical departures from the conventional paradigm for neutrino emission .",
    "one could even think that the failures to obtain a theory of supernova explosion could motivate such an attitude .",
    "but the fact that we do not have yet a definitive theory of the explosion does not mean that all theoretical possibilities are _ a priori _ equivalent .",
    "furthermore , one should be careful in distinguishing between the problems of getting a theory of supernova explosion and the problem of knowing the distribution of the emitted neutrinos . in the only scenario that has been explored in some details till now , the so called `` delayed scenario '' @xcite , a large amount of the neutrinos  up to 90  % is emitted in a phase that _ follows _ the explosion : thus , the two problems are to a certain extent independent ( we will better analyze the connection in the following ) . comparing   @xcite and",
    "@xcite we note that the expected range of one crucial parameter , the average @xmath2 energies or temperatures , did not change much since 1989 .",
    "what changed is the expectation on the temperature of the other antineutrinos and thus the impact of oscillations , that after   @xcite can be argued to modify only slightly the observable @xmath2 signal . to summarize ,",
    "the main reasons why we are not convinced that we should abandon the conventional paradigm for neutrino emission are that : 1 )  the expectations for neutrino emission seem to be stable ; 2 )  conversely , there is no convincing theoretical argument till now supporting an interpretation of the excess of low energy events in terms of low energy supernova neutrinos .",
    "also , on general statistical ground one should be aware of the risks of using the data12 events in the case of kii  to infer the characteristics of the model , rather than asking the significance level at which the null - hypothesis ( = the theoretical expectation ) is ruled out . in principle",
    "it is always possible to obtain a perfect fit ( @xmath6 ) to the data declaring that the observed distribution coincides with the expected one , but only if one is ready to renounce to the previous knowledge . in short",
    ", we believe that a discussion should address other questions : how severe is the deviation from the conventional theoretical expectations ?",
    "how reliable is the indication of a large amount of low energy supernova neutrinos , inferred from kii observations ?",
    "is it possible to conceive other interpretations ( more standard than the one proposed in @xcite and @xcite ) of the observed low energy events ?",
    "this is why we would like to explore the possibility that some of the low energy events in kii are not due to @xmath1 interactions of supernova neutrinos as usually assumed .",
    "the possibility that a few events are due to elastic scattering has been recently reconsidered   @xcite , finding that , although this can not be excluded , it helps only marginally to explain the excess of low energy events in kii data set .",
    "this forced the authors of   @xcite to admit that a few of these events are of a different origin , and possibly are due to background .",
    "this is a conservative position , since it is evident that the kii observations could be polluted by some background events : see figures  4 , 5 , 10 , 11 , 12 of the second publication of kii collaboration on sn1987a , _ i.e. _   @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in erenkov type detector it is not possible to know whether a single event is due to signal or to background . in our understanding , the main point of kii collaboration was just that it is not possible that all 12 events are due to background , which means that an observation of supernova neutrinos has been made ( as we show in sect .  [ ed ] , the _ a priori _ knowledge of the signal reinforces significantly this evidence ) .",
    "it should be noted that the kii collaboration did not quantify the probability that the 12 events are due to background on individual basis ; the only step in this direction was to exclude occasionally one specific event , occurred below the threshold for solar neutrinos events ( more discussion on this issue in sect .",
    "[ et ] ) . in this note , we analyze quantitatively the possibility that some background events occurred in the kii dataset , extending and complementing the analysis of   @xcite .",
    "in particular , we focus our attention on the spatial and the energy distribution of the 12 candidate events .",
    "we are aware of the problems of small numbers statistics , that there are many more papers on sn1987a neutrinos than events , and that there is the risk of running into ` forensics ' ( quoting a witticism of john beacom ) . nevertheless , we should also recall that supernovae are rare events on human timescale , and that all we have at the moment is one observation of supernova neutrinos and some theoretical ideas to compare with .",
    "in other words , we feel that we have the duty to analyze all possible hints for anomalies and to extract as much information as we can from sn1987a neutrinos .",
    "the plan of this paper is the following : in sect .",
    "[ sep ] we discuss the tools we have to separate signal from background events ; in sect .  [ discu ] we formulate definite hypotheses on the background and on the signal events , and show that the average energy of sn1987a neutrinos agrees much better with the expectations when we account for the presence of a few background events ; in sect .",
    "[ ddu ] we comment on the approach we used and the results we obtained , and finally draw our conclusions .",
    "we begin recalling what are the known and the unknown aspects for the analysis of the events observed in kii .",
    "several ( though not all ) characteristics of the background are known : the events are poisson distributed with a given rate , they have relatively low energy , and they are more frequent in the border of the volume used in the analysis   @xcite , that touches the planes of the photo - tubes . the characteristics of the signal are , instead , known theoretically : the events are distributed uniformly in the detector , they have relatively high energy , and their rate is not precisely known . going into details , the characteristics of the background and of the signal that we will use are :    _ 1 ) _ the volume of the kii detector used in the analysis of sn1987a neutrinos has @xmath7 for a volume of 2140 tons .",
    "this volume is much larger than the 680 tons fiducial volume defined in   @xcite , where background events are rare .",
    "we know that this wide volume is not free from background   @xcite .",
    "the energy distribution of the background in our figure  [ fig2 ] is obtained by multiplying the background per unit time given in figure  2a of lamb and loredo   @xcite by the time elapsed from the first to the last events , @xmath8 that makes 2.3 background events on average and 0.272 of them above the threshold of 7.5 mev .",
    "the assumption on the background has been validated by checking that the distributions of @xmath9 obtained from figure  4 of   @xcite and the average number of background events shown in figure  10 of the same kii paper are in good agreement with what we obtain with our distribution .",
    "more discussion of the assumed background is in sect .",

    "_ 2 ) _ the supernova neutrino signal is supposed to be due to @xmath10 ( ` inverse beta decay ' ) reaction .",
    "we use the cross section in   @xcite to perform the integration on the neutrino energy using the full matrix element and kinematical range .",
    "the antineutrino flux that we assume is the one described in sects .",
    "i and  ii of   @xcite , with the parameters of equation  8 there ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 average energy 10  % higher than @xmath2 as in   @xcite , energy equipartition and @xmath13 ) , including oscillations .",
    "the two crucial input parameters are : @xmath14 \\mbox{average energy of } \\overline{\\nu}_e&= & 14 \\mbox { mev } \\end{array } \\label{parama}\\ ] ] the first value is just in the middle of theoretical expectations .",
    "instead , the value of the average energy of @xmath15 is on the low side , but compatible with the present theoretical expectations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it fits well the imb observations @xcite , that consisting of a sample of 8 high energy events are in practice background free .",
    "two simple tests permit us to check that these values are reasonable : a )  when the emitted antineutrino energy is compared with the ( fermionic ) stefan - boltzmann law @xmath16 , it corresponds to an emission from a spherical surface of radius @xmath17 km that lasts 12.6 seconds .",
    "b )  the energy radiated compares well with lattimer - yahil formulae @xcite .",
    "in fact , assuming the total emitted energy is 6 times larger than the one emitted in antineutrinos ( equipartition ) , the expected value @xmath18 erg gives @xmath19 ; then the initial mass of the stellar core is @xmath20 .",
    "see   @xcite for further discussion of the selected model . with this model , we expect 11.8 signal events in kamiokande - ii",
    ".    with more detailed experimental information , more precise statements could be possible ; it would be useful to know the background rate for any single event ( taking into account the specific position , number of hit phototubes and photoelectrons , possible correlations , _ etc _ ) ; the error on the position of any event ; the energy distribution of the _ two _ components of the background , namely the one which is located in the border ( of higher energy ) and the one that is distributed in the volume ( of lower energy ) . with reference to the last point , we quote the kamiokande - ii collaboration   @xcite : the events with @xmath21 `` are consistent with higher - energy products of radioactivity at or outside the tank wall '' whereas `` the events with @xmath22 are largely due to @xmath23bi decay '' ( from the @xmath24rn chain ) and thus , presumably , more uniformly distributed . in the present paper",
    "we resort only to the published information on the background @xcite .    in the following of this section",
    ", we will obtain some new hints on possible background events without the need of adopting a specific model for neutrino emission .",
    "however , when we will pass to the comparison of the expectations and the observed energy distribution , we will adopt the well - specified model for the signal of eq .",
    "[ parama ] obtaining in this way other hints on possible background events . at this point",
    ", one could think that the conclusions that we reach on background are not reliable , since they depend at least partly on the assumed model for neutrino emission .",
    "thus , in order to avoid confusion , we prefer to repeat that the first purpose of our analysis is to check whether there is a problem with the conventional expectations for the supernova neutrinos , and the second is to ask whether this problem can be solved by making reasonable assumptions on the background .",
    "so , the use of a theoretically motivated model to compare with is not only justified , but is in fact a necessary first step .",
    "we will stick as much as possible to the very simple model defined above , but will also consider reasonable ( theoretically acceptable ) modifications from the assumed model , showing that most of the results and the indications we obtain are stable .",
    "of course , if a new paradigm for neutrino emission will eventually emerge , it will be important to update these considerations and repeat the calculations described below .",
    "the tools that we describe in this section are the spatial ( sect .",
    "[ sd ] ) , the energy distribution of the events ( sect .",
    "[ ed ] ) and the energy threshold used by kamiokande - ii collaboration ( sect .",

    "note that these 6 cases alone cover 61% of the 4096 possibilities . *",
    "the event number 6 is due to background in 90% of the cases .    in summary",
    ", the existence of a accretion phase brings a new twist in the analysis of the backgrounds , and leads to somewhat different conclusions especially regarding the interpretation of the event number 4 .",
    "however , the new analysis still leads us to expect that some low energy events among the events number 3,6,10,12 could be attributed to background .      in view of the discussion of the previous section , the interpretation proposed in section  [ ansa ]",
    "does not need a real revision , except , possibly , replacing the event 4 with the event 12 in the role of candidate background event .",
    "however , the wider theoretical context also allows us to take a new point of view , or in other words , it is possible to formulate another way out from the ` problem ' of low energy events .",
    "in fact , one could argue that the events occurred during the non - thermal phase ( accretion ) should not be compared with the ones occurred later .",
    "in particular , the average energy of the first four kii events is @xmath25  mev , that is pretty much lower than the one of the next seven events ( the event number 6 being attributed to background ) , namely @xmath26  mev .",
    "of course this is due to the presence of a few low energy events among the first events ( the events 3 and 4 ) . but while in section  [ ansa ] we regarded them as as possible background events , here we are lead to suggest that they ( or at least some of them ) are due to a _ peculiar _ phase of neutrino emission , that in principle could be characterized by a lower average energy than during thermal phase . in short , the fact that kii measured several low energy events can be at least _ partly _ attributed to the fact that some of these events occurred during accretion . in order to have an acceptable volumetric distribution ,",
    "it is sufficient to assign only one additional event between 3 and 10 ( along with event 6 ) to background .",
    "we have shown in sect .",
    "[ discu ] that the agreement between the observed and expected average energy of supernova neutrinos improves significantly assuming that 2 - 4 of the low energy events in kii are due to background , and that this interpretation is supported by the volumetric distribution of the events .",
    "a few of these low energy events could also belong to a peculiar phase of neutrino emission ( `` accretion '' ) , contributing to solve the ` problem ' .",
    "in other words , we believe that the null hypothesis ( _ i.e. _ , the minimal model ) is not significantly challenged by the excess of low energy events observed by kamiokande - ii ( or : we have enough freedom to evade the conclusion that there is a problem with the conventional expectations ) . here",

    "the new values of @xmath46 have been obtained as follows : below 10 mev , we obtain accurate data from the plot of ll , whereas , above , this is not of much use ; above 9 mev , however , we can use the background curves denoted as step1 and step2 shown in fig.3 of @xcite for the purpose of solar neutrino studies , with the conversion between energy and @xmath9 given there ( step1 agrees with the curve of ll , where comparable ) . below 7 mev , the new procedure leads to higher @xmath46 ( ev.s  6 , 13 - 16 ) ; from 7.5 to about 9 mev , there is no significant difference with the procedure of ll ( ev.s  3 , 10 , 12 ) ; between 9 ad 17 mev , the background curves in @xcite suggest a lower @xmath46 ( ev.s  2,4,5,11 ) ; above  in the most uncertain but safest from the background point of view , and also less crucial region for parameter estimation  we assume a lower background rate than assumed by ll ( ev.s 1 , 7 - 9 ) .",

    "we analyze critically the hypothesis that the events from the signal are uniformly distributed . in the relevant publications",
    "@xcite we were not able to find warnings against important systematics of this type , but we tentatively identified three such physical effects that could affect the observed signal events : + _ geometry : _ the events occurring close to the border and propagating toward the closer wall could be missed , since the erenkov light could pass through the phototubes without being recorded . in our understanding , this is the main reason why the detection efficiency of kamiokande - ii never reaches 100% , even for the higher energy events , but is at most 92% . in order to test this hypothesis , we considered the external part of the detector that has a distance from the phototubes smaller than their typical distance of 1 meter .",
    "since this part has a volume of about 800 m@xmath51 , we reproduce the 92% efficiency if @xmath52% of the events are lost in this way , that is a reasonable figure being comfortably smaller than 40% . again",
    ", this effect leads us to expect that the loss of signal events is more significant for the events produced close to the border , especially for @xmath53 , that corresponds to the external part of the detector considered just above .",

    "this means that @xmath56% of the total number of events are systematically lost close to the border , and that even at @xmath57 , the loss is smaller than 40% .",
    "+ _ light attenuation : _ the light from the low energy events can be lost because of light attenuation , where @xmath58 m ( in @xcite , we read that @xmath59 `` exceeds 50 m at any time '' ) .",
    "let us evaluate the average attenuation coefficient for kamiokande - ii detector , as a function of the volumetric coordinate @xmath60 .",
    "considering the simplified case of propagation in straight rays , we find the differential distribution in the variable @xmath60 by averaging over the other coordinates that specify the position of the event and the direction of emission : @xmath61+a[f^{1/3},u f^{1/3},c,\\phi ] } { 3\\pi } \\label{daf}\\ ] ] where @xmath62=(e^{-d_{in}/\\lambda}+e^{-d_{out}/\\lambda})/2 $ ] is the average attenuation for a given direction of observation , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the two distances from the walls of the detector ( see also table  [ tab1 ] ) , and we measure the radial coordinate @xmath65 in units of @xmath66 and the height @xmath67 in units of @xmath68 .",
    "a straightforward calculation gives the approximation for @xmath69 , that means that the events produced in the center suffer an attenuation effect that is @xmath70 larger .",
    "the systematic effect due to light attenuation depends on the energy .",
    "if we _ assume _ that the signal is uniformly distributed in energy , we are lead to expect that the loss of low energy events from the center is more significant . + _ spectrum : _ however , the previous point does not take into account the real spectrum of the signal . in order to demonstrate that this is also relevant",
    ", it is enough to consider a simple one dimensional situation , when the light propagates just in one direction or the opposite one .",
    "let us compare what happens to the events produced in the middle ( @xmath71 ) and in the border of the detector ( @xmath72 ) . in the first case , the light attention effect is @xmath73 , where @xmath74 m is the linear size of the detector ; in the second case , this depends on whether the event propagates toward the closer border ( no attenuation ) or toward the opposite border , when we have @xmath75 . in the first case",
    ", we lose all the events between @xmath76 and @xmath77 , where @xmath76 is the minimal number of photons that gives a trigger ; in the second one , we lose half of the events between @xmath76 and @xmath78 ( where @xmath79 ) .",
    "if the signal is uniformly distributed in energy , we see that at @xmath80 the effect is identical in the two cases ; thus , the effect described by eq .  [ daf ] is purely three dimensional .",
    "but if the distribution of the signal increases with the energy , as we expect , the loss of signal events is more significant for the events produced close to the border .",
    "in fact , the events that fall below the detection threshold in the first case ( events produced close to @xmath71 ) are those that belong to the least populated part of the spectrum . _",
    "e.g. _ , if we assume that the energy spectrum of the signal rises linearly from zero , the total number of remaining events in the region @xmath81 is 50% larger in the first case .",
    "this last effect is presumably the less relevant one .    in summary",
    ", various effects can change the distribution of the detected signal events : the second effect increases a bit the number of expected supernova neutrino events close to the border , the other two diminish it .",
    "it is not possible to estimate precisely the systematics deviations from uniformity without a detailed simulation of the detector response that takes into account the energy distribution of the signal , the role of energy fluctuations , _",
    "etc_. however , if we account for the two systematics effects that work in opposite directions simply by multipling @xmath54 $ ] by @xmath82 $ ] , we see that the geometrical effect is the most important one .",
    "this is the reason why we claim that the gof with a uniform volume distribution underestimates a possible problem with events close to the border : in fact , when we apply the scvm test to the 12 events seen by kamiokande - ii we get a gof of 3.4% rather than the value that we obtain with uniform distribution , 4.6% ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "similarly , when we discard event 6 , the value of the gof becomes 1.8% rather than 2.4% ( again in table  [ tab2 ] ) . as we see , the changes due to a more accurate modeling of the detector response are not expected to be very large , and are in any case smaller than the changes due to the use of alternative statistical tests ( see next appendix ) .",
    "the anderson - darling ( ad ) test @xcite is used to test if a sample of data comes from a specific distribution .",
    "it is a modification of the kolmogorov - smirnov test and gives more weight to the boundary region than the smirnov - cramr - von mises test .    consider a set of data @xmath83 , arranged in increasing order .",
    "given the expected cumulative distribution function @xmath84 $ ] , we calculate the values in the points @xmath85 : @xmath86\\ ] ] next , consider the empirical cumulative distribution function @xmath87 $ ] , that counts the number of events below @xmath88 ; thus , @xmath87=j / n$ ] for @xmath89 , where we set @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "the quantitative indicator of the likelihood of the given data proposed by anderson and darling is : @xmath92-u)^2\\ \\psi[u]\\ du \\",
    "\\right |_{f[x]=u}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 is a positive function on the interval @xmath94 .",
    "the case when @xmath95 gives the well - known smirnov - cramr - von mises test , that somehow resembles the @xmath96 statistics : @xmath97 let us pass to the alternative possibilities .",
    "the traditional ( two sided ) version of the anderson - darling test statistic is obtained setting @xmath98=1/(u ( 1-u))$ ] , that gives : @xmath99   \\label{adtrad}\\ ] ] this provides a particular sensitivity close to the points @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "a trivial modification consists in setting @xmath98=1/(1-u)$ ] : in this way , the test becomes particularly sensitive close to @xmath101 .",
    "the modified ( or one sided ) anderson - darling test statistic can be written as : @xmath102   \\label{admod}\\ ] ] since @xmath103 , equation  [ adtrad ] can be recovered by summing a third test statistic when we replace @xmath98=1/u$ ] , that would be suited to test for features close to @xmath100 ( the practical formula for this third test statistic is obtained replacing @xmath104 in equation  [ admod ] ) .",
    "a null - hypothesis that we want to test is whether a pre - selected subset of the kii data is uniformly distributed in the detector , as expected if they are due to supernova neutrino events .",
    "thus , in our case the number of data is @xmath105 , the coordinate @xmath88 is what is called @xmath60 in sect .",
    "[ sd ] , and the cumulative distribution function is simply @xmath84=x$ ] .",
    "the ad tests of eqs .",
    "[ adtrad ] and [ admod ] are of particular interest since the points close to @xmath106 are in the border of the volume used in the analysis , and , there , it is not possible to exclude _ a priori _ an effect of contamination from the background .",
    "given the test statistics , we calculate the value @xmath107 for the subset of kii data in which we are interested . how often this value results from a uniform distribution ? this can be obtained with a straightforward procedure : 1 )  we extract randomly @xmath108 data from a uniform distribution for @xmath109 times ( @xmath110 in our case ) ; 2 )  we calculate the value of @xmath111 for each data set ; 3 )  finally , we test the frequency of the condition @xmath112 , namely , the number of times @xmath113 that this condition is satisfied over the number of extractions  @xmath109 .    _",
    "e.g. _ , we infer from the test of equation  [ adtrad ] that when all 12 events ( resp . , all except event 6 ) are supposed to be due to supernova neutrinos , we get @xmath114 ( resp . , @xmath115 ) . a value this high can occur as a result of a statistical fluctuations , but only in 0.32 % ( resp",
    ", 0.13 % ) of the cases ; this means that we can reject the hypothesis that the 12 ( resp .",
    ", 11 ) events are uniformly distributed at the 2.9 @xmath0 ( resp .",

    "similarly , we infer from the test of equation  [ admod ] that the case when all events ( resp . , all except event 6 ) are assumed to be signal can be rejected at the @xmath116 @xmath0 ( resp . , 3.8 @xmath0 ) significance level .    in principle , it is possible to object that the situations when different statistical tests give very different outcomes should be regarded as dubious and that the statistical criterion would be better selected _ a priori _ rather than _ a posteriori _ ; these are the reasons why in this paper we do not use exclusively the ( more powerful ) ad test , but also the ( more conventional ) scvm test .",

    "<S> the observation of several low energy events during sn1987a burst has an important weight in the attempts to learn about the properties of the supernova neutrinos , but is somewhat puzzling if compared with the expectations . in this work , we study the low energy events observed by kamiokande - ii , and consider in particular the possibility that a few of them are due to background . </S>",
    "<S> we focus our attention not only on the event 6 , that falls below the energy threshold of 7.5 mev , but also on the other four events that at 1 @xmath0 fall below the energy threshold , namely the events 3,4,10,12 . </S>",
    "<S> the _ a priori _ expectations on the number of background events above threshold would suggest 1 or 2 background events only . </S>",
    "<S> the volume distribution of the kamiokande - ii events is not a uniform distribution at 3 @xmath0 , that suggests the presence of background events close or at the border of the volume used for the analysis , including the events 3,4,10 . </S>",
    "<S> next we checked the expected energy distribution assuming that the signal is due to @xmath1 and that the average antineutrino energy is 14 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement with the observations is not perfect , but it is acceptable at the 11 % confidence level if we include the peak of low energy background events ; otherwise , we face a 2.9  @xmath0 problem . </S>",
    "<S> the expected energy distribution implies that the evidence for supernova neutrinos is at 10 @xmath0 and that 1 - 3 background events are plausible . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion does not change strongly when we model the time distribution of the signal , taking into account the presence of an initial luminous phase of neutrino emission . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests however that some of the early events ( in particular , event 4 ) are due to supernova neutrinos and not to background . in summary , </S>",
    "<S> our comparison between the expectations and the data lead us to formulate the hypothesis that some of the observed low energy events are due to background and that some among them belong to a peculiar phase of emission , that could be further characterized by low energy neutrinos . </S>",

    "<S> ( model dependent ) expectations on the number of background events . </S>",
    "<S> we argue on these grounds that there is no significant disagreement between the average energy of the supernova neutrinos seen in kamiokande - ii and the conventional expectations . </S>",
