    "the mode coupling theory ( mct ) of the glass transition is by now an important tool to understand experiments in and simulations of supercooled liquids @xcite . for a long time most of the theoretical investigations concentrated on simple monoatomic or binary liquids .",
    "all universal and even system specific predictions of these investigations could be tested on a _ quantitative _ level in a system of hard colloids @xcite , which is an excellent realization of a hard sphere system and in computer simulations for a binary lennard jones system @xcite .",
    "details of theory and tests for simple glass formers can be found in review articles @xcite and articles cited therein .",
    "although the theory was originally formulated only for these simple systems , most of the experimental and simulation support came from research on much more complex system ( e.g. tri-@xmath7-naphtylbenzene @xcite , orthoterphenyl ( otp ) @xcite , @xmath8 ( ckn ) @xcite , glycerol @xcite , salol @xcite , toluene @xcite and water @xcite ) . also most of the experimental methods used , did _ not _ measure density correlation functions or their susceptibilities , for which the original theory was formulated .",
    "even neutron scattering experiments in systems consisting of molecules whose components have different cross sections for neutrons @xcite do not measure the density correlation function exclusively , but a mixture of more complicated correlation functions involving molecular degrees of freedom @xcite ( see also @xcite for a single linear molecule ) .",
    "dielectric loss measurements @xcite measure directly the correlation function of a tensor of rank @xmath9 .",
    "depolarized light scattering @xcite , kerr effect experiments @xcite , nmr @xciteand esr @xcite ( and references therein ) measure correlation function of a tensor of rank @xmath10 .",
    "the mentioned tensorial quantities are all related to orientational degrees of freedom ( odof ) , whereas the original theory @xcite only considered translational degrees of freedom ( tdof ) , i.e. the center of mass motion .",
    "but of course , when comparing experimental results on complex systems with predictions of the mct for simple liquids it was always reasonable to argue , that there are in every experiment couplings to the center of mass motion .",
    "e.g. the reorientation of dipoles measured in dielectric loss measurements can induce center of mass motion via a translation - rotation coupling .",
    "also the reorientation of the polarizability tensor in light scattering measurements is related to a physical rotation of the molecules and will therefore be coupled to the center of mass motion of the molecules as well . a slowing down of this motion due to very slow structural relaxations can consequently also indirectly be measured in the mentioned experiments .",
    "in addition it is perfectly justified to perform tests of the _ universal _ predictions of mct in complicated molecular and polymeric systems @xcite for @xmath1 scaling laws and properties of the @xmath7 relaxation , like time temperature superposition principle and wave vector dependent stretching exponents , since the underlying universal features of the bifurcation scenario should also remain valid for molecular systems .",
    "but beyond the universal aspects mct aims to be a microscopic theory of structural relaxation .",
    "this goal is to a large extent achieved for simple liquids .",
    "there it was possible to obtain quantitative agreement between experiment and theory for the full dynamic range of structural relaxation ( i.e. @xmath1 and @xmath7 - relaxation ) @xcite .",
    "recently also a theory for anomalous high frequency oscillations ( bose peak phenomenon ) was formulated within mct @xcite .",
    "the molecular mode coupling theory ( mmct ) which is under study for a few years now , intends to extend this line of research to experimentally relevant molecular systems .",
    "there are three different mode coupling theories for the description of different aspects of molecular degrees of freedom . in @xcite the motion of a single linear molecule in a liquid of spherical atoms",
    "is studied . in @xcite a site - site description is formulated , which is perfectly adapted to study neutron scattering experiments of molecular systems . in this approach the atomic structure of the molecules",
    "is considered . finally ,",
    "the mmct @xcite , we are using in this work @xcite , is devised to investigate the dynamics of a liquid of linear molecules . for this purpose a self consistent mode coupling theory for the dynamic correlation functions of tensorial densities @xmath11 was developed .",
    "these densities are the generalized fourier components of the microscopic density @xmath12 in an expansion in spherical harmonics with respect to the orientation @xmath13 of the molecules and plane waves with respect to @xmath14 .",
    "an extension to arbitrary molecules is given in @xcite .",
    "a theory for arbitrary molecules was also formulated in @xcite .",
    "first results for the tensorial nonergodicity parameters ( nep ) and critical amplitudes were obtained for dipolar hard spheres @xcite and @xcite , respectively . a study of the phase diagram for glass transitions of a liquid of hard ellipsoids was performed in ref .",
    "several aspects of the theory for general molecules were tested against simulation for water in ref . @xcite and treating water as a linear molecule in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as in the mct for simple liquids the static structure factors @xmath15 in the q frame ,",
    "i.e. the coordinate system in which the @xmath16 axis is along the wavevector , completely determines the longtime dynamics and thus the nep and critical amplitudes .",
    "note that the structure factors ( static and dynamic ) are diagonal in @xmath17 in the q -frame @xcite .",
    "the static structure factors have to be known to solve the equations of mmct .",
    "they are either obtained by analytical theories as e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite for ellipsoids or they have to be taken from simulations . in this work we present a detailed comparison of mmct calculations of the nep and critical amplitudes with the results of simulation for a liquid of diatomic molecules .",
    "a description of the system and the simulation can be found in @xcite .",
    "there also tests of the universal properties of mct are presented . for our comparison between simulation and theory",
    "the static structure factors are taken from the simulation . in a preliminary study",
    "only the diagonal static correlators @xmath18 were used as input and also the dynamical correlators @xmath19 and thus the nep were assumed to be diagonal @xcite .",
    "this severe approximation has lead to unphysical results like the existence of two different transition temperature for odof and tdof . in our study",
    "we use diagonal _ and _ non diagonal elements of the static structure factor as input to calculate _ all _ components of the nep and , in addition , of the critical amplitudes . for the calculation of the nep",
    ", we also extend the necessary upper cut off @xmath3 for the index @xmath20 to @xmath21 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in chapter ( [ mct_chap ] )",
    "we review the main equations and concepts for the calculation of the critical nep ( [ neptheory ] ) and the critical amplitudes ( [ amplitudetheory ] ) . in chapter ( [ results ] ) we discuss the influence of different approximation schemes on the theoretically obtained critical temperatures ( [ tc ] ) and its relation to simulation results",
    ". then we present the comparison of theoretical critical nep ( [ nepresult ] ) and critical amplitudes ( [ amplituderesult ] ) with simulations .",
    "conclusions are presented in chapter [ conclusions ] and an appendix describes how the critical nep can be obtained from the liquid side close the the ideal glass transition .",
    "the derivation of the equation of mmct for the dynamics of linear molecules and general molecules can be found in @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "we only repeat the basic definitions and equations and refer the reader for details to the literature . for the present work ,",
    "in which we want to calculate the critical nep and the critical amplitudes of diatomic molecules , we only need the equations for linear molecules in the limit of time to infinity .",
    "the basic quantities are the correlation functions of tensorial densities @xmath22 and tensorial current densities @xmath23 @xmath24 the @xmath25 are the standard spherical harmonics and we follow in our notation the text book by gray and gubbins @xcite .",
    "@xmath26 is either the center of mass velocity @xmath27 of the @xmath28 molecule or its angular velocity @xmath29 depending on the index @xmath7 : @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 stands for translational and rotational part , respectively .",
    "for the calculation of the nep we in principal need all spatial components of the currents but here we use as in @xcite only the projection on directions defined by the wave vector @xmath33 and the angular momentum operator @xmath34 . taking into account also transversal currents",
    "will lead only to small correction in the nep @xcite .",
    "we therefore define the _ longitudinal _ currents @xmath23 . @xmath35 with @xmath36 and the definition @xmath37 .",
    "the quantities we are going to calculate are nep @xmath38 in the q -frame i.e. in a coordinate system in which the z - axis is given by the direction of the wave vector @xmath39 . in this coordinate system all correlation functions @xmath40 are diagonal in @xmath17 .",

    "the prime at the first summation in eq.([mct ] ) restricts @xmath61 such , that @xmath62 .",
    "( [ frac1 ] - [ frac2 ] ) and ( [ mct ] ) form a closed set of infinitely many coupled nonlinear equations for the nep . to obtain a solvable theory we have to restrict @xmath20 to be smaller than an upper cut off , @xmath63 .",
    "the resulting equations can in principle be solved by a fixed point iteration algorithm .",
    "the physical control parameter like the temperature and the density only enter via the static structure factor . at a critical temperature or density the solution of this equations bifurcates from all functions @xmath64 being zero to nonzero . in the simulations of kmmerer et al .",
    "@xcite the temperature was used as control parameter .",
    "close to the transition temperature @xmath5 the stability matrix of the iteration ( see below ) will have a largest eigenvalue @xmath65 approaching @xmath66 from below .",
    "consequently the convergence of the iteration is getting very slow close to @xmath5 .",
    "the time for one iteration depends very sensitive on the upper cut off @xmath3 . for",
    "@xmath67 one iteration took @xmath68 minutes on a mips r10000 , for @xmath69 this time increased to 6 hours .",
    "we therefore concentrated on @xmath70 , to determine the transition point with a high accuracy and used the calculation for @xmath21 mostly as check for the sensitivity of our results against changing the cut off .    to overcome some of the restrictions connected to the critical slowing down of the convergence close to @xmath5 we determined the critical nep , i.e. the nep at @xmath5 , with two alternative methods .",
    "for the standard fixed point iteration we started at a temperature low enough to be in the glass state .",
    "then the temperature is increased very slowly . at every temperature",
    "the equations for the nep are solved by the iteration    @xmath71    where @xmath72 is the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ frac1 ] ) and @xmath73 .",
    "this iteration converges exponentially fast towards its solution as long as the temperature is not the critical temperature .",
    "the convergence rate is determined by the largest eigenvalue @xmath65 of the stability tensor @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "the index @xmath75 is an abbreviation for wavevectors @xmath76 and rotational indices @xmath77 .",
    "the exponential convergence rate is then @xmath78 .",
    "close to and below @xmath5 the eigenvalue @xmath65 can be written as @xmath79 with a being a positive constant .",
    "therefore the convergence rate is @xmath80 and the number of iterations to obtain convergence diverges inversely proportional to @xmath81 close to @xmath5 . with this number of iterations",
    "the deviations of our nep from the true critical nep are proportional to @xmath81 , since the nep exhibit the well known square root singularity ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "if the temperature is increased above @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath82 , there is no non zero solution for the iteration eq .",
    "( [ iterate ] ) .",
    "nevertheless for @xmath83 , the iteration is nearly stationary for a large number of iteration of the order @xmath84 ( see appendix ) .",
    "the approximate critical nep is determined as the stationary point @xmath85 whose change along the eigenvector with eigenvalue 1 of the _ critical _ stability matrix is minimal during iteration .",
    "but contrary to the nep determined from the fixed point iteration for @xmath86 , the stationary nep differ only in order @xmath87 instead in order @xmath81 from the true critical nep .",
    "consequently this property allows us in the following to crosscheck the very accurate results for @xmath70 obtained from the fixed point iteration and also to obtain the critical nep for @xmath6 .",
    "a central prediction of the mode coupling theory of the glass transition in simple liquids is the existence of the @xmath1 - relaxation regime @xcite . for the problem of a single dumbbell in an isotropic hard sphere system @xcite it was demonstrated , that the @xmath1 relaxation law can be detected in every quantity , which couples to the density . for a liquid of anisotropic molecules",
    "it is not very well defined which degree of freedom is driving the glass transition .",
    "the equations of mmct couple all degrees of freedom and there are situations where the transition is not caused by the tdof , but the odof @xcite .",
    "but even in these systems the factorization theorem is generically valid for all correlators .",
    "this can be proven using the standard techniques @xcite .",
    "therefore every dynamic structure factor @xmath88 can for @xmath89 in the @xmath1 relaxation regime be written as @xmath90    the function @xmath91 is the same for all @xmath92 .",
    "@xmath93 is an overall microscopic scale .",
    "@xmath94 are the critical amplitudes determining the intensity of the asymptotic @xmath1 - relaxation for a certain combination of @xmath77 and @xmath76 . also the correction to the asymptotics , which determine , besides the temperature , the range of validity of the law eq .",
    "( [ beta ] ) depend on these amplitudes ( cf .",
    "ref @xcite for simple liquids ) .",
    "differences in the observability of the critical correlators between depolarized light scattering experiments and dielectric loss measurements , can be explained by differences in the amplitudes @xmath94 involving @xmath95 and @xmath96 respectively ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a single molecule ) . to determine the amplitudes numerically to a high precision it is necessary to be very close to the transition point , to make sure that all correction terms of order @xmath97 are small compared to the leading term of order @xmath81 . due to the difficulties described above we",
    "could only determine the critical amplitudes for upper cut off @xmath98 .",
    "for @xmath98 and in the full diagonalization approximation @xcite , in which the static structure factors @xmath99 , the glass form factors @xmath100 and the memory matrix @xmath101 are assumed to be diagonal with respect to @xmath20 , the glass transition temperature for the tdof predicted by mmct is below the transition temperature of the md simulations @xmath102 .",
    "note , that this temperatures are given in lennard jones units ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in all other",
    "known examples the mct overestimates the tendency for vitrification . as an additional artefact of the full diagonalization the odof vitrify at a lower temperature than the tdof .",
    "since the top down symmetry of the dumbbells is broken , the full equations of mmct ( [ frac1 ] ) - ( [ mct ] ) do generically not allow for such a scenario .",
    "as soon as we take @xmath99 non diagonal all degrees of freedom undergo a glass transition at the same temperature above the md result .",
    "to study the influence of different diagonalization approximations a bit more in detail , we investigated several cases , with the main condition of @xmath99 being non diagonal :    1 .",
    "@xmath100 and @xmath101 diagonal [ dd ] 2 .",
    "@xmath100 diagonal and @xmath101 non diagonal [ dnd ] 3 .",
    "@xmath100 and @xmath101 non diagonal [ ndnd ]    let us discuss @xmath98 first .",
    "for this case @xmath5 has been determined very accurately from the asymptotic behavior @xmath103 ( see chapter [ amplitudetheory ] ) for the largest eigenvalue @xmath104 .",
    ". demonstrates this law for case ( [ ndnd ] ) .",
    "the highest transition temperature is obtained for case ( [ dd ] ) . here",
    "the transition temperature is roughly three times as large as the md result , @xmath105 . in case ( [ dnd ] )",
    "it only slightly decreases to @xmath106 . if everything is taken non diagonal ( case [ ndnd ] ) the transition temperature is @xmath107 . although still twice as large as the md result , the discrepancy of this result from @xmath108 is comparable to other known cases and consistent with the usual @xmath109 accuracy of the critical _ density _ @xcite .",
    "the equations are too complex to get a deeper theoretical understanding of this seemingly erratic jumping of the transition temperature , dependent on the approximation we are using . particularly the fact , that the vertices ( eq . [ vertex ] ) are not positive anymore , makes an analytical prediction impossible .",
    "but it is at least possible to rationalize the behavior using a combination of physical and mathematical arguments .",
    "first of all it is quite clear that the full diagonalization where all matrices are assumed to be diagonal is too crude to describe the coupling of tdof and odof for the system of diatomic molecules .",
    "the tdof and odof are only coupled via the diagonal memory function @xmath110 .",
    "the coupling of the equations for different @xmath20 is considerably reduced compared to the case where @xmath99 is taken to be non diagonal .",
    "e.g. in the @xmath111 component of the memory matrix only terms of the form ( symbolically ) @xmath112 appear in the full diagonalization approximation , since the clebsch gordan coefficients @xmath113 , which enter into the vertices ( cf .",
    "( [ mct ] ) - ( [ mctend ] ) ) are nonzero for @xmath114 only .",
    "similarly , the memory functional @xmath115 only contains couplings of the form @xmath116 and @xmath117 . for @xmath118 the clebsch gordan coefficients in the vertex allow `` self '' couplings @xmath119 , @xmath120 and couplings to @xmath121 in the form @xmath122 , but no `` self '' couplings @xmath123 . due to the absence of @xmath124 in @xmath125 a freezing of the center of mass motion , i.e. @xmath126",
    "does not imply a freezing for quadrupolar dynamics @xmath127 .",
    "if the vertex for the coupling of the nep with @xmath95 and @xmath121 in @xmath128 and @xmath129 are not large enough , exactly this structure of the memory matrix allows generically a separate transition of the @xmath121 and the @xmath130 components of the diagonalized dynamic structure factor as observed in @xcite .",
    "but we have to stress that the approximation is not per se inadequate . in the case of water",
    "@xcite the full diagonalization approximation leads to a rather satisfactory agreement with simulations , without the artefact of separate transitions and too low transition temperatures .",
    "the pronounced angular dependence of interaction between water molecules , which is reflected in the fact that the static structure factors for @xmath131 and @xmath121 are of the same order , yield large enough vertices to produce a single transition temperature of the tdof and odof . in the present case ,",
    "the structure factor @xmath132 is clearly more dominant than @xmath133 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_sqlm ] ) .",
    "this is different from water where all @xmath17 for @xmath127 are important .",
    "this leads to the a posteriori conclusion that in general the full diagonalization can only be used ( if at all ) for systems with `` very strong '' static translation rotation coupling .",
    "this statement , unfortunately , can not be further quantified .",
    "if we now take the non diagonality of @xmath99 serious but leave all other matrices diagonal ( case [ dd ] ) , _ additional _ coupling between tdof and odof appear , which may lead to an effectively stronger coupling .",
    "although the equations for the different @xmath20 components of the nep still couple only via the diagonal memory functions @xmath134 , the diagonalized memory matrix contains now _ static _ couplings between _ all _ nep .",
    "e.g. , @xmath115 contains additional couplings between the tdof - correlator @xmath135 and the correlators involving @xmath95 and , even more important , `` self coupling '' terms @xmath124 due to the non vanishing structure factors @xmath136 and @xmath137 , respectively .",
    "this of course does not explain , but at least makes plausible the dramatic increase of the transition temperature .",
    "any slowing down of let s say the tdof is immediately transferred to all other degrees of freedom and causes a further slowing down of the tdof due to the feed back via the memory function .",
    "this enhances the tendency towards vitrification and also is responsible for the existence of a single transition temperature .",
    "the reason for the decrease of the transition temperature , when we give up the diagonalization approximations for @xmath101 and @xmath100 ( case [ ndnd ] ) , is not obvious .",
    "we only note , that the transition temperature is decreasing from case [ dd ] ( @xmath138 ) over [ dnd ] ( @xmath139 ) to [ ndnd ] ( @xmath140 ) i.e. the more off diagonal elements of the matrix are taken into account .",
    "is the @xmath141 limit of the memory matrix i.e. the random force correlation function .",
    "therfore it seems , that the more components of the random forces are coupled , the lower is the transition temperature .",
    "this implies , that the more the random forces can mutually influence each other , the more difficult it is to form a glass .",
    "although we can not proof this statement on mathematical grounds , it describes an feasible physical phenomenon .    to test the sensitivity of our results to changes in the cut off",
    ", we also solved the mmct for upper cut off @xmath6 .",
    "the larger cut off value for @xmath20 reduces the transition temperature further towards the simulation result . for @xmath6 , an upper and a",
    "lower bound for @xmath5 has been determined .",
    "the lower bound is the highest temperature for which the nep are still nonzero after 88 iterations .",
    "the upper bound is the temperature for which the nep are converging to zero after about 24 iterations .",
    "since the time per iteration increases dramatically upon increasing the upper cut off the transition temperature could only be determined within @xmath142 , @xmath143 .",
    "it is encouraging that the real transition is approached upon increasing the cut off , but our arguments presented above , show , that this is not necessarily the case . which of the competing mechanisms influencing the transition temperature is dominant ,",
    "can not be predicted on general grounds .      in the following we concentrate on the results for the normalized nep @xmath144 without any diagonalization approximation .",
    "[ fig_nepdiag ] shows the normalized diagonal terms of the matrix of nep @xmath145 for @xmath146 .",
    "not shown are the results for @xmath147 , since they do not exhibit very much structure .",
    "the corresponding simulation result is taken from @xcite .",
    "it was obtained by fitting a von schweidler law plus corrections @xmath148 to the simulation results for the time dependent density correlation function @xmath149 , where @xmath150 is the @xmath7 - relaxation scale .",
    "there are three different theoretical curves .",
    "the two curves at temperatures @xmath151 are obtained with the fixed point method ( on the glass side of the transition ) and the quasi stability criterion ( on the liquid side ) , respectively , as described above for upper cut off @xmath98 .",
    "their good agreement demonstrates the high accuracy of the solution .",
    "the third theoretical curve shows the result for upper cut off @xmath6 using the more accurate quasi stability criterion . compared to the results in @xcite",
    "a clear improvement of the agreement with simulations can be observed .",
    "especially the q - dependence of the functions are very well reproduced .",
    "even a feature like the prepeak in @xmath152 at @xmath153 is reproduced as a shoulder in the corresponding theoretical result .",
    "this peak is not present in the static structure factors . since @xmath154 has a peak at about @xmath153 it could appear due to a dynamic coupling of the odof , especially the one involving @xmath96 and the tdof .",
    "note also , that the mentioned peak exactly corresponds to the first peak in @xmath155 .",
    "there is a tendency , that the agreement is best around the wave vector , where the structure factor @xmath156 has its first peak and is getting worse for large wave vectors .",
    "this might be interpreted as an indication for the glass transition being driven also for the investigated system of diatomic molecules by the tdof . from investigations of other systems",
    "@xcite , we know that different scenarios are possible .",
    "similar to increasing @xmath76 , the agreement between simulation and theory gets worse with increasing @xmath20 .",
    "this is expected due to two different reasons .",
    "first higher @xmath20 correspond to a higher angular resolution and are therefore probably much more affected by the mode coupling approximation .",
    "second , higher @xmath20 are of course much more sensitive to the cut off @xmath3 than lower @xmath20 .",
    "the curves for larger cut off increase the quality of the comparison with the md results .",
    "but it is important to note that in our case no general rule can be given of how much the quality of the results for lower values of @xmath20 can be improved by increasing the upper cut off , as this was done in @xcite . in the case of a single dumbbell in a liquid of hard spheres",
    "the glass transition temperature is completely determined by the hard sphere liquid and does not change by increasing the cut off @xmath3 . as explained above , in our case , @xmath5 can depend very sensitively on @xmath3 . but this influences directly the amplitude of the nep via the trivial effect of the temperature on the static structure factors .",
    "we already compensate as much as possible for this mechanism by presenting only the _ normalized _ nep .",
    "but as in the case of hard spheres , there is still the effect , that also the normalized nep are proportional to the static structure factor .",
    "this is a very nontrivial phenomenon , since the existence of negative vertices in the mode coupling functional @xmath157 could in principle lead to a violation of this correlation .",
    "but as can be inferred from fig .",
    "[ fig_nepdiag ] the nep @xmath158 for @xmath6 are systematically larger than the one for @xmath98 in a large region around the first peak of the structure factor @xmath159 , without big differences in the functional form .",
    "this effect , especially for @xmath160 where the mentioned trend is valid for all wavevectors , can be mainly understood as a consequence of the transition temperature being smaller for @xmath6 than for @xmath98 , which causes the the first peak of @xmath159 to increase .",
    "additional evidence for this reasoning is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_lco4 ] . in this figure",
    "we show the results for @xmath21 at temperature @xmath161 , obtained with fixed point method , and @xmath162 , obtained with the quasi stability criterion .",
    "the lower temperature is still in the glass ( the required accuracy i.e. the maximum difference between consecutive iterates is smaller than @xmath163 , is reached after 88 iterations ) . at the higher temperature the accuracy is first increasing as expected ( see appendix ) .",
    "but after 24 iterations it begins slowly to decrease and after 42 iterations the iterates start to converge quickly towards the solution @xmath164 .",
    "the results for the lower temperature agree , except for @xmath121 , much better with the simulation , than the one for the higher temperature .",
    "but since the deviations to the true critical nep at roughly the same number of iterations are of order @xmath165 for the higher temperature compared to order @xmath166 for the lower one , we have to conclude , that the results for the higher temperature are closer to the critical nep of the theory . the better agreement with simulations of the nep at @xmath167",
    "is a trivial consequence of the fact , that positive nep increase with decreasing temperature . due to this influence of the value of @xmath5 on the amplitude of the normalized critical nep ,",
    "we can not in general conclude that increasing the cut off @xmath3 leads to a better agreement with the simulation .",
    "it might even happen , that the agreement with simulations gets worse instead of better , if increasing the cut off would lead to a larger transition temperature .",
    "this is possible due to the existence of negative vertices in the mode coupling functional .",
    "the observed trends allow the reasonable hypothesis , that the temperature effect could be the main source for the deviations between simulation and theory .",
    "in general the main structural features in the normalized non ergodicity parameter are very well represented , but they are systematically to small for nearly all wave vectors , exactly as expected , if the theoretical transition temperature is too large .    fig .",
    "[ fig_nondiag ] demonstrates , that the theory also gives good results for the off diagonal nep .",
    "we found that @xmath168 and @xmath169 are the only important off diagonal components of the static structure factor matrix @xmath99 and nep matrix @xmath170 , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ fig_nondiag ] we therefore show the normalized nep @xmath171 .",
    "the quality of the result is even better , than for the diagonal components of the nep .",
    "the critical amplitudes are determined only up to an overall scale factor .",
    "i.e. our theoretical results can not be directly compared to the simulation results .",
    "but once we have chosen a scale factor for e.g. the amplitude @xmath172 , all other amplitudes should be multiplied with the same scale factor to compare with the simulations . in fig",
    "[ fig_hqlm](a ) we have chosen a scale factor of 200 to obtain best agreement with the normalized critical amplitude @xmath173 .",
    "the features of this component are the same as in simple glass forming systems @xcite .",
    "there is a minimum at the position of the first peak of @xmath174 .",
    "simulations and theory compare quite well for @xmath175 and show deviations at other wave vectors . with the chosen scale factors the other diagonal elements of the critical amplitude matrix show strong deviations from the simulation results .",
    "especially @xmath176 ( see fig.[fig_hqlm](b ) ) does not even disagree in amplitude but also in the form , except for the minimum at @xmath177 .",
    "this is not unexpected , since the simulations have shown strong differences between the form of the dynamic correlators involving odd and even @xmath20 @xcite . due to the weak top down anisotropy of our diatomic molecules , the dynamic of the correlators involving odd @xmath20 is only weakly coupled to the dynamics of the even components @xcite .",
    "@xmath178 jumps are still possible on a much faster time scale than the translational motion @xcite .",
    "consequently there are strong corrections to the asymptotic results for the correlator @xmath179 and the amplitude @xmath176 is not very well defined .    the deviations between simulation and theory in @xmath180 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_hqlm](c ) ) are more serious , since @xmath181 exhibits a well defined @xmath1 - relaxation regime .",
    "we can improve the agreement between simulation and theory by choosing a free scale factor for the simulation curves .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_hqlm](d ) to demonstrate , in contrast to @xmath182 , that essential structural features in @xmath183 are indeed reproduced by the theory .",
    "as argued above the dynamic correlators and therefore also the critical amplitudes involving @xmath95 are much more affected by the cut off @xmath70 as the one with lower @xmath20 .",
    "this might be the reason for the rather large discrepancy found for @xmath183 . to determine the critical amplitudes , it is necessary to be very close to the critical point .",
    "restriction in computer time did nt allow us to determine @xmath5 for @xmath6 with high enough accuracy to get reliable results for the critical amplitudes .",
    "the critical amplitudes with @xmath184 do not exhibit very much structure . in fig .",
    "[ fig_hq221 ] we show for completeness the result for @xmath185 , which could in principle be measured in light scattering experiments",
    ". again we choose an overall amplitude prefactor as a free fit parameter , but the agreement is still not very good .",
    "much better is the agreement ( similar to the nep ) for @xmath186 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_hq020 ] ) , although we still had to choose the amplitude scale of the simulation as a free fit parameter .",
    "we have performed a quantitative test of mmct for a liquid of diatomic molecules .",
    "the static structure factors from simulations were used as input for the mmct to calculate the critical temperature @xmath5 , the matrix of critical nep @xmath64 and the matrix of critical @xmath1 - relaxation amplitudes @xmath94 .",
    "several approximation schemes were used to test the sensitivity of the results against changing the degree of diagonalization of the @xmath64 in @xmath20 and @xmath187 and the dependence on the upper cut off @xmath3 . as maximum cut off ,",
    "@xmath6 was used .",
    "since the computational effort increases strongly with @xmath3 , we used a new , more accurate , method to determine the critical nep from the liquid side of the transition .    as expected , by giving up any diagonalization approximation for @xmath15 , @xmath64 and the memory functional @xmath188 all degrees of freedom vitrify at a single temperature .",
    "in fact , to obtain a unique transition temperature , it is sufficient to keep only the static structure factor @xmath15 nondiagonal in @xmath20 and @xmath187 .",
    "the strongest effect of successively applying diagonalization approximations for the nep @xmath64 and the memory functional @xmath189 is the change of the transition temperatures @xmath5 . also using different cut offs @xmath3 changes the transition temperature .",
    "contrary to @xmath5 , the overall form of nep is much less sensitive to the different approximation schemes .",
    "the agreement with simulation is qualitatively quite good for cut off @xmath3=2 as well as for @xmath3=4 . in some cases especially for the @xmath121 , @xmath190 component and the off diagonal @xmath121 , @xmath191 component of the nep",
    "the agreement is even quantitative for wavevectors around the first peak of the structure factor @xmath159 .",
    "the comparison of the nep with simulations for the correlator with ( @xmath121 , @xmath190 ) is clearly improved using the cut off @xmath6 instead of @xmath98 .",
    "other correlators are better represented for @xmath98 .",
    "we therefore can not conclude that in general a further increase of the cut off will lead necessarily to still better agreement with simulations .",
    "also the wave vector dependence of the normalized critical @xmath1-relaxation amplitudes agrees quite well with the one obtained from simulations .",
    "contrary to the prediction of mmct no common amplitude scale for the critical amplitudes with different @xmath20 and @xmath187 could be found . at present",
    "it is not clear whether this failure is real or due to the fitting procedure used in @xcite to obtain the beta relaxation amplitudes .",
    "also the restriction to cut off @xmath98 for the determination of the critical amplitudes could cause the found discrepancies , since also correlators with @xmath192 will contribute to the critical amplitudes at @xmath95 . by neglecting them an error in the amplitude scale",
    "is possible .    in summarizing our study ,",
    "we may say , that the mmct offers an overall consistent description of the glass transition in molecular liquid of diatomic molecules , at least concerning the critical nep and the critical amplitudes .",
    "if the temperature is chosen above the critical temperature , the only stable fixed point of the iteration ( [ iterate ] ) is @xmath193 .",
    "but there is still the possibility of determining the critical nep with even higher accuracy than with the converging iteration for @xmath194 . to implement the method",
    ", we have to initialize the iteration with a @xmath195 , which is close to @xmath196 , where @xmath197 is a superindex for @xmath198 and @xmath17 .",
    "this can be achieved by first using the fixed point iteration @xmath199 below @xmath5 and increasing the temperatures in small steps until the liquid regime is reached .",
    "the critical temperature will eventually be missed by a small value @xmath200 and the iteration converges after a _ long _ transient quickly to zero .",
    "since the iteration at a given temperature is always initialized with the final result of the previous temperature , the above assumption is fulfilled .",
    "the long transient is caused by the marginal stability of the critical point .",
    "the iteration will be dominated for a long time by the critical direction of the iteration , which is given by the eigenvector @xmath201 , which belongs to the eigenvalue @xmath66 of the _ critical _ stability matrix @xmath202 @xcite .",
    "the nep @xmath203 at which the iteration is almost stationary is given by minimizing the distance of the projection of @xmath204 on the critical direction @xmath205 , where for technical reasons the _ left _ critical eigenvector @xmath205 was chosen .",
    "this condition can be written as @xmath206 eq . ( [ stationary ] ) determines the quasi stationary point @xmath203 such , that matrix @xmath207 has an eigenvalue @xmath208 for @xmath209 .",
    "@xmath82 indicates that the temperature is @xmath210 .",
    "this stationary point @xmath211 differs from @xmath212 in order @xmath97 !",
    "this can be proven by using an argument analogous to deriving the @xmath1 - relaxation equation @xcite . defining @xmath213 by @xmath214 and using the property",
    "that @xmath215 is a smooth differentiable function of @xmath97 , eq .",
    "( [ stationary ] ) can be written , in leading order in @xmath216 and @xmath97 as @xmath217 here we have in addition used that @xmath218 is the left eigenvector of the stability matrix at the critical point with eigenvalue @xmath66 .",
    "the tensor @xmath219 is the partial derivative of the stability matrix with respect to @xmath220 .",
    "( [ stationary2 ] ) immediately shows , that @xmath216 is ( at least ) of order @xmath221 .",
    "note , that the argument crucially depends on the well known phenomenon , that the static quantities like structure factors , which determine completely the stability matrix @xmath222 are varying smoothly across the glass transition .",
    "we now want to estimate the number of iterations required to approach the quasi stationary point @xmath223 .",
    "for that matter the iterates @xmath224 are expanded around the quasi stationary point @xmath225 neglecting terms of order @xmath226 the iteration ( [ a1 ] ) can be rewritten as      where the quantities with @xmath228 are taken at @xmath229 .",
    "the slowing down of the iteration is due to the component of @xmath230 along the critical direction @xmath201 .",
    "this component can be extracted by writing @xmath231 and multiplying eq .",
    "( [ itexpan ] ) with the left eigenvector @xmath205 of the stability matrix @xmath232 .",
    "the resulting equation for @xmath233 is then @xmath234 here we made use of ( [ stationary ] ) and have normalized @xmath235 such that @xmath236 .",
    "the quantities @xmath237 and @xmath238 can be identified as the separation parameter and the exponent parameter @xmath239 of the @xmath1 - relaxation theory , respectively @xcite .",
    "since consecutive iterates are very close to each other in the vicinity of @xmath223 we can rewrite ( [ difference ] ) as a differential equation .",
    "@xmath240      since the iteration is initialized with a value for @xmath244 slightly in the glass , the initial deviation @xmath245 from @xmath223 is of order @xmath246 . from eq .",
    "( [ dglsol ] ) then follows , that we need a number of iteration of the order @xmath247 to approach @xmath223 ( i.e. @xmath248 ) , and will stay close to @xmath223 ( i.e. @xmath249 ) for the same amount of iterations before the iterates decay to zero .",
    "this proves our statement that the quasi stationary solution of the iteration for @xmath250 is approached with the same amount of iterations as the stable solution slightly below @xmath5 .",
    "but there the glass solution agrees with @xmath251 only up to order @xmath81 the quasistationary solution @xmath223 however agrees with @xmath251 up to order @xmath252 .",
    "99 here we always restrict ourselves to the idealized mode coupling theory , which neglects all ergodicity restoring processes like e.g. hopping .",
