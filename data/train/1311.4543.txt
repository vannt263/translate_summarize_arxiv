    "it is well known that string theory which is proclaimed as a theory of everything can only live in higher dimensions and one of the key issues , besides unification of all forces , it is supposed to address is quantum gravity .",
    "hence higher dimensional probing of gravity is quite in line with the current work in fundamental physics .",
    "the most natural higher dimensional generalization of einstein gravity is lovelock polynomial gravity @xcite which includes linear order einstein gravity for @xmath1 and quadratic gauss - bonnet ( gb ) for @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the degree of homogeneous polynomial in riemann curvature .",
    "this is the unique generalization which retains the second order character of the equation of motion , and @xmath3th order term makes non - zero contribution to the equation only in dimension @xmath4 .",
    "it is therefore truly a higher dimensional generalization .",
    "it may be noted that among others , quadratic gb term has been shown to be relevant to low energy limit of string theory @xcite .",
    "this may perhaps be indicative of the fact that high energy limit of classical gravity may be lovelock gravity .",
    "this is how one of us has argued @xcite for quite some time on purely classical motivation for higher dimensions .",
    "for inclusion of high energy effects within classical framework we should involve higher orders of riemann curvature and yet if we demand the equation to remain second order , we are uniquely led to lovelock polynomial and higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "this is how lovelock gravity may perhaps arise as high energy limit of classical gravity and hence it may serve as an intermediatory state between classical and quantum gravity @xcite . thus notwithstanding the strong string theory motivation for higher dimensional study of gravity ,",
    "the point we would like to make is that there is also equally pertinent classical motivation .",
    "further it has been argued that pure lovelock gravity imbibes one of the universal features of gravity that it is kinematical in all odd dimensions like einstein gravity is in @xmath5 dimensions @xcite .",
    "what it means is that @xmath6 implies @xmath7 in all @xmath8 dimensions .",
    "here @xmath9 is defined such that vanishing of trace of its bianchi derivative gives the same divergence free second rank symmetric tensor as that obtained from variation of @xmath3th order lovelock polynomial action @xcite .",
    "it also turns out that pure lovelock @xmath0-vacuum solution asymptotically goes over to corresponding einstein schwarzschild - ds / ads solution even though action was free of einstein term @xcite .",
    "further there is thermodynamical universality for pure lovelock static black holes , for instance entropy in even @xmath10 dimension would always go as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is area of horizon @xcite .",
    "therefore a very strong case has been made @xcite for pure lovelock equation , @xmath13 which includes only one @xmath3th order term .",
    "there exists general solution for vacuum of this equation describing static black hole @xcite . among other general features of lovelock gravity ,",
    "very recently it has also been shown that bound orbits around a static black hole exist in all even @xmath10 dimensions @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that pure lovelock equation is a classical gravitational equation relevant for @xmath14 dimensions for a given @xmath3 .",
    "it is not a correction arising out of some other theory like string theory .",
    "this is a basic difference of viewpoint in pure lovelock and einstein - lovelock theories . from this standpoint einstein gravity",
    "is relevant only for @xmath15 dimensions and similarly for @xmath16 , is gauss - bonnet , and hence there is no question of inclusion of einstein or other terms @xmath17 .",
    "we thus have only one coupling constant for one force which would be determined experimentally as @xmath18 is determined for einstein gravity . when there are more than one coupling constants , there higher order couplings arise as measure of corrections to the first order einstein gravity .",
    "pure lovelock is therefore entirely on different plane .",
    "black holes are by far the most interesting solutions of gravitational theories .",
    "hence their existence , uniqueness and stability are of utmost importance and have been intensely discussed in the literature . in higher dimensions vacuum solution with the usual spherical topology @xmath19 is static and unique @xcite .",
    "this is very important for black hole stability analysis . in this paper",
    ", we will focus on the study of stability of pure lovelock black holes with horizon having spherical topology .",
    "the linear stability was studied for @xmath20-dimensional einstein black holes .",
    "the metric perturbations are decomposed according to their transformation properties under two - dimensional rotations .",
    "they are classified by transformation under parity , namely odd ( axial ) @xcite and even ( polar ) @xcite .",
    "the two modes give rise to the same schrodinger - type differential equation for perturbations .",
    "finally stability of @xmath20-dimensional black holes has been thoroughly investigated by several authors in @xcite .",
    "in higher dimensions , there exists an additional tensor mode @xcite .",
    "following this , a gauge - invariant formalism was developed in @xcite where perturbations are decomposed into three types of gravitational variables , depending on how they transform with respect to horizon .",
    "hence we have three types of perturbations , tensor , vector and scalar .",
    "the last two types correspond , respectively , to odd and even modes in four - dimensional case while tensor perturbations are new and emerge only in higher dimensions . following",
    "the scheme proposed in @xcite , stability of higher dimensional black holes has been an active topic of research in recent years . in the case of einstein - gauss - bonnet ( egb ) gravity , stability analysis under scalar and",
    "vector perturbations was carried out in @xcite and it was later generalized to any lovelock @xcite . also tensor perturbations were studied in @xcite for egb case , then it was generalized to third order lovelock in @xcite and to any lovelock order in @xcite .",
    "it was shown @xcite that vector perturbations are stable as long as tensor perturbations are stable .",
    "also there exists an instability of lovelock black holes with small mass under tensor perturbations in even - dimensions and under scalar perturbations in odd - dimensions .",
    "it may be noted that in all odd @xmath8 dimensions , there exist analogues of @xmath5-dimensional btz black hole @xcite , and let us call them as pure lovelock odd @xmath8 dimensional black holes .",
    "then @xmath1 is the btz black hole .",
    "it is however possible to have btz - like black holes in even dimensions with a non trivial geometry of the horizon @xcite . for satability analysis we shall employ a new approach in which the stability equation directly follows from the second order of the action without the use of s - deformation method .",
    "one of the important results of our analysis is the important role played by @xmath0 in imparting stability to otherwise unstable pure lovelock black hole .",
    "this however comes at a price which makes mass of black hole bounded on either side where upper bound is dictated by existence of horizon while lower by stability .",
    "notice that we focus on the particular case of tensor perturbations , because we work in the critical even @xmath21 dimensions for pure lovelock gravity .",
    "in fact as alluded in the beginning , lovelock gravity in odd and even dimensions is radically different @xcite . also scalar perturbations do not provide an additional constraint for even dimensions @xcite hence we focus with tensor perturbations in critical even @xmath21 dimensions .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we give the basic lovelock formulation which is followed by recall of static black holes solutions in sec .",
    "3 . in sec . 4",
    ", we present the ishibashi - kodama formalism and derive the master equation for tensor perturbations and discuss stability by using s - deformation technique , and in sec .",
    "5 we derive the same equation by expanding action in second order which also gives us no - ghost condition without use of s - deformation . in sec . 6",
    ", we obtain the upper bound on black hole mass in terms of @xmath0 as a condition for existence of a horizon .",
    "next we consider stability of pure lovelock even and odd dimensions in sec .",
    "7 and of dimensionally continued black holes in sec .",
    "8 . in sec .",
    "9 we compare stability of einstein , einstein - gauss - bonnet , dimensionally continued and pure lovelock black holes and the paper is rounded off by discussion .",
    "we consider the lagrangian in d dimensions    @xmath22    where we define the maximum integer @xmath23 $ ] , @xmath24 are arbitrary constants which represent the couplings and @xmath25 is given by    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the riemann tensor and @xmath28 is the generalized kronecker delta of order @xmath29 . in the following , we use @xmath30 as generic indices , whereas @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "we consider spacetime of the following form that implies @xmath33 @xmath34 with @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the metric of the @xmath32-dimensional constant curvature space with a curvature @xmath37 or @xmath38 .",
    "the vacuum equation then reduces to solving the master algebraic equation @xcite @xmath39 here the coefficients @xmath40 are given by @xmath41 @xmath42 is a constant of integration related to the mass by @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the area of a unit @xmath45-sphere ( @xmath32 ) , @xmath18 denotes the @xmath46-dimensional newton constant and @xmath47 is the arnowitt - deser - misner mass .",
    "in higher dimensions , perturbations can be decomposed into scalar , vector and tensor modes according to how they transform under @xmath48 @xcite . in @xmath49",
    ", a vector perturbation corresponds to axial ( odd ) mode while scalar perturbation corresponds to polar ( even ) mode . finally , an additional tensor mode is present in dimensions @xmath50 as there are no suitable tensor harmonics in @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "here we study tensor perturbations around solution ( [ eq : metric ] ) of the form ,    @xmath51    where @xmath52 unless @xmath53 , and    @xmath54    here @xmath55 is a tt tensor ( traceless - transverse ) with respect to the metric @xmath36 , solving the eigenvalue problem    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is covariant derivative with respect to @xmath36 and @xmath58 .",

    "hence we write    @xmath69    after setting @xmath70 , which is possible because the background is static ( we use the separation of variables and integrate over time ) , @xmath71 gives    @xmath72    by further introducing @xmath73 for @xmath74 ( or @xmath75 for @xmath76 ) and switching to `` tortoise '' coordinate @xmath77 , defined by @xmath78 , we can rewrite the previous equation in the shrdinger form with `` energy '' eigenvalue @xmath79 ,    @xmath80    where potential is given by ,    @xmath81    and @xmath82 is a differential operator in the hilbert space of square integrable functions",
    ". the solution will be perturbatively stable if and only if the differential operator @xmath83 acting on functions defined in the region @xmath84 is a positive self - adjoint operator , so that it has no negative eigenvalues @xmath85 .",
    "in fact let us suppose that we have an unstable mode with @xmath86 which means @xmath87 , hence we have    @xmath88    where integration is defined in the region @xmath84 and we performed a partial integration .",
    "if potential is positive , this leads to a contradiction because left - hand side is negative while right - hand side is positive .",
    "thus mode is stable if potential is positive .",
    "in contrast , if potential is negative , we can not conclude anything about stability .",
    "for that , the equation has to be further analysed by using \" s - deformation ",
    "technique @xcite .",
    "this deformation is useful for transforming a partly negative potential to a positive - definite one .",
    "we have    @xmath89    where @xmath90 and @xmath91 is `` s - deformation '' function to be defined .",
    "hence as shown in @xcite and by choosing    @xmath92    gives    @xmath93    the `` new '' potential depends linearly on the factor @xmath94 which is positive and can be very large .",
    "for example when @xmath95 , we have @xmath96 which can be sufficiently large for high harmonics @xmath97 .    in the case where @xmath98 deformed potential @xmath99 is positive which implies stability of the solution . while if @xmath100 potential can be sufficiently negative for high harmonics and therefore eqn .",
    "( [ eq : def ] ) will be negative .",
    "hence there is existence of unstable modes with negative energy states ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "because potential can be as negative as desired , we can always find a negative mode solution that is normalizable .",
    "a sufficient condition of the instability is @xmath102 @xcite , which is trivially satisfied for high harmonics .",
    "thus stability can be read from the sign of deformed potential @xmath99 which implies that the spacetime is stable iff @xmath98 on the domain of definition @xmath84 .",
    "in this section , we adopt another approach , by expanding action at second order of perturbations . it is more convenient from a computational point of view and gives easily the conditions for the avoidance of ghosts and laplacian instabilities .",
    "the approach has been widely used for the stability analysis of various spacetimes , starting with the seminal work for the schwarzschild spacetime @xcite , see also the same approach in the context of modified gravity @xcite or cosmology @xcite .",
    "the relevant formulae are given in appendix .",
    "after some lengthy calculations , we have for action on shell    @xmath103 \\bar h_i^{~j } \\bar h_j^{~i}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from which , we can derive no ghost condition as @xmath74 .",
    "hence a ghost mode is always present around spherically symmetric static background in vacuum if @xmath76 .",
    "however existence of ghost does not necessarily imply instability if mode is massive enough .",
    "in fact , theory might be considered as valid below some cutoff scale and should be completed at higher energies .",
    "therefore if mass of ghost mode is larger than a cutoff scale @xmath104 ( let us say @xmath105 ) , instability can be disregarded .",
    "but in this particular case , we will have instability at least for monopole perturbation @xmath106 which is massless .",

    "hence we can deduce positivity of @xmath99 without using `` s - deformation '' . defining new variable @xmath107 , and switching to the tortoise",

    "in this paper we have derived the master equation for tensor perturbations of black holes in any order lovelock theory , namely , in any dimensions , by expanding action to second order of perturbations .",
    "hence we have derived no - ghost and tachyonic stability conditions for a spherically symmetric solution in lovelock gravity .",
    "the relevant perturbation defining function @xmath229 must be positive to avoid a ghost and @xmath217 to have stability of black hole ( tachyonic instability ) .",
    "we apply this stability analysis to pure lovelock theory in even @xmath10 dimensions .",
    "it turns out that pure lovelock black hole spacetime is always unstable unless @xmath0 is brought in .",
    "@xmath0 therefore plays a stabilizing role for even dimensional pure lovelock black holes , and stability is achieved by prescribing a lower bound on its mass while an upper bound on mass comes from existence of horizon .",
    "the latter is derived by using the standard theorems of resultant for the polynomial @xmath230 .",
    "thus black hole mass is bounded on either ends .    intuitively lower and upper mass bounds could perhaps be understood as follows : without @xmath0 , pure lovelock black hole for @xmath192 is always unstable .",
    "note that gravitational potential for pure lovelock black hole goes as @xmath231 which is weaker than einstein potential going as @xmath232 .",
    "now when @xmath0 is introduced which implies repulsion going as @xmath233 and it effectively defines instability threshold radius which could be pushed inside black hole horizon if it is sufficiently massive . this is how the lower mass threshold comes about .",
    "the presence of @xmath0 would however always define upper threshold for mass in all cases , even for einstein gravity ( see also @xcite ) .    for einstein gravity",
    ", there is always stability and so is also the case for odd dimensional ( btz - like ) pure lovelock black hole .",
    "the latter however has no central singularity , it essentially means that ds - like space is stable under tensor perturbations but it may not be stable for scalar perturbations . in particular , @xmath234-dimensional pure gb black hole is stable for @xmath223 .",
    "there also exists a lower mass bound for stability of e - gb black hole . in the case of dimensionally",
    "continued black holes , even dimensional ones are unstable while for odd dimensional ones , @xmath204 , and hence they are neutral for tensor perturbations .    in einstein - lovelock theory , there are as many coupling constants as the degree of polynomial @xmath3 which can not be determined . since there is only one force which can determine only one coupling constant .",
    "hence besides @xmath0 , which is a constant of spacetime structure @xcite , there should only be one free coupling .",
    "this is what is done in pure lovelock gravity while for dimensionally continued case all couplings are related to the unique vacuum defined by @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "then dimensionally continued black holes are unstable while pure lovelock ones could be made stable by @xmath0 . if stability is the determining criterion , pure lovelock black holes score over dimensionally continued ones .",
    "we thus have a remarkably interesting result for pure lovelock black holes that existence of horizon and stability bounds its mass between two upper and lower thresholds ; i.e. @xmath235 .",
