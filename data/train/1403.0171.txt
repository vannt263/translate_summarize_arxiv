    "until relatively recently , the question of classifying black holes seemed resolved , with birkhoff s theorem @xcite and uniqueness theorems of israel s for schwarzschild @xcite and reissner - nrdstrom @xcite black holes . this lead to wheeler s so - called ` no - hair ' conjecture @xcite , which placed limits of the kinds of black holes one could expect in spherically symmetric space ( and specifically the very small number of parameters which must entirely specify the solution ) .",
    "however , in the 1980s and since , more and more examples have been found which show that the conjecture is violated in the strictest terms , beginning with the discovery of black hole and soliton solutions in 4d flat spacetime ; in the case of scalar hair by bekenstein and others ( e.g. @xcite ) , and for @xmath6 hair by bizon , bartnik , mckinnon and others ( e.g. @xcite ) . since then , many other directions of research in this area have been pursued ( see for instance @xcite for a review . )    introducing a non - zero cosmological constant is known to yield very interesting results , due to the differing geometry it bestows upon the manifold . in asymptotically flat space , soliton and black hole solutions of @xmath7 eym theory",
    "are known to exist only at discrete points in the parameter space .",
    "all such solutions will have a gauge field function @xmath8 with at least one zero , the number of unstable modes of the solution being directly proportional to the number of zeroes of @xmath8 ( @xmath9 unstable modes for @xmath10 zeroes @xcite ) .",
    "however , for anti - de sitter ( ads ) space ( i.e. a negative cosmological constant ) , it changes completely ; we get solutions existing in continuous ranges of the parameters governing the dynamic variables @xcite , and at least some of them possess gauge fields with no zeroes ( so - called ` nodeless ' solutions ) . it can be shown that some of the solutions with non - zero gauge fields everywhere are stable under linear perturbations @xcite , provided that @xmath11 is large enough .",
    "( we shall leave the question of @xmath12 entirely , except to say that for a comprehensive classification of constructed asymptotically de sitter spacetimes , see @xcite . )",
    "recent research has expanded upon this , and the existence has been established of asymptotically anti - de sitter soliton and black hole solutions to 4d @xmath0 eym equations @xcite .",
    "purely magnetic solutions have been found which are described by @xmath3 gauge field functions @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the most recent results we have @xcite show that there exist genuinely non - trivial solutions for any @xmath2 where the gauge field functions have no zeroes , and that for @xmath11 sufficiently large , at least some of these are stable @xcite .",
    "these hairy black holes in ads , despite being indistinguishable from reissner - nrdstrom black holes asymptotically , therefore require an extra @xmath3 parameters to describe them , and this number is obviously unbounded ( though still countable ) as @xmath15 . for more detail , see the recent work @xcite , in which there do seem to be global charges characterising at least some of the stable @xmath0 solutions .",
    "some work from van der bij and radu @xcite ( among others ) has suggested a whole new direction in which to take these ` hairy ' black holes .",
    "their work is on topological black holes  that is , black holes that possess isometries other than the usual requirement of spherical symmetry .",
    "this will be expanded upon later , but briefly , the requirement is no longer that the metric and gauge potential are _ spherically _ symmetric ( i.e. endow the manifold with gauge fields that are invariant under an action of @xmath16 by principal bundle automorphisms ) ; it is relaxed to encompass other isometry groups such that the lie group of isometries is the structure group of one of the three surfaces of constant curvature ",
    "i.e. , the sphere , the plane , or a hyperbolic surface ( with the possibilities of event horizons of non - zero genus ) .",
    "several authors have also considered various other cases of topological black holes , including those set in higher dimensions and with event horizons of genus @xmath17 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this work @xcite yielded interesting results for @xmath6 : the authors found topological black hole solutions numerically ; noted that the yang - mills field equation could be cast in a form in which it was obvious that all solutions would be nodeless ; and demonstrated their stability under linear spherically symmetric perturbations for @xmath11 sufficiently large .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to build on their successes ( though using largely different methods ) by generalising their results to @xmath0 ; and thus to prove    1 .",
    "that , for @xmath4 , solutions exist for arbitrary values of the initial parameters of the field variables at the event horizon which are regular everywhere and which are analytic in their parameters , and 2 .   that genuine ( i.e. non - trivial ) solutions to the 4d @xmath0 eym field equations with a negative cosmological constant can be found in a neighbourhood of known ( trivial ) solutions and , for @xmath18 , these solutions will be nodeless i.e. will possess gauge field functions with no zeroes .",
    "the results for @xmath19 ( which correspond to spherical symmetry ) have been adequately explored in @xcite , and so will largely be ignored except as comparison to the new results we obtain for @xmath18 . also , we note that here we use a time - honoured ` shooting ' method to verify the existence of solutions , though this is not the only method : recent work by nolan and winstanley @xcite uses an argument involving banach spaces to prove the existence of dyons and dyonic black holes in spherically symmetric @xmath6 theory .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "first , we present the anstze , field equations and boundary conditions for 4d @xmath0 eym theory with a negative cosmological constant .",
    "we use the work of wang @xcite and knzle @xcite to derive a new , more general @xmath1-invariant gauge potential which applies to the topologies we are interested in .",
    "some trivial solutions to the field equations are found , including reissner - nrdstrom - type and embedded @xmath6 solutions , both of which are vital to the final existence argument .",
    "next we prove a series of propositions : we demonstrate that solutions exist locally nearby the singular points of the field equations ( that is , @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) ; and that solutions which are regular in some small interval within @xmath22 can continue to be integrated outwards to the asymptotic regime provided the metric function @xmath23 .",
    "we note that such solutions will be analytic in their initial values at the event horizon .",
    "we then use these propositions to prove a theorem which states that topological @xmath0 solutions will always exist in open sets , and that solutions in a sufficiently small neighbourhood of each other will possess the same number of gauge field zeroes .",
    "finally we establish our two main results : that non - trivial solutions to these field equations exist both for fixed values of the boundary conditions @xmath24 and for @xmath4 , and also in some small neighbourhood of reissner - nrdstrom - type solutions for any fixed @xmath5 .",
    "the conclusions are presented at the end along with an indication of future directions this work may take .",
    "in this section we give a brief review of the three different topological cases of 2-dimensional spaces of constant gaussian curvature @xmath25 ( i.e. spherical , planar and hyperboloidal ) , including a discussion of the metrics and the lie groups which describe the symmetries of the spaces .",
    "we begin with a manifold @xmath26 endowed with a metric , possessing some symmetries of its own ; and wish to endow it with fields possessing some other symmetry group @xmath27 . we can consider it as a principal fibre bundle , i.e. with base space @xmath26 and @xmath27-valued fibres ; and endow that bundle with a connection which possesses the property that it is invariant under any isometric action ( automorphism ) performed on it . in the case of spherical symmetry",
    ", such an action would be a rotation around a general axis .",
    "it can be noted that each such action can be mapped to the ( continuous ) rotation group @xmath28  as such , this is associated with the @xmath29 subalgebra . in the case of a sphere , the collection of all these actions form orbit surfaces which in the trivial case are clearly spheres @xmath30 , which regularly foliate the 4-manifold .",
    "the whole group of isometries is isomorphic to @xmath16 .    in the case of a general space of constant curvature ,",
    "we find that the @xmath28 subgroup is still present in @xmath31 ( the general name we are giving to the lie group of isometries of the 2d constant - curvature manifold in question ) , and since the collection of all possible actions of @xmath31 regularly foliates the 4-manifold in question , then the isometries are classified by all possible actions of @xmath31 on a principal @xmath27-bundle . in order to generalise the above statements , and the arguments that follow it in the original paper by knzle @xcite , to @xmath18",
    ", we will need appropriate replacements for the subspace @xmath30 and the lie group of isometries @xmath16",
    ". then we will have a way forward when it comes to constructing the gauge potential , in order to give the gauge fields the correct symmetry .",
    "hence , in what shortly follows we shall briefly explain what we mean by surfaces of constant curvature , categorising them by the sign of the gaussian curvature , and showing the appropriate topology and lie algebra we use in each case .",
    "as is well known , the metric for the sphere of unit radius is given by @xmath32 the symmetry group is also well known , as the lie group @xmath16 , with the associated lie algebra @xmath6 .",
    "the most common representation of this algebra is to use the well - known _ pauli matrices _ , i.e. :    @xmath33    to obtain the three generators .",
    "it should be noted that the lie group @xmath16 forms a double cover of the lie group @xmath34 ; thus , the three generators of the algebra @xmath6 can be mapped to the three ( infinitesimal ) basis vectors for ordinary 3-dimensional euclidean spatial rotations .",
    "if we let @xmath35 with @xmath36 , then the @xmath37 obey the following commutation relations : @xmath38=k_3 & \\quad & [ k_2,k_3]=k_1 & \\quad & [ k_3,k_1]=k_2 . \\end{array}\\ ] ]    as well as using the pauli matrices as a basis , we can use the following definitions of infinitesimal differential operators to satisfy the commutators : @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 can be mapped to ordinary @xmath34 rotations about the @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 axes .",
    "the metric for a 2d plane can be given as the following : @xmath47 the isometry group for the 2d plane is just the ordinary 2d euclidean lie group @xmath48 , with associated lie algebra @xmath49 .",
    "the lie group @xmath48 has three generators : two spatial translations and one rotation .",
    "the basis for this is most helpfully taken as infinitesimal translations in the @xmath43 and the @xmath44 directions , which for later convenience we call @xmath50 and @xmath51 ; and the rotation in the @xmath52 plane , for which we use the name @xmath53 .",
    "the commutation relations for @xmath49 are then : @xmath54=0 , & \\quad & [ k_2,k_3]=k_1 , & \\quad & [ k_3,k_1]=k_2 . \\end{array}\\ ] ] unfortunately , the isometries of @xmath55 can not be given explicitly in terms of matrices under multiplication  the closest we can get is the set of transforms @xmath56 for a translation in the plane by the vector @xmath57 and a rotation by an angle @xmath58 .",
    "so the best representation for this algebra can be given in terms of the following correspondence to differential operators : @xmath59 these are just the ordinary killing vectors for 2-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "the analogous negatively curved space is endowed with the metric @xmath61 where @xmath62 is regarded as the metric on the sphere of unit imaginary radius , i.e. the unit hyperboloid .",
    "the symmetry group on the space can be shown to be the lie group @xmath63 , associated with the lie algebra @xmath64 .",
    "the lie algebra @xmath64 again has 3 infinitesimal generators which we call @xmath37 for @xmath36 ; and can be cast in the form where they have the following commutation relations ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath65=-k_3 , & \\quad & [ k_2,k_3]=k_1 , & \\quad & [ k_3,k_1]=k_2 . \\end{array}\\ ] ] a representation for this can be given in terms of the following matrices : @xmath66 note that @xmath53 is identical to the definition of @xmath53 for the spherical case  this is no coincidence and will be discussed below .      in all 3 cases , giving the appropriate symmetry ( @xmath16 , @xmath48 or @xmath63 ) to the 4d manifold requires that they be considered regularly foliated by 2d surfaces of constant curvature ( which we shall call @xmath67 ) that are appropriate to the case in question , endowing them with the topology @xmath68 .    in the case of the sphere ( for @xmath19 ) , it is clear that @xmath69 , and it can be shown that @xmath70 . @xmath16 as a manifold is topologically the 3-sphere @xmath71 , and the quotient is taken using @xmath28 ( which is the circle @xmath72 ) . to form this quotient",
    "we can use the fact that the abelian subgroup of diagonal matrices is isomorphic to the circle group @xmath28 , so we let the generator @xmath73 span the @xmath29 subalgebra  the reason for this identification is to simplify the later derivation of the gauge potential .",
    "in the case of the flat plane @xmath74 ( for @xmath46 ) , the quotient works slightly differently : since @xmath75 is a normal subgroup of @xmath48 but @xmath76 is not , we find that @xmath77 ( through the usual map that associates to an affine transformation a linear transformation of the tangent vector space associated to the affine space ) .",
    "again though , @xmath78 , and we let the generator @xmath53 ( in this case , the rotation generator ) span the @xmath29 subalgebra . with this identification",
    "the remaining two generators ( the translations ) span the @xmath75 plane . using the geometrical construction given above ,",
    "it can be seen how this continues over from the spherical case , with the @xmath45-axis rotation generator being @xmath53 in both cases .",
    "one can even consider the above spherical case , and simply let the radius of the sphere go to infinity ; in that case , the rotation about the @xmath43- and @xmath44-axes become the @xmath44 and @xmath43 translation generators respectively and the rotation generator stays as it is .    for the hyperbolic space @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .",
    "thus , although it is harder to visualise , we have essentially a similar situation as for @xmath19 : one of the generators ( @xmath53 ) is of an ordinary rotation type , and it is this generator that we use to span the subalgebra @xmath29 in the quotient .",
    "the other two generators will be hyperbolic rotations on the space @xmath81 .",
    "it can be seen from the previous subsection that we could express this information in a much simpler way , exploiting the three values we have chosen for @xmath10 . examining ( [ k1met ] , [ k0met ] ,",
    "[ k - met ] ) , the metric in all the above cases can be expressed as @xmath82 where @xmath83 examining ( [ k1cr ] , [ k0cr ] , [ k - cr ] ) , we can also express the commutation relations of the three lie algebras in the following succinct way : @xmath84=kk_3 & \\quad & [ k_2,k_3]=k_1 & \\quad & [ k_3,k_1]=k_2 \\end{array}\\ ] ] with the algebra ( which we call @xmath85 in general ) being @xmath6 for @xmath19 , @xmath49 for @xmath46 and @xmath64 for @xmath60 ; and where the three generators of the group are the three @xmath37s .",
    "it can be noted that in each of the three cases above , @xmath53 in particular takes a similar form : it has an identical representation each time in the form of differential operators , and thus represents in each case a rotation which can easily be arranged about the same axis ( essentially @xmath45 ) .",
    "the significance of this in later sections is linked to the presence of the factor of @xmath10 which accompanies the @xmath53 generator above .",
    "finally , we can also give the topology of the foliated hypersurfaces @xmath67 as @xmath86 for @xmath87 and @xmath88 for @xmath46 ; and the topology of the 4d manifolds themselves as @xmath89 where @xmath31 is the lie group in question , and where it is understood that the generator @xmath53 ( as noted above ) plays a privileged role in forming this quotient .",
    "these facts , and equations ( [ genmet ] , [ gencr ] ) will be useful when later we derive the gauge potential using a proof analogous to that of knzle @xcite , and when we derive the field equations themselves .",
    "in this section we give the general mathematical background we shall need to describe and model topological black holes .",
    "the discussion proper will begin with a detailed outline of our metric and gauge potential anstze .",
    "this will include a full derivation of the gauge potential in this case , since this is a fairly technical procedure .",
    "these anstze will then be used to derive the field equations and boundary conditions for the topological black hole solutions . finally , we describe some trivial embedded solutions of the theory ( in analogy with @xcite ) . +      the action used for the four - dimensional @xmath0 eym theory with a negative cosmological constant is @xmath90,\\ ] ] where @xmath91 is the ricci scalar of the geometry and @xmath92 is the cosmological constant . throughout the paper",
    "the metric has signature @xmath93 and we use units in which @xmath94 . in this paper , we focus on @xmath5 . varying the action",
    "gives the field equations @xmath95\\\\ \\end{split}\\ ] ] where the ym stress - energy tensor is @xmath96 and where it should be noted that ` tr ' represents the trace in the lie algebra sense , rather than the ordinary matrix trace . in equations ( [ origfe ] , [ origymseten ] ) we have employed the usual einstein summation convention where it is understood that summation occurs over repeated indices .",
    "however where appropriate , summations will be shown explicitly .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in static , topological black hole solutions of the field equations , specifically for spaces regularly foliated by 2d ( spacelike ) hypersurfaces of constant and unit- or zero - magnitude gaussian curvature @xmath10 , and hence ( following the last section ) we write the metric in standard schwarzschild co - ordinates as @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 depend on @xmath100 alone . for convenience , we may take @xmath101 note the presence of our modified gaussian curvature constant @xmath10 .",
    "we emphasise again that in our case , @xmath5 ; and that the @xmath19 case has been thoroughly investigated in our previous work @xcite , and so will be passed over more quickly and mainly used for comparison to the other cases .",
    "the most general gauge potential we used in the spherically symmetric case was @xcite : @xmath102d\\phi,\\ ] ] where @xmath103 and @xmath104 are all ( @xmath105 ) matrices and @xmath106 is the hermitian conjugate of @xmath107 ; the matrices @xmath108 and @xmath109 are purely imaginary , diagonal and traceless and depend only on @xmath100 ; the matrix @xmath107 ( which also depends solely on @xmath100 ) is upper - triangular , with non - zero entries only immediately above the diagonal , i.e. : @xmath110 for @xmath14 ; and @xmath104 is the constant matrix @xmath111 however in the cases @xmath112 we must alter slightly to take into account the different geometry . the new gauge potential becomes @xmath113d\\phi,\\ ] ] with the same definitions for the matrices as above , and including @xmath114 ( from ) and its first derivative .",
    "we shall now demonstrate that this is an appropriate choice of potential , given the symmetry considerations , by using an argument analogous to one due to knzle in @xcite .",
    "the gauge potential for any system is never unique ( see e.g. @xcite ) . by definition",
    "it is invariant under the action of some group , so it always has freedom under transformations within that group ( automorphisms ) ; therefore it is merely a case of finding one invariant under actions of the requisite symmetry group that fulfills the appropriate gauge constraints  we shall show that is such a potential .",
    "the procedure to find _ all _ such irreducible representations can be found in @xcite .",
    "following on from section [ 2dcc ] , we now present the derivation of the gauge potential in the case of general @xmath10 .",
    "the similarity in the derivations for the three values of @xmath10 is such that we can talk very generally about the lie groups / algebras we are using , as long as we are using one of the three we have specified ; so we shall talk about the lie algebra @xmath85 , realising that this will either mean @xmath6 , @xmath49 or @xmath64 as appropriate .",
    "what we wish to do is find the possible @xmath31-invariant connections on an @xmath115 principal bundle @xmath116 over our spacetime manifold @xmath26 ; i.e. find a gauge potential that is invariant under an action of @xmath31 by principal bundle automorphisms .",
    "according to wang s theorem @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , the @xmath31-invariant connections on @xmath116 are in one - to - one correspondence with the linear maps @xmath117 satisfying @xmath118 for @xmath119 , @xmath120 being the homomorphism @xmath121 and @xmath122 the induced map of the lie algebras . also , we have @xmath123 now ,",
    "because @xmath16 and @xmath63 have nice succinct matrix representations , but @xmath48 does not , that means that we have to treat the cases for @xmath124 very slightly differently to the case @xmath46 , but the differences are largely technical . in practice ,",
    "all it really means is that we keep track of which representation we are using and exactly what is meant by ` commutator brackets ' when they appear  whether they represent the obvious matrix commutator , or are the more abstract commutator relationships possessed by any lie algebra .",
    "following @xcite , let @xmath125 , defined in terms of the general generators referred to in , be a basis for @xmath85 ( i.e. , for @xmath19 let @xmath126 ; for @xmath60 let them be the matrices in ; and for @xmath46 let them be the more abstract differential operators ) . in particular ,",
    "let the rotation generator @xmath53 in each case span the @xmath29 subalgebra . note that this associates @xmath53 with the matrix @xmath127 for the cases of @xmath124 , and for the case of @xmath46 , with the differential operator stated in @xmath128 now we need a map embedding @xmath28 isomorphically in @xmath31 . as was stated in @xcite , the map @xmath129 embeds @xmath28 isomorphically in @xmath16 .",
    "hence , the homomorphisms described by are explicitly given as @xmath130 ( for sets of @xmath2 integers @xmath131 such that @xmath132 , conjugate homomorphisms being described by different orderings of the @xmath131s ) ; and the induced map of lie algebras is given as @xmath133 where @xmath134 obviously we now need to produce analogous maps for @xmath18 .",
    "the reason it works in the @xmath19 case is that we can express a general element of @xmath16 as the matrix @xmath135 for some choice of @xmath136 for which @xmath137 ; and then if we let @xmath138 and @xmath139 , we find that the matrix specified in is indeed in @xmath16 , and it reduces infinitesimally to the rotation generator @xmath53 .",
    "it is for a similar reason that the same map can also be used in the case @xmath60 , since a general element of @xmath63 can be expressed as @xmath140 for some choice of @xmath136 for which @xmath141 ; and then if we again let @xmath138 and @xmath139 , we find that the matrix specified in is also in @xmath63 , and again it reduces infinitesimally to @xmath53 .    for @xmath46 , it is slightly different , since we are working with @xmath53 as a differential operator .",
    "however we are still identifying @xmath53 with the rotation generator of the space .",
    "so , given that @xmath142 , we instead simply use the map @xmath143 where @xmath144 refers to the rotation generator of @xmath48 ( expressed explicitly in ) .",
    "this is a map that embeds @xmath28 isomorphically in @xmath48 , so that once again @xmath130 and @xmath133 , as in",
    ". we note that infinitesimally , @xmath144 can be expressed as the differential operator , which we associate again with the generator @xmath53 , since it obeys the correct commutation laws .    defining @xmath145 , then @xmath146 and",
    "infinitesimally ( i.e. where @xmath147 $ ] ) becomes @xmath148)=-(i/2)[d_{q_i},\\pi_l]\\ ] ] where in the second step we have let @xmath149 since this generator is spanning the @xmath150 subalgebra , and hence we replace the map @xmath120 with the induced map @xmath151 ; and where the square bracketed expression on the right hand sides ( but not the left ) are the ordinary matrix commutators which necessitates a slightly different treatment of the map embedding @xmath28 in @xmath16 . for @xmath124 ,",
    "the square brackets on the left of , i.e. the abstract commutator relations , become the ordinary matrix commutator in the case that the representation used is the matrix representation given in terms of either the pauli matrices ( for @xmath19 ) or the matrices shown in ( for @xmath60 ) . for @xmath46 however , the square brackets refer to the more abstract commutator , as defined in , acting on the differential expressions . ] . ) using the commutation relations , we find that @xmath152 , & \\quad &   \\pi_2=-(i/2)[d_{q_i},\\pi_1 ] . \\end{array}\\ ] ] substituting the second of those expressions into the first gives us @xmath153,\\ ] ] from which it is easy to see that @xmath154 . given this , and since the @xmath155 are traceless and anti - hermitian ( and assuming that @xmath156 for @xmath157 ) , we can deduce that @xmath158 where @xmath107 is ( as previously described ) an upper triangular complex @xmath105 matrix with hermitian conjugate @xmath106 and where @xmath159 iff @xmath160 according to the second part of wang s theorem , the curvature 2-form of this invariant connection on the two - dimensional subspace is given by @xmath161 - \\pi([x , y])\\ ] ] where @xmath162 , and @xmath163 and @xmath164 are the corresponding generators of @xmath116  since @xmath165 here refers purely to the angular part of the gauge potential 1-form @xmath166 , then @xmath167 represents the curvature 2-form on the bundle itself restricted to the angular part .",
    "therefore , we find @xmath168 - \\pi\\left([k_1,k_2]\\right).\\ ] ]    substituting in the forms for @xmath169 and @xmath170 given in , and noting from that ( since @xmath155 is a linear map ) @xmath171 ) = -(i/2)kd_{q_i}\\ ] ] we find that the curvature is given as @xmath172-kd)\\ ] ] with other components vanishing .",
    "however , since the curvature is a tensorial form it must be the pullback of a scalar multiple of the area element of the 2-space we are working with ( sphere , plane or hyperboloid ) , which we have already described metrically using the function @xmath114 .",
    "that is , the angular component of the full 4d curvature must be of the form @xmath173 ( in the @xmath174 co - ordinate system appropriate to the space in question . )",
    "this gives us the equation @xmath175=\\tilde{f}f_k(\\theta)d\\theta\\wedge d\\phi.\\ ] ] now we are ready to construct the angular part of the connection , i.e. the local potential @xmath176 , an @xmath0 valued one - form on the two dimensional subspace .",
    "we can easily check that is satisfied by the potential @xmath177 . \\end{array}\\ ] ] a helpful relation in showing this is @xmath178 note that the presence of the @xmath179 term is due to the fact that the curvature must be the pullback of a tensorial form and hence we end up with a logarithmic derivative , evident when we take the @xmath114 out of the square brackets in @xmath180 .",
    "finally , we augment the potential with @xmath181 and @xmath100 components , which we may do easily due to the product topology of the whole 4-manifold , such that @xmath182 where the forms of @xmath108 and @xmath109 are given in the next subsection .    hence we have confirmed our ansatz for the gauge potential .",
    "as we noted , the gauge potential is never unique since there are degrees of freedom left over in the structure equations ",
    "there are many other possible forms , including witten s @xcite  but it is enough that we have found a manifestly @xmath115 invariant gauge potential that satisfies the structural constraint .",
    "another approach that can be taken is to use the symmetry equations for the lie algebra in question , as in @xcite .",
    "we now outline a way of constructing an irreducible representation of @xmath0 @xcite with reference to the previously derived gauge potential .",
    "we first consider @xmath108 and @xmath109 to be general imaginary diagonal and traceless matrices which can be written in the form @xmath183 for real functions @xmath184 , @xmath185 .",
    "we also recall that the form of the diagonal matrix @xmath104 is specified uniquely , given the equation , i.e. @xmath186    the form of the matrices @xmath107 ( and hence @xmath106 ) were also determined in the previous section ( [ cdef ] , [ ddef ] ) .",
    "now , we can simplify the field equations considerably :    1 .   for purely magnetic solutions",
    ", we must set @xmath187 ( as opposed to the cases where dyons are considered ",
    "see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "due to gauge freedom , we may set @xmath188 as well .",

    "the last item also gives us a final form for @xmath107  the only non - zero elements , indexed by @xmath190 , are    @xmath191    the details of this derivation are given in @xcite .",
    "the yang - mills equations with a cosmological constant thus take the form : @xmath192 where @xmath193,\\\\ w_{k , j}&=k-\\omega^2_j+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\omega^2_{j-1}+\\omega^2_{j+1}\\right ) , \\end{split}\\ ] ] and the einstein equations",
    "take the form @xmath194 and @xmath195 where @xmath196 it can readily be checked that these reduce in the correct limit ",
    "see equations ( 6 , 7 , 8) in @xcite .",
    "we can note several things .    1 .",
    "from now on , we assume that all the @xmath197 are in general non - zero so that we are dealing with genuinely @xmath0 solutions ( see , for example , @xcite for the consequences of violating this assumption in the @xmath198 case ) .",
    "2 .   for later convenience ,",
    "we have also introduced @xmath199 .",
    "we define @xmath200 , so that ( [ fesunkom ] , [ fesunkmpr ] , [ fesunkd ] ) reduce to the @xmath6 equations in the correct limit ( see below ) .",
    "4 .   as in the purely @xmath19 case",
    ", there are two symmetries respected by the anstze .",
    "firstly the mapping @xmath201 is an invariant mapping separately for each @xmath202 , and secondly the substitution @xmath203 for all @xmath202 is a symmetry .",
    "finally we note that , since the einstein equation for @xmath99 decouples from the rest , it can be integrated separately once we know the character of the metric function @xmath98 and the gauge field functions @xmath13 , to give the solution @xmath204 for some arbitrary constant @xmath205 .",
    "so the @xmath2 functions on which we will concentrate are @xmath98 and the @xmath13s .    for completeness",
    ", we shall show what forms these equations take for the simplest non - trivial case , @xmath6 .",
    "in this case , there is one gauge field function which we call @xmath8 , and the following functions simplify considerably : @xmath206 this means the field equations become the single equation @xmath207 and the field equations ( [ fesunkmpr ] , [ fesunkd ] ) become @xmath208 the existence of exact solutions to these @xmath6 equations will be necessary later in our constructive proof of the existence of non - trivial solutions to the @xmath0 equations .",
    "we are interested in black hole solutions to the field equations ( [ fesunkom ] , [ fesunkmpr ] , [ fesunkd ] ) , but these equations are singular at the event horizon @xmath20 and as @xmath21 .",
    "( since @xmath5 , there is no cosmological horizon to consider . )",
    "a first step is to derive the boundary conditions at these singular points .",
    "local existence has been proven already in @xmath0 eym theory for the cases @xmath198 @xcite and for @xmath5 with spherical symmetry ( @xmath19 ) @xcite ; our intention is to extend these results to @xmath18 .",
    "we are ignoring solitons , the particle - like solutions to the equations which possess no event horizon and so continue to be regular in the limit @xmath209 .",
    "( see @xcite among others , for a discussion of these in the literature . )",
    "the ricci curvature scalar @xmath210 ( for @xmath211 the ricci tensor ) is complicated , but always involves the terms : @xmath212 where the ellipses refer to terms involving @xmath213 , @xmath99 and their derivatives .",
    "hence , only for @xmath19 is the curvature non - singular at @xmath214 . for @xmath18 , at @xmath214",
    "the riemann scalar has an essential singularity , hence there is no such thing as globally regular solutions in these cases .",
    "hence , we shall only need to pay attention to ( exterior ) black hole solutions , meaning that our two singular points of interest are the event horizon @xmath20 and the asymptotic region @xmath21 .",
    "we assume that the black hole solutions have a regular , non - extremal event horizon at @xmath20 ; i.e. for which @xmath215 has a single zero .",
    "this fixes the value of @xmath216 as : @xmath217    we assume that the field variables @xmath218 , @xmath219 and @xmath197 have regular taylor expansions about @xmath220 , i.e. that for @xmath221 , @xmath222 letting @xmath223 in the field equation gives us the following boundary conditions for @xmath224 : @xmath225 so for fixed @xmath92 the expansions are determined entirely by the @xmath226 quantities given by @xmath220 , @xmath227 and @xmath228 . setting @xmath223 in the field equation , we can show that for a non - extremal event horizon we require @xmath229 which weakly constrains the possible values of @xmath13 near the horizon .",
    "it also follows from that for @xmath60 , we have a minimum event horizon radius given by the constraint @xmath230 since the field equations are invariant under @xmath231 , we may consider @xmath232 ( without loss of generality ) .      at infinity , we expect that the black hole will approach the topological analogue to ads space , i.e. that @xmath233 as @xmath21 .",
    "we assume that all the field variables have regular expansions in @xmath234 as @xmath100 approaches infinity : @xmath235 just as in the spherically symmetric case with @xmath5 , there are no _ a priori _ constraints on the values of @xmath236 , so that in general , the ads topological black holes will carry a global magnetic charge @xcite .",
    "a key part of our proof of the existence of non - trivial @xmath0 solutions is the analyticity in the initial conditions of the field variables , so that we may find solutions with initial conditions in a neighbourhood of those producing known solutions .",
    "thus , it is important that we can find some ` trivial ' known solutions .",
    "the field equations ( [ fesunkom ] , [ fesunkmpr ] , [ fesunkd ] ) are non - linear coupled equations , but they possess a number of analytic , trivial solutions .",
    "these arise by letting the functions @xmath197 be identical to a constant .",
    "this produces as a constraint @xmath237      equation clearly has the solution @xmath238 for all @xmath202 , which gives the rnads black hole with metric function @xmath239 where the magnetic charge @xmath240 is defined as @xmath241 this solution exists for all three values of @xmath10 .",
    "note that the magnetically charged rnads black hole is only a solution of the field equations if the charge is exactly this value .",
    "note also that for @xmath46 there is a difference . in that case ,",
    "@xmath242 , and hence in the @xmath0 case with planar symmetry , the solution is more similar to the schwarzchild - ads solution , discussed next .",
    "writing out in full and letting @xmath243 turns the @xmath244 into a system of linear equations , with the solution @xmath245 for @xmath19 , we have @xmath246 , so that @xmath247 for all @xmath202 , which agrees with previous work @xcite .",
    "this gives us @xmath248    for the case @xmath60 , it can be immediately seen that for to be correct , @xmath13 will have to be imaginary .",
    "thus in this case , all we have is rnads - type solutions ( due to @xmath249 ) and the only trivial embedded solutions are found by setting @xmath250 for all @xmath202 .",
    "for @xmath46 however , it is obvious that @xmath250 , which coincides with the @xmath242 case above , hence the only type of solution we have is the sads - type solution .",
    "we now demonstrate that it is possible to embed any solution of the @xmath6 field equations as an @xmath0 solution by a simple rescaling of variables .",
    "note that this is a fairly trivial step from the similar @xmath198 , @xmath19 case discussed in @xcite and the @xmath5 , @xmath19 case discussed in @xcite .",
    "any @xmath6 solution can be rescaled and embedded as an @xmath0 solution .    * proof",
    "* we begin with the field equations ( [ fesunkom ] , [ fesunkmpr ] , [ fesunkd ] ) .",
    "we attempt to rescale them with the following definitions : @xmath251 this rescaling leads to the following equations : @xmath252 with @xmath253 it can be checked that these are exactly the same equations as the @xmath254(2 ) field equations with general @xmath10 ( [ fesu2kom ] , [ fesu2kmprd]).@xmath255 + it is easy to see that the boundary conditions ( [ expanrh ] , [ expaninf ] ) reduce to the topological @xmath6 boundary equations given in @xcite .",
    "we have therefore proven that any @xmath6 topological black hole solution can be embedded into @xmath0 eym to yield an asymptotically topological anti - de - sitter black hole .",
    "one final fact of note is that these embedded solutions will have the same number of nodes as the original @xmath7 solution , since if @xmath256 for some @xmath257 , then so will @xmath258 , according to .",
    "this fact will be of importance in the proof of our second result ( theorem [ neighproof ] ) .",
    "our goal is to prove that we can find solutions throughout the whole range of the spacetime ; in other words , solutions which can be proven to exist at the event horizon , and can be integrated out arbitrarily far into the asymptotic regime .",
    "the way we do this is by proving that solutions exist locally at the event horizon and locally as @xmath21 ; then we prove that given any solution which remains regular in a specified range , we can continue to integrate that solution outwards , right into the asymptotic regime .",
    "we use these results to argue that locally regular solutions can be ` patched together ' to form global black hole solutions .",
    "we note existence has already been proven for @xmath198 case in @xmath0 eym @xcite and with @xmath259 and @xmath19 @xcite .      in this section , following e.g. @xcite , we shall make use of an established theorem of differential equations @xcite to demonstrate the local existence of solutions at the event horizon and near infinity . we begin by stating the theorem :    [ exdetheor]@xcite consider a system of differential equations for @xmath260 functions @xmath261 and @xmath262 of the form @xmath263 with constants @xmath264 and integers @xmath265 and",

    "then there exists an @xmath274-parameter family of solutions of the system such that @xmath275 where @xmath276 and @xmath277 are defined for @xmath273 , @xmath278 and are analytic in @xmath43 and @xmath279 .",
    "this theorem allows us to parameterize the family of solutions near a singular point of a set of ordinary differential equations .",
    "we need to take each singular point in turn ( here , @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) and change variables so that the field equations are in the form required by the theorem .",
    "after that , it is elementary to verify the forms we have chosen for our expansions of the field variables near the singular points ( [ expanrh ] , [ expaninf ] ) .",
    "now we turn our attention to the field equations at @xmath20 .",
    "we assume the existence of a non - degenerate event horizon , so that @xmath223 but @xmath280 is finite .",
    "we begin by proving a proposition analogous to that proven for @xmath0 , @xmath19 in @xcite .",

    "transforming back to our original variables gives us the correct behaviour and analyticity.@xmath255 + we have thus proven existence of solutions to the field equations for a black hole in some neighbourhood of the event horizon @xmath20 , satisfying the boundary conditions .",
    "local existence at infinity for asymptotically ads spherically symmetric black holes has been proven in @xcite , and the proof extends almost directly to the topological case .",
    "we note that , as in the ads spherically symmetric case , it is relatively easy to prove existence and we need only go to first order in the field variables , unlike in the asymptotically flat case where higher order terms were needed and the analysis was more involved @xcite . we also note that for ads space , the field equations are not actually singular as @xmath21 , but it is convenient to use this method anyway  the above theorem does not require the boundary points to be singular , but it can account for that if needed .",
    "again we prove a proposition analogous to one in @xcite .",
    "[ lexinf ] there exists an @xmath310-parameter family of local solutions of the field equations near @xmath311 , analytic in @xmath92 , @xmath236 , @xmath26 and @xmath234 such that @xmath312    * proof * we introduce new variables , following @xcite : @xmath313 then the field equations take the form : @xmath314 where @xmath315 ( where we have used the forms from ( [ wpsi ] , [ ppsi ] ) ) ; and since 1/@xmath98 is at least of order @xmath316 as @xmath317 , it can be observed that all of these polynomials are non - singular as @xmath317 .",
    "therefore we have proven local existence of solutions at infinity , and theorem [ exdetheor ] confirms that the functions exhibit the required behaviour near infinity .",
    "we also note that solutions are analytic in @xmath43 , @xmath92 , @xmath26 , @xmath236 and @xmath318 .",
    "also , by rescaling the time co - ordinate in the metric we can fix @xmath319 so that the spacetime is asymptotically ` topological ads ' as we have described it  this satisfies the boundary conditions , and the field variables are analytic in @xmath26 , @xmath236 , @xmath320 , @xmath100 and @xmath92.@xmath255      our strategy for proving the existence of genuinely @xmath0 solutions involves showing that given initial conditions near the singular point at the event horizon @xmath20 , we can regularly integrate the field equations out to infinity . to be specific , we wish to show that as long as @xmath23 ( required for the spacetime to be regular ) , then any solution that is regular up to a certain @xmath100 value can be extended for larger values of @xmath100 .",
    "to do this we use the field equations to prove the following lemma , which has been proven for the spherically symmetric cases of @xmath6 with @xmath198 @xcite , of @xmath0 with @xmath198 @xcite , and of @xmath0 with @xmath5 and @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "[ globreg ] as long as @xmath23 all field variables are regular functions of @xmath100 .    to prove this lemma",

    "in other words , as long as @xmath23 , if we start off with arbitrary initial conditions outside the event horizon ( i.e. a ` piece ' of a regular solution ) then we can continue to integrate it regularly outwards into the asymptotic region .",
    "this method is adapted from a similar one used in @xcite .    * proof * if @xmath326 , then by integrating the equation for @xmath327 in , we obtain @xmath328 since @xmath98 must have a minimum in @xmath329 , we define @xmath330 therefore : @xmath331 or @xmath332 the lhs is bounded above by the rhs , which we notice is constrained to be positive  this is because of the constraint , where we remember we require @xmath333 , and because the mass function is monotonic ( @xmath334 ) , which together means that @xmath335 .",
    "we can also see that since the lhs is a sum of squared ( i.e. positive ) terms in @xmath336 , each term must be bounded below by zero .",
    "hence @xmath27 is bounded and so is @xmath337 ( and thus @xmath338 ) , so direct integration gives us @xmath339 ( or @xmath99 ) bounded .",
    "using the cauchy - schwarz inequality and performing an integration gives us @xmath340 from here we see that each @xmath341 is finite .",
    "finally , we take the yang - mills equations , which can be rewritten in the form @xmath342 let @xmath343 . then we can write the above equation as @xmath344 from earlier , we can say that @xmath219 is finite for all @xmath345 .",
    "now we have @xmath346    we can now apply the cauchy - schwarz inequality again to obtain @xmath347 now , both @xmath219 and @xmath348 are finite on the interval @xmath349 $ ] , therefore the integrals on the rhs are finite , therefore the lhs is bounded . therefore , from we get @xmath350 finite , therefore @xmath351 is finite , and since @xmath326 , we finally have @xmath352 is finite .",
    "therefore we have proven that if @xmath23 , then given some initial conditions ( either on or outside the event horizon , so that @xmath23 ) to begin with , we can continue to regularly integrate out to obtain a solution.@xmath255 + we now have all the pieces we need to ` patch together ' solutions which exist and are regular throughout the range of the spacetime .",
    "the exact nature of this patching together will be discussed at the end .",
    "we now briefly turn our attention to the behaviour of the equations in the asymptotic limit .",
    "the main reason for the abundance of black hole solutions in the @xmath5 case ( as opposed to the @xmath198 case ) is the behaviour of the field equations in the asymptotic limit @xmath21 .",
    "this section closely follows our work in @xcite .    as @xmath21 , the yang - mills equations approximate to : @xmath353 we attempt to make the equations autonomous .",
    "first we introduce a new variable @xmath354 @xcite such that @xmath355 which reduces the equations down to @xmath356 this tells us that the system has a critical point when @xmath357 this constraint is identical to , so we already know the solutions ( given by . for @xmath19 ,",
    "the solutions are    @xmath358    for @xmath18 in general @xmath0 , the only critical point is at @xmath359 .",
    "however , as in previous works ( e.g. @xcite ) , it is not the nature of the critical points that is important , so much as the choice of variable we used to make the equations autonomous . in the @xmath198 case ,",
    "an appropriate choice of radial parameter was @xmath360 ( see e.g. @xcite ) , which goes to infinity as @xmath100 goes to infinity , so that the system had to reach the critical point ( as it had to go ` all the way along ' its trajectory in the phase space . ) in our case , however , we use @xmath361 as being more appropriate . as",
    "our radial parameter @xmath100 goes to infinity , the trajectory on the phase space gets shorter and shorter , so it does not have to reach the critical point of the system at infinity . to put it another way , a solution which corresponds to one within some interval @xmath362 ( for some large value of @xmath363 )",
    "will be transformed to one in the interval @xmath364 $ ] , and @xmath365 is arbitrarily small for large @xmath363 .",
    "this also explains why the values of the @xmath13s are allowed to be arbitrary at infinity , rather than being constrained to continue along a trajectory until reaching a limit defined by the position of the critical points .",
    "now have all of the pieces we need ( propositions [ lexeh ] and [ lexinf ] and lemma [ globreg ] ) to establish the existence of non - trivial @xmath0 solutions to the 4d topological eym field equations .",
    "the first theorem we shall prove ( theorem [ fixrhhighl ] ) is one of the two main results of our paper : it establishes the existence of nodeless topological @xmath0 solutions in the regime @xmath4 , for any fixed @xmath220 ( respecting possible minimum bounds on @xmath220 if @xmath60 ) and @xmath24 .",
    "note that theorem [ fixrhhighl ] is very much in line with the similar proof given in @xcite for @xmath19 .",
    "the next proposition proves the existence of nodeless topological @xmath0 solutions in some sufficiently small neighbourhood of an existing such solution ",
    "i.e. that these solutions exist in open sets  for any @xmath5 .",
    "finally , we use this proposition and the existence of trivial solutions to the field equations to prove the existence of non - trivial , nodeless topological @xmath1 solutions for @xmath5 .      for @xmath19",
    "it was demonstrated numerically in @xcite that for any value of @xmath2 , if @xmath11 was large enough , all of the solutions were such that the gauge field functions were nodeless ; and in @xcite it was shown for @xmath6 that if @xmath18 , the gauge field is monotonically increasing and therefore nodeless , for a positive @xmath366 . however , it may be observed , as in @xcite , that as @xmath2 increases ( for fixed @xmath92 ) , the region in which solutions may be found grows ever smaller .",
    "we now show that for any @xmath2 , for fixed initial parameters at the event horizon , and for @xmath4 , corresponding solutions to the field equations exist with gauge field functions non - zero everywhere .",
    "it can be noted that the situation here is very similar indeed to both the @xmath6 @xcite and @xmath0 @xcite spherically symmetric cases for @xmath5 , for which the analogue of the following proposition has already been proven ; so we will only sketch out the derivation here .",

    "* proof * first , a qualification : if @xmath367 , and for @xmath5 , we find that there is a minimum bound on @xmath220 given by @xmath218 being monotonic , i.e.    @xmath368    with the rhs manifestly positive .",

    "we continue along the lines of @xcite .",
    "we can use the change of variables @xmath379 then the equations are unchanged except for @xmath380 instead of @xmath381 , and for @xmath382 , we get : @xmath383 where @xmath384 we can note by looking at equations and that the only appearance of the constant @xmath10 is as a ` coefficient ' of terms in @xmath385 .",
    "therefore as @xmath374 we expect the influence of @xmath10 to be removed completely from the analysis , and the results are then the same as in the spherically symmetric case : the field equations are all regular as @xmath374 , and the solutions are analytic in @xmath220 , @xmath24 and @xmath370 .    near @xmath311 , exactly the same argument used to attain proposition [ lexinf ] shows we have solutions for @xmath370 small , and such solutions will be analytic in the field variables .",

    "first , we prove a powerful proposition : that if we assume the existence of an @xmath0 black hole solution , then we can definitely find other such solutions for any @xmath5 in some sufficiently small neighbourhood of it , which possess the same number of nodes .",

    "now take some @xmath396 such that for the existing solution , @xmath397 satisfies @xmath398 ; and let @xmath399 be a different set of initial gauge field values ( for another @xmath1 solution ) in some sufficiently small neighbourhood of the @xmath24s . by the analyticity argument above , these nearby @xmath0 solutions evolved from @xmath399 will be regular in the interval @xmath387 $ ] .",
    "that is , in this interval , it is again true that @xmath23 and all the gauge field functions are nodeless .    furthermore , it will still be the case at @xmath363 that @xmath398 for these nearby @xmath1 solutions as well as the existing @xmath1 solution . because of this , and because @xmath396 , we are able to consider the solutions in the asymptotic regime",
    ". provided @xmath363 is sufficiently large , the solution ( parameterised proportional to @xmath400 ) will not move very far along the phase space trajectory as @xmath100 increases from @xmath363 towards infinity .",
    "therefore @xmath401 will continue to be small and the asymptotic regime will continue to be valid.@xmath255 + lastly , we will use proposition [ sunneighb ] to prove the second of our main results  the existence of genuinely non - trivial @xmath0 solutions , for any fixed @xmath5 , in some neighbourhood of certain trivial solutions ( see section [ secembed ] ) .",
    "[ neighproof ] there exist non - trivial black hole solutions to the @xmath1 topological eym equations ( [ fesunkom ] , [ fesunkmpr ] , [ fesunkd ] ) , regular throughout the range @xmath22 .",
    "these solutions are analytic in the parameters @xmath220 , @xmath24 and @xmath402 , and are nodeless .",
    "* proof * from section [ secembed ] , it is clear that there exist rnads - type trivial solutions to the topological @xmath7 equations . from proposition [ sunneighb ] , we can therefore infer the existence of nearby @xmath7 solutions which are non - trivial ( i.e. whose gauge field functions are not identically zero ) .",
    "furthermore , from van der bij and radu @xcite we see that that with @xmath7 black holes for @xmath18 , @xmath8 ( which we can assume without loss of generality is positive at the event horizon ) is monotonically increasing , so it can never equal zero ; hence all these @xmath7 solutions will be nodeless .    therefore , we are also able to take one such nodeless @xmath7 solution and embed it as a topological @xmath1 solution ( remembering that this solution will similarly be nodeless , due to to ) . finally , using proposition [ sunneighb ] once again , we may infer the existence of genuinely non - trivial and nodeless @xmath1 solutions in some sufficiently small neighbourhood of this embedded nodeless @xmath1",
    "the aim of this paper was to prove the existence of genuine ( i.e. non - trivial and non - embedded ) solutions of the 4d @xmath0 eym topological field equations .",
    "we began by justifying the topological metric ansatz we used .",
    "then , we described the field equations and the gauge potential ansatz , taking a detour to prove its validity ( i.e. that it is invariant under an action of @xmath0 by principal bundle automorphisms ) , adapting a theorem of knzle s @xcite .",
    "we then considered the boundary conditions at the important singular points : the event horizon ( @xmath20 ) and asymptotically ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "we note that we considered only purely magnetic gauge fields , for which we had @xmath3 gauge field functions @xmath13 .",
    "we also derived some trivial solutions to these equations , and described how any @xmath6 solution can be embedded in @xmath0 to yield a solution by a scaling of variables .",
    "the field equations in question are singular at the event horizon and asymptotically , thus we began by proving local existence of solutions in the neighbourhood of these two singular regimes of the equations , using a method following @xcite .",
    "we also proved a lemma which states that any solution which regular in some small interval can continue to be integrated using the field equations to produce a solution which remains regular arbitrarily far from the event horizon , as long as @xmath403 remains positive .",
    "we then used these to prove one of our two main results : that for fixed values of the field variables at the event horizon ( @xmath220 , @xmath24 , @xmath404 ) , then as @xmath4 we can demonstrate the existence of solutions to the @xmath1 eym field equations .",
    "next , we proved a proposition stating that given the existence of any nodeless topological @xmath1 solution , we can always find solutions arbitrarily close that possess the same number of nodes .",
    "finally , we used the existence of known trivial solutions , and this proposition , to demonstrate the existence of non - trivial nodeless solutions to the field equations .    our main two results , therefore , prove the existence ( in the stated regimes ) of four - dimensional , topological solutions to @xmath0 eym field equations with a negative cosmological constant , with @xmath3 gauge degrees of freedom as in the spherically symmetric case ( @xmath19 ) , previously examined in @xcite .",
    "there are several very productive directions in which this research could next be taken .",
    "the most obvious and pressing issue is that of the linear stability ( under non - spherically symmetric perturbations , for  @xmath18 ) of the solutions we found : as we noted , it has previously been shown in @xcite that the number of unstable modes of a solution is related to the number of nodes the gauge fields possess , and we have proven the existence ( in certain regimes ) of nodeless black hole solutions .    given that we were successfully able to generalise previous work ( for black holes in @xmath0 and @xmath5 ) to include spaces whose topologies give the symmetries other than spherical , it is natural to ask what other sorts of solutions we could generalise in this way ; and as we said in the introduction , there is no shortage of work that we may possibly generalise .",
    "we mentioned the work of mann on topological higher - dimensional black holes @xcite  again , perhaps this work could be extended to @xmath0 .",
    "finally , as in @xcite , since there is no theoretical upper limit on @xmath2 , neither is there on the amount of ` hair ' we may give a topological black hole , though an interesting area of exploration might be @xmath405 : there is some evidence for existence of solutions to these @xcite but more work is required , and this work could extend into the inclusion of alternate topologies .",
    "results from this may or may not be significant , especially in view of the ads / cft ( conformal field theory ) correspondence ( see @xcite , among others ) and the fact that it has been conjectured that there are observables in the dual cft which are sensitive to the presence of black hole hair ( see @xcite for a discussion of non - abelian solutions in the context of the ads / cft correspondence . )",
