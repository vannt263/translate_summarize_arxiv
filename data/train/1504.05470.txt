    "one tantalizing and experimentally verifiable consequence of our full monte - carlo numerical simulations is a significant increase of the direct absorption of the @xmath5 pigments when in the core complex ( fig .",
    "the full numerical simulations take into account all the pigments which compose the core complex , subject to variations in energies and coupling strengths induced by the highly dynamical protein scaffold ( details in the supplementary information ) .",
    "however , the key result can be understood by a simple model with two effective excited states @xmath11 and @xmath12 coherently coupled with strength @xmath16 through the coulomb interaction between their transition dipoles , as described by a hamiltonian of the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the inter - band energy difference between the two bands . the eigenstates @xmath19 of the system hamiltonian in eq .",

    "hence , in the core complex , where coupling among rc and lh1 satisfies @xmath22 , excitonic coupling may lead to a measurable absorption intensity redistribution while leaving spectral positions almost unaffected due to the quadratic dependence on @xmath21 .    according to equation ( 2 ) ,",
    "absorption of the p870 band is enhanced when the ratio @xmath26 is positive . under these conditions ,",
    "the absorption of the b880 band decreases in equal measure such that the total absorption intensity remains constant .",
    "the geometrical details of the core complex imply that @xmath27 , a direct consequence of the almost tangential arrangement of lh1 bchl transition dipoles @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath28 provides an energy landscape that _ inhibits _ energy transfer funneling to the rc , enhancing p870 band absorption at the expense of _ slowing _ the lh1@xmath29 transfer step .",

    "we carried out two independent procedures for the oxidation reaction , @xmath30 , namely , optical excitation or stoichiometric addition in the dark of the oxidising agent potassium ferricyanide as explained in detail in the supplementary information .",
    "the oxidation reaction moves the @xmath31 resonance to @xmath32 nm , far into the infrared region , and therefore effectively suppresses the resonant coherent interaction between @xmath5 and lh1 pigments @xcite .",
    "subtracting core complex spectra of oxidised @xmath33 from those of neutral @xmath5 filters out the overwhelming b880 component and highlights the changes in the absorbing bands due to the coherent interaction @xmath16 . with both procedures we observed difference spectra from core complexes and purified rcs ( fig .",
    "2a ) which are in good agreement with theoretical calculations ( fig .",
    "2b ) , and consistent with an 80 @xmath0 increase in p870 absorption in the former over the latter ( fig .",
    "the enhanced absorption of the p870 band leads to the excitation of a state that is partially delocalised over @xmath5 and lh1 pigments , so it is not immediately clear that increased absorption at 870 nm implies the increased excitation of the @xmath5-pigments , which is desirable as it places excitations directly where charge separation takes place . even though the bchls have several optical transitions besides the @xmath10 transition , under physiological conditions , the @xmath10 transition(s ) is the most relevant in _",
    "r. rubrum_. indeed , recently published complete spectra from different water depths in oceans and lakes @xcite showed that in coastal waters and peat lakes blue light is absent , and that the spectra of these ecosystems are dominated by red and near - ir light .",
    "as such , under incoherent broadband illumination covering the entire near - ir spectral range , the prominent excitation concerns the @xmath10 transitions .",
    "thus , under physiological conditions , the excitation population of the special pair , @xmath34 , is determined by the absorbtion from the @xmath10 transitions , accounted for by a state@xmath35 .",
    "the requirement that many harvesting pigments should surround fewer charge separation pigments in order to increase the excitation of charge separation pigments , is illustrated by an analytical expression for @xmath36 in the absence of protein - induced inhomogeneities @xmath37 where @xmath38 represents the number of excitonically - coupled harvesting units encircling the @xmath39 pigments that initiate charge separation in the rc ( see supplementary information ) . in the particular case of the core complex",
    "these correspond to @xmath40 pigments for the lh1 and @xmath41 pigments for the special pair .",
    "full numerical simulations of the complete core complex result in a two - fold average increase of population @xmath34 due to extended delocalization over antenna pigments , and it provides the initial condition for dynamical simulations of eet ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "the probability of charge separation , @xmath42 , increases as extended delocalization focuses the excitation into the special pair , allowing the excitation to avoid the slow transfer step from lh1 to rc .",
    "this increase in charge separation provides a quantitative link between a coherent quantum effect and enhanced functionality .",
    "it is important to note that the physiological environment of light - harvesting complexes is highly disordered and dynamic , leading to variations in the excitonic energy splitting @xmath43 . upon averaging the complete expressions that lead to perturbative equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) over appropriate distributions ( see supplementary information ) , figure 4",
    "shows that excitation population is redistributed from antenna to @xmath5 pigments for all realistic levels of disorder .",
    "moreover , a maximum occurs for intermediate values of disorder , equal to half the excitonic energy splitting , @xmath44 .",
    "remarkably , the parameters which are consistent with pump - probe studies in rcs @xcite and reproduce our experimental dark - minus - light spectra ( see supplementary information ) optimize the population redistribution to the @xmath5 pigments .",
    "accordingly , neglecting disorder underestimates the 80% enhancement in the @xmath31 direct optical absorption , presented in figure 1 , due to this non - trivial enhancement arising from protein - induced inhomogeneities .",

    "even though the full expressions are used in this calculation , the perturbative expression , equation 3 of the main text , illustrates the physical principles .",
    "the sign of @xmath43 determines the direction of the redistribution : @xmath162 redistributes population from antenna to @xmath5 pigments , and vice versa for @xmath163 .",
    "hence , in situations where the inhomogeneous spectra of lh1 and @xmath5 overlap , there will be realizations where dipole strength is redistributed from antenna to @xmath5 pigments and vice versa , perhaps leading to a decrease in the effect on average . however , the population redistribution is largest whenever @xmath164 , so there is a non - trivial interplay between small inhomogeneity , which leads to a small but positive redistribution for each realization , and large inhomogeneity , which leads to a possibly large ( for realizations which are on resonance ) , but sometimes negative , redistribution .",
    "interestingly , this interplay leads to a maximum population redistribution , as shown in figure [ fig : ana_noise ] , when @xmath165 , where @xmath166cm@xmath4 is the energy difference between the p870 and b880 spectral peaks .",

    "in particular , it no longer possesses a transition associated with absorption at 870 nm . as a result , both the optical response and the coherent interactions between the p870 transition and other pigments are suppressed .",
    "additionally , the charge separation changes the charge distribution within the entire rc , which induces several effects in the optical spectra of the b and h @xcite . hence , `` light '' spectra  recorded from samples being subject to high illumination  will not show a contribution from the p870 band while `` dark '' spectra  obtained from samples subject to low illumination , such that @xmath170 occurs before the absorption of the next photon  will preserve the optical response of @xmath5 .",
    "experimentally recorded spectra and the theoretical calculation for these two situations is presented in fig .",
    "2a of the main text .",
    "the positions of peaks in optical absorption spectra correspond to the energies of optically active transitions , and peak broadening arises due to the interaction of excited state degrees - of - freedom with the environment .",
    "this interaction can induce decay to the electronic ground states or can result in variation of the electric field in the neighbourhood of pigments , resulting in dynamical changes of the excited state energies .",
    "both mechanisms broaden the absorption lineshape , but the latter dominates in condensed matter systems . depending on the timescale on which variations are produced , the broadening is termed homogeneous or inhomogeneous .",
    "homogeneous broadening acts within the lifetime of electronic excitation while the inhomogeneous component leads to differences among elements in the ensemble at a given time . in this section",
    "we perform full monte carlo calculations to simulate the experimental difference spectra .",
    "this procedure yields very good agreement with experimentally determined difference spectra ( fig . 2 of the main text ) .",
