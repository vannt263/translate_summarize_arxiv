    "it has been widely known that properties of hadrons undergo changes at finite temperature and/or density . in particular , the modification of vector mesons in medium plays an essential role in understanding the properties of the qcd vacuum under hot and/or dense environment ( see , for example , the following references and those therein  @xcite ) , since there may be a possible connection between their in - medium modification and the restoration of chiral symmetry of which spontaneous breakdown provides a mechanism for the mass generation of most hadrons . in particular , it is of great interest to see the in - medium change of the @xmath0 meson , since it is strongly coupled to the @xmath3 isovector channel and may be observed in dilepton productions ( @xmath4 ) in heavy - ion collision because of the fact that the dileptons produced from the @xmath0 meson can convey information on the mass shift of the @xmath0 meson without any contamination due to the strong interaction .",
    "in fact , there are already experimental results for changes of the @xmath0-meson properties in medium : the ceres / na45 collaboration has investigated low - mass electron pair productions in various collisions  @xcite .",
    "the na60 collaboration has recently announced that the averaged @xmath0-meson spectral function shows a strong broadening but no shift in mass  @xcite .",
    "the clas collaboration has reported that the medium effects on the @xmath0-meson mass are not observed  @xcite and some widening of the @xmath0-meson decay width is seen for the fe - ti target .",
    "however , the e325 experiment at the kek 12-gev proton synchrotron has measured the invariant mass spectra of @xmath5 pairs in @xmath6 reactions and has found that the @xmath0-meson mass is dropped by about @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the broadening of the @xmath0-meson width does not seem to fit the e325 data .",
    "the star collaboration has also reported a possible shift of the @xmath0-meson peak in the @xmath8 channel in au+au and @xmath9+@xmath9 collisions at @xmath10  @xcite . the tagx collaboration has observed an in - medium modification of the @xmath0-meson spectral function in @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 reactions  @xcite .",
    "the in - medium change of the @xmath0 meson has been extensively studied in many different theoretical approaches .",
    "brown and rho  @xcite first proposed a possible dropping of the @xmath0-meson mass , introducing the effective scalar glueball field in order to make the effective chiral lagrangian consistent with the qcd scaling property . ref .",
    "@xcite estimated the @xmath0-meson mass in medium dropped by about @xmath14 .",
    "subsequently , hatsuda and lee have shown its mass shifted by about @xmath15  @xcite , based on the qcd sum rules .",
    "carter et al .",
    "@xcite , on the contrary , have found that it turns out much smaller , i.e. around @xmath16 , since the glueball field is rather stable in medium in their effective lagrangian approach .",
    "klingl et al .",
    "@xcite , however , have investigated the in - medium @xmath0-meson properties in the qcd sum rules but have concluded that the change of the @xmath0 meson in medium can not be interpreted simply by the mass dropping of the @xmath0 meson alone . refs .",
    "@xcite have shown in the study of the @xmath0-meson spectral function that the width broadening is more important to interpret the corresponding experimental data .",
    "thus , no consensus has been reached , either experimentally or theoretically , as yet on how the @xmath0 meson experiences the change in medium .    in the present work ,",
    "we want to investigate the electromagnetic charge radii of the pion at finte density but @xmath17 within the framework of the nonlocal chiral quark model ( n@xmath18qm ) from the instanton vacuum , based on which the mass shift of the @xmath0 meson will be evaluated , associating with the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) in a phenomenological approach .",
    "we already studied the electromagnetic ( em ) form factor of the pion within the same framework  @xcite . since the instanton vacuum at finite density was investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite some years ago , we can immediately use the formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite to extend our previous work into finite density .",
    "thus , we first consider in this work the pion em form factor at finite quark chemical potentials ( @xmath19 ) and its charge radii .",
    "having shown how much the pion charge radius is modified in medium , we try to translate its change at finite density into the corresponding shift of the @xmath0-meson mass in medium with the help of the vmd .",
    "the present work is organized as follows : in section ii , we make a brief introduction of the n@xmath18qm and its application to the nonzero @xmath19 .",
    "the parameterized pion em form factor in terms of the vmd is introduced in order to determine the mass dropping of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "the numerical results with discussions are given in section iii .",
    "the final section is devoted to the summary and conclusion .",
    "we start with the definition of the pion em form factor in the space - like region : @xmath20 where @xmath21 stands for the positively charged pion state ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the @xmath23 and @xmath24 represent the initial and final on - shell momenta for the pion , satisfying @xmath25 .",
    "the pion mass @xmath26 is taken to be 140 mev for numerical input .",
    "the momentum transfer is defined as @xmath27 and @xmath28 in the space - like region . here , the local em current in flavor su(2 ) is defined in euclidean space as follows : @xmath29 with the charge operator @xmath30 .",
    "note that all calculations are performed in euclidean space , since we are interested in the form factor in the space - like region .",
    "the em form factor satisfies the normalization condition at @xmath31 by charge conservation : @xmath32 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have already computed the pion em form factor in free space , employing the nonlocal chiral quark model ( n@xmath18qm ) from the instanton vacuum  @xcite .",
    "a great virtue of the n@xmath18qm from the instanton vacuum lies in the fact that there are only two parameters , namely , the average instanton size @xmath33 and average inter - instanton distance @xmath34 .",
    "the normalization scale of this approach can be defined by the average size of instantons and is approximately equal to @xmath35 mev .",
    "the values of the @xmath36 and @xmath37 were estimated phenomenologically in ref .",
    "@xcite as well as theoretically in ref .",
    "furthermore , it was confirmed by various lattice simulations of the qcd vacuum @xcite .",
    "moreover , lattice calculations of the quark propagator  @xcite are in a remarkable agreement with that of ref .  @xcite . a recent lattice simulation with the interacting instanton liquid model obtains @xmath38 and @xmath39 with the finite current quark mass @xmath40 taken into account  @xcite .",
    "the n@xmath18qm turns out to be very successful in describing properties of hadrons in the low - energy regime .",
    "however , the presence of the nonlocal interaction between quarks and pseudo - goldstone bosons breaks the gauge invariance for the external vector fields .",
    "since the pion em form factor involves the vector current , we need to deal with this problem . while ref .",
    "@xcite proposed a systematic way as to how the conservation of the nther current is restored , one has to handle the integral equation .",
    "@xcite derived the light - quark partition function in the presence of the external gauge fields . with this gauged partition function",
    ", it was shown that the low - energy theorem for the transition from two - photon state to the vacuum via the axial anomaly was satisfied  @xcite . moreover",
    ", the gauged effective chiral action has been shown to describe well a great deal of mesonic properties such as the meson distribution amplitudes and kaon semileptonic decay form factors  @xcite .",
    "as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , if the external vector fields are weak enough , the gauged effective chiral action in the chiral limit can be written in terms of the covariant derivative @xmath41 : @xmath42 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the functional trace @xmath43 runs over space - time , color , flavor and dirac spaces .",
    "the @xmath44 is the covariant derivative expressed as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 stands for the external em gauge field .",
    "the @xmath47 denotes the nonlinear goldstone boson fields defined as : @xmath48 where @xmath49 stands for the pion decay constant : @xmath50 mev .",

    "( [ eq : eca ] ) .",
    "now , we are in a position to introduce the quark chemical potential ( @xmath19 ) in the model in order to calculate the pion em form factor in medium . since we consider the case of the chiral limit , isospin symmetry is automatically taken into account : @xmath51 .",
    "thus , we need to consider only the isoscalar quark chemical potential . in the present work ,",
    "we closely follow ref .",

    "@xcite qualitatively well .",
    "the cut - off mass @xmath62 , which is taken to be the inverse of the avergage instanton size , can be consistently determined by the self - consistency equation : @xmath63 although there must be corrections due to the presence of the quark chemical potential , they are very small as far as we stay below the region below normal nuclear matter density ( @xmath64 mev ) .",
