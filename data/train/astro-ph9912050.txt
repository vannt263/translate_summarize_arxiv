    "<S> in a line caustic crossing microlensing event , the caustic line moving across the surface of the source star provides a direct method to measure the integrated luminosity profile of the star . </S>",
    "<S> combined with the enormous brightening at the caustic crossings , microlensing offers a promising tool for studying stellar luminosity profiles . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the amplification behavior of the two extra images that become partial images conjoined across the critical curve at a line caustic crossing . </S>",
    "<S> we identify the multiplicative factors that depend on the caustic crossing point and the relative size of the star , and the shape function that depends on the stellar luminosity profile . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the analytic limb - darkening models  linear , square root , and square  using the analytic form of the shape function . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the microlensing lightcurves must be determined to an accuracy of better than @xmath0-@xmath1 in order to be able to determine the linear limb - darkening parameter @xmath2 with precision of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this is similar to the accuracy level required in eclipsing binaries as reported by popper ( 1984 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> ( )    the caustic curve of a binary lens is where the number of images changes by two , and the two images that appear or disappear are extremely bright . </S>",
    "<S> the caustic curve is a geometric curve with zero width , and the differential limb darkening profile of a lensed star ( of a typical size of @xmath4as ) can be readily scanned during a caustic crossing . </S>",
    "<S> the achromaticity of gravitational lensing and the large magnification of the two extra images help microlensing to be a rather clean tool for studying the luminosity profiles of the lensed stars .    </S>",
    "<S> the microlensing method has several advantages :  1 )   the universality of gravitation guarantees that any star can be lensed , and its limb darkening can be studied through microlensing . </S>",
    "<S> that is not always the case in other methods . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the lensed star of the recent line - caustic crossing binary microlensing event macho-98-smc-1 (; and references therein ) was a ( spectroscopically ) normal low metalicity a star @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> normal a stars have not been found in short - period binary systems @xcite , and their limb darkening is unlikely to be studied through eclipsing .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 )   the auxiliary object that accommodates high resolution scanning of the lensed star is a foreground ( lensing ) object that has no physical interaction with the lensed star under study . combined with enormous brightening , </S>",
    "<S> the physical independence simplifies the interpretation of the event . in an eclipsing binary </S>",
    "<S> , the very close interaction of the eclipsed star with the companion ( the auxiliary object ) requires an elaborate modeling of the binary system with many parameters @xcite and makes it more difficult for the method to be robust .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 )   microlensed stars are in the galactic bulge ( @xmath5  kpc ) or in the magellanic clouds ( @xmath6 , @xmath7  kpc ) , and microlensing allows studies of the luminosity profiles of faint distant stars .    resolving stars without auxiliary means has not been feasible technologically except for the biggest stars in the sky : the sun and more recently betelgeuse ( m2 supergiant ) studied with hst @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most of the studies of stellar luminosity profiles have been done with a handful of detached eclipsing binaries . in eclipsing binaries </S>",
    "<S> , the companion traverses in front of the star and effectively scans the luminosity profile of the eclipsed star by absorbing the light . </S>",
    "<S> how well one can determine the profiles depends on the well depth of the eclipse light curve , and it has been estimated through numerical simulations that 100 or more observations within minima with a relatively small photometric error of @xmath8 are necessary to be able to determine the linear limb darkening parameter of the eclipsed star with the uncertainty of @xmath3 or less @xcite . these simulations were done with simplified models , and obtaining the precision of @xmath3 may turn out to be more demanding in practice .    in a caustic crossing gravitational microlensing , the caustic curve traverses across the surface of the star and scans the integrated luminosity profiles of the star by partially magnifying the star . </S>",
    "<S> this partial magnification is due to the two extra images , and the magnification behavior of them can be expressed as a simple analytic function integrated over the luminosity profile . </S>",
    "<S> we examine analytic models of the luminosity profiles and find that relatively small photometric errors are required for the determination of the limb - darkening profiles :  in order to be able to determine the linear limb darkening parameter @xmath2 with an uncertainty of @xmath3 or less , photometric accuracy of @xmath9 is required depending on the value of @xmath2 ( see figure [ fig - delc ] and [ fig - delc - norm ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been a common practice to incorporate the effect of the luminosity profile of the lensed star for the high resolution behavior of the light curve ( for example , supernovae lensing by schneider and wagoner ( 1987 ) ) . for stable stars , </S>",
    "<S> the linear limb - darkening law @xcite has been the default model for stellar luminosity profiles . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the cosine of the angle between the line of sight and the normal vector of the surface element of the photosphere . </S>",
    "<S> the sun is known to follow the linear law in the optical bands @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we had adopted @xmath12 as a generic value for main sequence stars in the calculation of the detection probability of microlensing earth mass planets @xcite . however , the linear models are suspected to be inadequate especially for hot stars , and non - linear terms have been added in the functional form of the analytic models . </S>",
    "<S> recently , daz - cordovs , claret and gimnez studied lte ( local thermodynamic equilibrium ) model atmospheres ( with standard solar compositions ) calculated by kurucz ( 1991 ) in search for suitable analytic limb - darkening models @xcite that fit the numerical results . </S>",
    "<S> the limb - darkening models in their work can be written in the following form . @xmath13 </S>",
    "<S> a homogeneous model is given by @xmath14 , a linear model is given by @xmath15 , and a non - linear model refers to a combination of the linear terms and one of the non - linear terms ( @xmath16 : square model ; @xmath17 : square - root model ) . </S>",
    "<S> the larger the index @xmath18 , the more darkened in the limb is the radial luminosity profile given by @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 is the center luminosity ( at @xmath21 ) , and the condition @xmath22 ensures that the linear combination on the rhs of the equation ( [ eqprofile ] ) has value @xmath23 at @xmath21 .    in a binary lens , </S>",
    "<S> a source star outside the caustic curve produces three normal images and a source star inside the caustic curve produces extra two bright images in addition to the three normal images . at a caustic crossing , the surface of the star </S>",
    "<S> is divided into two regions by the caustic line moving at a constant velocity , and only the part of the star that falls inside the caustic produces two extra images . </S>",
    "<S> these partial images are connected at the _ critical curve _ </S>",
    "<S> ( of the lens equation ) , and this criticality is what underwrites microlensing as a potential tool for measuring stellar luminosity profiles .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 )   the magnification of these two images is governed by the generic critical behavior of lensing , and this generic behavior simplifies the interpretation of the lensing . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the light curve of the two partial images bears direct measurements of the integrated luminosity profile of the source star ( measured in time through the moving caustic line ) .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 )   the critical curve is the loci of the images of divergent magnification of point sources . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the two partial images joined across the critical curve are highly magnified and dominate the behavior of the total light curve . </S>",
    "<S> the three normal images are full images , insensitive to the luminosity profile of the source star , and their brightness varies relatively slowly in time ( unless the crossing is very near a cusp ) .    the nomenclature _ </S>",
    "<S> critical curve </S>",
    "<S> _ derives from the fact that the lens equation is _ critical _ , or , _ stationary _ on the curve . </S>",
    "<S> one of the eigenvalues of the jacobian matrix of the lens equation vanishes on the critical curve , and the lens equation is quadratic in the eigendirection of the vanishing eigenvalue . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the amplification of the images in the neighborhood of the critical curve is proportional to the inverse square root of the distance of the source to the caustic . </S>",
    "<S> the proportionality constant that determines the overall peak amplification of the light curve of the two extra images is given by the inverse square root of the derivative of the jacobian determinant in the _ critical direction _ ( the eigendirection of the vanishing eigenvalue ) . </S>",
    "<S> general discussions of this critical behavior of lensing can be found in the literature ( _ e.g. _ , ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , we include a brief derivation of the critical behavior of the class of binary lenses not only because the class is directly relevant to experiments , but also because its simplicity allows easy access to concrete understanding of the critical behavior .    </S>",
    "<S> if the complex variables @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote an image position and its source position respectively , the binary lens equation is given as follows @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the fractional masses of the lenses located at @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the lens equation is intrinsically a relation between angular position variables , and the lens plane ( the complex plane parameterized by @xmath24 or @xmath25 ) can be put anywhere along the line of sight . </S>",
    "<S> the lens plane is a linear plane normal to the line of sight and is equivalent to the angular space because scattering ( deflection ) angles involved in microlensing are small ( @xmath31 ) . </S>",
    "<S> if the lens plane is considered to pass through the center of the mass of the lenses , the einstein ring radius of the total mass @xmath32 of the binary lenses is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the reduced distance :  @xmath35 , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the distances along the line of sight ( or in the radial direction ) of the observer and the source star from the lensing system respectively . </S>",
    "<S> ( it is conventional that  @xmath38 \" is reserved for the einstein ring radius given by @xmath39 . ) the position variables can be rescaled by @xmath38 so that the unit distance scale of the lens plane is set by the einstein ring radius :  @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> ( in the following , all the position variables are measured in units of @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> however , we may replace @xmath23 by @xmath38 when we find it useful for clarity . ) </S>",
    "<S> the so - called image plane is the lens plane parameterized by the image position variable ( here @xmath24 ) and the source plane is the lens plane parameterized by the source position variable ( here @xmath25 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the linear ( differential ) behavior of the lens equation is given by @xmath41 where   @xmath42 , and @xmath43 the eigenvalues of the jacobian matrix @xmath44 are @xmath45 and the corresponding eigenvectors are @xmath46 where @xmath47 , the eigenvalue @xmath48 vanishes , and the jacobian matrix @xmath44 behaves as a projection operator . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the curve defined by @xmath47 is called the critical curve . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , the jacobian determinant @xmath49 vanishes on the critical curve . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath50 is a displacement from a point @xmath24 on the critical curve , @xmath51 is a non - vanishing displacement vector parallel to the upper component of the eigenvector @xmath52 with eigenvalue @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath54 and @xmath55 denote the upper components of the eigenvectors ( the lower components are their complex conjugates ) , _ i.e. _ , @xmath56 and @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> then , @xmath58 where the linear coefficients @xmath59 are real , and , @xmath60 because of this projection effect , the corresponding area element ( in the @xmath25-plane ) vanishes , @xmath61 , and the magnification of its image diverges : @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> now , the caustic curve is , by definition , a curve on the @xmath25-plane which the critical curve is mapped onto under the lens equation . thus , if @xmath50 is an arbitrary displacement tangent to the critical curve , the induced displacement @xmath51 in the @xmath25-plane is tangent to the caustic curve . </S>",
    "<S> since the induced displacement @xmath51 is always in the direction of @xmath54 as we have seen in equation ( [ eqdomega ] ) , @xmath54 is tangent to the caustic curve everywhere ; or , the critical direction @xmath55 is normal to the caustic curve . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , when the source star approaches the caustic curve , the distance to the caustic @xmath63 can not be expressed as a linear function of the image displacement from the critical curve @xmath50 . if @xmath64 is the second order contribution , @xmath65 if @xmath66 , @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the derivatives of the jacobian determinant @xmath70 in the eigendirections . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath71 since @xmath72 on the critical curve , the jacobian determinant near the critical curve is simply @xmath73 in the linear approximation . </S>",
    "<S> now , we need to solve the lens equation to find @xmath74 and @xmath75 for a given displacement @xmath76 . if we consider only the leading order terms , @xmath77 then , @xmath78 , and @xmath75 is the solution of the following quadratic equation . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath79 solutions exist where the discriminant is non - negative . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath80 the equality holds on the critical curve ( @xmath81 ) as one can verify from equations ( [ eqdj ] ) and ( [ eqquad ] ) . the jacobian determinant can be calculated for the two solutions using ( [ eqdj ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath82 now , let s note from the equality in ( [ eqdm ] ) that the caustic curve is quadratic :  @xmath83  ( if @xmath84 ) . therefore , the eigenvectors , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , rotate (  frame rotation \" ) as they move along the caustic curve . in this lowest approximation </S>",
    "<S> , however , we can ignore the rotation , and the displacement of the point @xmath85 from the caustic curve can be approximated by @xmath86 the distance is @xmath87 , and the jacobian determinant takes a simple form . @xmath88 </S>",
    "<S> the two images have opposite parities , and their magnifications @xmath89 have a simple relation to the distance of the source to the caustic @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath90 the condition for the existence of the two extra images ( [ eqdm ] ) can be rewritten elegantly as follows . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath91 since the eigenvector @xmath55 is normal to the caustic curve , if a source position with @xmath92 is in one side of the caustic , then a source position with @xmath93 is in the other side of the caustic . </S>",
    "<S> so , the inequality ( [ eqinside ] ) tells us that a source in one side of the caustic curve ( determined by the direction vector @xmath94 ) generates two extra images , but a source in the other side of the caustic does not . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a source star produces two partial images at a caustic crossing . in lensing where the wave property of the photon beam can be ignored </S>",
    "<S> , the caustic curve is a geometric curve with zero width , and the source star is resolved by the caustic as a form of two partial images that change in time . </S>",
    "<S> ( the side of the caustic where the two extra images are produced is the inside of the caustic . )    the inverse square - root dependence of the amplification @xmath95 on the distance @xmath63 of a source position from the caustic curve in equation ( [ eqcausamp ] ) does nt hold if the second order contribution vanishes , @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> the source displacement from the caustic @xmath64 induced from the image displacement @xmath50 ( from the critical curve ) in equation ( [ eqdm ] ) vanishes , when @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath98 so , there are two cases where @xmath99 vanishes :  @xmath100 or @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> the condition @xmath102 defines limit points where @xmath103 not the critical curve where @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath64 vanishes only if @xmath104 which is the condition for bifurcation of @xmath105 constant curves @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are two cases where the critical curve has bifurcation points . if we let @xmath106 be the separation between the lens elements , the critical curves with bifurcation points satisfy special relations between the lens parameters @xmath107 and @xmath28 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the critical curve has one bifurcation point on the lens axis if @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath109 the critical curve has two bifurcation points off the lens axis if @xmath110 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath111 since the lens equation is continuous ( actually differentiable ) in the neighborhood of the critical curve ( the lens equation is singular only at the lens positions where @xmath112 ) , the caustic curve bifurcates where the critical curve bifurcates . at the bifurcation points ( four - prong vertex ) of the critical curve , </S>",
    "<S> the lens equation is stationary along the critical curve . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the caustic curve forms a ( doubly degenerate ) cusp where it bifurcates . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath113 , the critical curve is tangent to @xmath55 , and the lens equation is stationary with respect to a displacement along the critical curve . therefore , the caustic curve forms a cusp where @xmath113 . on the bifurcation points , </S>",
    "<S> both components @xmath69 and @xmath68 vanish because the jacobian determinant @xmath70 is stationary in every direction : @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if we consider only the line caustic crossings away from cusps , the quadratic behavior of the lens equation in the direction of @xmath55 remains valid , and the amplification of the two extra images across the critical curve can be discussed using the expression in equation ( [ eqcausamp ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the caustic curve has 8 cusps if  @xmath115 , 6 cusps if  @xmath116 , and 10 cusps if  @xmath117 .    </S>",
    "<S> the amplification coefficient @xmath118 increases toward a cusp ( @xmath113 ) where it diverges . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ figcrit ] shows the `` central caustic '' of a binary lens with the fractional minor mass @xmath119 and the separation @xmath120 . </S>",
    "<S> the `` central caustic '' ( always across the lens axis , and here contains the center of mass inside ) has four cusps , and @xmath121 has four zeros at @xmath122 , and @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the phase angle of  @xmath125 ( in the riemann sheet ) . </S>",
    "<S> the four blue crosses on the caustic curve mark the loci of the local maxima of @xmath121 . </S>",
    "<S> since the amplification of the  two extra images \" is proportional to it , @xmath118 can be considered as the  strength \" of the caustic curve . </S>",
    "<S> ( as we will discuss later , the actual amplification of the two images also depends on the relative size of the source star with respect to the einstein ring radius , which may be considered as a scale factor . ) </S>",
    "<S> note that the local minima of @xmath118 are very close to the off - axis cusps . </S>",
    "<S> we may loosely refer to it as that the cusps on the lens axis are stronger than the ones off the lens axis . in the same token </S>",
    "<S> , we can say that the cusp at @xmath126 ( near the dominant mass @xmath127 ) is stronger than the cusp at @xmath128 . in the case of macho-98-smc-1 , </S>",
    "<S> the second caustic crossing was closer to a cusp on the lens axis ( @xmath129 ) than the first caustic to its nearest cusp ( @xmath130 ) , and the caustic crossing amplification peak for the second caustic crossing is bigger than the first ( see figure 1 and 2 in rhie et  al 1999 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this lens ( @xmath131 and @xmath132 ) also has two triangular caustic curves off the lens axis ( and reflection symmetric with respect to the lens axis  real line here ) , and each has  topological charge \" @xmath133 . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvectors @xmath134 rotate by @xmath135 around each triangular caustic curve ( or  trioid \" ) . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvectors rotate by @xmath136 around the central caustic  quadroid \" in figure [ figcrit ] which has  topological charge \" @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> these off - axis caustics are  weaker \" than the caustics which cross the lens axis . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the maximum of @xmath121 on these  trioids \" ( closed curve that is smooth except at three cusps ) @xmath137 which is about 7 times larger than the maximum on the  central caustic \" (  quadroid \" : closed curve that is smooth except at four cusps ) .    if @xmath113 , equations ( [ eqquadone ] ) or ( [ eqquad ] ) becomes linear in @xmath75 , and one obtains a linear solution whose amplification depends linearly on the inverse of the distance of the source to the caustic :   @xmath138 . </S>",
    "<S> when the source exits the caustic through a cusp , this image crosses the critical curve . </S>",
    "<S> this is the third image that diverges at a cusp crossing . </S>",
    "<S> the other two image solutions can be obtained by including the third order terms in the expansion of @xmath139 in ( [ eqquadone ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> if the source is sufficiently small compared to the caustic curve , the probability of crossing the caustic through a cusp is small . </S>",
    "<S> out of about ten caustic crossing binary lensing events discovered so far @xcite , macho-97-blg-28 was the only event where the crossing was through a cusp @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the source star of the event macho-97-blg-28 was a giant star . </S>",
    "<S> most of the lensed stars in microlensing experiments are main sequence stars . here </S>",
    "<S> , we consider caustic crossings away from cusps only .    </S>",
    "<S> if the source is sufficiently small , the curvature of the caustic curve can also be ignored , and we can assume that the luminosity variation of the light curve over the caustic crossing is largely determined by the critical behavior of the lensing amplification and the luminosity profile of the source star . if we let the line caustic be along the @xmath140-direction , the lensing amplification is independent of @xmath140 , and we only need to know the  1-d luminosity profile \" of the source in the normal direction , say @xmath141-direction , which is obtained by integrating the 2-d profile along the @xmath140-direction . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth emphasizing that the luminosity profile we probe directly in a line - caustic crossing microlensing event is the 1-d luminosity profile of the source star . </S>",
    "<S> ( the  irregularities \" of the stars such as star spots are not addressed here . </S>",
    "<S> the 1-d luminosity profile will depend on the position of the spots with respect to the direction of the caustic line . )    if the size of the star is @xmath142 ( in units of einstein ring radius ) , the luminosity profile in equation ( [ eqprofile ] ) can be rewritten in terms of the radial coordinate @xmath143 of the stellar disk using @xmath144 . </S>",
    "<S> we let @xmath145 such that  @xmath141 and @xmath140 are the cartesian coordinates of the unit stellar disk , and define a dimensionless 1-d luminosity function  @xmath146 based on the radial luminosity profile in equation ( [ eqprofile ] ) . </S>",

    "<S> the peak values are given by @xmath161 :  @xmath162 , and  @xmath163 . </S>",
    "<S> because of the integration in @xmath140 , the limb - darkening effect is more accentuated in the 1-d luminosity profile compared to the radial luminosity profile of the stellar disk .    </S>",
    "<S> the amplification profile of the two extra images at a caustic crossing can be calculated using the luminosity profile @xmath164 and the analytic form of the point source amplification function @xmath95 in equation ( [ eqcausamp ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath165 since the point source amplification function @xmath166 vanishes in one side of the caustic line , we may specify the segment of the one dimensional star ( as defined by the 1-d luminosity function ) that is inside the caustic , say , as given by an interval @xmath167 $ ]   where @xmath168 . </S>",
