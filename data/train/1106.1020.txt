    ".      any deterministic numerical method requires to work on a _ bounded _ velocity space . here",
    ", the idea only consists in adding some non physical binary collisions by _ periodizing _ the function and the collision operator .",

    "thus the scheme is not conservative anymore , although it still preserves the mass if the periodization is done carefully .",

    "this periodization is the basis of spectral methods and we shall discuss below this non physical truncation ( associated with limit conditions ) of this velocity space .",

    "when @xmath55 has support included in @xmath142 , @xmath143 , it is usual ( see @xcite ) to search for the minimal period @xmath144 ( in order to minimize the computational cost ) which prevents interactions between different periods of @xmath55 during _ one _ collision process . from now on , we shall always assume that we can take @xmath144 and @xmath88 large enough such that , when needed , @xmath145 .",

    "<S> in this paper we present a fully deterministic method for the numerical solution to the boltzmann equation of rarefied gas dynamics in a bounded domain for multi - scale problems . </S>",
    "<S> periodic , specular reflection and diffusive boundary conditions are discussed and investigated numerically . </S>",
    "<S> the collision operator is treated by a fourier approximation of the collision integral , which guarantees spectral accuracy in velocity with a computational cost of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the number of degree of freedom in velocity space . </S>",
    "<S> this algorithm is coupled with a second order finite volume scheme in space and a time discretization allowing to deal for rarefied regimes as well as their hydrodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> finally , several numerical tests illustrate the efficiency and accuracy of the method for unsteady flows ( poiseuille flows , ghost effects , trend to equilibrium ) </S>",
