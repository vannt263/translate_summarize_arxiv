    "in the past decade , atmospheric  @xcite , solar  @xcite , reactor  @xcite and long - baseline accelerator  @xcite neutrino experiments have provided compelling evidence for the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations .",
    "this has reshaped our understanding of the properties of elementary particles as it implies that neutrinos have mass and mix .",
    "the combined data can be described by two mass squared differences , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , whose current best fit values are @xmath6 and @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the two mixing angles @xmath8 and @xmath9 drive the solar and kamland , and atmospheric and minos neutrino oscillations , respectively , and are measured to be @xmath10 and @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "the third mixing angle , @xmath0 , is yet undetermined but is known to be small or zero . with available data , @xmath0 is constrained to be  @xcite @xmath12 it is interesting to note that very recently a first hint in favour of @xmath13 has been found  @xcite in a combined analysis of atmospheric , solar and long - baseline reactor neutrino data , with : @xmath14 implying a preference for @xmath15 at 90%cl .",
    "a different analysis  @xcite confirms the hint for @xmath16 at 1.5  @xmath17 from the analysis of solar and kamland data owing to the latest sno results , but not the one from the atmospheric data .",
    "although the experimental progress in neutrino physics over the last decade has been conspicuous , many of the fundamental questions surrounding neutrinos still need to be addressed .",
    "understanding of the physics beyond the standard model responsible for neutrino masses and mixing requires knowledge of the nature of neutrinos ( whether dirac or majorana particles ) , the neutrino mass ordering ( normal or inverted ) , the absolute neutrino mass scale , the value of the unknown mixing angle @xmath0 , and whether cp - symmetry is violated in the lepton sector .",
    "it will also be necessary to improve the precision on the known parameters , in particular to measure any deviation from maximal @xmath9 and , if so , to determine its octant .",
    "some of the issues above will be addressed by a future program of neutrino oscillation experiments  @xcite .",
    "in particular , long baseline experiments using conventional beams  @xcite and nuclear reactors  @xcite will be the first to explore @xmath0 below the current limit and maybe confirm the hint for @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath0 is close to the present bound imposed by the running and near future experiments , the next generation of superbeams  @xcite , an extension of a conventional beam with an upgrade in intensity and detector size , and wide - band beams  @xcite will probe cp - violation and , for sufficiently long baseline , the neutrino mass hierarchy . for small values of @xmath0 or , if @xmath0 is large but a better precision on the neutrino parameters needs to be achieved , the community must turn to the novel concepts of the neutrino factory  @xcite or beta - beam  @xcite .",
    "whereas conventional beams sourced from pion decays have an intrinsic contamination of electron neutrino at the @xmath19 1% level ( owing to kaons in the beam ) , neutrino factories and beta - beams will have clean sources from highly accelerated muons and ions , respectively , producing a well - collimated beam . in a neutrino factory , muons ( antimuons )",
    "are produced , cooled and accelerated to a high boost before being stored in a decay ring .",
    "the subsequent decay sources a muon neutrino ( muon antineutrino ) and electron antineutrino ( electron neutrino ) which are aimed at magnetised detectors located a very long distance from the source .",
    "the use of magnetised detectors is necessary to separate the ` right muon ' disappearance signal from the ` wrong muon ' appearance signal , which is sensitive to matter effects and cp - violation .",
    "a beta - beam will exploit accelerated ions that @xmath1-decay sourcing a clean , collimated , electron neutrino beam .",
    "magnetised detectors will not be necessary in this case , the only requirement being possession of good muon identification to detect the appearance channels .",
    "therefore , water erenkov ( wc ) , totally active scintillator , liquid argon detectors and non - magnetised iron calorimeters could be used , depending on the peak energy .",
    "the determination of the oscillation parameters is severely affected by degeneracies  @xcite ; the possibility that different sets of the unknown parameters @xmath20 octant ) can provide an equally good fit to the probability for neutrino and antineutrino oscillations , for fixed baselines and energy .",
    "therefore , a high precision measurement of the appearance probabilities is not sufficient to discriminate the various allowed solutions .",
    "in order to weaken or resolve this issue , various strategies have been put forward : exploiting the energy dependence of the signal in the same experiment  @xcite , using reactor neutrino experiments with an intermediate baseline  @xcite , combining different long baseline experiments  @xcite , adding the information on @xmath0 from reactor experiments  @xcite , or using more than one baseline for the same beam  @xcite . in addition",
    ", @xmath0 controls the earth matter effects in multi - gev atmospheric  @xcite and in supernova neutrino oscillations  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    ". these might provide useful information on the type of neutrino mass hierarchy and @xmath0 ; the magnitude of the t - violating and cp - violating terms in neutrino oscillation probabilities is directly proportional to @xmath21  @xcite .    in beta - beam experiments , the energy dependence of the signal",
    "is typically used to extract information on the mass hierarchy and cp - violation .",
    "matter effects increase with baseline and energy suggesting that setups with baselines @xmath22 600 km are necessary  @xcite for the determination of the type of neutrino mass ordering .",
    "such strategies would make use of a proposed upgrade to the cern super proton synchrotron ( sps ) which would equip the accelerator with fast superconducting magnets allowing high boosts and fast ramps .",
    "the latter are important to reduce the loss of ions through decay in the acceleration stage .",
    "a sister approach to the beta - beam is to use the neutrinos sourced from ions that decay mainly through electron capture  @xcite .",
    "if the electron capture decay is dominated by a single channel , then a monoenergetic electron neutrino beam can be produced this way . in this case",
    ", all the beam intensity can be concentrated at the appropriate energy to get the best sensitivity to the oscillation parameters . in order to disentangle the cp violating phase with neutrino beams only",
    ", one makes use of the different energy dependence of the cp - even and cp - odd terms in the appearance probability  @xcite .",
    "electron capture competes with @xmath23-decay when the @xmath24-value @xmath25 , @xmath26 being the electron mass . with the ions identified in  @xcite ,",
    "the use of an upgraded sps or the tevatron   is necessary to source baselines in excess of cern - frejus ( 130 km ) . in this paper , we discuss a hybrid of these two approaches .   by selecting a nuclide with @xmath27  mev , we can make use of neutrinos from an electron capture @xmath2-spike and @xmath23 continuous spectrum simultaneously . assuming a detector with low energy threshold , the use of such ions allows one to exploit the information from the first and second oscillation maxima with a single beam , in a similar way to the approach used in ref .",
    "@xcite . there",
    "the spectral information was used to remove some of the degeneracies and reach physics sensitivities comparable to the scenarios with a neutrino and antineutrino beam that are often presented in the literature .",
    "the use of the hybrid approach we propose makes it possible to use a monochromatic beam at higher energies and a beta - beam at lower energies .",
    "the need for good neutrino energy resolution at the higher energies will therefore be less crucial than for high-@xmath28 beta - beam scenarios .",

    "in this section we introduce the idea of the beta - beam and electron capture hybrid approach .",
    "we present the spectra of the two branches , their ratio and discuss two nuclides which have desirable properties .",
    "the beta - beam is a proposal , originally put forward by p.  zucchelli  @xcite , to accelerate and then store @xmath1-emitting ions , which subsequently decay to produce a well collimated , uncontaminated , electron neutrino ( or antineutrino ) beam . the high luminosities required to achieve a useful physics reach point towards ions with small proton numbers to minimise space charge and half - lives @xmath19 1  second to reduce ion losses during the acceleration stage whilst maintaining a large number of useful decays per year .",
    "the most promising candidate ions are @xmath29ne and @xmath30b for neutrinos , and @xmath31he and @xmath30li for antineutrinos .",
    "a variant on the beta - beam idea is the use of electron capture to produce monoenergetic neutrino beams .",
    "electron capture is the process in which an atomic electron is captured by a bound proton of the ion @xmath32 leading to a nuclear state of the same atomic number @xmath33 , but with the exchange of the proton by a neutron and the emission of an electron neutrino , @xmath34 the idea of using this process in neutrino experiments was independently discussed in refs .",

    "baselines of 250  km and 600  km were considered with the spectral information coming from the position of the events in the detector .",
    "sensitivities comparable to a neutrino factory were obtained for a single boost . however , in order for electron capture machines to become operational , nuclei with shorter half - life are required .",
    "the recent discovery of nuclei far from the stability line with kinematically accessible super - allowed spin - isospin transitions to giant gamow - teller resonances ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) opens up such a possibility .",
    "the rare - earth nuclei above @xmath36gd have a short enough half - life to allow electron capture processes in the decay ring , in contrast to fully - stripped long - lived ions  @xcite .",
    "this was the alternative put forward in ref .",
    "@xcite where the use of short - lived ions with @xmath37-values around 1 - 4 mev was proposed .",
    "machines such as the sps , an upgraded sps and the tevatron could then be used for the acceleration .",
    "the ion @xmath38dy , with @xmath24-value 1.4  mev , was investigated for the cern - frejus ( 130 km ) and cern - canfranc ( 650 km ) baselines and different boost factors .",
    "it was found to have very good physics reach  @xcite .",
    "owing to the monochromatic nature of the beam , multiple boosts are necessary to resolve the intrinsic degeneracy in this case .    in the following ,",
    "we demonstrate how the flux for the electron capture / beta - beam can be built up by discussing them separately and comparing branching ratios .",
    "let the mass difference between the parent and the daughter nuclei , @xmath39 , include the mass and the binding energy of an atomic electron as well . for electron capture , the maximum kinetic energy release is thus given by @xmath40 .",
    "for @xmath41-decay , however , the final nucleus has an excess electron since a positron is produced . the maximum kinetic energy release is thus given by @xmath42 .",

    "determining the value of @xmath0 , the type of neutrino mass ordering and the presence of leptonic cp - violation will be one of the main goals of the future experimental neutrino program which is under intensive discussion at present . in the present article we have studied a new type of experimental setup which combines a beta - beam with an electron capture beam .",
    "this can be achieved naturally by using nuclei which can decay into both channels .",
    "we have studied this idea using the nuclide @xmath74yb which has favourable beta - decay and electron capture branching ratios , and only a small alpha decay contribution .",
    "this combination is very powerful as the ec channel provides a high energy signal at a well known energy , while the beta - beam provides coverage of the first and second oscillation maxima .",

    "we have understood the main features of this synergy by an analytical study of the oscillation probability . it should be stressed that this setup does not require two polarities but reaches a very good sensitivity by only using the neutrino channel through full exploitation of the oscillatory pattern of the appearance probability .",
    "we have performed a detailed study of the dependence of the physics reach of this experimental technique by considering six different setups : two values for the ion boost factor @xmath83 and @xmath154 ; two choices for the detector : a 50  kton tasd or liar and a 0.5  mton wc detector ; and three baselines : cern - frejus , cern - canfranc , cern - boulby .",
    "this allowed us to study the impact of the count rate , choice of baseline and the tuning of the energy of the beta - beam and ec beam to the oscillatory pattern .",
    "we find that the setups with low gamma and 50  kton detectors have very poor physics reach , owing to the limited event rates .",

    "the sign - degeneracy prevents discovery of cp - violation in this case , see fig .",
    "[ fi : cc369clone ] .",
    "the cern - boulby setups , iv and iv - wc , suffer from smaller count rates and poor tuning of the beta - beam to the oscillation pattern .",

    "if the hierarchy is known to be normal from other neutrino experiments , the cern - canfranc option has an improved physics reach , while if the ordering is not known , the cern - boulby baseline outperforms the shorter option . for the high statistics scenario ,",
    "one gets sensitivity to cp - violation down to values of @xmath156 at 99% cl for a wc detector at canfranc , and @xmath157 for a wc detector at boulby .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have presented the novel idea of using a single beam which combines neutrinos from beta and electron capture decays and have demonstrated the physics reach of several possible setups .",
    "we have shown that the combination of these two types of beams achieves remarkable results .",
    "this could naturally be done with the use @xmath74yb , which has comparable beta - beam and electron capture branching ratios .",
    "as both beams are produced from a single isotope , this combination can not be further optimised .",
    "an analogous setup would be obtained if a beta - beam and an electron capture beam sourced from different ions are combined . in this case , further optimisation of the experiment would be allowed , for suitable choices of baselines , lorentz boost factors , detector size and technology , possibly achieving an even better physics reach than the one found in the present study .",
