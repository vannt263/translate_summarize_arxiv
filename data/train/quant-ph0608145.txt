    "entanglement distillation protocols are indispensable procedures towards the realization of many quantum communication and quantum cryptography applications , requiring pure multipartite states that are shared by remote parties @xcite .",

    "after the local clifford operations , we locally measure the @xmath2 initially pure copies , yielding information on the global state .",

    "we have presented a breeding protocol that works for any multipartite stabilizer state . starting with @xmath0 noisy copies of a stabilizer state and a pool of @xmath2 predistilled pure copies of the same state , the protocol consists of local clifford operations on noisy and pure copies , followed by local pauli measurements on the initially pure copies to extract information on the global state .",
    "the yield @xmath4 is calculated as the solution of a linear programming problem .",

    "we perform the following steps :      by corollary  [ m^tm ] , step  1 is possible provided that @xmath331 is not both full rank and zero diagonal . in that case , this can be solved by adding just one column to @xmath68 , as the resulting matrix @xmath160 then has an odd number of columns .",
