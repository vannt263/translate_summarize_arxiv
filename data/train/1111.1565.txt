    "the interactions are typically short - ranged and the samples have to be in an external confinement , most often provided by a magnetic or optical potential . in the case of a harmonic oscillator trapping potential , it turns out that the problem of two atoms interacting through a short - range potential can be exactly solved as demonstrated by busch _",

    "the pseudopotential approach has become somewhat of a paradigm itself in cold atoms .",
    "its success can largely be attributed to a seperation of scales ; the two - body collisions energy is small at the low temperatures one usually aims for , and the density of the system is also much lower than typical matter densities .",
    "one can then model the interaction using only a few low - energy parameters such as the scattering length , @xmath2 , and effective range , @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the true range of the potential , given by the van der waals length for neutral atoms , is much smaller than the interparticle spacing .",
    "the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 therefore characterize the system , and since these are independent of the shape of the two - body potential , one refers to this as a universal regime , i.e. when @xmath4 with @xmath5 the density .",
    "a really nice feature of the cold atomic gas system is the tunability of the interaction parameters through feshbach resonances @xcite , which allows one to explore the full region of parameter space , including the interesting unitarity limit where @xmath6 .    in the case of a trapped system with harmonic oscillator length , @xmath7 , a fundamental question concerns the binding energy of an @xmath8-body system in the universal regime when we also require that @xmath9 . for equal mass particles ,",

    "the general framework of effective field theory is very suitable for problems with seperation of scales , and it has been applied successfully to the three - body problem in cold atoms @xcite .",

    "we consider the general angular momentum @xmath11-wave case and derive the expression for the eigenspectrum in three dimensions as a function of the scattering phase shift . for @xmath12 , there are obstructing terms that imply a dependence on the short - range two - body potential , i.e. the spectrum is non - universal .",
    "a criterion for the applicability of the universal formula is subsequently derived . as an example",
    ", we consider a two - channel model for narrow feshbach resonances and show that interesting spectral changes occur when including the effective range term .",
    "this can be interpreted in terms of the zeldovich rearrangement effect @xcite which occurs in systems with a long - range attractive potential and a short - range two - body attraction that dominates at small distance ( some recent discussion of the effect can be found in refs .",
    "the observation of these effects in experiments require , however , extremely tight trapping potentials or extremely narrow feshbach resonances , both of which are beyond the current experimental capabilities .",
    "two - dimensional setups are currently of great interest in the cold atom community and a number of impressive experimental results have been reported recently @xcite . in the second part of the paper we consider a two - dimensional geometry and derive the eigenspectrum within the green s function approach .",
    "we find that for angular momentum @xmath13 , there are non - universal terms , i.e. a spectrum that depends on the short - range details of the two - body potential . emphasis is put on the @xmath1-wave case @xmath14 , where we find a closed formula for the spectrum in terms of the low - energy parameters of the interaction . to obtain the eigenspectrum",

    "in fact , the procedure of using a model potential to fix the phase - shift used here is similar to the self - consistent energy - dependent pseudopotential methods employed for @xmath1-waves in 3d in ref .",
    "this provides a significant improvement over the energy - independent pseudopotential in that case .    in the case of @xmath215",

    "using green s function techniques we have derived the spectrum of two particles in an isotropic harmonic trap interacting through a potential that has a range that is much smaller than the trap length scale in both three and two dimensional space . in the 3d case , the spectrum is universal , i.e. independent of the short - range details of the interaction , only for the @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave channels . for @xmath116-wave and beyond",
    "there is a dependence on the short - distance physics .",
    "we derive a general criterion for when the universal expression is valid for higher angular momenta which implies that one must be away from any resonances where the scattering length diverges . in the 2d case ,",
    "only the @xmath0-wave spectrum is truly universal , but we demonstrated that the @xmath1-wave spectrum is not very sensitive to the exact details of the interaction as long as it can accomodate a two - body bound state .",
    "the spectra in both 2d and 3d can be interpreted very nicely in terms of zeldovich rearrangement , which occurs when adding a short - range ( two - body interaciton ) to a long - range potential ( trap ) and tuning through a resonance of the short - range part . including effective range corrections in the 3d @xmath0-wave channel",
    "shows that one can get a very rich set of rearrangment points depending on the background parameters of the resonance in the short - range interaction . in the realm of cold gases , this requires use of very narrow feshbach resonances or very tight trapping conditions , both of which are currently beyond experimental capabilities but hopefully could be explored in future generation experiments .",
    "it would be interesting to extend the current formalism to polar molecules for which external trapping potential are of course also always present in experiments .",
    "a number of recent works @xcite have explored the bound state structure of such systems but it not clear how much influence a harmonic trap or an optical lattice has on these few - body states .",
