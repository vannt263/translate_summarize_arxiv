    "the physical properties of such jets have been probed mostly based on the steady state models of synchrotron radiation and inverse compton scattering by a nonthermal electron population ( ssc model ) .",
    "however , blazars are also characterized by rapid and strong time variability .",
    "recent observations have revealed that the emission exhibits short time variations in x- and gamma - ray bands on timescales from weeks down to half an hour ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for review ) , as fast time variations of mrk 421 were observed by x - rays and tev gamma - rays @xcite ; similar time variations of mrk 501 were also found by multiwavelength observations @xcite .",
    "these observations should provide important clues on physical processes in relativistic jets , in particular , on electron acceleration .    to make theoretical inferences , we need to calculate time - dependent emission spectra from a time - dependent electron population .",
    "an example of such theoretical models was recently presented by @xcite .",
    "they solved the kinetic equations of electrons and photons simultaneously , by injecting power - law electrons with an exponential cutoff .",
    "they showed various possibilities to explain the time variations observed from mrk 421 , such as the changes in the magnetic field or the maximum lorentz factor of nonthermal electrons .",
    "although the correlation between x - rays and tev gamma - rays are important to discuss the ssc model , their estimate of compton scattering in the klein - nishina regime does not necessarily correctly account for the energy change in scatterings , because of a simplified treatment of compton scattering in the klein - nishina regime [ see @xcite for the details of their calculation method ] .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , extended the above model , assuming that an acceleration region and a cooling region are spatially separated ; i.e. , electrons accelerated in a shock region are transferred to a cooling region where they emit synchrotron photons ( they did not include compton scattering ) .",
    "their model was intended to explain the time variability of x - rays , by changing acceleration timescale .    besides the time variations of flare activities explained by @xcite and @xcite , the early stages of acceleration are of great importance . by examining the properties of the time evolutions of photon spectra during acceleration ,",
    "we may obtain the diagnoses of acceleration mechanisms .",
    "the recent development of observations in x - rays ( asca and beppo - sax ) to tev gamma - rays ( e.g. , whipple and hegra ) and future experiments might be used to confirm the diagnoses .    in this paper",
    ", we use a formulation similar to @xcite , but with the full klein - nishina cross section in the compton scattering kernel , so that the emission in the tev range is calculated correctly .",
    "we also include a particle acceleration process by considering spatially separated acceleration and cooling regions as in @xcite , although we do not consider the spatial transfer of electrons .",
    "we particularly emphasize the detailed study of the properties of electron and photon spectra in the early stage of acceleration .",
    "we describe our model in  [ sec : model ] and present numerical results in  [ sec : results ] . summary of our results is given in  [ sec : summary ] .",

    "the blob is a spherical and uniform cloud with radius @xmath5 , except that the blob includes an acceleration region which is presumably a shock front .",
    "it is assumed that the spatial volume of the acceleration region is small , and that the acceleration region is a slab with thickness @xmath6 defined below .",

    "[ sec : kinetic ] .",
    "we assume that the acceleration region ( hereafter ar ) and the cooling region ( hereafter cr ) are spatially separated ; shocks in the blob are expected to be the site of electron acceleration and electrons cool mainly outside the shock regions . in the ar ,",
    "electrons are mainly accelerated and cooling is unimportant except for the highest value of @xmath7 , while , in the cr , electrons with a nonthermal spectrum are injected from the ar ; the escape rate of electrons from the ar is equal to the injection rate of electrons in the cr because of the number conservation .",
    "we further assume that acceleration time , @xmath8 , and escape time , @xmath9 , in the ar are energy independent as given in equation ( [ eq : tacc ] ) below . with these assumptions ,",
    "the number spectrum of electrons in the ar is a power law with a power - law index @xmath10 , i.e. , @xmath11 , which is confirmed analytically ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus the maximum energy of electrons is determined by the balance of cooling and acceleration . since we consider @xmath12 ( see  [ sec : results-1 ] ) , the size of the ar is much smaller than the size of the blob itself .",
    "we use this formulation because @xmath11 is expected from the theory of shock acceleration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we , however , do not solve the spatial transfer of electrons as was done by @xcite .",
    "instead , we simply calculate escaping electrons from the ar and put them into the cr .",
    "although this may be an oversimplified model for realistic situations , the actual geometrical situation of shocks is not well known , either .",
    "strictly speaking , our formulation is valid when ars and crs are more or less uniformly distributed in a cloud , but it is expected to be a fair approximation to the case where a single shock propagates in a jet as was studied by @xcite . as for the calculation of photon spectra , photons originating from one region",
    "penetrate into the other region but most of the photons originate from the cr since the size of the ar is small .",

    "electrons are then accelerated and lose energy by synchrotron radiation and compton scattering ; the energy loss rate is denoted by @xmath17 .",

    "although this expression is valid only for test particle approximation in non - relativistic shocks , we rely on this since the basic dependences are not much changed in general cases .    for the convenience of numerical calculations ,",
    "we assume @xmath8 does not depend on @xmath7 : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is assumed to be a characteristic lorentz factor of relativistic electrons and used as a parameter ; we set @xmath28 throughout this paper .",

    "[ fig : el - e3-a ] , the evolution of the electron number spectrum is shown both for an ar and a cr .",
    "it is seen that electrons injected with the lorentz factor 2 are gradually accelerated and the value of @xmath69 increases with time , where we take the value of @xmath69 such that @xmath72 for @xmath73 .",
    "the value of @xmath69 in a steady state is determined by the balance among @xmath8 , @xmath32 , and cooling time @xmath74 in the ar . because we assume @xmath75 in the ar , @xmath69 is simply determined by @xmath8 and @xmath74 .",
    "the value of @xmath69 in figure [ fig : el - e3-a ] is @xmath76 .",
    "the spectrum reaches almost a steady state within @xmath47 , which is a power law , @xmath11 ; note that @xmath77 sec and @xmath78 sec in the comoving frame of the blob for the present model .    in the cr ,",
    "the effect of electron escape is negligible in the time interval shown in figure [ fig : el - e3-a ] , because the simulation is terminated at @xmath79 while @xmath80 .",
    "because of radiative cooling , a break @xmath81 appears at around @xmath82 .",
    "this break moves to lower energy when the evolution is continued until a steady state is attained ; @xmath83 at @xmath84 .",
    "there is also a slight deceleration of electrons by cooling , which is shown by curves below @xmath85 .    the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of emission from the cr is shown in figure [ fig : ph - e3-a ] ; the flux and the photon energy are plotted in the observer s frame .",
    "curves in the figure show the time evolution , with equally spaced time interval for @xmath86 by solid curves .",

    "sed at @xmath88 ( dotted curve ) and @xmath89 ( dashed curve ) are also shown in the figure ; here electrons are continuously injected until @xmath84 .",
    "as shown by those curves , when the evolution is continued after @xmath47 , the compton component continues to increase before reaching a steady state .",
    "the peak energy of synchrotron emission initially increases but begins to decrease after about @xmath90 because electrons with @xmath91 continue to accumulate and the value of @xmath81 decreases while those with @xmath92 are saturated because of radiative cooling .",
    "after @xmath93 the effects of electron escape begin to further modify the synchrotron spectrum ; the intensity at the high energy part decreases while that at low energy still continues to increase slightly .    for @xmath94 ,",
    "light curves in the x - ray range are shown in figure [ fig : lightcv - e3-a ] .",
    "hard x - rays become dominant after @xmath95 , where @xmath96 sec in the observer s frame .",
    "the time evolution of the energy densities of electrons and photons in the cr are shown in figure [ fig : ene - e3 ] : the energy densities in the ar are comparable with those in the cr for the parameters we used . in the cr , @xmath80 and @xmath97",
    "are assumed , so that the energy density of electrons is larger than that of photons .",
    "as was mentioned above , first the synchrotron photon energy - density rapidly increases and later the compton photon energy - density ( indicated by ssc in the figure ) increases .",
    "it should be noted that the ratio of the energy densities of the compton component to the synchrotron component is about 0.7 in the final stage , while the ratio of energy densities of synchrotron photons to magnetic fields is about 9 .",
    "this is because the energy range of the target photons of compton scattering is only a part of the synchrotron spectrum due to the klein - nishina limit .",
    "this result implies that we should be cautious about the estimate of the magnetic field strength from observations ; if we simply estimate the magnetic field by multiplying the energy density of synchrotron photons by the ratio of synchrotron luminosity to compton luminosity , it results in a large overestimation of magnetic field .",
    "the energy injected through the electron acceleration is finally carried away by electrons and photons from the blob .",
    "the ratio of the amounts of the energies carried by electrons and photons is about @xmath98 in a steady state ( i.e. , @xmath99 ) .",
    "that is , electrons carry more jet power than radiation in this specific model .",
    "the trajectories in the energy - flux _ vs. _ photon - index plane are shown for @xmath51  @xmath89 in figure [ fig : alpha - e3 ] for various energy bands . because the value of @xmath69 decreases due to radiative cooling , the flux of x - rays decreases when @xmath100 @xmath101 a few @xmath47 .",
    "the flux of gamma - rays , on the other hand , continues to increase because of compton scattering ( see figure [ fig : ph - e3-a ] ) .      by changing the value of @xmath23",

    "[ fig : el - e3 - 8 - 9 ] , steady - state distributions of electrons for different values of @xmath23 are compared . when the acceleration time scale is longer , the value of @xmath69 is reduced because of radiative cooling in the ar .",
    "consequently , the emission spectrum becomes softer ( figure [ fig : ph - e3 - 8 - 9 ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that because a smaller value of @xmath23 leads to a smaller value of @xmath66 in out model , the luminosity from a blob becomes smaller when @xmath23 is smaller .",
    "the extreme limit of @xmath102 corresponding to the bhm limit results in the most efficient compton luminosity and the highest gamma - ray energy . in this limit",
    ", @xmath69 is about @xmath103 and the inverse compton sed shows a steep cut off at @xmath104 tev for @xmath56 if electron - positron pair production is neglected .",
    "note that @xmath8 in reality depends on @xmath7 , while we assume @xmath8 does not depend on @xmath7 and the above values were calculated assuming @xmath28 in equation ( [ eq : tacc ] ) .",
    "the shape of sed has a significant curvature in the tev region in our calculations .",
    "this curvature is in contrast to the observations of tev gamma - rays from mrk 421 , which are fitted by a power law @xcite .",
    "mrk 501 , on the other hand , show a curvature in tev emission @xcite , and there are models which explain the curvature by intergalactic absorption ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we , however , do not address these issues in this paper , since we are mainly interested in the temporal behavior of electrons and photons due to electron acceleration in the source .",
    "the spectral energy distributions of electrons and photons depend on the value of the injection rate @xmath31 in the ar as well . if the value of @xmath31 is larger with the fixed values of @xmath15 , @xmath32 , and @xmath8 , the accumulation of electrons in the cr increases , resulting in the dominance of the compton component .",
    "an example of sed is shown [ fig : ph - e4-e3 ] , where the electron injection rate in the acceleration smaller by a factor 10 than in the model shown in figure [ fig : ph - e3-a ] , i.e. , electrons are injected at the rate of @xmath105 electrons @xmath62 sec@xmath55 .",
    "the peak of the synchrotron component decreases by a factor 10 and that of the compton component decreases by a factor 100 .      when the size of a cloud and the number density of electrons are fixed , the value of @xmath69 is larger for smaller values of @xmath21 , because the synchrotron cooling rate is proportional to @xmath106 .",
    "however , this is not the case in our model , because not only the cooling rate but also @xmath8 depends on b. when @xmath21 is smaller , @xmath8 is larger , which results in the larger size of the ar . because we fix the particle injection rate per unit volume in the ar , the total number of electrons injected into the cr per unit time is larger by the electron number conservation . as a result ,",
    "the compton cooling in the cr becomes stronger and the value of @xmath69 becomes smaller .",
    "however , the increase or decrease of @xmath69 actually depends on the combination of synchrotron cooling and compton cooling .",
    "such dependence on @xmath21 in the cr is shown in figure [ fig : light - b05-g2 ] ; seds at @xmath84 are compared for @xmath107 , @xmath61 , and @xmath108 g with the same values of other parameters as in figure [ fig : ph - e3-a ] . in the cr ,",
    "the values of @xmath69 are @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 for @xmath107 , @xmath61 , and @xmath108 g , respectively .",
    "it is conceivable that acceleration is terminated by the end of electron injection in the ar due to the change of shock structure , etc .",
    ", so that plasmas cease to emit hard photons .",
    "to exemplify such a situation , we continue the injection and acceleration up to @xmath112 with the parameters used in figure [ fig : el - e3-a ] and terminate the injection and the acceleration abruptly at @xmath112 , while the simulation is continued until @xmath113 .",
    "a break of the power - law spectrum of electrons in the ar appears after acceleration is terminated , and the break moves to lower energy with time .",
    "the response of the emission spectrum to the termination of acceleration is almost simultaneous in different energy bands as shown by light curves in figure [ fig : light - e3-c ] .",
    "it is observed that the decay at 0.5  2 kev band lags that at 2  40 kev , which is characteristic to the models that assume the injection of power - law electrons and a sudden termination of injection .",
    "the decay in the kev range and 1  10 tev bands is exponential , because the supply of the electrons producing those photons is turned off . on the other hand ,",
    "electrons producing gev photons are still supplied for a while by the cooling of the highest energy electrons which produced 1  10 tev photons .      up to now , we have assumed that at the initial stage the cloud is empty and there are no high energy electrons or photons .",
    "this is certainly an over simplification .",
    "many flare events have been observed in x- and gamma - ray ranges by asca , whipple , etc .",
    "they are overlaid on a steady emission component . as an example of applications of our code ,",
    "a flare is simulated , i.e. , we simply change the value of @xmath8 for a period of time .",
    "more specifically , at @xmath51 the distributions of electrons and photons are in the steady state which is obtained for the parameters used in ",
    "[ sec : results-1 ] ; see the dashed curve in figure [ fig : ph - e3-a ] for the steady photon energy distribution .",
    "the steady state is still continued for @xmath47 .",
    "we then replace @xmath8 by @xmath114 for @xmath115 ( about 14 hours in the observer s frame ) ; after @xmath88 , the original value of @xmath8 is used .",
    "the electron escape time in the ar is also changed keeping @xmath116 . in figure",
    "[ fig : light - flare ] , light curves are shown for such a flare .",
    "the response of the light curves to the change of @xmath8 ( on / off of a flare ) is slightly delayed , because of photon production and compton scattering time .",
    "it is also noticed that the change of the light curve at @xmath117 gev band delays behind x - rays and tev gamma - rays . this is a result of an interplay of the time evolution of electron and synchrotron photon spectra .",
    "it is shown that the light curves of 2  10 and 10  40 kev proceed that of 0.5  2 kev .",
    "this behavior is different from that shown in figure [ fig : lightcv - e3-a ] , where the initial condition was an empty blob .",
    "the trajectories in the energy flux and photon index are shown in figure [ fig : alpha - flare ] for @xmath118  @xmath89 .",
    "this behavior is qualitatively similar to observed one for mrk 421 by asca @xcite",
    ". though the amplitudes of the change in the photon index of 2  10 kev and its energy flux are different from those of the observation , these values are dependent on parameters such as @xmath8 and the duration of the flare , etc .",
    "simulations of the time evolution of electron and photon energy distributions were presented as a model of time variations observed by x- and gamma - rays from blazars . by assuming that acceleration and cooling regions in a blob are spatially separated , we calculated the energy spectra of electrons in each regions .",
    "electrons in the acceleration region are accelerated with a characteristic timescale @xmath8 and escape on a timescale @xmath32 ; here we assumed @xmath75 , so that the electron spectrum in a steady state obeys a power law , @xmath11 , as realized in the standard model of shock acceleration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "electrons escaping from the acceleration region are injected into the cooling region where they lose energy by radiation and finally escape from the blob on a timescale assumed to be @xmath119 . with these assumptions , we performed the simulations of the time evolutions of electrons and photons for various values of parameters .",
    "although we did not include a specific acceleration mechanism , we took into account the salient features of diffusive shock acceleration , so that we could study the properties of time variation accompanying shock acceleration .",
    "we first presented the results of the time evolution of the spectral energy distribution of radiation associated with the evolution of the electron number spectrum . in the early stage of the evolution ,",

    "our formulation provides a method to treat high energy flares including particle acceleration processes , which is beyond usual analyses where nonthermal electron spectra are arbitrarily assumed and only cooling processes are included . although we have not applied our model to any specific case of flares , it is straightforward to do this using our code .",
