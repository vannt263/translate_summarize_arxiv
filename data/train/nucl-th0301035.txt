    "according to the eq.([eq6 ] ) , most part of the total routhian energy , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84(@xmath85 @xmath86 ) are plotted in fig.3 .",
    "fig.3(a ) and fig.3(b ) show the trs elements of proton and neutron in @xmath60kr , respectively .",
    "the energy scale of the contour lines is 0.28mev .    in fig.3(a1 )",
    ", the surface of proton rotational energy is flat and the deformation of the local minimum is small .",
    "therefore , the proton rotating energy can not affect the formation of tsd shape . in fig.3(a2 ) , although the proton shell correction energy has two deep minimums , the proton pairing correction energy , shown in fig.3(a3 ) , has two high peeks near the minimum in fig.3(a ) and canceled the minimum of shell correction energy . the sum of the three type of energy , @xmath87 , shown in fig.3(a4 ) , is flat in the center part of the surface .",
    "this means that the proton properties in @xmath88kr is helpless to form tsd nuclei",
    ".    however , the neutron properties , shown in fig.3(b ) , is different from fig.3(a ) .",
    "the neutron rotational energy , shown in fig.3(b1 ) decreases sharply with increasing large @xmath89 deformation and therefore has a strong driving effect towards large elongation deformation . in fig.3(b2 ) , the neutron shell correction has two minimums but were canceled by the pairing energy shown in fig.3(b3 ) .",
    "thus , the driving force in large quadrupole deformation is remained .",
    "summing the three neutron parts of total routhian energy , @xmath90 , we obtain fig.3(b4 ) .",
    "this figure is most similar to fig.3(b1 ) , having small driving effect to spherical deformation and large driving effect to large quadrupole deformation .",
    "this is very important for @xmath60kr to form tsd shape .",
    "fig.4 shows the sum of liquid drop energy and @xmath90 .",
    "a large quadrupole and triaxial minimum appeared on this surface .",
    "since the @xmath87 is flat in this region , the minimum shown in fig.4 exists also in the total routhian surface , see fig.1 . in the formation of tsd shape ,",
    "the rotational energy plays a crucial role .",
    "because the neutron shell correction energy also decreases sharply in large deformation , it also has the additional role to form tsd shape .    to confirm that the reason is also effective for other nuclei in @xmath32 region , we also analyzed @xmath91se which is predicted to have tsd shape and @xmath92kr which is predicted to have no tsd shape .",
    "the results supported our analysis of the formation mechanism of tsd nuclei that the rotational energy plays a key role and neutron shell energy plays an additional role in the formation of tsd nuclei .",
    "the following convection is used : solid lines : ( @xmath93 ) , dotted lines : ( @xmath94 ) , dash - dotted lines : ( @xmath95 ) and dashed lines : ( @xmath96).,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ] [ fig5 ]    it has been pointed out that the rotational energy is the difference between the expectation value of @xmath47 ( eq.([eq5 ] ) ) with and without rotation .",
    "when the rotational frequency is high , the pair of protons and/or neutrons will be broken and their angular momentum alignment will affect the rotational energy . in order to see the broken pair of protons and neutrons , the calculated q.p .",
    "routhians are presented in fig.5(a ) for protons and fig.5(b ) for neutrons . in fig.5(a ) , [ 431]3/2 orbit crosses with the [ 440]1/2 orbit at @xmath97 for protons , while  in fig.5(b ) ,  [ 420]1/2 orbit crosses with the [ 413]7/2 orbit for both @xmath98 in @xmath99 for neutrons .",
    "therefore , when @xmath60kr rotates at @xmath100 , there is one proton pair and two neutron pairs are broken and this will take effect on the rotational energy .",
    "compared with the analysis of tsd nuclei in @xmath31 region , the quadrupole deformation parameters of predicted tsd nuclei in @xmath32 region are larger than those in @xmath31 region . and also , the formation mechanism is different between the two regions . in @xmath31 region ,",
    "the neutron shell correction energy controls the formation of tsd nuclei , while in @xmath32 region , rotating energy , which include the effect of q.p .",
    "angular momentum alignments , controls the formation of tsd nuclei .",
    "in summary ,  fixing the rotational frequency @xmath34 as @xmath101,11 nuclei are predicted to have triaxial superdeformation under the condition of @xmath102 and @xmath75 by the three dimensional trs calculation in @xmath32 region . most of these tsd nuclei are located in the @xmath79 region , only @xmath80mo is a exceptional . by analyzing the formation mechanism of tsd nuclei in the @xmath32 region ,",
    "we find that the neutron rotational energy which includes the contribution of quasiparticle angular momentum alignment plays a key role to form tsd nuclei and the neutron shell energy plays additional role ."
