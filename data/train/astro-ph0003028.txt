    "the existence of disks around young stars was spectacularly confirmed by direct images from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) ( mccaughrean & odell 1996 ; burrows et  al .",
    "observations suggest that young stars are usually found in binary systems and that young binaries typically interact strongly with the disks that surround the stars ( ghez , neugebauer , & matthews 1993 ; mathieu 1994 ; osterloh & beckwith 1995 ; jensen , mathieu , & fuller 1996 ) .",
    "there is growing evidence that disks within a binary are sometimes inclined with respect to the binary orbital plane .",
    "such a case may have been seen in _",
    "hst _ and keck images of a disk in the young binary hk tau ( stapelfeldt et  al .",
    "1998 ; koresko 1998 ) .",
    "suppose that a protostellar disk surrounds a star in a circular - orbit binary system , and that the disk is tilted with respect to the binary orbital plane .",
    "the evolution of the disk is affected by the tidal field of the companion star , as has been considered by papaloizou & terquem ( 1995 ) .",
    "some features of their analysis were confirmed in three - dimensional numerical simulations by larwood et  al .",
    "the basic physics involved may be summarized as follows ( see also bate et al .",
    "2000 ) . in a non - rotating frame of reference centered on the star about which",
    "the disk orbits , the companion star orbits at the binary frequency @xmath2 and exerts a time - dependent tidal torque on the disk .",
    "this torque may be decomposed into a steady component and an oscillatory component with a frequency of @xmath3 , and their effects may be considered separately .",
    "consider first the steady torque .",
    "if the disk were composed of non - interacting circular rings , the steady torque would cause each ring to precess , about an axis perpendicular to the binary plane , at a rate that depends on the radius of the ring , resulting in a rapid twisting of the disk .",
    "if the disk is able to maintain efficient radial communication , whether by wave propagation , viscosity , or self - gravitation , it may be able to resist this differential precession by establishing an internal torque in the disk . this can be arranged so that the net torque on each ring is such as to produce a single , uniform precession rate .",
    "however , to establish this internal torque , the disk must become warped .",
    "the concomitant dissipation changes the total angular momentum of the disk , tending to bring it into alignment with the binary plane in addition to causing accretion .",
    "consider now the oscillatory torque",
    ". applied to a single ring , this would cause a modulation of the precession rate and also a nutation ( katz et  al .",
    "however , in the presence of radial communication , the oscillatory torque drives a bending wave ( with azimuthal wavenumber @xmath4 ) in the disk .",
    "papaloizou & terquem ( 1995 ) showed that , if the wave is subject to dissipation , it too may change the total angular momentum of the disk and tend to increase its inclination .",
    "the net effect of the steady and oscillatory torques determines whether an initially coplanar disk will acquire a tilt over time or whether an initially inclined disk will evolve towards coplanarity .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to determine this outcome , which could provide clues to the origin of misaligned disks in systems such as hk tau .",
    "the basic mechanism suggested by papaloizou & terquem for generating a tilt by the oscillatory torque can be related to earlier work by lubow ( 1992 ) , who showed that an aligned , keplerian disk in a circular binary may be linearly unstable to tilting if it contains a local resonance at which the orbital angular velocity @xmath5 satisfies @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the azimuthal wavenumber of the component of the tidal potential that is involved in the instability cycle .",
    "the cycle works through a mode - coupling process as follows : given a perturbation with @xmath4 ( a tilt ) , the tidal potential interacts with it to a drive a wave with @xmath8 at the resonant radius .",
    "this in turn interacts with the tidal potential to produce a stress with @xmath4 , which can influence the tilt .",
    "the role of dissipation is subtle , since some dissipation is required to provide a change in the angular momentum of the disk if instability is to occur , yet the associated damping can compete with the intrinsic growth rate of the instability",
    ".    in particular , if the disk extends to the @xmath9 resonance ( @xmath10 ) it may be unstable to tilting through the @xmath11 component of the tidal potential .",
    "this resonance has the smallest @xmath7 for which equation ( [ resonance ] ) can be satisfied ( for a prograde disk ) and is the closest resonance to the central star .",
    "it is difficult for disks to extend even as far as the @xmath9 resonance , because of the effects of tidal truncation ( paczyski 1977 ; papaloizou & pringle 1977 ) .",
    "superhump binary disks might extend to the @xmath9 resonance because of their extreme binary mass ratios , the secondary companion having less than @xmath12 the mass of the primary about which the disk orbits ( see the review by osaki 1996 ) .",
    "this instability is related to , and occurs at the same position as , the eccentric instability that is believed to be responsible for superhumps in cataclysmic variable disks ( lubow 1991 ) . however , the growth rate is invariably much smaller for tilting than for eccentricity , and the weak tilt instability may be suppressed by the effects of viscous damping and accretion ( murray & armitage 1998 ) .",
    "the same instabilities had been previously identified in the context of planetary rings for higher @xmath7 ( goldreich & tremaine 1981 ; borderies , goldreich , & tremaine 1984 ) . more fundamentally , free - particle orbits undergo even stronger , parametric instabilities at these resonant locations ( paczyski 1977 ) , although free particles fail to model properly the behavior of a fluid disk at resonances .",
    "we relate this theory to the suggestion of papaloizou & terquem ( 1995 ) by noticing in equation ( [ resonance ] ) that , for @xmath13 , a near resonance is obtained in the inner part of the disk where @xmath14 .",
    "indeed , papaloizou & terquem rely on the @xmath1 component of the tidal potential to drive an @xmath4 bending wave in the tilted disk .",
    "the resulting response is a slowly rotating @xmath4 bending wave , with frequency @xmath3 in the inertial frame .",
    "such a wave is close to resonance in the inner part of a nearly keplerian disk because of the near coincidence of the effective wave driving frequency @xmath15 and the frequency of vertical oscillations @xmath16 ; this is indeed the origin of equation ( [ resonance ] ) with @xmath13 .",
    "an additional resonant effect occurs owing to the near coincidence of the driving frequency and the epicyclic frequency of horizontal oscillations @xmath17 .",
    "we describe the instability cycle associated with the oscillatory torque as a mode - coupling process in fig .  1 .",
    "however , because the resonance is not exact , and because of the importance of resonantly induced horizontal motions , a proper treatment requires a distinct analysis from that of lubow ( 1992 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we therefore examine whether a flat , aligned disk in a binary is linearly unstable to tilting even if it does not extend to the @xmath9 resonance .",
    "this problem is most conveniently analyzed in the binary frame where the tidal potential is static , since the disk can then be considered to be steady and to admit normal modes .",
    "these modes do not have a pure azimuthal wavenumber because the disk is non - axisymmetric as a result of tidal distortions .",
    "however , the tilting instability , if present , may be expected to appear as a modification of the rigid - tilt mode , which is trivial in the absence of the companion star .",
    "this mode may be followed continuously as the mass of the companion is increased , in order to determine whether it acquires a net rate of growth or decay .    in general ,",
    "the analysis of a normal mode of a tidally distorted disk is very difficult owing to the non - axisymmetric distortions of the disk .",
    "we therefore adopt the following simple approach , which is appropriate when only @xmath4 bending waves are involved .",
    "we start by writing down the reduced equations for linear bending waves in a protostellar disk subject to an axisymmetric external potential ( section  2 ) .",
    "these can be derived formally without great effort ( see the appendix ) .",
    "we then give a physical interpretation of these equations and use this insight to see how to modify them in the presence of a non - axisymmetric potential ( sections  3 and  4 ) .",
    "we present a simple disk model ( section  5 ) and describe the results of numerical calculations of normal modes ( section  6 ) .",
    "some further analysis illuminates the underlying physics and helps to explain the numerical results ( section  7 ) .",
    "finally , we summarize our findings ( section  8) .",
    "consider a thin , non - self - gravitating disk in an external gravitational potential @xmath18 that is axisymmetric , but not necessarily spherically symmetric . here",
    "@xmath19 are cylindrical polar coordinates .",
    "the orbital angular velocity @xmath5 , the epicyclic frequency @xmath20 , and the vertical frequency @xmath21 are defined by as a result of the radial pressure gradient and the vertical variation of the potential .",
    "such departures generally depend on @xmath22 and are of fractional order @xmath23 .",
    "they are fully taken into account in the analysis in the appendix . ]",
    "@xmath24 we consider a situation in which the disk is nearly keplerian and almost inviscid in the sense that @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the semi - thickness of the disk and @xmath27 the dimensionless viscosity parameter .",
    "then the linearized equations for bending waves ( with azimuthal wavenumber @xmath4 ) may be written @xmath28=    { { 1}\\over{r}}{{\\partial g}\\over{\\partial r } } ,    \\label{dwdt}\\ ] ] @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the surface density and @xmath31 the second vertical moment of the density , defined by @xmath32 the second moment is related to the integrated pressure through @xmath33 the dimensionless complex variable @xmath34 is defined by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the tilt vector , a unit vector parallel to the local angular momentum vector of the disk .",
    "the complex variable @xmath37 represents the internal torque which acts to communicate stresses radially through the disk ( see below ) .",
    "the derivation of these equations may be found in the appendix .",
    "equivalent equations , although presented in quite different notations , have been derived by papaloizou & lin ( 1995 ) and demianski & ivanov ( 1997 ) .",
    "in addition to conditions ( [ criterion1])([criterion3 ] ) , it is required that the warp vary on a length - scale long compared to the thickness of the disk , and on a time - scale long compared to the local orbital time - scale .",
    "however , any evolution of the disk on the ( much longer ) viscous time - scale is neglected .",
    "the ( dynamic ) viscosity is assumed to be isotropic and proportional to the pressure ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "we emphasize the physical interpretation of these equations .",
    "equation ( [ dwdt ] ) contains the horizontal components of the angular momentum equation encoded in the combination ` @xmath39 ' . in vectorial form",
    "it may be written @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the internal torque and @xmath42 the external torque density acting on the disk . in the present case",
    "the external torque arises from a lack of spherical symmetry in the potential .",
    "the complex variable @xmath43 is simply @xmath44 .",
    "its equation may be written , in vectorial form , @xmath45 the internal torque is mediated by horizontal epicyclic motions that are driven near resonance by horizontal pressure gradients in the warped disk , an effect identified by papaloizou & pringle ( 1983 ) .",
    "the horizontal motions are proportional to @xmath22 and are therefore subject to strong viscous dissipation which is the dominant channel of damping of the bending waves .",
    "we note that slowly varying @xmath4 bending waves or warps may be quite generally described by conservation equations for mass and angular momentum ( pringle 1992 ; ogilvie 1999 ) .",
    "the relevant relation of @xmath46 to @xmath47 and its derivatives , however , depends strongly on the thickness of the disk , the viscosity , and the rotation law . in this paper",
    "we are considering a parameter range appropriate to protostellar disks , and are assuming that the warping is small so that a linear theory is valid . for disks",
    "in which @xmath48 , see papaloizou & pringle ( 1983 ) , pringle ( 1992 ) , and ogilvie ( 1999 , 2000 ) .",
    "there are two dynamical degrees of freedom in the system described by the above equations .",
    "one is the tilting of the disk at each radius according to the tilt vector @xmath47 .",
    "the other is the horizontal motions described by @xmath46 , which cause eccentric distortions of the disk that are proportional to @xmath22 . in spite of this complexity , the external torque density @xmath49 in equation ( [ dldt ] )",
    "is very simple ( cf .",
    "eq .  [ [ dwdt ] ] ) : it is equal to the torque exerted by the external potential on a disk composed of arbitrarily thin circular rings of uniform density that are tilted according the tilt vector @xmath47 .",
    "the eccentric distortions may be disregarded when calculating the external torque to the required order .",
    "we proceed to derive an expression for the torque exerted by the full potential of the companion star ( of mass @xmath50 ) on a tilted ring of the disk , treated as a thin and narrow circular ring of radius @xmath51 and uniform density .",
    "adopt cartesian coordinates @xmath52 with origin at the center of the ring , and with the ring in the @xmath53-plane .",
    "then the position of an arbitrary point on the ring is @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the azimuthal angle measured around the ring .",
    "assume , without loss of generality , that the companion star lies instantaneously in the @xmath56-plane at position @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the binary radius and @xmath59 the angle of inclination .",

    "the damping rate depends relatively little on the order of the mode .",
    "it can be seen from the governing equations that the effect of viscosity is simply to damp the horizontal motions locally at a rate @xmath201 ( cf .",

    "the frequency of the mode ( now the ` modified ' rigid - tilt mode ) changes continuously from @xmath203 to @xmath204 .",
    "the mode also acquires a @xmath195 component .",
    "viewed in the inertial frame , the mode changes from a pure @xmath188 mode with zero frequency to a combination of @xmath188 and @xmath195 contributions having frequencies of @xmath205 and @xmath206 , respectively ( see eq .",
    "[ [ hatl ] ] ) .",
    "the first frequency corresponds to a retrograde precession of the tilted disk , forced by the @xmath0 component of the tidal potential .",
    "the second corresponds to the forcing of a bending wave ( @xmath195 ) by the @xmath1 component of the potential .",

    "the other modes of the disk are of course damped much more rapidly , and we conclude that the reference model disk is linearly stable to tilting .",
    "we now search the parameter space around the reference model for any regions of instability .",
    "in particular , we try varying the outer radius @xmath111 of the disk . in fig .  2 we plot the dimensionless growth rate @xmath208 against @xmath120 for a number of different values of @xmath27",
    "it is clear that the net growth rate is a combination of two parts .",
    "one part is a damping ( @xmath209 ) that is proportional to @xmath27 and increases rapidly with increasing @xmath111 .",
    "the second part is a growth ( @xmath210 ) with an entirely different behavior .",
    "the growth is localized in a sequence of peaks which become higher and narrower as @xmath27 decreases . in fig .",
    "3 we show an expanded view of the primary peak for the cases @xmath178 and @xmath211 .    to verify the origin of the two parts , we repeated the calculation using equations that retain only the @xmath0 component of the tidal potential , or only the @xmath1 component .",

    "there is a slight shift in the positions of the peaks when the @xmath0 component of the tidal potential is neglected .",
    "it is evident that the growth ( that is , the instability ) is associated with a series of resonances that occur when the outer radius of the disk is in the vicinity of certain discrete values . in the absence of viscosity , the resonances come about as follows . as @xmath120 is varied , the frequency eigenvalues of all bending modes migrate along the real axis in the @xmath82-plane . with the exception of mode @xmath125 ,",
    "all modes are very sensitive to the position of the outer boundary , which reflects the waves . as a result",
    ", collisions occur on the real axis .",
    "in particular , when @xmath120 is increased from @xmath117 towards the primary resonance , mode @xmath125 undergoes a collision with mode @xmath130 ( a bending mode with one node ) .",
    "the modes move briefly off the real axis , producing a complex - conjugate pair , and then return to the real axis to continue their original migration .",
    "the other resonances occur when mode @xmath125 undergoes collisions with modes @xmath138 , @xmath146 , etc . during a collision ,",
    "the two modes exchange characteristics , and the eigenfunctions are hybrids of the two original ones .",
    "in particular , mode @xmath125 no longer resembles a rigid tilt during a collision with a proper bending mode .",
    "this means that a disk made unstable by this means would develop a warped shape ( see section 6.4 below ) .    in the presence of a very small viscosity ,",
    "the proper bending modes are damped and their eigenvalues are displaced somewhat above the real axis .",
    "the collisions are no longer exact and each mode can be followed continuously as @xmath120 is varied . for @xmath211 , say , the modes pass sufficiently close that a strong interaction occurs .",
    "the tracks of the eigenvalues are deflected to avoid a collision , and , in so doing , mode @xmath125 acquires a positive growth rate that appears as a resonance . during the interaction , the eigenfunction of mode @xmath125 is distorted significantly from a rigid tilt , but not so strongly as in the inviscid case ( see section  6.4 below ) .",
    "when the viscosity is increased , the resonances become broader and weaker .",
    "a positive growth rate is not achieved if the height of the resonance is less than the damping rate arising from the @xmath0 potential .",
    "therefore the regions of instability are suppressed as @xmath27 is increased .",
    "it appears that , as long as the primary resonance survives , the net growth rate ( for @xmath212 ) is always positive for disks smaller than the size of the primary resonance , although the growth rate may be minuscule .",
    "this may be considered as a long tail of the primary resonance .",
    "however , the primary peak is dramatically reduced in height as @xmath27 is increased , and it also shifts to smaller radius . in the cases investigated here , all traces of instability are eliminated when @xmath213 .    to elucidate further the condition for resonance",
    ", we examined the bending modes at their points of collision with mode @xmath125 and evaluated their natural frequencies ( i.e. in the absence of the tidal potential , and evaluated in the inertial frame ) . in each case",
    "the natural frequency is close to @xmath3 at the point of collision .",
    "the resonances therefore occur when the oscillatory torque due to the @xmath1 potential resonates with a free bending mode of the disk .",
    "we remark that the global resonant excitation of bending waves has been identified by terquem ( 1998 ) when calculating the tidal torque exerted on a protostellar disk by a companion in an inclined circular orbit .",
    "however , the consequences for the evolution of the relative inclination of the system were not investigated .",
    "the results for a companion in a retrograde orbit are not significantly different .",
    "the heights of the resonant peaks are very similar , but they are shifted slightly in radius .",
    "the shift of the resonances ( also observed , as noted above , when the @xmath0 component of the tidal potential is omitted ) is related to the precession of the disk , which changes the effective frequency of the oscillatory torque and , therefore , the condition for resonance .",
    "the precession is always retrograde in the inertial frame , irrespective of the sense of the companion s orbit .",
    "therefore the effective driving frequency depends on the sense of the orbit , but the shift is generally small .      in fig .",
    "4 we plot the precession rate of the modified rigid - tilt mode against the outer radius of the disk , for the reference model .",
    "the precession is always retrograde and the rate increases rapidly with increasing @xmath111 .",
    "excellent agreement is found with the simple analytic approximation given by bate et  al .",
    "( 2000 ; eq .  [ 22 ] ) .",
    "( we have set the dimensionless parameter @xmath214 , since this represents fairly accurately the disk models we have adopted . ) for much smaller values of @xmath27 , a noticeable deviation from this curve occurs in the vicinity of resonances , since the path of the eigenvalue in the @xmath82-plane is temporarily diverted .    in fig .",
    "5 we plot the decay rate of the modified rigid - tilt mode , for the reference model .",
    "when only the @xmath0 component of the tidal potential is included , the decay rate is always positive and increases rapidly with increasing @xmath111 .",
    "when the full potential is used , the behavior is modified in the vicinity of resonances .",
    "also shown is the simple estimate @xmath215 given by bate et  al .",
    "( 2000 ; eq .  [ 35 ] )",
    ". apart from the resonances , the simple estimate captures the correct dependence on @xmath111 .",
    "it should be borne in mind that the estimate of bate et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) was based on an order - of - magnitude analysis , and can be expected to be accurate only within a factor of order unity .      for comparison with observations , it is of interest to examine the shape adopted by the disk while executing the modified rigid - tilt mode .",
    "information on the shape of the disk is contained in four real functions of radius , namely the real and imaginary parts of the eigenfunctions @xmath216 and @xmath217 .",
    "we display this information in figs  6 and  7 by showing cross - sections through the disk in the @xmath56- and @xmath218-planes at two instants , corresponding to phase @xmath125 and phase @xmath219 of the period seen in the binary frame .",
    "6 is for a disk with @xmath220 , in the middle of the primary resonance .",
    "three different viscosities , @xmath178 , @xmath211 , and @xmath221 , are considered . in each case",
    "the mode has a positive growth rate . in the absence of viscosity , the resonance is strong and the disk becomes distinctly warped in a smooth and global manner .",
    "as already noted , when viscosity is included , the resonance is much weaker and the disk appears tilted with less noticeable warping .",
    "7 is for a disk with the reference value @xmath222 representative of a tidally truncated disk .",
    "we fix @xmath221 and consider disks of varying thickness , @xmath223 , @xmath224 , and @xmath225 . in each case",
    "the mode is damped .",
    "for @xmath223 , the disk appears tilted without noticeable warping . for thinner disks ,",
    "the deviation from a rigid tilt is noticeable in the outer part of the disk where the tidal forcing is strongest .",
    "recall that the derivation of equations ( [ dldt ] ) and ( [ dgvecdt ] ) requires that the warp vary on a length - scale long compared to the thickness of the disk ( see the appendix ) .",
    "this condition is indeed satisfied in the solutions we present here .",
    "the normal - mode description affords an especially compact representation of the dynamics and is very suitable for the numerical analysis . in this section",
    "we ` unpack ' the eigenfunction to reveal the essential physics of the problem .",
    "we write the basic equations in the general form @xmath226 @xmath227 with unspecified coefficients @xmath228 , @xmath229 , @xmath230 , and @xmath231 arising from the tidal potential . in view of our earlier discussion , terms @xmath228 and @xmath230 are due to the @xmath0 component of the potential , while the non - analytic terms @xmath229 and @xmath231 are due to the @xmath1 component . we allow for the possibility that tidal distortions of the disk may introduce additional complexities ( such as a term @xmath231 ) that we have not foreseen .    for a normal mode of the form ( [ wpm])([gpm ] )",
    ", we have @xmath232 @xmath233      we now expand the equations in powers of the tidal potential , indicated by a numerical superscript .",
    "the unspecified coefficients may be assumed to have expansions @xmath234 etc .",
    ", since they vanish in the absence of the tidal potential .",
    "the eigenvalue and eigenfunction have the expansions @xmath235 where , at leading order , we have the rigid - tilt mode with @xmath236 the rigid - tilt amplitude could be arbitrarily specified as @xmath237 , but we retain @xmath238 for clarity in the equations below .      at first order , we obtain @xmath239 @xmath240 @xmath241 @xmath242 from equation ( [ expand1 ] ) , using the fact that @xmath43 vanishes at the edges of the disk , we immediately obtain the solvability condition @xmath243 which relates the precession rate ( at first order ) to the total horizontal tidal torque on the disk ( at first order ) divided by the horizontal angular momentum of the tilted disk .",
    "this effect is due to @xmath228 and therefore to the @xmath0 component of the tidal potential",
    ". equations ( [ expand1])([expand4 ] ) can then , in principle , be solved for @xmath244 and @xmath245 .    at second order",
    ", we obtain @xmath246 plus three further equations , which will not be required .",
    "this time the solvability condition is @xmath247 if , as we assume , @xmath228 is real , then @xmath248 is real .",
    "after some further manipulations we then obtain @xmath249 this shows that @xmath250 , which is caused by the @xmath0 component of the potential , causes pure damping , while @xmath251 , which is caused by the @xmath1 component , causes pure growth .",
    "the net effect depends on which is larger in the norm defined above .",
    "note that coefficients @xmath230 and @xmath231 have no effect to this order . also , the second - order coefficient @xmath252 , which we did not attempt to calculate , does not affect the growth or decay rate at second order ( although it does affect the precession frequency at second order ) .",
    "such a coefficient could arise because the tidal torque on a tilted ring may have a second - order correction owing to the tidal distortion of the ring .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath250 is independent of @xmath27 according to equation ( [ expand1 ] ) , the damping is simply proportional to @xmath27 .",
    "the dependence of the growth on @xmath27 is less clear since @xmath251 itself depends on @xmath27 in a complicated way according to the coupled equations ( [ expand2 ] ) and ( [ expand4 ] ) .",
    "some insight into these equations is obtained by considering the case @xmath178 , for which we find @xmath253 for our disk model , we have approximately @xmath254 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 over most of the disk .",
    "we then obtain , approximately , @xmath255 where @xmath256^{1/3}r_{\\rm b } ,    \\label{lambda}\\ ] ] and @xmath103 is the angular semi - thickness @xmath257 of the disk .",
    "this is an inhomogeneous airy equation such as is common in problems of resonant wave excitation in differentially rotating disks . here",
    ", the resonance is at the exact center of the disk , in accord with equation ( [ resonance ] ) . the forcing term on the right - hand side , however , is proportional to @xmath258 and is therefore concentrated in the outer parts of the disk .",
    "the magnitude of the response @xmath259 ( and therefore @xmath251 ) depends on the overlap between the forcing function and the solutions of the homogeneous equation , @xmath260 and @xmath261 .",
    "one may then distinguish two cases , depending on whether the outer radius @xmath111 satisfies @xmath262 or @xmath263 .    if @xmath262 , the homogeneous solutions are highly oscillatory over the disk and the overlap will be very small unless a global resonance occurs .",
    "this happens when there is a homogeneous solution that ( nearly ) satisfies both radial boundary conditions .",
    "this means , in fact , that the frequency of a free bending mode of the disk ( in the inertial frame ) is ( nearly ) equal to @xmath3 .",
    "then the operator on the left - hand side of equation ( [ airy ] ) is ( nearly ) singular and a large response results .",
    "this clearly occurs during the inviscid resonances .",
    "when this happens , equation ( [ airy ] ) breaks down ; however , the analysis in section 6 is valid .    if , instead , @xmath263 , the response is also reasonably large because there is little or no cancellation in the overlap integral .",
    "this can explain the long tail of the primary resonance , where the net growth rate is found to be positive for sufficiently small , but non - zero , @xmath27 .    for the reference model , @xmath264 .",
    "as @xmath120 is reduced from @xmath121 to @xmath265 , we pass from the first case @xmath262 , through several resonances , towards the second case , @xmath266 . the interpretation given above",
    "can therefore explain the behavior found in section  6 .",
    "it is natural to ask whether the parameters of real disks are likely to allow a tilting instability in practice .",
    "we have tested how the the value of the outer radius at which the primary resonance occurs , @xmath267 , varies with all the parameters of the model .",
    "the variations with @xmath103 , @xmath98 , and @xmath202 are well approximated by @xmath268 , @xmath269 being given by equation ( [ lambda ] ) .",
    "the variations with @xmath119 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 are all less significant . comparing this estimate of @xmath270 with the tidal radius @xmath271 of a disk estimated by papaloizou & pringle ( 1977 )",
    ", we find that the inequality @xmath272 is satisfied for @xmath273 .",
    "we conclude that tidally truncated disks extend too far beyond the primary resonance for instability to occur , unless @xmath274 , which is not suggested by observations ( although it should be remembered that @xmath275 is the true semi - thickness of our polytropic model , and not an approximate scale - height ) .",
    "for tidally truncated disks , a tilting instability would occur only in the unlikely case that a higher - order resonance condition were met .",
    "it can also be seen from the above that to impose an ` ingoing wave ' boundary condition at the center of the disk , as was done by papaloizou & terquem ( 1995 ) , is questionable .",
    "those authors envisaged that the bending wave ( i.e. @xmath259 ) would be excited at the outer edge of the disk and would propagate inwards , growing in amplitude until nonlinear effects caused it to dissipate .",
    "the wave would then fail to reflect from the center of the disk .",
    "in contrast , we find that the wave may be considered to be launched at a local resonance located at the center of the disk . since the tidal forcing vanishes there , the wave is not significantly excited unless the width of the resonance ( proportional to @xmath269 ) becomes comparable to the radius of the disk . in this case",
    ", the wave is launched at all radii and global resonant effects must be taken into account .",
    "however , the wave amplitude does not diverge at the center of the disk ; equation ( [ airy ] ) has a solution with a finite tilt and vanishing torque at @xmath276 for the surface density profile adopted .",
    "nonlinear dissipation may not occur .",
    "indeed , perhaps contrary to conventional wisdom , the instability at the primary resonance ( where the disk edge is at radius @xmath277 ) operates in a completely inviscid disk with reflecting boundaries .",
    "the effects of the contribution of @xmath195 to the tilt growth can be related back to the mode - coupling description seen in fig .  1 .",
    "in particular , wave equation ( [ airy ] ) describes the generation of the wave @xmath195 through the driving term on the right - hand side of that equation .",
    "this term involves the interaction of the @xmath1 tidal potential , represented by @xmath278 , with the rigid tilt , @xmath238 .",
    "this interaction produces a wave , @xmath195 , of the form of an @xmath4 bending wave having frequency nearly equal to @xmath279 in the inertial frame .",
    "the interaction of the wave with the tidal field produces a stress that corresponds to the tilt growth - rate contribution @xmath280 in equation ( [ omega2 ] ) .",
    "therefore the instability mechanism described by lubow ( 1992 ) is always at work here , but with the differences that global resonant effects can be important , and that dissipation is not required .",
    "furthermore , our comparison with the damping rate induced by the @xmath0 potential indicates that the instability is suppressed for tidally truncated disks , except in the unlikely event of a high - order resonance .",
    "in this paper , we have considered the linear stability of a coplanar protostellar disk that surrounds a star in a circular - orbit binary system .",
    "we have determined whether a slight tilt introduced into the disk would grow or decay in time .",
    "the outcome depends on the size of the disk . for disks that are truncated by standard tidal torques , typically resulting in an outer disk radius of about @xmath121 times the binary separation , we find that the disk tilt generally decays in time .    for smaller disks ,",
    "tilt growth is possible . as seen in fig .  2",
    ", a disk undergoes a strong , ` primary ' resonance with the tidal field when its outer radius is a certain fraction of the binary separation .",
    "this characteristic radius , which we denote by @xmath270 , is approximately @xmath281 times the binary separation for the parameters we have considered ( see table  1 ) , but would be smaller still for thinner disks with @xmath282 .",
    "in such a resonance , the disk experiences a growing tilt and becomes significantly warped ( see fig .",
    "this resonance occurs when the frequency of the lowest - order global bending mode in the disk matches the tidal forcing frequency , which is here twice the binary orbital frequency .",
    "weaker resonances occur at a series of discrete resonances corresponding to radii greater than @xmath270 .",
    "there is also a near resonance that occurs close to the disk center . for disks smaller than radius @xmath270 ,",
    "this resonance causes a very slight tilt growth if @xmath27 is sufficiently small ( but non - zero ) , and any initial tilt would be retained .    for disks with radii larger than @xmath270 ,",
    "including disks truncated by standard tidal torques , the tilt will decay on approximately the viscous time - scale of the disk , or roughly @xmath283 binary orbits for @xmath221 ( see fig .",
    "5 ) . for disks with large tilts ,",
    "nonlinear effects may shorten the time - scale to reach small tilts , perhaps to the precessional time - scale of the disk , or about @xmath284 binary orbits ( bate et  al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the net outcome of growth or decay of the disk tilt is determined by the competition of two torques .",
    "as seen in the inertial frame , the tidal torque acting on a tilted disk may be decomposed into a steady component and an oscillatory component with twice the binary orbital frequency .",
    "the steady torque , resulting from the @xmath0 component of the tidal field , causes the disk to become aligned with the binary orbit in the presence of dissipation , while the oscillatory torque , resulting from the @xmath1 component of the tidal field , causes misalignment .",
    "the steady torque produces an intuitively simple result because it causes the disk to settle to a state of coplanarity , where it experiences a minimum tidal potential energy , as a result of dissipation .",
    "the effect of the oscillatory torque is somewhat counterintuitive , but can be understood in terms of a mode - coupling model ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "provided that @xmath27 is sufficiently small , the oscillatory torque slightly dominates for smaller disks because material in such disks is generally closer to the near resonance that occurs in the vicinity of the disk center ( see eq .",
    "[ [ resonance ] ] ) .",
    "a major issue is the origin of the tilt in observed protostellar disks . in the case of hk tau ,",
    "the disk surrounds the secondary star , but the two stars are similar in spectral type ( monin , mnard , & duchne 1998 ) .",
    "although there are considerable uncertainties in the system parameters , the disk could extend to its standard tidal truncation radius , as suggested by stapelfeldt et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) . in that case",
    ", the results of this paper imply that tidal effects may cause decay of the primordial tilt , but in any case would not cause tilt growth . on the other hand , the existence of the tilt means that the decay time - scale can not be much shorter than the binary age , estimated as @xmath285  yr .",
    "this places some constraints on both the theory and the binary parameters , although there are considerable uncertainties .",
    "for example , consider the case that the binary separation is close to its projected value of 340 au .",
    "for @xmath221 , the linear tilt decay time - scale ( based on figure 2 ) would be several times longer than the estimated system age .",
    "on the other hand , the nonlinear decay time - scale estimate of bate et al ( 2000 ) suggests a decay time - scale substantially shorter than the estimated age .",
    "the nonlinear time - scale estimate would be more compatible with a somewhat larger binary separation .",
    "the predicted shape of a tilted , tidally truncated disk with @xmath286 is not strongly warped ( see fig .",
    "7 ) , in accord with the observations ( stapelfeldt et  al . 1998 ; koresko 1998 ) . the lack of an observed warp can not be used as evidence against binarity . on the other hand , a slight",
    "warp does occur for thinner disks such as in fig .",
    "7 case b , which could be observed as a small asymmetry .",
    "note that the decay time - scale of proper bending modes of this disk ( based on table 3 ) is of order @xmath287  yr if @xmath221 , much shorter than the linear tilt decay time - scale .",
    "if the disk were tilted and warped in an arbitrary way as a result of its formation process , we would expect it to evolve rapidly to a tilted but essentially unwarped shape , then the tilt itself would decay on a longer time - scale .",
    "however , the nonlinear effects discussed by bate et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) are likely to speed up both stages considerably .",
    "similar considerations apply to a recent observational test of coplanarity among a sample of t tauri binaries by donar , jensen , & mathieu ( 2000 ) .",
    "the data show some evidence for approximate coplanarity on a statistical basis .",
    "it is possible that some tidal evolution of the tilt towards coplanarity may be have occurred , if the tilt decays as rapidly as a disk precessional time - scale .",
    "it is important to understand whether disk truncation could occur close to the resonant radius @xmath270 , so that the disk would be unstable to tilting . for disks with a substantial tilt , terquem ( 1998 )",
    "has shown that a disk of radius close to @xmath270 is sometimes subject to a strong resonant torque that is parallel to its spin axis .",
    "this resonant torque can exceed the viscous torque in the disk for sufficiently small values of @xmath27 , @xmath288 .",
    "if this torque could truncate an initially tilted disk at radius @xmath270 , the disk might become strongly warped ( as seen in fig .",
    "6 ) and tilted further .",
    "the disk radius would be less than half of the standard tidal truncation radius .",
    "however , it is unclear that this torque would lead to disk truncation at @xmath270 because it is smoothly distributed over the disk rather than being concentrated near @xmath270 .",
    "this is because the resonance is global rather than local .",
    "the lack of a strong warp in hk tau argues against this process in that system .",
    "disks in cataclysmic binaries are expected to be much colder than protostellar disks , having a smaller value of @xmath257 .",
    "consequently , such disks are even less likely to be unstable to tilting as a result of the @xmath1 component of the tidal field ( see eq .",
    "[ [ stab ] ] ) .    in several x - ray binaries ,",
    "most notably her x-1 , there is evidence for a tilted , precessing disk ( see wijers & pringle 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "the tilting mechanism we have described is very unlikely to operate in such disks , which are expected to be tidally truncated and to have @xmath289 . therefore , it appears that tidal torques are not responsible for the tilting of disks in x - ray binaries ( cf .",
    "larwood 1998 ) .",
    "possible mechanisms for tilting these disks include wind torques ( schandl & meyer 1994 ) and radiation torques ( wijers & pringle 1999 ) .",
    "another possible application of this work is to nearly keplerian disks that surround black holes in active galactic nuclei .",
    "if the disk is subject to a bar potential from the galaxy and the disk radius is sufficiently smaller than the corotation radius of the bar , then the disk will be subject to this tilt instability .",
    "the results in this paper have implications to protostellar disks perturbed by inclined planets .",
    "a secular resonance occurs where the precession frequency of a planet matches the local precession frequency of an orbiting particle .",
    "the resonant radius changes as the nebula disperses and the resonance sweeps across a major portion of the solar nebula ( ward 1981 ) . however , the current results suggest that the effects of such resonances on the gaseous nebula are mild and are distributed over the disk .",

    "<S> we find that disks that are sufficiently large , in particular those that extend to their tidal truncation radii , are generally stable and will therefore tend to alignment with the binary plane on a time - scale comparable to that found in previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> however , the effect of the @xmath1 component is enhanced in the vicinity of resonances where the outer radius of the disk is such that the natural frequency of a global bending mode of the disk is equal to twice the binary orbital frequency . under such circumstances , </S>",
    "<S> the disk can be unstable to tilting and acquire a warped shape , even in the absence of dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> the outer radius corresponding to the primary resonance is always smaller than the tidal truncation radius . for disks smaller than the primary resonance </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath1 component may be able to cause a very slow growth of inclination through the effect of a near resonance that occurs close to the disk center . </S>",
