    "<S> we describe a new kind of self - propelling motion of bacteria based on the cooperative action of rotating flagella on the surface of bacteria . describing the ensemble of rotating flagella in the framework of the hydrodynamics with spin </S>",
    "<S> the reciprocal theorem of stokesian hydrodynamics is generalized accordingly . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity of the self - propulsion is expressed in terms of the characteristics of the vector field of flagella orientation and it is shown that unusually high velocities of _ thiovulum majus _ bacteria may be explained by the cooperative action of the rotating flagella . the expressions obtained enable us to estimate the torque created by the rotary motors of the bacterium and show quantitative agreement with the existing experimental data .    </S>",
    "<S> systems where an important role is played by the rotation of constituent particles are well known . </S>",
    "<S> particular examples include liquid crystals @xcite , magnetic liquids @xcite and others . </S>",
    "<S> the concept of a viscous stress induced by particle rotations allows one to describe such phenomena as the increase of the effective viscosity of a magnetic fluid in an applied magnetic field @xcite , the rotation of magnetic liquid droplets in a rotating field @xcite , the macroscopic flows caused by internal rotations on the free boundaries of a liquid sample @xcite and negative effective viscosity of so - called quincke suspensions @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it was recently found that macroscopic flow may arise in bacterial suspensions due to the rotation of bacteria @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the bacteria _ thiovulum majus _ were shown to form rotating aggregates near solid walls which may be interpreted as rotating crystals @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that _ thiovulum majus _ bacteria are among the fastest microorganisms and their velocity of self - propelling motion may reach @xmath0 - an order of magnitude faster than , for example , the well - known bacteria _ e.coli _ @xcite . as noted in @xcite the physical mechanism behind the high self - propulsion velocity of _ thiovulum majus _ </S>",
    "<S> bacteria is not known at present .    here </S>",
    "<S> we show how the concept of stress induced by torques acting on flagella of a _ thiovulum majus _ bacterium enables us to explain this phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> we start by generalizing the reciprocal theorem of the stokesian hydrodynamics @xcite to the case of a fluid with antisymmetric viscous stresses .    </S>",
    "<S> the equation of motion for a liquid with antisymmetric viscous stresses reads @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the volume density of torques acting on the liquid . since _ thiovulum majus _ bacteria have a large quantity of short rotating flagella ( on the order of several hundred according to @xcite ) we take into account torques in a liquid layer of thickness @xmath5 that surrounds the bacterium . </S>",
    "<S> besides the flow and stress of the liquid with spin given by @xmath6 according to eq.([eq:1 ] ) we also consider the solution of the stokes equation for the flow around a sphere moving with velocity @xmath7 or rotating with an angular velocity @xmath8 @xmath9 the flow velocity and stress obtained by solving eq.([eq:2 ] ) are denoted @xmath10 . multiplying the equation of motion @xmath11 by @xmath12 , integrating by parts and using eqs.([eq:1],[eq:2 ] ) and the condition of incompressibility we obtain the following generalization of the reciprocal theorem in the case of the liquid with spin ( </S>",
    "<S> @xmath13 is the velocity of a sphere in the liquid described by eq.([eq:1 ] ) , @xmath14 is the normal to the surface of sphere , surface integrals are taken along the surface of sphere , the volume integral is taken along the region occupied by the surrounding liquid ) : @xmath15 where @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the case when @xmath17 correspond to the velocity and stress fields in the case of sphere moving with a constant velocity @xmath7 . according to the solution of the stokes problem @xmath18 and @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> since the self - propelling motion with velocity @xmath13 occurs at zero force @xmath20 then the generalized reciprocal theorem ( [ eq:3 ] ) yields @xmath21 it is therefore the distribution of torques in the liquid layer surrounding the sphere that causes the self - propelling motion . </S>",
    "<S> since the flagella of _ thiovulum majus _ are short we can approximate the relation ( [ eq:4 ] ) for the velocity of self - propulsion in the direction of the unit vector @xmath22 as follows ( @xmath23 ) ( @xmath24 is the area of the surface element of the sphere with the radius equal to one ) @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the torque created by a single flagellum and @xmath27 is the number of flagella per unit surface area of the bacterium . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath28 ( where @xmath29 denotes the number of flagella per bacterium ) the relation ( [ eq:5 ] ) may be rewritten as follows @xmath30 where we have introduced the notation @xmath31 we see that the self - propulsion velocity depends on the vector field @xmath32 , which may be expressed in terms of vector spherical harmonics @xcite @xmath33 ( where @xmath34 denotes the conventional spherical harmonics and the operator @xmath35 as follows @xmath36 expressing @xmath37 , using @xmath38 and the orthogonality of vector spherical harmonics @xmath39 we may express @xmath40 as @xmath41 which gives the azimuthal component of the vector field @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> thus for self - propulsion it is necessary that the vector field @xmath32 has azimuthal component which creates thrust as shown by the sketch in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] .        in some sense a similar thing happens for _ volvox _ algae cells , which flagella beats in a plane that is tilted approximately @xmath43 from the anterior - posterior axis causing their rotation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> angular dependence of the azimuthal component of @xmath44 which gives the contribution to the thrust is similar to the slip velocity dependence of the celebrated squirmer model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding calculation in the frame of the boundary layer approach confirms the result given by eq.([eq:6 ] ) .    the trajectory of a _ thiovulum majus _ </S>",
    "<S> bacterium is a helix @xcite which means that in addition to the self - propulsion the bacterium also rotates around the axis which makes an angle with the direction of the velocity . </S>",
    "<S> the reciprocal theorem ( [ eq:3 ] ) allows us to obtain the relation for the angular velocity of the bacterium rotation . </S>",
    "<S> taking @xmath45 on the surface of a sphere rotating with the angular velocity @xmath8 , when @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and applying the condition of zero torque relation ( [ eq:3 ] ) gives @xmath48 estimating the right side of eq.([eq:8 ] ) as previously for the angular velocity of bacterium rotation we have ( @xmath49 is the unit vector along the angular velocity ) @xmath50 where we have introduced the notation </S>",
    "<S> @xmath51 as a result we can obtain a simple relation between the angular velocity of the bacterium and its velocity of self - propulsion @xmath52 taking @xmath53 , @xmath54 @xcite for the angular velocity we can obtain an estimate for the velocity of self - propulsion @xmath55 - a value close to the experimental findings . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the rapid self - propulsion velocity of _ thiovulum majus _ may be explained by the cooperative action of the ensemble of rotating flagella distributed along the surface of the bacterium . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficients @xmath56 depend on the distribution of the flagella on the surface of bacterium about which , as far as we know , there is little information at the present time .    </S>",
    "<S> eq.([eq:6 ] ) allows us to estimate the torque created by the rotary motors of bacterium @xmath26 . taking @xmath57 and @xmath58 </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath59 - a value quite close to results obtained experimentally by different means and referenced in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this gives additional evidence that the unusually high velocity of self - propulsion of _ thiovulum majus _ </S>",
    "<S> bacteria is caused by the cooperative motion in the ensembles of rotating flagella distributed along the surfaces of bacteria .    in </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the formation of rotating crystals of _ thiovulum majus _ </S>",
    "<S> bacteria is described and data for the angular velocity of the crystal in dependence on its size are given . </S>",
    "<S> since the mechanism of this phenomenon is similar to the considered in the first part we will further describe it within the framework of the hydrodynamics with spin . </S>",
    "<S> bacteria stuck to a solid wall due to the flow caused by the presence of solid boundary form a dense aggregate of rotating bacteria @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the volumetric torque density in the liquid may be estimated according to the relation @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) , where @xmath62 is number of bacteria per unit volume @xmath63 is their radius and @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) is the angular velocity of their rotation . </S>",
    "<S> the stokes equation for the cylindrical layer of bacteria with radius @xmath66 and thickness @xmath67 surrounded by liquid with the same viscosity under the action of torques caused by bacteria reads @xmath68 where @xmath69 which should be solved in the half - space @xmath70 at the no - slip boundary condition @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> the torques induce the azimuthal force on the boundary of the aggregate @xmath72 , which causes a rotational flow in the direction of the bacterial rotation . in that sense </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of the aggregate is similar to the behavior of magnetic fluid droplet in a rotating magnetic field @xcite or the less trivial case of an ensemble of chiral particles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the solution of the problem is found by the 2d fourier transform @xmath73 and @xmath74 which after lengthy but straightforward calculations yields the following expression for the azimuthal velocity of the flow    @xmath75    for the period of the aggregate rotation @xmath76 this yields @xmath77    the multiplier @xmath78 is estimated as @xmath79 assuming a dense packing of bacteria in the layer .    . </S>",
    "<S> solid line calculated according to relation ( [ eq:16 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> circles experimental data from @xcite . ]    fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] shows the period @xmath80 as a function of the ratio @xmath81 in logarithmic coordinates to match the experimental data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the model of the liquid with spin predicts linear growth of the period of aggregate rotation with its size , which is in full agreement with the experimental data .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> we have described evidence that the approach of the hydrodynamics with spin is fruitful for bacterial hydrodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> it allows us to explain the unusually high velocities of self - propulsion of _ thiovulum majus _ bacteria and describe the flow arising in aggregates of rotating bacteria . </S>"
