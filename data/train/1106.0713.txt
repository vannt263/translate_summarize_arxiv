    "a special type of a multipartite entangled state , cluster state , represents a universal resource for the measurement - based quantum computing ( mbqc ) paradigm @xcite . in measurement - based quantum computing , quantum computations",
    "are carried out on the cluster state through individual qubit measurements in adaptive bases @xmath0 .",
    "the primary advantage of mbqc over other register - based architectures rests in the fact that all interactions , required _",
    "e.g. _ for two - qubit gates , are performed in the initialization stages of the resource state .",
    "the computation may then be performed through simultaneous measurement of many individual qubits as warranted by the specific program being implemented .",
    "any one- and two - qubit gate can be realized by appropriate measurements , making mbqc equivalent to the standard quantum circuit model @xcite .",
    "moreover , since the actual computation is done by local measurements , it can be faster compared to the equivalent gates in the circuit model .    the cluster state is realized by preparing individual qubits in an eigenstate @xmath1 of the pauli spin operator @xmath2 , and letting the nearest neighbor qubits interact via ( up to local operations ) an ising hamiltonian @xmath3 during a time @xmath4 so that @xmath5 .",
    "it clearly shows that the cluster state can be generated by applying a phase gate @xmath6 between all nearest neighbor qubits .",
    "a cluster state was experimentally realized with photons @xcite using linear optics , but this approach is difficult to scale to a large number of qubits .",
    "schemes to generate a cluster state using atom - cavity entanglement in the framework of cavity qed @xcite , cold ions via phonon - mediated spin - spin interactions @xcite , and distributed networks of collectively excited atomic ensembles @xcite have also been proposed .",
    "a naturally highly scalable system is neutral atoms in an optical lattice , where a 1d cluster state has been produced via ultracold s - wave collisions of atoms in a spin - dependent lattice @xcite .",
    "neutral atoms can also be entangled via long - range van der waals ( vdw ) or dipole - dipole interaction when excited to rydberg states .",
    "atoms in rydberg states can have huge dipole moments of several kilodebyes and interact strongly with each other @xcite , which was suggested as a tool to produce two - qubit gates in neutral - atom based quantum computing @xcite .",
    "recently , in a series of experiments @xcite rydberg ( dipole ) blockade between two atoms has been observed , followed by the demonstrations of a blockade - assisted cnot gate @xcite and entanglement between two atoms @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to explore the possibility to use the strong interaction in rydberg states to generate a cluster state .",
    "moreover , it would offer a way to produce a cluster state with polar molecules , coupled via dipole - dipole interaction , for which collision - based interactions can result in undesirable inelastic or chemical reaction losses . for simplicity",
    "we primarily discuss in this work neutral atoms interacting in rydberg states , the same scheme can be applied to molecules .",
    "we propose to realize a cluster state by applying a phase gate to all pairs of nearest neighbor atoms in an optical lattice .",
    "the phase gate can be realized using either direct or blockaded interaction in rydberg states .",
    "this can be accomplished in a scalable way , _",
    "i.e. _ in a finite number of operations , not depending on the number of atoms in the lattice .",
    "in fact , to make pair excitation controllable and to minimize errors due to interactions of multiple atoms in rydberg states , it already suffices to excite every other pair : ( a ) to produce a 1d cluster state , four iterations are required and would be implemented as follows : using a periodic entangler , such as a standing wave , entangle positions 1 with 2 , @xmath7 with @xmath8 , etc . ; in the second step , entangle positions 3 with 4 , @xmath9 with @xmath10 , etc . ; in the third step entangle positions 2 and 3 , @xmath11 and @xmath9 , etc ; in the last step entangle positions 4 and 5 , @xmath10 and @xmath7 etc .",
    "( b ) for 2d cluster state generation , first the rows in @xmath12-direction are entangled , then the entangling operations are applied to columns in y - direction . this can be done using optical standing wave excitation as is illustrated in fig.[fig : superlattices]a in the case of a 1d optical lattice .",
    "pairs of atoms at the maxima of the standing wave intensity will get entangled , while those at the minima will not .",
    "changing the phase of the standing wave fields , _",
    "i.e. _ shifting the position of the intensity maxima and minima , will allow to perform the phase gate between all nearest neighbors , producing a cluster state .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe how a 1d cluster state can be realized using interaction in rydberg states . in section",
    "iii we show how to generalize the technique used for the 1d cluster state generation to produce a universal 2d cluster state .",
    "finally , we discuss the main features of the scheme and conclude in section iv .",
    "we start by analyzing how a 1d cluster state can be generated by applying the phase gate between all neighboring atoms in a 1d optical lattice .",
    "we assume that initially atoms are loaded into the ground motional state of an optical lattice described by a potential @xmath13 , shown in fig.[fig : superlattices]a , which can be done using a superfluid - mott insulator transition .",
    "two ground state hyperfine sublevels @xmath14 encode qubit states @xmath15 , @xmath16 . as a final preliminary step atoms are transferred into the @xmath1 superposition by applying a @xmath17 pulse , resonant with the qubit transition .",
    "a phase gate between atoms in neighboring sites can be implemented using strong vdw or dipole - dipole interaction in rydberg states .",
    "there are two ways to perform the phase gate depending on whether atoms are individually addressable or not @xcite .",
    "standard rydberg blockade requires individual addressing of the atoms .",
    "individual addressing in an optical lattice has been demonstrated recently using a tightly focused laser beam and a spin - dependent lattice @xcite .",
    "however , sequential application of the phase gate to each pair of atoms is not scalable to a large number of qubits . in a good scalable approach",
    "the cluster state has to be generated in a finite number of operations which does not depend on the size of the system .",
    "below we analyze the possibility to generate the 1d cluster state assuming that atoms in each pair are not addressed individually .    if one uses a standing wave excitation pulse with the rabi frequency @xmath18 , one has the maxima at _",
    "e.g. _ even and minima at odd pairs sites ( see fig.[fig : superlattices]a ) .",
    "the atoms at the maxima are transferred from the qubit state @xmath16 to the rydberg state @xmath19 either directly or by a two - photon excitation , as shown in fig.[fig : superlattices]b , below we assume two - photon excitation .",
    "the phase gate is then realized in the limit @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is the interaction strength in the rydberg state @xmath22 ) as follows : 1 ) a @xmath23-pulse resonant to the @xmath24 transition is applied simultaneously to both atoms , exciting each to the @xmath19 state , since the shift of the doubly excited state @xmath22 is smaller than the rabi frequency ; 2 ) atoms in the @xmath22 state interact during time @xmath25 and accumulate a @xmath23 phase shift @xmath26 ; 3 ) a second @xmath23-pulse deexcites atoms back to their original qubit states .",
    "the standing wave therefore allows to control the rydberg excitation pattern , which would be more difficult if a spatially homogeneous excitation pulse is used .",
    "we also note that vdw and dipole - dipole interactions of rydberg atoms are long - range . as a result , when atoms are excited to @xmath19 , the interaction strength between atoms in neighboring pairs is comparable to the interaction strength between atoms within a pair , which will result in a phase error .",
    "the error is considerably reduced by exciting atoms only in every other pair using the standing wave .",
    "the interaction strength between atoms in closest excited even pairs is then smaller by a factor of @xmath27 for vdw and @xmath28 for dipole - dipole interaction than the interaction strength within a pair . here",
    "@xmath29 is the interaction strength between atoms in a pair and @xmath30 is the interaction strength between atoms in closest exited pairs .",
    "excitation to rydberg states of alkali atoms is typically a two - photon process via intermediate @xmath31 , @xmath32 states . using the level scheme shown in fig.[fig : level - scheme]a we can write the schrdinger equation for the amplitudes of the qubit states",
    ". if the qubit is initially in the @xmath33 state , the corresponding system of equations is    @xmath34    where @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the amplitudes of the states @xmath33 , @xmath38 and @xmath22 ( other states are far - detuned and not populated provided that @xmath39 ; @xmath40 is the detuning from the intermediate state , @xmath41 are the rabi frequencies of the excitation pulses ) . assuming @xmath42 and @xmath43 the solution of this system is given by @xmath44 which shows that for a pulse duration @xmath45 such that @xmath46 the state evolves into @xmath47 .",
    "next , the excitation pulses are switched off and the atoms interact in the doubly excited state for time @xmath25 so that @xmath26 , and the state flips sign @xmath48",
    ". finally , we apply the same @xmath23-pulse for time @xmath45 , bringing the system into a state @xmath49 .    if the initial state is @xmath50 the system evolution is governed by equations ( similar for the @xmath51 state )    @xmath52    which in the case @xmath53 gives the solution @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the hyperfine splitting of the atomic ground state .",
    "one can see that for @xmath56 the system returns to the state @xmath57 .    finally , if the system is initially in the @xmath58 state , the wavefunction evolves as @xmath59 bringing the system into @xmath60 for @xmath56 if @xmath53 . as a result",
    ", the phase gate @xmath61 is implemented .    to proceed with cluster state generation",
    "the phase gate has now to be performed with odd pairs of atoms , _",
    "i.e. _ atoms 3 and 4 , @xmath9 with @xmath10 , etc . for that",
    "the phase @xmath62 of the excitation pulse is shifted by @xmath17 to become @xmath63 . at this point",
    "all atoms in even and odd pairs become entangled . as a next step",

    "i.e. _ to atoms 2 and 3 , @xmath11 and @xmath9 , etc . and atoms 4 and 5 , @xmath10 and @xmath7 , etc . which can be done by setting @xmath64 and , finally , to @xmath65",
    "this will result in the phase gate applied to all nearest neighbors .    in fig.[fig",

    "a we calculate several types of intrinsic errors and find that the main errors of this type of phase gate are caused by the finite width of the ground motional state wavefunction of each atom in a lattice site .",
    "this results in a finite spread of the rabi frequency of the standing wave excitation pulse .",
    "other significant errors are due to the finite ratio of the interaction strength to the two - photon rabi frequency and the decay of population in rydberg states .",
    "the corresponding gate fidelity is @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the corresponding gate error , and averaging is over the motional ground state wavefunction . in the fidelity calculation",
    "equal rabi frequencies of the pulses @xmath42 were assumed and a decay of a rydberg state with the rate @xmath82 was introduced .    in order to find the error due to the finite width of the ground state motional wavefunction we approximate the potential at each site as harmonic with the oscillation frequency @xmath83 and the corresponding wavefunction width @xmath84 for @xmath85 , which we use for an estimate .",
    "here @xmath86 is the atomic recoil energy , @xmath87 is the atomic mass .",
    "we assume the rabi frequencies of the excitation pulses @xmath88 , where @xmath12 varies around potential minima of the n@xmath89 even pair of sites @xmath90 with the gaussian probability distribution @xmath91 .",
    "the contribution of the first error term is @xmath92 choosing @xmath93 mhz and @xmath94 mhz , the second , third and fourth error terms are @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 for the rydberg state lifetime @xmath98 @xmath99s , _ i.e. _ the total error is of the order of @xmath100 .",
    "the high value of the two - photon rabi frequency @xmath94 mhz can be achieved using a two - photon excitation path @xmath101 with @xmath102 and @xmath103 nm lasers , respectively , due to the larger dipole moment of the @xmath104 transition @xcite , allowing to reach a high rabi frequency @xmath105 . at the same time the decay time of the @xmath106 state ( 125 ns )",
    "allows to minimize the error due to the decay of the intermediate state .",
    "the probability of the decay during the gate is @xmath107 .",
    "choosing @xmath108 ghz the probability of the intermediate state decay is @xmath109 .",
    "there is also an error due to the undesirable interaction of atoms belonging to different excited pairs , @xmath110 ( see appendix a , section a ) . assuming that interacting atoms belong to the closest excited pairs , we have @xmath111 for vdw and @xmath28 for dipole - dipole interaction . as a result , the error is @xmath112 for vdw and @xmath113 for dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "this analysis assumes that the excitation from @xmath16 to @xmath19 and back is adiabatic with respect to the lattice motional frequency and there is no uncertainty in the interaction strength , analyzed in appendix a , section c. if the excitation - deexcitation is non - adiabatic , there is an additional gate error due to the uncertainty in the interaction strength @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the distance between nearest neighbors in the lattice .",
    "this error was derived assuming @xmath116 , which is not the case in our estimates . if @xmath117 the error will be higher , and we use the first term @xmath118 as a lower bound for this type of error .",
    "the error derivation assumes that the trapping potential for the ground and rydberg state is the same , providing the same motional frequency .",
    "this can be achieved in a blue - detuned optical lattice at a `` magic '' wavelength , at which ground and rydberg state polarizabilities are equal @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the error can be avoided if the trapping lattice is switched off when atoms are excited to rydberg states and the gate pulses are much shorter than the motional period . in this",
    "case atoms move only a small fraction of the ground motional state width during the gate and will be recaptuted in the ground motional state once the trapping lattice is switched back on .",
    "finally , there is a finite probability to excite atoms in `` inactive '' lattice sites , sitting in minima of the standing wave excitation pulse .",
    "the probability that the pair of atoms stays in the initial state after the gate , averaged over four possible initial states , is calculated in appendix a , section e. for a two - photon excitation the averaged probability @xmath119 .",
    "the error analysis shows that first , vdw interaction results in smaller errors caused by the interaction of atoms in different excited pairs compared to the dipole - dipole one .",
    "second , the excitation to rydberg states has to be adiabatic to avoid errors due to the uncertainty of the interaction strength . on the other hand",
    ", these errors could be avoided altogether if excitation to the @xmath22 state is not required .",
    "next we therefore analyze the phase gate based on rydberg ( dipole ) blockade , where only one atom is excited to a rydberg state , provided individual addressing of atoms in a pair is possible .",
    "if individual addressing of atoms in a pair is possible , one can use standard dipole blockade @xcite , and the phase gate is realized in the limit @xmath120 as follows : 1 ) a control atom is excited from one of the qubit states , _ e.g. _ a qubit state @xmath16 to a rydberg state @xmath19 by a @xmath23-pulse ; 2 ) a @xmath121-pulse of the same frequency is applied to a target atom .",
    "dipole - dipole or vdw interaction shifts the energy of the doubly excited state @xmath22 , as a result the @xmath121-pulse has no effect on the target atom ( the excitation is blockaded ) since the rabi frequency of the pulse is much smaller than the energy shift ; 3 ) the control atom is deexcited back to its original qubit state .",
    "we stress that we do not require individual addressing of atoms in the lattice , we only need atoms in each pair to be separately addressable , this is why we call it `` individual '' addressing .",
    "individual addressing in a pair can be realized using a polarization gradient optical lattice @xcite , where not only the intensity of the lattice field but also its polarization changes periodically in space .",
    "a lattice of double - wells was demonstrated in @xcite with the polarization being linear in one site and elliptical in the neighboring site of each well .",
    "the elliptical polarization results in a non - zero contribution from a vector part of polarizability , producing a state - dependent shift @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the vector part of the polarizability , @xmath124 is the atomic angular momentum , and @xmath125 is the positive frequency part of the total electric field @xmath126 .",
    "the contribution from the vector part can , therefore , be viewed as a fictitious magnetic field @xmath127 .",
    "atoms can be loaded into a double - well optical lattice , formed by two standing wave fields of different polarizations .",
    "let us consider the lattice field @xmath128 this lattice can be produced by two pairs of laser beams , intersecting at @xmath23 and @xmath129 angles @xcite .",

    "the scalar part of the potential is typically larger than the vector part , since the vector polarizability is about an order of magnitude smaller than the scalar part for alkalis .",

    "we can encode a qubit into the states @xmath146 , @xmath147 , this qubit transition is insensitive to magnetic field fluctuations at a bias magnetic field @xmath148 g @xcite . as a result ,",
    "if a magnetic field is applied , the @xmath15 and @xmath16 states will shift by the same amount preserving the qubit frequency .",
    "the @xmath149 term , acting as a fictitious magnetic field , will then shift states @xmath15 , @xmath16 in the right site with respect to the qubit states in the left site of the well @xcite ( see fig.[fig : double - well]b ) , allowing to selectively excite only one atom in each pair , while having another atom unaffected by the excitation pulse . for @xmath66rb @xmath150 khz at the lattice wavelength @xmath151 nm , and the shifts for the @xmath15 ,",
    "@xmath16 states are @xmath152 khz .",
    "larger shifts of the order of @xmath153 khz @xcite can be realized with optimized parameters of the lattice .",
    "if the two - photon excitation rabi frequency is much smaller than the vector shift @xmath154 , the atoms in the left and right sites can be excited to the @xmath19 state selectively .",
    "the phase gate then can be realized using dipole blockade as : 1 ) a @xmath23-pulse resonant to the @xmath24 transition of a control atom is applied , exciting it to the @xmath19 state ; a target atom is off - resonant by @xmath155 , which is the relative shift of the qubit state @xmath16 in left and right site , and is not excited ; 2 ) a @xmath121-pulse resonant to the @xmath24 transition of the target atom is applied .",

    "the @xmath208-lattice period is assumed sufficiently large so that atoms in neighboring @xmath12-chains do not interact when excited to rydberg states . in this way , following the steps of sections ii a or ii b , we can produce a series of 1d cluster states in the @xmath12 direction . as a next step we adiabatically reduce @xmath209 to get a regular lattice in the @xmath12-direction with a period @xmath210 ( in the case of a double - well lattice ) , followed by stretching of the @xmath12-lattice .",
    "next , the @xmath208-lattice period is reduced to bring the @xmath12-chains closer and the regular or double - well lattice @xmath211 is switched on in the @xmath208 direction .",
    "next , the entanglement operations of sections ii a or ii b can be repeated for 1d chains in the @xmath208 direction , producing a 2d cluster state .",
    "let us estimate the time required to generate the 2d state . as we showed in the end of section ii c a 1d cluster state in the @xmath12-direction",

    "adiabatic reduction of @xmath172 will take @xmath214 @xmath99s , as can be seen from fig.[fig : superlatt - manip](e ) in the right panel .",
    "next , we need to estimate the time required to stretch the @xmath12-lattice .",
    "the stretch has to be adiabatic for atoms to remain in the ground motional state of the lattice .",
    "we modeled the stretch of the lattice @xmath215 so that the @xmath216 vector was adiabatically changed from @xmath217 to @xmath218 .",
    "the period of the lattice @xmath219 at the end of the stretch is comparable to the distance @xmath220 between atoms which belong to every other excited pair in the double - well . as a result ,",
    "the error due to the interaction of atoms in neighboring @xmath12-chains is smaller than the error due to the interaction of atoms in neighboring excited pairs in the same chain .",
    "we modeled the evolution of the system by calculating the bloch bands and bloch functions , and used the latter to construct single - site wannier functions of the lattice @xmath174 during the stretch .",
    "we again took into account four lowest bloch bands , assumed that initially the population was in the ground bloch band , and monitored the excitation to higher - energy bands .",
    "we found that the stretch can be performed rather fast in @xmath221 @xmath99s , where @xmath150 khz for @xmath66rb , while retaining @xmath222 of the population in the ground bloch band .",
    "the populations of the lowest four bands during the lattice stretch are shown in fig.[fig : latt - stretch ] .",
    "finally , we can estimate the total time required to generate the 2d cluster state in the blockaded case .",
    "the time required for 1d state generation @xmath205 @xmath99s ; ramping down the @xmath172 lattice takes @xmath214 @xmath99s and the lattice stretch in the @xmath12-direction takes @xmath223 @xmath99s ; the total time is @xmath224 ms .",
    "next , the lattice period in the @xmath208-direction has to be adiabatically reduced , which will similarly take @xmath223 @xmath99s , followed by ramping up the @xmath225 lattice in @xmath214 @xmath99s , and a sequence of phase gate operations applied to the @xmath208-chains , will take @xmath205 @xmath99s .",
    "therefore , the total time of the 2d cluster state generation in the blockaded case is @xmath226 ms . the time required for 2d cluster state generation in the no - blockade case can be found summing the time required to produce 1d states in @xmath12-direction , @xmath203 @xmath99s , the time required to stretch the lattice in @xmath12-direction and shrink it in @xmath208 direction @xmath227 @xmath99s=@xmath228 ms , followed by application of the phase gate sequence in @xmath208-direction , requiring time @xmath203 @xmath99s .",
    "the total time needed to produce a 2d cluster state is therefore @xmath229 ms .",

    "namely , the error term @xmath238 ( here one - photon excitation is assumed ) can be reduced by increasing @xmath237 .",
    "one possible way to increase @xmath155 is to use hyperfine states @xmath14 with large @xmath239 for qubit encoding , since @xmath240 .",

    "the error due to rabi frequency variation @xmath251 is harder to reduce , since it pretty much depends only on the ratio @xmath252 , which can not be increased much beyond @xmath253 in order to have motional states localized in left and right sites of a double - well . using a very deep optical lattice with @xmath254 and @xmath255 , which still results in motional states localized in left and right wells , allows to reduce the error to @xmath256 .",
    "the transition between @xmath241 and @xmath242 states of cs is sensitive to magnetic field at all field values , meaning that the qubit will experience decoherence in these states . to reduce its effect one can keep the qubit in field insensitive @xmath257 and @xmath258 states during storage and lattice manipulation time and transfer it to the @xmath241 , @xmath242 only when the phase gate is applied",
    "this will result in an additional phase gate error due to magnetic field fluctuations @xmath259 , where @xmath260 is the fluctuation of the qubit transition frequency due to the fluctuating magnetic field @xmath261 and @xmath262 is the electron s gyromagnetic ratio . in a recent study @xcite suppression of magnetic field fluctuations down to @xmath263 @xmath99 g was demonstrated , resulting in @xmath264 s@xmath265 .",
    "one phase gate operation requires @xmath266 @xmath99s in our setup , resulting in the dephasing error per gate @xmath267 . as a result",
    ", the total gate error in the blockaded case can be reduced to @xmath268 .",
    "at the same time there are errors due to the excitation of atoms in `` inactive '' latice sites , situated at the minima of the standing wave .",

    "we can conclude from this analysis that in no - blockade case the multi - photon excitation , _",

    "the errors are due to leakage out of the computational subspace .",

    "the optimal error combination in the no - blockade case requires a four - photon excitation , while in the blockaded case one - photon excitation gives the optimal error combination .",
    "generation of a 1d cluster state in the no - blockade case requires almost an order of magnitude less time ( 80 @xmath99s ) compared to the blockaded case ( 700 @xmath99s ) due to the lattice change involved in the latter case .",
    "the times required to produce a 2d cluster state are , however , comparable : 1.62 ms without and 3.4 ms with dipole blockade . from the overall experimental complexity ( deep double - well lattice , lattice manipulation required ) the blockaded scheme seems more difficult to realize .    the same scheme can be applied to generate the cluster state with polar molecules .",
    "for example , molecular states with small dipole moments can be used to encode a qubit while for the phase gate molecules can be excited to a state with a large dipole moment , such that in this state molecules can interact via dipole - dipole interaction .",
