    "we should notice here that the effect of @xmath105 is just to split one peak into several small peaks corresponding to the plural nuclear excitations with the same quantum numbers .",
    "thus , the energy integrated total cross section is hardly changed by the @xmath105 factor .",
    "we conclude that the origins of the difference of the absolute value of the cross sections on the @xmath3sn and @xmath113sn targets are the factor two difference of the effective numbers @xmath146 of the @xmath21 neutron pick - up process , and the values of the @xmath110 and @xmath105 factors which reflect the occupation probability of the neutron states in the target and the relative strength of the excited levels of the daughter nucleus . here",
    ", we should be careful on the differences of the effects of @xmath110 and @xmath105 .",
    "the effect of @xmath110 makes the height of the peak lower and also makes the energy integrated total cross section smaller , whereas @xmath105 only divides the peak into small peaks and spreads in the energy spectrum .",
    "hence , the value of the energy integrated total cross section changes little even if the @xmath105 factor is taken into account ."
