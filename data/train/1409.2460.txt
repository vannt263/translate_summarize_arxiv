    "non - equilibrium dynamics of growing interfaces has attracted much interest in several scientific branches such as physics , chemistry , biology and engineering @xcite .",
    "a simple and widespread approach to the modeling of evolving surfaces considers particles in a random flux that irreversibly aggregate to the substrate following a given rule . considering ballistic trajectories for particles that aggregate at a first contact with the deposit we have the celebrated ballistic deposition ( bd ) model  @xcite , formerly proposed to simulate rock sedimentation , with applications to the modeling of thin film growth at low temperatures  @xcite and to describe colloidal particle deposition at the edges of evaporating drops  @xcite .",
    "a central characteristic of ballistic growth models is the lateral growth that produces a velocity excess .",
    "other models exhibiting this property include the eden model  @xcite , a paradigm in the study of curved surfaces , and models where large grains are randomly deposited  @xcite .",
    "the velocity excess is a hallmark of the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) universality class  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the hydrodynamic limit , one expects that the growth dynamics of ballistic models is described by the kpz equation @xcite @xmath2 where terms in the right side accounts , respectively , for the surface tension , local growth in the normal direction and a delta - correlated noise , with @xmath3 and @xmath4 , associated to the randomness of the deposition process . in @xmath5 dimensions ,",
    "the surface height in kpz systems asymptotically evolves according to the ansatz  @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the asymptotic growth velocity , @xmath8 is the signal of @xmath9 in the kpz equation [ eq .  ( [ eqkpz ] ) ] , @xmath10 is a non - universal constant associated to the amplitude of the interface fluctuations , @xmath11 is the growth exponent , and @xmath12 is a stochastic quantity given by tracy - widom  @xcite distributions .",
    "this conjecture was confirmed in distinct kpz systems  @xcite besides exact solutions of kpz equation  @xcite .",
    "recent numerical simulations have shown that the kpz ansatz can be generalized to 2 + 1  @xcite and higher @xcite dimensions , but the exact forms of the asymptotic distributions of @xmath12 are yet not known .    although the kpz equation was initially proposed to explain ballistic deposition models , numerical simulations commonly fail to provide a reliable connection between them and the kpz class , mainly in higher dimensions .",
    "for example , the interface width @xmath13 ( here @xmath14 represents the @xmath15th cumulant of @xmath16 ) scaling with time @xmath17 in the growth regime ( @xmath18 for @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the dynamic exponent  @xcite ) and with the system size @xmath21 in the steady state ( @xmath22 for @xmath23 ) leads to growth ( @xmath11 ) and roughness ( @xmath24 ) exponents smaller than the kpz values @xcite .",
    "in particular , for the bd model in @xmath5 , exponents in agreement with the kpz ones were obtained through appropriated extrapolations of effective exponents @xcite and , more recently , from extremely large - scale simulations accessing the regimes where corrections become negligible  @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent studies of height distributions have given additional proofs of the kpz universality of eden and bd models in @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "for eden models , scaling exponents and height distributions consistent with kpz class were also found in @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "however , for the bd model and also for a grain deposition ( gd ) model  @xcite in @xmath25 dimensions , strong corrections to the scaling were found  @xcite and evidences of the kpz class was limited to the collapse of interface width distributions  @xcite in the steady state .",
    "a correction in the squared interface width @xmath26 for the eden model  @xcite was proposed long ago as a constant additive term in the family - vicsek  @xcite ansatz , so that @xcite @xmath27 where the first term at the right side accounts for long wavelength fluctuations and @xmath28 is called intrinsic width .",
    "corrections consistent with an intrinsic width have been observed in many ballistic models  @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic width was initially attributed to large steps at surface  @xcite , but it was shown that large local height gradients is not a sufficient condition for intrinsic width since other kpz models presenting local height differences comparable to those of eden and ballistic deposition do not present a relevant intrinsic width  @xcite .",
    "finite - time corrections observed in several kpz systems lead to the modified ansatz  @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is , in principle , a model - dependent stochastic quantity responsible by a shift in the mean of the scaled variable @xmath31 in relation to the @xmath12 distributions , which vanishes as @xmath32 .",
    "corrections in higher order cumulants of @xmath33 and , consequently , of @xmath34 were also observed but without universal schema  @xcite .    in the present work , we perform a detailed study of bd and gd models on two - dimensional substrates and show that the intrinsic width @xmath28 can be suited in terms of the finite - time corrections of the kpz ansatz , eq .",
    "( [ eqansatzcorr ] ) , and the leading contribution to @xmath28 is due to a stochastic component of the local columnar growth intrinsic to ballistic growth .",
    "more precisely , we show that @xmath35 is very close to the variance of the local height increments during the deposition process . including this variance in the scaling analysis ,",
    "exponents in striking agreement with the kpz ones are found .",
    "since large variances in height increments are due to narrow - deep valleys in the surface , we also propose a method where the surface is constructed considering only the maximal heights inside bins of size @xmath0 and show that the intrinsic width is strongly reduced , leading to scaling exponents and height distributions in excellent agreement with the kpz class .",
    "our results providing a thorough confirmation of the kpz universality of the ballistic deposition in @xmath25 demystify a longstanding question which has been chased for decades .",

    "the distribution for the standard surface exhibits strong deviations in the left tail associated to fluctuations below the mean height ( since @xmath54 ) , where deep valleys contributions are present .",
    "the rescaled distributions for binned surfaces are very close to the rsos one .",
    "therefore , we show that ballistic growth models in @xmath25 dimensions obey the kpz ansatz with the expected universal stochastic term @xmath12 , which would be practically impossible with the currently computer resources if the strong finite - time corrections were not explicitly taken into account in the analysis .",
    "in summary , we have showed that the leading corrections to the scaling of ballistic growth models in @xmath25 arise from the large stochastic fluctuations of the height increments @xmath55 during the deposition process , which is expressed in the form of an intrinsic width @xmath28 in the family - vicsek scaling , eq .",
    "( [ eqfvg ] ) .",
    "we observed that @xmath56 .",
    "this intrinsic width also exists in solid - on - solid kpz models , but in this case @xmath57 , so that corrections to scaling are negligible . anyway , since the variance @xmath58 can be easily computed in numerical simulations , we propose that it should be calculated together with the squared interface width @xmath26 and the standard analysis of @xmath26 against time @xmath17 or substrate size @xmath21 , used in hundreds of previous works , should be replaced by @xmath59 _",
    "vs_. @xmath17 or @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "this procedure is able to eliminate the intrinsic width from the scaling analysis and to access the universal scaling exponents with affordable computer resources .",
    "we believe that this recipe must be a standard in numerical studies of growing interfaces , helping to uncover the universality of models where strong corrections play an important role .",
    "the large fluctuations in the height increments @xmath55 arises mainly from the aggregation at narrow - deep valleys in the surface .",
    "therefore , we also propose a simple method that eliminates these valleys at the surface , where the leading contributions to these fluctuations take place .",
    "basically , the original surface is binned in boxes of lateral size @xmath0 and only the highest point inside each box is used to construct a coarse - grained surface and to perform statistics .",
    "we showed that , for @xmath0 larger than the typical particle / grain size , the intrinsic width is strongly reduced .",
    "both methods yield scaling exponents for ballistic growth models in excellent agreement with the kpz class in @xmath25 . despite of ballistic growth models present the requisites for kpz class , to our knowledge",
    ", we provide the first convincing observation of kpz scaling exponents in these models in two - dimensions .",
    "moreover , the power of the binning method is not restricted to scaling exponents .",
    "indeed , the effects of finite - time corrections in the kpz ansatz become negligible if surfaces are built with @xmath60 , while the fundamental non - universal parameters [ growth velocity @xmath7 and amplitude of fluctuations @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ eqansatz ] ) ] as well the universal quantities [ growth exponent @xmath11 and @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ eqansatz ] ) ] remain unchanged .",
    "so , we showed that the rescaled height distributions for the growth regime of ballistic growth models are the same as those obtained for other kpz models in @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , the skewness of height distributions in the steady state also shows a good agreement with the value accepted for the kpz class in this dimension .",
    "therefore , we show that the ballistic growth models in @xmath25 belongs to the kpz universality class . in particular , our result ends a longstanding discussion about the validity of the kpz class in the classic bd model  @xcite .",
    "the binning method can , in principle , be easily applied in the analysis of experimental surfaces . as an example , consider the recent experiment by yunker _",
    "et al_. @xcite , where particles from a colloidal suspension were deposited at the edges of evaporating drops . for small anisotropy of the particles , the system was observed to be in the kpz class . on the other hand , for highly anisotropic particles , exponents different from the kpz class were found and attributed to the quenched kpz class .",
    "however , this conclusion have been questioned  @xcite . in ref .  @xcite a transient anomalous scaling was proposed as a possible explanation for the deviation from the kpz regime while in ref .",
    "@xcite an advection - diffusion model with strong corrections to the scaling due to a large intrinsic width was used to explain the deviation .",
    "in particular , we applied the binning method to advection - diffusion model of ref .",
    "@xcite and observed excellent agreement with kpz exponents ( data not shown ) .",
    "depending on the parameters , both model and experimental surfaces present a large number of narrow - deep valleys .",
    "thus , we believe that our binning method can be very useful to solve controversial issues as the colloidal deposition problem and others related systems ."
