    "nonlocality is a key feature of quantum mechanics . by performing measurements on separated systems in an entangled state",
    ", one can obtain correlations that are stronger than those of any local model , as witnessed by the violation of bell inequalities @xcite . on the other hand , sets of nonlocal correlations",
    "are known that are stronger than those of quantum mechanics , but which do not allow for instantaneous signalling . this led popescu and rohrlich @xcite to raise the question of why nonlocality seems to be limited in nature .    in recent years",
    ", new insights have been gained into this question by studying the information theoretic properties of super - quantum correlations .",
    "for instance these correlations lead to implausible reductions for all communication complexity problems , such that they can be solved with only constant communication @xcite .",
    "the principle of _ information causality _",
    "@xcite is satisfied by quantum correlations , but can be violated if certain super - quantum correlations are available  similarly the principle of _ macroscopic locality _ @xcite .",
    "various multi - player games have been described , for which super - quantum correlations would provide an advantage over quantum correlations @xcite .",
    "the above studies focused on the information theoretic power of correlations without any reference to the physical theories they emerge from .",
    "recent works revealed interesting connections between the structure of quantum mechanics and the nonlocal correlations that can be generated by quantum systems .",
    "barnum et al .",
    "@xcite , for example , considered a theory that is locally equivalent to quantum mechanics but whose non - locality is only limited by the no - signalling principle . despite this theory being less restrictive than quantum mechanics , the set of bipartite correlations that can be obtained is identical to that of quantum states .",
    "this implies that , despite the fact that quantum correlations are clearly a global property of joint systems , their limitation does not result from the lack of joint states , but rather from the structure of the local state spaces .",
    "meanwhile , acn et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that this result does not extend to three or more parties .    in this paper , we show that the connection between local state spaces and the limitation of bipartite nonlocal correlations is actually a more general phenomenon . in particular , if local state spaces have a property known as _ strong self - duality _ , then the correlations obtainable from maximally entangled states must be compatible with the principle of macroscopic locality .",
    "it follows that they must also respect tsirelson s bound .",
    "a precise definition of strong self - duality is given later , but in the quantum case it corresponds roughly to the fact that the same rank one projector represents both a pure state and the outcome of a measurement which identifies that state .    by way of illustration",
    ", we introduce along the way a family of models , where each model is defined by the local state space for a single system , and the state space is taken to be a regular polygon with @xmath0 vertices ( see ) .",
    "for two such systems , there is a natural analogue of a maximally entangled state .",
    "the family includes the classical case of two trits ( @xmath1 ) ; systems generating the super - quantum correlations introduced by popescu and rohrlich ( @xmath2 ) ; and systems producing quantum correlations ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "thus the family allows us to study the transition between these theories , and the bipartite correlations that can be produced by a maximally entangled state , by modifying only the local state space . for high",
    "@xmath0 the local state spaces are almost indistinguishable from a quantum system .",
    "nevertheless it turns out that these models show dramatically different correlations  and thereby have fundamentally different information theoretic capabilities  depending on the parity of @xmath0 .",
    "this is explained by the fact that those with odd @xmath0 are _ strongly self - dual _ , while those with even @xmath0 only _ weakly self - dual_.    one way of viewing the polygon models is that moving from @xmath4 to @xmath1 , there is a progressive weakening of the superposition principle .",
    "a weakened superposition principle means that states can only be superposed in certain combinations . in a similar spirit",
    ", a different range of models was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , with each model defined by a relaxation of the uncertainty relations of quantum mechanics . here",
    "too , a transition from quantum correlations to popescu - rohrlich correlations was observed .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ operationalmodels ] gives a brief , not too technical , introduction to a mathematical formalism in which a very broad range of probabilistic theories can be expressed , including quantum theory and classical probability theory .",
    "section [ sec : afamilyofmodels ] introduces the polygon models , and by investigating the properties of bipartite correlations , sheds some light on the relation between these and the local state space structure .",
    "section [ sec : selfdualityandtsirelsonsbound ] returns to the general case and contains the proof of the main theorem , which establishes a rigorous limit on the nonlocal correlations obtainable from a broad class of bipartite states in general probabilistic theories .",
    "in particular , states obtainable by norm - preserving local transformations from what we call _ inner product states _ can not violate the principle of macroscopic locality .",
    "section [ polygonsrevisited ] provides a formal definition of strong and weak self - duality , and discusses consequences of the main theorem for the correlations in bipartite polygon systems .",
    "section [ sec : correlationsoutsideofq1 ] presents a strongly self - dual system in which a non - maximally entangled state gives rise to correlations that can not be obtained from any inner product state .",
    "finally , section [ discussion ] discusses some open questions .",
    "this section describes briefly the framework of generalized probabilistic theories @xcite , using the notation and conventions of ref .",
    "the aim is to be able to describe theoretical models other than the classical and quantum theories , and for these two to be included as special cases .",
    "we start by taking an operational point of view .",
    "a _ state _ of a system is a mathematical object that defines the outcome probabilities for all the measurements that can possibly be performed on this system .",
    "the _ state space _ @xmath5 of a system is the set of states that it can be prepared in .    by defining the operations of summation and multiplication by a real number on states",
    ", we can identify @xmath6 as the probabilistic mixture obtained by preparing @xmath7 with probability @xmath8 and @xmath9 with probability @xmath10 .",
    "the state space @xmath5 is now a convex set , embedded in a real vector space @xmath11 . for simplicity , assume that @xmath5 is compact and finite dimensional .",
    "states that can be represented by convex combinations of other states are _ mixed _ states .",
    "the extremal points of the state space @xmath5 can not be written in such a form , and are _ pure _ states . for a quantum system , for example ,",
    "@xmath5 is the set of density operators on a hilbert space , and the pure states are the rank one projectors . for a qubit",
    ", @xmath5 is particularly easy to visualize , since it corresponds to the bloch ball , with pure states on the surface of the ball . for a ( finite - dimensional ) classical system , @xmath5 is the set of probability distributions over some finite sample space .",
    "a measurement outcome is represented by an _ effect _ , that is a map @xmath12 $ ] , where @xmath13 is the probability of obtaining the outcome @xmath14 when the measurement is performed on a system in the state @xmath15 .",
    "probabilities of measurement outcomes should respect probabilistic mixtures of states , meaning that @xmath16 = p\\ , e(\\omega_1 ) + ( 1-p)\\ , e(\\omega_2)$ ] , i.e. , the effects are affine maps .",
    "a special effect is the _ unit effect _ @xmath17 , which is uniquely defined such that @xmath18 for all @xmath19 .",
    "the unit effect represents a measurement with a single outcome that is certain to occur regardless of what the state is .",
    "an arbitrary measurement is a set of effects @xmath20 summing to the unit effect @xmath21 .",
    "this ensures that outcome probabilities of measurements sum to one .",
    "the set of proper effects @xmath22 is the convex hull of the unit effect , the zero effect and a set of extremal effects .",
    "for a quantum system , if states are density operators on a hilbert space , then effects can be identified with positive semidefinite operators on the hilbert space , in such a way that outcome probabilities are given by the usual trace rule .",
    "measurements correspond to positive operator - valued measures . for a classical system ,",
    "effects can be identified with fuzzy indicator functions on the sample space , i.e. , maps from the sample space into @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "it is frequently useful to work with unnormalized states . given a state space @xmath5 and effect space @xmath24 , let @xmath11 be the linear span of @xmath5 .",
    "the linear span of @xmath24 is then the dual space @xmath25 .",
    "both @xmath11 and @xmath25 are real vector spaces . in the case of a quantum system , for example",
    ", @xmath11 is the linear span of the density operators , which is the set of all hermitian operators on the corresponding hilbert space .",
    "similarly , @xmath25 is the linear span of the positive semidefinite operators , which is also the set of all hermitian operators .",
    "an unnormalized state is an element of @xmath11 of the form @xmath26 , with @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the set of all unnormalized states is a cone denoted @xmath29 .",
    "similarly , an unnormalized effect is an element of @xmath25 of the form @xmath30 for @xmath27 and @xmath31 .",
    "the set of unnormalized effects is the _ dual cone _ to @xmath29 , denoted @xmath32 .",
    "the cone @xmath29 and the dual cone @xmath32 are related via @xmath33 in the case of a quantum system , both @xmath29 and @xmath32 can be identified with the set of positive semidefinite operators on the hilbert space . in general",
    "a cone @xmath29 can have a very different structure than its dual cone @xmath32 , e.g. , they may have a different number of extremal rays .      given two systems @xmath34 and @xmath35 , an operational model needs to specify the set @xmath36 of available joint states , in addition to the individual state spaces @xmath37 and @xmath38 . in general",
    ", one can imagine many weird and wonderful ways in which two systems might combine to form a joint system .",
    "by imposing two quite natural conditions , however , one can narrow down these possibilities significantly .",
    "the first condition is the _ no - signalling principle _ , which says that it should not be possible to send messages instantaneously by performing measurements on the separate parts of a joint system .",
    "the second is that of _ local tomography_. given a single system , call a measurement _",
    "informationally complete _ if its outcome probabilities are sufficient to determine uniquely the state of the system .",
    "the principle of local tomography states that if an informationally complete measurement is performed separately on each of the subsystems of a composite system , then the joint outcome probabilities are sufficient to determine uniquely the state of the joint system .",
    "these two conditions together are sufficient to ensure that the linear space @xmath39 in which the joint state space @xmath36 and the cone of associated unnormalized states are embedded can be taken to be @xmath40 ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "if simultaneous measurements are performed on systems @xmath34 and @xmath35 , then the joint probability for outcomes @xmath14 and @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 .",
    "it is convenient to define the unit effect of the joint state space as @xmath43 such that a joint state is normalized if @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the unit effects for systems @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively .",
    "naturally , probabilities are positive , so a joint state must satisfy @xmath47 for all @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "the _ maximal tensor product _ of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , denoted @xmath50 , is the set of all @xmath51 such that and are satisfied .",
    "it is easy to check that the no - signalling principle is indeed satisfied for such an @xmath36 .",
    "consider two measurements on @xmath34 , corresponding to sets of effects @xmath52 and @xmath53 . the marginal probability for an outcome @xmath41 of a measurement on @xmath35 is @xmath54 i.e. , it is independent of whether @xmath55 or @xmath56 is performed on @xmath34 .",
    "intuitively , the maximal tensor product is the set of all non - signalling joint states that can be written down for two systems , given the individual state spaces @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "a particular theory or model need not assume that every element of the maximal tensor product is an allowed state for the joint system . in general , a model will specify a joint state space @xmath36 which is a subset of @xmath57 .    straightforwardly generalizing the notions well known from quantum theory ,",
    "one calls a state a _ product state _ if it can be written in the form @xmath58 for some states @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "states that can be written as probabilistic mixtures of product states are _ separable _ , while states that are not separable are _",
    "entangled_.    this work mostly considers correlations obtained from product measurements on bipartite states .",
    "the general formalism , however , does not assume that all measurements on composite systems are product measurements .",
    "as in the case of single systems , outcomes of measurements on a composite system correspond to effects , where these are maps @xmath61 $ ] .",
    "the set of all such effects is written @xmath62 , and may include entangled , as well as product , effects .",
    "however , @xmath63 only contains separable effects .    quantum theory provides a useful example of many of the concepts above . in this case , @xmath36 is the set of density operators on the hilbert space @xmath64 . recall that @xmath65 and @xmath66 are real vector spaces of hermitian operators on @xmath67 and @xmath68 respectively .",
    "the set of hermitian operators on @xmath69 can be identified with @xmath40 , so the joint quantum states are indeed elements of @xmath40 .",
    "the density operators on @xmath69 are a proper subset of @xmath57 .",
    "elements of @xmath57 which are not density operators are ( normalized ) _",
    "entanglement witnesses_. an entanglement witness @xmath70 is locally positive , meaning that for all product measurements , @xmath71 .",
    "but @xmath70 is not a density operator , since there are entangled measurement outcomes @xmath14 with @xmath72 .",
    "this section defines a family of models such that the state spaces @xmath5 of single systems are regular polygons with @xmath0 vertices .",
    "it is convenient to represent both states and effects by vectors in @xmath73 such that @xmath13 is the usual euclidean inner product . for fixed @xmath0 ,",
    "let @xmath5 be the convex hull of @xmath0 pure states @xmath74 , @xmath75 , with @xmath76 where @xmath77 .",
    "the unit effect is @xmath78 in the case of even @xmath0 , the set @xmath24 of all possible measurement outcomes is the convex hull of the zero effect , the unit effect , and @xmath79 , with @xmath80 let @xmath81 , hence a possible dichotomic measurement is @xmath82 .",
    "when this measurement is performed on a system in the state @xmath83 , the probabilities for the two outcomes are given by @xmath84 and @xmath85 , and satisfy @xmath86 .",
    "observe that for even @xmath0 , @xmath87 .",
    "the case of odd @xmath0 is slightly different . in this case , define @xmath88 and again let @xmath81 , so that a possible dichotomic measurement is @xmath82 .",
    "this time , however , @xmath89 does not equal @xmath90 for any @xmath91 .",
    "the set @xmath24 of all possible measurement outcomes is the convex hull of the zero effect , the unit effect , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 .",
    "as can be seen in in such theories there are effects that are extremal in @xmath24 ( namely the @xmath89 ) but not ray extremal , i.e. , they do not lie on an extremal ray of the cone @xmath32 .",
    "this also happens in quantum mechanics , but only if the dimension of the hilbert space is larger than two .",
    "for example the effect @xmath94 for any rank one projector @xmath95 is then extremal in the set of proper effects , but not ray extremal .",
    "a two - dimensional illustration of the state and effect spaces is given in and a three - dimensional illustration in .",
    "the @xmath1 case corresponds to a classical system with three pure states .",
    "think of it as a trit .",
    "the three pure states are @xmath7 , @xmath9 and @xmath96 , and correspond to the three different possible values of the trit .",
    "the state space @xmath5 is a triangle .",
    "a generic point in @xmath5 is a mixture of the three pure states and corresponds to a probability distribution over the three trit values .",
    "notice that in this case , @xmath97 , hence a possible measurement is a three - outcome measurement with outcomes @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "this is the obvious measurement that simply reads off the value of the trit .",
    "below we shall consider bipartite states of polygon systems .",
    "given two trits , the only possible joint states are separable , and it is not possible to produce nonlocal correlations .",
    "the case @xmath2 corresponds to a single system in a toy theory known as ` box world ' , which has been discussed elsewhere in the literature ( see for instance ref .",
    "the state space is a square .",
    "as shown below , a notable feature of box world is that given two of these systems , it is possible to construct joint states that are more nonlocal than quantum states .",
    "in fact , an entangled state of two of the @xmath2 systems can produce maximally nonlocal correlations known as _",
    "correlations @xcite , which have been much explored in the literature @xcite .    as @xmath100",
    ", the state space tends to a disc of radius one .",
    "this makes it similar to a quantum mechanical qubit , whose state space is the bloch ball .",
    "the disc can be thought of as the equatorial plane of the bloch ball",
    ". we will refer to this case , somewhat loosely , as the quantum case .",
    "we shall not attempt a complete characterization of the set of all possible non - signalling states @xmath50 for each value of @xmath0 .",
    "instead , this section describes a particular joint state of two polygon systems , which is the natural analogue of a maximally entangled state of two qubits .",
    "the next section examines the nonlocal correlations that can be obtained from performing measurements on these maximally entangled polygon systems .",
    "recall that a joint state is an element of @xmath40 , hence in the case of two polygon systems , a joint state is an element of @xmath101 .",
    "it is convenient to represent the joint state as a @xmath102 matrix such that @xmath103 can be calculated by simply left and right multiplying this matrix with the representations of the effects @xmath104 and @xmath90 in @xmath73 .",
    "define @xmath105    the state @xmath106 is the natural analogue of a quantum mechanical maximally entangled state for the following reasons .",
    "first , it can be verified ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) that except for @xmath1 , @xmath106 is an entangled pure state , where pure means that it is extremal in the maximal tensor product , hence can not be written as a mixture of other non - signalling states .",
    "the @xmath1 case corresponds to two classical trits , with @xmath106 the maximally correlated state , i.e. , if the trit values are @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , then @xmath106 corresponds to @xmath110 .",
    "second , @xmath106 is constructed so that if a measurement is performed on the @xmath34 system , and outcome @xmath104 obtained , then the updated ( or collapsed ) state for the @xmath35 system is @xmath111 . the marginal probability for alice to obtain outcome @xmath104 is the same for all @xmath112 .",
    "compare this with the case of two spin-1/2 particles in the state @xmath113 , where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the eigenstates of spin-@xmath116 . if a spin measurement in direction @xmath117 in the @xmath118-plane is performed on system @xmath34 ,",
    "then the probability of obtaining the up outcome is @xmath119 , and if the up outcome is obtained , then the collapsed state of the @xmath35 system is spin up in direction @xmath117 .",
    "these quantum predictions are recovered by @xmath106 in the limit @xmath3 .",
    "the following sections investigate the nonlocal correlations that can be produced by performing measurements on two systems in the state @xmath106 .",
    "for this it is useful to have an expression for the joint probability of obtaining outcome @xmath120 on system @xmath34 and @xmath121 on system @xmath35 .",
    "this is easy to calculate from . for even @xmath0 , @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 , and as before , @xmath125 . for odd @xmath0 @xmath126 where @xmath123 and @xmath127 .",
    "notice the cosine dependence , which is reminiscent of quantum mechanical correlations .",
    "one commonly used measure of the degree of nonlocality that a bipartite system exhibits is the maximal violation of the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality @xcite .",
    "the chsh inequality involves two parties , conventionally called alice and bob .",

    "pr box_. as discussed in the introduction , pr boxes have been explored in the literature and are known to be particularly powerful for certain kinds of information theoretic problem , especially communication complexity problems @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to see how the maximal chsh value obtainable from polygon systems in the state @xmath106 varies as the number of vertices @xmath0 of the polygon increases .",
    "the @xmath2 case is particularly simple .",

    "shows the maximal chsh value for the maximally entangled state of polygon systems as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the most important feature of is that the correlations of even @xmath0 systems can always reach or exceed tsirelson s bound , while the correlations of odd @xmath0 systems are always below tsirelson s bound .",
    "thus tsirelson s bound appears as a natural separation between the correlations of these two different kinds of polygon state spaces .",
    "sections [ sec : selfdualityandtsirelsonsbound ] and [ polygonsrevisited ] show why this is .",
    "section [ sec : selfdualityandtsirelsonsbound ] shows that for odd @xmath0 , the maximally entangled state @xmath106 belongs to a broad class of states we call _ inner product states _ , and that all correlations obtainable from measurements on inner product states satisfy tsirelson s bound .",
    "section [ polygonsrevisited ] goes further , and relates this to a fundamental geometric difference between polygons with even @xmath0 and odd @xmath0 . in ,",
    "the difference is seen in the fact that for odd @xmath0 , the effect cone @xmath32 coincides with the state cone @xmath29 , whereas for even @xmath0 , the effect cone is isomorphic to the state cone but rotated through some angle .",

    "an interesting open question , therefore , is the following : what additional property of local state spaces would ensure that all bipartite states give correlations which respect macroscopic locality ?",
    "one suggestion is the constraint that for any ray extremal effect , there is a unique state on which this effect will occur with certainty .",
    "this property is very attractive from a physical point of view .",
    "it allows a natural definition of the post - measurement states of these effects , such that repeating a measurement reproduces the same outcome .",
    "this extra constraint is indeed not satisfied by the house model , since the effect @xmath328 occurs with certainty for both states @xmath7 and @xmath329 , but it is satisfied by odd @xmath0 polygon models .",
    "another possibility that seems to be plausible is that strong self - duality together with the property that all extremal states of the local systems can be transformed into one another reversibly might limit the set of possible correlations to the ones compatible with macroscopic locality .",
    "finally , it is worth emphasizing that two theories which have almost identical local state spaces can lead to dramatically different nonlocal correlations . in particular , given any finite level of accuracy , it is always possible to find a polygon model with an even and sufficiently large number of vertices @xmath0 , which is locally indistinguishable from the quantum - like case , where the state space is a disc .",
    "nevertheless , while quantum correlations are restricted , any non - signalling correlations can be distilled in the former model by using multiple copies of the maximally entangled state .",
