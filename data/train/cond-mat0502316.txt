    "stochastic resonance ( sr ) is now a well established phenomenon wherein the response of a nonlinear system to a subthreshold periodic input signal can be enhanced by the assistance of noise @xcite .",
    "since a single - frequency sinusoidal input conveys little information content , this effect has been extended to aperiodic ( i.e. broadband ) input signals , leading to the term : aperiodic stochastic resonance ( asr ) @xcite . from the point of view of information transmission , the aperiodic information - bearing signal",
    "might be associated with analog ( amplitude and frequency ) modulated signals @xcite , or digitally modulated signals @xcite within the context of sr effects .",
    "the digital pulse amplitude modulated signal is intensively investigated for revealing new asr phenomena or novel applications @xcite .",
    "recently , a new type of electronic receiver based on sr properties has been proposed for retrieval of a subthreshold frequency - shift keying ( fsk ) digitally modulated signals @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "the input information sequences are also represented by equal - energy orthogonal signal waveforms that differ in frequency , i.e. the fsk signals @xcite .",

    "usually , conventional sr or asr characterizes the sr phenomenon with a statistical measurement , resulting from a long - term observational data @xcite .",
    "in contrast , we are more interested in the noise - enhanced effects occurring in each short - term duration of each symbol interval as the noise intensity increases , what we call the short time sr phenomenon in this paper .",
    "the short time sr effect is consistent with detecting weak signals from a short data record @xcite , storing information in a short - term memory device @xcite and exploring transient stimulus - locked coordinated dynamics in terms of mechanisms of short - term adaptation in sensory processing @xcite . from a series of short time sr effects",
    ", the input information contents can be deciphered at the output of the bistable receiver in terms of different signal frequencies .",
    "the sr effects realized in a nonlinear bistable receiver , as will be shown , are not sensitive to adjacent periodic signals with an appropriate frequency separation . in other words ,",
    "the values of the noise intensity at resonance regions or points are close for two adjacent periodic signals .",
    "this nonlinear characteristic of a bistable receiver is then studied for transmitting m - ary fsk digitally modulated signals in detail .",
    "furthermore , the response speed of bistable receivers , independent of the frequency of input signals , is theoretically deduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : iii ] .",
    "in view of the receiver response speed , the mechanism of the m - ary fsk signal detection is explained . finally , we emphasize that the short time sr is not a trivial effect in signal detection , for example , in the detection of bipolar pulse signals with an unknown arrival time @xcite .",
    "the short time sr effect may also be of interest in neurophysiology , even the stimulus exists in a short - term timescale or has a frequency jitter .",
    "neuronal noise , in non - stationary noisy environments , might generically enhance the prediction of the arrival information via the short time sr effect , before the adaptive capabilities of neurons lowers their thresholds to maximize information transmission .",

    "especially worthy of note is that the resonant regions or points of two adjacent frequencies are close .",
