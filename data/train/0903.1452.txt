    "[ [ section ] ]    let @xmath3 be a simple lie algebra of type @xmath4 or @xmath5 , and let @xmath1 denote the corresponding quantum affine algebra , with parameter @xmath6 not a root of unity .",
    "the monoidal category @xmath0 of finite - dimensional @xmath1-modules has been studied by many authors from different perspectives ( see @xcite ) . in particular its simple objects",
    "have been classified by chari and pressley , and nakajima has calculated their character in terms of the cohomology of certain quiver varieties .    in spite of these remarkable results",
    "many basic questions remain open , and in particular little is known about the tensor structure of @xmath0 .    when @xmath7 , chari and pressley @xcite have shown that every simple object is isomorphic to a tensor product of simple objects of a special type called kirillov - reshetikhin modules .",
    "conversely , they have shown that a tensor product @xmath8 of kirillov - reshetikhin modules is simple if and only if @xmath9 is simple for every @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , @xmath9 is simple if and only if @xmath11 and  @xmath12 are `` in general position '' ( a combinatorial condition on the roots of the drinfeld polynomials of @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) .",
    "hence , the kirillov - reshetikhin modules can be regarded as the _ prime _ simple objects of  @xmath0 @xcite , and one knows which products of primes are simple . as an easy corollary",
    ", one can see that the tensor powers of any simple object of @xmath0 are simple .    for @xmath13 ,",
    "the situation is far more complicated .",
    "thus , already for @xmath14 , we do not know a general factorization theorem for simple objects ( see @xcite , where a tentative list of prime simple objects is conjectured ) .",
    "in fact , it was shown in @xcite that the tensor square of a simple object of @xmath0 is not necessarily simple in general , so one should not expect results similar to the @xmath15 case for other lie algebras @xmath3 .    because of these difficulties , we decide in this paper to focus on some smaller subcategories .",
    "we introduce a sequence @xmath16 of full monoidal subcategories of @xmath0 , whose objects are characterized by certain strong restrictions on the roots of the drinfeld polynomials of their composition factors . by construction ,",
    "the grothendieck ring @xmath17 of @xmath18 is a polynomial ring in @xmath19 variables , where @xmath20 is the rank of @xmath3 .",
    "our starting point is that @xmath17 is naturally equipped with the structure of a cluster algebra .",
    "recall that cluster algebras were introduced by fomin and zelevinsky @xcite as a combinatorial device for studying canonical bases and total positivity .",
    "they found immediately lots of applications , including a proof of a conjecture of zamolodchikov concerning certain discrete dynamical systems arising from the thermodynamic bethe ansatz , called @xmath21-systems @xcite .",
    "as observed by kuniba , nakanishi and suzuki @xcite , @xmath21-systems are strongly related with the representation theory of @xmath1 via some other systems of functional relations called @xmath22-systems .",
    "it was conjectured in @xcite that the characters of the kirillov - reshetikhin modules are solutions of a @xmath22-system , and this was later proved by nakajima @xcite in the simply - laced case , and by hernandez in the general case @xcite .",
    "now it is easy to notice that in the simply - laced case the equations of a @xmath22-system are exactly of the same form as the exchange relations in a cluster algebra .",
    "this led us to introduce a cluster algebra structure on @xmath17 by using an initial seed consisting of a choice of @xmath23 kirillov - reshetikhin modules in @xmath24 .",
    "the exchange matrix of this seed encodes @xmath25 equations of the @xmath22-system satisfied by these kirillov - reshetikhin modules .",
    "( note that the seed contains @xmath20 frozen variables  or coefficients  in the sense of @xcite . ) by definition of a cluster algebra , one can obtain new seeds by applying sequences of mutations to the initial seed .",
    "then one of our main conjectures is that all the new cluster variables produced in this way are classes of simple objects of @xmath24 .",
    "( note that in general , these simple objects are no longer kirillov - reshetikhin modules . )",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    for @xmath26 , the cluster structure of @xmath27 is trivial : there is a unique cluster consisting entirely of frozen variables .",
    "the case @xmath28 is already very interesting , and most of this paper will be devoted to it .",
    "recall that fomin and zelevinsky have classified the cluster algebras with finitely many cluster variables in terms of finite root systems @xcite .",
    "it turns out that for every @xmath3 the ring @xmath29 has finitely many cluster variables , and that its cluster type coincides with the root system of  @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , one may expect that the tensor structure of the simple objects of the category @xmath30 can be described in `` a finite way '' .",
    "in fact we conjecture that for every @xmath3 the category @xmath30 behaves as nicely as the category @xmath0 for @xmath15 , and we prove it for @xmath3 of type @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "more precisely , we single out a finite set of simple objects of @xmath30 whose drinfeld polynomials are naturally labeled by the set of almost positive roots of @xmath3 ( , positive roots and negative simple roots ) .",
    "recall that the almost positive roots are in one - to - one correspondence with the cluster variables @xcite , so we shall call these objects the _ cluster simple objects_. to these objects we add @xmath20 distinguished simple objects which we call _ frozen simple objects_.",
    "our first claim is that the classes of these objects in @xmath29 coincide with the cluster variables and frozen variables .",
    "recall also that the cluster variables are grouped into overlapping subsets of cardinality @xmath20 called clusters @xcite .",
    "the number of clusters is a generalized catalan number , and they can be identified with the faces of the dual of a generalized associahedron @xcite .",
    "our second claim is that a tensor product of cluster simple objects is simple if and only if all the objects belong to a common cluster .",
    "moreover , the tensor product of a frozen simple object with any simple object is again simple .",
    "it follows that every simple object of @xmath30 is a tensor product of cluster simple objects and frozen simple objects . as a consequence ,",
    "the tensor powers of any simple object of @xmath30 are simple .    to prove this , we show that a tensor product @xmath8 of simple objects of @xmath30 is simple if and only if @xmath9 is simple for every @xmath33 .",
    "this result is proved uniformly for all types .",
    "note that only the frozen objects and the cluster objects attached to positive simple roots and negative simple roots are kirillov - reshetikhin modules .",
    "the remaining cluster objects ( labelled by the positive non simple roots ) probably deserve to be studied more closely .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    when @xmath34 the ring @xmath17 has in general infinitely many cluster variables , grouped into infinitely many clusters .",
    "a notable exception is the case @xmath7 , for which @xmath17 is a cluster algebra of finite type @xmath35 in the classification of @xcite . in this special case",
    "it follows from @xcite that , again , the classes in @xmath17 of the simple objects of @xmath24 are precisely the cluster monomials of @xmath17 .",
    "we conjecture that for arbitrary @xmath3 and @xmath36 , every cluster monomial of @xmath17 is the class of a simple object .",
    "we also conjecture that , conversely , the class of a simple object @xmath37 in @xmath24 is a cluster monomial if and only if @xmath38 is simple . in this case , following @xcite , we call @xmath37 a _ real simple object_. we believe that real simple objects form an interesting class of irreducible @xmath1-modules , and the meaning of our partial results and conjectures is that their characters are governed by the combinatorics of cluster algebras .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    let us now describe the contents of the paper in more detail .",
    "in section  [ sect3 ] we recall the definition of a cluster algebra , and we introduce the new notion of monoidal categorification of a cluster algebra ( definition  [ defmoncat ] ) .",
    "we show ( proposition  [ positivity ] ) that the existence of a monoidal categorification gives an immediate answer to some important open problems in the theory of cluster algebras , like the linear independence of cluster monomials , or the positivity of the coefficients of their expansion with respect to an arbitrary cluster .",
    "in section  [ sect2 ] we briefly review the theory of finite - dimensional representations of @xmath1 and we introduce the categories @xmath24 .",
    "we also recall the definition of the kirillov - reshetikhin modules and we review the @xmath22-system of equations that they satisfy .    in section  [ sect4 ] we introduce some simple objects @xmath39 of @xmath30 attached to the almost positive roots @xmath40 , and we formulate our conjecture ( conjecture  [ mainconjecture ] ) for the category @xmath30 .",
    "it states that @xmath30 is a monoidal categorification of a cluster algebra @xmath41 with the same dynkin type as @xmath3 , and that the @xmath39 are the cluster simple objects .",
    "we illustrate the conjecture in type @xmath42 .",
    "in section  [ sect6 ] we review the definition and main properties of the @xmath43-characters of frenkel - reshetikhin .",
    "one of the main tools to calculate them is the frenkel - mukhin algorithm which we recall and illustrate with examples .    in section  [ secttrunc ]",
    ", we introduce some truncated versions of the @xmath43-characters for @xmath30 .",
    "these new truncated characters are much easier to calculate and they contain all the information to determine the composition factors of an object of @xmath30 .",
    "the main result of this section ( proposition  [ prop33 ] ) is an explicit formula for the truncated @xmath43-character of @xmath39 when @xmath40 is a multiplicity - free positive root .    in section  [ sectfpol ] ,",
    "we review following @xcite the @xmath44-polynomials of the cluster algebra @xmath41 .",
    "these are variants of the fibonacci polynomials of @xcite , which are the building blocks of the general solution of a @xmath21-system .",
    "they satisfy a functional equation similar to a @xmath22-system and each cluster variable can be expressed in terms of its @xmath44-polynomial in a simple way ( equation  ( [ eqfpol1 ] ) ) .",
    "we show that conjecture  [ mainconjecture ]  ( i ) is equivalent to the fact that the ( normalized ) truncated @xmath43-characters of the cluster simple objects are equal to the @xmath44-polynomials , and we prove it for the multiplicity - free roots ( theorem  [ multfreeequal ] ) .    in section  [ sectensprod ] , we prove an important tensor product theorem for the category @xmath30 ( theorem  [ thtensprod ] ) : if @xmath45 are simple objects of @xmath30 , then @xmath46 is simple if and only if @xmath9 is simple for every @xmath33 .    in section  [ sectclusterexp ]",
    ", we introduce following @xcite the notions of compatible roots and cluster expansion . because of theorem  [ thtensprod ] and of the existence and uniqueness of a cluster expansion @xcite , we reduce conjecture  [ mainconjecture ]  ( ii ) for a given @xmath3 to a finite check : one has to verify that @xmath47 is simple for every pair @xmath48 of compatible roots .",
    "in section  [ secttypa ] and section  [ secttypd ] we prove conjecture  [ mainconjecture ] in type @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "conjecture  [ mainconjecture ]  ( i ) is proved more generally in type @xmath49 , by showing that the truncated @xmath43-characters of cluster simple objects are given by the explicit combinatorial formula of @xcite for the fibonacci polynomials of 2-restricted roots .    in section  [ sectappl ]",
    "we present some applications of our results for @xmath30 .",
    "first we show that the @xmath43-characters of the simple objects of @xmath30 are solutions of a system of functional equations similar to a periodic @xmath22-system .",
    "secondly , we explain that the @xmath50-weight multiplicities appearing in the truncated @xmath43-characters of the cluster simple objects are equal to some tensor product multiplicities .",
    "this is reminiscent of the kostka duality for representations of @xmath51 , but in our case it is not limited to type  @xmath52 .",
    "thirdly , we exploit some known geometric formulas for @xmath44-polynomials due to fu and keller @xcite to express the coefficients of the truncated @xmath43-characters of the simple objects of @xmath30 as euler characteristics of some quiver grassmannians .",
    "this is similar to the nakajima character formula for standard modules , but our formula works for simple modules .    finally in section  [ sect9 ]",
    "we state our conjectures for @xmath24 ( arbitrary @xmath36 ) and illustrate them for @xmath53 ( arbitrary @xmath36 ) where they follow from @xcite , and @xmath14 ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "we also explain how our conjecture for @xmath55 ( arbitrary @xmath36 ) would essentially follow from a general conjecture of @xcite about the relation between lusztig s dual canonical and dual semicanonical bases .",
    "[ [ section-4 ] ]    kedem @xcite and di francesco @xcite have studied another connection between quantum affine algebras and cluster algebras , based on other types of functional equations ( @xmath56-systems and generalized @xmath22-systems ) .",
    "keller @xcite has obtained a proof of the periodicity conjecture for @xmath21-systems attached to pairs of simply - laced dynkin diagrams using 2-calabi - yau categorifications of cluster algebras .",
    "more recently , inoue , iyama , kuniba , nakanishi and suzuki @xcite have also studied the connection between @xmath21-systems , @xmath22-systems , grothendieck rings of @xmath1 and cluster algebras , motivated by periodicity problems .",
    "these papers do not study the relations between cluster monomials and irreducible @xmath1-modules .",
    "after this paper was submitted for publication , nakajima @xcite gave a geometric proof of conjecture  [ mainconjecture ] for all types @xmath57 , using a tensor category of perverse sheaves on quiver varieties .",
    "this category also makes sense for non dynkin quivers and nakajima showed that its grothendieck ring has a cluster algebra structure and that all cluster monomials are classes of simple objects .",
    "thanks to proposition  [ positivity ] below , this yields strong positivity results for every acyclic cluster algebra with a bipartite seed . to the best of our knowledge , our conjecture for @xmath34 remains open .",
    "we have presented our main results in several seminars and conferences in 2008 and 2009 ( ihp paris ( bl ) , msri berkeley ( bl ) , ntua athens ( bl ) , eth zurich ( dh ) , unam mexico ( dh ) , math . institute oxford ( dh ) , mio oberwolfach ( bl ) ) .",
    "we thank these institutions for their kind invitations .",
    "special thanks are due to arun ram and msri for organizing in spring 2008 a program on combinatorial representation theory where a large part of this work was done .",
    "we also thank keller for his preliminary oberwolfach report on this work @xcite .",
    "finally we thank nakajima for helpful comments and stimulating discussions .",
    "[ [ section-5 ] ]    we refer to @xcite for an excellent survey on cluster algebras . here",
    "we only recall the main definitions and results .    [ [ defcluster ] ]    let @xmath58 be some fixed integers . if @xmath59 is an @xmath60-matrix with integer entries , then the _ principal part _",
    "@xmath61 of @xmath62 is the square matrix obtained from @xmath62 by deleting the last @xmath20 rows .",

    "one calls @xmath68 the _ mutation _ of the matrix @xmath62 in direction @xmath69 .",
    "if @xmath62 is an integer matrix whose principal part is skew - symmetric , then it is easy to check that @xmath68 is also an integer matrix with skew - symmetric principal part .",
    "we will assume from now on that @xmath62 has skew - symmetric principal part .",
    "in this case , one can equivalently encode @xmath62 by a quiver @xmath70 with vertex set @xmath71 and with @xmath72 arrows from @xmath73 to @xmath74 if @xmath75 and @xmath76 arrows from @xmath74 to @xmath73 if @xmath77 . note that @xmath70 has no loop nor 2-cycle .",
    "now fomin and zelevinsky define a cluster algebra @xmath78 as follows .",
    "let @xmath79 be the field of rational functions in @xmath80 commuting indeterminates @xmath81 .",

    "one can iterate this procedure and obtain new seeds by mutating @xmath85 in any direction @xmath90 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath91 denote the set of all seeds obtained from @xmath82 by any finite sequence of mutations .",
    "each seed of @xmath91 consists of an @xmath80-tuple of elements of @xmath92 called a _ cluster _ , and of a matrix .",
    "the elements of a cluster are its _",
    "cluster variables_. every seed has @xmath93 neighbours obtained by a single mutation in direction @xmath83 .",
    "one does not mutate the last @xmath20 elements of a cluster ; they are called _ frozen variables _ and belong to every cluster .",
    "we then define the _ cluster algebra _",
    "@xmath78 as the subring of @xmath92 generated by all the cluster variables of the seeds of @xmath91 .",
    "the integer @xmath93 is called the _ rank _ of @xmath78 .    a _ cluster monomial _ is a monomial in the cluster variables of a _ single _ cluster .",
    "note that the exchange relation ( [ mutationformula ] ) is of the form @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are two cluster monomials .",
    "[ [ clusterres ] ]    the first important result of the theory is that every cluster variable @xmath97 of @xmath78 is a laurent polynomial in @xmath87 with coefficients in @xmath98 .",
    "it is conjectured that the coefficients are positive .",
    "note that because of ( [ mutationformula ] ) , every cluster variable can be written as a subtraction free rational expression in @xmath87 , but this is not enough to ensure the positivity of its laurent expansion .",
    "the second main result is the classification of _ cluster algebras of finite type _",
    ", with finitely many different cluster variables .",
    "fomin and zelevinsky proved that this happens if and only if there exists a seed @xmath99 such that the quiver attached to the principal part of @xmath100 is a dynkin quiver ( that is , an arbitrary orientation of a dynkin diagram of type @xmath57 ) . in this case , the cluster monomials form a distinguished subset of @xmath78 , which is conjectured to be a @xmath98-basis @xcite .",
    "if @xmath78 is not of finite cluster type , the cluster monomials do not span it , but it is conjectured that they are linearly independent .",
    "it is an interesting open problem to specify a `` canonical '' @xmath98-basis of @xmath78 containing the cluster monomials .",
    "[ [ section-6 ] ]    we now propose a natural framework which would yield positive answers to the above questions .",
    "we say that a simple object @xmath37 of a monoidal category is _ prime _ if there exists no non trivial factorization @xmath101 .",
    "we say that @xmath37 is _ real _ if @xmath38 is simple .",
    "[ defmoncat ] let @xmath41 be a cluster algebra and let @xmath102 be an abelian monoidal category .",
    "we say that @xmath102 is a monoidal categorification of @xmath41 if the grothendieck ring of @xmath102 is isomorphic to @xmath41 , and if    * the cluster monomials of @xmath41 are the classes of all the real simple objects of @xmath102 ; * the cluster variables of @xmath41 ( including the frozen ones ) are the classes of all the real prime simple objects of @xmath102 .",
    "the existence of a monoidal categorification of a cluster algebra is a very strong property , as shown by the following result .",
    "[ positivity ] suppose that the cluster algebra @xmath41 has a monoidal categorification @xmath102 .",
    "then    * every cluster variable of @xmath41 has a laurent expansion with positive coefficients with respect to any cluster ; * the cluster monomials of @xmath41 are linearly independent .",
    "if @xmath103 is a cluster monomial , we denote by @xmath104 the simple object with class @xmath105=m$ ] .",
    "let @xmath97 be a cluster variable , and let @xmath106 denote its cluster expansion with respect to the cluster @xmath81 . here",
    "the numerator @xmath107 is a polynomial with coefficients in @xmath98 .",
    "multiplying both sides by the denominator , we see that @xmath107 is the class of the tensor product @xmath108 moreover , since @xmath87 is a cluster , every monomial @xmath109 is the class of a simple object @xmath110 of @xmath102 .",
    "hence the coefficient of @xmath103 in @xmath107 is equal to the multiplicity of @xmath111 as a composition factor of @xmath112 , thus it is nonnegative .",
    "this proves ( i ) .    by definition of a monoidal categorification , the cluster monomials form a subset of the set of classes of all simple objects of @xmath102 , which is a @xmath98-basis of the grothendieck group",
    "this proves ( ii ) .",
    "( i )   in recent years , many examples of categorifications of cluster algebras have been constructed ( see @xcite ) .",
    "they are quite different from the monoidal categorifications introduced in this paper .",
    "indeed , these categories are only additive and have no tensor operation .",
    "the multiplication of the cluster algebra reflects the direct sum operation of the category .",
    "we shall call these categorifications _",
    "additive_. note that there is no analogue of proposition  [ positivity ] for additive categorifications .",
    "although additive categorifications have been helpful for proving positivity of cluster expansions or linear independence of cluster monomials in some cases , this always requires some additional work , for example to show the positivity of some euler characteristics . finally , to recover the cluster algebra from its additive categorification",
    "one does not consider the grothendieck group ( which would be too small ) but a kind of `` dual hall algebra '' constructed via a _ cluster character_. this is in general a complicated procedure .",
    "( ii )   in view of the strength and simplicity of proposition  [ positivity ] , one might wonder whether there exist any examples of monoidal categorifications of cluster algebras .",
    "one of the aims of this paper is to produce some examples using representations of quantum affine algebras .",
    "( iii )   let @xmath102 be an abelian monoidal category . if @xmath102 is a monoidal categorification of a cluster algebra @xmath41 , then we get new combinatorial insights about the tensor structure of @xmath102 .",
    "in particular if @xmath41 has finite cluster type , we can express any simple object of @xmath102 as a tensor product of finitely many prime objects , and this yields a combinatorial algorithm to calculate the composition factors of a tensor product of simple objects of @xmath102 .",
    "so this can be a fruitful approach to study certain interesting monoidal categories @xmath102 .",
    "this is the point of view we adopt in this paper .",
    "in this section we briefly review some known results in the representation theory of quantum affine algebras . for more detailed surveys we refer the reader to the monograph @xcite and the recent paper @xcite .    [",

    "moreover , the functors @xmath1408 are multiplicative in the following sense : for @xmath1410 in @xmath1411 and @xmath1412 in @xmath1413 one has @xmath1414 where @xmath1415 denotes the induction product from @xmath1416 to @xmath1417 . let @xmath1418 be the sum over @xmath103 of the grothendieck groups of the categories @xmath1406 endowed with the multiplication induced by @xmath1419 .",

    "so , to summarize , for @xmath3 of type @xmath31 , conjecture  [ mainconjecture2 ] can be reformulated as a conjecture about multiplicative properties of the dual canonical basis of @xmath1429 $ ] . in @xcite , a cluster algebra structure on",
    "@xmath1429 $ ] has been studied in relation with the representation theory of preprojective algebras .",

    "more precisely they are the elements parametrized by the irreducible components of the nilpotent varieties with an open orbit .",
    "it was also conjectured that these elements of the dual semicanonical basis belong to the dual canonical basis , hence , by ariki s theorem , are classes of irreducible representations of some @xmath1432 .",

    "it then follows from [ typeal ] that conjecture  [ mainconjecture2 ] holds if @xmath1434 , and moreover in this case all simple objects of @xmath24 are real .",

    "[ 2,3,\\ldots , n+2],\\ \\ldots , \\ [ \\ell+2,\\ell+3,\\ldots , n+\\ell+2],\\ ] ] belong to the subset of frozen variables of the cluster algebra @xmath1438 $ ] .",
    "hence , the quotient ring @xmath1442 of @xmath1438 $ ] obtained by specializing these variables to 1 is also a cluster algebra , with the same principal part . by comparing the initial seed of @xmath1352 with the initial seed of @xmath1442 obtained from (",

    "so we can reformulate conjecture  [ mainconjecture2 ] for @xmath1443 by stating that _",
    "@xmath24 should be a monoidal categorification of the quotient ring @xmath1442 of @xmath1438 $ ] by the relations @xmath1441= [ 2,3,\\ldots , n+2]=\\cdots = [ \\ell+2,\\ell+3,\\ldots , n+\\ell+2]=1.\\ ] ] _ note that for @xmath7 we recover the situation of  [ cptypea1 ] .",
