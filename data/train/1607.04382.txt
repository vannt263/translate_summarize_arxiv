    "developing a first - principle based approach for quantum thermal transport across low - dimensional systems not only provides insight to potential nanodevice applications , but is also crucial to better understand nonequilibrium statistical physics . till date , quantum thermal transport across harmonic crystals has been extensively studied using the generalized langevin approach  @xcite , nonequilibrium green s function method  @xcite , or the density matrix approach @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of these methods lies in their exactness of treating harmonic systems , giving rise to ballistic transport .",
    "on the other hand , recent progress in classical thermal transport has demonstrated interesting practical applications , such as thermal diode , thermal transistor , and thermal logic gates  @xcite .",
    "these studies suggest that the ability to manipulate thermal transport may lead to important technological breakthrough ranging from novel devices to improvement of thermal management in microelectronics , and even information processing by phonons .",
    "unfortunately , the exactly solvable harmonic crystals do not exhibit these novel properties and it turns out that anharmonicity is one of the key ingredients for their occurrence .    naturally , anharmonic systems are of great interest in order to deduce the basic microscopic origin of these novel properties .",
    "hence in the classical regime the effective phonon theory @xcite and the self - consistent phonon theory @xcite were developed to study thermal transport for highly anharmonic systems .",
    "the former was based on the equipartition theorem , whereas the latter took advantage of the feynman - jensen inequality . in the quantum regime ,",
    "the role of anharmonicity is even more enticing but relatively unexplored .",
    "a plethora of techniques for weakly anharmonic systems have been developed in this regime @xcite , but a robust theory for strong anharmonicity still eludes the community .",
    "one of the popular techniques to treat the strongly anharmonic quantum regime is based on the quantum master equation that treats the system - bath interaction perturbatively @xcite . despite its ability to treat anharmonicity exactly",
    ", one major disadvantage is its inability to treat large phononic systems .",
    "this is mainly because this method operates in the eigenbasis of the system that increases rapidly with temperature or number of particles .",
    "hence , an approach that can deal with relatively large systems is critical to understand the role of strong anharmonicity in thermal transport .    in this paper",
    "we will propose a feasible and effective approach to study thermal transport through anharmonic systems .",
    "the key idea here is to renormalize the anharmonic hamiltonian to an effective harmonic hamiltonian using the quantum self - consistent phonon theory @xcite .",
    "we then apply the standard nonequilibrium green s function machinery to study the effective harmonic model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we introduce the anharmonic model and propose a modified caroli formula for thermal transport based on the quantum self - consistent phonon theory .",
    "we then corroborate our quantum self - consistent approach with the help of quantum master equation for mono- and di - atomic molecular junctions in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] .",
    "finally , we demonstrate an intriguing application of our method by investigating thermal rectification in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] .",
    "finally , we summarize our main conclusions in sec .",

    "the left and right harmonic baths are at temperatures @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "the central system consists of harmonic plus anharmonic interactions depicted by the periodic potential ]    we consider the minimal model for thermal transport ( as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_model ] ) that consists of a general one - dimensional system linearly coupled to two semi - infinite chain of harmonic oscillators , herein referred to as heat baths .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian @xmath2 of the total system reads @xcite , @xmath3 where @xmath4 describes the system of interest , \\{@xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 } are the positions , conjugate momenta , masses , and frequency modes of the left ( @xmath9 ) and right ( @xmath10 ) bath .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 is the system - bath coupling constant of the @xmath12-th mode corresponding to the left ( @xmath9 ) and right ( @xmath10 ) bath .",
    "the system operator @xmath13 couples the system to the @xmath14-th bath and in general it can be any system operator or its function . the above hamiltonian is commonly referred to as the zwanzig - caldeira - legett model @xcite that can be split into various regions as , @xmath15 the bath hamiltonian @xmath16 the system - bath interaction hamiltonian @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the collective bath operator that couples with the system and @xmath19 is known as the re - normalization ( counter ) term . in this work since we will couple the system to the bath via the position - position coupling the re - normalization term is essential to maintain translational invariance of the total system . in the above equations @xmath20 corresponds to the left bath and @xmath21 corresponds to the right bath . in order to simplify the description ,",
    "we have considered a one dimensional model , but our theory described below can be easily generalized to higher dimensions . the main difficulty to calculate heat current using the above hamiltonian lies in the anharmonic interactions present in the system . to tackle such anharmonic interactions we apply the quantum self consistent phonon theory ( qscpt ) to obtain an effective harmonic system @xcite and then obtain the heat current using the machinery of nonequilibrium green s function ( negf ) @xcite through the effective model .    without loss of generality ,",
    "we consider the system as a one - dimensional oscillator chain of the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the nearest - neighbor interaction and onsite potential respectively . the partition function in the canonical ensemble can be expressed as a path integral over all possible trajectories , i.e. , @xmath25}{\\hbar}},\\ ] ] where the measure of functional integral @xmath26 and @xmath27=\\int_0^{\\hbar\\beta}d\\tau\\left(\\frac{m}{2}\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}^2+w(\\delta \\mathbf{x})+v[\\mathbf{x}]\\right).\\ ] ] in the action @xmath28 $ ] above",
    ", @xmath29 and @xmath30 are implicit functions of the time variable @xmath31 .",
    "the key idea of quantum self - consistent phonon theory ( qscpt ) is to replace the original euclidean action , eq .",
    "( [ s2-eq - action ] ) , by an approximate one . in order to do this",
    "we make a reasonable choice of the trial hamiltonian @xmath32 where the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 are to be deduced by minimizing the right hand side of the feynman - jensen inequality @xcite : @xmath35 where @xmath36 . the trial partition function @xmath37}{\\hbar}},\\ ] ] where @xmath38 = \\int_0^{\\hbar\\beta}d\\tau\\left(m\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}^2+f_{c}\\delta \\mathbf{x}^{2}+f\\mathbf{x}^{2}\\right)/2 $ ] .",

    "( [ s2-eq - feynman ] ) is computed based on the trial hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ s2-eq - hamiltonianeff ] ) that can be easily calculated since the integrand takes a quadratic form .",
    "finally , the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 can be obtained by solving the following self - consistent equations : @xmath39,\\\\ \\label{eq : rho } \\rho^{2}&=&\\langle x_{k}^{2}\\rangle \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{\\hbar}{2nm}\\sum_{p}\\frac{1}{\\omega_{p}}\\coth\\left(\\frac { \\beta\\hbar\\omega_{p}}{2}\\right),\\\\ \\label{eq : drho } \\delta\\rho^{2}&\\equiv&\\langle(x_{k}-x_{k-1})^{2}\\rangle \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{\\hbar}{2nm}\\sum_{p } \\frac{4\\sin^{2}(p\\pi / n)}{\\omega_{p}}\\coth\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\hbar\\omega_{p}}{2}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 , @xmath41 and the variables @xmath42 and @xmath43 implicitly depend on @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "note that the canonical average is performed at the average temperature @xmath44 , which requires that the heat baths have minimal influence on the system .",
    "this assumption could be accomplished in a variety of scenarios , e.g. , when the system - bath coupling is weak and the temperature difference is small or when the system is comprised of various segments each strongly interacting with its own bath and weakly interacting with each other .",
    "it is worth noting here that although the effective phonon theory @xcite is similar to the quantum self - consistent phonon theory ( qscpt ) described above , it does not capture the essential quantum physics since it relies on the validity of the equipartition theorem .",
    "this serves as our main motivation to use the qscpt and study _ quantum _ thermal transport .",
    "therefore , given the effective hamiltonian the model described by eq .",
    "( [ s2-eq - hamiltonian ] ) is approximated as , @xmath45 using the standard techniques to treat harmonic systems @xcite we obtain the steady state heat current given by the landauer - like formula as , @xmath46 the above formula is valid for any temperature difference between the left and right baths .",

    "the effective force matrix @xmath53 above is tridiagonal and @xmath54 .",
    "it is important to note that the transmission function @xmath47 here is temperature dependent for anharmonic systems , since the trial parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 are temperature dependent .",
    "hence , owing to this inherent temperature dependence due to the self - consistent equations ( [ eq : wp ] , [ eq : rho ] , and [ eq : drho ] ) we herein term eq .",
    "( [ eq : caroli ] ) as the modified caroli formula .",
    "such a temperature dependent transmission function has been observed previously in the context of mean - field approximations @xcite .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that qscpt @xcite has previously been used to evaluate the thermal conductivity via the kinetic theory as @xmath55 with @xmath56 being the heat capacity , @xmath57 the phonon velocity , and @xmath58 being the mean free path @xcite .",
    "it is in this work that we for the first time integrate the qscpt with negf giving the `` quantum self - consistent approach '' a firm theoretical basis to be applied in the nonequilibrium _ quantum _ regime .",
    "the theory outlined above is a general approach applicable to any anharmonic system that can be approximated as a harmonic one . in this section",
    ", we will take specific examples of the system hamiltonian @xmath4 , i.e. , a monoatomic molecule confined in a quartic potential and a diatomic molecule with a quartic interaction and/or onsite potential .",
    "the concerned system is linearly connected to two heat baths via the position operator , i.e. , @xmath59 for monatomic molecule and @xmath60 for the diatomic case . in order to specify all properties of the baths we define a spectral density @xmath61 that incorporates the effect of system - bath coupling since it is proportional to @xmath62 . above @xmath63",
