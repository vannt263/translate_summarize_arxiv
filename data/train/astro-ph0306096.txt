    "the structure of galaxies is closely linked to their formation and evolution , and therefore provides a vital testing ground for the cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm which has proven so successful on large scales ( e.g. , spergel et al .",
    "the primary observable is the shape of the radial mass profile , from which the relative distributions of luminous and dark matter can be determined .",
    "the outermost regions of galaxies have now been extensively probed using weak lensing ( e.g. , fischer et al .",
    "2000 ; mckay et al .  2001 ; kleinheinrich et al .",
    "2003 ) and satellite dynamics ( e.g. , zaritsky et al .  1997 ; romanowsky & kochanek 2001 ; mckay et al .  2002",
    "; prada et al .",
    "2003 ) , each of which reveals an extended dark matter halo out to @xmath9 .",
    "methods for tracing the inner regions of galaxies largely depend on the galaxy morphology .",
    "spiral galaxies are the most easily studied , and are consequently the best understood , as rotation curves can be mapped to @xmath10 using kinematic tracers such as hi .",
    "flat rotation curves at @xmath11 clearly indicate the presence of dark matter ( e.g. , rubin , thonnard & ford 1980 ) , but dynamical observations also suggest that the inner halo may be significantly less concentrated ( e.g. , mcgaugh & de blok 1998 ; de blok et al.2001 ; salucci 2001 ; de blok & bosma 2002 ) than the cuspy halos predicted by cdm simulations ( e.g. , moore et al .  1999b ; bullock et al .  2001 ) .    compared to their late - type counterparts , early - type ( elliptical and lenticular ; e / s0 ) galaxies are not as well understood . some of the best evidence for dark matter outside of a few optical radii has been obtained from investigations of the extended , x - ray emitting gas ( e.g. , fabbiano 1989 ; matsushita et al .  1998 ; loewenstein & white 1999 ) .",
    "the inner regions of early - type galaxies are typically probed using stellar dynamics ( e.g. , rix et al .",
    "1997 ; gerhard et al.2001 ) . however , the velocity dispersion is not an unambiguous tracer of the mass profile , as it requires an understanding of the orbital anisotropy .",
    "in addition , the existence of a tight fundamental plane ( fp ; djorgovski & davis 1987 ; dressler et al .",
    "1987 ) presumably provides clues about the inner structure of early - type galaxies , but little consensus has been achieved regarding its meaning ( e.g. , faber et al .",
    "1987 ; renzini & ciotti 1993 ; van albada , bertin & stiavelli 1995 ; ciotti , lanzoni & renzini 1996 ; pahre , de carvalho , & djorgovski 1998 ; bertin , ciotti , & del principe 2002 ) .",
    "many outstanding questions therefore remain regarding the structure of e / s0 galaxies , the universality of this structure , and its relation to the predictions of cdm models .",
    "strong gravitational lensing is a powerful and unique tool for investigating the mass distributions in early - type galaxies at intermediate redshift , as it probes mass directly .",
    "first , model - independent projected masses may be inferred from the geometry of the lensed images ( e.g. , schneider , ehlers & falco 1992 ) .",
    "when mass models are normalized by this constraint , the stellar velocity dispersion becomes a far more sensitive probe of the radial mass profile .",
    "ongoing efforts by the lens structure and dynamics ( lsd ) survey ( koopmans & treu 2002 , 2003 ; treu & koopmans 2002a ; collectively `` kt '' ) have made significant progress in obtaining and interpreting dynamical measurements in gravitational lens systems .",
    "second , models of the galaxy mass distribution can be constructed based on the positions , morphologies and flux ratios of the lensed images . of particular importance are the additional astrometric constraints obtained from complex structure in the lensed source , which can be used to break degeneracies and distinguish among radial mass profiles .",
    "these constraints include large - scale extended emission from radio lobes ( e.g. , kochanek 1995 ) or quasar host galaxies ( see , e.g. , kochanek , keeton , & mcleod 2001 and saha & williams 2001 for general discussions ) , lensed images of multi - component sources ( e.g. , cohn et al .",
    "2001 ; muoz , kochanek & keeton 2001 ) , and the relative orientations of milliarcsecond - scale radio jets ( e.g. , rusin et al.2002 ; winn , rusin & kochanek 2003 ) .",
    "the mass distributions in several lens galaxies have now been investigated using either direct modeling or stellar dynamics . in all but one case ,",
    "the profile is consistent with an isothermal model ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the lone exception is pg1115 + 080 , for which the high stellar velocity dispersion ( tonry 1998 ) suggests a mass profile steeper than isothermal ( @xmath13 ; treu & koopmans 2002b ) , although this also implies that the galaxy lies well off the fp .",
    "the lensing results are therefore generally consistent with the nearly isothermal profiles favored by x - ray and dynamical studies of local elliptical galaxies .",
    "understanding the mass profiles of lens galaxies is required for the determination of the hubble constant ( @xmath14 ) from measured time delays .",
    "kochanek ( 2002 ) demonstrates that the predicted delay between two images , and hence the derived value of @xmath15 , is primarily governed by the average surface mass density in the annulus defined by their radial distances from the lens center , with a small correction for the slope of the profile in this annulus .",
    "each of these quantities is determined by the shape of the radial mass profile .",
    "based on a study of several lens systems which are dominated by a single galaxy and have well - measured time delays , kochanek ( 2002 ) finds @xmath16 if lenses are isothermal . this value is lower than those obtained from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) key project ( @xmath17 ; freedman et al .",
    "2001 ) and wmap data ( @xmath18 , although this requires the assumption of a flat cosmology and a dark energy equation of state of @xmath19 ; spergel et al .",
    "in fact , kochanek ( 2002 , 2003 ) shows that early - type galaxies must be described by models in which mass traces light , and hence have no extended dark matter halos , to reconcile current time delay measurements with @xmath20 ( see also williams & saha 2000 ) . this apparent discrepancy with other observational constraints and the cdm paradigm demands continued examination of the lens galaxy population .",
    "decomposing the luminous and dark matter components of early - type galaxies is also potentially important for investigating the nature of flux ratio discrepancies in gravitational lens systems .",
    "it has now been extensively demonstrated that simple , smooth mass models have great difficulty reproducing the observed flux ratios in four - image lenses ( e.g. , dalal & kochanek 2002 ; metcalf & zhao 2002 ; chiba 2002 ; keeton , gaudi & petters 2002 ) , both in the optical and radio . the effect has been traced to small - scale structure in the gravitational potential ( kochanek & dalal 2003 ) , and can be due to either stars ( microlensing ; e.g. , witt , mao , & schechter 1995 ; schechter & wambsganss 2002 ) or cdm satellite halos ( millilensing ; e.g. , mao & schneider 1998 ; metcalf & madau 2001 ; bradac et al.2002 ; chiba 2002 ; dalal & kochanek 2002 ) . both phenomena are surely present , as radio sources are generally too large to be affected by stars , while uncorrelated time variability is an unmistakable signature of stellar microlensing in some optical lenses ( e.g. , wozniak et al .",
    "microlensing is most efficient at accounting for observed anomalies , in particular the preferred demagnification of the saddle point image , when stars comprise a small fraction ( 1530% ) of the surface mass density at the image radius ( schechter & wambsganss 2002 ) .",
    "if we can constrain a two - component model of the galaxy mass distribution , then we can predict the stellar surface mass fraction at the radii typically spanned by lensed images .",
    "thus , the predictions and requirements of the microlensing hypothesis may be tested .    because mass distributions have been directly constrained in only a small number of gravitational lenses ,",
    "it is worthwhile to consider statistical constraints on the lens galaxy population .",
    "such attempts have thus far been very limited .",
    "several analyses ( e.g. , rusin & ma 2001 ; evans & hunter 2002 ) have focused on the absence of central images in deep radio maps of gravitational lens systems , which has been invoked to rule out profiles that are much shallower than isothermal or have significant cores . keeton ( 2003 ) suggests that such constraints have been over - interpreted , since the magnification of the missing image is strongly dependent on the properties of the mass profile very close to the galaxy center .",
    "in addition , because mass distributions steeper than isothermal do not produce central images , any constraints based on the absence of these images are one - sided .",
    "the number and sizes of lens systems have also been used to investigate galaxy mass profiles in the context of cdm models ( keeton 2001 ) .",
    "it is shown that adiabatic compression ( e.g. , blumenthal et al .",
    "1986 ) yields nearly flat rotation curves for a range of initial halo concentrations and cooled baryon fractions ( see also kochanek & white 2001 and kochanek 2003 ) , but typical cdm halos ( e.g. , bullock et al .  2001 )",
    "appear to be too centrally concentrated to account for the data .",
    "the analysis , however , offers few quantitative results describing the mean mass profile and scatter , and therefore demands further study of two - component mass models .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a new technique to statistically constrain the mass profiles of early - type lens galaxies via aperture mass measurements .",
    "each lens must obey a strict relationship between the image radii and the projected masses they enclose .",
    "the set of mass - radius relations can be used to investigate the typical mass profile in a sample of lenses if we assume that early - type galaxies have a self - similar ( homologous ) structure .",
    "this means that the functional form ( shape ) of the mass distribution is the same from galaxy to galaxy , and is scaled by the properties of the light distribution .",
    "an underlying homology between mass and light is suggested by the existence of a tight fundamental plane relating optical and dynamical observables .",
    "in one popular interpretation of the fp ( e.g. , faber et al .  1987 ; van albada et al .",
    "1995 ) , early - type galaxies are structurally homologous , but the mass - to - light ratio has a luminosity dependence .",
    "gerhard et al .  ( 2001 ) use dynamical data to bolster this hypothesis , demonstrating that more luminous early - type galaxies have higher stellar mass - to - light ratios in their central regions .",
    "other analyses have cast doubt on the description of the fp in terms of strong homology and varying mass - to - light ratios ( e.g. , caon , capaccioli , & donofrio 1993 ; pahre et al .",
    "1998 ; bertin et al .",
    "1994 , 2002 ) , and instead suggest a weak homology in which structural parameters vary systematically with luminosity .",
    "however , because a strong homology is the simplest reasonable assumption , it is a good starting point for the statistical investigation of mass profiles in early - type galaxies .",
    "section 2 details the aperture mass - radius constraints offered by lensing . section 3 describes the lens sample and outlines our various assumptions .",
    "section 4 introduces our self - similar models and the associated methodology .",
    "section 5 presents our statistical constraints on the radial mass distribution in lenses .",
    "section 6 demonstrates how these constraints can be used for the interpretation of measured time delays and flux ratio anomalies among lensed images .",
    "section 7 discusses our findings in the context of recent astrophysical and cosmological results .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we assume a flat @xmath21 cosmology with @xmath22 for all calculations .",
    "the geometries of gravitational lens systems yield model - independent constraints on projected masses .",
    "consider , for example , a deflector with a circularly symmetric surface density distribution , and a source which sits directly behind it .",
    "the image will form on a ring of ( physical ) einstein radius @xmath23 , which is related to the aperture mass ( @xmath24 ) it encloses by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the critical surface density .",
    "angular diameter distances to the lens , to the source , and from the lens to the source are @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively . for this simple case ,",
    "the mass enclosed by the ring is determined by its radius alone , and is therefore independent of the shape of the mass profile .",
    "real lenses are more complicated .",
    "first , sources ( and their images ) are , in general , not symmetrically placed with respect to the mass distribution .",
    "this means that the geometry may be described by more than one characteristic radius .",
    "second , gravitational potentials are , in general , not circularly symmetric .",
    "the presence of a quadrupole , due to either external shear or ellipticity , effectively stretches the image plane along one axis and compresses it along a perpendicular axis , thereby confusing the interpretation of geometry in terms of mass .",
    "these issues are surmountable , however , allowing any lens geometry to yield model - independent relations between masses and radii .",
    "four - image lenses ( quads ) offer the best mass constraints , as the above complications are minimized .",
    "the images typically reside at similar radii , and their good angular coverage allows for the robust determination and removal of the quadrupole .",
    "just about any mass profile can reproduce the image positions and fluxes in a quad , but modeling demonstrates that there is a radius at which all models agree on the enclosed projected mass ( e.g. , cohn et al .",
    "2001 ; muoz et al .",
    "we have tested the generality of this claim using monte carlo simulations .",
    "first , we create fake four - image lenses from an elliptical mass distribution with some fixed radial profile residing in an external shear field of random orientation .",
    "we then model the image positions and fluxes using a broad range of mass profiles , tabulating the mass enclosed by a circular aperture as a function of radius for each best - fit model .",
    "we find that the suite of aperture mass curves @xmath30 cross at nearly the same radius ( @xmath23 ) , the value of which can be accurately estimated ( to @xmath31 ) from the critical radius of a model - fit singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) in an external shear field .",
    "this is true regardless of whether the mass distribution is spherical or elliptical .",
    "the enclosed , projected mass inside @xmath23 is then given by eq .",
    "( 1 ) , to an accuracy of @xmath32 .    two - image lenses ( doubles ) yield weaker mass constraints . if the potential is circularly symmetric , then the lens equation dictates a model - independent mass - radius relation : @xmath33 \\left ( \\frac{1}{r_1 + r_2 } \\right ) =   \\sigma_{cr } , \\ ] ] where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the radii of the images with respect to the galaxy center , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the projected masses they enclose . hence , doubles constrain a combination of two radii and two masses .",
    "note that in the limit of a ring ( @xmath38 ) , we recover eq .  ( 1 ) .",
    "the presence of a quadrupole smears the mass - radius relation for doubles , and the limited number of constraints means that its effects can not be removed in a model - independent manner . if the quadrupole is represented as an external shear , then the maximum fractional deviation from eq .",
    "( 2 ) is equal to the shear magnitude @xmath39 , and this occurs when the shear axis is parallel or perpendicular to the axis defined by the lensed images .",
    "averaging over orientations , the rms deviation is @xmath40 .",
    "we have confirmed this assertion using monte carlo simulations , in which fake doubles are produced from one mass profile and modeled using a range of mass profiles .",
    "while four - image lenses typically have quadrupoles which can be described by shear fields of amplitude @xmath41 ( e.g. , keeton , kochanek & seljak 1997 ; holder & schechter 2003 ) , we might expect doubles to have somewhat lower quadrupoles , on average , as they represent a greater fraction of the lensing cross section when the shear is small ( e.g. , keeton et al .",
    "1997 ; rusin & tegmark 2001 ; finch et al .",
    "consequently , deviations from eq .",
    "( 2 ) should generally be @xmath42 .",
    "we therefore employ eq .",
    "( 2 ) as a model - independent mass - radius relation for doubles , and set a @xmath43 tolerance for quadrupole effects . ;",
    "( e.g. , keeton et al .  1997 ) .",
    "second , such large external shears would have to be directly traced to nearby , cluster - scale perturbers , which are not observed in the relatively low - density environments of lens galaxies ( keeton , christlein & zabludoff 2000 ) . ]",
    "we begin with the sample of 28 early - type gravitational lens galaxies and bulges analyzed by rusin et al .",
    "note that this includes q2237 + 050 ( huchra et al .",
    "1985 ) , which is lensed entirely by the bulge of a spiral galaxy .",
    "twenty - two of the systems have measured lens redshifts ( @xmath44 ) , and 18 of these are in combination with a measured source redshift ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "( treu & koopmans 2003 ) for mg1549 + 3047 ( lehr et al .",
    "previously , for systems with no @xmath44 , the lens redshift had been estimated under the requirement that the galaxy fall on the fundamental plane ( kochanek et al .",
    "2000 ) . to make use of this technique",
    ", one must first estimate the stellar velocity dispersion , which necessitates an explicit assumption of a galaxy mass profile . since this paper",
    "is concerned with constraining mass models , it is prudent to exclude the six lenses without spectroscopic lens redshifts .",
    "the number of lenses used in the following analysis is therefore 22 .",
    "the systems are listed in table  1 .",
    "the important geometric properties of each lens system are derived from the radii of the lensed images .",

    "the uncertainties on these positions are typically @xmath46 milliarcseconds , which is negligible compared to the radii of even the closest lensed images in doubles ( @xmath47 arcsec ) . for quads and rings , the angular einstein radius @xmath48 is determined by fitting an sis plus external shear model to the lens data , and then converted to the physical radius @xmath49 .",
    "the einstein radius can typically be derived to @xmath501% precision , so its uncertainty is also negligible .",
    "the geometric properties of the lens sample are listed in table  1 .",
    "interpreting radii in terms of masses requires the critical surface density @xmath26 , which depends on source and galaxy redshifts through the angular diameter distances .",
    "recall that each lens galaxy in our sample has a measured redshift . if the source redshift has also been measured , then there is no uncertainty in @xmath26 , at least within the context of our standard cosmological assumptions .",
    "if the source redshift is not known , we derive the uncertainty in @xmath26 ( actually @xmath51 ) with monte carlo techniques .",
    "following rusin et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , we draw 10000 values from a gaussian distribution @xmath52 for the source redshift , keeping only trials with @xmath53 because virtually all known lensed sources lie within this range .",
    "we adopt the @xmath54 value of @xmath51 as the median , and the rms scatter around this value as the uncertainty in @xmath51 .",
    "the important photometric properties of each galaxy are the intermediate axis effective radius and luminosity .",
    "these quantities are derived from hst data obtained with the wfpc2 and nicmos cameras .",
    "the fitting methods are detailed by lehr et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , kochanek et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and rusin et al .",
    "the optical effective radius ( @xmath55 ; or @xmath56 in physical units ) is determined by fitting a de vaucouleurs profile to the galaxy in the filter with the highest signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "this quantity is then held fixed to determine the mean surface brightness within the effective radius ( @xmath57 ) in all filters @xmath58 .",
    "the total magnitude is then @xmath59 .",
    "the photometric properties of our sample are tabulated in rusin et al.(2003 ) .",
    "complications arise from the need to convert the observed galaxy magnitudes to some standard luminosity scale that accounts for @xmath60-corrections and luminosity evolution .",
    "as we shall see in  4 , only the magnitude offset @xmath61 is required for our analysis , since we can parameterize the homology model in terms of the present - day ( @xmath62 ) stellar mass - to - light ratio for an @xmath63 galaxy .",

    "specifically , we compare the observed magnitudes ( @xmath65 ) to models ( @xmath66 ) for the apparent magnitudes of an @xmath63 galaxy at the lens redshift , and then calculate the mean offset : @xmath67/(\\delta m_{obs , y})^2}{\\sum_y 1/(\\delta m_{obs , y})^2 } \\ .\\ ] ] we compute the model magnitudes by convolving spectral energy distributions from the gissel96 version of the bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) spectral evolution models with transmission curves for hst filters ( available from the technical archives of stsci , with zero - points from holtzman et al .",
    "all models are normalized to a fixed present - day characteristic magnitude of @xmath68 for early - type galaxies in the @xmath69 band ( e.g. , madgwick et al .",

    "the assumed metallicity is consistent with observations of early - type field galaxies at @xmath72 ( ferreras , charlot & silk 1999 ) , and the assumed formation redshift is consistent with a number of analyses which strongly favor old stellar populations ( mean star formation redshift @xmath73 ; e.g. , bernardi et al .",

    "this uncertainty is much larger than the measurement errors , since all of the 22 galaxies have excellent photometry .",
    "we therefore adopt a luminosity error of @xmath77 , or @xmath78 , for all lens galaxies .    estimating @xmath79 requires some understanding of luminosity evolution , which is implicitly included in the spectral models .",
    "for example , when normalized to a fixed @xmath80 at @xmath62 , a faster evolution rate ( lower @xmath81 ) would predict higher values of @xmath82 , and hence we would derive lower values of @xmath79 for each lens galaxy .",
    "if the true mean star formation redshift is @xmath83 , then our fiducial model of @xmath84 could greatly overestimate @xmath79 , especially for high redshift lenses ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "however , most studies of early - type field galaxies are inconsistent with the rapid luminosity evolution implied by @xmath83 .",
    "we note in passing that if the evolution rate is explicitly fit by our mass models (  4 ) , the scatter is minimized by @xmath86 , and increases for later formation redshifts .",
    "unfortunately , the resulting constraints on the evolution rate are very poor , as a number of other parameters are being fit .",
    "since this paper focuses on the structure of lens galaxies , we believe it is best to simply assume a reasonable mean star formation redshift of @xmath87 .",
    "we reiterate that our estimated uncertainties on @xmath79 are sufficient to account for the spread in evolution rates over the favored range of @xmath88 .",
    "finally , note that many of the quantities entering our analysis are correlated .",
    "for example , the total magnitude and the fraction of the light enclosed by the aperture radius @xmath89 both correlate with the effective radius @xmath90 .",
    "neither effect is very significant , because @xmath91 is typically quite small ( see rusin et al .",
    "2003 ) , but for completeness we take these correlations into account via monte carlo calculations .",
    "we draw 10000 trials from a gaussian distribution representing the effective radius ( mean @xmath92 , width @xmath93 ) , compute the derived quantities , and store them for later use .",
    "we use the 10000 sets of correlated parameters , plus the independent ( uncorrelated ) luminosity error of @xmath94 , to calculate the scatter in the quantities entering the fitting functions given below .",
    "the aperture mass - radius relation ( eq . 1 or 2 ) for a single lens tells us nothing about the mass profile . however , recall that the image splitting scale depends on the redshifts of both the lens galaxy ( @xmath44 ) and lensed source ( @xmath45 ) through the angular diameter distances in @xmath26 . for example , consider a spherical galaxy with a power - law mass density @xmath95 , and a corresponding surface density @xmath96 .",
    "if a source sits directly behind this galaxy , it will be lensed into a ring of einstein radius @xmath97^{1/(n-1 ) } r_0 $ ] .",
    "we could therefore imagine placing a fixed mass distribution at various @xmath44 , where it will lens sources at various @xmath45 .",
    "the resulting set of einstein radii @xmath23 and aperture masses @xmath24 would then allow us to trace out the radial mass profile of that galaxy .",
    "nature offers us an ensemble of gravitational lens systems with a wide range of lens ( @xmath98 ) and source ( @xmath99 ) redshifts , but the galaxy properties are far from uniform .",
    "the aperture mass - radius relations can , however , determine the typical ( or `` mean '' ) mass profile of the lens galaxy population if all galaxies can be placed on a common mass scale .",
    "this is most easily accomplished by postulating some self - similar ( homology ) model to relate the mass and light distributions of early - type galaxies .",
    "a given model allows projected masses @xmath30 to be predicted for each lens using the photometric parameters , which can then be compared to the mass - radius relations determined from the lensing geometries .",
    "the large range of image radii in our sample , spanning @xmath100 , gives us a long baseline for mapping the profile .",
    "we note , however , that the distribution is not uniformly populated , with most of the quads and rings probing the range @xmath101 .",
    "doubles help fill in the radial coverage : the inner images typically span @xmath102 , while the outer images span @xmath103 .",
    "we consider a physically - motivated two component ( luminous plus dark matter ) model for the mass distribution . because of the limited sample of lenses on which to test the model , we keep the number of parameters to a minimum .",
    "the component which traces the luminous matter is modeled by two parameters : the mean present - day ( @xmath62 ) stellar mass - to - light ratio @xmath104 ( in the rest frame @xmath69 band ) for an @xmath63 galaxy , and an exponent ( @xmath105 ) describing its dependence on the galaxy luminosity @xmath7 : @xmath106 . under the assumption of homology",

    "recall that for the de vaucouleurs profile , @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "note that our use of the intermediate axis effective radius , which is the geometric mean of the major and minor axes , allows us to accurately determine the fraction of the luminosity enclosed by a circular aperture , even when the surface brightness distribution is elliptical .",
    "we model the dark matter as a power - law mass distribution .",
    "n - body simulations predict halos in which the mass density follows a shallow power - law slope at small radius , and turns over to a steeper slope beyond some break radius ( e.g. , navarro , frenk & white 1997 , hereafter nfw ; moore et al .",
    "however , because the lensed image radii probe only the inner several kiloparsecs of the mass distribution , we believe that a power - law approximation for the dark matter halo is reasonable on this scale . we describe this component by two parameters : the projected mass fraction ( @xmath113 ) within @xmath114 , which is roughly the median scale of the einstein radii of our lens sample , and the logarithmic slope of the mass density profile ( @xmath115 , where @xmath116 ) . should be thought of as a `` local '' density slope . in reality ,",

    "the homology scheme effectively places all galaxies on a common mass scale by normalizing the aperture masses @xmath30 by @xmath122 , and the aperture radii @xmath89 by @xmath90 .",
    "if a strict homology holds , then all galaxy aperture masses and radii should reside on a curve in the space of @xmath123 versus @xmath124 .",
    "modeling , dynamical and statistical studies of gravitational lens galaxies often make use of a single - component mass distribution with a scale - free radial profile . while simplistic , this model allows one to explore much of the lensing phenomenology related to mass concentration , and provides a standard for comparing profile constraints from different lens systems .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to consider the scale - free limit of our homology model . by taking @xmath125 and @xmath126 ( such that @xmath127 )",

    "we set @xmath138 for quads and rings , and @xmath139 for systems with a measured @xmath45 .",
    "finally , we note that the above procedures have been tested using monte carlo simulations , and we find that the input mass profiles can be successfully recovered .    following optimization ,",
    "we uniformly rescale the estimated errors by setting @xmath133 so that the best - fit model has @xmath140 , the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "this does not alter the optimized parameters , but does allow us to relate the uncertainties to the observed scatter in the homology model .",
    "moreover , it preserves the relative weighting among the data points , which naturally gives more weight to quads and rings , and those systems with a measured @xmath45 .",
    "rescaling is particularly important because our model is undoubtedly a simplistic representation of galaxy mass distributions .",
    "hence , the @xmath141 is likely to be dominated by unmodeled complexity ( i.e. , deviations from self - similarity ) in the galaxy population , rather than by observational errors .",

    "there are well - defined regions allowed by the data , but substantial degeneracy between parameters .",
    "this is expected because the mass - radius relations constrain the combined ( luminous plus dark matter ) radial mass distribution .",

    "this degeneracy is reflected in the @xmath153 panel of fig .  1",
    ". the mass - radius relations also prefer some overall shape , or concentration , for the combined profile . to achieve a given mass concentration",
    ", we can place more of the mass in the stellar component if the cdm slope is shallower , and less if the cdm slope is steeper .",
    "these degeneracies ( @xmath154 , @xmath155 ) are also clearly seen in fig .  1 .",
    "the slope @xmath105 , which describes the increase in stellar mass - to - light ratio with luminosity , is uncorrelated with the other three parameters ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "optimizing over the other parameters , we find @xmath156 at @xmath157 confidence ( @xmath158 ) , and @xmath159 at @xmath160 confidence ( @xmath161 ) .",
    "this is the first constraint on @xmath105 from strong lensing .",
    "our analysis robustly detects the presence of dark matter in the form of a mass component that is more spatially extended than the light .",
    "dark matter contributes several tens of percent to the projected mass inside @xmath162 .",
    "this result can be quantified in a variety of ways , for different assumptions :    * a model in which mass traces light ( @xmath163 ) has @xmath164 with respect to the overall best fit , and is therefore rejected at @xmath3 confidence .",
    "it is too centrally concentrated to account for the ensemble of aperture mass - radius relations .",
    "we note in passing that such a model would require @xmath165 in the rest frame @xmath69 band , only slightly higher than the value of @xmath166 determined by gerhard et al .",

    "the allowed range is @xmath176 at @xmath157 confidence , and @xmath177 at @xmath160 confidence .",
    "because there are significant degeneracies between parameters , we can not place a tight constraint on the slope of the dark matter component : @xmath178 at 68% confidence , with an upper bound of @xmath179 at 95% confidence .",
    "however , the favored models have dark and luminous components which sum to produce very similar mass profiles over the radial range probed by the lensed images .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .  2 , which shows the projected mass @xmath30 versus @xmath89 for all models with @xmath180 in the @xmath155 plane .",
    "we see that the mass profile closely tracks a pure isothermal ( @xmath181 ) model .    in the scale - free limit ( @xmath125 and @xmath182 ,",
    "see  4 ) , we find @xmath183 at 68% confidence , consistent with isothermal or slightly steeper profiles .",
    "the 95% range is @xmath184 .",

    "doubles are more difficult to depict , as they constrain a combination of two masses and radii .",

    "the resulting values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 in the context of the best - fit profile are plotted for each double in fig .",
    "while the locations of the points obviously depend on the assumed model , the best - fit profile will minimize their scatter about the model curve . in this way we see that doubles",
    "also help map the mass profile .",
    "the radial coverage offered by the current lens sample is not uniform ( fig .",
    "quad and ring systems , which provide the strongest mass constraints , mostly lie in the range @xmath101 .",
    "there are two notable outliers : q2237 + 030 ( huchra et al .",
    "1985 ) , which probes the smallest radial scale ( @xmath187 ) , and mg2016 + 112 ( lawrence et al .  1984 ) , which probes the largest radial scale ( @xmath188 ) .",
    "because these lenses constrain the extremes of the density profile , it is important to address how much they affect our fits . we find that dropping either of the systems does not alter the primary conclusions that the total mass profile is nearly isothermal , or that @xmath189 is favored .",
    "some of the other constraints are slightly affected , and this can be understood based on the unique characteristics of each lens .",
    "first , mg2016 + 112 probes a scale much larger than the effective radius , and its aperture mass will be dominated by dark matter in most models .",
    "this system is therefore important for constraining the properties of the cdm component .",
    "removing it weakens the exclusion of models in which mass traces light to about @xmath160 confidence , and significantly weakens the upper limit on @xmath115 in the limit @xmath190 .",
    "profile constraints in the scale - free limit ( @xmath126 ) , however , are not significantly changed .",
    "second , q2237 + 030 probes a scale much smaller than the effective radius , and its aperture mass will be dominated by luminous matter in most models .",
    "consequently , this system contributes minimally to constraints on the cdm component . dropping it has little effect on any of the model parameters , even those related to the stellar mass .",
    "finally , it is interesting to dissect the distribution of scatter about the best - fit homology model . despite comprising only 7 of the 22 systems , doubles account for 56% of the @xmath141 .",
    "the additional scatter for doubles is greater than we would expect from the quadrupole smearing , and may indicate some unmodeled effect which we do not presently understand . dropping all doubles would significantly improve the fit ( @xmath191 for @xmath192 , prior to rescaling ) and tighten the resulting parameter constraints , but would not alter the major conclusions .",
    "for example , a model in which mass traces light would be rejected more strongly ( @xmath193 ) , and constraints on the density slope in the scale - free limit would be @xmath194 ( 68% c.l . ) .",
    "we also note that a pair of lenses are particularly strong contributors to the scatter . the two - image system q0142100 ( surdej et al .",
    "1987 ) is the farthest outlier , just as it is in our fp analysis ( rusin et al .",
    "2003 ) , and accounts for almost @xmath195 of the @xmath141 . because the galaxy appears to be much brighter than expected , it greatly over - predicts aperture masses . the ring system mg1131 + 0456 ( hewitt et al .  1988 ) is the second largest contributor to the @xmath141 , accounting for @xmath196 of its value , despite being assigned a rather large fit tolerance due to its estimated source redshift .",
    "the lens galaxy can be brought into better agreement with the other galaxies if the lensed source is at a substantially higher redshift than the assumed median of @xmath197 .",
    "while our sample is too small to reasonably remove these two outliers , doing so would improve the fit ( @xmath198 for @xmath199 , prior to rescaling ) but not affect the major conclusions .",
    "for example , a model in which mass traces light would be rejected somewhat more strongly ( @xmath200 ) , and constraints on the density slope in the scale - free limit would be @xmath201 ( 68% c.l . ) .",
    "the time delays between gravitationally lensed images depend on a combination of the hubble constant and the mass distribution of the lensing galaxy .",
    "the hubble constant inferred from a measured time delay can be approximated as @xmath202 where @xmath203 is the mean scaled surface mass density in the annulus defined by the radii of the lensed images , @xmath204 is the logarithmic slope of the density ( @xmath205 ) within the annulus , and the constants @xmath206 and @xmath69 incorporate the lensing geometry , the redshifts , and the measured delay ( kochanek 2002 ) .",
    "the @xmath206 term is the most important , and the @xmath69 term just contributes a small ( @xmath5010% ) correction .",
    "kochanek ( 2002 , 2003 ) investigates `` simple '' time delay lenses which are dominated by a single galaxy with a precisely determined centroid relative to the images . two limiting cases of the mass distribution are considered : models in which mass traces light yield @xmath207 , while isothermal models yield @xmath208 .",
    "a number of recent results from a broader ( perhaps less well understood ) sample of lenses fall within the range @xmath209 ( burud et al.2002a , 2002b ; fassnacht et al .  2002 ; treu & koopmans 2002b ; winn et al .",
    "2002 ) if isothermality is assumed .",
    "in fact , the only lens to yield @xmath20 for an isothermal model is b0218 + 357 ( biggs et al .  1999 ) , but the result is currently dominated by systematics related to the poorly constrained galaxy position .",
    "one can therefore make the case that estimates of the hubble constant from strong lensing are in broad agreement , but are systematically lower than the values favored by both the hst key project ( freedman et al .",
    "2001 ) and the recent wmap results ( spergel et al .  2003 ) .",
    "because kochanek ( 2002 , 2003 ) shows that nearly constant mass - to - light ratio models are necessary to reconcile time delay measurements with @xmath20 , this would seem to imply that lens galaxies have no extended dark matter component , in contradiction to virtually every other observational test .",
    "we can now explore this intriguing problem in the context of our constraints on self - similar galaxy models .",
    "of the five lenses considered by kochanek ( 2002 ) , three are drawn from our sample .",
    "the two exceptions are b1600 + 434 ( jackson et al .  1995 ) , which has a late - type lens galaxy ( koopmans , de bruyn & jackson 1998 ) and is therefore not described by our models , and rxj0911 + 0551 ( bade et al.1997 ) , which has a significant cluster perturbation complicating interpretation of the image radii . because pg1115 + 080 ( weymann et al.1980 ) has been explored in detail by treu & koopmans ( 2002b ) , we limit our demonstration to a pair of two - image lenses , sbs1520 + 530 ( chavushyan et al .",

    "the values of @xmath217 come out slightly higher than those obtained by kochanek ( 2002 ) for an isothermal profile , because our favored profiles are slightly steeper than @xmath2 .",

    "2001 ) and wmap data ( @xmath219 ; spergel et al .  2003 ) , but the discrepancy is only about @xmath220 in our analysis .      simple , smooth models for the galaxy mass distribution have great difficulty reproducing the observed flux ratios in four - image lenses ( e.g. , dalal & kochanek 2002 ; metcalf & zhao 2002 ; chiba 2002 ; keeton et al .",
    "moreover , flux ratio measurements in both the radio and optical appear to violate fundamental symmetry arguments which predict nearly equal magnifications for merging image pairs .",
    "such flux ratio `` anomalies '' are almost certainly due to small - scale structure in the gravitational potential ( kochanek & dalal 2003 ) , which can significantly perturb magnifications ( e.g. , mao & schneider 1998 ) while leaving the image positions virtually unaltered .",
    "there is a debate regarding the identification of the perturbers .",

    "1999a ) predict significant substructure ( with mass scale @xmath221 ) in galaxy halos , and dalal & kochanek ( 2002 ) demonstrate that the substructure mass fraction required to account for radio flux ratio anomalies is in line with @xmath222-body results .",
    "stars are another source of substructure in the gravitational potential ( witt et al .",

    "since we require models with an extended dark matter component , lower values of @xmath224 are favored at @xmath130 due to the fact that the surface brightness of the galaxy has already decreased substantially at this radius , while the dark matter density has not . assuming that each model ( @xmath212,@xmath213 ) has a likelihood @xmath225 , constraints on @xmath224 can be determined from a bayesian analysis .",

    "we find @xmath183 ( 68% c.l . ) , consistent with isothermal or slightly steeper profiles .",
    "two - component models imply that the dark matter mass fraction is not very high : @xmath227 for an @xmath4 halo ( nfw 1997 ) , or @xmath228 for a steeper @xmath173 halo ( moore et al .",

    "even so , the need for an extended dark matter component in the inner regions of the galaxies is significant , as a model in which mass traces light is ruled out at @xmath3 confidence .",
    "these are the best statistical constraints yet obtained on the typical radial mass profile in gravitational lens galaxies , and they add to evidence that the mass distribution is nearly isothermal on the scale of a few effective radii .    one might expect lenses to be a biased sample of early - type galaxies , because deflectors with more centrally - concentrated profiles have larger lensing cross sections per unit mass . consequently ,",
    "if the galaxy population exhibits a range of profiles , then lensing would tend to select galaxies with steeper mass distributions .",
    "note , however , that profile constraints for the lens galaxy population are consistent with the nearly isothermal profiles favored by dynamical and x - ray studies of local ellipticals , which are not selected on the basis of mass concentration .",
    "this would appear to strengthen the argument that early - type galaxies do not exhibit much structural variety , and therefore , that gravitational lenses are typical members of this galaxy population .",

    "borriello et al.(2003 ) also suggest that a cuspy dark matter halo can contribute little to the mass inside a few effective radii , if early - type galaxies are to occupy a tight fundamental plane .",
    "we can compare these measurements to the predictions of the cdm model .",
    "assuming an nfw halo profile , a cooled baryon fraction of @xmath230 ( from the local census of baryons by fukugita , hogan & peebles 1998 ) , and a typical initial halo concentration ( @xmath231 ; bullock et al .",

    "the derived @xmath15 is still systematically lower than recent results ( freedman et al .",
    "2001 ; spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) , although the discrepancy is only about @xmath220 in our analysis , as the statistical uncertainties in the mass profile are still significant .",
    "second , we have estimated the fraction of the surface mass density in the form of stars ( @xmath224 ) at the radii of lensed images . for images at @xmath162 ,",
    "our models favor @xmath226 ( 68% c.l . ) .",
    "this is consistent with the values at which stellar microlensing can reproduce the observed flux ratio anomalies , in particular the tendency for saddle - point images to be more strongly perturbed than minima ( schechter & wambsganss 2002 ) .    much more work is needed to fully understand the structure of early - type galaxies , and the implications for galaxy formation theories . because of its unique advantages , gravitational lensing is certain to contribute significantly to this goal .",
    "improved statistical tests to constrain the mass profiles of early - type galaxies require larger samples of lenses . particularly important",
    "is the addition of new quad and ring systems which probe the mass distribution on small ( @xmath247 ) and large ( @xmath248 ) scales , and therefore fill in the tails of our radial coverage .",
    "as always , the key to turning recently discovered systems into useful astrophysical tools is the acquisition of high - quality hst photometry and ground - based spectroscopy .",
    "expanded samples could allow us to replace our simplistic power - law model for the dark matter halo with more realistic profiles , and consider structural dependencies on luminosity or color . in this way we may be able to properly investigate sources of scatter in our homology model , and perhaps quantify or constrain the structural diversity of the early - type galaxy population . with regard to lensing determinations of the hubble constant ,",
    "it is vital to increase the number of lenses that have both direct profile constraints and well - determined time delays .",
    "currently there is only one such system ( pg1115 + 080 ; schechter et al .",
    "1997 ; treu & koopmans 2002b ) .",
    "programs are now underway to both measure more time delays , and obtain profile constraints on current systems by measuring stellar velocity dispersions or mapping extended emission from the lensed host galaxies .",
    "such observations should greatly illuminate current discrepancies related to time delays and the hubble constant , and , more generally , improve our understanding of the mass distribution in early - type galaxies .",
