    "t parallel to the @xmath4 planes , further anomalies are observed at @xmath9115  k and @xmath9160  k. in particular , for @xmath130 these two temperatures border a dip - like anomaly , and for the perpendicular direction @xmath133 a hump . in both cases",
    "the anomalies are suppressed by a magnetic field of the order of @xmath134  t and at 7  t the susceptibility  is isotropic ( cf .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) .",
    "we mention that for @xmath117  t applied parallel to [ 100 ] no anomalies are observed ; however , they can be induced at fields of @xmath135  t and then disappear again at 7  t. therefore , we assume that below @xmath58 spins are either parallel to [ 110 ] or [ 110 ] and the observed transitions as a function of field are due to a spin flop .",
    "the relatively low field scale indicates an in - plane spin wave gap of the order of 0.5  mev .",
    "this gap energy is much smaller than in @xmath51  where the in - plane gap was associated with the dzyaloshinsky ",
    "moriya  spin canting , which might confirm that the spin canting in @xmath5  is indeed small .",
    "@xcite for comparison , in @xmath51  the spin flop field amounts to 10 - 15  t , and in tetragonal @xmath136  with perfectly coplanar spin structure it is only 0.7  t.  @xcite    interestingly , the two critical temperatures of 115  k and 160  k are nearly identical with the structural transition temperatures , as observed by xrd and nd , respectively ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "considering our diffraction data alone , possible interpretations are ( i ) that we have indeed observed two distinct transitions , ( ii ) that surface effects are important ( xrd ) , ( iii ) that a inhomogeneous distribution of the oxygen content exists .",
    "the fact that both anomalies show up in the macroscopic susceptibility  indicates that they involve large volume fractions , making surface effects less likely . in the case of an inhomogeneous oxygen distribution",
    "we would expect one broad transition rather than two relatively sharp ones . on the other hand , for nd , probing the entire crystal , the transition is in fact relatively broad , while for xrd , probing a relatively small area of the sample , the transition is sharp .",
    "hence , diffraction data are not inconsistent with an inhomogeneous oxygen distribution . in this case",
    "the anomaly at 115  k might correspond to the @xmath58 of the hole rich surface region and the anomaly at 160  k the @xmath58 of the bulk , which has a slightly lower average hole concentration . on the other hand , the susceptibility  data in fig .",
    "[ fig11](a ) are difficult to understand in terms of a sequence of two transitions of the same kind differing only in their critical temperatures , since at @xmath9160  k @xmath116 first decreases and then again increases at @xmath9115  k. further experiments are needed to clarify the origin of this intriguing sequence of transitions .",
    "now let us turn to @xmath137 of @xmath17 , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] . in a field of @xmath117",
    "t the onset of superconductivity is observed at @xmath925  k for @xmath131 and at @xmath915  k for @xmath138 . at a field of 7",
    "t applied @xmath139 superconductivity is suppressed completely . above @xmath8",
    "the data look similar to that of @xmath16  in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "however , no anomaly is observed at the transition to short - range antiferromagnetic order at @xmath140  k. interestingly , the increase of @xmath116 at high temperatures is steeper than for the ca - doped sample .",
    "this is a clear indication for a shift of the high temperature maximum of the heisenberg spin susceptibility @xmath141 to lower temperatures , which is consistent with the fact that the hole content in @xmath17  is larger and therefore the spin stiffness is smaller than in @xmath16 .",
    "@xcite      the two major results in this study are ( i ) the similarity between the thermal evolution of the orthorhombic distortion and antiferromagnetic order for short as well as long - range ordered samples , and ( ii ) the fact that the antiferromagnetic correlations are commensurate . for a proper interpretation one has to consider the hole concentration , which is known to strongly change the electronic ground state of high - temperature superconductors .",
    "@xcite as mentioned in the introduction , we have estimated the degree of hole doping in our crystals from their optical conductivity in ref .  .",
    "both crystals show considerable optical weight at low wave numbers , indicating a significant concentration of holes .",
    "in fact , when compared to optical data on @xmath3 , the hole content appears to be close to the nominal value @xmath19 , which suggests that the oxygen content @xmath142 in our crystals is close to zero .",
    "@xcite good agreement is also found with optical data in ref .  .",
    "in particular , the room temperature optical data of our @xmath16  crystal grown at 1  atm @xmath143 are nearly identical to that of a grown - in - air @xmath144crystal .  @xcite corresponding data for our @xmath17crystal grown at 11  atm indicate a higher hole concentration , comparable to @xmath144  annealed at 20 - 100  atm .",
    "@xcite according to ref .",
    ", @xmath144  is not superconducting when grown in air nor after annealing at 20 atm @xmath145 , while annealing at 100 atm results in a @xmath8 of 13  k in the resistivity .",
    "the presence of weak superconductivity in our sr - doped crystal and its absence in the ca - doped one is compatible with this , and shows that the sr - doped crystal is just on the borderline to the superconducting phase .",
    "if we assume that the hole contents in the crystals are close to the nominal values , then the relatively high nel temperature in @xmath16  and onset temperature for short - range order in @xmath17  are surprising , when compared to @xmath3 .",
    "however , in the bilayer system @xmath146  long - range order is suppressed at a higher hole content and spin - glass transition temperatures are higher than in @xmath3 , as well .",
    "@xcite this indicates that in bilayer systems antiferromagnetic order in general is more stable , which is due to the relatively strong coupling between the @xmath4 planes of a bilayer .",
    "@xcite in the case of @xmath147 it seems , however , that additional degrees of freedom may play a vital role , as will be discussed in the next paragraphs .",
    "the intriguing similarity between the temperature dependence of the magnetic bragg peak and the orthorhombic superlattice peak fuels the idea of a significant magneto - elastic coupling .",
    "in particular , we expect that the magnetic inter - bilayer coupling depends on the orthorhombic strain . in the tetragonal high - temperature phase the magnetic inter - bilayer coupling is strongly frustrated , because of the centro symmetric arrangement of spins in adjacent bilayers ( cf .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the orthorhombic distortion at low temperature lifts the frustration , thereby triggering 3d antiferromagnetic order .",
    "a similar situation exists in the single layer compounds @xmath51  and @xmath136 .",
    "while @xmath51  becomes orthorhombic below 525  k and orders antiferromagnetically at @xmath148  k , @xmath136  with @xmath149  k stays tetragonal .",
    "@xcite it is believed that the orthorhombic strain in @xmath51  is one reason for the higher nel temperature , since it lifts the frustration of the interlayer coupling .",
    "@xcite we mention that early @xmath150sr results on @xmath5  and @xmath151  indicate nel temperatures higher than 250  k for the undoped system .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , in ref .",
    "the structural transition temperature in a @xmath5  powder sample was determined to be @xmath9175  k. this means that 3d magnetic order can exist in the tetragonal high temperature phase .",
    "@xcite however , in our hole doped @xmath16  crystal , where @xmath58 is considerably reduced from its maximum value , the structural transition seems to be essential for the stabilization of 3d antiferromagnetic order .    in the case of the @xmath17  crystal",
    "the magneto - elastic coupling seems to still be active .",
    "this conclusion is based on a similar temperature dependence for the peak intensity and correlation length of the structural distortion and antiferromagnetic correlations ( cf .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "since in ref .",
    "nearly identical results were found for a @xmath10  crystal , we assume that this behavior is intrinsic for samples grown at low oxygen pressure , which are relatively close to the superconducting phase , but not yet good superconductors",
    ". however , one has to mention that while neutron diffraction experiments on @xmath10  indicate short - range magnetic order below @xmath152  k , muon spin rotation measurements find static order only below 10  k.  @xcite this shows that for @xmath153 the magnetic correlations are not yet truly static . in this respect both @xmath154  crystals ( this work and ref .  )",
    "qualitatively show a similar behavior as @xmath3  in the spin - glass phase .",
    "@xcite however , there are major differences which we believe signal a significant magneto - elastic coupling",
    ". first , the  elastic \" magnetic intensities we observe in @xmath17  below the structural transition at @xmath140  k are much larger than in @xmath3  at a comparable hole doping close to the metal insulator transition .",
    "@xcite the onset temperature is much higher and seems to correlate with the structural transition .",
    "moreover , in @xmath17  magnetic correlations are commensurate , while they are incommensurate in @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite    since in @xmath16  the inter - bilayer exchange seems to couple very clearly to the orthorhombic lattice distortion , it is reasonable to assume that this coupling is at least one reason why in @xmath17  the freezing of the short - range magnetic order , as observed by neutron diffraction , reflects the temperature dependence of the structural distortion .",
    "in contrast , in @xmath3  it is believed that the spin freezing occurs upon the localization of the holes at low temperatures .",
    "@xcite it is very likely that hole localization is relevant in @xmath17 , also .",
    "but whether the structural transition into the orthorhombic phase expedites the hole localization , is unclear . in ref .",
    "it is argued that both structural as well as magnetic disorder follows from the localization of holes .",
    "however , the results on @xmath16  seem to show quite clearly that it is the orthorhombic structure which stabilizes the antiferromagnetic order . therefore , we assume that the coupling of the lattice to charge degrees of freedom is not responsible for the structural disorder observed in @xmath17 .",
    "spin freezing , on the contrary , not only is coupled to charge localization  as is the case in @xmath3   but also to the short - range lattice distortions .",
    "the electronic disorder , possibly induced or enhanced by structural disorder , might be responsible for the absence of incommensurate magnetic correlations at low temperatures .",
    "as is well known , structural disorder in this bilayer system is caused by the mixed occupation of the metal sites m(1 ) and m(2 ) , the doping with sr and ca as well as by interstitial oxygen o(3 ) and defects in the oxygen matrix ( cf .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "structural and magnetic properties of the bilayer cuprates @xmath16and @xmath17  were studied by means of neutron and x - ray scattering as well as static susceptibility  measurements .",
    "we observe an intimate connection between antiferromagnetic order and the structural lattice distortion , which we explain in terms of an orthorhombic strain - induced magnetic inter - bilayer coupling . while in the ca - doped crystal structural distortions and the cu spins are long - range ordered , the sr - doped crystal exhibits short - range order as well as weak superconductivity . in both crystals antiferromagnetic correlations are commensurate , i.e.",
    ", no direct evidence for incommensurate spin stripes is found .",
    "however , in @xmath16  the temperature dependence of the magnetic diffuse scattering as well as the static susceptibility indicate the presence of a spin - glass phase . in @xmath3",
    "this type of phase was shown to exhibit a short - range spin stripe order .",
    "@xcite the reasons for the absence of incommensurate spin correlations in particular in @xmath17are not understood , but might result from an inhomogeneity of the charge and spin density , possibly induced by the short - range ordered structural distortions in the orthorhombic phase ."
