    "science is about generalization , and generalization requires that conclusions obtained in the laboratory be transported and applied elsewhere , in an environment that differs in many aspects from that of the laboratory .    clearly , if the target environment is arbitrary , or drastically different from the study environment nothing can be transferred and scientific progress will come to a standstill .",
    "however , the fact that most studies are conducted with the intention of applying the results elsewhere means that we usually deem the target environment sufficiently similar to the study environment to justify the transport of experimental results or their ramifications .",
    "remarkably , the conditions that permit such transport have not received systematic formal treatment . in statistical practice ,",
    "problems related to combining and generalizing from diverse studies are handled by methods of meta analysis ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , or hierarchical models ( @xcite ) , in which results of diverse studies are pooled together by standard statistical procedures ( e.g. , inverse - variance reweighting in meta - analysis , partial pooling in hierarchical modeling ) and rarely make explicit distinction between experimental and observational regimes ; performance is evaluated primarily by simulation .    to supplement these methodologies ,",
    "our paper provides theoretical guidance in the form of limits on what can be achieved in practice , what problems are likely to be encountered when populations differ significantly from each other , what population differences can be circumvented by clever design and what differences constitute theoretical impediments , prohibiting generalization by any means whatsoever .    on the theoretical front ,",
    "the standard literature on this topic , falling under rubrics such as `` external validity '' ( @xcite ) , `` heterogeneity '' ( @xcite ) , `` quasi - experiments '' ( @xcite , chapter  3 ; @xcite ) , ] consists primarily of `` threats , '' namely , explanations of what may go wrong when we try to transport results from one study to another while ignoring their differences .",
    "rarely do we find an analysis of `` licensing assumptions , '' namely , formal conditions under which the transport of results across differing environments or populations is licensed from first principles .",
    "the reasons for this asymmetry are several .",
    "first , threats are safer to cite than assumptions .",
    "he who cites `` threats '' appears prudent , cautious and thoughtful , whereas he who seeks licensing assumptions risks suspicions of attempting to endorse those assumptions .",
    "second , assumptions are self - destructive in their honesty .",
    "the more explicit the assumption , the more criticism it invites , for it tends to trigger a richer space of alternative scenarios in which the assumption may fail .",
    "researchers prefer therefore to declare threats in public and make assumptions in private .",
    "third , whereas threats can be communicated in plain english , supported by anecdotal pointers to familiar experiences , assumptions require a formal language within which the notion `` environment '' ( or `` population '' ) is given precise characterization , and differences among environments can be encoded and analyzed .",
    "the advent of causal diagrams ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) together with models of interventions ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and counterfactuals ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) provides such a language and renders the formalization of transportability possible .",
    "armed with this language , this paper departs from the tradition of communicating `` threats '' and embarks instead on the task of formulating `` licenses to transport , '' namely , assumptions that , if they held true , would permit us to transport results across studies .",
    "in addition , the paper uses the inferential machinery of the do - calculus ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) to derive algorithms for deciding whether transportability is feasible and how experimental and observational findings can be combined to yield unbiased estimates of causal effects in the target population .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec2a ] , we review the foundations of structural equations modeling ( sem ) , the question of identifiability and the do - calculus that emerges from these foundations .",
    "( this section can be skipped by readers familiar with these concepts and tools . ) in section  [ sec2 ] , we motivate the question of transportability through simple examples , and illustrate how the solution depends on the causal story behind the problem . in section  [ sec3 ] , we formally define the notion of transportability and reduce it to a problem of symbolic transformations in do - calculus . in section  [ sec4 ] , we provide a graphical criterion for deciding transportability and estimating transported causal effects .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec8 ] with brief discussions of related problems of external validity , these include statistical transportability , and meta - analysis .",
    "the tools presented in this paper were developed in the context of nonparametric structural equations models ( sem ) , which is one among several approaches to causal inference , and goes back to ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "other approaches include , for example , potential - outcomes ( @xcite ) , structured tree graphs ( @xcite ) , decision analytic ( @xcite ) , causal bayesian networks ( @xcite ; @xcite , chapter  1 ; @xcite ) , and settable systems ( @xcite ) .",
    "we will first describe the generic features common to all such approaches , and then summarize how these features are represented in sem .      from a logical viewpoint ,",
    "causal analysis relies on causal assumptions that can not be deduced from ( nonexperimental ) data .",
    "thus , every approach to causal inference must provide a systematic way of encoding , testing and combining these assumptions with data .",
    "accordingly , we view causal modeling as an inference engine that takes three inputs and produces three outputs .",
    "the inputs are :    1 .   a set @xmath0 of qualitative causal _ assumptions _ which the investigator is prepared to defend on scientific grounds , and a model @xmath1 that encodes these assumptions mathematically .",
    "( in sem , @xmath1 takes the form of a diagram or a set of unspecified functions .",
    "a typical assumption is that no direct effect exists between a pair of variables ( known as exclusion restriction ) , or that an omitted factor , represented by an error term , is independent of other such factors observed or unobserved , known as well as unknown .",

    "the absence of a variable from the right - hand side of an equation encodes the assumption that nature ignores that variable in the process of determining the value of the output variable .",
    "for example , the absence of variable @xmath9 from the arguments of @xmath31 conveys the empirical claim that variations in @xmath9 will leave y unchanged , as long as variables @xmath30 and @xmath3 remain constant .",

    "this feature of invariance permits us to derive powerful claims about causal effects and counterfactuals , even in nonparametric models , where all functions and distributions remain unknown .",
    "this is done through a mathematical operator called @xmath35 , which simulates physical interventions by deleting certain functions from the model , replacing them with a constant @xmath36 , while keeping the rest of the model unchanged ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "for example , to emulate an intervention @xmath37 that sets @xmath3 to a constant @xmath38 in model @xmath6 of figure  [ figure2-r355](a ) , the equation for @xmath39 in equation ( [ eq5a ] ) is replaced by @xmath40 , and we obtain a new model , @xmath41 , @xmath42 the graphical description of which is shown in figure  [ figure2-r355](b ) .    the joint distribution associated with this modified model , denoted @xmath43 describes the post - intervention distribution of variables @xmath4 and @xmath9 ( also called `` controlled '' or `` experimental '' distribution ) , to be distinguished from the preintervention distribution , @xmath44 , associated with the original model of equation ( [ eq5a ] ) . for example , if @xmath3 represents a treatment variable , @xmath4 a response variable , and @xmath9 some covariate that affects the amount of treatment received , then the distribution @xmath43 gives the proportion of individuals that would attain response level @xmath45 and covariate level @xmath46 under the hypothetical situation in which treatment @xmath47 is administered uniformly to the population . can be interpreted as the joint probability of @xmath48 under a randomized experiment among units receiving treatment level @xmath49 .",

    "( see @xcite , chapter  7 ) , but will not be needed for the discussions in this paper . ]      a central question in causal analysis is the question of _ identification _ of causal queries ( e.g. , the effect of intervention @xmath20 ) from a combination of data and a partially specified model , for example , when only the graph is given and neither the functions @xmath21 nor the distribution of @xmath16 . in",

    "see discussion following example  [ ex2 ] . ]",
    "our first task in this paper will be to explicate the assumptions that renders this extrapolation valid .",
    "we ask , for example , what must we assume about other confounding variables beside age , both latent and observed , for equation ( [ eq1 ] ) to be valid , or , would the same transport formula hold if @xmath9 was not age , but some proxy for age , say , language proficiency .",
    "more intricate yet , what if @xmath9 stood for an exposure - dependent variable , say hyper - tension level , that stands between @xmath3 and @xmath4 ?",

    "the inequality @xmath103 in this example may reflect either age difference or differences in the way that @xmath9 correlates with age .",
    "if the two cities enjoy identical age distributions and nyc residents acquire linguistic skills at a younger age , then since @xmath9 has no effect whatsoever on @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the inequality @xmath103 can be ignored and , intuitively , the proper transport formula would be @xmath104 if , on the other hand , the conditional probabilities @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the same in both cities , and the inequality @xmath103 reflects genuine age differences , equation ( [ eq2 ] ) is no longer valid , since the age difference may be a critical factor in determining how people react to @xmath3 .",
    "we see , therefore , that the choice of the proper transport formula depends on the causal context in which population differences are embedded .",
    "this example also demonstrates why the invariance of @xmath9-specific causal effects should not be taken for granted .",
    "while justified in example  [ ex1 ] , with @xmath9 = age , it fails in example  [ ex2 ] , in which @xmath9 was equated with `` language skills . ''",
    "indeed , using figure  [ fig1](b ) for guidance , the @xmath9-specific effect of @xmath3 on @xmath4 in nyc is given by @xmath107 thus , if the two populations differ in the relation between age and skill , that is , @xmath108 the skill - specific causal effect would differ as well .",
    "the intuition is clear .",
    "a nyc person at skill level @xmath46 is likely to be in a totally different age group from his skill - equals in los angeles and , since it is age , not skill that shapes the way individuals respond to treatment , it is only reasonable that los angeles residents would respond differently to treatment than their nyc counterparts at the very same skill level .",
    "the essential difference between examples [ ex1 ] and [ ex2 ] is that age is normally taken to be an exogenous variable ( not assigned by other factors in the model ) while skills may be indicative of earlier factors ( age , education , ethnicity ) capable of modifying the causal effect .",
    "therefore , conditional on skill , the effect may be different in the two populations .",

    "can we , based on information given , estimate the average ( or @xmath102-specific ) causal effect in the target population of nyc ?    here , equation ( [ eq1 ] ) is wrong because the overall causal effect ( in both la and nyc ) is no longer a simple average of the @xmath102-specific causal effects .",

    "thus , instead of considering experimental and observational studies conducted at two different locations , we consider two such studies taking place at the same location , but at different times . in the first study , we measure @xmath111 and discover that @xmath9 is a good surrogate , namely , knowing the effect of treatment on @xmath9 allows prediction of the effect of treatment on the more clinically relevant outcome ( @xmath4 ) ( @xcite ) . once @xmath9 is proclaimed a `` surrogate endpoint , '' it invites efforts to find direct means of controlling @xmath9 .",

    "using a graphical representation to encode the assumptions articulated thus far , and further assuming that the disparity observed stems only from a difference in people s susceptibility to @xmath3 ( and not due to a change in some unobservable confounder ) , we will prove in section  [ sec4 ] that the correct transport formula should be @xmath116 which is different from both ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) .",

    "although this paper does not discuss the goodness - of - fit problem , standard methods are available for testing the compatibility of the selection diagram with the data available .",
    "the pattern that emerges from the examples discussed in section  [ sec2 ] indicates that transportability is a causal , not statistical notion . in other words , the conditions that license transport as well as the formulas through which results are transported depend on the causal relations between the variables in the domain , not merely on their statistics . for instance , it was important",
    "in example  [ ex3 ] to ascertain that the change in @xmath118 was due to the change in the way @xmath9 is affected by @xmath3 , but not due to a change in confounding conditions between the two .",
    "this can not be determined solely by comparing @xmath119 and @xmath117 .",
    "if @xmath3 and @xmath9 are confounded [ e.g. , figure  [ fig4a](e ) ] , it is quite possible for the inequality @xmath120 to hold , reflecting differences in confounding , while the way that @xmath9 is affected by @xmath3 ( i.e. , @xmath113 ) is the same in the two populations  a different transport formula will then emerge for this case .",
    "consequently , licensing transportability requires knowledge of the mechanisms , or processes , through which population differences come about ; different localization of these mechanisms yield different transport formulae .",
    "this can be seen most vividly in example  [ ex2 ] [ figure  [ fig1](b ) ] where we reasoned that no reweighing is necessary if the disparity @xmath103 originates with the way language proficiency depends on age , while the age distribution itself remains the same . yet , because age is not measured , this condition can not be detected in the probability distribution @xmath13 , and can not be distinguished from an alternative condition , @xmath121 one that may require reweighting according to equation ( [ eq1 ] ) . in other words ,",
    "every probability distribution @xmath44 that is compatible with the process of figure  [ fig1](b ) is also compatible with that of figure  [ fig1](a ) and , yet , the two processes dictate different transport formulas .",
    "based on these observations , it is clear that if we are to represent formally the differences between populations ( similarly , between experimental settings or environments ) , we must resort to a representation in which the causal mechanisms are explicitly encoded and in which differences in populations are represented as local modifications of those mechanisms .    to this end , we will use causal diagrams augmented with a set , @xmath70 , of `` selection variables , '' where each member of @xmath70 corresponds to a mechanism by which the two populations differ , and switching between the two populations will be represented by conditioning on different values of these @xmath70 variables .",

    "an example of the former is contrived in @xcite , where an alternative , necessary and sufficient condition is established in both graphical and algorithmic form .",
    "theorem  [ th2 ] provides , nevertheless , a simple and powerful method of establishing transportability in practice .",
    "given judgements of how target populations may differ from those under study , the paper offers a formal representational language for making these assessments precise and for deciding whether causal relations in the target population can be inferred from those obtained in an experimental study .",
    "when such inference is possible , the criteria provided by theorems [ th1 ] and [ th2 ] yield transport formulae , namely , principled ways of calibrating the transported relations so as to properly account for differences in the populations .",
    "these transport formulae enable the investigator to select the essential measurements in both the experimental and observational studies , and thus minimize measurement costs and sample variability .",
    "the inferences licensed by theorem  [ th1 ] and [ th2 ] represent worst case analysis , since we have assumed , in the tradition of nonparametric modeling , that every variable may potentially be an effect - modifier ( or moderator ) .",
    "if one is willing to assume that certain relationships are noninteractive , or monotonic as is the case in additive models , then additional transport licenses may be issued , beyond those sanctioned by theorems [ th1 ] and  [ th2 ] .",
    "while the results of this paper concern the transfer of causal information from experimental to observational studies , the method can also benefit in transporting statistical findings from one observational study to another ( @xcite ) .",
    "the rationale for such transfer is two - fold .",
    "first , information from the first study may enable researchers to avoid repeated measurement of certain variables in the target population .",
    "second , by pooling data from both populations , we increase the precision in which their commonalities are estimated and , indirectly , also increase the precision by which the target relationship is transported .",
    "substantial reduction in sampling variability can be thus achieved through this decomposition ( @xcite ) .",
    "clearly , the same data - sharing philosophy can be used to guide meta - analysis ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , where one attempts to combine results from many experimental and observational studies , each conducted on a different population and under a different set of conditions , so as to construct an aggregate measure of effect size that is `` better , '' in some formal sense , than any one study in isolation .",
    "while traditional approaches aims to average out differences between studies , our theory exploits the commonalities among the populations studied and the target population . by pooling together commonalities and discarding areas of disparity ,",
    "we gain maximum use of the available samples ( @xcite ) .",
    "to be of immediate use , our method relies on the assumption that the analyst is in possession of sufficient background knowledge to determine , at least qualitatively , where two populations may differ from one another .",
    "this knowledge is not vastly different from that required in any principled approach to causation in observational studies , since judgement about possible effects of omitted factors is crucial in any such analysis .",
    "whereas such knowledge may only be partially available , the analysis presented in this paper is nevertheless essential for understanding what knowledge is needed for the task to succeed and how sensitive conclusions are to knowledge that we do not possess .",
    "real - life situations will be marred , of course , with additional complications that were not addressed directly in this paper ; for example , measurement errors , selection bias , finite sample variability , uncertainty about the graph structure and the possible existence of unmeasured confounders between any two nodes in the diagram . such issues",
    "are not unique to transportability ; they plague any problem in causal analysis , regardless of whether they are represented formally or ignored by avoiding formalism .",
    "the methods offered in this paper are representative of what theory permits us to do in ideal situations , and the graphical representation presented in this paper makes the assumptions explicit and transparent .",
    "transparency is essential for reaching tentative consensus among researchers and for facilitating discussions to distinguish that which is deemed plausible and important from that which is negligible or implausible .",
    "finally , it is important to mention two recent extensions of the results reported in this article . @xcite",
    "have addressed the problem of transportability in cases where only a limited set of experiments can be conducted at the source environment .",
    "subsequently , the results were generalized to the problem of `` meta - transportability , '' that is , pooling experimental results from multiple and disparate sources to synthesize a consistent estimate of a causal relation at yet another environment , potentially different from each of the former ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is shown that such synthesis may be feasible from multiple sources even in cases where it is not feasible from any one source in isolation .",
