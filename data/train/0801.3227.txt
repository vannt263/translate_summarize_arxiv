    "in [ k ] khovanov introduced a homology theory for links in @xmath0 that was a categorification of the jones polynomial . in [ aps ] asaeda , przytycki and sikora extended this theory to links embedded in i - bundles .",
    "their homology theory incorporated some of the topology of the i - bundle into their invariant .",
    "turner and turaev showed in [ t ] that the homology from [ aps ] could be recreated using embedded surfaces as elements of the chain groups instead of decorated diagrams . in this paper",
    "we accomplish that in the case of i - bundles over orientable surfaces .",
    "section 2 contains definitions and explains the skein relations on surfaces that are used .",
    "section 3 defines the grading on the chain groups and which surfaces generate the chain groups .",
    "the boundary operator is defined in section 4 and it is also shown that it is well - defined with respect to the relations . in section 5",
    "it is proved that the boundary operator squared is equal to zero , and thus the boundary operator together with the chain groups form a chain complex .    finally , in section 6 it is shown that the homology produced from the chain complex coincides with the homology from [ aps ]",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     note that under @xmath4 the associated state is nt affected , thus for example if t @xmath5 tt by changing a smoothing before applying @xmath4 , then after applying @xmath4 the boundary circles behave the same way , and an inessential boundary circle turns into two inessential boundary circles by placing a bridge .",
