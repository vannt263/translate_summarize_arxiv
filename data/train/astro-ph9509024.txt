    "the origin of relativistic jets from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) remains one of the great challenges in astrophysics .",
    "earlier phinney ( 1982 , 1987 ) concluded that radiation from the accretion disk is probably not responsible for accelerating the superluminal agn jets with bulk lorentz factors @xmath0 ( @xcite ) . when @xmath1 , the aberrated photons in the jet s rest frame comes from the forward direction against the jet motion , thus limiting the maximum @xmath2 achievable to only a few , much smaller than the observed values .",
    "recently , observations of several galactic black hole ( gbh ) candidates have revealed a causal relation between x - ray and radio flaring of the central object . in some cases , radio plasmoids",
    "were ejected relativistically away from the central sources following the x - ray flares ( @xcite ) . in two cases , grs1915 ( @xcite ) and groj1655 ( @xcite )",
    ", the ejecta motions appear to be superluminal , resembling the superluminal agn sources .",
    "motivated by the correlation of the ejection with the x - ray flux , energetics of the ejecta and the relatively small @xmath3 , we proposed in a recent paper ( @xcite ) a scenario for the origin of the episodic ejections based on the standard inverse - compton accretion disk paradigm ( @xcite ) .",
    "the idea is that episodic quenching of the ( external and internal synchrotron ) soft photon source to a level less than the internal bremsstrahlung flux superheats the innermost disk to gamma ray temperatures ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , these gamma rays can not all escape , if their source compactness ( @xmath4 gamma ray luminosity / source size , @xcite ) is too high .",
    "instead most gamma rays are converted into pairs via photon - photon pair creation which will be further accelerated axially by the radiation pressure of the disk x - ray flux and attain significant terminal lorentz factors in a bipolar outflow if the disk luminosity is sufficiently high .",
    "when the ejecta encounters the interstellar medium and develops shocks and turbulence it will convert the bulk kinetic energy into high energy particles , emitting the observed radio synchrotron radiation .    in this paper , we summarize some key results for pair plasma formation and their radiation acceleration by the disk photons for gbhs .",
    "to study the formation of the pairs produced by @xmath5 and @xmath6x collisions _ outside _ the disk , we assume a 2-zone keplerian disk model depicted in fig.1 . we define @xmath7 as the boundary , interior ( exterior ) to which local bremsstrahlung flux is higher ( lower ) than the soft photon flux .",
    "gamma rays are emitted by a superheated ion torus within @xmath7 ( @xcite ) , the spectrum from this region is assumed to be a comptonized bremsstrahlung + annihilation spectrum with @xmath8 ( fig.1a , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "exterior to @xmath7 , we assume that the disk x - ray flux has the standard inverse - compton spectral shape ( fig.1b , @xcite ) . using standard photon - photon pair production cross - section",
    "we compute the ( angle - averaged ) gamma ray pair - production depth @xmath9 as a function of photon energy due to collisions among gamma rays and between gamma rays and disk x - rays : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the angle - averaged pair production cross - section ( @xcite ) , and @xmath12kev .",
    "@xmath13 is the normalized photon spectral density evaluated at @xmath7 , and @xmath14 is a fudge factor of order unity to incorporate various complex geometry and angle - dependent effects ( e.g. photon intensity anisotropy and variation with path length along the line of sight , angular dependence of @xmath15 , etc . ) .",
    "_ we calibrate @xmath14 using sample numerical simulations _ ( details to be published elsewhere ) . for given geometry and spectral shapes ( cf .",
    "fig.1 ) , @xmath9 basically depends only on the gamma ray source global compactness @xmath16 erg / cm / s ) ( @xcite ) . in fig.2a",
    "we plot @xmath9 as functions of photon energy for various @xmath17 and @xmath8 . in fig.2b",
    "we plot the fraction of gamma rays that are absorbed into pairs as a function of @xmath17 .",
    "we have assumed that all pairs produced escape without re - annihilation in situ due to their high kinetic energy ( @xmath18 few hundred kev ) .",
    "this is a crude approximation but we estimate the error to be less than a factor of 2 .",
    "the critical compactness at which @xmath19 of the gamma rays are converted into escaping pairs is around @xmath20 ( with @xmath21 uncertainty ) , consistent with similar results found by others ( zdziarski 1995 , private communications ) . to achieve @xmath22 ,",
    "liang & li ( 1995 ) show that the overall accretional luminosity @xmath23 must be @xmath24 @xmath25 .",
    "consider a plasma of electrons , positrons and some entrained protons directly above the black hole and along the axis of the disk , interacting with the disk radiation via only compton scattering ( cf .",
    "fig.1 ) . assuming that protons , electrons and positrons are always co - moving ( a cold jet ) , @xmath26 , and local charge neutrality is maintained ( @xmath27 ) ,",
    "we can obtain the equation of motion for the jet ( at height z ) as : @xmath28 { } ~+~{1\\over z_*^2}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , the angle between the photon momentum and the z - axis , and @xmath32 is the spectral intensity seen by the jet ( cf fig.1 , see @xcite for previous results ) .",
    "@xmath33 is the equivalent mass of the particles @xmath34  with @xmath35 , the fraction of proton loading . for @xmath36 , @xmath37  for a pure pair jet and for @xmath38 , @xmath39 for an electron - proton jet . in deriving equation ( [ motion ] ) ,",
    "we have : ( 1 ) kept only the parallel ( z ) component due to the axial - symmetry of the system ( though there will be a random orthogonal component ) ; ( 2 ) used the angle - dependent differential compton scattering cross section ( in thomson limit ) and ignored the energy change ( second order in scattered photon energy ) , but kept the momentum change ( first order in scattered photon energy ) for acceleration ; ( 3 ) included the gravity pull on protons and leptons but neglected the radiation force on protons .",
    "the ( isotropic ) spectral intensity at the disk surface can be approximated as : @xmath40    where @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "here , @xmath44 and @xmath45 define the size of the disk from which the total luminosity is @xmath23 , and we assume @xmath46 .",
    "we have used the observed spectrum of grs1915 ( @xcite ) , but results are insensitive to detailed spectral shape since it will be integrated away when putting into equation ( [ motion ] ) and only the total flux from each radius matters since we are working in the thomson limit ( as emphasized by the referee ) .",
    "the @xmath6-ray component from @xmath47 ( fig.1a ) produces negligible additional effects on the axial acceleration due to the strong @xmath48 self - absorption at high @xmath17 . substituting equation ( [ inten ] ) into equation ( [ motion ] )",
    "the integral over @xmath49 becomes an integral over @xmath50 ( cf .",
    "fig.1 ) .    equation ( [ motion ] ) can be evaluated numerically for the terminal @xmath51 .",
    "a key term in this equation is @xmath52 , which signifies the accelerating ( or decelerating ) force from a `` ring '' of radiation at radius @xmath50 , depending on whether it is negative ( or positive ) for particles at the height @xmath53 , where @xmath54 .",
    "one can find a disk radius @xmath55 , interior to which disk radiation accelerates the ejecta , and exterior to which radiation decelerates the ejecta . whether an ejecta can get net acceleration depends on the sum of these two contributions .",
    "the dependence of @xmath51 on the initial conditions ( @xmath56 ) and the geometry ( @xmath57 ) can be obtained by solving equation ( [ motion ] ) .",
    "we will focus on cases with @xmath58 first .",
    "the results are shown in figure 3 and summarized here .",
    "( a ) . for fixed disk geometry and total disk luminosity , _ regardless of their initial velocities @xmath59 _ , leptons will be accelerated to a fixed terminal @xmath51 , even though particles with high @xmath59 get decelerated first .",
    "the radiation field acts like a `` thermostat '' that regulates the particle s final velocity along the z - axis . in fig.3a",
    ", we show the ejecta s @xmath2 as a function of height @xmath53 with different initial velocities , whereas fixing @xmath60 .",
    "fig.3b , 3c , and 3d show the ejecta s @xmath2 as a function of height @xmath53 with different @xmath44 , different @xmath45 and different initial @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "again , @xmath62 .",
    "it is evident that , @xmath51 depends somewhat sensitively on @xmath44 since it is mostly the inner disk radiation that accelerates the ejecta ; on the other hand , the dependence on @xmath45 is weak as long as it is @xmath63 due to the radiation intensity drops down drastically as @xmath64 increases .",
    "note from equation ( [ motion ] ) that the rate of acceleration is proportional to @xmath65 , which is decreasing as @xmath66 .",
    "acceleration only occurs @xmath67 of the black hole if the conditions are favorable .",
    "@xmath51 is not a sensitive function of @xmath61 as long as @xmath68 .",
    "ejecta starting at very high @xmath53 is not of interest here .",
    "our main results are summarized in figure 4 , where we show the terminal @xmath51 as a function of @xmath69 for different proton loading @xmath70 with @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "it is evident that for @xmath74 , gravitational attraction on the protons hinders the acceleration .",
    "this has important implications for the composition of the ejecta .",
    "if the jets are composed of pure pairs as suggested in previous sections , then radiation acceleration can indeed account for the observed @xmath2 in both grs1915 and groj1655 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observed @xmath75 of grs1915 implies @xmath76 .",
    "this constrains the mass of black hole in grs1915 to @xmath77 when using the observed luminosity ( @xcite ) .",
    "the jet could be suffocated if there is an additional isotropic radiation field @xmath78 and it reaches @xmath79 of @xmath80 .",
    "@xmath78 could be caused by the companion wind or circumstellar medium .",
    "the pairs are born with average kinetic energy of several hundred kev .",
    "however , we do not expect the `` compton rocket '' effect ( @xcite ) to be important to affect the ejecta s terminal velocity because the disk radiation field will regulate the particle s final velocity , no matter what the initial velocity is , as shown in fig.3a .      to summarize , in the present approach",
    ", we have adopted the _ thermal _ accretion disk model for the hard x - ray emissions ( as suggested by the spectra of grs1915 , @xcite ) , and use that as the basis for the pair production and bulk acceleration .",
    "hence the energetics of the jet is constrained by the pre - ejection accretional x - ray power output ( @xcite ) .",
    "we find that , for a jet composed mostly of leptons , disk radiation can accelerate it to a terminal lorentz @xmath51 of a few , depending on the total disk luminosity and geometry .",
    "however , _ non - thermal _ processes may be needed to explain the power - law hard x - ray spectra of some x - ray novae ( including groj1655 , @xcite ) . yet",
    "both classes of gbhs show relativistic outflows .",
    "can gbh jets be also generated by say , purely electrodynamical processes unrelated to the conventional thermal hard x - ray disk models ?",
    "we will explore alternative models in future publications .",
