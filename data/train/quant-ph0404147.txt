    "its role in the study of slowly varying quantum mechanical systems spans a vast array of fields and applications , such as energy - level crossings in molecules @xcite , quantum field theory @xcite , and geometric phases berry:84,wilczek:84 . in recent years",
    ", geometric phases have been proposed to perform quantum information processing  @xcite , with adiabaticity assumed in a number of schemes for geometric quantum computation ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . moreover ,",
    "additional interest in adiabatic processes has arisen in connection with the concept of adiabatic quantum computing , in which slowly varying hamiltonians appear as a promising mechanism for the design of new quantum algorithms and even as an alternative to the conventional quantum circuit model of quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the notion of adiabaticity does not appear to have been extended in a systematic manner to the arena of _ open _ quantum systems , i.e. , quantum systems coupled to an external environment @xcite . such systems are of fundamental interest , as the notion of a closed system is always an idealization and approximation .",
    "this issue is particularly important in the context of quantum information processing , where environment - induced decoherence is viewed as a fundamental obstacle on the path to the construction of quantum information processors ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of this work is to systematically generalize the concept of adiabatic evolution to the realm of open quantum systems .",
    "formally , an open quantum system is described as follows .",
    "consider a quantum system @xmath1 coupled to an environment , or bath @xmath2 ( with respective hilbert spaces @xmath3 ) , evolving unitarily under the total system - bath hamiltonian @xmath4 .",

    "returning to the problem of adiabatic evolution , conceptually , the difficulty in the transition from closed to open systems is that the notion of hamiltonian eigenstates is lost , since the lindblad superoperator  the generalization of the hamiltonian  can not in general be diagonalized .",
    "it is then not _ a priori _ clear what should take the place of the adiabatic eigenstates .",
    "our key insight in resolving this difficulty is that this role is played by _",
    "adiabatic jordan blocks of the lindblad superoperator_. the jordan canonical form @xcite , with its associated left and right eigenvectors , is in this context the natural generalization of the diagonalization of the hamiltonian .",
    "specifically , we show that , for slowly varying lindblad superoperators , the time evolution of the density matrix , written in a suitable basis in the state space of linear operators , occurs separately in sets of jordan blocks related to each lindblad eigenvalue .",
    "this treatment for adiabatic processes in open systems is potentially rather attractive as it can simplify the description of the dynamical problem by breaking down the lindblad superoperator into a set of decoupled blocks . in order to clearly exemplify this behavior ,",
    "we analyze a simple two - level open system for which the exact solution of the master equation ( [ eq : t - lind ] ) can be analytically determined .",

    "adjoint elements @xmath101 in the dual state space are given by row vectors defined as the transpose conjugate of @xmath102 : @xmath103 .",
    "a density matrix can then be expressed as a discrete superposition of states over a complete basis in this vector space , with appropriate constraints on the coefficients so that the requirements of hermiticity , positive semidefiniteness , and unit trace of @xmath83 are observed .",
    "thus , representing the density operator in general as a coherence vector , we can rewrite eq .",

    "is achieved through the choice of a basis which preserves the jordan block structure as , for example , the sets of right @xmath129 and left @xmath138 vectors introduced in sec .",
