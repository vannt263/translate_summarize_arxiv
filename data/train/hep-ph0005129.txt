    "hard partons , produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions at rhic and lhc , will undergo multiple rescattering inside the nuclear environment before entering the hadronization process outside the nuclear environment ( or in a very dilute one ) .",
    "this follows from standard formation time arguments .",
    "prior to hadronization , medium - induced radiative energy loss is expected to be the main medium modification encountered by hard partons .",
    "the size of this effect depends on the density and nature of the medium and may be significantly enhanced in a deconfined partonic medium  @xcite .",
    "a corresponding strong medium - modification of the high - pt tails of hadronic single particle spectra ( `` jet quenching '' )  @xcite is thus a tentative signal for the formation of a deconfined state .",
    "this possibility has motivated many studies of medium - induced gluon radiation in recent years  @xcite .",
    "most recent studies of the non - abelian energy loss are carried out within the gyulassy - wang ( gw ) model  @xcite which mimics the medium by a set of coloured static scattering centers . despite its simplicity , this model is of phenomenological interest , since the medium - induced radiative energy loss belongs to those observables which depend mainly on the average transverse colour field strength encountered by the parton rather than on the model - specific details with which this colour field strength is described  @xcite .",
    "first studies of the gw model  @xcite focussed on the rescattering of the hard quark and arrived at a radiative energy loss @xmath2 independent of the path length .",
    "baier - dokshitzer - mueller - peign - schiff ( bdmps )  @xcite established later that gluon rescattering diagrams give the dominant contribution .",
    "they found a potentially dramatic linear increase @xmath3 of the energy loss with the medium thickness @xmath4 .",
    "this can be understood in terms of an uncertainty argument of brodsky and hoyer  @xcite which relates the average transverse gluon momentum @xmath5 to the radiative energy loss @xmath6 .",
    "brownian motion of the rescattering gluon then implies @xmath7 and the quadratic @xmath4-dependence of radiative energy loss in the bdmps formalism .",
    "while all these studies start from the complete set of multiple scattering diagrams , zakharov  @xcite has advocated a different and very elegant approach to the same problem . in his path - integral formalism",
    ", the radiation cross section is determined by a dipole cross section which essentially measures the difference between elastic scattering amplitudes of different projectile fock state components as a function of impact parameter .",
    "baier , dokshitzer , mueller and schiff ( bdms ) have shown  @xcite that the evolution of the rescattering amplitude in the bdmps - formalism is determined by zakharov s dipole cross section .",
    "the above mentioned calculations do not have a clear connection to experiment since the total radiative energy loss @xmath8 is not an experimental observable .",
    "unlike the situation in qed where the charged projectile can in principle be arbitrarily well separated from its radiation , medium - induced qcd bremsstrahlung is only an observable to the extent to which it is emitted kinematically well separated outside the typical hadronization cone of the hard parton .",
    "realistic energy loss estimates thus require knowledge about the @xmath1-differential gluon radiation spectrum .",
    "first calculations of this observable were published a year ago in the zakharov  @xcite and in the bdmps - formalism  @xcite .",
    "these studies contain essential steps towards a phenomenological application : especially , ref .",
    "@xcite shows how to rewrite zakharov s path - integral formalism in a simple , numerically accessible form , and ref .",
    "@xcite gives results for the radiation outside the kinematically unresolvable hadronization cone of the parton .",
    "however , calculating the angular distribution is not the only problem in making contact with phenomenology .",
    "another problem is that the concept of a homogeneous medium of finite extent , underlying the bdmps and zakharov formalisms , may not be applicable to heavy ion collisions at rhic and lhc .",
    "unlike the situation in qed , where even the thinnest targets probed in experiments of the landau - pomeranchuk- migdal effect amount to @xmath9 small - angle scatterings , one expects for the medium - induced radiation off hard partons in relativistic heavy ion collisions a much smaller average number of rescatterings , say @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the bdmps- and zakharov- formalisms with results for a small fixed number @xmath11 of rescatterings is needed to understand to what extent the concept of a homogeneous medium can be justified for such an extremely thin medium .",
    "the only existing studies  @xcite of scenarios with very few @xmath12 scattering centers assume implicitly an exclusive measurement of jet , gluon and recoil target partons .",
    "they are thus restricted to the study of a subclass of all available rescattering diagrams , and their results do not compare directly to the bdmps and zakharov formalisms ( see below for more details ) .",
    "it is one of the results of the present paper to calculate the gluon radiation spectrum for a `` medium '' of very few @xmath12 scattering centers , including all available rescattering diagrams , thus allowing for a direct comparison .",
    "more generally , we discuss in which sense the @xmath0-th order term in the opacity expansion of zakharov s result is related to radiation off a target of a fixed number @xmath0 of scattering centers .    from a technical point of view",
    ", the present work is an application and extension of methods developped in  @xcite .",
    "there , we have derived the non - abelian furry approximation for the wavefunction of a hard parton which undergoes multiple rescattering in a spatially extended colour field .",
    "this furry wavefunction provides a compact shorthand for the high - energy limit of the complete class of final state rescattering diagrams .",
    "relevant for the present work is that we have developped in ref .",
    "@xcite diagrammatic tools to determine under which conditions observables of a multiple partonic rescattering process are colour trivial .",
    "_ colour triviality _ is the remarkable fact that for some rescattering processes , the sum of all contributions to the @xmath0-fold rescattering depends on a unique @xmath0-th power of the @xmath13 casimir operators , rather than to depend on colour interference terms associated to more than one colour trace .",
    "this renders the calculational problem essentially abelian and is crucial for going beyond very few rescatterings where brute force perturbative calculations are still feasible .",
    "colour triviality is thus an important property in the study of non - abelian gluon bremsstrahlung .",
    "the present work applies the non - abelian furry approximation to the calculation of the medium - induced gluon radiation cross section . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    ", we derive the radiation cross section in terms of furry wavefunctions . from this",
    ", we derive in section  [ sec3 ] a set of diagrammatic identities which automate the proof of colour triviality . in section  [ sec4 ] , these identities are applied to derive an explicitly colour trivial diagrammatic expression for the @xmath0-th order term of the opacity expansion of the @xmath1-differential gluon radiation spectrum .",
    "contact with analytical expressions is made by showing that the sum over all @xmath0-th order contributions results in a path - integral expression which essentially coincides with zakharov s result . in section  [ sec5 ]",
    ", we relate this path - integral expression to the radiation off a target of a fixed number of scattering centers .",

    "we extend these calculations to the radiation off _ nascent _ quarks produced in the medium .",
    "the gluon radiation cross section associated with them is characterized by a superscript @xmath15 and gives access to the interference pattern between hard and medium - dependent radiation .",

    "<S> we study the relation between the baier - dokshitzer - mueller - peign - schiff ( bdmps ) and zakharov formalisms for medium - induced gluon radiation off hard quarks , and the radiation off very few scattering centers . based on the non - abelian furry approximation for the motion of hard partons in a spatially extended colour field , we derive a compact diagrammatic and explicitly colour trivial expression for the @xmath0-th order term of the @xmath1-differential gluon radiation cross section in an expansion in the opacity of the medium . resumming this quantity to all orders in opacity </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain zakharov s path - integral expression ( supplemented with a regularization prescription ) . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a new proof of the equivalence of the bdmps and zakharov formalisms which extends previous arguments to the @xmath1-differential cross section . </S>",
    "<S> we give explicit analytical results up to third order in opacity for both the gluon radiation cross section of free incoming and of in - medium produced quarks . the @xmath0-th order term in the opacity expansion of the radiation cross section </S>",
    "<S> is found to be a convolution of the radiation associated to @xmath0-fold rescattering and a readjustment of the probabilities that rescattering occurs with less than @xmath0 scattering centers . </S>",
    "<S> both informations can be disentangled by factorizing out of the radiation cross section a term which depends only on the mean free path of the projectile . </S>",
    "<S> this allows to infer analytical expressions for the totally coherent and totally incoherent limits of the radiation cross section to arbitrary orders in opacity .    </S>",
