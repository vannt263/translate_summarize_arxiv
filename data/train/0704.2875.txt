    "since the discovery of high-@xmath2 superconductivity two decades ago , a great effort has been put into the search for a unified microscopic mechanism for both superconductivity as well as anomalous spin and charge properties in the cuprates .    in this paper ,",
    "i shall review a systematic endeavor along a particular line approaching the doped mott insulator / doped antiferromagnet , which has been proposed@xcite as the unique property of the cuprates due to the strong coulomb interaction .",
    "it has gradually become a consensus that the doped mott insulator physics holds the key to understanding the cuprate superconductor , and distinguishes the latter from a conventional bcs superconductor",
    ".    the present line , known as the phase string theory , will be characteristically different from the main - stream approach to a doped mott insulator .",
    "the latter has been mainly built on the resonating valence bond ( rvb ) pairing of _ fermionic _ spins and the spin - charge separation in the early proposals,@xcite the latest developments of which have been summarized and reviewed in refs .",
    "pbcswf , f - rvb .    the phase string theory , on the other hand , has been built on a singular nonlocal effect hidden in a typical doped mott insulator , _",
    "e.g. _ , the @xmath3-@xmath1 model .",
    "this effect is largely omitted in other approaches , but is critical in constructing a self - consistent theory of the doped antiferromagnet evolving continuously from the half - filling mott - antiferromagnetic insulator .",
    "i shall present a rich phase diagram with complex phenomena as the physical consequences of the phase string effect .",
    "one will see that the rvb and spin - charge separation concepts remain essential , but they will also acquire a distinct mathematical characterization in this theory .    although the leading order results of the phase string theory share some striking similarity with the experimental measurements in the cuprates , in this review , a direct comparison with experiment will be _ minimal _ , partly due to the length limitation and partly because i wish to emphasize that the physical consequences naturally flow from the _ theoretical structure _ , not from a phenomenology based on the experiment .",
    "i will not be able to discuss many interesting theoretical efforts along _ different _ lines of thought in this brief review , also due to the space limitation , which may be found through our original papers in the references .",
    "the rest of the paper will be organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , i will discuss some important general properties of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model , including the marshall sign rule , bosonic rvb description , phase string effect , and exact phase string formalism . in sec . 3 , based on the phase string formalism",
    ", i will describe how an effective theory , known as the phase string model , is constructed . in sec .",
    "4 , the physical consequences of the phase string model will be given which cover the superconducting phase , lower and upper pseudogap phases , high - temperature normal state , as well as low - doping antiferromagnetic state .",
    "finally , a synthesis and perspectives are presented in sec .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 model is defined by @xmath4:@xmath5and @xmath6with a restricted hilbert space under the no double occupancy constraint @xmath7    due to the no double occupancy constraint , the @xmath0-@xmath1 model describes a mott insulator at half filling with @xmath8 , where the hopping term @xmath9 and the superexchange term @xmath10 depicts the heisenberg antiferromagnetic ( af ) interaction in the unfrozen spin degrees of freedom .",
    "away from the half filling , charge carriers are introduced with removing or injecting electrons into the system , which are known as the hole or electron - doped mott insulators . since the half - filling case is an af spin state , the doped system",
    "can be also properly called a doped antiferromagnet .    for a bipartite lattice with only the nearest - neighboring ( nn ) hopping and superexchange couplings [ denoted by @xmath11 in eqs .",
    "( [ ht0 ] ) and ( [ hj0 ] ) ] , there exists a particle - hole symmetry and one may only focus on the hole - doped side without loss of generality .",
    "note that the next nn hopping may be important in real materials and its effect will be commented on in sec .",
    "5 .      at half - filling",
    ", the @xmath0-@xmath1 model reduces to the heisenberg model , where the physical properties are fairly well understood , as a consensus , in contrast to the doped case .",
    "this model predicts a long - range nel order in the ground state as well as low - lying spin - wave excitations , consistent with experiment .",
    "it is important to point out that in the study of the doped case , one needs to have a correct description of spin correlations not only at long distance , but at _ all ranges_. this is because the hole hopping in @xmath12 involves the nn sites , which  will be generally quite sensitive to the short - range spin correlations .",
    "thus , as a starting point , a precise description of both long and short range spin correlations at half - filling is essential .",
    "as proven by marshall,@xcite the ground - state wave function of the heisenberg model for a bipartite lattice must be real and satisfies a sign rule .",
    "this sign rule dictates that the flip of a pair of antiparallel spins at two opposite sublattice sites will always be accompanied by a sign change in the wave function .",
    "this marshall sign rule may be easily understood as below .",
    "define a spin basis state with the built - in marshall signs as@xmath13where @xmath14 denotes the total number of down spins at the @xmath15 sublattice such that the aforementioned marshall sign rule is always satisfied .",
    "then it is straightforward to verify that the matrix element of @xmath16 under the complete set @xmath17 is negative definite@xmath18so that for the ground state @xmath19the wave function @xmath20 is always real and positive ( except for a trivial global phase ) .      while the exact ground state of the heisenberg model in two dimensions ( 2d ) is not known , the best variational state proposed by liang , doucot and anderson is given by@xcite @xmath21where @xmath22 stands for a singlet spin pairing at two opposite sublattice sites @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , the positive weight factor associated with it .",
    "since each singlet bond @xmath22 automatically satisfies the marshall sign rule , the total wave function can be easily shown to obey the sign rule as well .",
    "the variational wave function in eq . ( [ lda ] ) can produce@xcite an unrivaled accurate ground - state energy ( @xmath26 per bond as compared to the exact numerical value of @xmath27 per bond for the heisenberg model ) .",
    "since the energy of the heisenberg model is directly related to the nn spin - spin correlation , a good variational energy also means a good description of short - range spin correlations . on the other hand",
    ", this wave function possesses an af long - range order ( aflro ) in the spin correlation function with a similarly accurate magnetization as the system size is extrapolated to infinity.@xcite      now let us consider doping .",
    "in the above we have seen that the ground state wave function of the heisenberg model satisfies the marshall sign .",
    "in fact , such a marshall sign rule would hold even at arbitrary doping , if holes remain static on lattice sites .",
    "consider the single hole case for example .",
    "define the following spin basis incorporating the marshall signs similar to eq .",
    "( [ marshall ] ) @xmath28where @xmath29 denotes the hole site . then it is straightforward to check that @xmath30still holds to ensure the marshall sign rule .",
    "but once the hole starts to move , the marshall sign rule will be scrambled by the hopping of the hole .",
    "indeed , based on eq .",
    "( [ marshall1 ] ) the hopping matrix is given by    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the site @xmath33 spin index in the state @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is different from @xmath36 by an exchange of the spin @xmath32 with the hole at site @xmath37 since @xmath38 , the hopping matrix element is no longer sign definite .",
    "based on eq .",
    "( [ matrix - h ] ) , a hole hops on the lattice will pick up a product of sequential @xmath39 and @xmath40 signs,@xcite    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the number of @xmath43 spins which are exchanged with the hole during its hopping on a given path @xmath44 . because of eq .",
    "( [ matrix - j ] ) , the superexchange interaction can not repair  such a _ phase string effect _ created by the nn hole hopping.@xcite    for example , the single - hole propagator @xmath45 with @xmath46 may be formally expressed as    @xmath47    in which for each path @xmath44 connecting @xmath23 and @xmath48 there is a phase string factor @xmath49 weighted by @xmath50 with @xmath51at @xmath52 , whose proof is based on eq .",

    "it has been concluded that either the quasiparticle weight vanishes@xcite or the doped hole is self - localized@xcite due to the phase string effect in a spin background with long - range af correlation ( in the half - filling limit ) .    one can similarly demonstrate the irreparable phase string effect in an _ arbitrary _ multi - hole case although the formulation will be slightly modified with the emergence of an extra sign factor @xmath60 in additional to @xmath49 , where @xmath61 is the number of the exchanges between the _ holes _ and @xmath44 here denotes the multi - hole paths.@xcite    the significant role of the phase string factor @xmath49 in eqs .",
    "( [ propagator ] ) and ( [ m ] ) is to cause strong _ phase interference _ between different hole paths and thus greatly influence the charge dynamics .",
    "but since the spin degrees of freedom are involved in @xmath62 , the spin correlations will also get _ simultaneously _ reshaped to minimize the total kinetic and superexchange energy .",
    "therefore , the irreparable phase string effect will play a role to _ mediate _ nonlocal mutual influence between the charge and spin degrees of freedom as a new kind of _ interaction _ which emerges from the strongly correlated system of doped mott insulator / antiferromagnet .",
    "the factor @xmath63 is very singular , as a fluctuation in @xmath42 by @xmath64 can result in a total sign change .",
    "so the quantum fluctuations are normally extremely strong especially for long paths , and there is no well - controlled quantum many - body method to directly handle such an effect . alternatively a unitary transformation @xmath65 can be explicitly introduced@xcite to precisely keep track of the phase string effect . then , with the marshall sign basis @xmath66 [ _ cf _ , eq .",
    "( [ marshall ] ) ] being changed to @xmath67 , the new ground - state wave function @xmath68 in  @xmath69 should become more or less conventional  as the singular phase string effect is now sorted out into @xmath70 .    the @xmath0-@xmath1 hamiltonian in this new representation , known as the phase string formalism,@xcite is expected to be perturbatively treatable as the singular part of the phase string effect is gauged away  by the unitary transformation . in the following , we shall present such an exact reformulation of the @xmath0-@xmath1 hamiltonian at arbitrary doping .",
    "the phase string formalism is equivalent to bosonizing  the electron operator as follows@xcite @xmath71where holon  @xmath72 and spinon  @xmath73 operators are both _ bosonic _ fields , satisfying the constraint @xmath74the nonlocal phase string factor @xmath75 in eq .",

    "it is easily verified that the fermionic statistics of @xmath83 is automatically ensured by @xmath75 , in which the factor @xmath84 ( @xmath85 is the total holon number operator ) guarantees anticommutation relations between opposite spins , and the factor @xmath86 ( for @xmath87 even / odd ) is a staggered factor added for convenience .",
    "furthermore , the equality ( [ constr ] ) replaces the original no double occupancy constraint ( [ constraint ] ) imposed on the electron operator .",

    "therefore , these gauge fields will be well tractable at least in low doping and low temperature regimes .",

    ", the bosonic spinons will be effectively turned into fermions and a fermi liquid state may be recovered if the bosonic holons remain condensed in the high - doping regime .",
    "so the phase string model may simply reduce to the slave - boson mean - field description at @xmath720 .",
    "finally we remark on that throughout this paper , only the nearest neighboring hopping of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model is considered , which is related to the origin of the singular phase string effect . however , the phase string effect will get qualitatively modified in the presence of the next nearest neighbor hopping process .",
    "this is an important issue which has not been touched upon so far .",
    "just like the phase string effect is very singular in the original @xmath0-@xmath1 model , the next nearest neighbor hopping term will also become singular in the phase string formalism .",
    "it is thus expected to be important to interpret the detailed experimental measurements in the cuprates , _",
    "e.g. , _ the asymmetry in the hole- and electron - doped cuprates .",
    "this work is partially supported by the nsfc grants ."

    "<S> the recent developments of the phase string theory for doped antiferromagnets will be briefly reviewed . </S>",
    "<S> such theory is built upon a singular phase string effect induced by the motion of holes in a doped antiferromagnet , which as a precise property of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model dictates the novel competition between the charge and spin degrees of freedom . a global phase diagram including the antiferromagnetic , superconducting , lower and upper pseudogap , and high - temperature normal  phases , as well as a series of anomalous physical properties of these phases will be presented as the self - consistent and systematic consequences of the phase string theory . </S>"
