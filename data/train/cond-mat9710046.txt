    "2 laplacian growth  growth of a region @xmath0 along the gradient of its external green s function  is a model for a number of growth processes which occur in nature , among them growth by electrodeposition @xcite , diffusion - limited aggregation @xcite , and viscous fingering at fluid - fluid interfaces @xcite .",
    "these natural processes exhibit very complicated morphologies , as does the mathematical model . in spite of the large amount of work which has been done , one still has the feeling that there is something mysterious about laplacian growth .",
    "in particular , its extreme sensitivity to perturbations makes it difficult to interpret experiments , real or numerical .",
    "a special role is played in the two - dimensional problem by the conformal mapping method , as developed in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , for example .",
    "this method gives insight difficult to attain otherwise .",
    "it is especially simple in radial geometry . in outline ,",
    "one parametrizes the growing 2-dimensional region @xmath0 , thought of as occupying a bounded , simply connected region in the complex w - plane , by the conformal map @xmath1 which takes the exterior of the unit disk , @xmath2 , onto the exterior of @xmath0 . the growth of @xmath0 is then represented by the time dependence of the conformal map @xmath3 .",
    "since @xmath3 is holomorphic in @xmath2 , and its dependence at infinity is also prescribed , @xmath3 may , in turn , be parametrized by its singularities in the unit disk @xmath4 .",
    "the growth becomes the dynamics of those singularities .",
    "this method eliminates sources of inaccuracy which are unavoidable in other methods , for example the statistical noise which accompanies dla simulations , or some of the roundoff and truncation errors of more straightforward integration methods .",
    "that does not make the conformal mapping method necessarily more realistic , of course .",
    "indeed , the noise in other numerical methods may model actual physical noise , and hence be desirable , if one s aim is to model particular examples of laplacian - like growth . with the conformal mapping method we aim rather to strip the problem down to its simplest form , to see what remains and is common to all such processes .    in reference @xcite this process of stripping down",
    "was taken one level further , and an unexpected phenomenon came to light .",
    "this case might be called singular laplacian growth , because it is the limiting case in which all the singularities of @xmath3 are _ on _ the unit circle @xmath5 . in this case @xmath3",
    "degenerates to a schwarz - cristoffel map onto the exterior of a degenerate polygon @xmath0 of zero area ( i.e. , @xmath0 looks like a tree graph ) . in this limit",
    "the dynamics becomes 1-dimensional , and can be understood completely .",
    "the surprise is that the dynamics allows the singularities of @xmath3 to split and proliferate , but it does not require this .",
    "that is , while the dynamics is formally given by differential equations , the solutions , for given initial data , are not unique .",
    "the comment was made in ref .",
    "@xcite that this appears `` unlike any other physical model . '' in particular , it is not the same as being very sensitive to initial conditions , as one might have assumed .",
    "in fact , as we show below , singular laplacian growth is not at all sensitive in this way .",
    "its peculiarities have a different origin .",
    "reference @xcite gave only the simplest example ( in which all maps could be written down explicitly ) , and not a general computable theory .",
    "the present paper gives the general theory .",
    "let @xmath6 be a time - dependent conformal map of the exterior of the unit disk in the @xmath7 plane onto the exterior of the domain @xmath0 in the @xmath8 plane .",
    "g has the form @xmath9 suppose for the moment that @xmath10 , the boundary of @xmath0 , is an analytic jordan curve so that there is no difficulty in defining @xmath11    as shown by shraiman and bensimon @xcite , laplacian growth implies that the conformal map has time dependence given by @xmath12 where , if @xmath13 then @xmath14 define new scaled variables @xmath15 and a new independent variable @xmath16 by @xmath17 in terms of these variables , eq .",
    "( [ shr ] ) becomes @xmath18 because of the rescaling in eqs.([scale1 ] ) and ( [ scale2 ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ scaled ] ) continues to make sense even in the limit as singularities of the conformal map move onto the unit circle . for example , @xmath19 for all @xmath20 , even though @xmath21 blows up .",
    "we define the @xmath22 s , in case there are singularities on the unit circle , to have their limiting values as the singularities move onto the unit circle from the inside . with this understanding , eq .",
    "( [ scaled ] ) describes laplacian growth , both singular and nonsingular , in terms of the scaled mapping function @xmath23}{c_0[(t(s)]}=z\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty a_k(s)z^{-k}.\\ ] ]    in the singular case , in which all singularities of @xmath24 are on the unit circle , @xmath24 is a schwarz - christoffel map onto a degenerate polygon , and therefore its derivative has the form @xmath25 as a conformal map , @xmath24 has singularities at points on the unit circle which we have called @xmath26 and @xmath27 . the image of an arc of the unit circle under @xmath24 ,",
    "so long as it does not contain a singularity , is a straight line segment . at the singularity @xmath26 , however , the image line turns through the angle @xmath28 , which may be either positive ( counterclockwise ) or negative ( clockwise ) .",
    "it is understood that @xmath29 . at the singularity",
    "@xmath27 the image turns through the angle @xmath30 , i.e. , the line retraces itself : see fig .",
    "1 . the @xmath31 singularity may seem to be only a special case of the @xmath32 singularity , corresponding to @xmath33 , but we have distinguished it because growth takes place entirely at the @xmath31 singularities : the @xmath31 s are different .",
    "( notation : @xmath34=``angle '' ; @xmath32=``branch point '' ; @xmath31= `` growth tip . ''",
    "the @xmath35 of this paper was called @xmath36 in @xcite . )",
    "the @xmath35 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are by no means arbitrary .",
    "first , because the image polygon turns through a total angle @xmath37 , by conformality , one must have , since there are @xmath38 branchpoints and @xmath39 growth tips , @xmath40 second , because the image polygon looks like a tree graph , each edge of the image is traversed twice , once in each direction .",
    "this means that the integrals of @xmath41 along arcs of the unit circle from one singularity to the next , which are singular integrals , must cancel in pairs , an intricate condition on the positions of the @xmath32 s and @xmath31 s .",
    "suppose at time @xmath42 we have such a conformal map @xmath24 .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath24 , eq . ( [ scaled ] ) , should be recast as equations of motion for the singularities of @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath43 s of eq . (",
    "[ scaled ] ) are just the coefficients in the power series for @xmath24 , according to eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) , but we still need the @xmath22 s .",
    "to compute the @xmath22 s , using eqs .",
    "( [ defdk ] ) and ( [ scale1 ] ) , we must fourier transform @xmath44 , restricted to the unit circle , with the singularities displaced slightly inside .",
    "the fourier transform integrals are dominated by the @xmath31 singularities , and as the singularities move onto the unit circle , the entire contribution comes from them .",
    "thus there is a simple formula for @xmath22 , @xmath45 here the `` weights '' @xmath46 are determined by @xmath47 with the constant of proportionality determined by the normalization @xmath48 define the function @xmath49 then multiplying each side of eq . ( [ scaled ] ) by @xmath50 and summing over @xmath20 gives @xmath51 it is @xmath41 rather than @xmath24 that we know explicitly , so take the derivative of eq .",
    "( [ dhds ] ) with respect to @xmath7 .",
    "the left side becomes @xmath52 and the right side becomes an explicitly known expression .",
    "one can now cancel the factor @xmath53 in all terms .",
    "multiplying by @xmath54 and taking the limit as @xmath55 isolates @xmath56 , and similarly multiplying by @xmath57 and taking the limit as @xmath58 isolates @xmath59 . the result , after algebraic simplification , using eqs .",
    "( [ normalizev ] ) and ( [ sumangles ] ) , is @xmath60 we can also note @xmath61 where @xmath62 it is understood in eq .",
    "( [ wk ] ) that @xmath63 is real and positive .",
    "( [ dbetads])-([w ] ) represent the dynamics of singular laplacian growth as an autonomous system of ode s .    remarkably , this system is a kind of gradient system : @xmath64 this is gradient flow in the space of parameters @xmath65 endowed with the metric tensor @xmath66 since , according to eq .",
    "( [ sumangles ] ) , the @xmath34 s are negative , on average , if @xmath67 , this metric is indefinite .",
    "the gradient flow is toward certain critical points of @xmath68 which are not minima .",
    "these critical points are the equilibria of singular laplacian growth .",
    "they can be found by integrating the system of eqs .",
    "( [ dbetads])-([w ] ) . even if the starting state does not satisfy all the conditions described after eq .",
    "( [ sumangles ] ) , it will still approach a state which does satisfy them .",
    "we describe these equilibrium states more precisely below .",
    "this stability of the flow , which is a familiar property of gradient flows , is an indication that singular laplacian growth is _ not _ sensitive to initial conditions , contrary to what one might have expected , and hence that the peculiar sensitivity of laplacian growth in general has either been lost in the passage to the singular case , or that it arises from some other cause .",
    "we suggest below that that other cause is the non - uniqueness property of the system , still to be described .",
    "the dynamics of singularities described by eqs .",
    "( [ dbetads])-([w ] ) can be pictured very simply .",
    "the @xmath32 s are repelled by the @xmath31 s on the unit circle , and the @xmath31 s repel each other .",
    "the `` strength '' with which each @xmath27 repels other singularities is given by the corresponding @xmath69 ( always @xmath70 ) .",
    "the @xmath32 s , on the other hand , do not interact directly with each other . no singularity can pass through another one  they always keep the same order around the unit circle . those @xmath71 between any two adjacent @xmath31 s are , however , driven by them toward some intermediate point where , in effect , they coalesce into a single effective @xmath32 , characterized by a single effective @xmath34 which is the sum of all the contributing @xmath72 . the way a @xmath32 singularity approaches its limit position is the way @xmath73 approaches 0 in @xmath74 namely @xmath75 that is , it takes infinite time . by the second derivative test , there is only one equilibrium position for the @xmath32 s between each pair of @xmath31 s . here",
    "all the @xmath32 s will collect .",
    "thus in the limit as @xmath76 the equilibrium states of singular laplacian growth have @xmath31 s and @xmath32 s alternating , and look like @xmath39 needles radiating from a single central point .",
    "one can even write a formula in closed form for @xmath24 in this case , @xmath77 where the @xmath32 s and @xmath34 s are the effective ones . we can also understand this outcome , in a more physical way , by realizing that the continual rescaling means all internal structure shrinks to a point , leaving only the growth tips as visible features .",
    "what is not obvious from this description , but is observed , is that typically some of the @xmath31 s are entrained with the @xmath32 s , and coalesce with them ( where they contribute @xmath78 to the effective @xmath34 ) .",
    "this amounts to the scaling away of needles .",
    "it turns out that the generic stable equilibria have @xmath79 . if the initial configuration has @xmath80 , and is the least bit asymmetrical , some of the growing tips lose out in the competition to grow , and disappear as @xmath76 , leaving only three ( or fewer ) needles in the limit .",
    "this result might appear puzzling , since it seems to imply that laplacian growth should be a process of _ simplification _ , contrary to the increasing complexity which is observed , and which is the whole motivation for studying it .",
    "that puzzle is resolved in the next section .",
    "if one reverses the sense of time and integrates the system backwards , the repelling character of the @xmath31 s becomes an attraction . in particular ,",
    "two @xmath32 s adjacent on either side of a @xmath31 may be attracted to it , move toward it , and coalesce with it , essentially annihilating , leaving just the @xmath31 . unlike the coalescence described at the end of the previous section , which takes infinite time , this coalescence occurs _ in finite time_. roughly , one can estimate from eq .",
    "( [ dbetads ] ) that a @xmath32 approaches a nearby @xmath31 the way x(s ) approaches 0 in @xmath81 ( integrating backward from @xmath42 ) , namely @xmath82 at times earlier than the coalescence time @xmath83 , the @xmath32 singularities were simply not present .",
    "if one now examines this solution to the system with the usual forward sense of time , one sees , at some arbitrary time -@xmath84 , two @xmath32 singularities suddenly produced on either side of a @xmath31 , which had nt been there before . to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ sumangles ] ) , the @xmath34 s which characterize these @xmath32 s must add to zero .",
    "the geometrical effect of this process is that a kink of deviation angle @xmath34 suddenly appears in the growing needle represented by @xmath31 , like the kink shown in fig .",
    "1 , which might have formed from a single straight needle .",
    "this kinking may happen at any arbitrary time .",
    "a more careful argument ( in the appendix ) says that if a kink forms at @xmath31 at @xmath42 , the leading behavior in the motion of singularities is @xmath85 with @xmath86 .",
    "in addition , a second kind of coalescence is seen in backward integration , in which two @xmath32 s , with angles @xmath87 and @xmath88 on either side of a @xmath31 , coalesce to leave a single @xmath32 with angle @xmath89 .",
    "this happens only if @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "geometrically it corresponds to the shrinking away of a needle in finite time ( the growth tip @xmath31 is lost ) , on the outside of a corner of angle @xmath89 .",
    "what it means in forward integration is that at any time a needle may begin _ growing _ on the outside of a corner , as in the process which takes fig . 1 to fig",
    "the motion of singularities in this case , in leading order , is @xmath92 with @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "@xcite the factor @xmath89 in the exponent s denominator mistakenly appeared in the numerator . )",
    "the observations of section iii mean that the system of ode s eqs .",
    "( [ dbetads])-([w ] ) , although it looks unremarkable , has the peculiar property that its solutions are highly non - unique .",
    "new singularities can appear by the above two elementary processes at any time . in combination",
    "one has more complicated processes : a kink followed by a new needle at the outside of the new corner amounts to tip splitting , for example , and this can happen at any time .",
    "the equilibria described in section ii are never attained if such processes , which are allowed by the differential equation , continually intervene . thus singular laplacian growth supports complex non - equilibrium behavior after all .",
    "it is interesting to see what the model looks like if one integrates it forward , introduces new singularities , integrates again , adds more singularities , etc .",
    "examples are shown in figs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , where symmetrical tip splitting was introduced at intervals of 0.1 time unit . to interpret the evolving positions of singularities in terms of the corresponding image region @xmath0 , which is what is shown , it was necessary to integrate eq .",
    "( [ dhdz ] ) numerically .",
    "each edge is represented by a singular integral .",
    "these integrals were done by gauss - jacobi integration , as described by l.n .",
    "trefethen in ref .",
    "the accumulating error in these numerical integrals , as one steps along each edge to the next , especially in light of the usual sensitivity of numerical conformal maps , might have been expected to produce nonsensical pictures , but in fact the numerical error ( failure to retrace edges accurately ) is just barely visible in these examples .",
    "( eventually , of course , the accumulating error does become large , but the good numerical behavior of the system again makes the point that singular laplacian growth is _ not _ particularly sensitive to error or noise .",
    "its sensitivity to perturbations comes entirely through the non - uniqueness property . )",
    "most of those who have used the conformal mapping method have followed shraiman and bensimon @xcite in restricting the derivative of the conformal map @xmath24 to be a rational function . from some points of view",
    "this is a rather drastic restriction on the analytic structure of @xmath24 .",
    "whether it is a good enough representation of @xmath24 to learn the full implications of the conformal mapping method is not clear .",
    "arguments that the boundary value of @xmath93 can always be approximated by the boundary value of a rational function are not very convincing in a context where it is precisely the nature of the singularities which is the basis of the theory .",
    "it had already been noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite that branch points play an essential role in the singular theory .",
    "nonetheless , an interesting comparison between the singular case and the rational case is possible .",
    "an example is ref .",
    "@xcite , in which r. blumenfeld and r.c .",
    "ball invent a mechanism of `` particle creation '' ( i.e singularity creation ) to model tip splitting . in their model , since @xmath93 is rational , the only singularities are the zeros and poles of @xmath93 .",
    "the mechanism they propose is that a zero creates a second zero and a pole .",
    "the two zeros represent the two growing tips after the split , and the pole represents the division between them .    tip splitting in the singular theory , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite and in this paper , does not have to be invented  it is naturally and unavoidably part of the theory  and it looks slightly more complicated : a @xmath31 gives rise to three @xmath32 s and another @xmath31 ( as in figs . 1 and 2 ) .",
    "but in fact this amounts to the same thing .",
    "the resulting two @xmath31 s are zeros of @xmath93 , and , by the geometry of the situation , the three new @xmath34 s add to @xmath94 .",
    "this means that the three @xmath32 s , from a distance much greater than their mutual separation , look like a pole of @xmath93 ( see eq .",
    "( [ dhdz ] ) ) .",
    "the mechanism proposed by blumenfeld and ball is thus a kind of smeared version of the singular mechanism , already described in ref .",
    "@xcite    it is especially remarkable that blumenfeld and ball invented their mechanism entirely on the basis of physical phenomenology , and were unaware of ref .",
    "their mechanism of particle creation , although it is _ ad hoc _ , corresponds as precisely as it could have to the _ only _ mechanism in the singular theory for non - trivial dynamics .",
    "this suggests that the singular theory is close enough to real phenomenology to be useful , and that it does retain the essential features of laplacian growth .",
    "to focus on the details of singular laplacian growth is , to some extent , to sidestep a much bigger question : what is going on here with non - uniqueness ?",
    "are nt differential equation supposed to have unique solutions ?",
    "we all know textbook examples where uniqueness fails , but the failure occurs on some small set , and for equations which would nt arise in physics . here are equations which arise in a system which has been much discussed in physics , and uniqueness fails for every solution at every time .",
    "the least one can say is that the equations of motion do not determine the motion , even in the small .",
    "i believe this is actually mathematical _",
    "terra incognita_. such equations do not even have a name .",
    "how would one characterize them generally ?",
    "are they in some sense common , or are they rare ?",
    "i think of calling them `` fragile differential equations , '' because , at least in this example , the non - uniqueness arises by the tendency of singularities to `` break apart , '' but perhaps a more general understanding would reveal that this name is somehow misleading .",
    "`` fragile '' sounds a little bit like `` fractal , '' but is not the same , another reason i like the name .    on a more physical level , what does it mean for a physical system if it is described by equations which , in some limit , become `` fragile '' ?",
    "a fragile system does not fully determine the evolution , but it does restrict it . what is the nature of the restriction ?",
    "these seem like good questions for the future .",
    "we derive eqs . ( [ sing1])-([sing4 ] ) , the leading behavior of singularities @xmath95 , @xmath31 , @xmath96 when they are very close to each other ( in that order ) , and not close to other singularities .",
    "let @xmath87 and @xmath88 be the corresponding angle parameters , and @xmath97 the `` strength '' of @xmath31 . according to eqs .",
    "( [ dbetads])-([dgammads ] ) , keeping only the most singular terms , in leading order they obey @xmath98 let @xmath99 then , subtracting , @xmath100 dividing , we have the homogeneous equation @xmath101 which separates when written in terms of the variable @xmath102 . the complete solution , in implicit form , is @xmath103^{\\nu_2}=const.\\ ] ] where @xmath104 since this is supposed to hold as @xmath105 , @xmath106 approach zero , the only relevant value of the constant is zero .",
    "the solution @xmath107 is not relevant to this situation , since @xmath105 and @xmath106 must have opposite sign . thus @xmath108 using eqs .",
