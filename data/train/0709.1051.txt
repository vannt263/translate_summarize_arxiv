    ", we know that in this case we have an isomorphism @xmath640 where each @xmath218 is a system of hodge bundles . because the hodge numbers of @xmath641 are 1,9,9,1 , it is not difficult to see that , up to permutation of factors , the hodge numbers of @xmath642 are 1,1 , and those of @xmath643 are 1,8,1 . since @xmath642 comes from a @xmath644-pvhs , @xmath643 also comes from a @xmath644-pvhs .",

    "it is straightforward to check that the only possibility of case 2 is          note that case ( 1c ) is of non - hermitian type .",

    "we apply the method further in order to exclude the left two cases .",
