    "techniques of using the interactions between light and spin - waves to study the excitations of magnetic solids were developed shortly after the invention of the laser .",
    "single magnon scattering of photons was first predicted from the zeeman coupling of the magnetic field of the photon field to the magnetic spins , leading to magnetic dipole transitions.@xcite later it was pointed out @xcite that the electric field of the electromagnetic radiation could also couple to the spin , by an indirect process in which spin - orbit interactions act on electronic states excited virtually by electric - dipole transitions .",
    "experiments in antiferromagnets @xcite showed that this latter mechanism dominated the magnetic - dipole transitions to single magnon excitations .",
    "the raman spectrum also revealed relatively strong two - magnon scattering .",
    "this was argued @xcite to be due to an independent mechanism : excited - state exchange interactions .",
    "the same mechanism , by which the magnetic exchange interaction is modified by electric - dipole excitation of the magnetic electrons , was advanced @xcite to explain far - infrared absorption .",
    "a variant is to replace the virtual electronic excitation by a virtual lattice distortion that modifies the magnetic exchange.@xcite the intensities of such transitions can be calculated by writing effective operators for absorption or raman scattering in terms of the spin operators.@xcite this theory is considered generally to give good account of inelastic light scattering and optical absorption . for an isotropic system the effective operator conserves total spin and what is commonly called the `` fleury - loudon '' theory is used to analyse the spectroscopy of spin conserving transitions .",
    "optical techniques are now well established as probes of magnetic excitations , whether it be by raman scattering , i.e. inelastic scattering of optical frequencies , electron spin resonance ( esr ) , i.e. resonant absorption of electromagnetic radiation with sweeping magnetic field , or by transmission measurements of infrared radiation .",
    "the techniques have been further enhanced by the increasing flexibility of light sources and detectors in the far - infrared region that is useful to much of magnetism .",
    "esr studies using sources derived from far - infrared lasers rather than the traditional cavities are now available up to thz frequencies and may be made in large static or pulsed magnetic fields.@xcite transmission studies in the far infrared range have the advantage of allowing for measurement in zero external magnetic field . while restricted to small momentum transfer , @xmath3 , compared to neutron inelastic scattering , the optical techniques have the advantage of much higher frequency resolution .",
    "the possibility of polarising the electromagnetic radiation means different transition mechanisms may be distinguished .",
    "optical measurements are particularly useful for precise measurements of the spin gap properties in strongly correlated systems and spin - liquid systems with magnetic singlet ground states .",
    "because of the frequencies now available , one can apply an electromagnetic source with sufficient energy to excite the first triplet @xmath0 excited state from the singlet @xmath4 ground state .",
    "many systems of interest are highly isotropic with respect to spin rotations and transitions between the singlet @xmath4 ground state of the spin - liquid to the first triplet @xmath0 excited state would be forbidden by symmetry in the isotropic limit .",
    "even the weaker magnetic - dipole coupling should give zero intensity as the ground state is a spin singlet .",
    "one would then expect to see the excited singlets , i.e. two magnon states only .",
    "nonetheless the `` forbidden '' transitions to the single magnon states have been observed in many spin - liquid , ranging from the s=1/2 quasi - one - dimensional systems @xmath1 @xcite and @xmath5 @xcite , to 2d system such as @xmath2 @xcite and to the spin-1 chain compound , nenp @xcite . despite detailed experiments , no clear understanding of",
    "the mechanism of these transitions has emerged .",
    "it is clear that spin - orbit coupling , that breaks the conservation of total spin , must be included as it is then possible _ a priori _ to have a transition to a one - magnon state .",
    "as mentioned , the photon can couple to the spin degrees of freedom in different ways , via direct magnetic dipole transitions or indirect electric dipole transitions with spin - phonon or spin - orbit couplings .",
    "as one of the purposes of performing high resolution spectroscopy is to resolve the weak anisotropies , it is important to distinguish between these mechanisms , i.e. to find the one which gives the strongest absorption . as in the original studies @xcite this",
    "is done by establishing , and then verifying experimentally , selection rules . for one - magnon absorption ,",
    "previous estimations favored a purely electric dipole transition for nenp.@xcite in the case of @xmath1 the suggestion that a staggered field would give rise to a magnetic dipole transition @xcite has been ruled out by the polarized experiments.@xcite furthermore the first order corrections to the hamiltonian in spin - orbit coupling lead to vanishing magnetic dipole intensity owing to a lattice selection rule.@xcite in the compound @xmath2 it has been shown experimentally that varying the direction of the electric field of the wave ( while keeping the magnetic field of the wave fixed ) changes the intensity of the absorption , suggesting that the transition is electric - dipole in nature.@xcite one would also like to know which of the two electric dipole mechanisms applies , absorption involving solely the electronic degrees of freedom or with the lattice degrees of freedom . in the original theory of elliott and loudon of light scattering by magnons , the electric dipole coupling indeed leads to the creation of one - magnon excitations.@xcite although such two photon processes are not forbidden in infrared absorption , they are much smaller in intensity since they involve the weak coupling to light to second order in perturbation theory . alternatively in the presence of strong spin - orbit coupling , it is possible to have single photon coupling to spin excitations@xcite but as this is of second order in the spin - orbit coupling , we shall assume that the linear order will dominate for these materials , which are close to isotropic .",
    "in addition lattice symmetries such as centers of inversion between the magnetic ion may eliminate such terms , or at least reduce them further , if the inversion symmetry is slightly broken , as in @xmath2 .@xcite    in this paper we shall show that an effective operator of dzyaloshinski - moriya symmetry @xcite acting on the spin degrees of freedom ,    @xmath6    can be used to explain the polarized experiments of @xmath1 and @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath7 is the component @xmath8 of the applied electromagnetic field at time _",
    "t_. the indices _ i _ and _ a _ define the lattice of magnetic bonds and the coefficients @xmath9 will be made explicit in section [ effective operator ] .",
    "they couple the component @xmath8 of the electric field with the component @xmath10 of the vector product of the spin operators .",
    "an electric dipole operator ( 1 ) can arise from an electronic mechanism , as may be the case in nenp @xcite , but centers of inversion at the middle of the cu - cu bonds in @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite , would forbid generation of the operator from purely electronic processes .",
    "a lattice distortion may , however , break the inversion symmetry _ instantaneously _ , and allow terms of the form in ( 1 ) .",
    "we therefore consider the phonons explicitly , and in section [ effective operator ] we derive in detail the effective transition operator , which includes an anisotropic part of the form ( 1 ) .",
    "the essential physical mechanism is that the electric field excites a virtual phonon state @xmath4 which is coupled to the @xmath0 state by an anisotropic spin - phonon coupling which originates in spin - orbit coupling .",
    "an explanation involving the modulation of static dzyaloshinski - moriya interactions has been put forward recently for the case of @xmath5 .@xcite in that compound , however , no polarized experiments are available and moreover , it is difficult to distinguish with a magnetic dipole transition which turns out not to be forbidden by a lattice selection rule.@xcite the mechanism we develop here is more general in that it does not require the presence of a static dzyaloshinski - moriya interaction .",
    "it only needs the _ instantaneous _ breaking of the inversion center which is assured by the appropriate phonons .",
    "this allows us to consider the operator ( [ effectiveoperator ] ) on the strongest bonds irrespective of whether the bond lacks an inversion center or not . in section [ effective operator ] , we give the selection rules and the order of magnitude of such electric dipole transitions . we compare with the experiments in @xmath1 and @xmath11 in section [ application ] .",
    "in this section we show that the first - order spin - orbit correction to the spin - phonon coupling leads indeed to an effective magnetic operator for the optical transitions .",
    "we note that a phonon - assisted optical transition is the usual explanation for the occurrence of the singlet @xmath4 bound states of two magnon states in the spectrum of the high tc s cuprates.@xcite the spin - orbit correction should then lead to transition to @xmath0 states .",
    "we start with a magnetic hamiltonian for a chain or a layer of cu atoms , for instance , that can be motivated by the usual super - exchange arguments :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is a spin operator , @xmath14 is the displacement vector of the ion @xmath15 in the unit - cell @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the phonon hamiltonian which takes into account the kinetic part of the ions and the spring constants , @xmath18 is the electric dipole of the ions and @xmath19 is the external electric field .",
    "the magnetic couplings , @xmath20 , can be expanded to first order in the ion displacements . including the first order in spin - orbit coupling , there is an extra term of dzyaloshinski - moriya symmetry :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the partial derivative of the diagonal part of @xmath20 with respect to @xmath14 ( it depends on the bond @xmath23 but we will not write it explicitly in the following ) .",
    "the origin of @xmath24 is explained below .",
    "this is indeed a general form for the spin - phonon coupling and there is no restriction to be added on the grounds of symmetry .",
    "the static dzyaloshinski - moriya interaction is forbidden when there is an inversion center at the middle of the bond .",
    "if the set of displacements @xmath14 is such as to remove the inversion center ( which is the general case ) then such an interaction takes place .",
    "for example if we take the two symmetric ninety degrees super - exchange paths cu - o - cu , there is a center of inversion and there is an interference between the two paths that leads to no dzyaloshinski - moriya interaction .",
    "suppose now that the two oxygens move upwards . because the hopping of the electrons is much faster than the typical phonon frequency ,",
    "the electrons see a frozen distorted lattice on that time scale .",
    "the interference therefore does not occur anymore and there is an effective dzyaloshinski - moriya interaction linear in the displacements in the first order .",
    "this is the origin of the second term of ( [ spinphonon ] ) which involves a tensor @xmath25 since the displacements in one direction , @xmath26 , generally produce a dzyaloshinski - moriya vector in another direction , @xmath8 . strictly speaking",
    ", @xmath25 also depends upon the bond @xmath23 , but we do not write it explicitly . note that this term is derived in a super - exchange approach by taking into account the spin - orbit coupling in first - order in perturbation theory in the lines of the original moriya s article.@xcite we shall refer to it as a _ dynamical _ dzyaloshinski - moriya interaction in the following .",
    "the transition probability is then given at zero temperature by the `` golden rule '' :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the energy of the excitation , typically the one - magnon energy . at first order in @xmath29 in perturbation theory the matrix element is written in terms of a sum over the excited states :    @xmath30    the intermediate states that contribute to the sum over @xmath31 contain one phonon ( whereas the initial and final states we are interested in do not contain any phonon ) .",
    "the partial phonon matrix elements are calculated out , but we keep the general form for the magnetic states at this stage . in other words",
    "the phonons are integrated out and we end up with an effective matrix element acting between different magnetic states :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the amplitude of the instantaneous electric dipole of the unit cell due to the phonon mode @xmath34 with energy @xmath35 .",
    "the final magnetic state has an energy @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath36 is the amplitude of the variation of the magnetic exchange energy due the atomic distortions of the phonon @xmath34 ( @xmath37 is the amplitude of the motion of the atom @xmath15 , in the direction @xmath26 due to the phonon @xmath34 at @xmath38 ) .",
    "similarly , @xmath39 is the amplitude of the instantaneous dzyaloshinski - moriya vector due to the phonon @xmath34 .",
    "the resulting @xmath10 and @xmath40 depend on the bond considered .",
    "they would usually couple the nearest neighbors , but could be introduced for neighbors at larger distances if such super - exchange processes were likely to take place .",
    "they can be introduced on the basis of the symmetry which is usually reduced with respect to the crystal symmetry by the presence of the external electric field .",
    "thus we have written an effective operator announced in eq .",
    "[ effectiveoperator ] with @xmath41 .",
    "the selection rules are :    * \\(i ) @xmath42 : the virtual phonon @xmath34 creates distortions that carry an instantaneous electric dipole @xmath43 . in other words ,",
    "the phonon @xmath34 must be infra - red active . *",
    "( ii ) * * @xmath44 : the distortion of the unit cell due to the phonon @xmath34 modulates the magnetic exchange between the spins .",
    "the transition at @xmath45 is allowed . *",
    "* @xmath46 : it implies that the distortion of the unit cell due to the phonon @xmath34 must break instantaneously the symmetry by inversion at the middle of the bond ; so that to allow an instantaneous dzyaloshinski - moriya interaction which amplitude is given by @xmath47 .",
    "the transitions between states that differ by the spin , @xmath48 , are allowed and have an intensity @xmath49 .",
    "suppose that there is only one phonon mode @xmath34 which gives a major contribution to the sum .",
    "in addition , we know that this active phonon mode will appear in the infrared spectrum at the energy @xmath50 , with an intensity given by @xmath51 . we can therefore rewrite the intensity of the @xmath48 line as :    @xmath52 ^ 2 i_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize{ph , s } } } \\label{probabilite dipolaire electrique estimation 1}\\ ] ]    we denote by @xmath53 the order of magnitude of the variation of the magnetic exchange energy due to the phonon and following moriya,@xcite we estimate @xmath54 .",
    "that gives :    @xmath55 ^ 2 i_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize{ph , s } } } \\label{probabilite dipolaire electrique estimation 2}\\ ] ]    this expression gives the intensity of such a process compared to the intensity of the optically active phonon .",
    "it is reduced by two factors : the spin - orbit coupling ( in the cuprate materials , @xmath56 can be @xmath57 ) and the ratio of the energy modulation of the magnetic exchange due to the phonon by roughly the energy of the same phonon .",
    "the latter is difficult to estimate : in @xmath1 , the first optical phonons have @xmath58 , and the modulation can be as large as @xmath59.@xcite that gives @xmath60 .",
    "another way to compare with is to consider that singlet excited states , as for example the @xmath61 bound - state below the continuum in @xmath1 , appear in the optical spectrum due to the isotropic spin - phonon coupling ( the @xmath10 term ) .",
    "we denote their intensity by @xmath62 .",
    "then we have : @xmath63 .",
    "it means that if the singlet bound - state appears in the optical spectrum with an intensity @xmath62 due to the isotropic spin - phonon coupling , the triplet states should also appear with an intensity which is roughly 100 times smaller , if moriya s estimate applies .",
    "_ effect of a magnetic field_. we consider a basic triplet excitation here .",
    "a magnetic field lifts the degeneracy of the triplet into three branches .",
    "when @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) , @xmath66 is a good quantum number and the transition should satisfy @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , only the mode @xmath68 could be observed and its intensity does not depend on the strength of the field .",
    "by contrast , when the magnetic field is perpendicular to @xmath40 , the wave - function is a superposition of wave - functions with different @xmath66 :    @xmath69    where the vector notation stands for @xmath70 .",
    "the transition is allowed to the states @xmath71 with quantum numbers @xmath72 and the mode which energy does not depend on the field has no intensity .",
    "the magnetic field dependence is therefore very different from what is expected for magnetic dipole transitions.@xcite this is basically because the electric field conserves the @xmath66 quantum number . as we have just seen , however , in transverse magnetic field , @xmath66 is no longer conserved and the magnetic field - dependent branches may appear in the optical spectrum .",
    "they do indeed appear in @xmath1 .@xcite    we now compare the intensities of the magnetic dipole transitions with those of the electric dipole transitions that we have made explicit here .",
    "to make such a comparison , we consider the following two models that give intensity to the optical transitions . first a purely magnetic model and magnetic dipole transitions . in order to have an intensity , we need to add a static magnetic anisotropy , such as a dzyaloshinski - moriya interaction or an anisotropy in the @xmath73 factor , which are both first order in the spin - orbit coupling , so that in the most favourable case ( when no lattice selection rule forbids it ) , the matrix element is of order @xmath74 at best . in the second model , we consider an isotropic magnetic model , but we add the anisotropic spin - phonon coupling that we have considered above .",
    "the intensities of the transitions of the two models are given by :    @xmath75 ^ 2 \\left ( \\frac{\\delta g}{g } \\right)^2 \\\\ i_e & = & \\mid \\langle f | \\textbf{\\mbox{d}}. \\textbf{\\mbox{e } } \\mid 0 \\rangle \\mid^2   \\sim   \\left ( \\frac{\\delta g}{g } \\right)^2   \\left(\\frac { \\omega_s e}{\\omega_f^2 - \\omega_s^2}\\right)^2 ( \\textbf{\\mbox{d}}_s.\\textbf{\\mbox{e}})^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    so that the ratio is :    @xmath76    where @xmath77 , @xmath78 is the speed of light .",
    "@xmath79 is given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the amplitude of the motion of the ion and @xmath82 is its charge .",
    "@xmath83    with @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) , @xmath86 , we find @xmath87",
    ". @xmath88 .",
    "we take @xmath89 for the energy of the magnetic mode and @xmath90 for the spin - phonon coupling .",
    "this estimation has to be taken with a pinch of salt because of the the crude order of magnitude given above , but it shows that there is no particular reason to not consider the electric dipole transition due to dynamical dzyaloshinski - moriya interaction .",
    "we compare the selection rules derived above with the experimental observation in @xmath1 .",
    "experimentally , the absorption has been observed in the configuration @xmath91 but an extinction has been reported for @xmath92,@xcite even in the presence of a magnetic field.@xcite    we have a natural interpretation of this fact : when @xmath93 , the only contributions to @xmath40 come from the virtual phonons @xmath34 that have @xmath94 , or , in other words , the virtual phonons involved are those which are optically active in this configuration .",
    "the vector @xmath40 is given by @xmath95 where @xmath96 are the displacements of the atoms , the same as those that appear at higher energy in the real phonon state @xmath34 .",
    "in the configuration @xmath92 , the atoms in the phonon state @xmath34 roughly move along the @xmath78-axis . in a crystal with many atoms per unit cell ,",
    "this is not exactly true and the displacements will acquire other components ( a full study of the phonons that have been theoretically predicted in ref . does not change the picture ) .",
    "then , according to the figure [ d ] , the dynamical dzyaloshinski - moriya interaction is forbidden @xmath97 because of the mirror plane containing the atoms and the mirror plane perpendicular to the previous plane and containing the cu atoms .",
    "therefore , the intensity vanishes in this special configuration .",
    "in other configurations , however , there is no such symmetry arguments leading to a cancellation of the dynamical dzyaloshinski - moriya interaction , and an intensity is expected in agreement with the experiment performed in @xmath1 .",
    "we now consider the electric dipole transitions in @xmath11 in greater detail . the obvious advantage of this compound is that , neglecting anisotropies , it is described by the shastry - sutherland@xcite hamiltonian that possesses an exactly known ground state as a product of local singlets.@xcite optical transitions have been observed between this ground state and each of the zero - field three - split triplet states @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ excitationspectrum ] ) that have been described previously.@xcite the probability of a transition between the ground state @xmath98 and an excited state @xmath99 is given by :    @xmath100    we have restricted the operator @xmath101 to the nearest neighbor spins ( nn ) in order to find the largest effect . the first part of it does not change the total spin but may generate transitions to the first excited states if the system has some anisotropy .",
    "we have considered previously the existence of a dzyaloshinski - moriya interaction whose vector is perpendicular to the plane.@xcite we have shown that such first - order anisotropy does not give intensity within the assumption of magnetic dipole transitions .",
    "here we start by considering the electric dipole transitions generated by the first part of the operator ( [ general pattern0 ] ) and in presence of the static dzyaloshinski - moriya interaction . using a symmetry argument",
    "we show that this part actually vanishes .",
    "@xmath66 is a conserved quantity so that we only need to consider the matrix elements with a @xmath68 final state .",
    "the symmetry by the mirror plane perpendicular to the ( ab ) plane and passing through a dimer is a symmetry of the crystal . in this symmetry ,",
    "the ground state and the operator @xmath102 are both even .",
    "however the triplet state @xmath68 adiabatically connected to the local triplet at @xmath103 ( the next nearest neighbor exchange ) is odd . then the matrix element vanishes .",
    "additional spin anisotropy of the dzyaloshinski - moriya symmetry with extra in - plane components is present because of the small buckling of the crystal structure at low temperatures.@xcite however , this ( together with possible exchange anisotropies ) would , in any case , respect the same mirror - plane symmetry .",
    "so the first term is not expected to give intensity , because of this special symmetry .    in @xmath2 ,",
    "the transitions have been studied using polarized electromagnetic waves and exhibit very peculiar polarisation properties : in the configuration @xmath104 , at zero field , only the state at 24.2@xmath105 ( i.e. the @xmath68 state [ the middle state ] ) appears in the spectrum , but an external in - plane magnetic field gives intensity in the two other modes ( upper and lower modes).@xcite similarly when the magnetic field lies in the @xmath106 plane , only the upper state at 25.4@xmath105 ( i.e. the @xmath107 ) appears at zero magnetic field while an in - plane magnetic field allows observation of the middle state , but not the lower one .",
    "@xcite    we now show that these observations are compatible with the dynamical dzyaloshinski - moriya interaction which leads to the second part of the effective operator ( [ effectiveoperator ] ) .",
    "to explain these results we need to find the particular pattern of _ dynamical _ dzyaloshinski - moriya vectors and then the @xmath108 . that crucially depends on the direction of the electric field of the wave , according to eq .",

    "we basically assume that the main displacements of the atoms in such a virtual phonon mode are confined into the ( ab ) plane .",
    "we make the assumption that the main components of @xmath112 are parallel to the electric field , so that we should be able to find the main components of the dzyaloshinski - moriya vectors @xmath113 ( eq . [ delta ] ) . to estimate them ( and then @xmath108 ) , we fix the atoms @xmath15 at the distorted positions @xmath112 and we then apply the moriya s rules which give the constraints on the dzyaloshinski - moriya vectors . in this case ,",
    "the plane remains instantaneously an approximate mirror plane for the crystal structure .",
    "subsequently , the instantaneous @xmath15-vector between the spins , generated by the distortions , should be perpendicular to this plane ( parallel to the @xmath78-axis ) .",

    "furthermore , we calculate the intensities as a function of a transverse magnetic field . the excited states @xmath121 and @xmath154 are twice degenerate , so we calculate :    @xmath155    we find the following expressions for the intensity of the upper ( + ) , lower ( - ) and middle ( 0 ) states :    @xmath156 \\left[\\pm \\sqrt{1 + h^2}-1\\right]^2 } \\label{ieparc1 } \\\\ i^{0}_{e \\parallel c}(h_{\\perp } ) & = & \\frac{\\delta^2}{4 } \\frac{h^2}{1+h^2 }   \\label{ieparc2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath126 .",
    "the corresponding curves are given in the figure [ transitions optiques sous champ magnetique1 ] .",
    "note that the crossing between @xmath157 and @xmath158 occurs at @xmath159 , therefore at a field two times larger than in the configuration @xmath104 .",
    "the agreement with the experiment is very good since such a balance of the intensities has been observed.@xcite the lower mode does not actually appears in the spectrum experimentally and this is compatible with the low intensity we found . if we take the non - renormalized value of @xmath129 , the crossing of the intensities occur at @xmath160 which is in good agreement with the experimental value ( @xmath161 ) , as well as the overall behavior of the curves .",
    "in this paper , we have considered optical transitions with emission of one magnetic excitation , @xmath48 .",
    "we give a mechanism in terms of phonon - assisted transitions in which a virtual phonon is involved .",
    "the selection rules of such processes were made explicit : in brief we need a coupling to an infrared active phonon that breaks , at least instantaneously , the symmetry of inversion between magnetically coupled ions .",
    "the intensity of such a process has been estimated and we argue that it should be larger than a magnetic - dipole transition , at least in systems in which spin - phonon couplings are appreciable .",
    "it provides an alternative to purely electronic transitions that are not allowed when an inversion center is present .",
    "we note that we have considered uniquely the consequences of phonon assisted optical transitions in the context of single - phonon experiments , i.e. esr and absorption .",
    "the same mechanism can lead to processes in raman scattering allowing single magnon creation , with similar selection rules concerning centers of inversion in the lattice .",
    "the effective operators will have similar symmetry but are not identical , involving the polarisations of both incoming and outgoing photons .",
    "experimentally there are extra contributions linear in both spin operators and spin - orbit couplings that are not present in the single photon case .",
    "while for the spectroscopy of single magnons in the materials studied , raman scattering should be useful , single photon experiments may permit more direct comparison with microscopic estimates of intensities .    in the final section",
    "we have studied the two specific case of @xmath1 and @xmath2 for which polarised experiments are available .",
    "we have shown that predictions of the phonon - assisted theory agrees well both with observed extinctions and also , for the case of @xmath2 where detailed results are available , with the dependence of intensities as function of the external magnetic field .",
    "further optical data should be analysed in terms of an effective operator of the dzyaloshinski - moriya symmetry for the matrix elements in the electric dipole approximation .",
    "potentially such optical experiments can provide a means of probing microscopically the spin - phonon coupling which may be relevant to other experiments , for example neutron inelastic scattering experiments at finite momentum transfer , and a way of studying four - spin correlation functions involving some sort of local chiralities .",
