    "random variables .    the spectral theory of such models has been studied extensively ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and it is well known that , when considered on @xmath5 , the spectrum of @xmath6 is purely absolutely continuous when @xmath1 is periodic ( @xcite ) while it is pure point when @xmath4 is the anderson potential ( @xcite ) .",
    "on @xmath0 , the picture is the same except for possible discrete eigenvalues outside the essential spectrum which coincides and is of the same nature as the essential spectrum of the operator on @xmath5 .",
    "+ let @xmath7 .",
    "the object of our study is the following operator on @xmath0 @xmath8 when @xmath9 becomes large ; here @xmath10 is the free lapalce operator defined by @xmath11 for @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( dirichlet boundary condition at @xmath3 ) .",
    "+ clearly , the essential spectrum of @xmath15 is that of the discrete laplace operator , that is , @xmath16 $ ] , and it is absolutely continuous .",
    "moreover , outside this absolutely continuous spectrum , @xmath15 has only discrete eigenvalues associated to exponentially decaying eigenfunctions .",
    "+ we are interested in the resonances of the operator @xmath15 . these can be defined as the poles of the meromorphic continuation of the resolvent of @xmath15 through the continuous spectrum of @xmath15 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "one proves that    [ thr:1 ] the operator valued holomorphic function @xmath17 admits a meromorphic continuation from @xmath18 to @xmath19\\cup[2,+\\infty)\\right)$ ] ( see fig .",

    "+ moreover , the number of poles of this meromorphic continuation in the lower half - plane is equal to @xmath22 .",
    "as said , we define the resonances as the poles of this meromorphic continuation .",
    "the resonance widths , the imaginary part of the resonances , play an important role in the large time behavior of @xmath23 , especially the smallest width that gives the leading order contribution ( see  @xcite ) .     and the analytic continuation of @xmath24,title=\"fig:\",height=56 ]   and the analytic continuation of @xmath24,title=\"fig:\",height=56 ]    as @xmath25",
    ", @xmath15 converges to @xmath6 in the strong resolvent sense .",
    "thus , it is natural to expect that the differences in the spectral nature between the cases @xmath1 periodic and @xmath1 random should reflect into differences in the behavior of the resonances .",
    "as we shall see , this is the case .",
    "+ our goal is to describe the resonances or , rather , their statistical properties and relate them ( the distribution of the resonances , the distribution of the widths ) to the spectral characteristics of @xmath2 . in the periodic case , we expect that the bloch - floquet data for the operator @xmath26 on @xmath27 will be of importance ; in the random case , this role should be taken over by the distribution of the eigenvalues of @xmath28 .. 2cmthe scattering theory or the closely related study of resonances for the operator   or for similar one - dimensional models has already been discussed in various works both in the mathematical and physical literature  @xcite .",
    "the proofs of the result we present below will be released elsewhere ( @xcite ) .",
    "though we will restrict ourselves to the discrete model , the continuous model can be dealt with in a very similar way ..",
    "2cmlet us now describe our results .",
