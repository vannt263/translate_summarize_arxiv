    "two fundamental models of quantum mechanics , presented in most introductory textbooks , are the two - level system and the harmonic oscillator . combining these",
    "two into a bipartite system gives many interesting models , where two of the more studied ones are the jaynes - cummings ( jc ) model @xcite and the rabi model @xcite .",
    "the jc model was introduced for describing the interaction between a two - level atom and a quantized electromagnetic ( em ) field , while the rabi model was introduced for nmr systems . in this paper",
    "we will use the terminology of the jc model , a two - level atom and a quantized em field , which , of course , does not restrict the results to such systems .",
    "the jc hamiltonian is obtained from the rabi one by simply imposing the rotating wave approximation rwa @xcite .",
    "there are , however , special cases where atomic selection rules make the jc model exact ; the rwa terms naturally vanish @xcite . in this approximation ,",
    "exact analytical solutions exist , and , in spite the simplicity of the jc model , the dynamics have turned out to be very rich and complex , describing several physical phenomena .",
    "among these are ; rabi oscillations @xcite , collapse - revivals @xcite , squeezing @xcite , atom - field entanglement @xcite , non - classical states as schrdinger cats @xcite and fock states @xcite and anti - bunching @xcite . the jc model originally thought of as a single atom , single field mode interaction , has shown to be applicable for several other types of systems , for example , trapped ions @xcite , cooper - pair boxes @xcite , `` flux '' qubits @xcite and josephson - junctions @xcite . with the experimental progress of some of the above mentioned systems",
    ", the coupling between the systems may be made very large , and the rwa breaks down so that only the rabi model describes the dynamics correctly .",
    "as the number of excitations , field plus atom , is a constant of motion in the jc model , there are only two physically relevant parameters ; detuning @xmath0 between the atomic transition frequency @xmath1 and the field mode frequency @xmath2 and atom - field coupling @xmath3 . in the rabi model , however , the number of excitations is not conserved and all three parameters are of importance . in general , the rwa is justified for small detunings @xmath4 and small ratios of the atom - field coupling divided by the atomic transition frequency , @xmath5 . in atom - field cavity systems , this ratio is typically of the order @xmath6 , @xcite .",
    "recently , cavity systems with very strong couplings have been discussed @xcite .",
    "the ratio may also become order of magnitudes larger in solid state systems @xcite , and the full rabi hamiltonian , including the _ virtual processes _",
    "( also caller _ counter - rotating terms _ ) , must be considered .",
    "the neglection of the counter - rotating terms may have interesting physical consequencies on nonlocality and causality @xcite .",
    "the effect of the rwa in other systems has been studied , and to mention a few , trapping of atoms by light @xcite , driven rabi model @xcite , multi - level atoms and/or fields @xcite , the micromaser @xcite semiclassical rabi models @xcite , transition between vibrational states in a water molecule @xcite , dipolar molecules @xcite , light - matter interaction @xcite , electromagnetically and self induced transparency @xcite and laser modified collisions @xcite .",
    "existence of analytical solutions for special cases of the rabi model has been discussed @xcite . as no general simple solutions",
    "are known , much work has been devoted to various analytical approximate or numerical approaches , such as ; perturbation theory @xcite , path - integrals @xcite , continued fractions @xcite , variational methods @xcite , coupled cluster methods @xcite , displaced oscillators @xcite , approximated unitary transformed rabi hamiltonians @xcite and numerical studies @xcite .",
    "the time - dependent rabi hamiltonian has been considered in @xcite , and a particular equivalence relation between the time - dependent jc and rabi models was obtained .",
    "interestingly , the rabi model has shown to be chaotic @xcite , contrary to the jc model @xcite .",
    "the bargmann representation @xcite , similar to our approach , has been considered for both the jc @xcite and the rabi model @xcite .    using a different approach than the standard ones we discuss and review some of the work that has been done previously on the two models .",
    "the method used in this paper is a numerical wave packet propagation , which has been briefly applied to the rabi model before @xcite , but to the best of our knowledge not to the jc model .",
    "the system hamiltonians are usually represented in the field creation and annihilation operators @xmath7 and @xmath8 , but here we instead work with the field quadrature operators @xmath9 and @xmath10 . as these obey the standard canonical commutation relations , the system is equivalent to a particle , with unit mass , moving in two coupled potentials , and the dynamics is given by the evolution of some initial wave packet .",
    "the idea of this paper is to give a deeper understanding of the jc and rabi models by consider the wave packets evolving on these potential curves .",
    "since the jc model is exactly solvable , it might seem unmotivated to use this numerical study .",
    "however , from the wave packet picture it is easy to understand some of the systems behaviours , and , additionally , due to the `` graininess '' of the cavity field most analytically obtained quantities predicted by the jc model are given as infinite sums lacking closed forms .",
    "as in related problems in molecular physics @xcite , it is often convenient to investigate the system in the _ diabatic _ or _ adiabatic _ basis @xcite .",
    "the proper basis used , depends on the system parameters and initial state .",
    "the critical evolution takes place close to _ level crossings _ between the two energy curves , and such a level crossing exists in both the jc and rabi model .",
    "the two energy curves are given , in both models , by two displaced harmonic oscillators , and they are coupled by a constant coupling in both cases , while in the jc model there is an additional `` momentum '' @xmath9 dependent coupling which gives rise to very different dynamics .",
    "the presence of the @xmath9 dependent coupling makes the wave packet evolution of the jc model less intuitive and more complex . comparing the two models , combined with the knowledge of the validity regime of the rwa , one may interpret the consequences of this coupling term as well as other effects . in the intermediate regime ,",
    "when one is neither in the adiabatic nor the diabatic validity regimes , a more detailed analysis is needed to understand the full evolution .",
    "this is only briefly mentioned in this paper .",
    "the paper proceeds as the following . in the next section [ sec2 ]",
    "we introduce the jc and rabi hamiltonians in their regular forms and also give them in the conjugate variable picture . in subsection [ sslz ]",
    "the corresponding curve crossing problem is mentioned and how to approximate it as a landau - zener problem @xcite .",
    "the following section [ sec3 ] , presents a background of an adiabatic approach , the two different bases , diabatic and adiabatic , are defined , and the approach is applied to both the jc and rabi model . the validity of the adiabatic method is numerically studied in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] using the split operator procedure to calculate the fidelity . in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] we present the numerical results of our studies .",
    "several plots are shown to give a deeper insight of the dynamics and the phenomena are discussed from a wave packet point of view .",
    "known interesting effects , such as entanglement , collapse - revivals , squeezing and rabi oscillations , are especially studied .",
    "finally we conclude the paper in sec .",
    "[ conc ] with a summery .",
    "the simplest fully quantum mechanical model describing light - matter interaction , naturally considers one atom , with a single atomic transition , interacting with only one mode of the field .",
    "such an approach leads to the jc or rabi models .",
    "the single atom transition and single mode approximation relies on small or vanishing coupling elements between other levels @xcite .",
    "thus , mathematically one is left with a two - level atom ( spin-1/2 particle ) coupled to a harmonic oscillator . for a dipole interaction , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the atomic dipole moment and electric field respectively ,",
    "a microscopic derivation @xcite gives the rabi hamiltonian @xmath14 here , @xmath7",
    "( @xmath8 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for the field mode ; @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) , the sigma operators are the standard pauli matrices acting on the two - level atom ; @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath2 ( @xmath1 ) is the field ( atomic transition ) frequency and @xmath3 is the effective atom - field coupling . in deriving ( [ hrabi ] ) ,",
    "the dipole approximation has been assumed , where the variation of the field is neglected on the atomic length scale , and the kinetic energy of the atom is omitted , valid for large and moderate temperatures @xcite .",
    "the interaction part contains four terms ; @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) simultaneous excitation ( de - excitation ) of the atom and field , and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) excitation of the atom by absorption of one photon ( de - excitation of the atom by emission of one photon ) . in the heisenberg picture , the operators evolve ( free field and free atom case ) as : @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "thus , the interaction terms precess with either the frequencies @xmath28 ( energy conserving terms ) or @xmath29 ( non energy conserving / counter rotating terms )",
    ". most often @xmath30 and the fast oscillating terms are rejected from the hamiltonian , resulting in the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian @xmath31 however , for a large atom - field detuing ( but still within the atomic two - level and single mode approximations ) , the above constrain may be violated and the non energy conserving terms can not be excluded . as mentioned in the introduction , also the ratio @xmath5 is important for the validity of the above rwa .",
    "the two conditions for the rwa must in general be met simultaneously , meaning that near resonant interaction does not gurantee validity of the rwa if not @xmath32 , and vice versa .",
    "the jc model is usually given and solved within the `` number''-basis of the field @xmath33 . here",
    ", however , we will work in the conjugate variable basis of the field .",
    "we introduce the conjugate variables @xmath9 and @xmath10 related to the creation / annihilation operators as @xmath34 in the transformed basis the rabi ( [ hrabi ] ) and the jc ( [ hjc0 ] ) hamiltonians read @xmath35},\\ ] ]    @xmath36}. \\end{array}\\ ] ]    relating @xmath9 and @xmath10 as momentum and position operators respectively , the above hamiltonians can be interpreted as a two - level particle , with quantized position and momentum , confined in a harmonic trap and interacting with a `` classical '' field with mode `` variations '' @xmath37 or @xmath38 .",
    "the rabi hamiltonian could be obtained , for example , by considering a harmonically trapped two - level atom driven by a classical field , whose wave length is much longer than the extent of the atomic wave packet in the trap and with a node at the centre @xmath39 . in other words",
    ", there is a direct connection between the above example of a trapped atom and an atom interacting with a quantized field .",
    "relating the jc hamiltonian to similar systems is less trivial , since the atom - field coupling is momentum dependent .",
    "the structure of the rabi hamiltonian ( [ conrabi ] ) is more easily seen by applying the unitary transformation @xmath40 , giving the transformed hamiltonian @xmath41 . \\end{array}\\ ] ] by completing the squares we may write the hamiltonian as @xmath42-\\frac { \\hbar g_0 ^ 2}{\\omega},\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the regular harmonic oscillator potential . thus , it is seen that the problem is equivalent to the one of a particle moving in two coupled equally , but opposite , displaced harmonic potential curves .",
    "the two energy curves cross for @xmath39 , and the off diagonal coupling @xmath44 results in an avoided crossing . as is well known ; the main population transfer between two levels occurs close to the crossing . here",
    "the distance between the curves relative to the coupling amplitude is the smallest .",
    "therefor , in some situations the coupled dynamics may be considered only in the vicinity of the crossing . by linearizing the model around @xmath39",

    ", the hamiltonian reduces to the one of the landau - zener model @xcite @xmath50,\\ ] ] where the classical velocity @xmath51 will , of course , depend on the initial state of the system .",
    "the time dependent problem given by the hamiltonian ( [ lzham ] ) is analytically solvable , with asymptotic solution for the population transfer to the other level given by @xmath52 the validity of this semiclassical model may be studied in a detailed way similar to the one in @xcite .",
    "the same procedure may be applied to the jc hamiltonian ( [ conjc ] ) ; @xmath53\\!-\\!\\frac { \\hbar g_0 ^ 2}{4\\omega}.\\ ] ] one notes that the displaced oscillators are shifted half the amount as in the rabi hamiltonian , and that there is an additional @xmath9-dependent coupling of the oscillators .",
    "as the rwa implies that non energy conserving terms are omitted , it follows that the number of excitations is conserved .",
    "thus , @xmath54 commutes with @xmath55 , and one may work in a rotating frame with respect to @xmath56 .",

    "an interesting observation is that if the wave packet approaches the curve crossing with a high momentum , an adiabatic evolution is still possible due to the large curve couplings . at the one hand",
    ", `` velocity '' determines the steepness of the crossing curves , but on the other is also determines level separation close to the coupling .",
    "this peculiar curve crossing model is , of course , an artifact of the rwa , but none the less it may give insight into other related systems , for example atomic and molecular scattering processes @xcite .",
    "the concept of adiabaticity is widely used in a variety of physical and chemical systems , while , what is known as the adiabatic theorem @xcite is _ only _ stated for time - dependent hamiltonian systems .",

    "<S> by using a wave packet approach , this paper reviews the jaynes - cummings model with and without the rotating wave approximation in a non - standard way . </S>",
    "<S> this gives new insight , not only of the two models themself , but of the rotating wave approximation as well . </S>",
    "<S> expressing the models by field quadrature operators , instead of the typically used boson ladder operators , wave packet simulations are presented . </S>",
    "<S> several known phenomena of these systems , such as collapse - rivivals , rabi oscillation , squeezing and entanglement , are reviewed and explained in this new picture , either in an adiabatic or diabatic frame . </S>",
    "<S> the harmonic shape of the potential curves that the wave packets evolve on and the existance of a level crossing make these results interesting in a broader sense than only for models in quantum optics , especially in atomic and molecular physics . </S>"
