    "it was almost ten years ago that the atmospheric neutrino anomaly@xcite could be explained by the oscillations of muon neutrinos into tau neutrinos @xcite .",
    "this interpretation has been confirmed by the observation of the zenith angle dependence of the neutrino fluxes by the superkamiokande@xcite .",
    "while the zenith angle dependence of the electron - like events is consistent with the theoretical predictions@xcite@xcite , that of the muon - like events disagree with the theory , especially for the up - going events .    the neutrino state with flavor basis and that of mass basis is related to each other by the mixing matrix as follows , @xmath2 where @xmath3 the super - kamiokande shows that @xmath4 the equation ( [ eq : mu - tau_osc ] ) means that @xmath5 which is consistent with the choos results@xcite .",
    "once the the matter enhanced neutrino oscillations was proposed @xcite , it has soon been applied to the atmospheric neutrinos crossing the earth@xcite .",
    "recently much attention@xcite has been devoted to this subject .",
    "however , it seems that no systmatic study has not been made yet , especially for the three flavor model of neutrinos .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to reveal the conditions that amplify the effect of @xmath1 through matter oscillations so that we can determine this small mixing angle .",
    "i assume that the masses of neutrinos are hierarchical , namely , @xmath6 @xmath7 , furthermore i assume that the solar neutrino oscillations are attributed to @xmath8 .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino oscillations are derived by @xmath9 @xmath10 , the value of which is @xmath11 .",
    "the solar neutrino problem may be solved by the matter enhanced , or just so oscillations . in either case",
    ", @xmath12 is much smaller than @xmath13 , and irrelevant to our concerns . in the following , we assign @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "the parameters contained in the model are @xmath16 , @xmath1 , and @xmath17 .",
    "in calculating the matter effect of the earth , i use the density profile given by the `` preliminary reference earth model''(prem)@xcite .",
    "the prominent feature of our model is that the survival probability of electron neutrinos @xmath18 is completely determined by the three parameters , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath1 , @xmath0 where @xmath19 is the neutrino energy , and the zenith angle @xmath20 .",
    "it is natural to define the resonance condition as @xmath21 the resonance states form curves in the the three parameter space @xmath22 @xmath23 corresponding to discretization of the resonance wavelength .",
    "i solve eq.([eq : resonance ] ) numerically , and show in fig.1 and fig.2 the values of the three parameters at the resonance . fig.1 and",
    "fig.2 correspond to the longest and the second longest wavelength , respectively .",
    "the other probabilities @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 @xmath28 also depend on the @xmath29 mixing angle @xmath16 .",
    "i have investigated the resonance conditions of neutrinos passing through the earth in a wide range of parameters , although only a small mixing angle @xmath30 has a practical meaning as has been suggested by the choos experiments .",
    "the results show that it is necessary to observe the high energy electron neutrinos crossing the depth of the earth to investgate the small mixing angle @xmath1 .",
    "for example , the resonance occurs at @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "the energy of electron neutrino is @xmath34 if @xmath35 .",
    "this indicates the need to assemble the data of the zenith angle distribution of the electron neutrinos whose energy is of order @xmath34 in order to determine the lepton mixing angle @xmath1 .",
