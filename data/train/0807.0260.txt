    "advances over the past decade show that it is possible to enhance @xmath0 in nanostructured thin - film systems by taking advantage of quantum confinement to enhance the power factor @xmath7@xcite or to increase phonon scattering at interfaces to reduce the lattice contribution to @xmath5.@xcite on the other hand , many existing and envisioned thermoelectric applications will require a material that is itself of macroscopic dimension .",
    "therefore , recent reports of property enhancement in bulk alloys possessing nanometer - scale compositional modulations have generated much excitement .",
    "@xcite @xmath0 values as high as 2.2 have been reported @xcite in the ( pbte)@xmath8(agsbte@xmath9)@xmath10 system , and have been ascribed to a large seebeck coefficient and low lattice thermal conductivity due to nanoscale clustering of ag and sb .",
    "heremans et al .",
    "@xcite reported that the seebeck coefficient in bulk pbte can be increased significantly by precipitating a fine distribution of pb nanoinclusions , and suggested heuristically that the increase in seebeck coefficient originates from an energy - filtering effect due to a strongly energy - dependent electronic scattering time .",
    "kim et al.@xcite observed an enhancement of the thermoelectric properties when eras nanoparticles of 2.4 nm average diameter were embedded in a ingaas matrix , and ascribed the increase to a reduction in the phonon thermal conductivity .",
    "given these observations , a general understanding of the role of nanoinclusions in enhancing the thermoelectric properties of materials is needed , in particular to assess the relative importance of electronic and phonon scattering .",
    "in this paper we present a theoretical model and numerical calculations of the thermoelectric properties of bulk semiconductors containing metallic nanoparticles .",
    "our model considers scattering of electrons on the band - bending at the interfaces between the semiconductor host and randomly distributed metallic islands .",
    "this causes energy - dependent scattering of electrons , leading to an energy filterting effect that increases the seebeck coefficient .",
    "this provides an explicit physical model for the proposed energy filtering effect.@xcite by combining this model with a model for phonon scattering on the nanoinclusions , we predict significant enhancement of the zt factor .",
    "we point out that while the role of metallic nanoinclusions may appear at first to be similar to that of point defects for which extensive work has been done , the physics is actually quite different .",
    "indeed , in addition to the electronic scattering , the phonon scattering on nanoinclusions occurs in a completely different regime than that on point defects , as will be discussed in section ivb .    the central idea in this paper",
    "is illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "there , spherical metallic nanoinclusions with radius @xmath11 and volume fraction @xmath12 are randomly distributed in a bulk semiconductor material . in general , at such metal / semiconductor interfaces , charge transfer between the metal and the semiconductor leads to band - bending away from the interface , characterized by the electrostatic potential @xmath13 ( fig .",
    "the presence of this potential causes _ energy - dependent _ scattering of electrons , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the high - energy electrons are unaffected by the potential , but the low energy electrons can be strongly scattered . because the seebeck coefficient depends on the energy derivative of the relaxation time @xmath14 at the fermi energy ,",
    "this type of energy filtering is precisely the prescription to increase the seebeck coefficient of thermoelectric materials .",
    "our theoretical model is based on the boltzmann transport equation ( bte ) within the relaxation time approximation .",

    ", the electronic thermal conductivity is already quite low , @xmath256 , and the main impact of nanoinclusions is to decrease the phonon thermal conductivity .",
    "the maximum increase in @xmath0 is @xmath257 , with @xmath258 coming from phonons alone .",
    "in fact , for this low doping , the power factor is always reduced compared to the inclusion - free system  a signature of this effect is the reduction of @xmath0 below that of the inclusion - free system for larger values of @xmath84 .    fig .",
    "6 shows the calculated @xmath0 as a function of temperature for low ( @xmath259 ) and high ( @xmath260 ) doping levels .",
    "included in the figure are the @xmath0 factor calculated with both electron and phonon scattering on nanoinclusions ( filled circles ) , that calculated with ` electron - only ' scattering on nanoinclusions and with bulk pbte values of @xmath218 ( open circles ) ,  and the @xmath0 calculated for inclusion - free bulk pbte ( solid line ) .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath84 that maximize @xmath0 are shown in the insets by filled circles .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "6a shows that at @xmath261 the optimal @xmath84 is very small @xmath262 and even vanishes for @xmath263 .",
    "thus , the electron contribution to enhancement of optimized @xmath0 is negligible ( solid line and line with open circles almost coincide in fig .",
    "6a ) and the enhancement of the optimized @xmath0 is dominated by the reduction in @xmath218  due to phonon scattering on the inclusions .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that for bulk pbte the seebeck coefficient increases with decrease of the doping concentration @xmath16 , and the _ relative _ enhancement of the seebeck coefficient from its bulk value due to electron scattering on inclusion is smaller at low doping compared to high doping ( see fig 2 ) . as a consequence",
    "the reduction of @xmath3 at low doping overweights the increase of @xmath264 and the power factor is reduced compared to the inclusion - free system , leading to small or vanishing optimal @xmath84 . from a practical point of view",
    "this result means that in order to enhance the @xmath0 factor at low doping levels one needs to find a metal that gives little or no interfacial potential .    for larger doping the electron contribution to enhancement of @xmath0",
    "becomes important and the optimized @xmath84 increases .",
    "it is seen in fig .",
    "6b  that for @xmath260 the ` electron - only ' contribution to enhancement of the optimized @xmath0 makes up over 50% of the enhancement at @xmath265 and",
    "the optimized @xmath84 is as large as @xmath266 .",
    "moreover , at large doping , @xmath267 , and the reduction of @xmath36 due to scattering on inclusions amplifies the effect of the reduced @xmath218 .",
    "the upper inset in fig .",
    "6b shows that the power factor @xmath268 is enhanced only for @xmath269 .",
    "the reduction of the power factor relative to the inclusion - free system at @xmath263 is due to the fact that at high temperature the seebeck coefficient of bulk pbte is already large ( see fig .",
    "4b ) , the _ relative _ increase in @xmath2 induced by electron scattering on inclusions becomes smaller at increased temperature , so the reduction of @xmath3 overweights the increase of @xmath270 . nevertheless ,",
    "the ` electron - only ' contribution results in enhancement of @xmath246 ( open circles in fig .",
    "6b ) even at higher temperatures due to reduction of @xmath36 .",
    "figure 6b shows by open squares the @xmath0 factor for pbte with pb inclusions ( assuming @xmath271 ) for parameters @xmath272 , @xmath235 , and @xmath165 . for this set of parameters",
    "the interface potential @xmath273 is close to the optimal one ( see inset in fig 6b ) in a wide range of temperatures , so the @xmath0 factor for the system with pb inclusions is very close to the optimal @xmath0 .",
    "the enhancement of @xmath0 due to pb inclusions is on the order of 400% at room temperature and 50% at @xmath274 , where it reaches a value as high as @xmath198 .",
    "in conclusion , we developed a theory that allows the calculation of the @xmath0 factor and its components for a system of a semiconductor host material with spherical metallic nanoinclusions .",
    "the enhancement of the seebeck coefficient can be explained by a strong energy dependence of electron scattering on the band - bending at the interface between metallic inclusions and the semiconductor host .",
    "the electronic contribution to enhancement of @xmath241 is important for high doping , while at low doping the enhancement of @xmath241 is dominated by the reduction in the phonon thermal conductivity .",
    "the theory can be used to choose the optimal parameters for the metal nanoinclusions ( interface potential , inclusion volume fraction or radius ) in order to maximize @xmath0 .",
