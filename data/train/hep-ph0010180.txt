    "we show that in this case , even when the matter density is much smaller than the brane tension and the higher order terms are negligible , the cosmology on the observable brane deviates from flrw one and depends on the matter equation of state on the brane .",

    "it is also evident that in this approximation an exactly null cosmological constant is not acceptable because @xmath56 would be zero too . +",
