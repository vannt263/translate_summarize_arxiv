    "the discovery of the iron - pnictides @xcite generated a lot of interest , primarily because high - temperature superconductivity is possible in materials without cuo@xmath2 planes , and also induced a frenetic search for possible common mechanisms between them and the high - temperature superconducting cuprates .",
    "furthermore , the novel class of iron - pnictide based superconductors arose to an interesting playground , in order to study the impact of electronic correlations with respect to the emergence of structural / magnetic and superconducting phase transitions .",
    "the major difference among the phase diagram of the copper - oxide and the iron - pnictide superconductors is that the correlated metallic state in the cuprates derives through chemical doping of parent compounds in the strongly correlated mott insulting state , while the parent compounds of the iron - pnictides are magnetically ordered bad metals .",
    "this means that magnetic - ordering only partially gaps the fermi surface ( fs ) inducing a spin - density - wave ( sdw ) broken - symmetry ground state without initiating an insulating state . upon doping ,",
    "the structural and sdw transitions are suppressed for the benefit of superconductivity @xcite .    a recent optical study on lafepo @xcite gave evidence of electronic correlations in the iron - pnictides , where the kinetic energy of the electrons is reduced to half of that predicted by band theory of nearly free electrons .",
    "this was found to imply that these systems could be on the verge of the mott ( insulator ) transition .",
    "it may then be argued that transport in the iron - pnictides lies between the band - like itinerant and the mott - like local magnetic moment extremes @xcite , and that both coherent and incoherent excitations must be present . optical investigation on several iron - pnictides ( @xmath7fe@xmath2as@xmath2 , @xmath7=ba , sr , ca , eu and ni ) further reveals the presence of two subsystems ; a coherent fermi liquid one out of where superconductivity evolves , and a temperature independent incoherent one , acting as background to the excitation spectrum but still affected by superconductivity @xcite .",
    "many - body effects , as electron - electron or electron - phonon interactions and even magnetic fluctuations , have a tremendous impact on the excitation spectrum , leading to characteristic fingerprints , like the opening of energy ( correlation ) gaps and potentially anomalous redistribution of spectral weight , so well documented in the cuprates @xcite .",
    "optical methods are in principle an ideal spectroscopic tool for addressing these issues .",
    "our strategy consists here in comparing the electrodynamic response of ba(co@xmath0fe@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 for several co - dopings , which belong to the so - called 122 family and are prominent examples of oxygen - free iron - pnictide superconductors .",
    "we systematically span the portion of the phase diagram ranging from the sdw state for the parent compound ( @xmath3=0 ) to the proximity of the antiferromagnetic state to the superconducting phase ( @xmath3=0.025 ) , as well as from the superconducting compounds ( @xmath3=0.051 , 0.061 and 0.11 ) up to the single metallic phase ( @xmath3=0.18 ) .",
    "particular emphasis will be devoted to the impact of the various transitions on the charge dynamics in these co - doped 122 compounds .",
    "our primary goal is to exploit their electrodynamic response in order to shed light on the scattering processes of the itinerant charge carriers as well as to establish with spectral weight argument their degree of electronic correlations .",

    "the crystals have a plate - like morphology , with the @xmath8-axis perpendicular to the plane of the plates , and grow up to several millimeters on a side .",
    "our specimens were from the same batch used for the @xmath5 transport characterization @xcite .",
    "for @xmath9 the coincident structural ( tetragonal - orthorhombic ) and sdw transitions occur at @xmath10=@xmath11=135 k , while for @xmath12 they develop at @xmath10= 98 k and @xmath11= 92 k , respectively .",
    "the compound with @xmath13 undergoes first a structural transition at @xmath10= 50 k and then a sdw one at @xmath11= 37 k. in the latter compound , a superconducting state finally develops below @xmath14= 19 k. at optimal doping @xmath15 as well as for @xmath3=0.11 , there is only the transition into the superconducting state at @xmath14= 23 k and 14 k , respectively .",
    "the @xmath3=0.18 compound does not undergo any phase transitions and is metallic at all temperatures @xcite .",
    "we perform optical reflectivity measurements as a function of temperature from the far - infrared ( fir ) up to the ultraviolet ( uv ) .",
    "this is the prerequisite in order to perform reliable kramers - kronig ( kk ) transformation from where we get the phase of the complex reflectance and then all optical functions , including the real part @xmath16 of the complex optical conductivity . to this end",
    ", we extended the @xmath17 spectra with the hagen - rubens ( hr ) extrapolation for @xmath18 in the metallic phase @xcite and by setting @xmath17 equal to total reflection below a characteristic frequency @xmath19 ( see below ) in the superconducting state .",

    "a sharper plasma edge in @xmath17 develops below about 2000 @xmath23 , leading to larger @xmath17 values than for @xmath240.061 .",
    "this is consistent with the enhanced metallicity with increasing co - doping , as evinced from the @xmath5 transport properties @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence extends over a large energy interval up to about 3000 @xmath23 .",
    "this already anticipates an important reshuffling of spectral weight up to energies much larger than the energy scales defined by the phase transition critical temperatures . for @xmath3=0 in the sdw state",

    "2 ) , inducing a removal of spectral weight .",
    "the depletion as well as the peak at about 800 @xmath23 in @xmath16 are indicative for the opening of a pseudogap , which we identify with the sdw single particle excitation @xcite . for @xmath3=0.025 co - doping ,",
    "the depletion as well as the ( pseudo)gap feature in @xmath16 are less evident and pronounced , even though there is a spectral weight redistribution , leading again to its overshoot above 700 @xmath23 for temperature below @xmath11 .",
    "the signatures for the sdw pseudogap - like excitation as well as the related spectral weight redistribution are no longer well distinct for the @xmath3=0.051 co - doping @xcite . for this latter compound as well as at and above the optimal co - doping ( @xmath280.061 and 0.11 , respectively ) , the total reflection at @xmath29 for @xmath25 leads instead to the opening of the superconducting gap @xcite .",
    "the removed spectral weight is shifted into the collective excitation at zero frequency .",
    "while our data in the superconducting state overall agree with previous work , they do not extend low enough in frequencies , in order to allow an elaborated analysis in terms of multiple superconducting gaps @xcite .",
    "finally , the electrodynamic response of the @xmath3=0.18 compound merely displays a simple metallic behavior .    overall , there are three energy intervals characterizing @xmath16 for all co - dopings ; the effective metallic contribution at low frequencies , the mid - infrared ( mir ) band covering the energy range between 500 and 1500 @xmath23 and the electronic interband transitions with onset at about 2000 @xmath23 and peaked at 5000 @xmath23 . the metallic part as well as",

    "since the superconducting properties were intensively studied by different groups on selected members of the iron - pnictides family @xcite , we will mainly address here the normal and sdw state properties .",
    "to this end , we apply the common and well established phenomenological drude - lorentz approach @xcite . in order to account for the various bands crossing the fermi level @xcite and consistent with previous investigations @xcite , we ascribe two drude contributions ( one narrow and one broad ) to the effective metallic part of @xmath16 and a series of lorentz harmonic oscillators ( h.o . ) for all excitations ( phononic and electronic ) at finite frequencies : @xmath31where @xmath32 is the optical dielectric constant , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the plasma frequencies and the widths of the narrow and broad drude peaks , whereas @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 are the center - peak frequency , the width , and the mode strength for the @xmath38-th lorentz harmonic oscillator ( h.o . ) , respectively .",

    "interestingly enough , @xmath41 and @xmath47 for @xmath3=0 follows a @xmath48 dependence at low temperatures , consistent with previous findings and uncovering a fermi liquid behavior @xcite . for co - dopings",
    "@xmath60.061 , it turns out that @xmath30 scales fairly well with the total resistivity @xmath40 @xcite , as shown in the lower panels of fig .",
    "this derives from the fact that the two drude terms , globally describing the low frequency part of @xmath16 , are no longer so well distinct for @xmath60.061 as for @xmath240.051 and the incoherent contribution largely dominates @xmath16 over the coherent one .",
    "consequently , the decomposition of the metallic contribution in @xmath16 in two independent conduction channels is not unique anymore @xcite .",
    "we thus suggest that for co - dopings , where the fs may be gapped by the sdw instability , @xmath41 shapes the coherent contribution to the @xmath5 transport properties , while for co - dopings above @xmath3=0.061 the scattering rate of the broad ( incoherent ) drude term mainly determines the @xmath5 transport .",

    "this is at variance to the high - temperature superconducting cuprates , where the spectral weight , merging into the collective state at @xmath52=0 as consequence of the opening of the superconducting gap along the @xmath8-axis orthogonal to the cuo@xmath2 plane , is actually transferred from very high energy scales .",

    "figure 5 summarizes indeed the temperature dependence of the spectral weight encountered in the drude terms and in the mir band ( inset of fig .",
    "6 ) . for the parent compound ( @xmath3=0 ) there is an obvious depletion of weight in the drude part at @xmath11 , which is reshuffled into the mir band . at @xmath3=0.025",
    "there is a similar yet more modest redistribution of weight at @xmath11 . at @xmath3=0.051",
    "the drude part of @xmath16 slightly gains weight with decreasing temperature at the cost of the mir part @xcite .",
    "we tend to believe that upon co - doping disorder is induced in the system such that the favorable nesting conditions , so crucial for magnetic order , are progressively suppressed .",
    "disorder may then favor the washing out of the sdw gap feature , as observed for @xmath12 and 0.051 .",
    "we should also add , that for the latter doping @xmath14 is pretty close to @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , by the time the temperature is low enough to allow a fully developed sdw ( pseudo)gap , the system is already in the superconducting state and it is no surprise that almost no signatures of the sdw transition are optically detected for @xmath13 @xcite . for higher",
    "co - dopings ( i.e. , @xmath60.061 ) , the spectral weight of the drude and mir components are almost temperature independent and interestingly enough the drude weight increases with respect to the mir one , the latter observation being an indication for the enhanced metallicity with increasing co - dopings .",
    "we propose a scenario where the conduction band derives from @xmath56-states and splits into two parts : a purely itinerant one close to the fermi level and represented by the two drude components as well as by a bottom part with states below the mobility edge and thus rather localized .",
    "this latter part gives rise to the mir band in @xmath16 , which turns out to be strongly temperature dependent upon magnetic ordering and affected by the opening of the sdw gap .",
    "we can then consider the following ratio : @xmath57where @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the components of the optical conductivity due to the narrow and broad drude terms , and to the mir band within our phenomenological approach ( eq .",
    "( 1 ) and inset of fig .",
    "6 ) , respectively . equation ( 4 ) represents the ratio between the spectral weight encountered in @xmath16 in the drude components ( @xmath61 ) and the total spectral weight collected in @xmath16 up to the onset of the electronic interband transitions ( i.e. , drude components together with the mir absorption feature , @xmath62 ) .",
    "such a ratio is an alternative estimation , exclusively from the experimental findings , of the ratio between the optical kinetic energy extracted from @xmath16 and the band kinetic energy extracted from the band structure within the tight - binding approach @xcite .",
    "our value of @xmath63 for @xmath3=0 is consistent with the previous estimation @xcite , therefore reinforcing the validity of our alternative method .",
    "the inverse of @xmath63 , which then defines the degree of electronic correlations , is plotted in fig . 6 within the phase diagram of the co - doped 122 iron - pnictides @xcite .",
    "@xmath53 thus tracks the evolution of the superconducting dome in the phase diagram of ba(co@xmath0fe@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 .",
    "interestingly enough , electronic correlations seem to be stronger for the parent - compound and for co - dopings @xmath240.061 than for those in the overdoped range .",
    "there is indeed evidence for a crossover from a regime of moderate correlations for @xmath240.061 to a nearly free and non - interacting electron gas system for @xmath60.11 .",
    "we provided a comprehensive optical investigation of ba(co@xmath0fe@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 with several co - dopings , scanning the complete phase diagram . besides establishing a direct relationship between the scattering rates and the @xmath5 transport properties , we shed light on the spectral weight redistribution between the itinerant and the localized portion of the conduction band .",
    "we argue that the 122 iron - pnictides fall in the regime of moderate electronic correlations for the parent compound and close to optimal doping , while a conventional metallic behavior in the nearly free electron limit is recovered at the opposite end of the superconducting dome in their phase diagram .",
