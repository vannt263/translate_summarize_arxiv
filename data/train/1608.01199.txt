    "studies in complex dynamics are invariably as much about variation of dynamics in a parameter space as about the dynamics of individual maps in the parameter space .",
    "this an attractive area of study because of the rich variation , even in parameter spaces of small dimension : complex dimension one is usually ample .",
    "the low dimension is one reason why the study is also relatively tractable .",
    "another reason is the availability of extremely useful tools , of which the yoccoz puzzle is a key example .",
    "the yoccoz puzzle is a sequence of successively finer markov partitions ( obtained by backwards iteration of a single markov partition ) , and the use of markov partitions is of course ubiquitous in dynamics .",
    "there is an associated yoccoz `` parapuzzle '' , a sequence of successively finer partitions of parameter space .",
    "this illustrates the most basic principle in dynamics , that information about parameter space near a map @xmath0 can be obtained from the dynamics of @xmath0 . in complex dynamics , this informations is often remarkably complete .",
    "there have been a number of generalisations of the yoccoz puzzle and parapuzzle , stretching back some 20 years .",
    "see , for example , roesch @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we gave a rather general construction of a markov partition for a geometrically finite rational map for which all fatou components are topological discs and have disjoint closures .",
    "we use the following definition .",
    "* definition * a _ markov partition for @xmath0 _ is a set @xmath1 such that :    * @xmath2 ; * @xmath3 and @xmath4 have disjoint interiors if @xmath5 ; * @xmath6 ; * each @xmath3 is a union of connected components of @xmath7 for varying @xmath8 .",
    "if the sets @xmath3 are closed topological discs such that the intersection of any two is at most a finite union of topological intervals , then @xmath9 is a connected graph with finitely many edges and vertices satisfying @xmath10 .",
    "conversely , given a connected graph @xmath11 with finitely many edges and vertices , and such that all complementary components are topological discs , the set of closures of the complementary components of @xmath11 is a markov partition consisting of closed topological discs with boundaries which intersect in at most finitely many topological intervals .",
    "the construction we gave showed that a graph satisfying certain mild conditions can be approximated arbitrarily closely by an isotopic graph @xmath12 such that @xmath13 for some integer @xmath14 , and that some @xmath15 satisfies all the above properties .    in section 3 of @xcite",
    ", we restricted to a geometrically finite map @xmath0 of degree 2 , for which the closures of the fatou components were disjoint closed topological discs ( as above ) , and a one - dimensional parameter space @xmath16 of rational maps @xmath17 including @xmath0 , with numbered critical points @xmath18 and @xmath19 , with @xmath18 of period @xmath20 under @xmath17 , quotiented by mbius conjugacy preserving numbering of critical points .",
    "we started with a graph @xmath11 with @xmath10 and investigated the associated partitions of parameter space , locally near @xmath0 .",
    "we were allowing @xmath0 , there , to have a parabolic cycle , but could equally well have considered a neighbourhood of the closure of a hyperbolic component , by starting from a hyperbolic map @xmath0 , and making an initial choice of graph disjoint from the closures of periodic fatou components .",
    "we showed in @xcite how to use backward iterates of @xmath11 to obtain successively finer partitions of the parameter space near @xmath0 . in this paper",
    "we want to extend some aspects of this study .",
    "in particular , we want to consider _ type iv _",
    "hyperbolic components in a neighbourhood in @xmath16 of the closure of the hyperbolic component of @xmath0 , and to study the correspondence between these hyperbolic components and the periodic points of @xmath0 . a _ type iv _ hyperbolic component , is a component of hyperbolic quadratic rational maps which which there are two distinct periodic cycles of fatou components  for which , of course , each cycle has to contain one of the two critical points .",
    "the first result of the paper concerning this is [ 2.4 ] .",
    "this theorem is a characterisation of the hyperbolic components in terms of the symbolic dynamics , and complements the results of @xcite , which associated symbolic dynamics to all maps admitting the markov partition .",
    "we also want to consider connections with known topological models of parts of parameter space , and , in particular , with matings .",
    "mating was invented by douady and hubbard in the 1980 s .",
    "it gives a way of constructing some rational maps , up to topological conjugacy , and something more in some cases , from a pair of polynomials of the same degree , with locally connected julia sets .",
    "in particular , a pair of hyperbolic critically finite quadratic polynomials which are not in conjugate limbs of the mandelbrot set can be mated , and the mating is a critically periodic rational map , up to topological conjugacy .",
    "it is known that not all type iv hyperbolic quadratic rational maps are represented up to topological conjugacy by matings , although there are some slices of parameter space , and some parts of slices of parameter space for which it is true .",
    "it is true in @xmath21 , as is pointed out in one of the early results in @xcite .",
    "it is also true in some regions of @xmath22 , as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "one of the aims of the present paper is consider the question locally , in particular , to consider hyperbolic components near the closure of a hyperbolic component , and ask whether all type iv hyperbolic components , which are sufficiently near , are conjugate to matings  or are not all so conjugate .",
    "we shall find examples where all nearby type iv hyperbolic components are indeed represented by matings .",
    "these are new examples , as we shall be considering rational maps for which the closures of fatou components are all disjoint",
    ". our condition will be that the lamination equivalence relation , associated to the mating representing a hyperbolic critically finite rational map  of whose closure of hyperbolic component we are taking a neighbourhood  is particularly simple .",
    "counterexamples , for which it is definitely not true that all nearby hyperbolic components are represented by matings , are harder to prove completely , simply because there are a lot of matings available , and current techniques make it very hard to discount all of them .",
    "but there are plenty of candidates for which all nearby hyperbolic components are unlikely to be represented by matings , and for which the results of section [ 2 ] do give a description of all nearby hyperbolic components in terms of symbolic dynamics .",
    "this has a bearing on the question of continuity of mating .",
    "because of well - known , but unpublished , examples of adam epstein , it is known to be a problem to try to use this model on a space of complex dimension two , even near a geometrically finite map with a parabolic periodic point . but restricted to slices of complex dimension one , there is a chance that the combinatorial model is the right one in some parts of the parameter space .",
    "this is a question that has been considered and answered by ma liangang in his thesis @xcite , under the sort of conditions imposed , and by the sort of techniques used , in this paper .",
    "rather comprehensive continuity results have been proved in the very different case of @xmath21  where the union of closures of fatou components is @xmath23  by dudko @xcite .",
    "[ [ 2.1 ] ]    we write @xmath16 for the set of quadratic rational maps @xmath0 , with numbered critical points @xmath24 and @xmath25 , quotiented by mbius conjugacy preserving numbering of critical points , and with @xmath24 of period @xmath20 .",
    "our rational map @xmath0 will usually be a hyperbolic post - critically - finite quadratic rational map .",
    "a hyperbolic quadratic post - critically - finite rational map is in @xmath16 for some @xmath26 , and is of _ type ii , iii or iv_. here , _",
    ", means that both critical points are in the same periodic orbit , _ type iii _ means that one critical point , say @xmath24 , is periodic and the other , @xmath25 , is strictly periodic , and _ type iv _ means that the two critical points are in distinct periodic orbits .",
    "any hyperbolic component intersecting @xmath16 , for @xmath27 , contains a unique post - critically - finite map , and is accordingly described as being of type ii , iii or iv .",
    "we make the condition that the closures of all fatou components of @xmath0 are disjoint .",
    "equivalently , we can stipulate that the closures of periodic fatou components are disjoint . for @xmath28 ,",
    "this is only possible if @xmath29 .",
    "there are then many choices of piecewise smooth graph @xmath30 , with finitely many edges and vertices , such that :    a.   @xmath31 does not intersect the closure of any periodic fatou component of @xmath0 , and the intersection of @xmath31 with any faou component is connected ; b.   the components of @xmath32 are all open topological discs , and their closures are all closed topological discs ; c.   any component of @xmath32 contains at most one periodic fatou component of @xmath0 ; d.   any edge of @xmath31 has two distinct endpoints , and exactly three edges of @xmath31 , meet at any vertex ; e.   the closures of any two components of @xmath32 intersect in at most one edge of @xmath31 , including endpoints .",
    "theorem 1.2 of @xcite then provides the existence of a graph @xmath12 isotopic and arbitrarily close to @xmath31 such that @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is an integer which is bounded in terms of the degree of closeness required , and also provides the existence of a graph @xmath33 with finitely many vertices and edges , satisfying @xmath34 , with @xmath10 .",
    "then the set @xmath35 of closures of components of @xmath36 is a markov partition .",

    "we also want @xmath777 we then need @xmath778 , in order to obtain the property specified in [ 2.6 ] : @xmath779 in fact we will have @xmath780 for @xmath781 . in order to carry out the inductive step we shall need to take @xmath782 to be a bounded finite union of partition elements of @xmath783 rather than a single set of @xmath783 , for @xmath784 , but for @xmath785 , @xmath786 will be a single set of @xmath787 . we will define @xmath788 .. then as in [ 2.6 ] we define @xmath789 this means that for @xmath790 and @xmath791 , @xmath792 will be a bounded finite of sets of @xmath793 rather than a single set of @xmath794 , . for all @xmath795 , @xmath796 will be a single set of @xmath797    as in [ 2.6 ] , we define @xmath771 , for all @xmath798 , to be the largest integer @xmath799 such that @xmath800 , and then @xmath801 for @xmath781 .",
    "so @xmath802 then we define @xmath803 , for @xmath781 , to be the smallest integer which is not @xmath804 for some @xmath805 and with @xmath806 .",
    "then @xmath807 is the local inverse of @xmath808 which maps @xmath786 to @xmath809 , and @xmath789 we can then prove @xmath810 exactly as in the case @xmath774 , in particular as in [ 3.10 ] ",
    "although for @xmath811 the proof is easier , because we will only have @xmath812 for @xmath774 .",
    "the last step in the proof of the inductive proof for @xmath813 is to obtain @xmath814 and @xmath815  which are then used in the proof for @xmath816 . for @xmath798 ,",
    "that is , @xmath817 , the set @xmath814 is defined in terms of a set @xmath818 .",
    "we define @xmath819 to be the local inverse of @xmath820 which satisfies @xmath821 then we define @xmath822 so we need to define @xmath818 . from the version of ( [ 3.10.1 ] ) for @xmath813 , we need @xmath818 to contain @xmath823 . note that @xmath824 we need every component of @xmath814 to intersect the minor gap of @xmath825 , which means that we need this to be true for @xmath818 also .",
    "so @xmath818 is defined by adding to @xmath826 shorter complementary components so that @xmath818 has at most two components .    in order to bound @xmath818  and",
    "hence also bound @xmath814  we need @xmath827 to be a homeomorphism on @xmath818 for @xmath828 if @xmath785 and for @xmath829 for @xmath790 .",

    "it is tempting to enlarge @xmath858 to a set which is still disjoint from @xmath859 and hence to obtain the other results , but with this choice it is not quite clear that @xmath858 is bounded from @xmath859 , so we proceed a little differently .",
    "we have    @xmath860 where @xmath399 is a local inverse of @xmath861 for some @xmath862 , with domain including @xmath863 , and @xmath864 so if @xmath865 then we deduce that @xmath866 is bounded from @xmath867 for any of the choices of @xmath857 , with @xmath868 or @xmath869 , as appropriate , simply because we can assume by choice of partition that the set @xmath857 is arbitrarily close to @xmath870 .",
    "now for the last statement of the lemma , we see that , since @xmath871\\setminus s_{m , h}p^{j_1m}(h)$ ] , both @xmath872 and the set @xmath873 , which is in a small neighbourhood of the former set , are mapped forward by @xmath874 into @xmath875 and therefore we have @xmath876 it follows that @xmath877 for @xmath878 , as previously defined .",
    "we will see below that @xmath879 , and that @xmath880 for @xmath843 .",
