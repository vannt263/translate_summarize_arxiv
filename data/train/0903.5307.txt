    "in systems that contain interacting degrees of freedom , resonances commonly develop which can not be described by a perturbative approach .",
    "this is generally known as the sommerfeld effect @xcite , and has been widely studied in the fields of chemistry , nuclear and condensed matter physics , and also in the dynamics of mechanical and electrical systems . in particle physics , effective theories",
    "are constructed to deal with bound states , but the main tool for evaluating physical quantities such as cross sections and decay rates is perturbation theory .",
    "it is then common to neglect non - perturbative contributions .",
    "this is usually a reasonable approximation for relativistic particles , but for slow moving particles the influence of non - perturbative scattering interactions before and/or after the main interaction event becomes very significant .",
    "recently , the importance of the sommerfeld effect in dark matter annihilation has been pointed out in @xcite for properly calculating thermal relic densities , and determining signals for indirect dark matter searches .",
    "other examples where the sommerfeld effect is crucial include threshold production of heavy states at colliders , and partial decay rates when the products have large phase space suppression .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to review the origin of the sommerfeld effect from a particle physics perspective , and demonstrate its significance for some common interactions .",
    "this work was initially motivated in order to determine the sommerfeld factor for arbitrary partial wave ( @xmath0 ) processes , which had been overlooked .",
    "it is found that , even in cases where higher partial waves can safely be neglected at the perturbative level , these channels can become dominant when the non - perturbative physics is properly accounted for . for an application of the numerical p - wave results in this paper to relic density calculations ,",
    "see  @xcite . during preparation of this paper . ] , a similar derivation of the general sommerfeld factor has been provided in  @xcite .",
    "apart from for pure electromagnetic interactions , it is necessary to use numerical simulations in order to evaluate the sommerfeld factor .",
    "the computational requirements can then be an obstacle to including the sommerfeld effect in relevant calculations . in this paper , an approximate analytic expression",
    "is also found for the sommerfeld factor of yukawa interactions for arbitrary partial waves , which is exact in the coulomb limit .",
    "so far as the author is aware this is a new result , and is found to be accurate to within 10% for the most common applications .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ deriv ] outlines the derivation of the sommerfeld factor for arbitrary partial wave processes .",
    "section  [ app ] then determines the approximate analytic expression for the sommerfeld factor in the presence of yukawa interactions . in section  [ results ] , the numerical and analytic results are evaluated and compared .",
    "section  [ conc ] presents the conclusions .",
    "the non - perturbative physics that leads to the sommerfeld effect can be thought of as the limit of perturbative feynman diagrams with an infinite number of particle exchanges .",
    "for a two body incoming or outgoing state , it is useful to consider the non - perturbative 4-point vertex function , @xmath1 , in order to quantify the sommerfeld effect . in this section , the method for determining @xmath1",
    "is first presented .",
    "this function is then used to relate the non - perturbative cross section of an arbitrary process to the perturbatively calculated prediction .",
    "the ratio of these results defines the  sommerfeld factor . \"",
    "the non - perturbative 4-point vertex function is a solution of the bethe - salpeter equation :        @xmath2 where @xmath3 are  compact \" vertices which do not involve any intermediate state composed solely of the scattering particles ( ie are described by two - particle irreducible diagrams ) , and @xmath4 is the non - perturbative propagator .",
    "the inhomogeneous integral equation for @xmath1 can be solved to arbitrary accuracy by a liouville - neumann series or fourier methods , given that @xmath3 and the propagator are sufficiently well known from perturbative calculations . however , in the non - relativistic limit , such methods are difficult or sometimes impossible to implement .",
    "this case is most relevant for some common particle physics situations where the sommerfeld effect is of great significance , and so is now concentrated on .",
    "fig  [ bs ] can equivalently be expressed as the sum of feynman diagrams with an increasing number of @xmath3 insertions . in the non - relativistic limit , @xmath3 usually is dominated by single particle exchange . for this reason ,",
    "this class of diagram is often referred to as a  ladder \" , ( which can be better visualised when the scattering particle propagators in fig  [ bs ] are drawn as straight lines ) .",
    "the approximation appropriate for the non - relativistic limit is that of instantaneous interactions @xcite .",
    "this requires that the dependence of the momenta time components in the matrix element is removed . for the intermediate scattering particles that connect subsequent @xmath3 insertions",
    ", this prescription puts those propagators on - shell .",
    "the diagrams with finite ladders are then negligible compared to the infinite ladder diagram .",
    "the non - perturbative character of the vertex function @xmath1 is now manifest . in the non - relativistic limit",
    ", the bethe - salpeter equation becomes a homogeneous integral equation . to transform this equation into a more familiar form , it is convenient to introduce the function @xmath5 with the following definition : @xmath6 from now on , the ( @xmath7 ) arguments will implicitly be assumed in @xmath5 .",
    "they do not influence the following steps for solving the bethe - salpeter equation , which is now expressed as : @xmath8 the leading contribution to @xmath3 in the non - relativistic limit is usually from single particle exchange . as an example , consider a scalar yukawa theory with the interaction @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a dimensionless coupling constant . in the case of two @xmath11 particles scattering ,",
    "the leading contribution to @xmath3 is : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and the scattering interaction involves single @xmath14 exchange . as mentioned before ,",
    "the instantaneous approximation is required for the non - relativistic limit which sets @xmath15 in @xmath3 .",
    "the perturbative vertex function then only depends on the transferred 3-momentum , @xmath16 .",
    "this is a general feature in the non - relativistic limit , but it should be noted that the @xmath5 function still retains @xmath17 dependence . the following parameters and function",
    "are now introduced : @xmath18 in the centre of mass frame , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the total kinetic energy of the system . the bethe - salpeter equation with the instantaneous approximation applied",
    "is then given by : @xmath22 it is now useful to also introduce the bethe - salpeter wavefunction : @xmath23 using this and integrating eq  ( [ bsinst ] ) over the @xmath24 variable , the following equation is obtained for the scalar yukawa case after re - arranging a multiplicative factor : @xmath25 where @xmath21 is the total kinetic energy of the system , @xmath26 , and only the leading term in @xmath27 is kept .",
    "the bethe - salpeter wavefunction therefore is a solution of the schrdinger equation ( here in integral form ) , with a potential that accounts for the interactions included in @xmath3 . for external states",
    "that have non - zero spin , the same steps can be applied and the schrdinger equation is similarly found in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "for further discussion of the bethe - salpeter equation , see @xcite .",
    "the result of including the infinite series of scattering interactions has effectively transformed the incoming states from plane waves to a composite state described by @xmath28 .",
    "the corrections to @xmath3 generally include annihilation channels .",
    "this introduces an imaginary term into the schdinger equation which results in a finite lifetime for the composite state . in scattering processes , bound states",
    "can not be formed without radiating off energy .",
    "the composite state found then generally can not easily be described by an effective theory , and its influence is usually neglected .",
    "for an example of including the non - perturbative scattering prior to the main interaction event , consider two body annihilation as shown in fig  [ annpic ] :        the non - perturbative matrix element , @xmath29 , is related to the perturbative result , @xmath30 , according to : @xmath31 where it is assumed that the sommerfeld effect in the final states is negligible .",
    "this neglected feature can easily be included by the same technique , but for simplicity it is ignored here .",
    "the non - perturbative matrix element can be evaluated once the solution of @xmath1 in eq  ( [ bse ] ) is found . in the non - relativistic limit , the instantaneous approximation should be applied to the perturbative matrix element , @xmath30 .",
    "on performing the @xmath32 integration for this case , it is seen that the bethe - salpeter wavefunction then weights the perturbative result as follows : @xmath33 where the centre of mass frame has been chosen . in a partial wave expansion ,",
    "the leading terms in the non - relativistic limit for @xmath30 , with a given angular momentum @xmath34 , behave proportional to @xmath35 in the centre of mass frame , where @xmath36 here is the magnitude of the 3-momentum of either particle , and @xmath37 is a spherical harmonic function .    for the s - wave case , it can immediately be seen by evaluating the integral that the non - perturbative matrix element differs by a factor of @xmath38 relative to the perturbatively calculated result , where @xmath39 is the position space representation of the bethe - salpeter wavefunction . the sommerfeld factor for a given partial wave , @xmath34 ,",
    "is defined as : @xmath40 in the non - relativistic limit , @xmath41 is simply @xmath42 . in order to evaluate eq  ( [ mladd2 ] ) for higher partial waves , it is convenient to decompose the wavefunction in the ( orthogonal ) spherical harmonic basis .",
    "the wavefunction components can then also be written in a separable form as defined below : @xmath43 for a particular partial wave process , using @xmath44 in eq  ( [ mladd2 ] ) with @xmath45 being some momentum independent factor , the non - perturbative matrix element is equivalently given by : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the solid angle aligned with respect to the original collision axis of the incoming states .",
    "for a given partial wave , the bethe - salpeter wavefunction generated by scattering interactions is forced to have the same quantum numbers . in the perturbative case ,",
    "the momentum appearing in the matrix element is fixed by the incoming states , @xmath48 .",
    "the sommerfeld factor can then be determined from eq  ( [ msph ] ) using eq  ( [ sdef ] ) to obtain : @xmath49 in order to evaluate the result of integrating the momentum wavefunction weighted by different powers of @xmath36 , it is useful to consider the radial fourier transformation .",
    "this is now determined from the usual fourier transformation : @xmath50   y_{l m}^ { } ( \\omega_r^ { } )   \\nonumber \\\\[9pt ] & \\equiv &    r_{el}^ { } ( r ) ~y_{l m}^ { } ( \\omega_r^ { } ) \\label{four}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the result of differentiation of the radial wavefunction leads to the relation : @xmath51 f_{e l}^ { } ( k ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a series expansion of the bessel function then gives , @xmath52 where @xmath53 , and so the following result is found : @xmath54 using this in eq  ( [ slone ] ) , the sommerfeld factor for the partial wave cross section with angular momentum @xmath34 is equivalently given by : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the magnitude of the 3-momentum of either incoming particle in the centre of mass frame at infinite separation .",
    "this result has been derived in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "so far as the author is aware , this is a new result that , during preparation of this paper , has also been independently presented by iengo @xcite ( and see footnote 1 ) .",
    "in the previous section , it was shown that the sommerfeld factor is related to solutions of the schdinger equation in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "the relevant potential is constructed by considering the interactions present in two - particle irreducible diagrams . for some common examples such as gauge boson , meson or higgs interactions ,",
    "a yukawa potential is found at leading order . for a non - zero mass of the mediator responsible for the yukawa interaction ,",
    "there is no analytic solution for the wavefunction .",
    "this can then be determined numerically , however for many applications , an approximate analytic solution may be adequate for the level of precision desired . in this section , an approximate analytic wavefunction is found for the yukawa potential and the sommerfeld factor is then determined .",
    "the results are exact in the coulomb limit , relevant for electromagnetic interactions .    given a spherically symmetric potential , @xmath57 , the schrdinger equation is separable .",
    "for a two - body system containing particles with a common mass @xmath58 , the radial part of the wavefunction obeys the following : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the speed of each particle when at infinite separation in the centre of mass frame .",
    "natural units ( @xmath61 ) are now used for the rest of this discussion . for yukawa interactions ,",
    "the potential is of the form : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the mass of the mediator for the interaction , and @xmath64 is the interaction strength which is positive ( negative ) for an attractive ( repulsive ) interaction .",
    "in order to find an approximate analytic solution , the following approximation is applied to the potential : @xmath65 this approximation maintains the same short and long distance behaviour of the yukawa potential , and is commonly known as the hulthn potential .",
    "the question is then raised as to what choice of @xmath66 best reproduces the yukawa potential . in order to answer this question for small strengths of the potential , parametrised by @xmath64 , it is useful to consider the schrdinger equation in an equivalent form known as the lippmann - schwinger equation : @xmath67\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the sommerfeld factor is sensitive to the behaviour of the wavefunction at the position space origin . in order for the approximation to be precise up to @xmath71 in the limit of zero kinetic energy ,",
    "it is necessary for the first moment of the radial potential , @xmath72 , to be unchanged by the substitution @xmath73 .",
    "this fixes the relation : @xmath74 for @xmath75 , there is no analytic relation between @xmath66 and @xmath63 which equates the first order correction to the wavefunction , but limited progress can be made by performing a series expansion in @xmath76 . in the following analysis",
    ", the identification in eq  ( [ del ] ) is assumed for all strengths of the potential and kinetic energies .",
    "however , it should be stressed that more accurate results can be obtained if the choice of @xmath66 is improved for these cases .",
    "the s - wave wavefunctions can now be found analytically , but for @xmath0 , a further approximation @xcite must be applied to the centrifugal term in order to permit analytic solutions : @xmath77 this is reasonable for short range potentials , but does not reproduce the correct long distance behaviour .",
    "these approximations convert the effective potential of the radial schrdinger equation into a form that allows solutions in terms of hypergeometric functions , and therefore is a special case of the natanzon hypergeometric potential @xcite . for the chosen approximations",
    ", @xmath78 is in the form also known as a manning - rosen or eckart potential .",
    "the physics of the schrdinger equation is only sensitive to certain combinations of the free parameters .",

    "the sommerfeld factor in this dimensionless formalism is given by : @xmath97 however , a naive application of the @xmath98 approximate yukawa wavefunction in this formula can give results that violate the unitarity limit .",
    "this is a consequence of the approximation applied to the effective centrifugal potential .",
    "a more careful analysis is provided in the next section that properly accounts for the centrifugal approximation .",
    "after modification of the centrifugal term , the free particle eigenstates are no longer plane wave solutions .",
    "an equivalent statement is that the canonical momentum of the position co - ordinate is modified by the approximation .",
    "the transformation between the position representation and canonical momentum representation is determined from the usual completeness relation : @xmath99 since the spherical harmonics are unaffected by the approximation , the same steps as in eq  ( [ four ] ) can be applied to obtain the modified radial transformation relation : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the free particle solution , which can be determined from eq  ( [ rsol ] ) by taking the limit @xmath102 : @xmath103 it follows from the above that the density of states remains unchanged , as assumed in eq  ( [ complete ] ) . in the limit @xmath90 ,",
    "the correct centrifugal term is recovered and so it is expected that the standard radial fourier transform , as given in eq  ( [ four ] ) , is also recovered .",
    "this result can be verified by noting the following identity : @xmath104 and considering the limiting behaviour of the @xmath1 function and @xmath83 function , given in eq  ( [ glim ] ) and eq  ( [ flim ] ) . the standard transformation is indeed found in the limit @xmath90 .",
    "the same derivation of the sommerfeld factor as presented in section  [ deriv ] can be carried out up until eq  ( [ slone ] ) , where the sommerfeld factor is given as an integral of the momentum space wavefunction weighted by various powers of momentum . at this point , to evaluate the integral , it is necessary to consider derivatives of eq  ( [ rdmodi ] ) instead of the standard radial transformation .",
    "using the series expansion in eq  ( [ rser ] ) for the free particle solution , the sommerfeld factor for a two body system with the modified centrifugal potential , @xmath105 , is then : @xmath106 note for @xmath107 and/or @xmath90 , this reduces to the usual sommerfeld factor as expected when the centrifugal term and/or its substituted approximation vanishes .",
    "this can be seen using the relation @xmath108 for the @xmath107 case , and eq  ( [ glim ] ) for the @xmath90 limit .",
    "the approximate analytic sommerfeld factor is now presented for the case of yukawa interactions for arbitrary partial waves .",
    "substituting the approximate wavefunction , given in eq  ( [ rsol ] ) , into the sommerfeld factor which accounts for the modified centrifugal term , the following result is found : @xmath109 in the coulomb limit , this becomes : @xmath110 using the relation @xmath111 recursively , and that @xmath112 for real  @xmath113 , the coulomb case can equivalently be written as : @xmath114 recall that this result is exact for the coulomb limit . although the perturbative cross sections of higher partial waves are suppressed by factors of @xmath115 in the non - relavistic limit , this result indicates that in the zero velocity limit ( @xmath116 ) , the sommerfeld effect introduces a multiplicative factor that leads to all partial wave cross sections having the same velocity dependence .    in the large screening limit for the yukawa potential ( @xmath117 ) ,",
    "the sommerfeld effect saturates when the de broglie wavelengths of the scattering particles are much greater than the range of the potential .",
    "however , in the attractive case , resonances can develop when the system is close to bound states leading to large enhancements , and these states can form at zero energy . for finite range potentials such as the yukawa case , the number of bound states present is always finite . below a critical value for the coupling ,",
    "no bound states can form and so the magnitude of the sommerfeld factor is bounded . in the limit @xmath118 , the sommerfeld factor is approximately : @xmath119 where @xmath120 .",
