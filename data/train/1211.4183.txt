    "as a background independent approach to quantize general relativity ( gr ) , loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) has been widely investigated in the past 25 years@xcite . recently , this non - perturbatively loop quantization procedure has been successfully generalized to the metric @xmath1 theories@xcite , brsns - dicke theory @xcite and scalar - tensor theories@xcite .",
    "in fact , the scheme of these loop quantum modified gravity theories can be extended to more general metric theories of gravity with well - defined geometrical dynamics @xcite .",
    "however , to go round the extreme complexity of a full theory of quantum gravity , one approach usually taken is to apply the formal quantization prescriptions to symmetry - reduced models .",
    "these relatively simple toy models could be employed to test the ideas and constructions of the full theory and to draw some physical predictions .",
    "the so - called loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) is such a symmetry - reduced model from lqg .",
    "we refer to @xcite for reviews on lqc . similarly , to further test the constructions and explore the physical contents of loop quantum scalar - tensor theories , it is desirable to study their symmetry - reduced models , such as cosmological models . among all scalar - tensor theories of gravity ,",
    "the most simple one is the so - called brans - dicke theory which was introduced brans and dicke in 1961 to modify gr in accordance with mach s principle @xcite .",
    "the cosmological models of classical brans - dicke theory were first studied in @xcite . then many aspects of brans - dicke cosmology have been widely investigated in the past decades@xcite . the scalar field non - minimally coupled with curvature in brans - dicke theory is even expected to account for the dark energy problem @xcite , which has become a topical issue in cosmology @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the solar system experiments constrain the coupling constant @xmath2 of the original 4-dimensional brans - dicke theory to be a very large number @xcite . for simplicity consideration and consistency with the solar system experiments",
    ", we will only consider the original brans - dicke theory with coupling constant @xmath0 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the canonical structure and connection dynamics in the spatially flat frw model of classical brans - dicke theory is first given in section [ sec:2 ] .",
    "then we construct the loop quantum brans - dicke cosmology in section [ section3 ] , where the dynamical difference equation representing cosmological evolution in the quantum theory is derived . in section [ section4 ] , by simplifying our quantum hamiltonian constraint , the path integral method is employed to obtain an effective hamiltonian constraint . in the light of this effective hamiltonian , the effective dynamical equations of loop quantum brans - dicke cosmology is derived in section [ section6 ] , which implies a quantum bounce near to the classical big bang singularity .",
    "conclusions and outlooks are given in the last section .",
    "the original gravitational action of 4-dimensional brans - dicke theory reads @xcite s(g)=_d^4x[-(_)^][action ] where @xmath3 is a scalar field , @xmath4 denotes the scalar curvature of spacetime metric @xmath5 , and @xmath2 is the coupling constant .",
    "now we consider the spatially flat , homogeneous and isotropic model .",
    "according to the cosmological principle , one can write the line element of the spacetime metric of our universe as the following standard form , which is the so - called friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric ds^2=-dt^2+a^2(t)(dr^2+r^2(d^2+^2d^2 ) ) where @xmath6 is the scale factor . at classical level",
    ", if one assumes that the matter constituent of the universe be some perfect fluid , the evolution equations of brans - dicke cosmology would read @xcite ( + ) ^2&=&()^2+,[fried ] + + 2()^2+&=&(-p+(+1)),and the equation of motion for the scalar field is -(a^3)&=&(-+3p),where a dot over a letter denotes the derivative with respect to the cosmological time @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are respectively the energy density and pressure of the fluid . in the case that the matter part is a massless scalar field , because @xmath10 , the above equation will reduce to -(a^3)&=&. [ seom ]    recall that loop quantum scalar - tensor theories are based on their connection dynamical formalism @xcite , where the phase space consists of canonical pairs of geometrical conjugate variables , @xmath11 connection @xmath12 and densitized triad @xmath13 , and scalar conjugate variables @xmath14 .",
    "the poisson brackets between the canonical variables read \\{a^j_a(x),e_k^b(y)}&=&^b_a^j_k(x , y ) , + \\{(x),(y)}&=&(x , y ) , where @xmath15 . to mimic the full theory",
    ", we can do the following symmetric reduction of the connection formalism as in standard lqc .",
    "we first introduce an  elemental cell \" @xmath16 on the homogeneous spatial manifold @xmath17 and restrict all integrals to this elemental cell .",
    "then we choose a fiducial euclidean metric @xmath18 on @xmath17 as well as the orthonormal triad and co - triad @xmath19 , such that @xmath20 . for simplicity",
    ", we let the elemental cell @xmath16 be cubic as measured by @xmath18 and denote its volume by @xmath21 .",
    "for spatially flat frw model we have @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a nonzero real number and @xmath24 is defined in @xcite .",
    "via fixing the degrees of freedom of local gauge and diffeomorphism transformations , we finally yield the reduced connection and densitized triad as @xcite a_a^i = v_0 ^ -13  ^o^i_a , e^b_j = pv_0 ^ -23  ^oe^b_j , where @xmath25 are only functions of @xmath7 .",
    "hence the phase space of cosmological model consists of conjugate pairs @xmath26 and @xmath14 .",

    "[ poissonb]note that the new variables are related to the old ones by @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the gaussian and diffeomorphism constraints in the full theory have been solved by the symmetric reduction .",
    "hence , in the cosmological model we only need to treat the remaining hamiltonian constraint .",
    "its expression in the full theory reads @xcite h&= & + & + & ( + 2 + ) + & + & ( d_a ) d^a+d_ad^a + & = & 0.[bdhamilton ] in the cosmological model which we are considering , the above hamiltonian constraint reduces to h&=&-+(+)^2=0.[chamilton ]    recall that in the cosmological model of gr minimally coupled with a massless scalar field , the scalar field can be viewed as an emergent internal time variable .",
    "an interesting question arising in our brans - dicke cosmology is that whether the scalar field nonminimally coupled with the geometry can still be viewed as emergent time . to answer this question , we check the evolution equation of the scalar field , = \\{,h}=(+ ) . if we could show that @xmath29 is a constant of motion , the scalar field would be a monotonic function with respect to the cosmological time .",
    "this is indeed the case since = \\{p_,h } & = & -(-+ + ) + & = & -h0 , where @xmath30 is the sign function for @xmath31 .",
    "therefore we conclude that , although the scalar field is nonminimally coupled with geometry in brans - dicke cosmology , it can still be viewed as an emergent time variable .",
    "to quantize the cosmological model , we first need to construct the quantum kinematics of brans - dicke cosmology by mimicking the loop quantum scalar - tensor theory .",
    "this is the so - called polymer - like quantization .",
    "the kinematical hilbert space for the geometry part can be defined as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are respectively the bohr compactification of the real line and haar measure on it @xcite . on the other hand , for convenience",
    "we choose schrodinger representation for the scalar field @xcite .",
    "thus the kinematical hilbert space for the scalar field part is defined as in usual quantum mechanics , @xmath35 .",
    "hence the whole hilbert space of brans - dicke cosmology is a direct product , @xmath36 .",
    "now let @xmath37 be the eigenstates of @xmath38 in the kinematical hilbert space @xmath39 such that = .",
    "then those eigenstates satisfy orthonormal condition _",

    "for the convenience of studying quantum dynamics , we define new variables v:=2sgn(p)|^-3,b:=| , where @xmath41 with @xmath42 being a minimum nonzero eigenvalue of the area operator @xcite .",
    "they also form a pair of conjugate variables as \\{b , v}=  .it turns out that the eigenstates of @xmath43 also contribute an orthonormal basis in @xmath39 .",
    "we denote @xmath44 as the generalized orthonormal basis for the whole hilbert space @xmath45 . in @xmath46 representation , the hamiltonian constraint ( [ chamilton ] ) can be written as h=-+(+)^2=0 .",
    "now we come to the quantum dynamics . as in usual lqc , we start with the hamiltonian constraint of full theory .",
    "however , since what we consider here is the homogeneous universe , the last two terms containing spatial derivative in the hamiltonian ( [ bdhamilton ] ) can be neglected .",
    "hence we write eq.([bdhamilton ] ) as @xmath47 .",
    "the quantization of the first two terms in @xmath48 is similar to that in usual lqc @xcite .",
    "thus the sum of the first two terms act on a quantum state @xmath49 as ( _ 1+_2)(,)=1(b ) a(v)(b)(,)where a(v)(,)=|v|||v+1|-|v-1||(,).hence the final result is ( _ 1+_2)(,)=1(f_+(v)(+4,)+f_0(v)(,)+f_-(v)(-4,)),where f_+(v)=||v+3|-|v+1|||v+2| , + f_-(v)=f_+(v-4 ) , f_0(v)=-f_+(v)-f_-(v).now we turn to @xmath50 terms .",
    "note that here we need to quantize the term @xmath51 .",
    "due to the spatial flatness , we have @xmath52 . in the cosmological model",
    ", this term can be reduced by a_a^ie^a_ip=.because we use polymer representation for geometry , there is no quantum operator corresponding to connection @xmath53 as in standard lqc @xcite .",
    "hence we have to replace the connection by holonomy to get a well - defined operator .",
    "this can be achieved by using the classical identity _ |0 = _",
    "|0_i=_i  , where @xmath54 , @xmath55 is pauli matrices and the holonomy is defined by h^(|)_i:=__1__+2_i  .",
    "@xmath56 is the @xmath57 unit matrix .",
    "thus , according to eq.([holonomy ] ) we can replace connection @xmath53 by holonomy @xmath58 . then the symmetry - reduced expression of the sum of @xmath50 terms becomes ( + ) ^2(()^2 + 2sgn(p)()(b)+ ) .",
    "let @xmath59 .",
    "based on the above discussion , the action of @xmath60 on a quantum state read _",
    "3(,v)&=&()^2 ( b)(b)(,v ) + & = & -()^2.similarly , for @xmath61 term we have _",

    "5(,v)&= & ( , v ) + & = & -()^2b(v)(),where b(v)=(32)^3|v|||v+1|^1/3-|v-1|^1/3|^3 .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian constraint ( [ bdhamilton ] ) has been successfully quantized in the cosmological model .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint equation of loop quantum brans - dicke cosmology reads ( ^5_i=1_i)(,v)=0.[hbd ] with this quantum dynamical equation in hand , in principle one can study the evolutional behavior of the universe around the classical big bang singularity by numerical simulation .",
    "however , since the terms related to the brans - dicke scalar field are involved in the quantum hamiltonian , the numerical simulation becomes very complicated , which we would like to leave for future study . in this paper , we will employ an effective hamiltonian instead of the full quantum hamiltonian to study the dynamical evolution of the universe in this model .",
    "to study the effective theory of loop quantum brans - dicke cosmology , we also want to know the effect of matter fields on the dynamical evolution .",
    "hence we now include an extra massless scalar matter field @xmath63 into brans - dicke cosmology .",
    "then classically the total hamiltonian constraint of the model reads h & = & -+(+)^2+=0[hcm]where @xmath64 is the momentum conjugate to @xmath63 . in the quantum theory ,",
    "the whole hilbert space now is a direct product of three parts , @xmath65 . here",
    "the kinematical hilbert space for the matter part is also defined as in usual quantum mechanics as @xmath66 . the action of the hamiltonian of matter field on a quantum state @xmath67 reads ( v,,)=-^2b(v ) .[hm ]",
    "to test the robustness of key features of loop quantum cosmology , a simplified soluble model of lqc was proposed in ref.@xcite . in the simplified model ,",
    "one first adapted the classical theory to the scalar matter field time by the following `` harmonic gauge '' form of spacetime metric : ds^2=-a^6()d^2+a^2()(dr^2+r^2(d^2+^2d^2 ) ) .",
    "then the hamiltonian constraint ( [ hcm ] ) becomes h_s & = & -+(+)^2+p_^2=0.[shcm]in the corresponding quantum theory , we denote quantum state @xmath68 for short .",
    "then the simplified hamiltonian constraint equation reads = -(v),[hs]where ( v)&=&v + & -&()^2 v + & + & ( ) v+(v ) + & & ( ^4_i=1_i)(v).[hamilton]thus we get a klein - gordon type equation for the quantum dynamics of brans - dicke cosmology coupled with a massless scalar field . note that the constraint equation ( [ hs ] ) could also be reduced from the hamiltonian ( [ hbd ] ) and ( [ hm ] ) by the replacements @xcite : b(v),and a(v)=|v| . the first replacement amounts to assuming @xmath69 , which then implies the validity of the second replacement .",
    "the effective description of lqc is a delicate and topical issue since it may relate the quantum gravity effects to low - energy physics .",
    "the effective hamiltonian of lqc are being studied from both canonical perspective@xcite and path integral perspective@xcite . with the help of the hamiltonian constraint equation ( [ hs ] )",
