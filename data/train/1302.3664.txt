    "application of magnetic fields to geometrically frustrated magnets induces a variety of novel magnetic phases , such as the magnetization plateau phase  @xcite and the supersolid phase  @xcite .",
    "these phases emerge as a result of the interplay between the magnetic field and the competing magnetic interactions .",
    "this has prompted intensive research aimed at exploring novel magnetic phases that are peculiar to geometrically frustrated magnets in recent decades .",
    "as for the vicinity of a fully polarized phase , theoretical works predict the appearance of novel magnetic phases such as the bose - einstein condensation of two - magnon bound states ( a spin nematic phase )  @xcite and a crystallization of magnons  @xcite based on a magnon picture in which the fully polarized state is regarded as a vacuum state . yet , relatively few experimental studies have been conducted so far because extreme physical conditions such as ultrahigh magnetic fields are of necessity for experimental investigation of magnetic phases in the geometrically frustrated magnets up to full magnetization moment because of their extremely strong antiferromagnetic coupling .",
    "therefore , the development of techniques that allow measurements to be performed in ultra - high magnetic fields has played a crucial role in elucidation of physics that originate from the geometrical frustration .    until recently",
    ", the faraday rotation measurement , from which a magnetization curve is reproduced under certain conditions  @xcite , has been almost the only method available to investigate magnetic properties under ultra - high magnetic fields ( above 100 t )  @xcite . however , it was difficult to identify all magnetic phases only from the magnetization curves .",
    "for example , in the case of zncr@xmath0s@xmath1 , which is considered a bond - frustrated magnet  @xcite , ultrasound measurements showed a discernible anomaly .",
    "while this anomaly indicated the existence of phase transition that was accompanied by the change of crystal structure , the magnetization curve monotonically increased up to a saturation moment , without any noticeable anomalies  @xcite .",
    "this example demonstrates that the magnetization curve is not always sufficient to reflect the magnetic phases .",
    "magnetization measurement systems have been substantially improved recently by utilizing the electro - magnetic induction method adjusted for use in a single - turn coil method capable of measuring up to magnetic fields of above 100 t  @xcite .",
    "consequently , the sensitivity of magnetization changes became much higher than that obtained using the faraday rotation measurement method in this range of high magnetic fields .",
    "furthermore , absorption spectral measurements on the @xmath2-@xmath2 transition and exciton - magnon - phonon ( emp ) transition were shown to be a powerful tool that allow the detection of any changes in crystal as well as magnetic structures in magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "this method was shown to be as useful as the ultrasound and magnetostriction measurements  @xcite . moreover",
    ", the absorption spectral measurements can derive information related to magnetic structures from the emp transitions , in addition to that of crystal fields .    in chromium spinel oxides , @xmath3cr@xmath4o@xmath5 ( @xmath6 zn , cd , hg )",
    ", cr@xmath7 ions form a pyrochlore lattice . therefore ,",
    "these compounds have been recognized as typical three - dimensional geometrically frustrated magnets  @xcite .",
    "the magnetic properties of chromium spinel oxides strongly depend on the spin - lattice interactions  @xcite .",
    "complicated magnetic structures associated with lattice distortions appear at the nel temperature of chromium spinel oxides ; this phenomenon was termed `` order by distortion ''  @xcite . when subjected to a strong magnetic field",
    ", these compounds exhibit rich magnetic phases such as the robust half - magnetization plateau phase  @xcite .",
    "these phases were well captured by a bilinear - biquadratic model that considers spin - lattice interactions , as was first theoretically described by penc _",
    "et al . _",
    "in addition , we were the first to report a canted 2:1:1 phase that preceded the half - magnetization plateau phase in zncr@xmath4o@xmath5  @xcite , which was already predicted theoretically for a small limit of the biquadratic term in the model  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , magneto - optical absorption spectral measurements , described above , have revealed a novel magnetic phase prior to a fully polarized phase in zncr@xmath4o@xmath5  @xcite .",
    "this observation was beyond the framework of the existing theory that is based on the bilinear - biquadratic model  @xcite .",
    "this novel phase was known to be very important in a boson picture , as it corresponds to a superfluid state sandwiched between the supersolid and the liquid states , in good analogy with the theory that was developed for @xmath8he quantum phases  @xcite .",
    "this prompted the question of whether the novel phase that precedes the saturation moment is observable only in zncr@xmath4o@xmath5 or whether it exists in other chromium spinel oxides that have different strengths of spin - lattice interactions .",
    "magnetization curves up to a full saturation moment have already been obtained for cdcr@xmath4o@xmath5 using the faraday rotation measurement method in magnetic fields of up to 140 t generated by the single - turn coil technique , but with a limited resolution  @xcite . here , we focus on high - magnetic - field phases of cdcr@xmath4o@xmath5 ( nel temperature @xmath9 k and curie - weiss temperature @xmath10 k  @xcite ) , investigated in more detail using both magnetization and magneto - optical absorption spectral measurements that are conducted in ultra - high magnetic fields .",
    "we conducted the magnetization measurements using the induction method under ultrahigh magnetic fields ( above 100 t ) using a vertical single - turn coil ( vstc ) method that has been developed recently and is discussed in detail in ref .",
    "in addition , magneto - optical absorption spectral measurements were performed using a streak camera ; these measurements were conducted using a horizontal single - turn coil ( hstc ) method , and the optical system was set up in a manner similar to that described in ref .",

    "the sample temperature was monitored by an au - fe / chromel thermocouple attached adjacent to the sample . in the case of hstc ,",

    "a powdered sample of cdcr@xmath0o@xmath1 was used for magnetization measurements ; the net mass was 5.4 mg .",
    "the value of magnetic field was measured using a calibrated pick - up coil wound near the sample .",
    "the estimated error of the value of the magnetic field was less than 3@xmath14 .",
    "figure 1 shows both the derivative , @xmath15 , of the magnetization curve , and its integrated @xmath16 curve , obtained for cdcr@xmath4o@xmath5 at 4.2 k in magnetic fields up to 120 t by the induction method using a magnetic pickup coil  @xcite .",
    "the full - magnetization curve is in fairly good agreement with those obtained previously using the faraday rotation measurement method  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath15 curve showed sharp peaks at around 28 t as well as a hysteresis in elevating and descending processes of the magnetic field .",
    "this indicates a first - order phase transition between the antiferromagnetic phase and the half - magnetization plateau phase .",

    "as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , this step - like structure indicates a second - order phase transition between the half - magnetization plateau phase and a canted 3:1 phase .",
    "in addition , for the @xmath15 curve , we observed peaks at 74 t ( for descending magnetic field ) and 77 t ( for elevating process ) , indicating the existence of a first - order phase transition . although this transition was observed earlier by mitamura _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , only the descending magnetic field process of the @xmath15 curve from 80 t was shown in their data , because owing to a large starting trigger noise , it was difficult to analyze the signal in the elevating magnetic field process .",
    "a new observation in the present study is a step - like structure that appears in the @xmath15 curve at around 88 t , which should be considered the phase transition to the fully polarized phase .",
    "the present data showed the existence of a new magnetic phase between 74  77 t and 88 t. this new phase can not be explained within the existing framework of the bilinear - biquadratic model developed by penc _",

    "was observed at 28 t , where the first - order phase transition occurred , being accompanied by change of magnetic and crystal structures as described in ref .",
    "furthermore , for the emp transition below 28 t , there is a clearly observable large difference between the absorption intensities of the elevating and descending magnetic field processes .",
    "this might indicate that for magnetic fields below 28 t , magnetic and/or crystal structures were different between the two processes .",
    "one possible explanation of this behavior is that the magnetic domain orientation and fast sweep rate of magnetic fields ( @xmath1260 t/@xmath13s ) caused the large hysteresis behavior .",
    "in fact , neutron scattering measurements of cdcr@xmath0o@xmath1 in fields of up to 30 t exhibited hysteresis behavior that arose from magnetic domain orientation at @xmath128 t ( sweep rate in those experiments was @xmath1240005000 times slower than in our experiments )  @xcite .",
    "an additional indication of the change of crystal and magnetic structures are anomalies of absorption intensity at 74 t in these transitions , corresponding to the first - order phase transition that is observed in fig .",
    "1 . we consider that this change of crystal structure occurred to relieve the lattice distortion that emerged from the geometrical frustration and turned into a higher symmetric structure .",
    "in addition , a change of the lattice structure would persist up to the magnetic field of 88 t , because absorption intensity in the @xmath17 transition ( which reflects the crystal field ) exhibits a monotonic increase up to 88 t , until it becomes almost constant . on the other hand , for emp transition ,",
    "the absorption intensity was completely suppressed above 88 t , because excitation of a magnon with @xmath18 is substantially restricted in the fully polarized phase  @xcite .",
    "these behaviors of absorption intensity in cdcr@xmath0o@xmath1 are very similar to those observed in the vicinity of the fully polarized phase in zncr@xmath0o@xmath1 , indicating the existence of the novel phase in both species of chromium spinel oxides .",

    "of which the saturated magnetization moment is reached for much lower magnetic fields , it has been difficult to conduct magneto - optical absorption spectral measurements , because only polycrystalline samples are available . however , the behavior of the @xmath15 curve was very similar to that observed in the present case  @xcite .",

    "a spin system is compared with a boson system such as @xmath8he , and the discussion was developed in the similar system of zncr@xmath0o@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "@xmath27 components of spins break the translational symmetry in a magnetic `` solid '' state , and their @xmath28 and @xmath29 components break spin rotational symmetry in a magnetic `` superfluid '' state  @xcite .",
    "a magnetic `` supersolid '' state has both properties , whereas the translational and spin rotational symmetries are both maintained in a magnetic `` liquid '' state  @xcite . in general , the supersolid state exists between the solid and the superfluid states in the phase diagram , because a direct transition from a liquid state to a supersolid state or vice versa require simultaneous breaking of the translational and the spin rotational symmetries , which could occur with less possibility .",
    "therefore , the novel magnetic phase , which is located between a supersolid state ( canted 3:1 phase ) and a liquid state ( fully polarized phase ) , should be a superfluid state as was discussed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , present experimental results reveled that the magnetic structure and the crystal structure become highly symmetric in the novel phase under discussion .",

    "the magnetic structures of both candidates are highly symmetric , and break the spin rotational symmetries .",
    "interestingly , the existence of the umbrella - like magnetic structure prior to the fully polarized phase was also discussed for the case of cufeo@xmath0 , which is regarded as a geometrically frustrated magnet with a triangular lattice  @xcite . in this compound , as well as in chromium spinel oxides ,",

    ", a sequence of magnetic phases appeared , similar to what has been observed for chromium spinel oxides  @xcite .",

    "these compounds might have a common underlying mechanism to stabilize the umbrella - like magnetic structure .",
    "thus , one way to explain the stabilization of the umbrella phase is to consider the additional classical effects that favor noncollinear magnetic structures . as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , if a coefficient of the biquadratic term changes its sign , noncollinear magnetic structures will be favored and the umbrella phase will stabilize prior to the fully polarized phase . however , in the bilinear - biquadratic model proposed by penc _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , the sign of the coefficient is not likely to change .",
    "therefore , additional terms should be incorporated into the bilinear - biquadratic model .",
    "in fact , a magnetic structure that is observed in the half - magnetization plateau phase of cdcr@xmath0o@xmath1  @xcite indicates the necessity of additional terms such as three - site spin - lattice interactions suggested by bergman _",
    "et al . _",
    "such interaction makes the magnetic structure less collinear .",
    "therefore , if the contributions from the additional terms such as the above - described interaction become more dominant than those from the biquadratic terms , the umbrella phase might exist prior to the fully polarized phase .",
    "another possibility is to consider quantum effects",
    ". a magnon picture would be useful to understand the magnetic properties in the vicinity of a saturated moment .",
    "if the magnetic field is sufficiently high , the fully polarized phase becomes the ground state .",
    "a one - magnon state is represented as the state in which the quantum number @xmath27 is lowered by 1 . in the umbrella phase , magnons are uniformly distributed throughout the lattice , whereas the canted 3:1 phase is characterized by partial magnon localization .",
    "the energy difference between both states depends on interactions between magnons . in chromium spinel oxides",
    ", quantum effects might cause the interaction that favors the umbrella phase prior to the fully polarized phase .    from this viewpoint ,",
    "a two - magnon bound state bose - einstein condensation , a spin nematic phase , could occur in the vicinity of a fully polarized phase under certain conditions of magnon - magnon interactions  @xcite .",
    "experimental observations of the spin nematic phase prior to a fully polarized phase were recently reported for the frustrated chain compound licuvo@xmath1 , in which the nearest neighbor ferromagnetic and the next nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions stabilize the spin nematic phase  @xcite .",
    "stabilization of the spin nematic phase in bilinear - biquadratic model with quantum effects was suggested earlier  @xcite .",
    "_ reported that the spin nematic phase could exist prior to the fully polarized phase in the @xmath31 = 1 bilinear - biquadratic heisenberg model on a triangular lattice  @xcite .",
    "similarly , there would be no reason to exclude the possibility of the spin nematic phase in chromium spinel oxides that are well described by the bilinear - biquadratic heisenberg model on pyrochlore lattice .    a more sophisticated model that accounts for the higher - order spin - lattice interactions , quantum effects , and so forth",
    "is required to clarify the magnetic structure of the novel phase universally observed in the series of chromium spinel oxides .",
