    "<S> @xcite , fermionic statistics plus superconductivity by itself produces majorana fermions , irrespective of considerations of dimensionality , topology , or broken symmetries .    here </S>",
    "<S> we propose an experiment to probe the majorana nature of bogoliubov quasiparticles in conventional , nontopological , superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> existing proposals apply to topological superconductors @xcite , where majorana fermions appear as charge - neutral edge states with a distinct signature in dc transport experiments . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the bogoliubov quasiparticles of a nontopological superconductor have charge expectation value @xmath8 , so their majorana nature remains hidden in the energy domain probed by dc transport .    </S>",

    "<S> andreev reflection in the quantum hall effect regime has been reported in inas quantum wells @xcite and in graphene monolayers @xcite . in graphene , which has small spin - orbit coupling , </S>",
    "<S> the andreev reflected hole is in the opposite spin band as the electron ( spin - singlet pairing ) . the strong spin - orbit coupling in inas permits spin - triplet pairing ( electron and hole in the same spin band ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we contrast these two cases by taking a twofold spin - degenerate edge channel for spin - singlet pairing and one single spin - polarized edge channel for spin - triplet pairing . for spin - singlet pairing </S>",

    "<S> the difference is that the term with @xmath30 is a single - particle process ( relaxation of a quasiparticle from energy @xmath44 ) , while the term with @xmath45 is a two - particle process ( pairwise annihilation of quasiparticles at energy @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) . </S>",

    "<S> the amplitude of the nonlocal josephson oscillations depends quadratically on this ratio , so for @xmath119 ( in a @xmath120 magnetic field ) one would hope for a @xmath121 below @xmath122 .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have proposed an experiment for bogoliubov quasiparticles that is the condensed matter analogue of the way in which majorana fermions are searched for in particle physics @xcite : by detecting their pairwise annihilation upon collision . </S>",
    "<S> the majorana fermions in a topologically trivial superconductor lack the non - abelian statistics and the associated nonlocality of majorana zero - modes in a topological superconductor @xcite , but a different kind of nonlocality remains : we have found that the annihilation probability of quasiparticles originating from two identical superconductors depends on their phase difference  even in the absence of any supercurrent coupling . </S>",
    "<S> observation of the @xmath113 oscillations of the annihilation probability would provide a striking demonstration of the majorana nature of bogoliubov quasiparticles .    </S>",
    "<S> i dedicate this paper to the memory of markus bttiker . </S>",
    "<S> i have benefited from discussions with a. r. akhmerov and from the support by the foundation for fundamental research on matter ( fom ) , the netherlands organization for scientific research ( nwo / ocw ) , and an erc synergy grant . </S>"
