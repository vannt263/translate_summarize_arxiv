    "more concretely , can the many light scalar fields ( moduli ) that arise in string compactifications acquire potentials that lead to slow roll inflation or quintessence , or perhaps can they be stabilized at a positive potential minimum giving a small cosmological constant ? expanding universes often begin in a big bang  can such spacelike curvature singularities including the ones inside schwarzschild black holes be resolved in string theory ?",

    "[ fig : desitter ]",
    "the relation between euclidean ads and lorentzian de sitter space , and in particular the shared asymptotic structure suggests that it might be possible to give a holographic dual to de sitter in terms of a euclidean conformal field theory @xcite . a basic argument against such a possibility arises from the entropy of de sitter space .",
    "as seen by an inertial observer ( [ dsstatic ] ) , de sitter space has a cosmological horizon .",
    "associating an entropy with this area leads to @xmath38 the introduction of matter into de sitter space causes the cosmological horizon to _ contract _ towards the inertial observer with the net effect that total entropy ( matter + horizons ) , rather unusually , is _ reduced _ by the introduction of matter ( including black holes ) @xcite : @xmath39 various arguments for and interpretations of this entropy are discussed in @xcite . in particular , given that a round sphere is euclidean de sitter space ( [ dseuclid1 ] ) , we could regard the sphere in @xmath40 compactifications as euclidean de sitter space and estimate the number of degrees of freedom in the cft dual to ads that are required to describe dynamics within the sphere .",
    "it is interesting that this number scales exactly like the de sitter entropy ( [ dsentropy ] ) @xcite .",
    "for example , regard the @xmath41 compactification of string theory ( with scale @xmath42 and dual to @xmath43 gauge theory ) as @xmath44 .",
    "we would then associate an entropy @xmath45 with the `` de sitter '' factor where @xmath42 is the scale of the sphere and @xmath46 is the 5d newton constant . the last equation is obtained by translating from spacetime to dual field theory variables @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the dual @xmath43 field theory has @xmath47 degrees of freedom in its matrices and these are indeed used to describe the dynamics of the sphere .",
    "the gravitational entropy of black holes was the original inspiration for the holographic principle @xcite which states that this entropy is a measure of the actual number of accessible states .",
    "( for a review see @xcite . ) for a black hole we usually view the entropy as measuring the number of microstates that are consistent with the macroscopic charges . but in a cosmological setting the interpretation is more problematic .",
    "first of all , in a general expanding universe the classic bekenstein - hawking entropy bound has to be generalized to involve not the area bounding a volume at fixed time , but rather a lightsheet emanating from such a surface , in order to correctly account for the entropies of matter flowing into and out of a region @xcite .",
    "in fact , in the simple case of empty de sitter space the formula ( [ dsentropy ] ) suffices .",
    "nevertheless there is an interpretational problem because each inertial observer in de sitter space sees a horizon to which he or she might assign an entropy .",
    "how then should we interpret the entropy ?",
    "is it a quantity measuring the physics accessible to a fixed observer , or does it refer to the universe as a whole ?    notably , fischler @xcite and banks @xcite have argued that we should interpret de sitter entropy as indicating a finite dimensional hilbert space of excitations for the entire universe , a situation that usually arises when a system is described by a topological theory or if there is a fundamental discreteness of variables .",
    "this is a radical proposal  indeed , neither field theory nor perturbative string theory would lead us to expect a finite dimensional hilbert space .",
    "this interpretation also requires a form of  horizon complementarity \" in which the degrees of freedom measured by a given inertial observer , and contributing to his or her measured entropy , must be  complementary \" or in some sense equivalent to the degrees of freedom seen by any other inertial observer .",
    "it has been argued that black holes enjoy such a principle of complementarity @xcite , but requiring it of cosmological horizons is an additional step .",
    "banks and fischler have argued that there is such principle of horizon complementarity and that it can help in defining the analog of an s - matrix to describe the observations made by an inertial observer in de sitter space @xcite .    in any case , if the dimension of the hilbert space is indeed finite , the spacetime can not be dual to a cft  indeed , a single harmonic oscillator has an infinite dimensional hilbert space . yet",
    "another argument @xcite states that if de sitter space has a finite entropy as in ( [ dsentropy ] ) , we should expect poincare recurrences in the dynamics seen by an inertial observer .",
    "it is difficult to imagine how this would be reproduced in a dual cft with an infinite number of degrees of freedom .    despite these important objections ,",
    "it is a productive exercise to examine what the structure of a dual to de sitter would have to be like , given the known properties of de sitter space @xcite . besides elucidating various aspects of the symmetries and dynamics of de sitter , thinking in this way has led to two important new results : ( a ) we obtain a definition of mass in an asymptotically de sitter universe , a new result in classical gravity @xcite , ( b ) in an inflating universe , or one with a positive cosmological constant , one can productively organize equations describing flow in time as a sort of renormalization group flow .",
    "the definition of mass also leads to a positive mass conjecture  de sitter space has the largest mass of any nonsingular spacetime with a given cosmological constant .",
    "spaces with a larger mass are conjectured to develop singularities . in this way",
    ", the finiteness of de sitter entropy can be consistent with an infinite dimensional hilbert space ",
    "most states have too much mass and lead to singular evolution , and therefore will not be accounted for by the entropy of the horizons of non - singular spaces with a positive cosmological constant .",
    "the sections below rapidly review various proposals for defining de sitter holography and focus on the results ( a ) and ( b ) described above .",
    "given the relation with ads described above , it is clear that the asymptotic symmetry group of de sitter space will be the euclidean conformal group .",
    "this analogy suggests that the holographic dual to de sitter space will involve a euclidean cft .",
    "however , the ads / cft correspondence contains three other ingredients that are lacking in de sittter space : ( a ) a dictionary mapping bulk fields in a specific stringy realization into boundary data , ( b ) an argument for correctness in terms of a decoupling limit on a stack of branes , and ( c ) a defining equation , @xmath48 which relates the spacetime partition function as a functional of boundary data @xmath49 to the generating function of correlation functions of a dual .    nevertheless , we can attempt proceed by analogy , and by using symmetry .",
    "an important difference compared to ads space is that de sitter space has two conformal boundaries @xmath23 which are in causal contact .",
    "we might try to formulate the de sitter analog of ( [ adscftdef ] ) @xmath50 but there are several challenges to doing this .",
    "for example , de sitter space does not enjoy the classic ads division of mode solutions into  normalizable \" modes representing states in the bulk and in the dual , and ",
    "non - normalizable modes \" representing both boundary conditions for the bulk and sources in the dual field theory .",
    "even more problematically the left hand side of this equation is a lorentzian path integral and thus complex while the right hand side , defined on the euclidean boundaries is naively real .",
    "these subtleties led strominger to propose that de sitter space is dual to a cft defined on one of the two de sitter boundaries @xcite .",
    "he suggested that the two boundaries be identified by an antipodal map , essentially since a light ray starting at a given point on the sphere at @xmath51 reaches the antipodal point on the sphere at @xmath52 .",
    "he proposed to then define the correlation functions of a cft dual to de sitter space by generalizing the perturbative formulae in @xcite .",
    "schematically the two - point function of the dual theory would be written in terms of a bulk - boundary propagator @xmath10 as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a derivative in the direction normal to the boundary at @xmath55 , @xmath10 is a bulk - to - boundary propagator computed by rescaling the boundary limit of the feynman propagator , @xmath56 are boundary points , and @xmath8 is the boundary metric .",
    "the detailed expressions of course differ in the different de sitter coordinate systems .",
    "also there is a question of whether we should associate operators with each of the two boundaries and how we deal with the fact that unlike ads , all mode solutions are normalizable .",
    "( see @xcite for a review of the proposal and extension to the different coordinate systems . )",
    "while this definition can be made and computed with , its meaning and usefulness remain unclear in the absence of a concrete embedding within string theory .",
    "another approach , exploiting the relation between the isometry groups and the asymptotic boundaries of euclidean ads and de sitter , is to try to find a bijective map between de sitter data and eads that preserves all the symmetries .",
    "if such a map exists we could map all data on @xmath57 into @xmath58 , and the euclidean cft that is dual to eads would also describe de sitter space .",
    "in fact , such a map preserving the @xmath37 isometry can be constructed : @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are fields on de sitter and eads respectively .",
    "this map , which is nonlocal by construction , maps the two boundaries of de sitter into the single eads boundary by an antipodal map .",
    "this seems promising , and agrees nicely with the antipodal map in strominger s proposal , but it transpires that @xmath62 has a nonzero kernel , so information is lost in the map from de sitter to eads .",
    "this suggests that a single euclidean field theory can not be sufficient to describe de sitter physics holographically .",
    "regardless of whether there is a holographic description of de sitter space , the relation between ds and eads asymptopia leads to the solution of a long standing puzzle about asymptotically de sitter spaces : how do we measure the mass of something placed in such a universe ? in a theory of gravity there is no good local prescription for measuring mass and thus we usually resort to the adm procedure which involves surrounding a matter distribution by a large sphere and observing the asymptotic effects on that sphere of the back - reaction on the metric . in effect , this is a gravitational equivalent of using gauss law to measure electric charges .",
    "unfortunately , since the spatial sections of de sitter space are compact , this procedure must also lead to a vanishing mass .",
    "how then do we define and compare the masses of , say , different stars in a closed universe with a positive cosmological constant ?    to begin , consider the action ( [ dsaction1 ] ) .",
    "following @xcite we can try to define the mass of an asymptotically ds space by constructing a euclidean quasilocal stress tensor on either boundary @xmath23 @xmath63 and then contracting with the killing vector @xmath64 that is timelike for @xmath65 in the static patch ( [ dsstatic ] ) and spacelike as @xmath66 at @xmath23 : @xmath67 here @xmath68 is the killing vector corresponding to @xmath69 , need only exist near the boundaries and it will do so at @xmath9 in any asymptotically de sitter spacetime . ] and we decomposed the boundary metric as @xmath70 the problem , as in ads space , is that the action ( [ dsaction1 ] ) diverges because of the large volume at infinity and consequently so does @xmath71 . in ads",
    "space we understand this in term of the dual field theory  the effective action and the stress tensor diverge because of the standard local divergences appearing in the definition of composite operators . in field theory",
    "the divergences are removed by adding local counterterms which in turn translates into an improvement of the gravitational action by the addition of local boundary terms that do not affect the equations of motion since they are constructed out of intrinsic boundary data @xcite .",
    "( a useful review is @xcite . )    because of the asymptotic relation between de sitter space and euclidean space , the same prescription must work in asymptotically de sitter spaces independently of whether there is a holographic dual @xcite .",
    "we therefore improve the action ( [ dsaction1 ] ) by the addition of @xmath72 the second term applies when @xmath73 .",
    "the resulting action is finite for @xmath74 , up to terms related to the conformal anomaly  a complete analysis of this anomaly and how to treat the associated divergences in both ads and de sitter is presented in @xcite .",
    "evaluating the stress tensor on @xmath51 gives @xmath75 \\ , , { \\label{stressminus}}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the extrinsic curvature and @xmath76 is the einstein tensor of the instrinsic boundary metric @xmath77 .",
    "according to this definition , the mass assigned to black holes in de sitter space is always less than the mass of de sitter .",
    "in effect , adding matter to the spacetime has causes the spacetime to  shrink \" and the net loss of vacuum energy from @xmath78 always exceeds the net increase due to matter .",
    "for example , in three dimensions , adding a pointlike matter source to de sitter space creates a conical defect spacetime ( see e.g , @xcite ) : @xmath79 here @xmath80 with equality for pure de sitter .",
    "the above formulae lead to @xmath81 so that de sitter space has the maximum mass in this class .",
    "this result is in attractive correspondence with the fact ( [ dsentbound ] ) that empty de sitter space always has a larger entropy than de sitter with any combination of matter and black holes in it .",
    "this correspondence suggests a maximum mass theorem for de sitter space :    * maximum mass conjecture * : _ any spacetime that is asymptotically de sitter in the past and has a mass exceeding that of de sitter develops a cosmological singularity . _",
    "this conjecture has passed many tests @xcite .",
    "an interesting recent paper of clarkson , ghezelbash and mann finds a spacetime which exceeds the de sitter bound , and does not apparently have a singularity @xcite .",
    "however , this space has closed timelike curves .",
    "the classic problem with such spaces is that the boundary of the region of ctcs will be consist of closed null curves along which the stress tensor of any standard field will diverge .",
    "this phenomenon , which is at the core of the chronology protection conjecture @xcite , will cause the example of @xcite to develop a singularity . it would interesting to directly attempt to prove the maximum mass conjecture .",
    "since the mass formula is constructed in terms of the extrinsic curvature of the spacetime boundary , standard techniques using the raychaudhuri equation and focussing theorems might lead to progress .",
    "if such a maximum mass conjecture is correct in some form , it also points to a route whereby the finite entropy de sitter space can be consistent with a field theoretic dual  most initial states would lead to singular evolution and the horizon entropy counts the finite number of initial states leading to non - singular spacetimes .",
    "in fact , assuming that 3d de sitter space is dual to a cft , and naively applying the cardy formula using energies and central charges derived from ( [ stressminus ] ) gives an exact account of the entropy of the kerr - de sitter spacetimes @xcite in three dimensions .",
    "however , some care is required in carrying out such formal procedures , since the unitary representations of the de sitter algebra are not in standard highest weight representations of the conformal group . for more on the latter point and possible consequences for a string theory in de sitter space",

    "[ time - as - rg - flow ] ] time as rg flow : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    thinking about de sitter space in the language of the boundary data as described above also leads to a deeper question about the nature of time . in the ads",

    "this relation was made precise in hamiltonian language in @xcite and in wilsonian language in @xcite .",
    "essentially , radial flow in ads is related to renormalization group flow in the dual field theory  the bulk radial coordinate `` emerges '' dyanmically from the field theory as is associated with the field theory rg scale .",

    "while some progress can be made using symmetries as discussed above , it is essential to find accelerating universes as controlled solutions of string theory .",
    "a major impediment in this regard is a no go theorem that says , in effect , that no smooth classical compactification of m - theory with lead to an accelerating universe @xcite . in some ways",
    "this theorem is reminiscent of the result that no smooth compactification of m theory will lead to chiral fermions @xcite . as it turned out compactification of m theory on a classically singular manifold , i.e. an interval , gives the heterotic string with chiral fermions @xcite .",
    "other escape routes from the no go theorems include the presence of a small internal manifold and thus large @xmath82 corrections in string theory , as well as non - perturtabative effects that are absent in the classical lagrangian . of course , if supersymmetry is broken it is essentially inevitable that a positive cosmological constant is generated  the challenge is keeping it under control .",
    "these loopholes have led to a variety of tactics for constructing accelerating universes in string theory .",
    "hull has argued that the type ii@xmath83 string theories , which result from timelike t - duality , have euclidean branes the near - horizon limits of which realize de sitter space @xcite .",
    "this seems like a tempting scenario in which to realize de sitter holography , but the challenge is making sense of the type ii@xmath83 theories .",
    "the low energy action contains wrong sign kinetic terms which arise originally from the timelike t - duality , an intermediate step involving circular time and therefore closed timelike curves .",

    "it would be interesting explore how this works in the ii@xmath83 setting .",
    "another tactic to evade the no - go theorems forbidding accelerating universes arising from m - theory compactifications is to to explicitly consider classically singular or near - singular compactification manifolds . by including extra stringy states ( e.g. wrapped branes or string that become light near such points it can be possible to construct a smooth low - energy effective action despite the classical singularity ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it has been shown that exciting such extra states can lead to periods of accelerated expansion @xcite though it is unlikely that inflation can be implemented in this way since the duration of the expansion is typically too short .",
    "interestingly , the near - singular region of the internal manifold in these cases is dynamically preferred  once the moduli scalars enter this region , they tend to stay there .",
    "an interesting effort to construct de sitter vacua of string theory involves asymmetric orientifolds in super - critical string theories @xcite .",
    "these works argue that by turning on fluxes in such models it is possible to stabilize all moduli in a classically reliable region at a positive extremum of the potential .",
    "this results in a metastable de sitter space .",
    "traditionally super - critical string theories have been avoided because of runaway behaviours of the dilaton , but in the models of @xcite dilaton tadpoles from non - criticality are balanced against tadpoles coming from the fluxes . although the reliability of perturbation theory in such settings is not fully understood , this is a potentially promising approach that shares many features with the more recent constructions of @xcite",
    ".    another interesting approach to finding accelerating universes involves dimensionally reducing string theory on a compact hyperbolic manifold @xcite .",
    "one might fear that this would give rise to wrong sign kinetic terms in the low - energy action on the non - compact space , but there are in fact stable examples in which the non - compact space enjoys a period of acceleration @xcite .",
    "the period of acceleration is not long enough to model inflation in the early universe , but this nevertheless an interesting development .",
    "some possibilities for accelerating phases in compactifications on a hyperbolic manifold with flux are classified in @xcite . interestingly",
    ", these spacetimes also arise as special cases @xcite of the s - brane solutions @xcite that have been of interest in the context of decaying branes in string theory @xcite .",
    "the latter context might provide a situation where one directly finds a dual description to a time - dependent universe in terms of a euclidean theory on a decaying brane .",
    "in particular , the `` half - branes '' studied in @xcite represent a soliton that is present at the beginning of time and decays entirely into closed strings @xcite .",
    "one might have hoped that some sort of decoupling limit of the open - string theory on such decaying branes would give a holographic description of a region of the associated time - dependent spacetimes @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , most attempts to find such spacetimes have led to singular solutions , but very recently , partly inspired by observations in @xcite , non - singular solutions have been found for a class of decaying branes @xcite .",

    "the techniques for computing scattering amplitudes from decaying branes are under active development ( see @xcite ) .",
    "given the idea that the observed cosmological constant and inflation could arise from the potential energy of a scalar field it is natural to try to use the many light moduli fields generated in typical string compactifications for this purpose .",
    "typically , however , these fields are difficult to stabilize and when they acquire potentials they tend to be runaways that lead to decompactification to 10 dimensions",
    ". that might be acceptable if the roll rate were slow enough , but this can also be be hard to achieve in traditional perturbative string compactifications @xcite .",
    "however , recently , it has been realized that many moduli can be stabilized by turning on fluxes on a compactification manifold .",
    "the basic phenomenon , described for example in @xcite , occurs because the pressures generated by the flux threading non - trivial cycles of a compactification manifold make fluctuations in the shape and size of the cycle more energetically expensive .",

    "step ( iii ) in the kklt construction is to stabilize the kahler moduli using non - perturbative effects that depend on the kahler structure .",
    "the two important effects considered in @xcite are :    1 .   * brane instantons * : witten @xcite argued that euclidean d3-brane instantons wrapping certain divisors @xmath123 of the f - theory four - fold @xmath84 , which project to 4-cycles in the base @xmath71 on which the iib string theory compactified , will make a contribution to the superpotential .",
    "this will be of the general form @xmath124 where @xmath125 is a one - loop , complex - structure dependent contribution and @xmath126 is the volume of the divisor wrapped by the instanton .",

    "for some examples , see @xcite . as argued in kklt , the fact that the complex structure moduli have already been frozen implies that all charged matter ( which could be used to separate the branes ) has already acquired a mass at a high scale .",
    "so at low energies , the pure @xmath43 theory will confine via gaugino condensation and will make a non - perturbative contribution to the superpotential that behaves as @xmath129 . again @xmath130 will be a quadratic expression in terms of the 2-cycle moduli appearing in the kahler potential ( [ kahlerpot ] ) .    to make further progress",
    "we must know how many kahler moduli there are because the effects of the contributions from these two effects may not depend on all of them .    for the moment",
    "let us assume that @xmath131 so that there is only one kahler modulus .",

    "their kahler parameter is square of the one appearing in ( [ ksimp ] ) . )",
    "then , including the non - perturbative effects described above , the general form of the superpotential is @xmath133 where @xmath116 is the tree level superpotential and @xmath134 and @xmath135 are some @xmath136 constants that can depend on the complex structure moduli whose values have already been frozen classically .",
    "recall that at tree level @xmath137 was required for supersymmetry in order to ensure that @xmath138 .",
    "but now , including the non - perturbative effects , the condition for a susy vacuum @xmath20 gives the condition @xmath139 we are setting @xmath140 , where sigma is the real volume of the 2-cycle associated to @xmath109 .",
    "by solving ( [ susyext ] ) we find the stabilized volume of @xmath71 ( @xmath141 ) in terms of @xmath116 .",

    "2a where we have assumed @xmath142 .",
    "because @xmath143 , at the single extremum ( which is supersymmetric and given by ( [ susyext ] ) ) we have an ads vacuum . when @xmath144 the potential remains a runaway . solving to get an extremum in the classically controlled region of large kahler modulus it is necessary to fine tune",
    "@xmath116 relative to @xmath134 and @xmath135 by selecting a suitable set of stabilized complex structure parameters ( see @xcite for acceptable ranges ) .",
    "[ fig : potentials ]    this is already an interesting scenario where all moduli have been frozen . to get a de sitter vacuum",
    ", supersymmetry will have to be broken . to do this in a controlled way , kklt oversaturate the flux contribution to the right hand side of the consistency condition ( [ consistent ] ) , and",
    "then compensate by adding an anti - d3 brane .",
    "one might have thought that an anti - d3 brane added to a scenario where fluxes are creating an effective d3 brane charge would lead to catastrophic instability .",
    "however , this is not the case @xcite , essentially because it is difficult for a localized object like a brane to annihilate with a delocalized flux . in some cases there",
    "are perturbative instabilities , but in general this system of an anti - d3 in a background of d3 fluxes decays to the supersymmetric vacuum where the anti - d3 has decayed via a non - perturbative process of bubble nucleation which annihilates one unit of flux .",
    "the lifetime of the metastable state with an anti - d3 in it depends on the details , but can easily be very long @xcite . the oversaturated flux and the anti d3-brane make contributions to the potential that go as @xmath145 where the second equality applies in the single kahler parameter case with @xmath140 . to understand the @xmath146 scaling note first that the energy of the added flux and that of the anti - d3 will scale in the same way .",
    "the 3-form flux makes a contribution of the form @xmath147 which involves three inverse factors of the metric in the contraction of the indices of the 3-form @xmath148 .",
    "there is also one integration over @xmath71 .",
    "this gives a net scaling of @xmath149 .",
    "converting from the 4d string frame to the 4d einstein frame involves a factor of @xmath150 , giving the net scaling of @xmath151 in ( [ deltav ] ) .",
    "( incidentally , the same reasoning is responsible for the overall scaling with @xmath152 of the potential ( [ fullpotential ] ) and the factor of 2 in front of the kahler potential ( [ kahlerpot ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath153 depends on the geometry at the location in the calabi - yau where the anti - d3 brane is placed .",

    "in particular , this affects the classical reliability of the metastable de sitter and its stability .",
    "detailed estimates are given by the authors of @xcite under various plausible assumptions .",
    "they argue that it should be possible to tune the fluxes so that the de sitter extremum has a small cosmological constant ( small @xmath122 ) and a large lifetime ( high barrier ) .",

    "the procedure feels contrived because every trick in the book has been used . on the other ,",
    "it is very reasonable in the sense that all the standard phenomena we are used to have come into play , and no exotic new phenomena had to be identified . the urgent question then becomes finding an explicit realization to see whether the proposed scenario can be naturally embedded in an example .",

    ", @xmath123 must lift to a divisor of @xmath84 with arithmetic genus 1 . to achieve this",

    "this is a model with two kahler moduli .",
    "indeed , the 3-brane instanton can not appear in models with only a single khler modulus @xcite . in order for all khler moduli to be stabilized by 3-brane instantons , there must be a basis for the khler form in which each associated divisor has arithmetic genus 1 . in typical simple examples with a small number of kahler moduli the action of the instanton",
    "does not depend on all the kahler parameters . as a result",
    ", it turns out that there can be a supersymmetric extremum of the nonperturbatively corrected potential , but the extremum occurs on the wall of the kahler cone @xcite .",
    "thus , in general the instanton effects might stabilize all the khler moduli , but they will do so in a region outside classical control , with large stringy corrections .",
    "nevertheless , denef , douglas and florea @xcite have shown , using results of grassi @xcite , that there are many examples of models in which _ all _ khler moduli are stabilized at reasonably large volumes by instantons . this explicitly demonstrates the feasibility of the kklt scenario .",
    "gaugino condensation effects will enlarge the class of models in which all the moduli are stabilized .",
    "some explicit examples have been studied in @xcite , but all the moduli are not stabilized in these cases .",
    "further examples will appear in @xcite    if supersymmetry is broken by adding an anti - d3 brane as in kklt , there will be perturbative corrections to the superpotential .",
    "this is the traditional cosmological constant problem in which the corrections to the potential go as @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the susy breaking scale @xcite .",
    "these corrections will certainly increase the value of the cosmological constant and could destabilize the de sitter extremum in some models .",

    "2b to get a small cosmological constant , it would appear that there is a small classical breaking scale .",
    "on the other hand , if we look at the amount of energy added in going from the ads vacuum to the ds vacuum it would appear that the scale is much larger .",
    "this uplift energy comes from the additional fluxes and anti - d3 brane , so we might say that the breaking scale on the added brane is large . but",
    "this will get communicated to the bulk via interactions , so the corrections to the potential will be sizable .",
    "kklt have checked that within their assumptions these corrections do not destabilize their extremum , but this is an issue that should be paid attention to in constructing such models .",
    "( see @xcite for two explorations of quantum corrections to the basic kklt scenario . ) also , it should also be noted that the khler potential , even with @xmath158 supersymmetry , receives @xmath159 corrections from from perturbative effects and worldsheet instantons @xcite . orientifolding to get @xmath16",
    "susy will increase the class of corrections that appear .",
    "these have the potential to qualitiatively change the structure of the effective scalar potential in some situations @xcite , even possibly leading to susy breaking and metastable de sitter minima .",
    "a central problem of string theory is to give an account of why our world looks the way it does given the vast number of apparently consistent vacua with the wrong number of dimensions , too much ( super)symmetry , wrong gauge groups and particle content etc .",
    "one might have hoped that non - perturbative considerations would select four dimensions and low energy particle spectra resembling ours as somehow desirable or unique , but the reverse has happened .",
    "we have shown in great detail , particularly with the understanding of field theoretic and stringy dualities , that the over - symmetric vacua of string theory are self - consistent and can not be eliminated .",
    "what then selects the vacuum we live in ?    the kklt picture of moduli stabilization and the emergence of de sitter space suggests a picture of string theory in which there is a potential landscape with many supersymmetric flat regions , non - supersymmetric peaks , valleys and canyons , ads extrema , metastable de sitter regions etc .",
    "( see @xcite for a recent commentary on such a  landscape \" within which the universe evolves .",
    "some exploration of the landscape occurs in @xcite . )",
    "the idea of such a landscape goes hand - in - hand with the idea of a _ discretuum _ @xcite which states that the less symmetric vacua of string theory relevant to our world are arranged in a dense set of discrete points after moduli stabilization rather than as a well - separated isolated points or on a continuum manifold .",
    "certainly , this is the indication of the kklt construction of @xmath16 vacua in the context of generic flux compactifications . in particular @xcite",

    "the latter authors also proposed that the resulting cosmological constant could dynamically neutralize itself by membrane nucleation .",
    "the necessary flux is naturally obtained in m - theory compactifications to 4-dimensions by compactifying the 7-form flux in 11-dimensions on non - trivial 3-cycles of the internal manifold .",
    "the resulting fluxes can only take quantized values , which initially suggests that the mechanism of @xcite will not be viable since the steps in which the cosmological constant can be changed would exceed the current bounds .",
    "however , it is important that in a typical compactification , there will be a great many such 2-cycles in the internal space and hence many different 4-form fluxes in the four noncompact dimensions .",
    "bousso and polchinski observed that the net cosmological constant would be @xmath160 where they assumed a large negative bare cosmological constant @xmath161 and the @xmath162 are the contributions to the ground state energy from @xmath163 quanta of each kind of 4-form .",
    "the key point is that we can find cosmological constants within acceptable bounds @xmath164 by locating all points within the @xmath163 charge lattice that lie within a distance @xmath165 of a sphere of radius @xmath166 centered at @xmath167 .",
    "it is then elementary to notice that despite the discreteness of @xmath163 there will be a great many lattice points in the acceptable region !",
    "this observation potentially makes possible an anthropic selection principle for the cosmological constant @xcite , since it becomes more reasonable to argue that , given some bound on the total energy density in the system , there is a finite probability to wind up in a vacuum with a cosmological constant like ours .",
    "one might even try to argue for different regions of the universe , separated by domain walls , where the cosmological constant takes different values , and say that we simply live in a region that permits life .",
    "although the kklt scenario does not solve the cosmological constant per se , and does not use precisely the mechanism in ( [ bp ] ) , the presence of a great number of fluxes in the compact manifold raises similar issues concerning a dense discrete set of vacua with similar properties .",
    "it has been argued in this context that vacuum selection in string theory will have to be anthropic  the best we can do is identify the region of discrete vacua that are phenomenologically acceptable @xcite .",
    "all the other vacua are viable too , but they are not seen because they would not give rise to a world like ours .",
    "( the authors of @xcite add some useful cautionary notes concerning the phenomenological import of these ideas . )",
    "while an anthropic explanation of the fundamental parameters of our world is certainly possible , it would be disappointing to many physicists because it suggests a loss of predictability .",
    "in fact , that need not strictly be the case  it could well be that all viable models in the phenomenologically acceptable region of the discretuum share certain relations between their fundamental parameters , and this would be the prediction of the theory . in any case",
    ", it seems premature to resurrect the anthropic principle because , to date , there is not a _ single _ phenomenologically acceptable model of our world derived from string theory !",
    "finding one such model may lead to many others , but even one would at present be a triumph .",
    "it is worth mentioning that _ perturbative _ effects may suffice to stabilize the kahler moduli , or at least to give a metastable minimum , in a non - supersymmetric setting @xcite .",
    "the basic idea here is that expanding the potential for kahler moduli around a point with @xmath168 where the other moduli are stabilized or slowly rolling can modify the no - scale structure of ( [ noscale ] ) .",
    "dynamical effects like coupling to the kinetic energy or fluctuations of other fields can also stabilize moduli , at least for a period of time @xcite .",
    "these are interesting ideas that point to the fact that many simple dynamical avenues for stabilizing moduli have not been adequately explored .",
    "likewise , the more exotic avenues towards de sitter space using ii@xmath83 theories @xcite and non - critical string theory @xcite also deserve exploration .    using all of these techniques",

    "likewise , the authors of @xcite have suggested an interesting model in which the techniques of kklt @xcite give rise to potential with a series of de sitter minima with cosmological constant decreasing as the compactification scale increases .",

    "it would be very interesting to construct a body of rules for engineering moduli potentials with different shapes .",
    "ultimately we wish to realize inflation and/or a positive cosmological constant in a theory with realistic particle physics .",

    "metastable de sitter vacua have been argued to arise in @xcite .",
    "fluxes have also been used to stabilize moduli in semi - realistic d - brane compactifications @xcite . in the latter settting",
