    "association football ( simply referred to as _ football _ in the forthcoming ) is arguably the most popular sport in the world .",
    "traditionally , plenty of attention has been devoted to goals and their distribution as the main focus of football statistics .",
    "however , shots remain a rare occurrence in football games , to a much larger extent than in other team sports .",
    "long possessions and paucity of scoring opportunities are defining features of football games .",
    "passes , on the other hand , are two orders of magnitude more frequent than goals , and therfore constitute a much more appropriate event to look at when trying to describe the elusive quality of ` _ _ playing style _ _ ' .",
    "some studies on passing have been performed , either at the level of passing sequences distributions ( cf @xcite ) , by studying passing networks @xcite , or from a dynamic perspective studying game flow @xcite , or passing _ flow motifs _ at the team level @xcite , where passing flow motifs ( developed following @xcite ) were satisfactorily proven by gyarmati , kwak and rodrguez to set appart passing style from football teams from randomized networks .    in the present work we ellaborate on @xcite by extending the flow motif analysis to a player level .",
    "we start by breaking down all possible 3-passes motifs into all the different variations resulting from labelling a distinguished node in the motif , resulting on a total of 15 different 3-passes motifs at the player level ( stemming from the 5 motifs for teams ) . for each player in our dataset , and each game they partitipate in , we compute the number of instances each pattern occurs .",
    "the resulting 15-dimensional distribution is used as a fingerprint for the player style , which characterizes what type of involvement the player has with his teammates .",
    "the resulting feature vectors are then used in order to provide a notion of similarity between different football players , providing us with a quantifiable measure on how _ close _ the playing styles between any two arbitrary players are .",
    "this is done in two different ways , first by performing a clustering analysis ( with automatic cluster detection ) on the feature vectors , which allow us to identify 37 separate groups of similar players , and secondly by defining a distance function ( based on the mean features z - scores ) which consequently is used to construct the distance similarity score .    as an illustrative example",
    ", we perform a detailed analysis of all the defined quantities for xavi hernndez , captain of fc barcelona who just left the team after many years in which he has been considered the flagship of the famous _ tiki - taka _ style both for his club and for the spanish national team . using our data - based _ style fingerprint _ we try to address the pressing question : which player could possibly replace the best passer in the world ?",
    "the basis of our analysis is the study of passing subsequences .",
    "the passing style of a team is partially encoded , from an static point of view , in the passing network ( cf .",
    "a more dynamical approach is taken in @xcite , where passing subsequences are classified ( at the team level ) through `` flow motifs '' of the passing network .    inspired by the work on flow motifs for teams , we carry out a similar analysis at the player level .",
    "we focus on studying flow motifs corresponding to sequences of three consecutive passes .",
    "passing motifs are not concerned with the names of the players involved on a sequence of passes , but rather on the structure of the sequence itself . from a team s point of view , there are five possible variations : abab , abac , abca , abcb , and abcd ( where each letter represents a different player within the sequence ) .",
    "the situation is different when looking at flow motifs from an specific player s point of view , as that player needs to be singled out within each passing sequence .",
    "allowing for variation of a single player s relative position within a passing sequence , the total numer of motifs increases to fifteen .",
    "these patterns can all be obtained by swapping the position of player a with each of the other players ( and relabelling if necessary ) in each of the five motifs for teams . adopting the convention that our singled - out player is always denoted by letter ` a '",
    ", the resulting motifs can be labelled as follows ( the basic team motif shown in bold letters ) :"
