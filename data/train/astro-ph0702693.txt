    "the mass function of a star cluster changes because of both stellar evolution and stellar dynamics .",
    "stellar evolution causes the turn - off mass to decrease as the most massive stars evolve away from the main sequence , ascend the giant branch to ultimately shed their envelopes to turn into compact objects .",
    "stellar evolution therefore has a characteristic effect on the mass function by truncating it at the high mass end .",
    "the dynamical evolution of a cluster has a more complicated effect on changes in the mass function .",
    "the dominant effect here is dynamical friction , which causes the most massive stars to sink to the cluster centre on a time scale that is inversely proportional to the stellar mass , i.e. the most massive stars tend to sink more quickly than relatively lighter stars . at the same time , stars less massive than the average mass tend to leave the inner regions . as a result of this _",
    "mass segregation _",
    ", the local stellar population becomes a function of the distance to the cluster centre .",
    "mass segregation , though mostly noticeable in the cluster s central regions , is a global phenomenon .",
    "a star cluster that is born with the same mass function across its radial coordinate will gradually grow a top - heavy mass function in its centre and a top - depleted mass function in its outskirts .",
    "near the half mass radius , the mass function remains closest to the initial mass function @xcite .    in this letter , we concentrate on the evolution of the stellar mass function in the inner part of young and dense star clusters , using @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "our interest in this topic was initiated by the recent accurate measurements published by @xcite in which the mass function in the inner @xmath4  from the centre of the arches star cluster was studied .",
    "these observations , especially the latter , revealed that the mass function of near the centre of arches cluster is a broken power law , with the turning point @xmath5 .",
    "we were able to reproduce this feature without invoking any special mechanism .",
    "our simulations allow us to draw conclusions on the history of the dynamical evolution of the arches cluster .",
    "as a cluster evolves , stars more massive than the mean mass tend to sink to the cluster centre whereas lighter stars move outwards . for the most massive stars , the time scale for dynamical friction is proportional to two - body relaxation time , @xmath6 : @xmath7 were @xmath8 is the mass of the massive star , which segregates inwards .",
    "the value of the relaxation time at the cluster s half - mass radius , @xmath9 is given by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  2.63 ) @xmath10 here @xmath11 is newton s constant of gravity , @xmath12 and @xmath0 are the total mass and the number of stars in the cluster and @xmath13 is the coulomb logarithm , for which we adopt @xmath14 @xcite . for the central relaxation time , we use @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the three - dimensional velocity dispersion , number density and average stellar mass at the cluster centre ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  3.37 ) .",
    "we follow the dynamical evolution of our models by means of direct @xmath0-body simulations , which we carry out with the starlab software environment @xcite .",
    "the calculations are performed on the grape-6 special purpose computer @xcite .",
    "our numerical experiments are performed with @xmath19 and 24576 stars . for each @xmath0",
    ", we perform simulations starting with a full range of density profiles for which we chose @xcite models with the dimensionless parameter @xmath20 ranging from 3 to 12 .",
    "the mass function in our simulations is described by a power - law , @xmath21 , where we adopt the salpeter value for the index ( @xmath22 ) , with masses ranging from 1@xmath1 to 100@xmath1 . to validate our results",
    ", we carried out additional simulations with @xmath23 as well as with a salpeter mass function with 0.1@xmath1 as the lower limit .",
    "it will turn out that the presence of a tidal field has little effect on the results , but reducing the lower limit to the initial mass function to 0.1@xmath1 has a profound effect on the results , as we discuss below .",
    "for clarity we mainly focus on the models with 12288 and 24576 stars . with these parameters ,",
    "the relaxation time at the virial radius for the 12kmodels is about 360 @xmath0-body time units , whereas for the 24k models this is 625 @xmath0-body time units ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the close proximity of the arches cluster to the galactic centre @xcite would seemingly require the simulations to include tidal effects . and for understanding the dynamics in the cluster outskirts or the evaporation time scale the tidal field will prove crucial . for studying the evolution of the central region on the short time scale reported here , however , the tidal field has negligible effect .",
    "we support this statement by carrying out additional simulations which include the tidal field , and those show no discernible effect .",
    "we therefore focus on the results of simulations without a tidal field .",
    "this has the attractive side effect that it allows us to scale our results with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "we also ignore the effects of stellar evolution .",
    "this approximation is rectified as on the short lifetime of the cluster ( @xmath24myr ) even the most massive stars remain on the main sequence , though some effect of the stellar mass loss at the top end of the mass function can be expected . for example , a 60@xmath1 zero - age main sequence star with solar metalicity loses about 3@xmath1 in its first @xmath25myr , which has a negligible effect on the slope of the mass function .      in our simulations",
    "we identify the moment of core collapse as soon as a persistent binary forms with a binding energy of at least 100kt ( where the energy scale kt is defined by the condition that the total stellar kinetic energy of the system , excluding internal binary motion , is @xmath26kt ) . for a cluster with a mass function that is consistent with the observed mass function in young star clusters ,",
    "core collapse occurs at a more or less constant fraction of the initial central relaxation time @xmath27 @xcite . in fig.[fig : tcc ] we plot the moment of core collapse as a function of the initial concentration of the cluster .",
    "the slight dependence of @xmath28 on @xmath29 , as well as the offset between our results with those of @xcite is presumably mainly caused by their broader range of stellar masses ( @xmath30 ) in the initial mass function , whereas here we adopt an initial mass function with @xmath31 .",
    "an additional effect is expected from the difference in the number of stars .",
    "the simulations of @xcite were carried out with @xmath32 .",
    "the systematic difference between our results from simulations with 12k and 24k stars shows that this also affects the results systematically . at this moment , however , we can not quantify this effect .",
    "dynamical friction causes the massive stars to segregate to the cluster centre making the mass function flatter at the higher end , in this region , until the formation of a hard binary . in figure[fig : mfvstime ] we illustrate the evolution of the mass function between and 2 .",
    "we show the mass function at birth ( top curve , the salpeter mass function ) , halfway to core collapse and at core collapse ( bottom curve ) .",
    "we denote the point around which the slope of the mass function changes by , and the power - law indices in higher and lower ends by @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively . the apparent decrease in the number of stars in the mass function presented in figure[fig : mfvstime ] is the result of the cluster becoming more concentrated which causes the adopted annulus ( @xmath35 ) to become narrower .",
    "the effect of flattening of the mass function is less pronounced further away from the cluster centre .",
    "this is illustrated in figure[fig : xhm ] , where we present the evolution of @xmath36 for the 24k simulations with @xmath37 and for @xmath38 to ( top curve ) , for @xmath39 to 2 and for @xmath40 to 3 ( bottom curve ) .",
    "the values of @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath34 are obtained by a three - point least squares fit to the mass function in a predetermined annulus of the simulated date .",
    "note that we relaxed the fitting procedure in the sense that the mass function is not required to be continuous .",
    "the point of stalling of the evolution of the mass function can be identified by the moment of core collapse , regardless of the initial concentration or the number of stars in the simulation .",
    "therefore , we normalize the time axis in figure[fig : xhm ] to that instant .      after the formation of a hard binary , the mass function achieves a quasi steady state .",
    "the slope of the high - mass end of the mass function varies throughout the cluster . in in figure[fig : xmgtmp ] we show how the mass function for stars with @xmath43 after the moment of core collapse is a function of the distance to the cluster centre , being flatter closer in and resembling the initial mass function further out .",
    "overplotted are the observed values of the mass function exponent ( see tab.[tab : arches ] , see  [ sect : arches ] ) .",
    "the results of our simulations with a tidal field are statistically identical to those with a tidal field .",
    "the simulations with a minimum mass to the initial mass function of @xmath44 is plotted as the thin dashed curve in fig.[fig : xmgtmp ] . for clarity we did",
    "not plot error bars for this figure , but the results with a lower limit of 0.1@xmath1 are inconsistent with the observed values .    in figure[fig :",
    "mp_vs_r ] , we show the value of as a function of distance from the cluster centre for various simulations , past the moment of core collapse .",
    "it turns out that more concentrated initial models tend to result in a slightly smaller value of whereas simulations with a smaller number of stars give rise to a higher value of .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath34 is rather insensitive to the initial concentration of the cluster .",
    "it may be noted that the results of simulations with 0.1@xmath1as the lower limit of the mass function are not consistent with the observed values of @xmath34 and @xmath45 .",
    "[ sect : comparison ]    at a projected distance of about 25pc from sgr a * , the arches cluster ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 in j2000 ) , discovered by @xcite , is peculiar .",
    "the total cluster mass is about @xmath48@xmath1 .",
    "the core radius of the cluster ( defined as the radial distance from the cluster centre where the luminosity profile drops by a factor two ) is = 5.0 @xcite , and corresponds to about 0.2pc if we assume that the distance to the galactic centre is 8kpc .",
    "the age of the cluster is @xmath49myr @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite observed the arches cluster using keck / nirc2 laser guide star adaptive optics .",
    "their observations covered the inner parts of the cluster and some control fields at a distance of about 2.4pc ( 60  ) from the cluster centre .",
    "they subsequently constructed the luminosity and mass functions down to about 1.3@xmath1 , in an annulus of 5  ( about 1.0 ) to 9  ( about 1.8 ) from the cluster centre . in table[tab : arches ] we give the various measurements of the mass function and the distance from the cluster centre in terms of the observed core radius .    .",
    "parameters for the observed mass function of the arches cluster .",
    "the first two columns give the range over which the mass function is measured , in units of the cluster s core radius ( @xmath50pc ) .",
    "the third and fourth columns give the range in masses for which the exponent of the mass function ( last column ) is fitted .",
    "column 5 gives the reference for the mass function exponents 1 : @xcite , 2 : @xcite , 3 : @xcite , and the last column the measured value of @xmath51 between @xmath52 and @xmath53 . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,^ \" , ]     the data show that the slope in the mass function for stars more massive than @xmath54@xmath1 flattens towards the cluster centre ( see fig.[fig : xmgtmp ] ) .",
    "for lower mass stars , as well as for further out than @xmath55 it is closer to to the salpeter mass function .",
    "the observed mass function in the arches is not a simple power - law @xcite .",
    "we argue that in the inner parts of the cluster , @xmath56 , the mass function is best described by two power laws with the break around @xmath576@xmath1 .",
    "the mass function below this break ( @xmath45 ) resembles the initial mass function ( @xmath58 ) , and above @xmath45 it becomes flatter ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "further out than @xmath60 the break disappears and the mass function becomes gradually better represented with the initial mass function .",
    "we performed detailed simulations of the evolution of young and dense star clusters using direct @xmath0-body simulations , in order to constrain the observed mass function within about one parsec from the centre of the arches cluster .",
    "the initial conditions of our simulations range over the full spectrum of king model density profiles .",
    "the mass function in the central region of the arches cluster is peculiar as it appears to be split in two power - laws , one for the stars less massive than 56@xmath1 and a much shallower slope for the more massive stars .",
    "the two power - laws fit the observed data between 5  and 9  is marginally better ( @xmath61 ) than a single power - law ( @xmath62 ) .    the simulations we perform to mimic the arches cluster are able to reproduce this observed broken power - law mass function at the observed projected distance from the cluster centre ( @xmath384 ) .",
    "the best comparison between observations and simulations is obtained if the cluster is about half way core collapse ( @xmath630.6 ) .",
    "our simulations , however , are performed without stellar evolution and without including the effects of an external tidal potential . as a result , they are scale - free , and no specific choices for the scalings to mass , size and therefore to time are obliged .",
    "however , the scale - free aspect of our simulations hinders the direct comparison to some extend as the size scale ( in parsec ) and time scale ( in myr ) are important for an unbiased comparison with the observed arches cluster .    in the comparison with the observations we adopt the same definition of the core radius by projecting the cluster and assigning luminosities of all stars in our simulations using zero - age main - sequence luminosities .",
    "we ignore here the fact that very massive stars may become brighter in the @xmath64myr lifetime of the cluster , but this only affects the most massive stars , whereas the measurements are dominated by stars in the mid - range of masses .",
    "the arches cluster does not show any evidence for primordial mass segregation as our simulations ( which were initialized without primordial mass segregation ) are able to satisfactorily reproduce the observed mass function over the entire range of observed masses and distances from the cluster centre .",
    "note also that the presence of primordial gas which failed to form stars does not seem to have affected the early cluster evolution , as the observed cluster structure at an age of @xmath64myr is satisfactory explained with the simulations , which do not include gas dynamics .",
    "the initial mass function of the arches cluster is then consistent with a salpeter slope between 1@xmath1 and 100@xmath1 without the need for a radial dependence .",
    "there seems to be no need for a large population of stars less massive than @xmath2@xmath1 .    in fig.[fig : xmgtmp ] we show the evolution of @xmath34 for the annuli and distances from the cluster centre reported from our compilation from the literature in tab.[tab : arches ] .",
    "the best match between the simulations and the observations is acquired for simulations between @xmath65 and 0.6 , i.e : we predict that the cluster is about half way towards core collapse .",
    "we therefore conclude that the arches cluster has not yet experienced core collapse but is currently in a pre collapse stage .    in tab.[tab : arches ] we have quantified the slope to the low mass end of the mass function in 5  to 9  annulus of the arches cluster as consistent with salpeter , whereas the naive measurement in fig.5 of @xcite would results in @xmath66 ( with @xmath57@xmath1 ) , which is unusually steep . if this slope would represent the intrinsic arches initial mass function and we adopt a minimum mass of 1@xmath1 the observed @xmath67 stars more massive than @xmath54@xmath1 in the arches cluster would result in a total number of more than @xmath68 stars , which is unrealistically high . from an observational point of view",
    "there are good arguments that the low mass end of the mass function is over - estimated , as it is plagued by selection effects .",
    "one of these effects is the artificial correction of missing stars in a crowded field and the selection of the three control fields to compensate for the background population . in the keck observations these control fields are within about 2.4pc from the cluster centre , which corresponds to @xmath69 .",
    "for a king model with @xmath70 the control fields would then be located near the cluster tidal radius . and",
    "since the cluster is about half way towards core collapse it is conceivable that the density profile is described with a king model with @xmath71 , in which case the control field are part of the cluster halo .",
    "due to mass segregation the cluster outskirts will be depleted of high mass stars and low mass stars will be overrepresented ( the opposite effect as we discussed for the core population ) . correcting the mass function in the cluster core with a population taken from near the cluster halo will therefore result in an enormous over correction towards the low mass stars , and consequentially result in a steepening of the corrected mass function .",
    "one of the control fields ( field b of kim et al , 2006 ) is taken near the location where one expects the tidal tail of the cluster in the potential of the galaxy to pass though .",
    "the tidal tail is , since it consists of the halo population , also likely to be dominated by low mass stars .",
    "each of the effects discussed tend to steepen the lower - mass end of the mass function , though it is not trivial to quantize the effect without a much more detailed study .",
    "we however , argue that the initial mass function of the arches cluster was probably consistent with salpeter over the observed mass range .",
    "the observed break in the mass function around 56@xmath1 and the consequential flattening of the mass function for higher masses is then the result of the dynamical evolution of the cluster .",
    "the initial model which is most comparable to the observed arches cluster has a salpeter initial mass function between 1@xmath1 and 100@xmath1 and with a reasonably concentrated initial density profile ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) .",
    "the break in the mass function in the inner parts of the cluster ( for @xmath74 ) appear at @xmath75 , which for our simulations is at about 5@xmath1 .",
    "the break in the observed mass function in the arches cluster appears around the same mass of @xmath766@xmath1 .",
    "we performed additional simulations with @xmath77 using a salpeter mass function down to 0.1@xmath1 , and in this case the break in the core mass function also developed around @xmath75 , which for the adopted mass function is about 1.0@xmath1(figure[fig : mp_vs_r ] ) .",
    "based on these findings we argue that the initial mass function in the arches cluster has a lower limit of about 1.0@xmath1 , as in our simulations that reproduce the observations best .    we predict that other clusters with similar parameters as the arches cluster , like westerlund 1 , ngc 3603 @xcite , r136 @xcite and quintuplet @xcite will show similar characteristics as arches",
    ". the mass functions in their cores will also be rather flat for stars more massive than 56@xmath1 . and the mass functions further away from the cluster centre will gradually be more like the initial mass function .",
