    "the observation of an excitation gap above @xmath7 ( called the `` pseudogap '' ) in the underdoped cuprate superconductors has been the focus of much current research .",
    "presumably an understanding of this state will help unravel the formal machinery , if not the attractive pairing mechanism behind high temperature superconductivity .",
    "it is now widely believed that this state is associated with the underlying superconducting phase , in large part because the ( @xmath8-wave ) symmetry of the pseudogap is found @xcite to be the same as that of the excitation gap and order parameter in the @xmath9 state . among viable candidates for the origin of the pseudogap state",
    "are phase fluctuation scenarios@xcite , @xmath8-wave nodal excitation mechanisms @xcite and a bcs bose - einstein `` crossover picture '' @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to discuss the last of these , the crossover scenario within the superconducting state .",
    "our work is directed towards the fundamental issues of the crossover problem , with lesser emphasis on the physics of the cuprates .",
    "we present a generalized overview based on a finite temperature t matrix formulation .",
    "our aim is to provide a useful understanding and to extend the physics of the well characterized ground state@xcite . in the process",
    "we establish a clear distinction between incoherent , finite center of mass momentum , pair excitations and order parameter fluctuations ( i.e. , collective modes ) , and their respective dynamics .",
    "we formulate a gauge invariant description of the electrodynamic response with an emphasis on particle - hole asymmetry which is necessarily very important .",
    "although we introduce a generalized t matrix approach , special attention will be paid to one particular version which has been extensively discussed in our previous work @xcite .    in the bcs bose - einstein condensation ( bec )",
    "crossover approach , it is presumed that there is a smooth evolution , with increasing attractive coupling constant @xmath1 , from bcs superconductivity , in which strongly overlapping cooper pairs form and bose condense at precisely the same temperature @xmath7 , to a quasi - ideal bose gas state ( to be characterized in more detail below ) in which tightly bound fermion pairs ( composite bosons ) form at temperatures much higher than their bose condensation temperature @xmath7 . in this latter case",
    "there is an excitation gap ( pseudogap ) for _ fermionic _ excitations well above @xmath7 .",
    "these ideas date back to the late sixties when eagles@xcite first drew attention to the possibility of smoothly interpolating between the bcs and bose - einstein ground state descriptions of superconductivity .",
    "this was followed by a well known paper by leggett@xcite who presented an interpolation scheme for the ground state based on a variational wave - function , in which the chemical potential @xmath10 was self consistently varied ( with increasing @xmath1 ) from @xmath11 to large negative values .",
    "nozieres and schmitt - rink@xcite , hereafter referred to as nsr , generalized these previous approaches by presenting a crossover theory for computing @xmath7 .",
    "although this leading order theory was not fully self consistent@xcite , nevertheless , much of the essential physics pertaining to finite @xmath0 was summarized in ref .  .    with the discovery of the short coherence length cuprates , several groups noted the relevance of this body of theoretical work .",
    "indeed , this recognition was made well in advance of a community - wide appreciation of pseudogap phenomena , which phenomena have only served to re - enforce interest in these crossover schemes .",
    "randeria and co - workers@xcite were among the first to apply the nsr approach to the cuprates .",
    "_ et al__@xcite presented detailed studies of the attractive hubbard model with varying on - site coulomb interaction @xmath12 , and uemura @xcite noted , on the basis of unusual correlations deduced from @xmath10sr experiments , that the cuprates exhibited aspects of bosonic character , as might be expected in a crossover theory .",
    "our own group@xcite has also addressed cuprate issues in the past year using the formalism of the present paper .",
    "attempts to go beyond the nsr scheme at finite @xmath0 are relatively more recent and almost exclusively restricted to two dimensional systems .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite on the attractive hubbard model , along with numerical @xcite and analytical @xcite studies of the so - called flex scheme @xcite have provided some insights .",
    "this diagrammatic flex approach should be contrasted with an alternative ( called the  pairing approximation \" ) which we @xcite have introduced into the literature and which is based on earlier work by kadanoff and martin@xcite , and extended by patton@xcite . in contrast to the flex scheme this latter approach precisely yields bcs theory in the small @xmath1 limit . what is more important in distinguishing our work from that of others",
    ", however , is our direct focus@xcite on _ crossover effects within the superconducting state_. this is the topic of the present paper , as well , and necessarily requires studies of systems in higher than two dimensions , where @xmath7 is non - zero . the ultimately decisive factor in determining whether these crossover theories or any other alternatives are appropriate for the cuprates , may well come from the predicted behavior below @xmath7",
    "this fact has also been emphasized by deutscher @xcite .",
    "all crossover theories are based on an underlying `` generic '' hamiltonian describing the attractive interaction between fermions with opposite spin orientation ( for spin singlet pairing )    @xmath14    where @xmath15 creates a particle in the momentum state @xmath16 with spin @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the energy dispersion measured from the chemical potential @xmath10 ( we take @xmath19 ) . for the jellium case @xmath20 , while for the lattice case we consider an anisotropic tight - binding model with @xmath21 , where @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) is the hopping integral for the in - plane ( out - of - plane ) motion , and we set the lattice constant @xmath24 . here",
    "we assume a separable pairing interaction @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the coupling strength and the momentum dependence of the function @xmath27 , reflects the pairing anisotropy , and its form depends on the particular model under consideration .",
    "for the jellium case we take@xcite @xmath28 , where @xmath29 gives the range of the interaction and represents a soft cutoff in momentum space for the pairing interaction . in the lattice case ,",
    "@xmath30 for @xmath31-wave pairing symmetry , and @xmath32 for @xmath8-wave symmetry . to simplify the notation , until sec .",
    "v , when the effects of @xmath27 become relevant , we choose to write our equations with @xmath33 .",
    "it is important to stress the key assumptions of these crossover theories : ( i ) only two body fermionic interactions are included .",
    "( ii ) in calculations of _ equilibrium _ properties ( as distinct from studies of the collective mode of the superconducting order parameter ) , repulsive coulomb interactions between fermions are absorbed into the effective pairing interaction @xmath34 .",
    "these coulomb effects are presumed to be weak enough so that the attractive interactions driving superconductivity dominate , and it is assumed that coulomb interactions do _ not _ occur between fermion pairs or composite bosons .    using this hamiltonian , leggett@xcite found that the bcs ground state wavefunction @xmath35 is appropriate to _ both _ the weakly and strongly interacting limits , provided @xmath36 , where @xmath37 .",
    "moreover , the explicit parameter @xmath38 and the implicit parameter @xmath10 follow from the following two self consistent conditions    @xmath39    and    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the electron number density .    in the weak coupling limit ,",
    "the above equations yield the usual bcs state .",
    "by contrast , in the strong coupling ( i.e. , @xmath42 ) limit , for the case of jellium , the system corresponds to a bose condensation of nonoverlapping and _ non - interacting _ tightly bound pairs of fermions , which resemble to diatomic molecules .",
    "this is an `` essentially ideal bose gas''@xcite .",
    "indeed , it can be shown@xcite that in the strong coupling limit , eq .  ( 3 ) can be recast in the form of the schredinger equation , written in momentum space , for an _ isolated _ diatomic molecule , consisting of the two fermions .",
    "the strong coupling limit was argued to be slightly more complicated for a lattice of fermions@xcite which , at moderate densities , is to be distinguished from jellium . here",
    "a canonical transformation can be used to partially integrate out the fermions and the pauli principle then leads to hard core repulsions between composite bosons .",
    "nevertheless , even for a lattice , this scheme is viewed as reasonable@xcite so that the bcs wave function assumption , or equivalently eqs .",
    "( [ thouless - crit ] ) and ( [ number ] ) , represent an effective mean field approximation to the solution of the hard core composite boson problem .",
    "this essentially ideal bose gas treatment of the ground state in the strong coupling limit is to be contrasted with the behavior found in the collective mode spectrum , where calculations lead to results similar to those for a weakly interacting bose gas .",
    "these calculations suggest the presence of an _ effective _ boson - boson interaction in this limit .    within crossover theories , the @xmath13 behavior of the anderson bogoliubov ( ab ) mode has been studied in refs .  , and .",
    "in the long wavelength ( small @xmath43 ) limit the dispersion relation of the sound - like ab mode is linear : @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the ab mode velocity . in weak coupling",
    ", the usual bcs limit is obtained for the ab mode velocity @xmath46 . in strong coupling ,",
    "@xmath45 reflects an effective boson - boson interaction @xcite which arises from the pauli principle .",
    "we caution that even though the phrase boson - boson interaction is frequently used here and in the literature , in the composite boson system ( within the crossover scenario ) , these interactions should always be viewed as indirect and associated with the underlying fermionic interactions .    in summary ,",
    "the @xmath13 description of the composite boson problem ( in the strong coupling limit ) represents a cross between ideal and non - ideal bose - einstein physics . whereas , an incomplete condensation at zero temperature is required in order to obtain superfluidity in a  true \" bose system@xcite , in the crossover scenario , the condensation is always complete ( at @xmath13 ) , but , nevertheless the phase mode and superconductivity exist .      in this section",
    "we discuss our general results and physical picture for the finite @xmath0 crossover problem , at an intuitive level .",
    "these results are then re - derived in more detail in sec .",
    "iii using a microscopic t - matrix approach . as the temperature is increased above @xmath13 , and the coupling @xmath1 becomes sufficiently strong , two important effects ensue @xcite .",
    "( i ) the excitation gap is no longer the same as ( the amplitude of ) the superconducting order parameter .",
    "( ii ) incoherent pair excitations with non - zero center of mass momentum can be thermally excited .",
    "indeed , points ( i ) and ( ii ) are inter - related .",
    "the first of these is anticipated as one leaves the bcs regime , where even above @xmath7 , there is expected to be a normal state gap for fermionic excitations ; this gap is associated with meta - stable ( intermediate @xmath1 ) @xcite or stable ( large @xmath1 ) pairs .",
    "it is natural to presume , as we have found,@xcite that these effects persist below @xmath7 . indeed ,",
    "if there is an excitation gap at @xmath7 , in any second order superconducting transition , this gap must necessarily be different from the superconducting order parameter , at least , at and slightly below @xmath7 .",
    "the second of these two points was noted in ref .  .",
    "these pair excitations are related to the  particle \" excitation branch of the interacting bose system , which ( although similar to collective phase mode branch at small wave - vectors ) , represents a distinct dynamical mode@xcite . in the composite boson problem the pair excitations and related pair propagator , called @xmath48 ,",
    "play an essential role . in the limit of non - zero @xmath49",
    ", we refer to this propagator as @xmath50 , where the subscript @xmath51 derives from `` pseudogap '' . for small @xmath52 and @xmath53 ,",
    "it may be approximated by    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the usual renormalization factor , @xmath56 is a bosonic matsubara frequency , @xmath57 is the dispersion of the finite momentum pair excitations ( with @xmath58 ) , @xmath59 is the pair excitation lifetime , and @xmath60 is the associated effective pair `` chemical potential '' with its value set by the well known ( ideal gas ) bec condition    @xmath61    it is this function @xmath62 , which will be shown in sec .",
    "iii , to determine the _ fermionic _ excitation gap @xmath63 and chemical potential @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , the fermionic excitation gap is related , in turn , to the condition that @xmath64 at and below @xmath7 . quite generally , the presence of incoherent pair excitations blocks the available states for fermions and , thereby , affects the fermion excitation gap .",
    "these effects , which occur both above and below @xmath7 , are directly related to particle - hole asymmetry which appears as the system crosses out of the bcs regime .",
    "it should be stressed that within the bcs - bec crossover picture , the form of @xmath65 is highly circumscribed so as to produce the ground state equations , eqs .",
    "( [ thouless - crit ] ) and ( [ number ] ) . through these equations",
    "the fermionic degrees of freedom play an important role , even at very strong coupling .",
    "this constraint can then be used to deduce the function @xmath66 .",
    "we find that the pairing approximation ( discussed in sec .",
    "iii below ) produces this @xmath13 description of the fermionic degrees of freedom , and that , as a consequence , for sufficiently small @xmath67 , the pair excitation dispersion is given by    @xmath68    where the pair mass @xmath69 is dependent on @xmath1 , temperature , density , lattice structure and other materials properties .",
    "this dispersion is found to be a consequence of other t - matrix schemes , as well , and takes a similar form above @xmath7 , although there the pairs are not as long lived .",
    "once the pair propagator is characterized , @xmath7 can be obtained either when approached from above or below .",
    "we may now quantify the first point ( i ) listed above .",
    "the deviation between the excitation gap and the order parameter is related to the number of thermally excited finite momentum pair excitations .",
    "we define the difference between the excitation gap @xmath38 and order parameter @xmath70 as    @xmath71    where throughout this paper , @xmath70 is taken to be real .",
    "the number of ( incoherent ) pair excitations is given in terms of the pair propagator @xmath72    @xmath73    where @xmath74 is the bose function and @xmath75 is the analytically continued ( @xmath76 ) pair propagator . in the regime of intermediate coupling , where pseudogap effects are apparent , these bosonic excitations act in concert with fermionic excitations@xcite .",
    "this is what one expects if there is to be a smooth interpolation between the bcs and bec limits .    the behavior of @xmath6 , @xmath38 and @xmath70 is schematically plotted in fig .  1 in the three different regimes : weak ( bcs ) , intermediate , and strong coupling ( nearly bec ) regimes",
    "below @xmath7 these plots are based on detailed numerical calculations@xcite , whereas above @xmath7 , where the computations are more difficult@xcite , on a simple extrapolation procedure.@xcite    it may be noted that fig .",
    "1 has a direct analogue in the ( coulomb modulated ) phase fluctuation scenario@xcite .",
    "the three panels ( from top to bottom ) would then correspond to progressively decreasing the size of the plasma frequency @xmath77 . in this phase fluctuation scenario",
    "the tuning parameter is @xmath77 , whereas in the crossover scenario the parameter @xmath1 sets the scale for the size of @xmath3 .",
    "it should , thus , be clear that coulomb - modulated phase fluctuations are not the only way to create an excitation gap which appears above the transition temperature .",
    "it should , finally , be stressed that these incoherent , finite momentum pair excitations , which enter into @xmath6 via eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) , are irrelevant in the bcs limit , in accord with eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) and fig .",
    "in that limit the `` quasi - particle '' assumption implicit in eq .  ( [ eq:4a ] ) is invalid and because of both the lack of particle - hole asymmetry and the large damping @xmath78 , the pair excitation spectrum overlaps the particle - particle continuum .",
    "one can quantify the reliability of this key approximation . in fig .",
    "2 , using our numerical scheme@xcite , we plot the value @xmath79 of the wave - vector @xmath80 at which the pair dispersion intersects the continuum states , as a function of coupling @xmath1 .",
    "this corresponds to a measure of the landau damping of the pair propagator .",
    "the shaded region indicates where the incoherent finite momentum pairs represent ill - defined excitations . outside this shaded region ,",
    "the assumptions implicit in eq .",
    "( [ eq:4a ] ) should be valid .",
    "related calculations show that @xmath81 is arbitrarily small in the weak coupling limit , so that even if we apply eq .",
    "( [ eq:4a ] ) directly in this limit , pseudogap effects are negligible in the bcs regime",
    ".      a first important distinction can be found , between true and composite bosons , at the level of the leggett ground state . as noted earlier , already at @xmath13",
    "there appears to be a mix of quasi - ideal and interacting bose gas character to the strong coupling limit . the gap equation [ eq .  ( [ thouless - crit ] ) ]",
    "is associated @xcite with  noninteracting diatomic molecules \" , whereas , the collective mode spectrum @xcite reflects an effective boson - boson interaction which relates to the pauli statistics of the constituent fermions .",
    "this is revealed most clearly in jellium models where the ab sound velocity remains finite at infinite @xmath1 , with an asymptote associated with the residual interactions . some insight into the origin of these boson - boson effects",
    "can be found in refs .   and .",
    "indeed , one should be cautious in the use of the phrase effective boson - boson repulsion which , for large @xmath1 , derives entirely from fermi statistical effects . unlike in the interacting bose system@xcite ,",
    "where boson - boson interactions need to be separately included in the boson propagator , here the physics associated with the pauli principle is already accounted for and should not be fed back again to renormalize the dispersion of the composite bosons .",
    "a second important difference arises from the fact that this superconducting ground state corresponds to one in which there is full condensation so that , as in the bcs phase , the condensate fraction @xmath82 .",
    "by contrast , in a bose superfluid there is always a depletion of the condensate at @xmath13 , caused by the existence of the boson - boson repulsion .    as a final important difference , we note that the behavior of the pair propagator @xmath65 , which must necessarily be consistent with eqs .",
    "( [ thouless - crit ] ) and ( [ number ] ) , is highly circumscribed and rather different from what one might deduce based on the bogoliubov model for a bose liquid@xcite .",
    "the fermionic degrees of freedom can never be fully `` integrated out '' .",
    "the fermionic excitation gap @xmath38 and the pair chemical potential @xmath83 are , moreover , closely inter - related via , e.g. , eq .",
    "( [ eq : t4 ] ) below .",
    "these effects have no natural counterpart in the bose liquid ( where the fermionic excitation gap is of no consequence ) .",
    "it is , thus , not surprising that in @xmath7 calculations , which are associated with a divergence in @xmath84 , a variety of different groups @xcite find that the strong coupling limit is characterized by a quasi - ideal bec result    @xmath85    where @xmath86 is the same pair mass as that which appears in @xmath87 of eq .",
    "( [ eq:4c ] ) .",
    "thus , from the perspective of @xmath7 and of the _ temperature dependent _ gap equations , _ the bosons are `` free '' _ , except for the renormalized mass .",
    "related theories have reached rather similar conclusions .",
    "@xcite these conclusions owe their origin to the underlying mean field structure of bcs theory , which is the starting point of the crossover scenario . at a more microscopic level , they appear to be associated with general t - matrix approaches , as is discussed below .",
    "in this section we present the self consistency conditions and related gap equations associated with the superconducting state within the broad class of t - matrix - based crossover theories .",
    "an important goal of this discussion is to show that eqs .",
    "( [ eq:4a])-([eq:4 ] ) are rather general consequences of these schemes when applied below @xmath7 . in these non - perturbative",

    "the choice of the functions @xmath94 and pair susceptibility @xmath95 varies from one approximation to another . here",
    "we address two different schemes which introduce self consistency at a level beyond the lowest order t - matrix approximation used by nsr,@xcite so that our discussion focuses on t - matrix schemes where dressed green s functions enter into the self consistency requirements .",

    "by contrast , above @xmath7 there is considerable literature on the behavior of @xmath65 and @xmath7 , which , in the flex scheme , have been calculated numerically @xcite and analytically @xcite by solution of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : t1 ] ) . as the temperature is lowered , this t - matrix develops a maximum around @xmath106 and the transition temperature @xmath7 to the broken symmetry phase is signaled by a pole given by the condition @xmath107 the counterpart of this analysis is considerably more complicated below @xmath7 .",
    "the procedure , which we summarize in this section , is an approximation which is chosen to satisfy the following four criteria : ( i ) it leads to the same transition temperature when approached from below as from above .",
    "( ii ) it leads directly to a _ physical _ interpretation of the bcs - bec crossover scheme as discussed in the previous section and illustrated in fig .  1 .",

    "is that the particle - particle dominates the particle - hole channel .",

    "it is not clear why these boson - boson interactions should then be included yet a second time .",
    "secondly , once there is a renormalization of @xmath227 , this will change the ground state gap equation and corresponding constraint on the fermionic chemical potential @xmath10 , associated with the changed fermionic self energy @xmath123 . moreover",
    ", this renormalization will , presumably , introduce an unphysical incomplete condensation in the ground state , like its counterpart in the bose liquid . in summary ,",
    "the composite boson system is considerably different from the true boson system , because the underlying fermionic constraints ( through @xmath38 , @xmath10 ) can never be ignored .    _ what about coulomb renormalizations of the pair propagator ?",
    "_    if coulomb interactions were included , it would follow , if the analogy were appropriate , that the pair fluctuation mode would then be gapped .",
    "this would again compromise the self consistent conditions which must be satisfied from the fermionic perspective ( i.e. , @xmath38 and @xmath10 ) in the leggett ground state .",
    "indeed , within the bcs formalism ( as well as in the leggett ground state ) long range coulomb interactions do not enter in an important way to change the gap equation structure , but rather they principally affect the collective modes .",
    "it is for this reason that we argued earlier that coulomb effects are presumed to be already included in the pairing interaction .",
    "it should be recalled that at large @xmath1 , we have seen that essentially all signs of the two body ( @xmath1 dependent ) fermion - fermion interaction are absent in the effective boson - boson interaction .",
    "_ does this paper in any way change the way we think about bcs theory ? _ absolutely not .",
    "bcs theory appears as a special case in the weak coupling @xmath1 , particle - hole symmetric limit of our more general approach .",
    "when we study pair excitations in this limit , we find they are greatly damped at all wavevectors @xmath295 , and it makes no sense to talk about them . in this way @xmath296 is vanishingly small in the bcs limit .",
    "_ to what extent are the results of this paper limited by the t matrix approximation ? _ the t - matrix approximation seems to be intimately connected to the physics of the crossover scenario .",
    "this scheme represents , in some sense , a truncation of the interactions at a pair - wise level .",
    "this truncation , which appears to generate a quasi - ideal bose gas character to the composite boson system , mirrors the behavior of the well established ground state .",
    "this approach might not be suitable for other composite boson scenarios , which do not evolve directly from the bcs phase .",
    "nevertheless , these crossover schemes provide a useful way of learning about composite boson systems in general .",
    "moreover , they provide valuable insights about how to extend bcs theory slightly , without abandoning it altogether , and in this way to address a large class of short coherence length , but otherwise conventional , superconductors .",
