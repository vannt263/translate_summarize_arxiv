    "many quantum algorithms may be modelled as a quantum process occurring on a graph . in @xcite",
    ", childs shows that any quantum computation can be encoded as a quantum walk in some graph and thus quantum walks can be regarded as a quantum computation primitive .",
    "we model a network of @xmath6 interacting qubits by a simple graph @xmath7 on @xmath6 vertices , where vertices correspond to qubits and edges to interactions .",
    "the interactions are defined by a time - independent hamiltonian ; that is , a symmetric matrix that acts on the hilbert space of dimension @xmath8 . in this paper , we are concerned with the @xmath9-hamiltonian , whose action on the @xmath10-excitation subspaces is equivalent to the action of the @xmath11-symmetric adjacency matrix of @xmath7 on @xmath12 .",
    "assume all qubits are initialized at the state @xmath13 , except for the qubit corresponding to vertex @xmath3 , which is initialized at state @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath15 be the adjacency matrix of @xmath7 . according to the schrdinger equation",
    ", @xmath16 indicates the probability that the state @xmath17 is measured at @xmath18 after time @xmath1 .",
    "whenever there is a time @xmath1 such that this probability is equal to @xmath10 , we say that there is _ perfect state transfer _ between @xmath3 and @xmath18 .",
    "perfect state transfer has been studied in many families of graphs , including circulants @xcite , cubelike graphs @xcite and distance regular graphs @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for a survey of recent results .    for paths ( or linear chains ) with @xmath6 vertices , perfect state transfer occurs if and only if @xmath6 is @xmath19 or @xmath20 . in general ,",
    "perfect state transfer is understood to be a rare phenomenon , which motivates the definition of _ pretty good state transfer _ ( or _ almost state transfer _ ) , which is said to occur if , for any @xmath21 , there is a time @xmath1 such that @xmath22 pretty good state transfer was first studied for paths in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "proofs and methods in this area are a mix of interesting applications of number theory and algebraic graph theory .",
    "pretty good state transfer between the end vertices in paths with @xmath6 elements occurs if and only if @xmath23 is prime , twice a prime or a power of @xmath19 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , in these cases , it occurs between any pair of vertices equally distant from the centre of the path .",
    "in contrast , the question of whether pretty good state transfer is possible between internal vertices in paths when it does not occur between the end vertices gives rise to a more interesting story and does not appear to have a simple answer .",
    "this question was raised in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we exhibit an infinite family of paths that admit pretty good state transfer between inner vertices but not between the two end vertices .",
    "these paths have @xmath24 vertices where @xmath0 is an odd prime and @xmath25 .",
    "we will make use of the following definitions and preliminary results .",
    "given a symmetric matrix @xmath26 with @xmath27 distinct eigenvalues @xmath28 , we may write the spectral decomposition of @xmath26 as follows : @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the idempotent projection onto the eigenspace corresponding to @xmath31 .",
    "note that @xmath32 .    given a vertex @xmath33 ,",
    "let @xmath34 denote the @xmath11-vector that is @xmath10 at the entry corresponding to @xmath3 , and @xmath35 elsewhere .",
    "we define the _ eigenvalue support _ of @xmath3 as a subset of the distinct eigenvalues as follows : @xmath36 we say that vertices @xmath3 and @xmath18 are _ strongly cospectral _ if @xmath37 for all idempotents @xmath38 in the spectral decomposition .",
    "this property is necessary for both perfect and pretty good state transfer ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 3 ) ) .",
    "the spectrum of the adjacency matrix of the path ( see @xcite for example ) on @xmath6 vertices is @xmath39 note that they are indexed such that @xmath40 . for each @xmath41 ,",
    "the eigenvector corresponding to @xmath42 is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "the following lemma immediately follows .",
    "[ eq:3 ] vertices @xmath3 and @xmath18 of @xmath45 are strongly cospectral if and only if @xmath46 .",
    "we will make use of the following result , which is derived from ( * ? ? ? *",
    "theorem 2 ) , and completely characterizes pretty good state transfer .",
    "the second condition is an immediate consequence of kronecker s theorem ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4 ) ) .",
    "@xcite [ thm:1 ] let @xmath3 and @xmath18 be vertices in a path with @xmath6 vertices .",
    "then pretty good state transfer happens between @xmath3 and @xmath18 if and only if both conditions below hold .",
    "a.   @xmath47 . in this case , for all @xmath48 , define @xmath49 if @xmath50 , and @xmath51 if @xmath52 . b.   for any set of integers @xmath53 such that @xmath54 then @xmath55",

    "let @xmath61 . for vertices @xmath3 and @xmath4 , condition ( i ) of theorem [ thm:1 ] is satisfied with @xmath62 , by lemma [ eq:3 ] .",
    "the eigenvalues of the path @xmath45 belong to the cyclotomic field @xmath63 $ ] , where @xmath64 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath65 if @xmath66 , then the cyclotomic polynomial is @xmath67    we will proceed by showing that part ( ii ) of theorem [ thm:1 ] holds .",
    "if @xmath3 is a multiple of @xmath5 , suppose there is a linear combination of the eigenvalues in @xmath68 , satisfying @xmath69 where we make @xmath70 if @xmath71 .",
    "recall that the @xmath3th entry of the @xmath42-eigenvector is @xmath72 .",
    "we see that @xmath42 belongs to @xmath73 if and only if @xmath74 does not divide @xmath41 .",
    "we define the polynomial @xmath75 as follows : @xmath76 we see that @xmath77 is a root of @xmath75 and , since @xmath78 is the minimal polynomial of @xmath77 , we see that @xmath78 divides @xmath75 .",
    "let @xmath79 be the following polynomial : @xmath80    consider @xmath81 \\phi_{2m}(x ) q(x)$ ] .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath81 \\phi_{2m}(x ) q(x ) = [ x^k ] p(x)$ ] for @xmath82 .",
    "since the degree of @xmath79 is @xmath83 , we may conclude that @xmath79 is the unique polynomial of degree @xmath83 such that @xmath84 \\phi_{2m}(x ) q(x ) = [ x^k ] p(x)\\ ] ] for @xmath82 .",
    "in particular , the quotient @xmath85 is a polynomial of degree @xmath83 such that ( [ eq : eq1 ] ) holds , therefore @xmath86    from the coefficients of @xmath87 for @xmath88 , it follows that , for @xmath89 and @xmath90 , @xmath91 recall that @xmath92 for any integer @xmath93 .",
    "given @xmath94 , note that @xmath95 , and since @xmath96 , there is @xmath97 such that @xmath98 . if @xmath99 , then @xmath100 , and if @xmath101 , then @xmath102 .",
    "in either case , it follows that @xmath103 .",
    "therefore @xmath104 for all even @xmath41 .",
    "thus , we see that @xmath105 which concludes the proof .",
    "pretty good state transfer between end vertices of paths was classified in @xcite . in this paper , we have given an infinite family of paths where pretty good state transfer occurs between internal vertices , but not between the end vertices .",
    "a full classification of the orders @xmath6 where this occurs would be interesting and would complete the classification of pretty good state transfer in paths .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors study pretty good state transfer between the end vertices in a heisenberg chain ; they study the hamiltonian @xmath106 , where @xmath107 denotes the laplacian adjacency matrix . in this case , they show that pretty good state transfer occurs between the end vertices of @xmath45 if and only if @xmath6 is a prime congruent to @xmath10 modulo @xmath108 or @xmath6 is a power of @xmath19 .",
