    "in the long history of the mesoscopic physics , it is quite recent that it became possible to observe dynamic response of coherent systems in experiments  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , dynamical transport properties of the mesoscopic systems has been extensively investigated with the scattering theory  @xcite .",
    "one of the most intriguing results of the theoretical efforts is the universal quantization of charge relaxation resistance in mesoscopic capacitors  @xcite .",
    "the mesoscopic capacitors are quantum analogs of classical @xmath6 circuits , among which the simplest one ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dot ] ) consists of a quantum dot connected to an electron reservoir via a quantum point contact and capacitively coupled to an ac gate voltage .",
    "an electron entering the quantum dot relaxes to equilibrium in the scale of charge relaxation time @xmath11 .",
    "the dynamical resistance observed at this time scale is the so - called _ charge relaxation resistance_. it has been predicted by bttiker _",
    "_ that the charge relaxation resistance is quantized at half a resistance quantum @xmath12 irrespective of the property of the point contact  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the universal behavior has been confirmed experimentally  @xcite , which has further attracted the theorists interest in the charge relaxation resistance  @xcite .",
    "recently , we have investigated theoretically the charge relaxation resistance , treating electron interactions exactly  @xcite .",
    "we have considered a one - dimensional mesoscopic capacitor and predicted the followings ; the charging effect of the quantum dot has no influence on the quantization , while short - range interactions described by the luttinger parameter @xmath13 drastically affects the nature of the dynamical resistance .",
    "in contrast to the universal quantization at @xmath14 for @xmath15 , the kosterlitz - thouless transition occurs for @xmath16 and as a result one can not any more observe the universal charge relaxation resistance . in this paper , we extend our theory to discuss the quantum phase transition driven by a noisy gate voltage . how our treatment of the charging effect is related to the conventional picture of the scattering theory is also discussed by applying the mean field approximation",
    "the system we have in mind is the mesoscopic capacitor depicted in fig  [ fig : dot ] . due to the magnetic field",
    "applied perpendicular to the 2deg , a chiral mode called quantum hall edge state is realized along the @xmath8 axis .",
    "it has been shown by wen  @xcite that the edge state at filling factor @xmath0 ( @xmath17 is an odd integer ) is a chiral luttinger liquid , and its hamiltonian reads @xmath18 here the bosonic field @xmath19 describes the gapless edge excitations , whose velocity is denoted by @xmath20 .",
    "the narrow constriction on the point contact causes intra - edge tunneling of laughlin quasiparticles between @xmath21 and @xmath22 . since a laughlin quasiparticle at @xmath8",
    "is annihilated by the operator @xmath23 $ ] , the tunneling process is written as @xmath24,\\label{eq : tunneling}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the strength of quasiparticle tunneling . ) , we have omitted the phase that an edge mode gains along the circumference of the dot by shifting zero of the field @xmath19 . ] change in the dot charge @xmath26 in the range of @xmath27 is strongly restricted by the long - range interaction between electrons , i.e. , the charging effect . upon using the fact that the electron density is bosonized as @xmath28",
    ", one can see that the term describing the charging effect takes the form @xmath29\\right)\\label{eq : charging}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the geometrical capacitance essentially determined by the charging effect .",
    "when the gate voltage is oscillating at a low frequency @xmath31 , the admittance of the quantum @xmath6 circuit can be expanded as @xmath32 , from which the charge relaxation resistance @xmath5 is obtained .",
    "note that the electrochemical capacitance defined by @xmath33 in general differs from @xmath30 , since , e.g. , the quasiparticle tunneling induces coulomb blockade oscillation in @xmath34 .",
    "the above expansion of @xmath35 is possible only when the @xmath11 is finite ; if the phase transition occurs , @xmath11 diverges faster than @xmath36 as @xmath37 , so that one can not even regard @xmath5 as the charge relaxation resistance  @xcite .",
    "at a glance , our formalism described in the previous section looks slightly different from the scattering theory  @xcite , where the charging effect is incorporated through an effective gate voltage @xmath38 in the quantum dot .",
    "clearly , the latter treatment is justified when fluctuation of the dot charge @xmath26 is negligible enough that one can approximate the interaction of an electron with the others in the dot with an effective potential created by mean charge @xmath39 .",
    "thus one can expect that the two - capacitor obtained from the scattering theory  @xcite is reproduced by applying the mean field theory to our model . in this section ,",
    "we first confirm this and compare the results of the scattering theory and our calculation where the interaction is exactly treated . upon neglecting higher orders in @xmath40 in the charging term ( [ eq : charging ] ) , we obtain @xmath41 where we have dropped constant terms . since an electron in the dot behaves as a free particle subject to the effective potential @xmath38 , the mean charge can be also expressed using the density of states in the dot @xmath42 as @xmath43 @xmath44 is called quantum capacitance since it reflects the nature of standing wave of an electron in the dot . by eliminating @xmath38 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mean - charge1 ] ) and ( [ eq : mean - charge2 ] ) , we can calculate the electrochemical capacitance @xmath45 thus in the mean field approximation @xmath34 is reduced to a series combination of of the classical part @xmath30 and the quantum part @xmath44 , in agreement with the results of the scattering theory @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath46 oscillates as @xmath47 is varied .",
    "for an integer quantum hall edge state at @xmath4 , one can refermionized the hamiltonian to solve the transport problem with the effective potential @xmath38 with the scattering theory .",
    "then the charge relaxation resistance quantized at @xmath48 will be also reproduced .",
    "one might conjecture that the mean field assumption is valid in the limit of weak quasiparticle tunneling @xmath49 , where the potential that dot charge @xmath26 feels is almost harmonic , so that the charge fluctuation is suppressed upon lowering temperature .",
    "indeed , we can exactly derive quantized charge relaxation resistance @xmath2 up to second order in @xmath25  @xcite , but a qualitative difference between the mean field theory and our exact result emerges in the capacitance . from the perturbative result  @xcite ,",
    "one can split @xmath34 into two parts mimicking eq .",
    "( [ eq : series ] ) : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a numerical factor oscillating as a function of @xmath47 , and @xmath52 is the circumference of the dot . for @xmath4 ,",
    "@xmath53 can be identified as the quantum capacitance , since it coincides with the small @xmath25 limit of @xmath44 obtained from the scattering theory , while @xmath54 differs from the geometrical capacitance by the oscillating factor .",
    "the latter is because the mean field approximation underestimates the charge fluctuation ( @xmath55 capacitance ) due to electron tunneling between the dot and the reservoir , which should oscillate depending on @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , one can see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : series2 ] ) that in the small @xmath25 limit , @xmath34 is a series combination of @xmath54 and @xmath56 , which reflect the particle and wave natures of an electron , respectively .",
    "it is clear that the mean field theory breaks down at charge degenerate points @xmath57 ( @xmath58 is an integer ) for large @xmath25 , where the charge fluctuation can be finite down to low temperatures . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have shown that the charge relaxation resistance for @xmath1 is always quantized at @xmath2 owing to the so - called charge - kondo effect  @xcite , where two degenerate charge states @xmath59 and @xmath60 play the role of up and down spins of a magnetic impurity   has been also discussed in ref .  @xcite . ] .",
    "more surprisingly , charge relaxation resistance becomes ill - defined due to the kosterlitz - thouless transition for @xmath3 , and the observed dynamical resistance @xmath5 diverges with lowering temperature .",
    "the phase transition mentioned in the previous section occurs for a fractional quantum hall edge state such as @xmath61 . in the rest of this paper",
    ", we discuss another possibility for the phase transition by considering a noisy gate voltage connected to an ohmic bath .",
    "such a situation can be realized , e.g. , by connecting a long @xmath62 transmission line in series with the gate voltage  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the caldeira - leggett bath of an infinite number of harmonic oscillators reads @xcite @xmath63,\\label{eq : bath}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the strength of interaction between the @xmath65th oscillator and the dot charge @xmath26 . @xmath66",
    "denote the normal coordinate , momentum , mass , and frequency of the @xmath65th oscillator .",
    "for an ohmic bath with impedance @xmath67 , the spectral density of the environmental coupling satisfies @xmath68 below , we see how dissipation influences the behavior of charge relaxation resistance . to this end",
    ", we derive the euclidian effective action for the system consisting of the mesoscopic capacitor and the ohmic bath . by integrating out the quadratic degrees of freedom except @xmath69 and @xmath70 from the kinetic term ( [ eq : kinetic ] ) ,",
    "we first obtain the effective action for the mesoscopic capacitor @xmath71 + \\int\\rmd\\tau\\left [ \\frac{e_{c}}{\\pi^{2}}\\{\\phi(\\tau)\\}^{2 } -\\frac{ev_{g}}{\\pi}\\phi(\\tau)\\right].\\label{eq : action_mc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath72/2 $ ] , @xmath73 is the fourier transform of @xmath74 , and @xmath75 is the charging energy .",
    "similarly , we can derive the effective action for the bath from eq .",
    "( [ eq : bath ] ) as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the strength of dissipation .",
    "one can expect from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : action_mc ] ) and ( [ eq : action_e ] ) that the coupling to the ohmic bath renormalizes the filling factor @xmath0 , which influences the critical point . to discuss the quantum phase transition of the mesoscopic capacitor ,",
    "let us focus on the degeneracy point in the large @xmath25 region . in this case",
    ", electron tunneling occurs between the dot and the reservoir with small tunneling strength @xmath78 .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we can straightforwardly identify the scaling equations at low frequencies @xmath79 : @xmath80t,\\qquad { \\frac{\\rmds^{2}}{\\rmdl}}=-4s^{2}t^{2}\\qquad(0<s\\lesssim 1),\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] which describes the kosterlitz - thouless transition .",
    "one can see from these equations that , for @xmath81 , the tunneling strength always grows upon decreasing temperature . for @xmath82 ,",
    "on the other hand , it is possible that for sufficiently large @xmath25 ( small @xmath78 ) that the system is renormalized to a weak coupling configuration with specified charge . it should be noted that , unlike in ref .",
    "@xcite , the critical phase transition occurs even in the case of an integer quantum hall edge ( @xmath4 ) when the bath impedance exceeds half a resistance quantum , @xmath83 . otherwise , the system flows towards the kondo fixed point as @xmath37 , and the charge relaxation resistance is given by the value for @xmath49 as @xmath84 , i.e. , the noisy gate voltage results in the shift of the quantized value by the bath impedance @xmath67 .",

    "@xmath0 is the filling factor , and @xmath85 is the strength of dissipation , where @xmath67 is the bath impedance .",
    "the charge relaxation resistance is universally quantized in the white region , while it can undergoes a phase transition for sufficiently strong quasiparticle tunneling in the gray region . ]",
    "we have theoretically studied the phase transition of dynamical resistance in a mesoscopic capacitor applied a perpendicular magnetic field . for weak quasiparticle tunneling",
