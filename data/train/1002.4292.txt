    "in this paper we use the definition of a generic subset of a countable set , introduced in definition 4.1 of @xcite ( see also subsection [ subsec_genericity ] below ) , to investigate whether for each fixed genus @xmath1 the set of high distance heegaard splittings is generic in the set of all irreducible heegaard splittings . for this purpose",

    "@xmath3 on a closed surface @xmath0 , i.e. two curve systems which both decompose @xmath0 into pair - of - pants .",
    "we define the set @xmath4 of such pairs @xmath5 , by requiring the pairs to have the additional property that they do not have _ waves _ ( see definition [ smallwave ] ) with respect to each other .",
    "a pair of such curve systems , which determine a heegaard splitting that is of distance greater or equal to some @xmath6 , will be said to belong to @xmath7 . for precise definitions",

    "our main result is :    * theorem [ large_distance_snows_are_generic ] . * _ let @xmath0 be a closed surface of genus @xmath1 .",
    "then for any integer @xmath8 the set @xmath9 is generic in the set @xmath4 . _",
    "the fact that a heegaard splitting is high distance has important consequences for the geometry of the @xmath10-manifold determined by it .",
    "hence the question , raised in the title of this paper , is natural and relevant . indeed , since the distance is measured in the _ curve complex _",
    "@xmath11 , which is not locally finite , it is a priory not clear , despite of the fact that @xmath11 has infinite diameter , whether one should expect random points in @xmath11 to be close or far away from each other .",
    "the question becomes even less evident if asked for subsets of @xmath11 with infinite diameter , such as the handlebody sets @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which are used to determine the distance of a heegaard splitting @xmath14 , see section [ prelims ] .",
    "there are several ways to attack this question , and this paper presents one which is described in detail in subsection [ mando ] .",
    "j. maher @xcite has provided another such approach , based on random walks in the mapping class group and the issuing notion of a `` random 3-manifold '' , which was introduced and investigated by n. dunfield and w. thurston in @xcite .",
    "it is well known that making mathematical sense of the term `` generic '' is particularly problematic when considering subsets of countable sets @xmath15 . in the `` classic '' setting a set @xmath16 would be called _ generic _ if and only if the complement @xmath17 is finite .",
    "this definition is very restrictive and , in practice , there are many cases where intuitively one would like to call a set generic , yet it does not satisfy this criterium . a common method to deal with this situation",
    "is the following : one considers a family of finite subsets @xmath18 that exhaust @xmath15 ( typically given by enumerating @xmath19 , and by defining @xmath20 ) .",
    "one then computes the the ratio @xmath21 , and defines @xmath22 to be generic if @xmath23 tends to 1 .",
    "of course , the obtained limit ratio depends heavily on the particular chosen enumeration of @xmath15 .",
    "another difficulty with statements about `` genericity '' is that of _",
    "double counting_. a typical example here is to count group presentations instead of groups , so that the same group may well be counted several times , or even infinitely often .",
    "the problem arises when in the given mathematical context it is impossible to count the objects in question directly , so that double counting becomes unavoidable .    in this paper",
    "we do indeed consider a countable set @xmath15 as base set , but we use the fact that our set @xmath15 is given as subset of a space @xmath24 that is already equipped with a natural measure , or rather , measure class .",
    "this enables us to use the following definition , which was introduced in a previous paper @xcite .",
    "it is motivated by the observation that a `` generic '' point with rational coordinates in the unit square @xmath25 \\times [ 0 , 1]$ ] should rightfully be expected to lie in the interior rather than on the boundary of @xmath25 \\times [ 0 , 1]$ ] .    [ generic ]",
    "let @xmath24 be a topological space , provided with a borel measure @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath27 be a ( possibly countable ) subset , which is a disjoint union @xmath28 .",
    "the set @xmath22 is called _ generic in @xmath15 _ ( or simply _ generic _ , if @xmath29 ) if the closure @xmath30 of @xmath22 has measure @xmath31 , and the closure @xmath32 of @xmath33 has measure @xmath34 .",
    "( here `` closure '' always means `` closure in @xmath24 '' . )",
    "notice that in this definition the sets @xmath35 and @xmath32 may well not be disjoint , although @xmath22 and @xmath33 are assumed to be disjoint . note also , that this definition of genericity extends to sets @xmath15 that are not embedded but are just mapped to @xmath24 , by a properly chosen `` natural '' map .",
    "furthermore , note that this definition does not depend on the actual measure @xmath26 but rather only on its measure class .",

    "we will specify precisely in the next subsection the sets @xmath41 and the measure @xmath26 that are used in this paper .",
    "the borel measure space @xmath24 , as in the last subsection , that is used in this paper is the space @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the space of projective measured laminations on a `` model surface '' @xmath0 of genus @xmath1 .",

    "however , in order to focus on the objects of our primary interest , namely heegaard splittings , we have to be more careful , in order to avoid a potential double - counting problem as evoked in the previous subsection :    a _ marked heegaard surface of genus @xmath2 _ is a surface @xmath48 of genus @xmath2 embedded in a 3-manifold @xmath49 , with handlebody complementary components @xmath50 and @xmath51 , which is equipped with a _ marking homeomorphism _ @xmath52 .",
