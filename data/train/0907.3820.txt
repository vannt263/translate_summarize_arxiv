    "several different mechanisms have been proposed as explanations for solar coronal heating and indeed it is likely that a number of different heating processes are responsible for the extreme temperature values found .",
    "much of the corona is considered to be close to force - free , that is , in a state satisfying @xmath2 .",
    "this consideration led to the proposal of one of the earliest and most debated coronal heating theories , that of topological dissipation ( parker , 1972 ) .",
    "parker theorized that the coronal magnetic field is unable to relax to a smooth force - free equilibrium following arbitrary perturbations of the field via footpoint motions and the consequence is a development of tangential discontinuities in the field .",
    "magnetic reconnection may then occur across the resulting current sheets . since parker s original paper a multitude of arguments for and against the hypothesis have been given but no unanimity presently exists ( e.g.  van ballegooijen , 1985 ; galsgaard & nordlund 1996 , craid & sneyd 2005 ) .",
    "one technique presently employed for predicting current sheet formation in continuous fields is to examine a quantity known as the squashing factor , @xmath0 ( titov _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 ; see appendix a for further details of the function itself ) .",
    "this is a measure for continuous magnetic fields which describes the level of squashing of an infinitesimal flux tube ; @xmath0 is large in regions where the footpoint mapping of the field is highly distorted .",
    "regions of very high @xmath0 outline so - called quasi - separatrix layers or qsls ( priest & dmoulin 1995 ) and can be considered as an analogue of the separatrix surface in configurations with no null points .",
    "qsls are thought to be sites of preferential current sheet formation ( dmoulin _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ; titov _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 ) and a number of numerical experiments have supported this hypothesis ( e.g.  longcope & strauss 1994 ; milano _ et al . _  1999",
    "; galsgaard _ et al . _ 2003 ; aulanier _ et al . _",
    "in addition , observational studies have attempted to examine the relation between qsls and current sheets ( e.g. schmieder _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ; fletcher _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) although this is difficult due to the spatial resolution and quality of the data required for an accurate depiction of the qsls .    in an earlier paper ( wilmot - smith _ et al_.  2009 ) we considered a class of braided magnetic fields .",
    "the braids were initially given in closed form ( and not in mhd equilibrium ) , then inserted into a numerical scheme and underwent magnetic relaxation towards a force - free equilibrium .",
    "in that paper the current structure of the fields was looked at in some detail .",
    "the results are summarized for convenience and put into context in section  3 . here",
    "we return to these models for braided fields in order to examine the relationship between qsls , currents and a quantity which is important for magnetic reconnection in three dimensions , the electric current integrated along magnetic field lines .",
    "as such we begin by describing the braided fields under consideration .",
    "in wilmot - smith _ et al_.  2009 , ( hereafter paper i ) we introduced a class of braided fields designed to model magnetic fields in solar coronal loops .",
    "the fields are given as @xmath3 , @xmath4 , where @xmath3 can be considered as a concatenation of @xmath5 times the ` elementary ' field @xmath6 .",
    "the braided field @xmath7 is modelled on the pigtail braid as illustrated in figure  [ fig:100 ] .",
    "the nature of @xmath6 and the construction mechanism for @xmath3 may be seen from that figure .",
    "the field @xmath6 consists of two localized regions of twist in an otherwise uniform field .",
    "these two regions are of opposite sign but are of the same underlying form  the superposition onto a uniform vertical field , @xmath8 , of a toroidal flux ring given by @xmath9 in cartesian coordinates , placing the centre of this region of toroidal flux at the point @xmath10 we have @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is taken throughout . the closed form expression for @xmath6",
    "is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 and , similarly , that for @xmath3 by @xmath17 with appropriate choices for the parameters @xmath18 .",
    "for each field @xmath3 we are able to find the equations of the magnetic field lines in closed form and hence an exact expression for @xmath0 for each @xmath5 can be easily calculated .",
    "in paper i a lagrangian numerical scheme ( craig & sneyd , 1986 ) was used to carry out an ideal relaxation of @xmath7 towards a force - free state with the field on the boundaries of the domain fixed . the maximum lorentz force within the domain",
    "decreased by two orders of magnitude during the relaxation and the resultant field is close to force - free ( for a precise definition of what is meant by ` close ' see section  3.2 of paper i ) . beyond this point problems with the numerical accuracy of the scheme ( pontin _ et al .",
    "_ , 2009 ) mean no further relaxation is possible until the numerical difficulties are resolved . in the relaxed state for @xmath7",
    "the current is smooth and of a large - scale ( see figure  3 of paper i )  two regions of current extend vertically throughout the domain and the maximum magnitude of the current , ( @xmath19 ) , is around half of that of the initial state . no evidence for current sheet formation in the ideal relaxation was found .",
    "it is well known that continuous motions on the boundary of an initially smooth magnetic field can not lead to truely _ singular _ current sheets under an ideal ( line  tied ) evolution ( van ballegooijen 1985 ) .",
    "however it might seem that the lack of current sheets in our relaxed state contradicts previous results , for example those of longbottom _ et al . _  ( 1998 ) and galsgaard _ et al . _  ( 2003 ) .",
    "these investigations found the formation current concentrations under shearing motions on the boundary of an initially current - free configuration .",
    "since we can think of our braid as having been created by a sequence of such shearing motions applied to an initially homogenous field , we might also expect to find similar current concentrations in the relaxed state .",
    "a closer comparison , however , shows that the twist , measured by the ratio of the displacement distance ( @xmath20 ) to the length of the domain ( @xmath21 ) in which current concentration are observed is comparatively high in the experiments of longbottom _ et al . _  ( 1998 ) and galsgaard _ et al _ ( 2003 ) .",
    "in particular , longbottom _",
    "et al . _  ( 1998 ) looked in detail into this question and found significant build - up of current for values above @xmath22 ( @xmath20= ` shear amplitude ' in their terminology and @xmath23 ) . if we were to create our elementary braid @xmath6 ( which comes closest to the configuration they considered ) by a similar shearing pattern , we would obtain a ratio @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ; @xmath26 ) .",
    "this is a value for which no noticeable current concentration has been observed ( see figure 2 of longbottom _ et al . _  1998",
    ") in agreement with our findings .",
    "a similar argument applies to the conditions under which galsgaard _ et al . _  ( 2003 ) found current concentrations , although their experiment does not allow a direct comparison as they used a resistive code . in their case ,",
    "values of @xmath20 ( ` shear distance ' in their terminology , @xmath23 ) below @xmath27 also showed no significant build up of current .    while this shows that our results do not contradict previous findings of current sheet formation , it is perhaps still surprising that a smooth near force - free equilibrium for such a complex configuration exists . in order to understand this one has to bear in mind that our equilibrium is not an exact force - free state but only close to a force - free state ( for an exact definition how close see section 3.2 of paper i ) .",
    "if the residual forces in the relaxed state could be balanced by a pressure , our relaxed state would have a plasma beta of @xmath28 ; although this is well within the quality of ` force - freeness ' usually assumed for magnetic loops in the solar corona , it is not zero .",
    "moreover , the field has comparatively low maximum force - free field parameter @xmath29 ( when measured in a dimensionless way ) and it is known that for sufficiently small values of this quantity , force - free equilibria exist for arbitrarily braided fields ( bineau , 1972 ) . unfortunately the proof given does not give an explicit upper bound but only provides the existence of such a number .",
    "these two properties , a low @xmath29 and an only approximately force - free state , appear to allow for a sufficiently large space of smooth solutions to encompass the braids we have investigated .",
    "whilst in two - dimensions the current itself is the crucial quantity for magnetic reconnection , in three - dimensions the integrated parallel electric field along magnetic field lines plays an important role ( hesse & schindler , 1988 ) . in resistive mhd , the parallel electric field",
    "is related to the parallel current by the relation @xmath30 ( assuming a uniform resistivity @xmath31 ) .",
    "motivated by this consideration , in paper i we examined the integrated parallel current , hereafter denoted by @xmath32 , in both the initial and relaxed states for @xmath7 . in both cases a highly filamentary structure containing multiple thin @xmath32 layers was found . during the relaxation the spatial structure of @xmath32",
    "was approximately conserved .",
    "more generally , by considering @xmath3 for various @xmath5 , the thickness , @xmath33 , of the @xmath32 layers was found to decrease exponentially with @xmath5 ( degree of braiding ) .    a quantity proposed as an indicator for the formation of current sheets ( and",
    "hence for the occurrence of magnetic reconnection ) in continuous fields is known as the squashing factor , @xmath0 ( titov _ et al . _  2002",
    "; titov _ et al . _",
    "layers in which @xmath0 is large , so - called quasi - separatrix layers ( qsl ) , can be understood as a generalisation of separatrix surfaces for cases where no null points exist in the domain under consideration .",
    "our previous findings motivate a consideration of the nature of @xmath0 in the class of braided magnetic fields @xmath3 .",
    "we relate these findings both to the current structure and the integrated parallel current structure of the fields .",
    "a method for obtaining the squashing factor @xmath0 in the braided fields considered is outlined appendix a. note that for @xmath3 the squashing factor @xmath0 and the newer definition of the slip - squashing factor ( titov 2007 , titov _ et al .",
    "_ 2009 ) give the same result since the magnetic field is normal to both @xmath34-boundaries .",
    "we begin the discussion by considering the simplest field , @xmath6 . under ideal relaxation towards a force - free equilibrium ,",
    "the current , @xmath35 , in @xmath6 remains smooth and large - scale , with the maximum value being @xmath36 in the relaxed state ( compared with @xmath37 initially ) .     as a function of field line positions on the lower boundary of @xmath6 and ( _ right _ ) integrated parallel current along field lines , @xmath38 , on the same boundary for the field @xmath6 .",

    "recall that a smooth equilibrium with only large - scale current structures was obtained in an ideal relaxation of this field .    the squashing factor @xmath0 on the lower boundary of the domain is shown in the left - hand image of figure  [ fig:0 ] .",
    "here the maximum value of @xmath0 is @xmath41 ( with @xmath0 calculated at @xmath42 points on the lower boundary ) and regions of enhanced @xmath0 occur in a multitude of thin layers in a large portion of the domain . between these layers",
    "@xmath0 drops significantly , even to its minimum possible value of @xmath43 in many locations .",
    "a typical half - width at half - maximum ( hwhm ) of the qsls is @xmath44 or @xmath45% of the domain width .",

    ", scaledwidth=108.0% ]    considering now @xmath0 alone for the various fields @xmath3 , we seek to determine how the maximum value of @xmath0 and the characteristic width ( specifically hwhm ) , @xmath50 , of the layers of high @xmath0 depend on @xmath5 .",
    "it is found that the maximum of @xmath0 for @xmath3 , @xmath51 , in the domain increases exponentially with @xmath5  as shown in figure  [ fig:2](a )  for which a best fit line is @xmath52 in paper i a linear increase in the maximum of @xmath32 with @xmath5 was found , as expected since the vertical length of the domain is also increasing linearly by construction of the fields .",
    "the typical width , @xmath50 , of the regions of enhanced @xmath0 decreases with @xmath5 .",
    "more precisely , there is an exponential decrease in @xmath50 with @xmath5  as demonstrated in figure  [ fig:2](b )  for which a best fit line is @xmath53 in paper i a similar exponential decrease in the width ( @xmath54 ) of regions of high @xmath32 was found .",
    "we now address the dependence of the maximum value of @xmath0 , @xmath51 on @xmath5 .",
    "recall that @xmath51 was found to increase exponentially with @xmath5 .",
    "notice that by the construction of @xmath3 we may place an upper bound on the maximum value of @xmath0 from the method of its calculation by composition of matrices . letting @xmath55 denote the maximum value of @xmath0 for @xmath56 , then the submultiplicative property of the @xmath57 norm tells us that @xmath58 evaluating , we obtain the upper bound as @xmath59 whilst the true dependence is given by @xmath60 the dependence on the smaller power then comes from the filling factor of the field @xmath6 , i.e. the number of points on the lower boundary of @xmath6 with highest @xmath61 that get mapped under @xmath62 to points with high @xmath61 for the next composition ( for @xmath63 etc . )    in the next section we seek to explain these findings and explore theoretically the relationship between @xmath0 and the current structures .",
    "as mentioned above , the squashing factor has been suggested as an indicator for the formation of current sheets .",
    "layers in which @xmath0 is large outline quasi - separatrix layers ( qsls ) .",
    "the link between qsls and current sheets relies on the following hypothesis ( referred to below as the qsl  hypothesis ) . where @xmath0 is high there is a sensitive dependence of the end points of magnetic field lines on the starting points ( or vice - versa since @xmath0 is symmetric ) .",
    "hence certain motions of the plasma on one boundary ( particularly those crossing the qsls ) would lead to very high velocities at the other boundary , provided the evolution is ideal and the magnetic configuration is unaffected by this perturbation . for sufficiently high @xmath0",
    "this is inconsistent with @xmath64 and so the magnetic configuration has to change .",
    "then a lack of neighbouring smooth equilibria can lead to the formation of current concentrations or even current sheets .    within the experiments described above we are in a position to test the qsl ",
    "hypothesis , given that we can think of the relaxed configuration for @xmath7 as as an ideal deformation of the initial configuration .",
    "the initial configuration shows an abundance qsls but no strong current concentrations . in the subsequent ideal relaxation",
    "the qsls remain but no current sheets ( in the sense of a sheet - like structure of @xmath35 ) form .",
    "this result appears to contradict the qsl  hypothesis .",
    "there are , however , two ways in which the system can escape the necessity of forming current concentrations .",
    "firstly , the deformation applied could be unfavourable for the formation of current sheets ( titov _ et al . _",
    "for example , galsgaard _ et al .",
    "_  ( 2003 ) considered a configuration containing two intersection qsls and applied two types of deformations on the boundary .",
    "they found that only one of the types of deformation lead to significant build - up of current .",
    "given the complexity of our configuration , it seems unlikely that all of the motions which occur during the relaxation are of the type unfavorable for the formation of current sheets unless the nature of the deformation applied ( @xmath65 ) excludes any such favorable deformation .",
    "the second possibility is that following the applied deformations the system is able to adjust to a neighbouring smooth equilibrium .",
    "this possibility is supported by the arguments given in section  3 that our final state is a low alpha , near force - free state .",
    "although current layers are not found in our experiment , it does show layer - like structures of @xmath66 .",
    "such layers have a broader definition in that only the integral of @xmath35 and not @xmath35 itself needs to show small scales .",
    "the following example , however , shows that there is no simple relation between either @xmath0 and @xmath35 or between @xmath0 and @xmath66 .",
    "we have chosen this example because it is locally similar to the braided fields discussed , in that in both cases @xmath0 and @xmath32 each have a layer - like structure , with multiple layers in which the quantities are enhanced .",
    "consider the force - free magnetic field @xmath67 for which @xmath68 with @xmath69 , and take @xmath70 $ ] , @xmath71 . on the lower boundary , @xmath72",
    ", we have @xmath73 @xmath74 and @xmath75 here the relationship between @xmath0 and currents crucially depends on the choice of parameters . setting @xmath76 , for example , maxima and minima of @xmath0 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 coincide . setting instead @xmath79 ,",
    "then minima in @xmath0 correspond to both maximal and minimal regions of @xmath38 or @xmath80 ( see figure  [ fig : exqj ] ) . here",
    "we see that the maxima of @xmath0 increase quadratically with the vertical extent ( @xmath81 ) of the domain under consideration , whilst the maxima of @xmath32 increase only linearly and the maxima of @xmath80 are independent of @xmath81 .",
    "( solid line ) and @xmath40 ( dashed line ) for the illustrative example of a particular 1d force - free field ( described in section  5 ) . here",
    "@xmath82 . in this example @xmath0 is not a good predictor of current features .",
    "( parameters : @xmath79 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85.),scaledwidth=100.0% ]    note that this is a specific illustration of a more general case of a force - free field @xmath86 with force - free parameter @xmath87 . taking @xmath88 $ ] then on the lower boundary @xmath89 while @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "the above described situation corresponds well to the braided fields @xmath3 in that both @xmath0 and @xmath32 have a layer - like structure .",
    "for @xmath3 we also find that there is no exact correspondence between the layers of high @xmath0 and greatest @xmath32 .",
    "however , there is a similarity between @xmath0 and @xmath32 in terms of their global structure , particularly for moderate and large @xmath5 ( see figures [ fig:0 ] and [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "this similarity comes not from an inherent relation between @xmath0 and @xmath32 but rather from the fact that both quantities are functions of the field lines .    .",
    "for the function @xmath92 , the left hand image shows @xmath93 centre image shows @xmath94 and the right hand image shows @xmath95 .",
    "as @xmath96 is repeatedly applied to the function the image develops small scales ; for this reason since @xmath0 and @xmath32 take ( by definition ) one value on each field line , they too must develop small scales on the boundaries of @xmath3 for increasing @xmath5.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    to see this , we prescribe a smooth function ( @xmath97 ) of field lines on the lower boundary of each of the braided fields @xmath3 , @xmath98 .",
    "we then map this function ( @xmath99 ) along field lines of @xmath3 to the upper boundary , i.e. find @xmath100 .",
    "this is demonstrated for a specific example in figure  [ fig : simpleexample ] for @xmath56 , @xmath101 .",
    "as @xmath96 is applied repeatedly to any function @xmath97 , then the characteristics of the map will result in a stretching and contracting of @xmath99 in some regions of the domain according to the nature of @xmath96 at those locations , specifically the lyapunov exponents of the map . after repeated application of @xmath96 any two functions will appear similar ; the apparent structure of the two functions will be determined by the mapping @xmath96 .    from this observation",
    "we deduce that the structure of both @xmath0 and @xmath32 will depend crucially on the plane in which they are viewed and , by the symmetry of the braid , have the same scale on both the lower and upper boundaries .",
    "accordingly , @xmath32 will , for sufficiently high @xmath5 ( about @xmath102 in this case ) , have a filamentary distribution on the lower boundary that is reflective of the field line mapping rather than the ` underlying ' nature of the parallel currents .",
    "these properties are confirmed by illustrating @xmath0 and @xmath32 for @xmath7 in a cross - section in the middle of the domain ( @xmath72 ) , thereby subtracting as much as possible the effect of the field line mapping .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : centre ] where the quantities are seen to attain larger scales than on the domain boundaries and less similarity between @xmath0 and @xmath32 is apparent .     as a function of field line position in the central plane ( @xmath72 ) for the field @xmath7 and ( _ right _ ) integrated parallel current along field lines , @xmath40 , for the same field , also in the central plane.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]   as a function of field line position in the central plane ( @xmath72 ) for the field @xmath7 and ( _ right _ ) integrated parallel current along field lines , @xmath40 , for the same field , also in the central plane.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]",
    "in this paper we have examined the link between the squashing factor @xmath0 and current structures in a class of braided magnetic fields . the squashing factor ( titov _ et al .",

    "the consequence was shown to be that for a coronal field with any finite resisitivity , after a certain degree of braiding via photospheric motions the field will undergo a loss of equilibrium due to the high gradients in @xmath32 , regardless of the current structure itself .    here",
    "we have investigated the nature of the squashing factor @xmath0 and associated qsls for the fields @xmath3 .",
    "a method was given ( appendix a ) to calculate @xmath0 exactly , a property that becomes important in the analysis where extremely small scales in the quantity are found .",
