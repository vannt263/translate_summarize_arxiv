    "elastic network models of proteins , including all - atom models@xcite and coarse - grained models@xcite represent some of the simplest and most powerful types of theoretical models that can accurately reveal structure - dynamics relationships and the mechanisms underlying a protein s functional activities @xcite .",
    "such models have also been widely employed to accurately reproduce the temperature factors on the crystal structure of a protein via normal - mode analysis .",
    "these models can thus demonstrate the large and slow deformations of proteins that are essential for protein functions , but remain difficult to demonstrate via all - atom molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "along with proteins , dna is the most important biomolecule for the activities of all living organisms .",
    "recent developments in molecular biology have revealed that dna contains several functional regions .",
    "therefore dna is no longer considered to have the sole function in the storage of genetic information , but is now known to be actively involved in gene regulation@xcite , insulator activity@xcite , and in the construction of chromosomal architectures@xcite such as heterochromatins and topologically associated domains through nucleosome formation and protein bindings@xcite .",
    "the functional behavior of each strand of dna is determined not only by chemical aspects of the nucleotides and base pairs but also by its physical characteristics such as the structure and dynamics of the nucleotide sequences in each functional region .",
    "however , comprehensive understanding of the physical properties of nucleotide sequences lags far behind the knowledge accumulated of their biochemical aspects @xcite .",
    "since the last century , much progress has been made in revealing the physical aspects of dna using all - atom normal - mode analysis@xcite and molecular dynamics simulations@xcite .",
    "several coarse - grained models of dna ( and rna ) have also been proposed .",
    "some of these describe the detailed shape of each nucleotide using three or more particles@xcite , whereas others describe each base pair by simply one or two particles@xcite .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations and normal - mode analysis of these models have identified the flexibilities , nucleosome - forming abilities , and zip - unzip transitions of the double helices of some specific dna sequences from tens to a few hundred base pairs in length .",
    "although these methods have proven to be very powerful for the analysis of the physical aspects of dna , molecular dynamics simulations are not suitable for conducting exhaustive analyses of several sequences simultaneously owing to the high computational costs of such extensive simulations ; for example , analyses of whole genomic and whole possible sequences . moreover , the normal - mode analysis of all - atomic models of long dna sequences is also computationally heavy .",
    "alternatively , data - driven methods have been proposed for determining the mechanical properties of dna with respect to the helical parameters and local flexibilities of base pairs from x - ray crystal structure analysis and all - atom molecular dynamics @xcite .",
    "these methods also seem to be powerful and can be applied to the analysis of the mechanical properties of several dna sequences simultaneously .",
    "however , the methods thus far proposed have focused on static and local mechanical properties .",
    "therefore , they are not particularly useful for the study of the functional contribution of the dynamic and correlated motions of dna .",
    "the objective of this study was to construct a simple coarse - grained elastic network model of dna to allow for exhaustive analysis of the dynamic correlated motions of several long dna sequences .",
    "for this purpose , we first constructed a simple all - atom elastic network model of short dna sequences based on the method introduced by tirion@xcite for the modeling of protein dynamics .",
    "we confirmed that this model could accurately reproduce the temperature factors of some dna fragments from data obtained with x - ray crystal structure analysis .",
    "second , we developed a simple coarse - grained elastic network model of long dna sequences , where each nucleotide is described by only one node .",
    "we confirmed that this simplified model has lower computational costs but can nonetheless reproduce the nucleotide sequence - dependent dynamics revealed by the all - atom elastic network model .",
    "finally , through the normal - mode analysis of this coarse - grained model , we conducted an exhaustive analysis of the general features of the sequence - dependent structure - dynamics relationships among several dna sequences .",
    "we specifically focused on the dynamic properties of a large number of long dna sequences , approximately @xmath0 bp in length ( with respect to the length of the nucleosome - forming regions ) , for the genomes of some model organisms as well as for random sequences with several a , t , c , g ratios . through these analyses",
    ", we found that the dynamic aspects of dna are highly influenced by their sequences , and found positive correlations between the nucleosome - forming abilities and inter - strand fluctuations of double - stranded dna .",
    "in particular , we focus on the geometry dependencies of the dynamics of several dna sequences , since a recent study demonstrated that the geometry of dna sequences has a dominant contribution to their mechanical features@xcite . in the following arguments , for simplicity , we use `` sequence - dependent '' to mean `` dynamics that depend on sequence geometry '' .",
    "in order to construct elastic network models of dna , the basic dna structure first needs to be determined . in the following arguments , we construct two types of models : i ) a simple all - atom elastic network model ( aaenm ) to reproduce the characteristics of the crystal structures of dna , and ii ) a simple coarse - grain elastic network model ( cgenm ) to reproduce the characteristics of the aaenm .",
    "we obtained the basic dna structures in the following two ways for the respective purposes of constructing each model .    for construction of the aaenm , we employed the atom coordinate sets of several naked dna crystal structures included in the protein data bank ( pdb ) as the given basic structures of the model .",
    "we used @xmath1 dna crystal structures containing only dna and water molecules under different conditions of crystallization , where all temperature factors are given as positive values ( table 1 ) .",
    "the suitability of the model was evaluated by comparisons of the temperature factors obtained between the model and those obtained from x - ray crystal structure analysis .",
    "the objective of our constructed arguments was to unveil the sequence - dependent dynamic features of several long dna sequences simultaneously . in recent crystal structure analysis , only shorter dna sequences ( i.e. , less than @xmath2 bp in length ) were studied . on the other hand ,",
    "several types of helical parameter sets , base pair parameters , and base step parameter sets have been proposed through experiments or molecular dynamics simulations@xcite(table 2 , ) . here , we used the application x3dna@xcite to obtain the coordinates of each atom for any sequence from these helical parameters , and used these parameters to construct the aaenms and cgenms of longer dna sequences ( for detailed methods of the generation of the atom coordinates , see lu and olson @xcite ) .",
    "in the following arguments , we compare the characteristics of the aaenm and cgenm constructed by x3dna from three different helical parameter sets : i ) a parameter set obtained by an _ in vitro _ experiment and x - ray crystal structure analysis@xcite ( table 2 ) , ii ) a parameter set obtained only by the x - ray crystal structure analysis , and iii ) a parameter set obtained by all - atom molecular dynamics simulations@xcite ( ) .",
    "a simple all - atom elastic network model of double - stranded dna was constructed based on the model proposed by tirion@xcite . in this model",

    "the results of the arguments presented in this paper were qualitatively unchanged for the appropriate range of @xmath11 .",

    "this term plays a crucial role for the analysis of the fluctuations of the crystal structure of dna , such as temperature factors , since the fluctuations of the nucleotides at the edges of dna and water molecules are restricted due to the following facts .    in the crystal of dna , the motion of edges at upper and lower streams of each dna segment ( left and right edges in fig .",
    "1(a ) ) is influenced by atoms of other adjacent segments in the long - axis direction of dna segments .",
    "moreover , the motions of water molecules around each dna segment are influenced by atoms of other adjacent water molecules or dna segments in the direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the dna segment .",
    "thus , we need to consider the second term of eq .",
    "( 1 ) to implement such effects , where @xmath22 indicates the strength of such effects for atoms in the edge nucleotides of each dna and water molecule , respectively .",
    "remarkably , as shown in the results section , the distributions of the temperature factor of atoms exhibited various patterns from the same sequence of crystallized dna ( and ) owing to the dependency on the conditions of crystallization .",
    "therefore , in order to compare the characteristics of the present dna model to those of the crystal structure of dna , appropriate values of @xmath23 need to be assigned to the atom @xmath24 that belongs to the edge base pairs and water molecules . for simplicity , we assign @xmath25 and @xmath26 to the atoms @xmath24 at the edge base pairs and the water molecules , respectively , and @xmath27 otherwise .",
    "it is noted that the internal structure of the crystal of dna is spatially anisotropic .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to assume that the interactions among local parts of the crystal of dna exhibit different strengths in different directions .",
    "accordingly , in general , the strengths of the restrictions of atoms belonging to the edge of dna differ from those of water molecules .",
