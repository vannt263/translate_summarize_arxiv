    "the nucleon axial form factor is of fundamental significance to weak interaction properties and to the pion - nucleon interaction .",
    "hence it provides one important test for theories that attempt to describe the structure of the nucleon .",
    "the current status of the experimental and theoretical understanding of the axial form factor of the nucleon is reviewed in  @xcite .",
    "based on the original development of chiral quark models with a perturbative treatment of the pion cloud  @xcite-@xcite , we recently extended the relativistic quark model suggested in  @xcite to describe the low - energy properties of the nucleon  @xcite-@xcite . in references",
    "@xcite-@xcite we developed the so - called perturbative chiral quark model ( pcqm ) in application to baryon properties such as : sigma - term physics , electromagnetic form factors of the baryon octet , @xmath0 scattering and electromagnetic corrections , strange nucleon form factors , electromagnetic nucleon - delta transition , etc . in the present work",
    "we follow up on the earlier investigations and employ the same model in order to study the axial form factor of the nucleon .",
    "the pcqm is based on an effective chiral lagrangian describing quarks as relativistic fermions moving in a self - consistent field ( static potential ) @xmath1 which is described by a sum of a scalar potential @xmath2 providing confinement and the time component of a vector potential @xmath3 .",
    "obviously , other possible lorenz structures ( e.g. , pseudoscalar or axial ) are excluded by symmetry principles .",
    "it is known from lattice simulations that a scalar potential should be a linearly rising one and a vector potential thought to be responsible for short - range fluctuations of the gluon field configurations  @xcite . in our study",
    "we approximate @xmath4 by a relativistic harmonic oscillator potential with a quadratic radial dependence  @xcite @xmath5 the model potential defines unperturbed wave functions for the quarks , which are subsequently used to calculate baryon properties .",
    "this potential has no direct connection to the underlying physical picture and is thought to serve as an approximation of a realistic potential .",
    "the vector part of the potential is also a pure long - ranged potential and is not responsible for the short - range fluctuations of gluon fields . in general , we need a vector potential to distinguish between quark and antiquark solutions of the dirac equation with an effective potential .",
    "note , that this type of the potential was extensively used in chiral potential models  @xcite,@xcite-@xcite .",
    "a positive feature of this potential is that most of the calculations can be done analytically . as was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite,@xcite-@xcite and later on also checked in the pcqm  @xcite-@xcite , this effective potential gives a reasonable description of low - energy baryon properties and can be treated as a phenomenological approximation of the long - ranged potential dictated by qcd .",
    "baryons in the pcqm are described as bound states of valence quarks supplemented by a cloud of goldstone bosons @xmath6 as required by chiral symmetry .",
    "the chiral symmetry constraints will in general introduce a nonlinear meson - quark interaction , but when considering meson as small fluctuations we restrict the interaction lagrangian up to the quadratic term in the meson fields . with the derived interaction lagrangian",
    "we do our perturbation theory in the expansion parameter @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 is the pion leptonic decay constant in the chiral limit ) .",
    "we also treat the mass term of the current quarks @xmath9 as a perturbation . dressing",
    "the baryonic three - quark core by a cloud of goldstone mesons corresponds effectively to the inclusion of sea - quark contributions .",
    "all calculations are performed at one loop or at order of accuracy @xmath10 .    to be consistent , we use the unified dirac equation with a fixed static potential both for the ground and for the excited quark states . in the appendix",
    "we give details of the solutions to the dirac equation for any excited state .",
    "inclusion of excited states should be handled consistently .",
    "first of all , one should guarantee conservation of local symmetries ( like gauge invariance ) .",
    "second , excited states should be restricted to energies smaller than the typical application scale @xmath11 gev of low - energy approaches .",
    "an alternative possibility to suppress the inclusion of higher - order excited states is to introduce a meson - quark vertex form factor  @xcite . solving the dirac equation with a relativistic harmonic oscillator potential  ( [ v_hop ] )",
    "one can show , that the energy shift between the first low - lying @xmath12 excited states and the @xmath13 ground state is about 200 mev .",
    "the excited states ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) lie about @xmath16 mev above the ground state .",
    "the @xmath17 and the @xmath18 states are 530 mev heavier when compared to the ground state .",
    "as soon as the typical energy of the ground - state quark is about 540 mevone can restrict to the low - lying @xmath12 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 excited states with energies smaller than the typical scale @xmath19 gev .",
    "the requirement of convergence of physical observables when including excited states is physically not meaningful since it takes states with very large energies where the phenomenological low - energy approaches break down .",
    "one of us showed in ref .",
    "@xcite that the inclusion of excited states to the nucleon and @xmath20 masses can be convergent when using a linearly rising confinement potential , e.g. , the use of potential with a quadratic radial dependence leads to a nonsatisfactory convergence .",
    "however , this statement is sensitive to the quantity one is testing . on the other hand ,",
    "our approach has some different features in comparison to previous ones ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite,@xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "in particular we perform a consistent renormalization procedure when we include meson cloud effects .",
    "it gives additional contributions to physical quantities which were not taken into account before . in ref .",
    "@xcite we demonstrated that excited quark states ( @xmath12 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) can increase the contribution of loop diagrams but in comparison to the leading order ( three - quark core ) diagram this effect was of the order of @xmath21 .",
    "this is why we were interested to study these effects for the example of the axial form factor .",
    "again , we truncate the set of excited states to the @xmath12 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 state with energies which satisfy the condition @xmath22 gev . we do not pretend that we have a more accurate estimate of the whole tower of excited states .",
    "the scheme we use is thought to take the excited states into account in an average fashion .",
    "we showed that the zeroth - order value of the axial nucleon charge is not changed much in the presence of meson cloud effects in consistency with chiral perturbation theory . as an extention of previous work , which is dominantly aimed to describe the low - energy static properties of baryons , we consider the model prediction for the axial charge and for completeness also for the axial form factor .",
    "no further parameters are adjusted in the present work .    in the present paper",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "first , we describe the basic features of our approach : the underlying effective lagrangian , the unperturbed , that is valence quark , result for the nucleon description together with the choice of parameters and a brief overview of perturbation theory when including the meson fields .",
    "the full details of the renormalization technique can be found in reference  @xcite . in section iii",
    "we concentrate on the detailed analysis of the nucleon axial form factor in our approach .",
    "we derive analytical expressions in terms of fundamental parameters of low - energy pion - nucleon physics ( weak pion decay constant , strong pion - nucleon form factor ) and of only one model parameter ( radius of the three - quark core of the nucleon ) . numerical results in comparison with data",
    "are presented to test the phenomenological implications of the model .",
    "finally , section iv contains a summary of our major conclusions .",
    "following considerations lay out the basic notions of the perturbative chiral quark model ( pcqm ) , a relativistic quark model suggested in  @xcite and extended in  @xcite-@xcite for the study of low - energy properties of baryons . in this model",

    "the previous result , where the quark propagator is restricted to the ground state , is contained in the curve denoted by total(gs ) .",
    "the inclusion of the intermediate excited states tends to induce a cancellation of the original pion cloud corrections generated for the case of the ground state quark propagator , thereby regaining approximately the tree level result . in fig.5",
    "we give for completeness the full result for @xmath182 including excited states in comparison with experimental data and with the dipole fit using an axial mass of @xmath185 gev and normalized to @xmath186 at zero recoil .",
    "the model clearly underestimates the finite @xmath187-behavior , but it should be noted that a similar effect occurs in the discussion of the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon  @xcite .",
    "the stiffness of the form factors can be traced to the gaussian ansatz of the single quark wave functions and can also be improved when in addition resorting to a fully covariant description of the valence quark content of the nucleon  @xcite .",
    "hence the applicability of the pcqm is mostly for static quantities and low @xmath187 observables of baryons .    for the comparison with the data near @xmath188 we first turn to the results for the axial charge , @xmath189 . in table 1",
    "we list the numerical values for the complete set of feynman diagrams ( fig.2 ) , again indicating separately the contributions of ground and excited states in the quark propagator .",
    "the prediction for the axial charge including loop corrections are relevant for several reasons : 1 ) the tree level result for @xmath142 was previously adjusted to fix one ( @xmath64 ) of the parameters .",
    "since loop corrections essentially do not change this results , the previous model predictions remain meaningful ; 2 ) the predicted small loop corrections to @xmath142 are consistent with similar results in chiral perturbation theory ; 3 ) the generic role of excited states in loop diagrams are rather relevant in understanding the nucleon properties .",
    "this role was already exemplified in the case of @xmath190 transition  @xcite and sigma - terms  @xcite and again is demonstrated in the case of @xmath142 .    for low - momentum transfers , that is @xmath191 gev@xmath192 , the axial form factor",
    "can be represented by a dipole fit @xmath193 in terms of one adjustable parameter @xmath194 , the axial mass ( or sometimes dipole mass ) .",
    "therefore , the axial radius can be expressed in terms of the axial mass with : @xmath195 a comparison of the experimentally deduced values for the axial mass and the axial radius with our model results is given in table 2 .",
    "in summary , we have evaluated the axial form factor of the nucleon and , more important , its low @xmath187 limits , such as the axial charge and the axial radius using a perturbative chiral quark model as based on an effective chiral lagrangian . since the pcqm is a static model ,",
    "lorentz covariance can not be fulfilled .",
    "approximate techniques to account for galilei invariance and lorentz boost effects were shown to change the tree level results by about @xmath21 .",
    "higher order , that is loop contributions , are less sensitive to these correction .",
