    "in high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) a neutron star or black hole orbits a massive early - type star and accretes matter either via roche - lobe overflow or from the stellar wind which powers the x - ray emission ( for recent reviews see nagase 1989 , white et al .",
    "1995 , bildsten et al .",
    "one divides the class of hmxbs according to the stellar type of the mass donor star into supergiant x - ray binaries with luminosity class i - ii ob star and be / x - ray binaries with luminosity class iii - iv be star companions .",
    "be / x - ray binaries form the larger sub - group of hmxbs .",
    "balmer emission lines in the optical spectrum and a characteristic infrared excess are attributed to the presence of circum - stellar material , probably forming a disk in the equatorial plane of the be star .",
    "be / x - ray binaries often show transient behaviour with two types of outbursts .",
    "x - ray outbursts repeating with the orbital period are most likely associated with the passage of the neutron star through the circum - stellar disk in an eccentric orbit while giant outbursts , often lasting longer than a binary period , probably arise from an expansion of the disk .",
    "currently about 100 hmxbs and candidates are known .",
    "nearly one third were found in the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) from which the majority is located in the small magellanic cloud ( smc , coe 1999 ) .",

    "optically identified hmxbs in the smc only one is securely associated with a supergiant system ( the x - ray pulsar smcx1 ) and from 11 of the 19 be / x - ray binaries x - ray pulsations were detected .",
    "five additional x - ray pulsars are yet to be identified , but are most likely also be systems .",
    "the location of such a large number of hmxbs at a similar distance makes the smc ideally suited for statistical and in particular spatial distribution studies of the population of hmxbs in a galaxy as a whole .",
    "recent surveys to look for h@xmath0 emission - line objects in the smc were performed by meyssonier & azzopardi ( 1993 , hereafter ma93 ) and murphy & bessell ( 1999 , mb99 ) .",
    "the survey of ma93 mainly covers the main body and eastern wing of the smc and their catalogue lists 1898 emission - line stars .",
    "the catalogue of mb99 covers nearly all the area where rosat pspc observations of the smc are available ( except the southern half of the most south - east observation ) but is less sensitive ( 372 objects , partially in common with ma93 ) .",
    "a main goal of ma93 and mb99 was to identify planetary nebulae in the smc , however , the catalogues also contain be stars .",
    "ma93 state that all three at the time of publication known b[e ] supergiants which were covered by the survey were detected .",
    "very few be / x - ray binaries were known in the smc until 1993 and it was not noticed that the be stars proposed as optical counterparts for smcx-3 , 2e0050.17247 and 2e0051.17304 were listed in ma93 as emission - line stars ( lin 198 , azv 111 and azv 138 , respectively ) . a correlation of the larger sample of",

    "[ fig - lx ] . to do this",
    "we intensively searched the literature on galactic be / x - ray binary systems .",
    "we derived 31 galactic sources with @xmath13 erg s@xmath6 which are summarized in table  [ tab - begal ] ( which should be mostly complete ) . the luminosity estimates of galactic systems are often hampered by uncertain distances and different energy bands of the observing instrument .",

    "x - ray luminosities derived from detectors sensitive at higher energies ( typically 0.5  10 kev ) might be up to a factor @xmath142 higher than those derived from rosat count rates ( see sect .",
    "3 ) which would shift the low - luminosity end in fig .  [ fig - lx ] by 0.3 dex to the right . however",
    ", such a shift would not change the overall distribution significantly .",
    "recently , in the galaxy several likely low - luminosity be / x - ray binaries were discovered by bepposax and asca ( 1saxj1324.4 - 6200 , angelini et al .",

    "however , the high absorption in the galactic plane makes the detection of low - luminosity x - ray sources in the rosat x - ray band and their optical identification difficult .",
    "this might explain the smaller number of low - luminosity be / x - ray binaries discovered so far in the galaxy compared to the smc and might suggest that the luminosity distribution of be / x - ray binaries is very similar in the smc and our galaxy . in this case many more such systems are expected to be found in our galaxy which would significantly contribute to the hard x - ray galactic ridge emission ( warwick et al .  1985 ) .",

    "1998 , mereghetti et al .",
    "2000 ) , somewhat different to the high - luminosity systems with strong outbursts and shorter pulse periods .",
    "the smc results suggest that the low - luminosity sources even dominate the be / x - ray binaries in number . from the fact that about one third of the already identified",
    "be / x - ray binaries is not listed in current emission - line catalogues even more such systems are expected to be found in the rosat x - ray source catalogues of the smc . on the other hand some of them will be observed with higher maximum luminosity in future outbursts , but if they indeed form a class of low - luminosity be / x - ray binaries like xper , the outbursts are expected to be small changing the luminosity distribution immaterial .    there is a large difference in the number of ob supergiant hmxbs between the galaxy and the smc . in the smc at most two such systems are identified ( smcx-1 and maybe exo0114.67361 ) resulting in an overall ratio of be to supergiant x - ray binaries of more than 20 . in the galaxy",

    "be / x - ray binaries evolve from binary star systems with typical total mass of @xmath1420 m@xmath15 within about 15 my ( van den heuvel 1983 ) while the more massive supergiant hmxbs are formed on shorter time scales .",
    "the latter therefore would trace more recent epochs of star formation than the be / x - ray binaries .",
    "the comparatively large number of be / x - ray binaries in the smc in this view suggests a burst of star formation about 15 my ago while relatively few massive early - type stars were born during the last few million years .",
    "it is remarkable that the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) may also have experienced a burst of star formation about 16 my ago as was derived from optical photometric surveys by harris et al .",
    "lmc and smc resemble in the relative composition of their x - ray binary populations , both rich in hmxbs but very few old low - mass x - ray binaries ( cowley et al .",
    "1999 ) , suggesting a common star formation history triggered by tidal interaction during close encounters of lmc , smc and milky way .",
    "however , according to present day modeling the last encounter occurred @xmath140.2 gy ago ( gardiner & noguchi 1996 ) , too early for the formation of the be / x - ray binaries we see today in x - rays .",

    "<S> a correlation of x - ray source and h@xmath0 emission - line object catalogues in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) shows that more than two thirds of the optically identified be stars in be / x - ray binaries are found as emission - line objects in the catalogues . on the basis of this result </S>",
    "<S> we propose up to 25 x - ray sources mainly from recent rosat catalogues as new be / x - ray binaries and give their likely optical counterparts . also for the five yet unidentified x - ray pulsars in the smc we propose emission - line stars as counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> this more than doubles the number of known high mass x - ray binary systems in this nearby galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial distribution of the new candidates is similar to that of the already identified be / x - ray binaries with a strong concentration along the smc main body and some systems in the eastern wing . </S>",
    "<S> the new candidates contribute mainly to the low - luminosity end of the x - ray luminosity distribution of be / x - ray binaries . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison with the luminosity distribution in the milky way reveals no significant differences at the high - luminosity end and the large number of low - luminosity systems in the smc suggests that many such systems may still be undetected in the galaxy </S>",
    "<S> . the overall ratio of known be to ob supergiant x - ray binaries in the smc is an order of magnitude larger than in the galaxy , however , might show spatial variations . while in the eastern wing the ratio is comparable to that in the galaxy no supergiant x - ray binary </S>",

    "<S> possible explanations include a different star formation history over the last @xmath1 my . </S>"
