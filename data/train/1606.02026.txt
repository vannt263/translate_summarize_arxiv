    "this paper is concerned with the problem of designing a shortest path network for vehicles .",
    "the paths in the network are subject to a curvature constraint that accounts for the minimum turning radius of the vehicles .",
    "interest in such networks is motivated by their relevance for designing the access in underground mines @xcite .",
    "the dubins network problem can be viewed as a novel combination of two problems that have been well - studied in the optimisation literature : the steiner problem and the dubins problem .",
    "what follows is a review of these two problems .",
    "some basic geometric and topological concepts primarily drawn from @xcite and @xcite are presented here in order to prepare the reader for subsequent sections .",
    "first , consider fermat s problem , which is a 3-terminal special case of the steiner problem :    given three points @xmath0 in the plane @xmath1 , find the point @xmath2 which minimises the sum of the distances @xmath3 .",
    "the uniqueness of @xmath2 , called the _ steiner point _ , is obtained from the convexity of the euclidean norm .",
    "if one of the angles of @xmath4 is at least @xmath5 , then @xmath2 is located at its vertex .",
    "otherwise , @xmath2 lies in the interior of @xmath4 , whose sides subtend angles of @xmath5 at @xmath2 .",
    "melzak @xcite proposed a ruler and compass construction for finding @xmath2 in the latter case .",
    "let @xmath6 be the third vertex of the equilateral triangle with @xmath7 and @xmath8 as its other two vertices , and whose interior lies outside that of @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath9 be the circle through @xmath10 .",
    "then @xmath2 is the intersection of @xmath9 and the _ simpson line _ @xmath11 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "[ h ! ]",
    "based on the above 3-terminal algorithm that substitutes @xmath6 for @xmath7 and @xmath8 , locates @xmath2 and adds the straight segments @xmath12 and @xmath13 , the melzak algorithm generalises to @xmath14 terminals ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the melzak algorithm yields all the minimising networks of the steiner problem :    given @xmath14 points @xmath15 in the plane @xmath1 , construct a shortest network interconnecting these @xmath14 points .",
    "some basic moves for constructing a shortest network are as follows .",
    "consider a network @xmath16 interconnecting @xmath14 points @xmath17 called _ terminals _ , in the plane @xmath1 .",
    "a _ steiner point _ is any vertex in @xmath16 other than a terminal .",
    "a steiner point must be of degree at least three . to see this ,",
    "a degree-1 steiner point can be deleted along with its incident edge to shorten the network .",
    "also , a degree-2 steiner point and its two incident edges can be deleted and replaced by a single edge .",
    "_ splitting _ a vertex @xmath18 is the operation of disconnecting two straight segments @xmath19 and connecting @xmath20 to a newly created steiner point @xmath2 .",
    "_ shrinking _ an edge @xmath21 is the reverse operation which returns the original graph .",
    "suppose that two straight segments @xmath19 meet at a vertex @xmath18 with an angle less than @xmath5 .",
    "then the network can be shortened by splitting at @xmath18 and solving fermat s problem for @xmath20 in order to locate the new steiner point @xmath2 .",
    "consequently , a steiner point must be of degree at most three .",
    "it follows that a steiner point must be of degree exactly three .",
    "gilbert and pollak @xcite called a local minimum network a _",
    "steiner tree_. the network is a local minimum in the sense that it can not be shortened by small perturbation of the steiner points , even when splitting is allowed .",
    "they called a global minimum network a _ steiner minimal tree_. a simple counting argument shows that a steiner tree with @xmath14 terminals has at most @xmath22 steiner points @xcite .",
    "a steiner tree with @xmath22 steiner points is called a _ full steiner tree_.    now consider the dubins problem in the plane .",
    "it is convenient to introduce some notation .",
    "a directed point is a pair @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a point in the plane @xmath1 and @xmath25 is a tangent vector in the tangent space @xmath26 based at @xmath24 . for simplicity ,",
    "such a pair is denoted as @xmath27 . given two directed points @xmath28 a path connecting these two directed points is called _ admissible _",
    "@xcite if :    a.   it is continuously differentiable .",
    "b.   it starts at @xmath29 and finishes at @xmath30 and has tangent vectors @xmath31 and @xmath32 at these two points respectively .",
    "c.   it is piecewise twice differentiable .",
    "there is a finite number of points at which the curvature is not defined .",
    "d.   where the curvature exists it is less than or equal to a fixed positive number @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the minimum radius of curvature .    without loss of generality , for the theory we will set @xmath35 throughout the paper .",
    "the dubins problem can be formulated as follows :    given an initial directed point @xmath36 and a final directed point @xmath37 , construct a shortest admissible path connecting these two directed points .",
    "dubins @xcite proved that such a path , called a _ dubins path _ , necessarily exists and consists of not more than three components , each of which is either a straight segment , denoted by @xmath16 , or an arc of a circle of radius @xmath34 , denoted by @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , such a path is necessarily a subpath of a path of type @xmath39 or of type @xmath40 .",
    "a well - known result states that if two points @xmath29 and @xmath30 are distance at least @xmath41 apart , then a shortest dubins path between any two directed points @xmath42 and",
    "@xmath43 is of type @xmath39 ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "from now on this paper adopts the convention that given two directed points @xmath44 , a path connecting these two directed points is admissible if the conditions ( i ) , ( iii ) and ( iv ) stated above are fulfilled and it has tangent vectors @xmath31 and @xmath45 at @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , when traveling from point @xmath29 to point @xmath30 .",
    "we do not specify a starting point , because none of the terminals in a network can be considered as initial or final when the number of terminals @xmath14 is greater than or equal to 3 .    given three directed points @xmath46 in the plane , a network interconnecting these three directed points is called _ admissible _ if :    a.   it is continuously differentiable except at any steiner point",
    ". b.   it interconnects @xmath47 and has tangent vectors @xmath48 at these three points respectively . c.   it is piecewise",
    "twice differentiable .",
    "there is a finite number of points at which the curvature is not defined .",
    "d.   where the curvature exists it is less than or equal to a fixed positive number @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the minimum radius of curvature .",
    "a 3-terminal version of the dubins network problem can be formulated as follows :    given three directed points @xmath49 construct a shortest admissible network interconnecting these three directed points .",
    "an example of such a network is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . by analogy with steiner trees ,",
    "a local minimum network is called a _ dubins network _ , whereas a global minimum network is called a _ minimum dubins network_.    [ h ! ]",
    "to simplify the analysis in this paper , we will focus on the full case of the 3-terminal problem .",
    "that is , we will focus on the case where the network has three edges of type @xmath50 meeting at a steiner point . on the other hand ,",
    "the degenerate case is not particularly interesting and consists of a concatenation of two dubins paths , or a slight modification thereof .",
    "determining the conditions under which the degenerate case occurs is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we begin our analysis with a preliminary proposition . to this end",
    ", it will be convenient to adopt the variational approach from the work of rubinstein and thomas @xcite on steiner trees .",
    "suppose that @xmath51 is a curve of type @xmath50 and that @xmath29 is held fixed while @xmath52 is varied .",

    "observe that the first variation of the vector @xmath61 is equal to the first variation of its head , i.e. @xmath56 , minus the first variation of its tail , i.e. @xmath64 . if the point @xmath52 is perturbed in the direction of @xmath56 , then the first variation of length of @xmath51 is    @xmath65    the _ weighted dubins network problem _ is analogous to the fermat - weber problem ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in the 3-terminal case ,",

    "the weights @xmath68 are the costs per unit length of the three paths .",
    "we seek to minimise the weighted sum of path lengths @xmath69 .",
    "we may appeal to a local argument in order to show that the angles at the junction are the same as those of a similarly weighted steiner tree . to that end , consider the 3-terminal case of the fermat - weber problem , which is to minimise the weighted sum @xmath70 . here",

    "an application of the law of cosines gives the angles @xmath78 at the junction in terms of the weights @xmath68 .",
    "for any 3-terminal dubins network whose paths are of type @xmath50 , the three dubins paths meet at angles @xmath79 determined as in the case of the fermat - weber problem",
    ".        it suffices to work locally . fix a small disk around the steiner point ( see fig .",

    ", we show just that .",
    "the length of an admissible network is convex with respect to the position of the steiner point .",
    "let @xmath51 be a curve of type @xmath50 where :    * @xmath54 is a helical arc of radius 1 . *",
    "@xmath55 is a straight segment .        in figure",
    "[ fig15 ] , @xmath29 is held fixed while the point @xmath30 moves along the vector @xmath220 and the point @xmath52 along the vector @xmath56 .",
    "let @xmath57 denote the length of @xmath51 .",
    "note that the helical arc is just a straight line segment wrapped around a cylinder .",
    "in other words , we can represent the helical arc by a vector @xmath221 lying in the plane . then according to proposition [ prop1 ] , the first variation of length of the helical arc @xmath54",
    "is given by @xmath222 , where the perturbation of @xmath30 in the direction of @xmath220 is tangent to the cylinder .",
    "on the other hand , the first variation of length of the straight line segment @xmath55 is given by @xmath223 .",
    "summing these two terms , we obtain for the first variation of length of @xmath51    @xmath224    by the product rule , the second variation of length of @xmath51 is    @xmath225    note that the first term is zero , because the perturbation of @xmath52 in the direction of @xmath56 is supposed to be linear .",
    "it is geometrically obvious that the angle between the vectors @xmath56 and @xmath226 is no greater than @xmath227 .",
    "hence the second variation of @xmath57 is nonnegative and @xmath57 is convex . since the weighted sum of convex functions is also convex , it follows that the length of the network is convex with respect to the position of the steiner point .",
    "we note that in the 3-terminal case , a weighted dubins network ( weighted steiner tree ) is the projection of an unweighted dubins network ( an unweighted steiner tree ) in @xmath228 . moreover , the 2d gradient is the projected 3d gradient .",
    "hence , with regards to the algorithm , the projected admissible network converges if and only if the admissible network converges .",
    "we have given algorithms to find minimal dubins networks for three directed points in the plane and in 3d space . for applications to mining , it is necessary to also incorporate a gradient constraint so the latter algorithm is only useful if the resulting network has gradient less than the maximum allowed . in @xcite , there is a discussion of how to find gradient constrained steiner trees in 3d space .",
    "so a challenge is to merge the methods in this paper and @xcite to find a full solution for the 3d gradient constrained dubins problem .    for more directed points in the plane , our 3 directed point method will generalise to find dubins networks , so long as the points are sufficiently far apart relative to the turning circle constraints .",
    "if the points are relatively close together , solutions which look like steiner trees with arcs of circles near the directed points will not be possible .",
