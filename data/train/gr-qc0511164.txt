    "astrophysical black holes have a minimum mass , known as the chandrashekhar mass .",
    "realistic matter in a star is almost stationary at the initial epoch of its collapse and has a characteristic scale which depends on the properties of matter .",
    "if one does not restrict to stationary realistic matter , then in principle one should be able to produce arbitrary small mass black holes from initially collapsing cloud , as there will not be any characteristic scale present in the cloud and the positive pressure in the cloud has tendency to push the matter in radially outward direction in spherically symmetric situation",
    ".    there can be very many possible equation of states with pressure present that the collapsing matter can satisfy , but the non - linear einstein equations are tractable analytically only for a very few equations of state .",
    "here , we examine a spherically symmetric collapse model , in which the radial pressure vanishes and non - zero tangential pressure is present in the cloud .",
    "the einstein cluster is such an example with vanishing radial pressure , where a cloud of rotating particles whose motion is sustained by an angular momentum has an average effect of creating a non - zero tangential stress .",
    "such a static system was first introduced by einstein @xcite , which was later generalized to non - static case @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the gravitational collapse models with a vanishing radial pressure have been investigated extensively by magli @xcite and others @xcite for the purpose of examining the validity or otherwise of the cosmic censorship conjectures and to understand the black hole and naked singularity formation in gravitational collapse .",
    "we observe an intriguing feature in this model that it has a threshold of black hole formation and it shows a power law behaviour for the mass of the black hole near this threshold .",
    "we work in the comoving coordinates @xmath0 and construct an effective potential for the collapsing shells , with the aid of which one can see transparently the various possible evolutions of the collapsing shells .",
    "we demonstrate for a set of initial data that the collapsing cloud either forms a black hole or completely disperses , depending on the values of initial parameters .",
    "we point out similarities in behavior of this model at the threshold of black hole formation with already established critical behavior seen in other matter models @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we discuss the collapse equations and regularity conditions and in section iii , a tangential pressure model is constructed . in section iv ,",
    "various possible dynamical evolutions are illustrated and a scaling relation for the black hole mass is obtained .",
    "discussion and conclusions are outlined in section v.",
    "we consider four dimensional spherically symmetric metric in comoving coordinates , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the line element on two - sphere .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor is then diagonal for any general _ type i _ collapsing matter field and is given as @xmath3 .",
    "this is a general class of matter fields that includes many known physical forms of matter @xcite .",
    "the quantities @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the density , radial and tangential pressures respectively .",
    "we take the matter field to satisfy the _",
    "weak energy condition _ , that is , the energy density measured by any local observer be non - negative .",
    "then for any timelike vector @xmath7 we have @xmath8 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath9 .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the system is determined by the einstein equations and for metric ( [ metric ] ) these are given as = , p_r=- , [ t6 ] (+ p_r)=2(p_-p_r)-p_r , [ t7 ] -2 + r+=0 , [ t8 ] g - h=1 - , [ t9 ] + where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are partial derivatives with respect to @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively and g(t , r)=e^-2r^2 , h(t , r)=e^-2 ^ 2 .",
    "the function @xmath14 is twice the misner - sharp mass for the collapsing cloud , which gives the total mass within the shell of comoving radius @xmath13 at time @xmath12 @xcite .",

    "it is seen from ( @xmath16 ) that the density of matter blows up when @xmath17 or @xmath18 . here",
    "@xmath18 corresponds to a _ shell - crossing _ singularity .",
    "we use the scaling independence of the coordinate @xmath13 to write , @xmath19 and we have @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the initial and singular epochs respectively",
    ". the condition @xmath23 signifies initially collapsing shells . at the initial epoch",
    "we have @xmath24 , i.e. @xmath25 , and at the singularity @xmath17 and @xmath26 . at all other",
    "epochs @xmath27 has a non - zero finite value for all @xmath13 with @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the boundary of the cloud .    from the point of view of dynamic evolution of initial data from @xmath30",
    ", we now have five arbitrary functions , given by @xmath31 .",
    "they are all not independent , ( [ t7 ] ) gives a relation for them . to preserve the regularity and smoothness of initial data",
    "we assume that the gradients of pressures vanish at the center , @xmath32 .",
    "thus we have a total of five field equations with seven unknowns @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , giving a freedom of choice of two free functions to complete the system .",
    "this choice , subject to the given initial data and weak energy condition , determines the matter distribution and metric of the space - time , leading to a particular dynamical collapse evolution of the initial data .",
    "in this framework , we now study a class of collapse models with vanishing radial pressure and non - vanishing tangential pressure , which have been studied extensively in recent years @xcite . for the sake of transparency , we construct and consider below an explicit collapse solution with a non - vanishing tangential pressure .",
    "we choose the allowed two free functions , @xmath14 and @xmath38 , in the following way .",
    "the vanishing or a constant @xmath5 implies that the mass function @xmath37 has to be necessarily of the form @xmath39 , where @xmath40 can be any general function of @xmath13 , and we also choose @xmath41 .    consider @xmath40 now be of the form @xmath42(r)=@xmath43e^-@xmath44r^2 , [ mass1 ] where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are positive constants .",
    "using the above form of mass function in equation ( [ t6 ] ) , we get @xmath47 , _ i.e. _ the radial pressure vanishes identically , and the density at initial epoch is given by @xmath48 . we also take the initial tangential pressure to be of the form @xmath49(t_i , r)=e^@xmath50r^2 - 1 , [ ptheta0 ] such that both @xmath49 and @xmath51 vanish at the center . we note that while the above profiles are chosen in order to give one particular solution , the following analysis is valid for any smooth initial data with initial density and pressure expressed in even powers of @xmath13 . in general , as @xmath52 , @xmath53 and the density blows up at @xmath17 , which is a curvature singularity as expected . using @xmath54 in equation@xmath55([t8 ] ) , we get @xmath56 where @xmath57 is another arbitrary function of @xmath13 . in analogy with dust collapse models , we write @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the energy distribution function for the collapsing shells .",

    "_ i.e. _ an initially collapsing cloud .",
    "the possible bounce of a shell is given by the change in sign of @xmath64 .",
    "the evolution of a particular shell is deduced from equation@xmath55([collapse ] ) . rewriting ( [ collapse ] ) in terms of @xmath27",

    "the allowed regions of motion correspond to @xmath68 , and dynamics of a shell can be studied by finding the turning points .",
    "starting from an initially collapsing state ( @xmath69 ) , there is a rebounce if @xmath70 ( at @xmath71 in fig.1 ) before the shell has become singular .",
    "this can happen when @xmath72 .",
    "hence , to study the various possible evolutions for a particular shell , we need to analyze roots of the equation @xmath72 , keeping the value of @xmath13 fixed .",
    "we have confirmed numerically that there is no shell - crossing in the cloud for a wide range of initial data of interest , which suggests that if a particular shell with comoving coordinate @xmath73 bounces then all the other shells with @xmath74 must also bounce .",
    "this implies that if central shell at @xmath75 bounces , then the whole cloud must also bounce off .",
    "this suggests that to investigate the situation when the whole cloud is just about to disperse off , it is sufficient to study the dispersal of the shells near the center . therefore , to find the threshold of black hole formation and to get the scaling relation for the mass of black hole",
    ", we need to analyze the model only near the center .    with the form of smooth initial data ( [ mass1 ] ) , ( [ ptheta0 ] ) , we can integrate ( [ t7 ] ) on @xmath30 , close to the center , and @xmath76 gives _ 0(r)=r^2 + ( ) @xmath50r^4 + [ nu1 ] we neglected higher order terms above since we want to consider the evolution of shells near @xmath75 only .",
    "near the center , equation@xmath55([gendyn ] ) can be written as v^2 a(r , v ) , [ dyn1 ] where @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the first factor in @xmath67 i.e function @xmath79 , being the @xmath80 term , is always positive and does not contribute to the bounce of shells .",
    "the main features of evolution of cloud derive from the second factor in @xmath67 , a quintic polynomial having five roots in general .",

    "since @xmath81 , any region between @xmath82 and the first positive zero of @xmath67 always becomes singular during collapse .",
    "the region between the unique positive roots is forbidden as @xmath83 there . for a particular shell to bounce it must therefore lie , during initial epoch ( @xmath84 ) , in a region to the right of the second positive root .",
    "we now study a configuration in which interesting possibilities for bounce and collapse arise when @xmath85 .",

    "this bounce occurs when their geometric radius approaches @xmath91 .",
    "if the initial data is chosen such that the discriminant vanishes , then the positive roots are equal and there is no forbidden region .    for @xmath85 a shell can evolve in three different possible ways : + i ) if the effective potential for a shell has two positive roots , _",
    "i.e. _ if it crosses the @xmath92 axis twice in the range @xmath93 $ ] ( see fig.1 ) , then the shell bounces off , as seen by differentiating equation ( [ gendyn ] ) to get @xmath94 . since near the turning point @xmath95 and @xmath96",

    "we take @xmath100 , then close to the center effective potential can be written as v a. [ dyn2 ]    we will see that for the above effective potential , depending on the values of initial parameters , three different types of evolutions of the collapsing cloud are possible in general .",

    "this is shown in fig .",
    "3 . the outer shells still have positive potential which indicates forbidden region , therefore , all those shells will bounce back .",
    "this configuration is the boundary point between the complete dispersal and black hole formation .",
    "+    * _ case c _ * + if we increase @xmath45 even further , the potential for the central shell ( fig .",
    "4 ) is negative for the whole range of @xmath27 which will allow the central shell to reach the singularity at @xmath26 .",
    "if we increase @xmath13 , the potential minima goes up , and there is a value of @xmath13 at which the effective potential just touches the @xmath92 axis .",
    "we call this radius the _ critical radius @xmath104 _ of the collapsing cloud for the chosen set of initial numbers",
    ". now all the shells from @xmath75 to @xmath105 will reach the singularity and will contribute to the mass of the black hole formed , but the shells with comoving coordinate more than @xmath104 bounce off .",
    "we numerically confirm this by integrating equation ( [ dyn1 ] ) .",
    "physical radius for various shells is plotted in fig .",
    "we can understand qualitatively why the solution for _ case b _ is a massless naked singularity .",
    "suppose we are in initial data parameter range of _ case c _ regime and we decrease the value of @xmath106 .",
    "as @xmath106 approaches @xmath103 fewer and fewer shells reach singularity .",
    "thus if we approach the threshold of black hole formation from the initial data of _ case c _ region , we can see that when @xmath106 is very very close to @xmath103 , almost only the central shell reaches singularity and other shells are stopped from collapsing and bounce back at the value of @xmath27 which is the root of the potential for those shells .",
    "apparent horizon is given by equation @xmath107 , which implies @xmath108 for the shells near the center .",
    "a shell is trapped if it reaches value of @xmath27 smaller than @xmath109 .",
    "now , as all outer shells reach a minimum value @xmath110 , those are not trapped .",
    "only the central shell is singular when @xmath106 is nearly equal to @xmath103 and trapped surfaces are not formed .",
    "as @xmath111 , the mass which contributes towards singularity formation is zero which means the singularity is massless and also as the trapped surfaces are not formed , the central singularity is visible .",
    "we note that in the collapsing cloud if a shell bounces then all the shells with larger value of comoving radius will also bounce , _",
    "i.e. _ there is no shell - crossing . to see this",
    ", we can integrate near the center numerically to obtain @xmath112 as well as all the metric functions .",
    "we see that @xmath112 remains positive during the collapse evolution which is plotted for one particular initial data set in fig .",
    "we find all solutions for various values of initial data and it was seen that for the critical solution as well as for solutions near the critical point shell cross does not occur .",
    "the expression for critical radius in terms of the initial parameters can be obtained from the condition that at critical radius , effective potential just touches the @xmath92 axis , _ i.e. _ the quintic polynomial has double roots . for a quintic polynomial @xmath113 ,",
    "the discriminant is given as follows @xcite ,    = a_5 .",
    "the condition that @xmath114 vanishes at the double root gives , from equation@xmath55([dyn2 ] ) , the expression for critical radius as ,    r_c^2= ,    where @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "behavior of the critical radius with the parameter @xmath45 can be seen in fig.7 .",
    "in the model considered here , the mass function , which is twice the misner - sharp mass , depends only on @xmath13 .",
    "the total mass which collapsed to form singularity from the regular initial profile is @xmath117 .",
    "the mass of black hole would then be m_bh= c_m(@xmath43-m_0c)^ , where @xmath118 is a constant near the threshold .",
    "we can fix any of the two parameters @xmath45 , @xmath119 , and @xmath99 and vary the third one to obtain the expression for critical radius . following the same procedure as earlier , it is easily seen that for @xmath119 and @xmath99 the same scaling relation and exponent exists near the threshold of the black hole formation .",
    "therefore , in general , for a parameter @xmath120 , we can write @xmath121 .",
    "we like to point out the similarities in the behaviour of this model with the critical behavior in scalar field gravitational collapse @xcite , and other matter models @xcite :    \\i ) the three types of evolutions discussed in _ case a - c _ are very much analogous to the _ subcritical _ , _ critical _ and _ super - critical _ evolutions studied in the above models . in case a the whole cloud disperse off and in case c black hole forms whose mass can be controlled by an initial parameter .",
    "case b is the boundary between the case a and case c configuration which is like the critical solution in the above cases .",
    "\\ii ) a power law behaviour is seen for the mass of the black hole near the threshold of its formation .",
    "infinitesimal mass black holes can be formed in this model if the initial parameters are finely tuned .",
    "\\iii ) the same value of exponent is observed for different initial parameters which is like universality of the critical solution .",
    "+ our purpose here is to investigate how the initial parameters determine the evolution and the end state of collapse . the metric function @xmath35 , in spite being a restrictive choice , makes the model tractable . the other class of tangential pressure models , _",
    "i.e _ non - static einstein cluster has a different form of the function @xmath35 in comoving coordinates and it can not be written as function of @xmath36 only . we have observed similar behavior at threshold of black hole formation in einstein cluster as well and the same value of the exponent was seen @xcite . the effective potential method for calculating",
    "the critical exponent applies to this case as well as to non - static einstein cluster @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the method applies at least for all mass - conserving systems .",
    "however , the system considered here has a limitation , and is different from the models considered so far for critical behaviour in one respect that it has no radial stress which enables shells to interact directly with each other",
    ". it will be interesting to explore whether the method we used here could be applied for studying such behaviour in the models with a non - vanishing radial pressure as well .",
    "+ * acknowledgments *    s. gutti , r. goswami and a. madhav are thanked for useful discussions .",
    "we can rewrite equation@xmath55([collapse ] ) as @xmath122 where @xmath123 integrating the above equation , we get @xmath124 the time of singularity for a shell at a comoving coordinate radius @xmath13 is the time when the physical radius @xmath125 becomes zero .",
    "the shells collapse consecutively , that is one after the other to the center as there are no shell - crossings .",
    "taylor expanding the above function around @xmath75 , we get t(v , r)=t(v,0)+.r|_r=0 + .|_r=0 [ eq : scurve2 ] let us denote @xmath126_n(v)=.|_r=0 as we have taken the initial data with only even powers of @xmath13 , the first derivatives of the functions appearing in above equations vanish at @xmath75 , hence we have @xmath126_1(v)=0 now we can express the next coefficient @xmath127 as @xmath126_2(v)=-_v^1 [ eq : scurve5 ] where = 6p__2 ^ 2 + 24 @xmath43b_02p__2 - 3 @xmath43_2p__2    we need to determine now whether it is possible to have families of future directed outgoing null geodesics coming out of the singularity . in the case when such families do exist which terminate in the past at the singularity , and which could reach outside observers ,",
    "then the singularity will be visible . in the case",
    "otherwise it is hidden within the black hole .",
    "another way to look at this is through the apparent horizon and formation of trapped surfaces in the spacetime . as the collapse evolves ,",
    "if the trapped surfaces form well in advance to the formation of the singularity , then the same will be covered . on the other hand ,",
    "if the trapped surface formation is sufficiently delayed during the collapse then the singularity may be naked .",
    "the apparent horizon within the collapsing cloud is given by the equation@xmath55 , @xmath128 , which gives the boundary of the trapped surface region of the space - time .",
    "if the neighborhood of the center gets trapped earlier than the singularity , then it is covered , otherwise it is naked with non - spacelike future directed trajectories escaping from it .    in order to consider the possibility of existence of such families , and to examine the nature of the singularity occurring at @xmath129 in this model , let us consider the outgoing null geodesic equation which is given by @xmath130 we now use here a method which is similar to that given in @xcite .",
    "the singularity curve is given by @xmath131 , which corresponds to @xmath132 .",

    "a specific value of alpha is to be chosen which enables us to calculate the proper limits at the central singularity .",

    "the term @xmath150 diverges in the above equation , and all such points on the singularity curve will be covered as there will be no outgoing null geodesics from such points .    hence we need to examine the central singularity at @xmath151 to determine if it is visible or not .",
    "that is , we need to determine if there are any solutions existing to the outgoing null geodesics equation , which terminate in the past at the singularity and in future go to a faraway observer , and if so under what conditions these exist .",
    "note that if any outgoing null geodesics terminate at the singularity in the past then along the same , in the limit as @xmath152 we then have from equation ( 26 ) @xmath153 , therefore @xmath154 and @xmath155 in this limit as @xmath150 vanishes .",
    "let now @xmath156 be the tangent to the null geodesics in @xmath137 plane , at the central singularity , then it is given by , @xmath157 using equation@xmath55([eq : null4 ] ) , we get , @xmath158 in the @xmath137 plane , the null geodesic equation will be , r = x_0u    it follows that if @xmath159 , then that implies that @xmath160 , and we then have radially outgoing null geodesics coming out from the singularity , making the central singularity to be a visible one . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath161 , we will have a black hole solution .",
