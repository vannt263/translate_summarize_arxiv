    "the issue of subspace confinement for qubit systems is fundamental to the primary operating assumptions of quantum processors . the concepts of universality , quantum gate operations , algorithms , error correction and fault - tolerant computation hinge on the precept that the fundamental quantum system is an isolated , controllable , two - dimensional system ( qubit ) .",
    "it is well known that most of the physical realizations of qubits are in fact multi - level quantum systems , which can theoretically be confined to a two - dimensional ( qubit ) subspace .",
    "important examples range from super - conducting qubits  @xcite to atomic systems such as cavity - coupled color centers  @xcite and ion traps  @xcite . in the former systems ,",
    "a qubit is generally defined as the subspace ( of the full hilbert space ) spanned by the two lowest energy states in an arbitrarily shaped potential such as the washboard potential of current - biased  josephson junctions  @xcite .",
    "however , the potential number of valid quantum states within each well is not limited to two , and quantum gates , especially if sub - optimally implemented , may inadvertently populate other confined states . similarly in ion trap systems , a qubit is usually defined by two electronic states of an ion , either two hyperfine levels or a ground state and a meta - stable excited state , but once again there exist many other electronic states .",
    "hence a more stringent definition of a qubit would consist of a two - level quantum system with classical control confined to the unitary group @xmath0 .",
    "the ability to initialize , operate and measure completely within the two - level subspace representing `` the qubit '' is vital to the successful operation of any large scale device constructed from such quantum systems .",
    "standard quantum error correction protocols ( qec )  @xcite generally assume that the qubit system is precisely confined to the two - level subspace and that all quantum gates operate only on the qubit degrees of freedom .",
    "if poor control or environmental influences inadvertently results in non - zero population of higher levels , leakage correction protocols are necessary .",
    "the issue of subspace leakage in quantum processing has been addressed in depth from the standpoint of error correction .",
    "work by lidar  @xcite examined the construction of leakage reduction units ( lru s ) , which use modified pulsing techniques to ensure that any unitary dynamics outside the qubit subspace can be compensated for which has been adapted specifically for super - conducting systems  @xcite .",
    "another type of lru s uses quantum teleportation  @xcite to map a multi - level quantum state back to a freshly initialized two - level qubit .",
    "finally , active detection such as non - demolition measurements ( which detect population in non - qubit states without discriminating between the qubit states ) can be performed on the system  @xcite .",
    "if an out - of - subspace detection event occurs the leaked qubit is re - initialized or replaced .",
    "the inclusion of lru s based on teleportation has been investigated within the context of fault - tolerant quantum computation  @xcite and shows that , in principle , the inclusion of leakage protection does not adversely affect large scale concatenated error correction .",
    "although these schemes are viable methods to detect and correct for improperly confined qubit dynamics , they can be cumbersome to implement and many systems admit , in principle , sufficiently confined hamiltonian dynamics so that leakage could be expected to be heavily suppressed .",
    "for example , for ion - trap qubits controlled by lasers , leakage to other ionic states can be made negligible by employing very finely tuned lasers and sufficiently long ( and possibly optimally tailored ) control pulses .",
    "advances in qubit engineering may therefore allow us to eliminate or at least substantially reduce the need for laborious leakage detection / prevention schemes in many cases , provided that we can experimentally ascertain sufficiently high confinement of manufactured qubits under classically controlled hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "in this paper we present a simple generic protocol to estimate qubit confinement , or more precisely , establish bounds on the subspace leakage rates , for `` quality control '' purposes .",
    "the main goal is to allow us to empirically detect inferior qubits by using readily obtainable experimental data to derive tight bounds on the subspace leakage of the system .",
    "this protocol would represent one of the first steps towards full system characterization  @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec : prelim ] briefly outlines the basic assumptions with respect to the measurement and control model and the motivation for the proposed protocol .",
    "section  [ sec : leakage ] discusses the basic mathematical properties of qubit oscillation data and shows how a minimal amount of information obtained from the oscillation spectrum can be used to derive empirical bounds on the subspace leakage rate , and that these bounds are very tight for the high quality qubits required for practical quantum computation . in section  [ sec : discrete ] , the effects of finite sampling are considered and studied using numerical simulations . section  [ sec : efficiency ] compares the efficiency of bounding confinement using the proposed scheme versus alternative approaches such as detection of imperfect confinement by identifying additional transition peaks within the rabi spectrum .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : decohere ] briefly examines the effects of decoherence .",
    "estimation of qubit confinement represents one of the first major steps in full qubit characterization .",
    "therefore , the protocol should not be predicated on the availability of sophisticated measurements or control , and should be amenable to automation so that it could be used in conjunction with a potentially automated qubit manufacturing process .",
    "the bounds on the subspace leakage will be based on the observable qubit evolution under an externally controlled driving hamiltonian .",
    "we assume that our classical control switches on the single qubit dynamics and that the governing hamiltonian is piecewise constant in time .",
    "hence the hamiltonian induces the unitary operator @xmath1 , with @xmath2 .",
    "although this assumption may not be applicable to all systems , e.g. , systems subject to ultra - fast tailored control pulses , it is not as restrictive as it might appear",
    ". it is generally be valid for systems such as quantum dots or josephson junctions subject to external potentials created by voltage gates if the gate voltages are ( approximately ) piecewise constant .",
    "it is also a good approximation for systems subject to time - dependent fields such as laser pulses in a regime where the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) is valid and the pulse envelopes can be approximated by square - waves . in this case , the hamiltonian relevant for our purposes is the ( piecewise constant ) rwa hamiltonian determined by the amplitudes , detunings and possibly phases of the control pulses .",
    "this model can even be valid for other pulse shapes if the hamiltonian is taken to be an average hamiltonian describing the effective dynamics on a certain time scale ( beyond which we do not resolve the time - dependent dynamics ) .",
    "however , the main focus of the paper is not when the dynamics of a system can be modeled in this way , but rather how to assess subspace confinement for systems where this model of the dynamics is valid .    assuming the effective control - dependent hamiltonian @xmath3 $ ] is constant for @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the classical  control knob \" parameter , the evolution during this time period is given by the unitary operator @xmath6 .",
    "although @xmath7 will generally depend on control inputs , we shall omit this dependence in the following for notational convenience .",
    "the driven system generally undergoes coherent oscillations , which are often referred to as rabi oscillations , especially for optically driven systems in the rwa regime .",
    "although our model is not limited to these systems , we shall use the terms coherent oscillations and rabi oscillations interchangeably throughout this paper .",
    "the measurement model assumed is crucial to the relevance of the protocol .",
    "some standard measurement models in quantum computation assume the ability to detect both the @xmath8 and @xmath9 states independently ( such as set detectors in solid state designs  @xcite ) . in this case , estimating subspace leakage is fairly straightforward and requires only repeated measurement of the system while undergoing evolution .",
    "the leakage is simply given by the deviation of the cumulative probability of measuring @xmath9 or @xmath8 from unity . however , this measurement model is not realistic for the majority of proposed systems .",
    "color centers and ionic qubits use externally pumped transitions to discriminate between a light state ( @xmath10 ) and other `` dark '' states , while readout in super - conducting systems  @xcite involves lowering a potential barrier such that only one of the qubit states can leak to an external detection circuit . the measurement outcome of the indirectly probed state is inferred from the non - detection of the directly measured state and for such measurement models estimating confinement is more complicated .",
    "hence this paper utilizes the latter model in order to quantify confinement .",
    "it should be noted that we are not considering the concept of weak measurement , in each case we assume that the measurement of the system causes a full povm collapse of the wavefunction .",
    "we also assume that the measurement apparatus has been sufficiently characterized . in order to to successfully implement computation ,",
    "readout fidelity should ideally be of the same order as general systematic and decoherence errors .",
    "therefore , characterization is initially required to ascertain the error rate associated with measurement which can then be incorporated into calculations of confinement .",
    "strong non - qubit transitions can still be identified directly via modulations in the rabi oscillations data as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : h1]b for a three - state system evolving under the trial hamiltonian @xmath11 however , the rabi oscillation data for the modified three - state hamiltonian , @xmath12 depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : h1]a shows that an apparent lack of modulations in the rabi oscillation data is not proof of perfect confinement , and that quantitative measures of confinement or subspace leakage and experimental protocols are needed .",

    "it is therefore desirable to derive bounds on the subspace leakage that only involve a few dominant and thus easily identifiable fourier peaks .",

    "for a well confined system this is a very small correction to @xmath60 , consequently the bound is again strong .    therefore , the subspace leakage @xmath16 is bounded above and below by @xmath61 note that this double inequality involves only the two main peaks in the fourier spectrum , i.e. , we can bound the subspace leakage _ without _ determining the heights of all peaks .    for the trial hamiltonians  ( [ eq : ham1 ] ) and ( [ eq : ham2 ] )",
    "we obtain the following bounds @xmath62 while the actual values of @xmath63 and @xmath64 are @xmath65 in both cases the upper bound for @xmath16 equals the actual value of @xmath16 .",

    "the previous section details how quantitative bounds on the subspace leakage can be obtained , in principle , from the fourier spectrum of the rabi data .",
    "however , to translate this method into a viable experimental protocol we need to consider the effects of finite sampling and taking the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) , which raises several issues .",
    "first the nyquist criterion for sampling  @xcite must be satisfied , i.e. , to avoid aliasing , some rough estimate of the rabi period @xmath71 is needed to guarantee that at least two sample points are chosen per oscillation period , i.e. , @xmath72 .",
    "the second issue that must be considered is the resolution of the fourier spectrum .",
    "the frequency resolution @xmath73 is given by @xmath74 , with @xmath75 the total observation time of the rabi signal .",
    "if the control hamiltonian induces a non - qubit transition with a frequency within @xmath73 of the primary peak then the dft will combine the amplitudes for qubit and non - qubit transitions in the same frequency channel thus leading to an overestimate of @xmath48 and hence qubit confinement . to avoid such problems",
    "it is necessary to ensure that the total observation time @xmath75 is long enough .",
    "thus , some estimates of the system parameters are required , although these do not need to be very accurate and will generally be known on theoretical or experimental grounds .    finally , the dft has the property that a pure sinusoidal signal will approach a delta function if there is zero phase difference between the start and the end of the observed signal .",
    "if this phase matching condition is not met then all frequency peaks will broaden .",
    "phase matching for system identification has already been addressed for the identification of single qubit control hamiltonians in  @xcite and we will follow the same approach , which essentially involves truncating the rabi oscillation data at progressively greater values of @xmath75 such as to maximize the trial function @xmath76 where @xmath77 represents the amplitude of the fourier spectrum at frequency @xmath78 and @xmath79 represents the frequency of the maximum fourier peak .",
    "the value of @xmath75 where @xmath80 is maximized represents the cut off time to the rabi signal that produced the best phase matching for the dft .    to simulate real experiments",

    "is determined by dividing the number of zero results by the total number of repeat experiments @xmath90 .",

    "we are therefore free to diagonalize the lower block of the hamiltonian , which also helps to simplify the comparison between different systems .",

    "we consider a perfectly confined qubit which undergoes markovian decoherence and hence can be described by the quantum liouville equation @xmath164 + \\sum_{k=1}^3 \\gamma_k \\mathcal{l}_k[\\rho ] \\label{eq : master}\\ ] ] where , @xmath165=([l_k,\\rho l_k^{\\dagger}]+[l_k\\rho , l_k^{\\dagger}])/2 $ ] , @xmath7 represents the single qubit control hamiltonian , and @xmath166 are the lindblad quantum jump operators , which describe the effect of the environment on the system , each parameterized by some rate @xmath167 .    for a basic decoherence analysis",
    "we restrict the lindblad operators to the pauli set , @xmath168 , and consider a perfectly confined , control hamiltonian of the form @xmath169.\\ ] ] this decoherence model is sufficient to describe pure dephasing as well as symmetric population relaxation processes in any basis , although not asymmetric relaxation processes .",
    "including each pauli lindblad term with an associated decoherence rate eliminates the problem of a preferential basis for qubit decoherence since any basis change of the overall system will only act to change the form of the hamiltonian .",
    "we can solve the master equation under this model by using the bloch vector formalism . expressing the density matrix as @xmath170 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : master ] ) takes the form @xmath171 , where @xmath172 and @xmath173 the rabi oscillations under this evolution are described by the function @xmath174 = ( 1/2)+z(t)$ ] , where @xmath175 , with an initial state @xmath176 . taking the fourier transform of @xmath27",
    "leads to the rather complicated general expression  ( [ eq : zw ] ) in appendix b. the real component of this function describes three lorentzians centered about @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "assuming that @xmath179 , we can expand eq .",
    "( [ eq : zw ] ) around @xmath177 and @xmath180 to obtain the functions [ see appendix b ] , @xmath181 where @xmath182 , @xmath183 and @xmath47 contains a @xmath184 offset due to the fact we are measuring the observable @xmath185 .",
    "in order to describe how the maximum peak of each lorentzian varies with @xmath186 we integrate @xmath47 and @xmath48 around an interval @xmath187 of the peak height @xmath188 hence , under decoherence the peak heights in the fourier spectrum vary as a function of the integration window @xmath187 and the decoherence rates @xmath189 .",
    "this is consistent since as @xmath190 , both @xmath191 functions approach @xmath192 and @xmath36 .",
    "the integration window @xmath187 is analogous to frequency resolution of the fourier transform @xmath73 , while the total area of the lorentzian is equal to the peak heights when @xmath193 .",
    "hence for small @xmath194 we can simply choose the resolution of the fourier transform such that the entire lorentzian is essentially contained within the data channel of the primary peak .",
    "consider the case where we wish to ensure that the subspace leakage does not exceed @xmath195 .",
    "using the upper bound for the subspace leakage ( [ eq : upper ] ) we have , assuming that the integration interval is approximately equal to the frequency resolution of the dft ( i.e. @xmath196 ) @xmath197 here the last line assumes that @xmath198 . when the rabi frequency is much greater than the inverse of the decoherence rate ( as necessary for any qubit realistically considered for quantum information processing ) , then the entire lorentzian broadening caused by decoherence will be contained within one frequency channel .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ eq : bound ] ) allows us to calculate the maximum frequency resolution of the fourier transform for successful leakage estimation using our protocol .",
    "for example , if @xmath199 and we wish to confirm that the subspace leakage is at most @xmath200 , then the resolution of the fourier transform can not exceed @xmath201hz if only the primary peak channels are used .",
    "obviously , this restriction on the frequency resolution can be lifted by including multiple channels around the central peak when estimating the peak area .",
    "although the decoherence model considered is not the most general possible case for an imperfectly confined control hamiltonian , this calculation demonstrates that the effect of decoherence does not void the protocol for estimating subspace leakage for a common decoherence model . a more detailed analysis considering a full @xmath18-level decoherence model , including the effect of spontaneous emission and absorption processes and the possibility of system - specific non - markovian decoherence is desirable but beyond the scope of the current paper .",
    "we have introduced an intrinsic protocol for  quantifying \" the degree of subspace leakage for a realistic ` qubit ' system .",
    "the protocol relies on very minimal theoretical assumptions regarding qubit structure and control , and utilizes a measurement model that is restrictive but extremely common to a wide range of qubit systems .",
    "we have introduced a quantitative measure of subspace leakage , and shown that the discretization noise as a result of finite sampling does not limit the ability of the protocol to quantify ( with appropriate error / confidence bounds ) the subspace leakage for well - confined ( near perfect ) qubits .",
    "the ability to experimentally characterize subspace leakage to a high degree of accuracy using automated , system independent methods , which rely on the intrinsic control and measurement apparatus of the quantum device ( required for standard quantum information processing ) will be vital for the commercial success of quantum nano - technology .",
    "this protocol represents one of the first steps in a general library of characterization techniques that will be required as `` quality control '' protocols once mass manufacturing of qubit systems becomes common .",
    "although , in this discussion , the qubit state @xmath24 is only defined through the strongest transition it should be emphasized that if confinement estimates are made on multiple control fields ( for example two separate hamiltonians which induce orthogonal axis rotations ) , the computational @xmath24 state _ must _ be common for both hamiltonians .",
    "this is not a significant problem , since for well engineered qubits , the computational @xmath24 state will be known on theoretical grounds .",
    "there are many open problems including subspace leakage estimates for systems undergoing a whole range of potential decoherence processes , quantifying confinement for multi - qubit control hamiltonians and combining these schemes with other proposed methods for system characterization .",
    "hopefully , in the near future , a complete set of characterization protocols will be developed which will augment large scale manufacturing techniques , allowing for efficient and speedy transition of quantum technology from the physics laboratory to the commercial sector .",
    "the following simulations examined the minimal number of ensemble measurements required to detect imperfect qubits either via the confinement equations or by directly detecting the third transition peak .",
    "three - level , four - level and six - level hamiltonians are found in the main text , the additional simulations were performed for all other multi - level systems up to ten levels .",
    "the general form of each of the trial hamiltonians are subsets of the ten - level system , @xmath202 where @xmath203 , @xmath204 and @xmath205 for @xmath206 .    for each lower level system the appropriate hamiltonian is simply formed by removing the appropriate number of rows and columns from @xmath207 ( i.e. compare @xmath208 and @xmath209 in eqs .",
