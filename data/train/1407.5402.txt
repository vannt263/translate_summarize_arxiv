    "although random matrices were originally introduced by john wishart @xcite in 1928 as a tool to study population dynamics in biology through principal component analysis , they became very popular much later in 1951 when wigner @xcite postulated that the fluctuations in positions of the energy levels of heavy nuclei are well described ( in terms of statistical properties ) by the eigenvalues of a very large hermitian random matrix .",

    "the linear statistics of the point processes with joint probability density functions ( jpdf ) @xmath11 have been extensively studied in the literature with different methods @xcite .    in 2002 ,",

    "those tri - diagonal matrices have been very useful in the last decade , leading to important progress on the understanding of the local eigenvalues statistics in the limit of large dimension @xmath7 for general @xmath12 . at the edge of the spectrum ,",
    "it was first proved @xcite that the largest eigenvalues converge jointly ( when zooming in the edge - scaling region of width @xmath13 around @xmath14 ) to the low lying eigenvalues of a random schrdinger operator called the stochastic airy operator ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "similar results were proved for the bulk in @xcite by valk and virg . for @xmath15 belonging to the wigner sea @xmath16 , the authors of @xcite consider the point process @xmath17 where @xmath18 is distributed according to @xmath5 and @xmath19 is the wigner semi - circle density . indeed , the mean level spacing around level @xmath15 for the points with law @xmath5 is approximately @xmath20 when @xmath21 . the mean point spacing of @xmath22 defined in is therefore of order @xmath23 and in this scaling , one can now investigate the limiting statistics of this point process when @xmath24 .",
