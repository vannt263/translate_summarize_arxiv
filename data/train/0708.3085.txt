    "clustering of matter is a spectacular example of structure formation in nature . a fascinating example of clustering is provided by granular gases : gases of macroscopic particles that lose kinetic energy in collisions .",
    "granular gas is a low - density limit of granular flows @xcite .",
    "the simplest version of the granular gas model assumes a dilute assembly of identical smooth hard spheres ( with diameter @xmath2 and unit mass ) who lose energy at binary collisions in such a way that the normal component of the relative velocity of the colliding particles gets reduced by a constant factor @xmath3 ( the coefficient of normal restitution ) upon each collision . granular gases exhibit various pattern forming instabilities , including the shearing / clustering instability of a freely cooling homogeneous inelastic gas @xcite .",
    "this instability causes the generation of a macroscopic flow , both solenoidal and potential , and formation of dense clusters of particles .    a natural theoretical description of macroscopic granular flows is provided by the navier - stokes granular hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "although the criteria of its validity are quite restrictive , see below , granular hydrodynamics has a great predictive power , sometimes going far beyond the formal limits of applicability @xcite .",
    "recently , granular hydrodynamics has been applied to a variety of _ non - stationary _ flows of granular gases @xcite .",
    "non - stationary flows provide sharp tests to continuum models of granular flows , especially when the time - dependent solutions of the continuum equations tend to develop finite - time singularities .",
    "examples are provided by the recently predicted finite - time blowup of the gas density in freely cooling granular gases : at zero gravity @xcite ( as described by ideal granular hydrodynamic equations ) , and at finite gravity ( even in the framework of non - ideal granular hydrodynamic equations ) @xcite .",
    "we will assume in this paper that particle collisions are almost elastic , the local gas density ( that we denote by @xmath4 ) is _ much _ smaller than the close - packing density , and the knudsen number is very small : @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the dimension of space , @xmath7 is the mean free path of the particles , and @xmath8 is the characteristic length scale of the hydrodynamic fields . under these assumptions ( the second and third ones need to be verified _ a posteriori _ ) the navier - stokes hydrodynamics provides a quantitatively accurate leading - order theory @xcite .",
    "it was shown @xcite , by using hydrodynamic equations that , for sufficiently large systems , the homogeneous cooling state ( hcs ) of the granular gas becomes unstable with respect to small perturbations .",
    "there are two linearly unstable modes .",
    "the shear mode corresponds to the development of a macroscopic solenoidal flow , while the clustering mode corresponds to the development of a macroscopic potential flow that brings about formation of clusters of particles .",
    "a consistent _ nonlinear _ hydrodynamic theory of the clustering instability has not been available for quite a long time .",
    "solving strongly nonlinear hydrodynamic equations is hard ( even numerically ) , and one looks for additional simplifications . following refs .",
    "@xcite , we will assume throughout this paper that the macroscopic flow ( but not microscopic motion of the particles ! )",
    "is one - dimensional ( 1d ) .",
    "this assumption is natural in the geometry of a narrow channel with perfectly elastic side walls that we adopt here . in a narrow channel both the clustering mode in the transverse directions , and the shear mode",
    "are suppressed ( see refs . for detail ) . as a result ,",
    "the macroscopic flow can depend only on the coordinate along the channel and time , and we can focus on the development of the pure clustering mode as it enters a strongly nonlinear regime .",
    "efrati _ et al . _",
    "@xcite investigated numerically the long - wavelength limit of such a quasi-1d clustering instability . in this limit",
    "the inelastic energy loss of the gas is the fastest process , so the gas pressure rapidly drops to a very small value .",
    "the further dynamics becomes ( almost ) purely inertial which ( almost ) brings about a finite - time blow - up of the velocity gradient and , therefore , of the density @xcite .",
    "the signatures of this finite - time singularity were indeed observed in the numerical solution of the hydrodynamic equations @xcite until the growing gas density became so high that the numerical scheme lost accuracy .",
    "the numerical results of ref .",
    "@xcite were tested in molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations @xcite .",
    "the md simulations supported the free - flow blow - up scenario until the time when the gas density approached the hexagonal close - packing value , and the further density growth stopped .    recently , fouxon et al .",
    "@xcite analyzed , analytically and numerically , the one dimensional flow in the framework of equations of _ ideal _ hydrodynamics ( that is , neglecting the heat diffusion and viscosity effects ) .",
    "they derived a family of exact solutions to these equations , with and without shocks , for which an initially smooth flow develops a finite - time density blowup .",
    "close to the blow - up time @xmath9 , the maximum density exhibits a power law behavior @xmath10 .",
    "the velocity gradient blows up as @xmath11 , whereas the velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp , rather than a shock discontinuity , at the singularity .",
    "the gas temperature vanishes at the singularity , but the pressure remains finite .",
    "extensive numerical simulations with the ideal hydrodynamic equations showed that the singularity exhibited by the exact solutions is universal , as it develops for generic initial conditions .",
    "very recently , the existence of the attempted blowup regime has been proved in molecular dynamic simulations of a gas of nearly elastically colliding hard disks in a channel geometry @xcite .",
    "the results of refs .",
    "@xcite also imply that , for long wavelength initial conditions , the free flow regime may not hold all the way to the density blowup @xcite .",
    "very close to the attempted free - flow singularity , compressional heating starts to act . as a result",
    ", the gas pressure again becomes important and changes the local blowup properties .",
    "a crucial feature of the finite - time singularity of the ideal hydrodynamic equations is that it obeys an isobaric scenario : the ( finite ) gas pressure becomes uniform in space in a close vicinity of the developing singularity @xcite .",
    "this hints at the possibility of an additional simplification of the problem .",
    "indeed , an ( almost ) homogeneous pressure in a gas implies a low mach number flow , when the inertial terms in the momentum equation are small compared to the pressure gradient term .",
    "this regime appears when the sound travel time through the system is very short compared with other time scales of the problem , and one is interested in the dynamics of the system at the long time scales @xcite . in particular",
    ", this regime appears naturally in the linear theory of the clustering instability of the hcs for intermediate wavelengths of the perturbations , see below .",
    "it is this ( almost ) spatially independent pressure regime that we will be considering in the present work .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ hydro ]",
    "we start with a full set of equations of granular hydrodynamic for a dilute granular flow in a channel and reduce them , for sufficiently short channels , to the low mach number flow equations . in section [ lagrange ]",
    "we employ lagrangian coordinates which enable us to exactly reduce the low mach number flow equations to a single nonlinear and nonlocal equation , of a reaction - diffusion type , for the square root of the inverse gas density .",
    "the new equation is tested in section [ tests ] on two simple problems : the hcs and the linear theory of clustering instability in short channels . in section [ blowup ]",
    "we show that , when the heat diffusion is neglected , the new equation becomes exactly soluble , and the solution develops a finite - time density blowup with the same universal features at singularity as those exhibited by the family of exact solutions of the full set of ideal granular hydrodynamic equations @xcite .",
    "section [ arrest ] presents an analytical and numerical analysis that shows that the heat diffusion term , no matter how small in the beginning , becomes important near the attempted density blowup . as a result",
    ", the density blowup is arrested , and a novel , inhomogeneous cooling state ( ics ) of the gas emerges , with a time - independent inhomogeneous density profile .",
    "importantly , the icss represent _ exact _ solutions of hydrodynamic equations . a limiting form of the novel cooling state is what we call the  hole \" , and we investigate its properties and the relaxation dynamics towards it . for sufficiently long channels ( other parameters being fixed ) the cooling dynamics of the system takes the form of a competition between , and  ripening \" of , holes .",
    "therefore , in section [ coarsening ] we investigate the dynamics and statistics of this competition . in section [ summary ]",
    "we summarize our results and put them into a perspective .",
    "for flows depending on a single spatial coordinate @xmath12 and time @xmath13 the granular hydrodynamic equations can be written as follows : @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the adiabatic index of the gas ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 for @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively ) , @xmath20 $ ] ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , @xmath21 is the gamma - function , and @xmath22 is the dimension of space , so that @xmath18 corresponds to disks , and @xmath19 to hard spheres .",

    ", a basic time scale is the characteristic cooling time @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the average gas density ( the total gas mass divided by the volume of the channel ) , and @xmath34 is a characteristic value of the initial pressure .",
    "there are two characteristic length scales related to @xmath9 .",
    "the first is the sound travel distance @xmath35 which is of the order of the distance a sound wave with speed @xmath36 travels during the time @xmath9 .",
    "the quantity @xmath37 is the same as the length scale @xmath38 introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the second characteristic length scale is the heat diffusion length @xmath39 which , up to a numerical pre - factor , coincides with the critical length @xmath40 predicted by the linear theory of the clustering instability .",
    "the ratio @xmath41 is of order @xmath42 .",
    "as we have already assumed a strong inequality @xmath43 , this ratio is very large : @xmath44 .",
    "throughout the rest of the paper we will also assume that the channel length @xmath8 is much shorter than the sound travel distance @xmath37 .",
    "this hierarchy of length scales brings about a reduced set of equations , in much the same way as in hydrodynamics of optically thin gases and plasmas that cool by their own radiation @xcite .",
    "note that the length scale separation @xmath45 is equivalent to a time scale separation : the sound travel time through the channel , @xmath46 , is much shorter than the characteristic cooling time @xmath9 . as a result",
    ", sound waves rapidly make the pressure ( almost ) homogeneous throughout the channel .",
    "the subsequent slower evolution of the gas proceeds on the background of an almost homogeneous ( but in general time - dependent ) gas pressure , while typical mach numbers of the flow are much less than unity . in a more formal language",
    ", this reduction of the hydrodynamic equations corresponds to elimination of acoustic modes .",
    "before we perform the reduction procedure , let us introduce rescaled variables .",

    "as we show in section [ coarsening ] , the lifshitz - slyozov - type model does _ not _ agree with numerical simulations that start from _ generic _ initial conditions .",
    "however , if one starts the simulation with an assembly of holes , describable by the ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) , the ansatz continues to hold , and the system approaches the simple scaling regime predicted by the lifshitz - slyozov - type theory .",
    "therefore , we want to pursue the ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) a bit further , as it provides an interesting , though non - generic , characterization of the hole coarsening .",
    "we assume that the limiting distribution ( [ sslimiting ] ) , corresponding to @xmath291 , is selected and use eq .",
    "( [ pressure1 ] ) and the relation @xmath369 to find the corresponding scaling behavior of the gas pressure @xmath86 .",
    "we obtain @xmath370 which yields @xmath371 , where @xmath372 is an effective  initial \" time , and @xmath373 . using eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) , we find the following relation between the original ( physical ) time @xmath13 and the new time @xmath84 : @xmath374 as a result , @xmath375^{\\frac{2\\gamma}{\\gamma+1 } } = \\left(\\frac{t_0}{t}\\right)^{\\frac{2\\gamma}{\\gamma+1}}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath376 . now ,",
    "in the low mach number regime we have been dealing with throughout this paper , the total energy of the gas decays in ( almost ) the same way as the pressure , so @xmath377 .",
    "we obtain @xmath378 and @xmath379 in 2d ( disks ) and 3d ( spheres ) , respectively .",
    "again , the cooling dynamics proceeds slower than that predicted by haff s law ( [ haff ] ) .",
    "we checked that the same conclusion holds for any @xmath347 , that is for all possible self - similar distributions of the hole amplitudes .",

    "<S> we employ hydrodynamic equations to investigate non - stationary channel flows of freely cooling dilute gases of hard and smooth spheres with nearly elastic particle collisions . </S>",

    "<S> the gas pressure rapidly becomes almost homogeneous , while the typical mach number of the flow drops well below unity . </S>",
    "<S> eliminating the acoustic modes and employing lagrangian coordinates , we reduce the hydrodynamic equations to a single nonlinear and nonlocal equation of a reaction - diffusion type . </S>",
    "<S> this equation describes a broad class of channel flows and , in particular , can follow the development of the clustering instability from a weakly perturbed homogeneous cooling state to strongly nonlinear states . if the heat diffusion is neglected , the reduced equation becomes exactly soluble , and the solution develops a finite - time density blowup . </S>",
    "<S> the blowup has the same local features at singularity as those exhibited by the recently found family of exact solutions of the full set of ideal hydrodynamic equations ( fouxon _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ 2007 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the heat diffusion , however , always becomes important near the attempted singularity . </S>",
    "<S> it arrests the density blowup and brings about novel inhomogeneous cooling states ( icss ) of the gas , where the pressure continues to decay with time , while the density profile becomes time - independent . </S>",
    "<S> the icss represent exact solutions of the full set of granular hydrodynamic equations . </S>",
    "<S> both the density profile of an ics , and the characteristic relaxation time towards it are determined by a single dimensionless parameter @xmath0 that describes the relative role of the inelastic energy loss and heat diffusion . at @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> the intermediate cooling dynamics proceeds as a competition between  holes \" : low - density regions of the gas . </S>",
    "<S> this competition resembles ostwald ripening ( only one hole survives at the end ) , and we report a particular regime where the  hole ripening \" statistics exhibits a simple dynamic scaling behavior . </S>"
