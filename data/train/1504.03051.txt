    "lefschetz fibrations became a central tool in differential geometry and topology following donaldson s insight in the late 1990s @xcite that one can effectively explore the topological aspects of manifolds by studying smooth maps on them which have locally holomorphic character .",
    "since then they have gained a prominent role in symplectic topology , where a striking balance between flexibility and rigidity makes it possible to carry out topological constructions and geometric obstructions at the same time . in dimension @xmath0 , a firmer grasp on the quickly developing theory of lefschetz fibrations is pursued via factorizations in mapping class groups of surfaces @xcite .",
    "our goal is to better understand how surfaces in symplectic @xmath0manifolds arise in this setting .",
    "surfaces in @xmath0manifolds play a crucial role in our exploration of the topology of smooth and symplectic @xmath0manifolds ; they help determining the homeomorphism type , and distinguishing the diffeomorphism type .",
    "as observed by donaldson and smith @xcite , any symplectic surface can be seen as a _",
    "multisection _ or an _ @xmath1section _ of a lefschetz fibration , which is a branched surface intersecting all the fibers positively @xmath1 times . in @xcite , we initiated an extensive study of symplectic surfaces via factorizations in more elaborate mapping class groups of surfaces .",
    "the current article aims to add to this effort by refining and exploring the correspondence between symplectic surfaces in symplectic @xmath0manifolds , multisections of lefschetz fibrations , and positive factorizations in surface mapping class groups .",
    "an isomorphism between two lefschetz fibrations @xmath2 with @xmath1sections @xmath3 , @xmath4 , is given by a pair of orientation - preserving diffeomorphisms between the total spaces @xmath5 and the base @xmath6spheres , which commute with @xmath7 and match @xmath3 .",
    "the mapping class group @xmath8 , which consists of orientation - preserving self - diffeomorphisms of the genus-@xmath9 surface @xmath10 preserving the set of marked points @xmath11 , is the host to the lift of any monodromy factorization of @xmath2 prescribed by an @xmath1section @xmath3 .",
    "there are simple modifications of monodromy factorizations that naturally arise from a few choices made in the process of extracting these factorizations from a given fibration which we describe and study in detail in the later sections .",
    "two monodromy factorizations in @xmath8 will be called hurwitz equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by applying a sequence of this finite set of simple modifications .",
    "our main theorem in this article is the following :    [ mainthm ] for @xmath12 there exists a one - to - one correspondence @xmath13    when @xmath14 and @xmath15 , i.e. when the multisections are omitted , the above result is classical , due to kas @xcite and matsumoto @xcite .",
    "theorem  [ mainthm ] is proved in section  [ sec : equivalence ] , after a review of background results in section  [ s : factorization multisection ] .",
    "we also provide an extension of this correspondence to one between _ framed _ multisections of lefschetz fibrations and monodromy factorizations in framed mapping class groups introduced in @xcite . in turn , through their monodromy factorizations , we obtain a full characterization of lefschetz _ pencils _ , up to isomorphisms that can permute base points ; see corollary  [ t : equivalence pencils ] .    in the last section , we turn to an intriguing question regarding the diversity of lefschetz fibrations versus that of pencils , which allows us to demonstrate how geometric , topological , and algebraic aspects of the theory of lefschetz fibrations can be nicely brought together . in @xcite , stipsicz asked whether every lefschetz fibration can be obtained as fiber sums of blown - up pencils ; that is to say , whether lefschetz pencils are the building blocks of all lefschetz fibrations via blow - ups and fiber sums . in section  [ stipsicz ]",
    ", we will illustrate a way to produce counter - examples , using the well - known @xmath16chain relation in the mapping class group of a genus@xmath6 surface , along with monodromy modifications involving multisections , and a variety of geometric and topological results packaged in a recipe from @xcite we will be following here .",
    "we moreover show by appealing to above hurwitz equivalences that the only other counter - example we know of , a genus@xmath6 lefschetz fibration of auroux ( shown to be a counter - example by sato in @xcite ) , can also be derived from the same scheme .",
