    "last year , with bering we proposed  @xcite a new method to digitize the sum of planar diagrams selected by t hooft s @xmath6 limit of @xmath7 gauge theories  @xcite .",
    "the proposal , based on the light - cone or infinite momentum frame description of the dynamics , involved discretization of both the @xmath2 carried by each line of the diagram and the propagation time @xmath8 , as in  @xcite .",
    "but the main advantage of the new version was a coherent prescription for resolving most of the ambiguities due to @xmath9 divergences that typically plague the light - cone description .",
    "we hope that our formalism will eventually allow an improved understanding of qcd in 4 dimensional space - time .",
    "but in this article , we merely wish to test the proposal in the context of the well - understood case of large @xmath0 gauge theories in two space - time dimensions , namely the t hooft model  @xcite .",
    "our purpose is not to unearth new aspects of the model , but rather to see how its well known properties can be obtained from our new discretization .",
    "the physical content of the t hooft model boils down to an integral equation , essentially a bethe - salpeter equation  @xcite , that determines the mass spectrum of @xmath10 mesons .",
    "the reason the limit @xmath6 reduces to ladder diagrams ( albeit with self - energy corrected quark propagators ) , is that the 2 dimensional gluon is not dynamical ( there are no transverse polarizations ) .",
    "thus , as with any axial gauge , the light - cone gauge @xmath11 eliminates all gluon self - interactions , so @xmath12 can be integrated out inducing an instantaneous coulomb potential .",
    "but the t hooft limit @xmath6 further eliminates all quark loops and all non - planar diagrams , leaving only the planar self energy corrections to the quark propagator , and the ladder bare gluon exchanges ( coulomb interaction ) between quark anti - quark lines in the singlet @xmath10 channel . in light - cone parameters the bethe - salpeter equation summing these ladder @xmath10 diagrams simplifies to the single variable t hooft integral equation  @xcite . @xmath13 where the integral is understood to be evaluated by the principal value prescription .",
    "the variable @xmath14 is the fraction carried by the quark of the total @xmath15 of the system ( the anti - quark carries @xmath15 fraction @xmath16 ) .",
    "also @xmath17 is the mass of the meson bound state and @xmath18 satisfies the boundary conditions , @xmath19 .",
    "since the new formalism discretizes @xmath20 in addition to @xmath21 , the corresponding simplifications lead to an equation that is not a straightforward discretization of this integral equation .",
    "in particular , the continuum limit can be taken in different ways depending on the ratio @xmath22 ( which would be infinite for continuous @xmath23 ) , and we want to explore to what extent these different continuum limits lead to the same physics",
    ". we shall find that some care must be taken with the setup of the discrete @xmath23 dynamics in order for this to be true . indeed",
    ", a numerical study shows that the most simple - minded treatment leads to a ground state that becomes unstable at moderate t hooft coupling even with relatively small @xmath24 unless the ratio @xmath25 is tuned to be sufficiently small ( perhaps infinitesimal for large @xmath26 ) .",
    "if this feature were robust , it would cast doubt on any potential utility of the discretization of @xmath23 .    to overcome this difficulty",
    ", we find it necessary to veto some of the `` densest '' discretized feynman diagrams : a quark must be forbidden to emit 2 gluons at immediately successive time steps , with a similar veto on two successive absorptions . with this simple veto ( which is prescribed locally in time ) , we shall show that the continuum limit reduces to the t hooft model provided only that the total @xmath15 of the @xmath10 system is large compared to the discretization unit @xmath27 . in particular it is not necessary that the ratio @xmath22 be large .",
    "keeping @xmath28 finite in the continuum limit leads to the t hooft equation with a non - trivial renormalization of the coupling . because of this effect",
    ", it turns out that the effective ( renormalized ) coupling is small for both large and small bare coupling , reminiscent of strong / weak coupling duality .",
    "the strong coupling limit favors the densest diagrams , so vetoing some of the densest ones has a dramatic effect on the strong coupling behavior of the theory .",
    "this possibility was anticipated and discussed in  @xcite in connection with the nature of the fishnet diagrams in higher dimensional space - time .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we set up the discretized t hooft model .",
    "we analyze it using a single time - step transfer matrix in section 3 and using a bethe - salpeter approach in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we discuss and implement the veto which allows a satisfactory continuum limit at fixed @xmath28 .",
    "discussion and concluding remarks are the subject of the final section . 0",
    "the lagrange density for @xmath7 gauge fields coupled to quarks in the fundamental representation is given by @xmath29q,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "we remind the reader that the normalization of gauge fields appropriate for matrix fields and dictated by the gluon kinetic term differs by a factor @xmath31 from the more standard one : @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "thus @xmath34 , and we conclude that @xmath35 . in 2 space - time dimensions",
    "we choose the representation of @xmath36 matrices for which the light - like components are @xmath37 with this choice the field equation for the upper component of the quark spinor does not involve the `` time '' derivative and is an equation of constraint relating the upper component , @xmath38 , to the lower component , @xmath39 . working in light - cone gauge ( @xmath40 )",
    ", we can eliminate the upper component in favor of the lower component yielding the light - cone gauge lagrange density @xmath41\\psi,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 .",
    "our discretization of feynman diagrams is based on the @xmath5 representation of each bare propagator @xmath43 performing the @xmath44 integral gives the following feynman rules for the continuum theory @xmath45 where the arrows indicate the rules to use with imaginary time .",
    "one way to digitize the t hooft equation ( [ thoofteq ] ) is to put the variables @xmath46 on a grid , which amounts to discrete light - cone quantization  @xcite , where one discretizes the amount of @xmath15 each line of the ladder diagram carries in quanta of @xmath27 @xmath47 one can then focus on a state of the system of interest ( in our case a @xmath10 system ) with total @xmath48 .",
    "the continuum theory is recovered by taking the combined limits @xmath49 and @xmath50 while keeping @xmath48 fixed . following  @xcite ,",
    "in addition to discretizing the @xmath2 of each particle , we also discretize imaginary light - cone time , @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "this discretization ( which also serves as an ultraviolet cutoff ) allows the continuum limit to be reached by keeping @xmath53 fixed and taking both @xmath54 and @xmath50 simultaneously .",
    "actually , since the physics of the discretized model depends only on the ratio @xmath55 , the continuum limit is nothing but the large @xmath26 limit , where @xmath26 measures the total @xmath15 of the system state . the conventional continuous time dlcq approach ( see  @xcite and references therein ) corresponds to the special case @xmath56 .",
    "discretization of the quark propagator poses no difficulty .",
    "however , for the instantaneous interaction induced by integrating out @xmath12 , we allow for ambiguities as in  @xcite .",
    "the only constraint is that the discretized propagator become that of eq .",
    "[ continuumrules ] in the continuum limit .",
    "this allows us to spread out the instantaneous interaction away from @xmath57 ( see  @xcite for further discussion ) .",
    "thus the gauge propagator can be expressed as @xmath58 we require that these arbitrary parameters @xmath59 rapidly vanish with increasing @xmath60 . using this discretization ,",
    "the feynman rules for the discrete theory are summarized in fig .",
    "[ feynmanrules1 ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     these results provide numerical evidence that for @xmath61 , the 1st and 2nd excited states do have a nonzero meson mass ( i.e. the leading behavior is @xmath62 ) .",
    "however , the leading behavior for the ground state decreases more rapidly than @xmath62 and is consistent with zero meson mass .",
    "we next address the issue of slow convergence for @xmath61 by examining the form of the ground energy eigenvector for increasing values of @xmath26 .",
    "it is well known that the solutions of eq .",
    "[ thoofteq ] for @xmath63 do not vanish at the endpoints @xmath64 ; indeed the exact ground state is simply a constant . as we can see in fig .",
    "[ eigenvectors ] , at finite large @xmath26 the ground state solution of our discretized equation is ever smaller at the endpoints , and the progression of shapes is toward a more square profile .",
    "but even for @xmath65 the eigenvector has not yet converged to its limiting form .",
    "this should be compared with the solution for @xmath66 which rapidly approaches it s limiting form ( see r.h.s . of fig .",
    "[ eigenvectors ] ) .",
    "we see that , for our discretized equation , the solution for the ground state decreases more rapidly near the endpoints ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) as @xmath26 increases , consistently with the shape eventually approaching a square profile at @xmath50 . however , it is not hard to show that consistency of the continuum limit requires that the range in @xmath14 over which the fall - off occurs must decrease less rapidly than @xmath69 .",
    "this still allows an approach to a square profile but convergence is necessarily slower than one might have expected .",
    "in fact all solutions of the continuum t hooft equation with @xmath61 have non - zero values at the end points . thus we should expect slow convergence for all solutions of the @xmath70 equation because the discrete solution tends to vanish at the endpoints but the limiting form does not .",
    "this effect does not occur for @xmath71 because then the continuum solution vanishes at the endpoints , so a decent approximation to it can be achieved with relatively smaller @xmath26 .",
    "in this paper we have explored the efficacy of the discretization of large @xmath0 qcd proposed in  @xcite by applying it to the well - understood t  hooft model . for a smooth continuum limit over the whole range of bare coupling @xmath72",
    ", we had to introduce a refinement of the discrete time gluon emission vertex .",
    "this amounted to insisting that after an emission , at least 2 time steps had to intervene before the next emission , with a similar restriction on consecutive absorptions .",
    "in contrast , an absorption is allowed to immediately follow an emission and _ vice versa_. with this refinement in place we found that the continuum t  hooft equation describes the mass spectrum for all real @xmath72 . however , the parameters that occur in the equation are renormalized from their bare values , as summarized in eqs",
    ".  [ ukappaeta ] ,  [ effcoupling ] ,  [ effmass ] .    an amusing outcome of this renormalization phenomenon is that the effective coupling goes to zero in both the small and large @xmath72 limits .",
    "perhaps this feature is a version of weak / strong coupling duality , much celebrated in recent developments in string / m theory .",
    "however , we must concede that 2 dimensional qcd may be too trivial to expect anything other than the usual continuum theory to emerge from any continuum limit .",
    "another caveat against attributing much significance to this `` duality '' phenomenon , is that the physics of the continuum limit really only depends on the ratio @xmath73 .",
    "this is because one can always choose the effective coupling as the fundamental unit of energy .",
    "then the theories at different coupling but with the same value of this ratio ( 0 for example ) are physically identical : any differences in description can be removed by a change of units .    at any rate , we conclude that the discretization of  @xcite can be meaningfully applied to qcd in 2 space - time dimensions , with some intriguing hints about the nature of weak / strong coupling duality .",
    "an obvious and important limitation of the 2 dimensional case , however , is that the gluon has no dynamical degrees of freedom .",
    "thus there is no opportunity for the @xmath15 of the system to be shared amongst an infinite number of gluons .",
    "this must occur for the fishnet diagrams to be relevant , and is allowed in higher dimensional space - time .",
    "the next step is to study the three dimensional case , the simplest gauge theory where fishnet diagrams can be relevant ."
