    "the well - studied correlations between supermassive black hole ( smbh ) mass and properties of the host galaxy bulge ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicate that smbh growth may be intimately tied to galaxy evolution .",
    "however the causal physics behind the smbh - galaxy link remains mysterious .",
    "theoretical simulations suggest that rapidly accreting smbhs in the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) phase correspond to periods of recent massive star formation in their host galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "powerful agns may also cause `` feedback '' on their host galaxies , shutting down star formation by blowing out the star - forming gas either via radiative winds @xcite or radio jets @xcite .",
    "observational evidence for star formation or feedback coevolving with black hole growth can be found in the star formation histories of agn host galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    of particular interest",
    "are the hosts of the most luminous agns , which are readily identified by broad emission lines in their optical spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these broad - line agns rapidly accrete material at rates of 1% to 100% of the eddington limit @xcite , and so require plentiful gas in their hosts , with the possibility of accompanying star formation activity .",
    "there is also evidence that broad - line agns universally have high velocity optical and x - ray outflows @xcite , indicative of powerful winds and the potential for effective feedback in shutting down star formation .",
    "studying the mass and rest - frame color of the host galaxy can reveal its recent star formation history : at a given stellar mass , galaxies that are very blue in rest - frame @xmath2 have recently experienced a great deal of star formation , while red galaxies are quiescent and dominated by old stars .",
    "however the brightness of many broad - line agns complicates observations of their host galaxies , since the agn often outshines the galaxy s starlight .",
    "most authors simply avoid the problem of agn contamination by studying host - dominated agn .",
    "`` host - dominated '' means that the accreting black hole is either obscured or weakly accreting ( eddington ratios of @xmath31% ) , and the photometry is dominated by the host galaxy .",
    "studies of such host - dominated agns suggest a preference for massive ( @xmath4 ) host galaxies @xcite , although @xcite suggest this is a relic of selection effects and agns are instead equally likely to be in hosts of any stellar mass .",
    "several observations suggest that host - dominated agns are most often found in `` green valley '' galaxies , so - called because they have colors intermediate between the more densely populated star - forming blue cloud and the passive red sequence of galaxies @xcite .",
    "other studies , however , argue that active galaxies have the same color distribution as inactive galaxies of similar mass and the apparent green valley peak for agn hosts is caused only because agns prefer massive galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite additionally argue that the apparent green valley hosts of agns are just dust - reddened star - forming ( and intrinsically blue ) galaxies , and dust - corrected agn hosts have the same color distribution as inactive galaxies .",
    "besides the difficulties in the differing interpretations , the above studies include only obscured or weakly accreting agns with very different fueling and outflow properties from luminous broad - line agns @xcite . by definition ,",
    "host - dominated agns do not dominate the energetics of their hosts , and probably have minimal influence on the current star formation in their galaxies .",
    "studying the impact of agns on galaxy evolution requires observing galaxies during the most rapid period of smbh growth",
    ".    studies of broad - line agn host galaxies have generally used structural decomposition of high spatial resolution _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) images ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "by modeling the luminous point - source agn and subtracting it from the extended host galaxy light , the intrinsic galaxy properties can be disentangled from the contaminating agn .",
    "the first high - resolution studies of quasar hosts suggested that these luminous agns prefer massive and luminous hosts @xcite .",
    "the host galaxies of luminous agns were also found to have younger stellar populations than inactive galaxies of the same mass , with colors spanning the blue cloud and green valley @xcite . however",
    "the need for high - resolution _ hst _ imaging limited these studies to small numbers ( @xmath520 ) of agns .",

    "are described in section 2 .",
    "our agn / host decomposition method is described in section 3 , which introduces a novel aperture photometry method for separating point - source agns and extended inactive galaxies .",
    "section 4 reveals that broad - line agns have a strong preference for star - forming galaxies , and demonstrates that this preference is not a function of selection effects .",
    "we discuss what these results mean for the relationship between nuclear activity and star formation , and the efficacy of agn feedback , in section 5 .    throughout this work",

    "preference for broad - line agns could be a selection bias , such that a point source is biasing the axis ratio measurement .",

    "the luminous sample probes the full redshift range of the sample , and includes 769 broad - line agns and 110,670 inactive galaxies . *",
    "faint sample : this is limited to all @xmath23 sources with @xmath24 , which similarly corresponds to the @xmath17 limit at @xmath25 .",

    "note that galaxies in the faint sample with @xmath21 are also in the luminous sample , and there are a total of 820 unique broad - line agns in the two samples .",
    "the sdss provides magnitudes in five @xmath26 filters for all broad - line agns and inactive galaxies .",
    "we use both the total magnitude @xmath27 integrated across the entire galaxy is the sdss `` model magnitude . ''",
    "these magnitudes are computed over the same aperture in all five filters , with the aperture size computed from the model fit to the @xmath13 band . ] , and the inner aperture magnitude @xmath28 measured within a 3  diameter of the galaxy center is measured from the same photometric image as @xmath27 . ] .",
    "an outer aperture magnitude @xmath29 is calculated from the light outside the 3  diameter , given by @xmath30 note that @xmath28 is calculated after convolving the image to 2 , which ensures uniform seeing for all objects .",
    "while convolving to lower resolution slightly worsens agn contamination , it actually helps our agn / galaxy decomposition by ensuring that all active galaxies have the same 2  resolution as the point - source stars and inactive galaxies used to calibrate the method .",
    "we k - correct the observed photometry in both samples to the @xmath25 frame using the public kcorrect idl software @xcite .",

    "naively one might assume that the outer magnitudes do not contain any light from the agn point source .",
    "however both figures show that many broad - line agns have brighter and bluer outer magnitudes than the inactive galaxy population .",
    "light from the sdss point spread function ( psf ) extends beyond the inner 3aperture , and a more sophisticated process is necessary to recover the uncontaminated galaxy properties .",

    "galaxy stellar masses come from the mpa - jhu value - added catalog , derived according to @xcite .",
    "derived masses for the inactive galaxies have @xmath34 errors of @xmath50.05  dex , with no error dependence on mass or magnitude .",
    "however most of the broad - line agn hosts are absent from this catalog , and those included in the catalog probably have inaccurate stellar masses due to the agn contamination . to estimate masses for agn hosts , we first calculate the mass - to - light ratios of inactive galaxies as a function of color and luminosity .    figure [ fig : masslight ] shows the median @xmath35-band mass - to - light ratio in bins across the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "we use this figure to estimate masses for broad - line agn hosts , applying the mass - to - light ratio from the bin corresponding to their corrected ( agn - subtracted ) host galaxy color and absolute magnitude .",
    "broad - line agns dominate the light in the inner aperture but also contribute light in the outer aperture ( as shown by figures [ fig : colormag_faint ] and [ fig : colormag_lumin ] ) .",
    "we seek to remove the agn emission to obtain uncontaminated measurements of host galaxy light .",
    "it turns out that inactive galaxies , uncontaminated by agn light , have fairly tight relationships between @xmath1-band concentration and inner and outer magnitudes in each filter : we exploit these relationships to predict the galaxy - only magnitudes of agn hosts . likewise the relationship between inner and outer magnitudes of stars can predict the magnitudes of the agn - only point - source component .",
    "we begin by comparing the inner and outer aperture magnitudes of inactive galaxies and broad - line agns .",
    "figure [ fig : innerouter ] shows inner and outer magnitudes in three different filters ( @xmath36 , @xmath13 , @xmath1 ) and redshift ranges ( @xmath16 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) .",
    "light from broad - line agns has the strongest contaminating effect in blue light and inner magnitudes , but also affects outer magnitudes . for each of the five filters and in ten bins of redshift ( @xmath0 in @xmath39 intervals ) , we find the best - fit line describing outer ( @xmath40 ) and inner magnitude ( @xmath41 ) for inactive galaxies ( shown by the dashed lines for the filters and redshift ranges in figure [ fig : innerouter ] ) .",
    "the offset above this line is defined by : @xmath42    the best - fit line is given by @xmath43 , and broad - line agns typically have @xmath44 .",
    "however even inactive galaxies have a large scatter in @xmath45 , presumably because there is significant structural variation in galaxies of a given outer apparent magnitude . adding a structural measurement could better describe the typical relationship for inner and outer magnitudes in inactive galaxies and explain their scatter about @xmath43 .",
    "in particular we use @xmath1-band concentration , defined as the ratio between the radius containing 90% of the @xmath1-band light and the radius containing 50% of the light , @xmath46 .",
    "figure [ fig : deltamag ] shows @xmath45 from equation [ eq : deltamag ] versus @xmath1-band concentration @xmath47 .",
    "galaxies with @xmath48 ( from fainter inner magnitudes than the average given their outer magnitude ) have low concentration , while galaxies with @xmath44 ( and brighter inner magnitudes ) are more concentrated .",
    "the inactive population shows a tighter relation after using @xmath47 to describe the structural variation , and broad - line agns scatter to brighter inner magnitudes and higher @xmath45 .",
    "a cubic line is fit to the inactive galaxies in figure [ fig : deltamag ] ( shown by the dashed line ) , with the offset from this line given by : @xmath49    figure [ fig : cdeltamag ] shows @xmath50 with @xmath47 for inactive galaxies and agns .",
    "broad - line agn hosts tend to have @xmath51 , as the agn light causes the inner aperture magnitude to be brighter than expected given the galaxy s @xmath1 concentration .",
    "inactive galaxies have @xmath52 with small scatter : the standard deviation is typically only @xmath53  mag , with slightly larger @xmath54  mag scatter for low - concentration ( @xmath55 ) galaxies in the @xmath36 band .",
    "we use @xmath50 as an estimate of the brightness excess in the inner aperture due to agn light .",
    "using equation [ eq : cdeltamag ] for agn / host decomposition has two important assumptions .",
    "first , we assume that @xmath47 is not contaminated by the broad - line agn .",
    "we originally chose @xmath47 with this in mind : @xmath1 band light is the least affected by the ( typically blue ) agn , and @xmath56 and @xmath57 are large radii well beyond the point - source agn .",
    "figure [ fig : agnzconc ] directly tests if the agn affects @xmath47 by plotting agn luminosity against @xmath1-band concentration and comparing the distributions of @xmath47 among broad - line agns and inactive galaxies . in general , both the faint and luminous agn samples span a wide range of concentrations .",
    "however the most luminous ( @xmath58 ) agns are typically more concentrated : this may be evidence that very luminous agns contaminate the concentration measurement , or it may be that more luminous agns prefer more bulge - like hosts @xcite . in case it is the result of a bias , we flag these high - luminosity agns when discussing any connections between agn strength and host galaxy properties",
    ". meanwhile we conclude that our assumption that @xmath47 is unaffected by the agn remains valid for the bulk of broad - line agns with @xmath59 .",
    "the second assumption is that all inactive galaxies have @xmath60 with some random scatter @xmath61 , independent of the presence of an agn .",
    "there is evidence that this scatter is not due to measurement error : as figure [ fig : cdeltavs ] shows , inactive galaxies have values of @xmath50 that are correlated across the @xmath26 filters . in other words , an inactive galaxy with @xmath62 in the @xmath36 band",
    "will also tend to have @xmath63 in @xmath64 .",
    "( this effectively means that the @xmath65 assumption causes a much smaller scatter in color than in luminosity or stellar mass : see section 3.4 . )",
    "we tested if , in addition to @xmath47 , @xmath50 was connected to galaxy properties like color or @xcite index .",
    "however we found no additional correlation and were unable to find the physical basis for the small scatter of inactive galaxies about @xmath65 .",
    "defining @xmath50 using color and srsic index instead of @xmath47 also proved ineffective at reducing the scatter .",
    "instead @xmath61 is treated as a random error , and we investigate its effects in section 3.4 .",
    "inactive galaxies with @xmath66 ( in the upper left of the right panels in figure [ fig : cdeltamag ] ) are potentially interesting because they have similar relationships between inner and outer magnitudes to bright agns .",
    "however after visually inspecting their images and spectra we determined that these galaxies probably have nuclear starbursts and are not some class of misclassified broad - line agns .      most of the light from a point source is detected in the inner aperture , but the psf of the sdss causes light from point sources to `` leak '' into the outer aperture as well .",
    "stars can be used to model the relationship between inner and outer aperture magnitudes for agn - only light ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) , since both are point sources .",
    "we select a sample of 362 stars with @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the brightness ensures their photometry is well - measured , and the color cut makes them similar to the colors of bright agns .",
    "figure [ fig : starinnerouter ] shows the inner and outer magnitudes for the sample of 362 stars .",
    "these point sources have a well - defined relationship between inner and outer aperture magnitude , and the best - fit line in each filter describes the relationship between inner and outer magnitude for the agn - only light : @xmath71 figure [ fig : starinnerouter ] shows that the brightest agns behave like point sources in blue light and lie on this line , while in red light agns behave more like inactive galaxies . because all the images are convolved to 2  before measuring the aperture photometry , @xmath72 in all five filters .      given the derived relationships between inner and outer magnitudes for galaxy - only ( equations [ eq : deltamag ] and [ eq : cdeltamag ] ) and agn - only ( equation [ eq : agnmag ] ) light , we can solve for the unknown quantities @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath41 , and @xmath40 .",
    "first , the total outer and inner magnitudes ( both measured quantities ) are simply the sum of the flux contributions from the agn and the galaxy : @xmath73 @xmath74    the relationship between flux and ab magnitude is defined by @xmath75 .",
    "combining equations [ eq : deltamag ] and [ eq : cdeltamag ] and converting to flux results in : @xmath76 with @xmath77 .",
    "equation [ eq : agnmag ] is similarly converted from magnitude to flux : @xmath78 with @xmath79 .",
    "there are now four equations ( equations [ eq : inner ] , [ eq : outer ] , [ eq : galfl ] , and [ eq : agnfl ] ) that describe the relationships between inner and outer magnitudes for each of the broad - line agn and galaxy contributions .",
    "the quantities @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath47 are measured , and the coefficients @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 come from our line fits in each filter and redshift bin ( with three example filters and redshift bins shown in figures [ fig : innerouter ] , [ fig : deltamag ] , and [ fig : cdeltamag ] ) . solving these four equations for @xmath90 results in :    @xmath91^b      \\label{eq : solution}\\ ] ]    ( with the constants @xmath92 and @xmath93 given in equations [ eq : galfl ] and [ eq : agnfl ] ) .",
    "we numerically solve this equation using a bisector root - finding method .",
    "after solving for @xmath90 , the other three unknowns can be computed from equations [ eq : inner ] , [ eq : outer ] , and [ eq : agnfl ] .",
    "this process is repeated to derive agn - subtracted host galaxy magnitudes in all five bands in each of the ten redshift bins .",
    "table [ tbl : catalog ] shows the corrected magnitudes and derived stellar masses for the 820 broad - line agns in the luminous and faint samples .",
    "it is necessary to ensure that our agn / host decomposition method does not introduce errors which bias the resultant host galaxy colors and stellar masses .",
    "one assumption of our method is that galaxies have @xmath65 : figure [ fig : cdeltamag ] demonstrates that this is true on average , but the @xmath50 values of individual galaxies scatter about this value .",
    "similarly the true inner and outer magnitudes of agn - subtracted host galaxies may have nonzero values of @xmath50 , and our correction to @xmath65 may introduce systematic errors in their resultant colors and masses .",
    "we investigate the errors of the @xmath65 assumption by applying the decomposition method to inactive galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig : galerrors ] shows the changes in @xmath32 color and @xmath94 introduced by `` correcting '' inactive galaxies to @xmath65 .",
    "the dispersions in these shifts represent the errors in color and mass from correcting agn host galaxies with nonzero @xmath50 .",
    "errors in color are small because @xmath95 and @xmath96 are correlated ( see figure [ fig : cdeltavs ] ) .",
    "the dispersion in stellar mass is slightly larger , as indicated by the error bar in the bottom right of each panel , but mass shifts and dispersions are small among blue cloud and green valley galaxies ( the typical hosts of broad - line agns ) . from figure",
    "[ fig : galerrors ] , we do not expect the @xmath65 assumption to bias the observed colors and masses of broad - line agns .    if our other assumption is incorrect and agns contaminate @xmath1-band concentration , this could also introduce significant errors in the agn / host decomposition method .",
    "figure [ fig : agnzconc ] shows that the most luminous agns ( @xmath58 ) may bias @xmath47 , and such systems may have larger systematic or random errors than those estimated in figure [ fig : galerrors ] . for this reason we eliminate the most luminous agns from the discussion and conclusions below .",
    "however the low and moderate luminosity broad - line agns that make up the bulk of our sample do not exhibit biased @xmath47 . for these objects",
    "the assumption that agns do not affect @xmath1-band concentration is unlikely to cause errors in the agn / host decomposition .",
    "the corrected galaxy - only photometry of the broad - line agns can be used to determine if certain types of host galaxies are more likely to exhibit broad - line agns . after computing the agn - subtracted photometry , we k - correct to @xmath25 and",
    "infer the host galaxy stellar mass using figure [ fig : masslight ] .",
    "figure [ fig : cmdfaint ] shows total @xmath32 color vs. luminosity and stellar mass for broad - line agns in the faint sample , with contours showing the inactive galaxies for comparison .",
    "figure [ fig : cmdlumin ] similarly shows broad - line agns and inactive galaxies in the luminous sample .",
    "the top panels of each figure show that broad - line agns typically become redder , dimmer , and less massive after recovering the uncontaminated galaxy light .",
    "a few agn hosts become so much redder without the blue point - source agn that their masses increase , due to the higher mass - to - light ratios of similarly red inactive galaxies .",
    "because we independently correct each filter , there are also a few agn hosts that become bluer , presumably because they contain a reddened agn .    to determine if broad - line agns are more likely to occur in certain types of galaxies , we measure the fraction of galaxies containing an agn in bins across the color - mass diagram , as shown in the bottom panels of figures [ fig : cmdfaint ] and [ fig : cmdlumin ] .",
    "bins are tilted ( with slopes of @xmath97 and @xmath98=0.3 $ ] ) to be parallel to the red sequence .",
    "we count the number of broad - line agns with corrected galaxy - only photometry in each bin , then divide by the total number of galaxies ( inactive plus active ) in that bin to determine the agn fraction . table [ tbl : agnfrac ] gives the broad - line agn fraction in each bin of color and mass , as well as the agn fraction over the entire mass slice .    in both samples ,",
    "galaxies on the red sequence are least likely to host a broad - line agn .",
    "instead agns are most likely to be in the bluest host galaxies of a given stellar mass .",
    "we further explore what the preference for star - forming hosts means for the agn - sf connection and agn feedback in section 5 , but first test to ensure that our results are not caused by selection effects .      while broad - line agns are the brightest and most rapidly accreting agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , many of the weakest broad - line agns have significant galaxy contribution to their continua .",
    "dim agns could be more difficult to detect in bright galaxies , with the broad lines diluted by host galaxy starlight .",
    "more distant galaxies also contain more starlight within the 3  spectroscopic fiber aperture and could similarly dilute the broad emission lines of agns .",
    "we test the potential selection bias against dim agns in luminous host galaxies by computing the agn fraction across the color - mass diagram for dim , moderate , and luminous agns , as shown in figure [ fig : cmdqsostr ] .",
    "agn strength is quantified using the agn - only @xmath36-band absolute magnitude , with @xmath99 divisions chosen to put the same number of agns in each set .",
    "agns were drawn from the faint sample because it includes a large range in stellar mass . from figure",
    "[ fig : cmdqsostr ] it is clear that dim agns are not found less frequently in massive , luminous galaxies , and so this potential selection effect does not occur in our sample .",
    "figure [ fig : qsofrac_redshift ] similarly tests the potential selection effect of higher distance biasing against agn identification .",
    "the luminous sample is most appropriate for this test because it includes luminosity - limited agns over the full redshift range @xmath0 .",
    "in addition to measuring the broad - line agn fraction over all galaxies in each redshift bin , a set of `` massive '' galaxies is also defined with @xmath100 .",
    "this mass limit corresponds to the most massive 10% of galaxies along the blue cloud and green valley .    over the limited @xmath0 redshift range of our sample",
    ", there is no evidence for a decline in the fraction of galaxies hosting a broad - line agn at higher distance .",
    "for this reason we do not expect distant galaxies to bias against agn identification through starlight dilution in the spectroscopic aperture .",
    "in this section we discuss the consequences of agn hosts with young stellar populations for the coevolving growth of galaxies and supermassive black holes .",
    "a major finding of this study is that broad - line agns tend to lie in hosts with young stellar populations , and avoid red and quiescent host galaxies .",
    "the simplest explanation for this is if the same gas that fuels rapidly accreting , unobscured nuclear activity also rapidly formed stars in the recent past .",
    "figure [ fig : cmdqsostr ] suggests that the more powerful the broad - line agn , the bluer the host galaxy : more rapidly accreting agns may have more powerful recent star formation in their host galaxy .",
    "once again , this suggests that star formation and nuclear activity are fueled by the same material .",
    "figure [ fig : qsostr ] directly compares the broad - line agn luminosity to the color and stellar mass of the host galaxy .",
    "agn luminosity is quantified by agn - only @xmath101 .",
    "in addition to corrected color and mass for broad - line agn hosts , figure [ fig : qsostr ] also shows the offsets in each of these quantities from inactive galaxies of similar ( within 0.1  dex ) mass or color .",
    "these offsets are useful to remove the degeneracy between a galaxy s mass and its color . for example , the apparent anti - correlation between stellar mass and agn luminosity in panel c is a result of the degeneracy between mass and color . comparing agns and inactive galaxies of similar color , panel d shows no significant trend between stellar mass offset and agn luminosity .",
    "panel b in figure [ fig : qsostr ] shows that more luminous agns have bluer host galaxies in both the luminous and faint samples .",
    "this may represent a physical connection between agn luminosity and the host galaxy s recent star formation history .",
    "agn luminosity probably translates to accretion rate , and so the relationship between agn @xmath101 and host color indicates that agn accretion rate is correlated with the number of recently formed stars .",
    "these observations favor scenarios with similar fuel sources for both star formation and nuclear activity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with little or no time delay between the processes fueling each .",
    "this interpretation is robust even given the limitations of our agn / galaxy decomposition method .",
    "recall the assumption that agn host galaxies have the same light distributions as inactive galaxies ( quantified by @xmath102 ) . given the @xmath103 relation ( e.g.",
    "* ) and requirement of a bulge to host an agn , it is unlikely that broad - line agns have hosts with instrinsic @xmath104 . on the other hand ,",
    "the unusual blue colors of broad - line agn hosts might indicate nuclear starbursts and intrinsic @xmath105 . applying our decomposition method to an agn host with a nuclear starburst",
    "would over - subtract the blue light , resulting in a redder corrected galaxy @xmath32 color . with the presence of a nuclear starburst it is possible that the galaxy colors of agn hosts may be even bluer than we observe .",
    "similarly the connection between agn luminosity and blue host color in figure [ fig : qsostr ] would steepen if these blue hosts contain nuclear starbursts and unusually concentrated blue light .",
    "another potential concern is that the broad - line agn host galaxies appear blue due to extended scattered light from the agn .",
    "@xcite noted that in extreme cases type 2 quasars with @xmath106 have scattered light on @xmath201  kpc scales that dominates over the host galaxy starlight .",
    "measuring extended scattered light for our sample is beyond the scope of this work , given the requirement for long - slit spectropolarimetry on a large number of broad - line agns with varying luminosities .",
    "however we note that our broad - line agns are several ( 4 - 7 ) magnitudes fainter than the @xcite sample , and so we assume the amount of extended scattered light in this work to be neglible .",
    "our large sample of broad - line agns from the sdss shows a strong preference for blue host galaxies .",
    "this matches earlier studies with small broad - line agn samples , which found a similar preference for hosts with young stellar populations @xcite .",
    "the most @xmath107}}$]-luminous narrow - line agns also prefer star - forming host galaxies @xcite .",
    "these classes of luminous agns all represent `` feast mode '' rapid accretion with high eddington ratios ( @xmath108 ) : @xcite estimate that the most @xmath107}}$]-luminous narrow - line agns have @xmath109 , and broad - line agns also have eddington ratios of 1 - 100% @xcite . in future work",
    "we will directly measure and compare @xmath108 in our broad - line agn sample , but for now we simply assume that they are rapidly accreting agns with @xmath110 .",
    "the blue hosts of our broad - line agns are in contrast to the hosts of fainter narrow - line agns , which instead prefer green valley galaxies @xcite or all galaxy types equally @xcite .",
    "the host - dominated agns of these previous studies are , by construction , fainter than broad - line agns , due to either obscuration or lower accretion rates ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "different host galaxies for broad - line agns and weaker host - dominated agns are incompatible with the historical agn unified model @xcite . in its simplest version ,",
    "the unified model uses only geometrical orientation to explain the different observed properties of broad - line and host - dominated agns . both broad - line and host - dominated agns",
    "would then be observed in the same host galaxy types , as has been observed among intermediate - luminosity agns at @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "our observations instead favor agn unified models where broad - line and faint narrow - line agns have physically different accretion properties @xcite .",
    "broad - line agns might be in star - forming galaxies because such galaxies have the most abundant or efficient fuel supply for the smbh , while other galaxy types can fuel only `` famine - mode '' host - dominated agns with low accretion rates @xcite .",
    "@xcite used a large sample of host - dominated agns to show that there may be a minimum stellar mass of @xmath4 required for a galaxy to host an agn . recently",
    ", however , @xcite argued that the apparent preference for massive agn hosts is caused by selection effects , and there is instead a universal eddington - ratio distribution of agns in galaxies of any stellar mass .",
    "figure [ fig : massbins ] shows the percentage of broad - line agns with host stellar mass for both the luminous and faint samples .",
    "given the narrow distribution of high eddington ratios for broad - line agns ( @xmath113 , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our agn sample is complete to @xmath114 @xcite . thus the luminous broad - line agn sample ( also limited by @xmath115 )",
    "provides a direct test of the agn dependence on host stellar mass . after controlling for galaxy color ( right panel of figure [ fig : massbins ] ) , we find a flat agn fraction with stellar mass .",
    "this suggests that there is no stellar mass threshold for broad - line agns , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "theoretical simulations invoke feedback from luminous agns to rapidly quench star formation and transform their host galaxy colors from blue to red @xcite .",
    "several authors have claimed observational evidence for this scenario , with host - dominated agns apparently preferring recently - quenched green valley galaxies @xcite .",
    "since radiative - mode feedback scales with agn strength , the broad - line agns in our sample would be expected to have an even greater effect in quenching star formation .",
    "however , we find precisely the opposite effect : more powerful agns seem to lie in bluer galaxies . if quasar winds cause significant feedback , then their galaxy - wide effects are not visible until after the broad - line agn disappears .",
    "figure [ fig : quenchcartoon ] outlines three scenarios connecting agns and galaxy quenching : scenario a has star formation quenched before the broad - line agn phase , scenario b quenches during the broad - line agn peak , and scenario c has star formation quenched well after the broad - line agn phase . the increase in star formation during the agn peak in all scenarios is motivated by our observed connection between agn luminosity and blue host galaxy color .",
    "the broad - line agn phase occurs only during the most luminous agn activity , which means that our study probes only the region limited by the dashed `` bl agn visible '' lines in each panel .",
    "scenario a is immediately ruled out by the observed absence of broad - line agns among quenched red galaxies .",
    "however our observations can not distinguish between quenching during or after the broad - line agn phase ( scenarios b and c ) .",
    "the broad - line agn lifetime is less than @xmath5100  myr @xcite , which is roughly the same amount of time it takes for galaxy colors to change from blue to green or red after star formation quenches ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "even if quenching occurs during the agn peak , a change in galaxy colors would not be observed until after the broad - line agn fades .",
    "this is evident in the scenario b curve in the right panel of figure [ fig : quenchcartoon ] . so",
    "while our observations exclude agn quenching scenarios that occur before the broad - line agn phase , only observations of fading agns can distinguish between simultaneous or delayed agn quenching .",
    "an aperture photometry method is used to disentangle the light of broad - line agns and their host galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "based on the corrected , host - only photometry , broad - line agns are distributed throughout the blue cloud and green valley but are very rare among red sequence hosts . withing this distribution ,",
    "agn strength is correlated to the youth of the host galaxy stellar population , such that bluer galaxies have more luminous broad - line agns .",
    "this suggests that broad - line agn activity and star formation are closely coeval with little or no delay between the ignition of each .",
    "the host galaxy properties of broad - line agn hosts also suggest that quenching of galactic star formation occurs or becomes visible only after the rapidly accreting smbh phase : quasar winds are either unconnected to quenching , or their effects are apparent only after the broad - line agn phase has ended .",
