    "nanostructured materials have gained much attention for thermoelectric applications , thanks to their ability to effectively suppress phononic thermal conductivity ( ptc )  @xcite .",
    "very low thermal conductivities of thin films  @xcite , nanowires  @xcite and porous materials  @xcite have been recently reported , reaching in some cases a suppression of two orders of magnitude with respect the bulk . however",
    ", understanding these phenomena is difficult , as classical size effects become important and diffusive theories fail when the characteristic material length ( cml ) becomes comparable to the average phonon mean free path ( mfp )  @xcite .",
    "phonon classical size effects have been long modeled by means of the casimir model , that assumes that all phonons scatter diffusely at boundaries  @xcite .",
    "however , to effectively engineer thermal transport in arbitrary shapes and structures , a more accurate model of heat transport through a material is necessary . to this end , many studies employ the boltzmann transport equation ( bte ) to compute phonon transport  @xcite .",
    "the simplest bte model assumes that the phonon group velocities and scattering times are energy independent , _ i.e. _ the medium is `` gray '' .",
    "although this so - called gray model has been useful for understanding trends in thermal transport in many nanostructured materials , it has poor predictive power especially for materials with wide mfp distributions . in some cases the mfp distribution spans several orders of magnitude .",
    "for example in si , although the most commonly used value for the mfp is @xmath0 , it has been predicted that half of the heat is carried by phonons whose mfp is greater than @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "recent studies have addressed this challenge by including the full phonon distribution by successfully solving the frequency - dependent bte ( fd - bte ) for both transient and steady state cases  @xcite . however , despite its high accuracy , the fd - bte suffers two major limitations .",
    "first , it requires knowledge of the actual phonon dispersion curves and the phonon - phonon relaxation times , which are generally unknown for new potential thermoelectric materials .",
    "the second limitation is related to computational efficiency : fd - bte requires the discretization of the dispersion curves and thus dense sampling close to zero group velocity zones .",
    "furthermore , as all polarizations have to be included , it becomes computationally prohibitive for materials with complex unit cells and phononic materials , where phonon dispersion curves have several branches . in this work",
    ", we provide a new form of the steady state bte , with the capability to compute nanoscale heat transport using as input only the bulk mfp distribution , a quantity that can be directly obtained experimentally  @xcite , while retaining the accuracy of the fd - bte .",
    "also , it allows one to include straightforwardly the whole brillouin zone ( bz ) in the calculations , without relying on the isotropic bz approximation , typically used in fd - bte calculations .",
    "in addition , we couple our model , which we refer to as mfp - bte , with the ballistic bte and the fourier model in order to include ballistic and diffusive effects , respectively , in a consistent and seamless manner .",
    "we apply our method to study three dimensional classical size effects in porous si membranes and find good agreement with experiments on mesoscale size pores . as our method",
    "can be applied to any material whose mfp distribution is known , its applicability could enable a substantially broader range of simulations of thermal transport in nanomaterials .",
    "furthermore , in contrast with the fd - bte approach , the mfp - bte method is based on a discretization of the mfps , and as a consequence , the computational time does not increase as the number of the phonon branches increases , enabling efficient simulations of materials with complex unit cells .",
    "in analogy with photon radiation , nanoscale heat transport can be described by an intensity of phonons @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the spatial coordinate , @xmath4 is the direction of phonon transport within a unit solid angle , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the phonon frequency and polarization , respectively , @xmath7 is the magnitude of the phonon group velocity , @xmath8 is the phonon density of states , @xmath9 is the non - equilibrium phonon distribution and @xmath10 is the reduced plank s constant . in its original formulation , the fd - bte describes the intensity of phonon @xmath11 under the relaxation time approximation  @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the scattering time and @xmath14 is an isotropic phonon intensity parametrized by the bose - einstein distribution @xmath15^{-1}$ ] at a given local effective temperature @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "we point out that @xmath16 is not a thermodynamic temperature but rather should be considered as a measure of the average energy of phonons at a given point @xmath3  @xcite . in order to compute the phonon thermal conductivity ( ptc ) , we apply a difference of temperature @xmath17 across a simulation domain with length @xmath18 and calculate the thermal flux from the hot contact to the cold one . the thermal flux @xmath19 is computed by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the angular average over the solid angle @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the frequency cut - off for a given polarization .",
    "in this work , we consider only the steady state bte , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath24 .",
    "the term @xmath25 can be computed by applying the continuity equation for the heat flux , _ i.e. _ @xmath26 to eq .",
    "[ eprt ] , which yields @xmath27 we note that as both @xmath28 and @xmath29 are frequency dependent , knowledge of the phonon dispersion curves and scattering times is required .",
    "in the following , starting from eqs .  [ eprt]-[econs ] we develop a new version of the bte where the only required input is the bulk mfp distribution , given by  @xcite @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the spectral heat capacity ( _ i.e. _ the volumetric heat capacity times the phonon density of states ) and @xmath32 is the mfp . if the applied temperature gradient is small enough to assume that all the materials properties are constant throughout the simulation domain , we can define the variable @xmath33 representing the departure from @xmath34 of the effective temperature @xmath35 associated to a given phonon frequency , polarization and direction , normalized by @xmath17 . for simplicity , in our simulations",

    "for example , if @xmath46 is the periodicity vector , we have @xmath47 it is possible to show that in the case of mfp - bte we simply need to apply @xmath48 .",
    "partially diffusive boundary conditions at a surface with normal @xmath49 can be applied by imposing @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the specular direction related to the surface with normal @xmath49 and @xmath6 is the specularity parameter , which depends on the surface roughness  @xcite .",

    "we note that the physical meaning of @xmath62 is slightly different from the phonon suppression function defined in recently developed mfp distribution measurements techniques  @xcite , where the suppression function refers to the suppression of heat flux due to the finite thermal length induced in the bulk material .      in order to derive the ballistic limit of the mfp - bte",

    "[ mfe ] as the modified fourier equation ( mfe )  @xcite .",
    "the solution of eq .  [ mfpbte ] requires the discretization of the simulation domain into a mesh whose characteristic size should be at least as small as the smallest mfp , making the phonon transport calculation in materials with wide mfp distributions computationally expensive . to solve this numerical issue",

    "[ fig : figure1]-d , the mfp - bte produces the same results as the fd - bte , revealing the equivalence between the two methods .",
