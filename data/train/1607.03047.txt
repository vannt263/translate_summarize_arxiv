    "accretion processes are ubiquitous in astrophysics",
    ". of particular importance in relativistic astrophysics is accretion onto black holes . in general , such processes",
    "are quite complicated and require a numerical treatment ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a recent review ) , but a simple analytical solution , describing the spherically symmetric , radial flow of a low - density fluid onto a non - rotating black hole , was derived in 1952 by hermann bondi @xcite",
    ". both his original solution , which was derived in newtonian gravity , and its relativistic analogues ( see , e.g. , @xcite , as well as appendix g in @xcite for a textbook treatment ) , are commonly referred to as bondi solutions .",
    "other generalizations include considerations of radiative @xcite as well as magnetic @xcite effects .",
    "even though the bondi solutions describe a very special scenario , they play an important role in our understanding of accretion processes . on the one hand , they illustrate some general features of accretion flow in the context of a simple solution ; on the other hand , they provide a powerful test for relativistic hydrodynamics or magnetohydrodynamics codes designed , for example , to simulate more general accretion processes .",
    "it is the latter aspect that we will focus on in this paper .",
    "the bondi solution has been used as a test case for many numerical codes ( see @xcite for some examples ) .",
    "one complication arises from the fact that the bondi solution is usually given in schwarzschild coordinates , which are not well suited for numerical simulations . in numerical codes that assume a fixed spacetime geometry ,",
    "these problems can be solved by using , for example , kerr - schild or ingoing eddington - finkelstein coordinates , which avoid the problems associated with the black - hole event horizon in schwarzschild coordinates . however , in codes that do evolve the spacetime self - consistently with matter sources , even these coordinates are inadequate for dealing with the problems associated with the spacetime singularity .",
    "self - consistent evolutions of black - hole spacetimes , without the assumption of symmetries , became possible with the simulations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the latter two groups adopted a now quite commonly used approach , in which einstein s equations , expressed in the bssn formulation @xcite or some variation , are evolved in so - called moving - puncture coordinates .",
    "these coordinates , which consist of a `` 1+log '' slicing condition for the lapse function @xcite and a `` gamma - driver '' condition for the shift vector @xcite , bring the spatial slices of black holes into a so - called trumpet geometry ( see @xcite , as well as @xcite for a textbook treatment ; a simple analytical example can be found in @xcite ) . summarized briefly , trumpet slices penetrate the event horizon of the black hole smoothly and terminate on a limiting surface of areal radius",
    "greater than zero , thereby shielding the simulation from the effects of the curvature singularity",
    ".    one method of using the bondi solution as a test case for a code that adopts moving - puncture coordinates is to express the initial data in isotropic coordinates on a slice of constant schwarzschild time ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . during the evolution ,",
    "the solution will undergo a coordinate transition and eventually settle down into a trumpet geometry . while workable , this approach has several disadvantages . in particular , because of the coordinate transition",
    ", only gauge - invariant quantities can be compared directly with the analytical bondi solution .",
    "moreover , isotropic coordinates on slices of constant schwarzschild time cover only the exterior of the black hole , so the region near and inside the black hole has to be initialized with artificial data .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that it is easy to transform the bondi solution from schwarzschild coordinates into trumpet coordinates , i.e. , isotropic coordinates in a trumpet geometry .",
    "casting the bondi solution in trumpet coordinates avoids the coordinate transition when the data are evolved using the moving - puncture method , resulting in a time - independent solution .",
    "this implies that all evolved quantities , including those that are gauge - dependent , can be compared directly with the analytical solution . moreover",
    ", the bondi solution in these coordinates extends smoothly into the black - hole interior , eliminating the need to initialize the interior with artificial data .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : review ] we present a brief review of the bondi solution in schwarzschild coordinates .",
    "then , in section [ sec : trans ] , we describe how this solution can be transformed into other coordinate systems and present several numerical examples , demonstrating the usefulness of the transformed bondi solution as a code test .",
    "we conclude with a brief summary in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the relativistic bondi solution is usually expressed in schwarzschild coordinates , in which the line element takes the form @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the mass of the black hole , @xmath2 is the schwarzschild time , and @xmath3 is the schwarzschild , or areal , radius",
    ". a derivation of the bondi solution in these coordinates can be found , for example , in appendix g of @xcite ; here we list only the most important equations .",
    "we consider spherically symmetric , radial fluid flow onto a non - rotating black hole of mass @xmath1",
    ". we will assume the density of the fluid to be sufficiently small such that we can neglect its self - gravity and approximate @xmath1 to remain constant . since the flow is purely radial , we may write the fluid four - velocity as @xmath4 . for convenience ,",
    "we define the inward radial velocity as @xmath5 . since we are considering accretion solutions only , we will have @xmath6 always .",
    "we further assume that the fluid is at rest , @xmath7 , at spatial infinity",
    ". we can derive the relativistic bondi solution from two fundamental equations , namely the law of baryon conservation , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the proper rest - mass density , and the conservation of energy - momentum , @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the stress - energy tensor for a perfect fluid , @xmath12 the total energy density , and @xmath13 the pressure .",
    "evaluating the spatial part of eq .",
    "( [ se_cons ] ) yields the relativistic euler equation , @xmath14 while the time component yields @xmath15 which is the first law of thermodynamics under the condition of constant entropy .",
    "we therefore conclude that the flow must be adiabatic in the absence of shocks .",
    "in addition to eqs .",
    "( [ baryon_cons ] ) and ( [ se_cons ] ) , we adopt a gamma - law equation of state , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the adiabatic index and @xmath18 is the internal energy density . for adiabatic flow , this implies the polytropic relation @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the polytropic constant .",
    "finally , the speed of sound is given by @xmath21    in schwarzschild coordinates , the law of baryon conservation ( [ baryon_cons ] ) and the relativistic euler equation ( [ euler ] ) can be integrated to obtain the accretion rate equation , @xmath22 and the relativistic bernoulli equation , @xmath23 respectively . here and in the following we denote quantities at spatial infinity with a subscript @xmath24 .",
    "in addition , all smooth solutions to the conservation equations ( [ baryon_cons ] ) and ( [ euler ] ) must pass through a critical point at which @xmath25 and @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the critical radius , i.e. , the radius at which the flow passes through the critical point , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the fluid velocity and sound speed at @xmath30 . in the newtonian limit , when @xmath31 , the critical radius coincides with the sonic radius , at which @xmath32 .",

    "we list the values of key fluid parameters for this solution in tab .",
    "once we have chosen our parameter values , we combine the accretion rate equation ( [ acc_rate ] ) and the bernoulli equation ( [ bernoulli ] ) to obtain a nonlinear equation for the rest - mass density @xmath9 only , using the equation of state ( [ eos ] ) and polytropic relation ( [ polytropic ] ) to eliminate dependence on all other fluid variables .",

    "[ fig1 ] highlights one of the main results of this paper , namely that in trumpet geometries all fluid variables extend smoothly into the black - hole interior .",

    "transformation of the bondi solution to such a coordinate system can be performed in two steps .",
    "we first transform to a new time coordinate @xmath55 , which allows for a different slicing of the schwarzschild spacetime , while keeping the schwarzschild radius @xmath3 as our radial coordinate .",

    "this behavior is not surprising , since the bondi solution is only an approximate solution to einstein s equations , i.e. , it neglects the self - gravity of the fluid and the increase of the black - hole mass with accretion .",
    "this approximation does not affect evolutions in the cowling approximation ; for full evolutions , however , it will lead to deviations of the evolved data from the initial data .",
