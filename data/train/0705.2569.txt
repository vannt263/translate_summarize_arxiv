    "miniature patterns of magnetic field sources integrated on planar substrates , ` atom chips ' , are used to manipulate magnetically trapped clouds of ultracold neutral atoms  @xcite .",
    "atom chips based on current - carrying wires are relatively simple and versatile tools , readily used to produce bose - einstein condensates ( bec )  @xcite .",
    "subsequently a wide range of experiments have been performed ; for example , becs can be precisely positioned with atomic conveyer - belt potentials  @xcite and phase - coherent splitting and interference of condensates has been achieved using double - well potentials  @xcite .",
    "atom chips can also incorporate permanent magnetic materials   @xcite , with significant additional advantages over current - carrying wires alone .",
    "specifically , permanent magnet atom chips do not suffer from current noise which is partly responsible for trap loss and heating of atoms near conducting surfaces  @xcite .",
    "they are also well suited for tightly confining trapping potentials without the technical problems associated with high current densities . furthermore , patterned permanent magnetic materials provide greater design freedom , allowing complex magnetic potentials to be realized such as ring - shaped waveguides or large two - dimensional arrays of microtraps  @xcite",
    ".    one obvious drawback of permanent magnets however is the relatively limited degree of dynamic control available over the associated trapping potentials .",
    "the permanent magnetic field is a particular source of difficulty when loading the atom chip . as such",
    ", most permanent magnetic structures rely on current carrying wires to load and to complete the permanent magnetic trapping potential .",
    "analysis is another complication , because standard techniques such as free ballistic expansion are impossible in the permanent magnetic field .",
    "these basic challenges need to be addressed before more sophisticated atom chip designs incorporating permanent magnets can be realized .    in this paper",
    "we describe the loading of ultracold atoms and evaporative cooling used to produce a bec in a fully permanent magnetic microtrap , without additional external control fields .",
    "although the permanent magnetic chip is in principle `` self - biasing '' we use a small field derived from an externally installed permanent magnet to tune the ioffe field of the trap . to load the permanent magnet trap we adiabatically transfer the atoms to the chip surface from a quadrupole magnetic trap by applying a combination of bias magnetic fields . during loading",
    "we apply a radio frequency field to evaporatively cool the cloud .",
    "analysis of the cloud temperature and spectral distribution is then performed using radio frequency spectroscopy  @xcite . this technique is also used to observe the bec transition _ in - situ _ without expansion from the trap .",
    "it is also possible to eject the cloud from the self - biased trap by rapidly switching on uniform magnetic fields to observe the bec transition using conventional absorption imaging .",
    "our atom chip consists of a f - shaped permanent magnet structure ( fig .",
    "[ figstructure ] ) , designed to produce a self - biased ioffe - pritchard microtrap 180  @xmath0 m from the chip surface  @xcite .",
    "it is cut from 40 @xmath0 m thick fept foil by computer numerical controlled ( cnc ) spark erosion and is glued to an aluminium - coated glass substrate .",
    "the magnetization is oriented in - plane along the @xmath1-direction and was measured using superconducting interference devices ( squid ) magnetometry as 430  ka / m . assuming a uniform magnetization , we calculate an anisotropic , harmonic trapping potential with trapping frequencies of @xmath211  khz and @xmath230  hz in the radial and axial directions respectively .",
    "the calculated magnetic field at the trap minimum ( ioffe field ) is 1  g , in the @xmath3-direction .",
    "it was found experimentally that uncompensated stray fields , such as the earth magnetic field in combination with field corrugation caused by the coarseness of the magnetic structure , added field components in the x - direction on the order of 2 gauss .",
    "the design aimed at a rather low ioffe - field to achieve tight radial confinement , making it necessary to tune the ioffe - field to a higher value to avoid field zeros in the trap .",
    "this was done with an externally installed permanent magnet , thus preserving the permanent magnetic nature of the trap .",
    "the permanent magnet was placed on the optical table ( @xmath4  cm below the chip ) , adding a homogeneous field of @xmath5  g in the x - direction .",
    "the trap frequencies in the lowest minimum were then measured to be @xmath25.2  khz radial and @xmath2128  hz axial with a field minimum around 2.7  g. due to the field corrugation , the axial confinement is significantly larger than expected .",
    "we attribute the field corrugation mainly to the rather unsophisticated production of the chip and feel that a more advanced atom chip ( for instance , produced with patterning techniques based on optical lithography ) could be fully self - biased .",
    "we note that in fact it was possible to load a secondary axial minimum of the trap and perform evaporative cooling without the permanent magnet installed , but less efficiently .",
    "m above the surface .",
    "the structure has a thickness of 40 @xmath0 m and an in - plane magnetization of 430 ka / m . ]    the atom chip is mounted upside down in a quartz - cell vacuum chamber ( @xmath6  @xmath7 ) , which is surrounded by three orthogonal coil pairs that can produce magnetic fields @xmath8  g with any desired polarity .",
    "the coils are used to load the atoms into the permanent magnet trap as described below .",
    "the loading procedure ends by ramping the currents to zero and short - circuiting the coils with relays .",
    "the latter significantly reduces the residual magnetic field noise .",
    "additional sources of magnetic field noise , such as the current supplies themselves , were identified and placed @xmath9  m from the experiment .",
    "residual background field noise at 50 hz was further reduced by feeding a phase and amplitude adjusted 50  hz signal derived from the mains to a large coil pair placed around the experiment .",
    "our efforts reduced the root - mean - square magnetic field noise in the @xmath3 direction from more than 20  mg to below 0.5  mg .",
    "radio frequency ( rf ) fields used for forced evaporative cooling and for rf spectroscopy of the atom cloud are produced by a computer controlled 10-bit direct digital synthesis rf generator @xcite ( ad9959 ) with four independent outputs .",
    "we use two outputs connected to separate antennas for evaporative cooling and rf spectroscopy .",

    "the filled trap on the left - hand side is compressed and moved towards the chip while the empty trap is decompressed , moves away from the chip , and disappears when the field is turned to zero ( vi).,width=264 ]    in this section we describe the loading process of the permanent magnetic trap using external uniform bias fields . the possibilities and restrictions for moving magnetic traps by this method have been described in detail in @xcite . efficiently loading atoms into the trap proves to be nontrivial since at the end of the loading procedure",
    "all external fields should be turned off .",
    "the main difficulty arises from the already present field minimum , located close to the chip , containing no atoms at the start of the loading process .",
    "this minimum can act as a leak when the trap containing the atoms is brought too close to it .",
    "we have optimized a particular loading trajectory that avoids this secondary minimum as much as possible .",
    "another important feature is that the magnetic field minimum is kept above zero during the last part of the loading process , making it possible to evaporatively cool during the transfer without significant loss due to majorana spin - flip transitions .",
    "we collect approximately @xmath10 @xmath11rb atoms in a mirror magneto - optical trap ( mot ) .",
    "the mot is made with the help of external field coils , at a distance of 8  mm from the surface where the field of the chip is negligible .",
    "the atomic cloud is then compressed ( cmot ) and optically pumped to the magnetically trappable @xmath12 state .",
    "after switching all laser beams off , the cloud is trapped 8  mm below the chip surface using the quadrupole magnetic field produced by one pair of coils operated in anti - helmholtz configuration .",
    "additional uniform fields can bring this trap closer to the chip . in close proximity to the chip surface the field gradient produced by the f - shaped magnet",
    "is large enough to hold the atoms against gravity and the anti - helmholtz coils can be turned off . at this point two magnetic field minima exist .",
    "a weak trap containing the atoms is produced by the magnet in combination with a uniform bias field and is located far from the chip surface .",
    "a tighter trap close to the chip surface also originates from the magnet and is at this point still vacant .",

    "[ figloadinga ] .",
    "the merging of the two minima is prevented through an additional @xmath16 component of the applied field .",

    "[ figloadingb](ii - vi ) . during this transfer the magnetic field gradient of",
    "the filled trap increases from @xmath14  60  g / cm to @xmath14  6800  g / cm which leads to significant heating of the atom cloud .",
    "although the two field minima do not merge , they pass each other separated by a finite potential barrier of @xmath17 g which allows energetic atoms to spill over to the decompressing trap .",
    "this loss mechanism can take away up to @xmath18 of the magnetically trapped atoms .",
    "however , it has been possible to load @xmath19 atoms into the permanent magnet trap .",
    "a series of absorption images at various detunings are taken during the loading in order to create a series of optical spectra of the trapped cloud and are shown in fig .",

    "evaporative cooling however requires a trap with non - zero minimum to prevent spin - flip loss .",
    "we choose a trajectory that always maintains a non - zero minimum during the final approach of the atomic cloud .",
    "it is non trivial that such a trajectory exists  @xcite .",
    "we have found that the trap turns into a ioffe trap after the turn off of the anti - helmholtz coils and remains a ioffe trap during the rest of the loading process ( steps ii - vi in fig",
    ".  [ figloadingb ] ) .",
    "the preliminary evaporative cooling stage during the transfer consists of a 6  s linear rf ramp from 35  mhz to 8  mhz . at the end of the ramp all externally controlled fields",
    "are turned to zero and the cloud is trapped in the potential produced by the magnetic structures alone .",
    "after loading , the cloud contains approximately @xmath26 atoms at a temperature of @xmath27k yielding a peak phase space density of @xmath28 .",
    "although the number of atoms is relatively small , the high trap frequencies result in a mean collision rate of @xmath29s@xmath30 .",
    "a final rf evaporative cooling stage is performed with a linear rf sweep over 2.3  s from 8  mhz down to @xmath141.9  mhz which lowers the trap depth from 600  @xmath0k to @xmath31k .",
    "the most commonly used diagnostic technique for ultracold atoms is free ballistic expansion followed by absorption imaging . in our case this is not possible due to the permanent character of the magnetization of our chip .",
    "instead , we employ radio frequency spectroscopy to characterize the ultracold atom cloud in the permanent magnetic trap .",
    "this allows us to directly probe the energy distribution of the confined cloud and to extract the cloud temperature without ballistic expansion .",
    "the cloud is probed by applying a radio frequency pulse of frequency @xmath32 for a duration of 0.5  ms .",

    "it took considerable effort in magnetic field noise reduction to obtain the resolution needed to observe the narrow condensation peak .",
    "in addition , it was necessary to maintain the same cycle for the applied magnetic fields throughout the experiment to minimize hysteresis effects in the magnetic material and surrounding structures , which otherwise could lead to variations in the trap bottom of several @xmath54  khz .",

    "each spectrum is averaged 6 times and consists of about 70 data points , spread nonlinearly over the spectral range to emphasize the bimodal nature and condensate peak .",
    "+    as an alternative way to identify the bec transition , we ramp on , over 2  ms , a magnetic field of 50  g , which rapidly transfers the atom cloud 1  mm away from the chip surface . at this position all magnetic fields are suddenly switched off and the acquired kinetic energy of the atoms is sufficient to overcome the remaining potential barrier .",
    "the cloud is accelerated further by gravity and the rapidly decaying field of the chip .",
    "after 3.5  ms an absorption image is taken to reveal a partially expanded atom cloud ( fig .",

    "as the final trap depth is reduced , the atom distribution becomes bimodal with a narrow central peak and a change in aspect ratio .",
    "combining these absorption images with the radio frequency spectra we find the bec transition at a trap depth of about @xmath56k , with 7000 atoms at a temperature of @xmath57k , which is close to the expected value of @xmath58k . continued evaporation results in a nearly pure bec consisting of @xmath59 atoms .",
    "although this ejection method is useful for observing the phase transition to bec it can not be reliably used to obtain temperatures because of the non adiabatic nature of the expansion and the large magnetic field gradients during the expansion .",
    "it can however be used to obtain condensate fractions .",
    "we observe strong heating of the ultracold cloud ( @xmath14  6  @xmath0k / s ) during the final stage of evaporation .",
    "this is likely caused by three - body collisions as the estimated density at the trap center near @xmath37 is quite high , @xmath60  @xmath61 . as a result , the lifetime of the condensate is @xmath14  15  ms without a rf shield and @xmath14  150  ms with a rf shield @xcite .",
    "the quoted density corresponds to a three - body decay rate of @xmath14  3  s@xmath30 @xcite .",
    "it is thus likely that three - body decay limits the final number of condensate atoms during the last evaporation stage .",
    "it is interesting to note that condensation is observed in the expanded cloud at higher evaporation frequencies than in the rf spectra .",
    "we suspect this is because of the long rf probing time necessary to obtain the desired resolution and signal - to - noise ratio , causing considerable heating during the radio frequency pulse .",
    "it is also possible that the signal - to - noise ratio does not allow the observation of small condensate fractions , because it requires the removal of a substantial fraction of atoms .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented solutions to the problems of loading and analysis of an atomic cloud on a fully permanent magnetic chip .",
    "we have demonstrated an efficient loading procedure relying on the adiabatic movement of ioffe traps using uniform external fields , allowing the application of forced evaporative cooling during loading .",
    "after loading , radio frequency spectroscopy is used to characterize the cloud .",
    "a model is derived for fitting rf spectra to obtain cloud temperatures .",
    "the fitted temperatures compare well to temperatures derived from fitting the in - trap axial density distribution .",
    "noise reduction and radio frequency power reduction give the resolution needed to observe the onset of bose - einstein condensation in radio frequency spectra .",
    "this results in bimodal spectra and eventually in a spectrum of a nearly pure condensate .",
