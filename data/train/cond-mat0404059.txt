    "since the seminal work of morin @xcite the metal - insulator transitions of the early transition - metal oxides are motivating ongoing research . in particular , showing first - order transitions with a conductivity change of several orders of magnitude , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are regarded as prototypical materials of this class .",
    "recent theoretical work has revealed a strong influence via electron - phonon coupling of the structural degrees of freedom on the electronic properties of @xmath3 and neighbouring rutile - type dioxides @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the corundum - type sesquioxide has turned out to be subject to strong electronic correlations @xcite , as seems to be the case also for @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the relative importance of these mechanisms as well as their dependence on crystal structure and band filling are still unclear .    in this situation",
    "the magnli phases offer the opportunity of a more comprehensive understanding @xcite .",
    "these phases form a homologous series of the kind @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) and are particularly suited for studying the differences in crystal structures and electronic properties between the end members @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) and @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "this is due to the variation in @xmath12 band occupation across the series as well as the fact that , as the general formula @xmath13 suggests , the crystal structures can be viewed as rutile - type slabs of infinite extension and different thickness , separated by shear planes with a corundum - like atomic arrangement @xcite . while in the rutile - type regions the characteristic metal - oxygen octahedra are coupled via edges , the shear planes have face - sharing octahedra as in the corundum structure .",
    "we have recently started a systematic investigation of the vanadium magnli phases @xcite ; here we report on the first results for the titanium series .",
    "the magnli phase @xmath0 experiences a metal - insulator transition at 154 k , which is followed by an insulator - insulator transition at 130 k with a thermal hysteresis of about 12 k @xcite .",
    "both transitions are first - order @xcite and connected with a conductivity change of three orders of magnitude each @xcite . while a sharp decrease of the magnetic susceptibility has been reported for the 154 k transition , which has been interpreted as a change from pauli paramagnetism to van vleck - like behaviour @xcite , there is no considerable change at lower temperatures @xcite .",
    "in contrast , whereas the transition at 154 k goes along with increase in volume @xcite , a distortion of the crystal structure had been first observed only for the second transition @xcite . from single - crystal x - ray diffraction data taken at 298 , 140 , and 120 k , marezio _ et al .",
    "_  reported differentiation of the ti - o distances on going to the low - temperature phase , suggesting the formation of @xmath14 and @xmath15 sites , which each occupy half of the characteristic four - atom chains and which contrast the average @xmath16 valence observed at high temperatures @xcite .",
    "in addition , the @xmath14 sites form short metal - metal bonds indicating singlet formation and explaining the changes in resistivity and magnetic susceptibility . at the same time",
    "the unpaired @xmath15 and , to a lesser degree , the @xmath14 atoms are displaced perpendicular to the chain axis off the center of the surrounding octahedron towards one of the oxygen atoms @xcite .",
    "this pattern is similar to the situation found for cr - doped @xmath3 , where half of the chains pair and atoms on the remaining chains display a zigzag - like off - center displacement @xcite .",
    "finally , marezio _ et al .",
    "_  reported large thermal displacements for the intermediate phase , suggesting that the structural changes are associated with the metal - insulator transition at 154 k but still lack long - range order @xcite .",
    "the latter sets in at the lower transition , which is thus regarded as a disorder - order transition @xcite as has been confirmed by specific - heat and epr data @xcite .",
    "these results led to interprete the intermediate phase as a bipolaron liquid @xcite . yet , refined determination of the crystal structure revealed a fivefold superstructure for the intermediate phase , which shows the same structural characteristics as the low - temperature phase , and thus questioned understanding the conductivity in terms of independent mobile bipolarons @xcite .",
    "recent photoemission and x - ray absorption measurements showed only minor effects of the insulator - insulator transition on the electronic properties but revealed drastic changes at 154 k @xcite .",
    "the latter include significant down- and upshift of the occupied and unoccupied ti @xmath1 @xmath17 states near the fermi energy .",
    "in contrast , o @xmath18 states extending from @xmath19 to @xmath20ev remain essentially unaffected by the transition .",
    "understanding of the physical properties of the magnli phases is greatly facilitated by an alternative unified representation of their crystal structures @xcite .",
    "it is based on the notion of a hexagonal closed - packed array of oxygen atoms forming a regular 3d network of octahedra .",
    "apart from a slightly different buckling , this network is the same for all magnli phases including the rutile - type dioxide and the corundum - type sesquioxide .",
    "differences between the compounds @xmath6 arise from filling the octahedra with metal atoms .",
    "filled octahedra form chains of length @xmath21 parallel to the pseudorutile @xmath22 axis , followed by @xmath23 empty sites .",
    "while in the rutile structure these chains have infinite length , they comprise just two filled octahedra in the corundum structure , where they are perpendicular to the hexagonal @xmath24 axis . within the crystal ,",
    "the metal chains are arranged in two different types of layers , which are interlaced by oxygen layers and alternate along @xmath25 .",
    "this gives rise to the aforementioned two types of chains , labelled ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "in @xmath0 , they comprise atoms ti1/ti3 and ti2/ti4 , respectively ( see fig .  1 of ref .",
    "@xcite , where this situation has been sketched for the isostructural @xmath26 ) . due to alternation of the layers and relative shifts of the four - atom chains within the layers",
    "the end atoms ti1 and ti2 are found on top of each other ( note that in the notation by marezio and coworkers @xcite the chain center and end atoms are reversed ) . in the sesquioxide ,",
    "these two atoms are usually designated as the @xmath24-axis pair .",
    "while neighbouring octahedra share faces along @xmath25 and @xmath27 , metal - metal bonding along all other directions within the layers is via edges @xcite . as a consequence , the atomic arrangement near the chain ends",
    "is corundum - like , whereas the chain centers correspond to the rutile - type regions . by virtue of the just sketched representation of the crystal structures it is possible to refer the symmetry components of the ti @xmath1 orbitals of all compounds to a common local coordinate system @xcite . in this system",
    "the @xmath28- and @xmath29-axes of the local coordinate system are parallel to the apical axis of the local octahedron and the pseudorutile @xmath22 axis , respectively .    in this letter",
    "we report on electronic structure calculations for the magnli phase @xmath0 using the crystal structures of both the room - temperature and the low - temperature phase .",
    "our calculations reveal i ) rather isotropic occupation of the ti @xmath1 @xmath17 states for the room - temperature structure , ii ) significant electron transfer from one half of the chains to the other in the low - temperature structure , iii ) orbital order at the @xmath30 chains coming with strong metal - metal dimerization , and iv ) strong electron localization , which leads the way to the observed metal - insulator transition .",
    "the calculations were performed using the scalar - relativistic augmented spherical wave ( asw ) method @xcite . in order to represent the correct shape of the crystal potential in the large voids of the open crystal structure , additional augmentation spheres were inserted .",
    "optimal augmentation sphere positions as well as radii of all spheres were automatically generated by the sphere geometry optimization ( sgo ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "self - consistency was achieved by an efficient algorithm for convergence acceleration @xcite .",
    "brillouin zone sampling was done using an increased number of @xmath31-points ranging from 108 to 2048 points within the irreducible wedge .",
    "calculated partial densities of states ( dos ) are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : res1 ] .    here and in",
    "all following figures results for the room - temperature and low - temperature structure are given on the left and right , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ fig : res1 ] , contributions from both the ti @xmath1 and o @xmath18 states are included .",
    "in addition , ti contributions from the ( a ) and ( b ) chains containing ti1/ti3 and ti2/ti4 , respectively , are distinguished . all other orbitals play only a negligible role in the energy interval shown .",
    "two groups of bands are identified , which extend from @xmath32 to @xmath33ev and from @xmath34 to @xmath35ev and comprise 24 and 16 bands , respectively .",
    "they derive mainly from the ti @xmath1 states .",
    "in addition , 42 bands are found in the energy range from @xmath36 to @xmath37ev , which trace back mainly to the o @xmath18 states .",
    "however , @xmath38@xmath12 hybridization causes @xmath12 and @xmath38 contributions , respectively , below and above @xmath39ev reaching about 15% especially in the two upper groups .",
    "crystal field splitting expected from the fact that the ti atoms are located at the centers of slightly distorted octahedra is observed in the ti @xmath1 partial dos . as a detailed analysis of the wave functions reveals , the lower group of ti @xmath1 derived bands arises almost exclusively from states of @xmath17 symmetry .",
    "in contrast , bands between @xmath34 to @xmath35ev trace back to the @xmath40 states .",
    "the energetical separation of the centers of gravity of these two groups of about @xmath41ev compares well with the value of @xmath34ev taken from the xas measurements by abbate _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . at the same time , the calculated position and width of the o @xmath18 dominated group of bands is in very good agreement with the photoemision data of these authors .    in general",
    ", these findings are very similar for the room - temperature and the low - temperature structure .",
    "in particular , the o @xmath18 bands keep their energetical position and band width , again in agreement with the photoemssion data @xcite .",
    "differences show up on closer inspection of the ti @xmath1 dominated states .",
    "most striking are the changes occurring in the occupied part of the ti @xmath1 @xmath17 bands . while for the room - temperature structure the ti @xmath1 partial dos in this energy interval are almost the same for both chains , we observe strong increase and decrease of the ti @xmath1 partial dos arising from the atoms of chain ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively , for the low - temperature structure indicative of a considerable charge transfer .",
    "the integrated difference amounts to @xmath42 electrons per formula unit . at the same time , states in the ti @xmath1 @xmath40 group of bands , i.e.   between @xmath34 and @xmath35ev , experience some rearrangement . in particular , on going from the room - temperature results to those obtained for the low - temperature structure , we find energetical down- and upshift , respectively , of the centers of gravity of these bands for chain ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "both these changes can be attributed to the difference of the average ti - o distances emerging in the low - temperature phase @xcite .",
    "they lead to the assignment of ti @xmath43 and @xmath44 charges contrasting the formal @xmath45 valence of the room - temperature phase @xcite . while in the latter phase the average ti - o bond length is the same for all titanium sites , in the low - temperature phase the average bond length increases and decreases for chain ( a ) and ( b ) atoms , respectively . as a consequence ,",
    "@xmath12 electron charge is transferred from atoms ti2/ti4 to ti1/ti3 , leaving the @xmath12 states in the ( b ) chains unoccupied .",
    "in addition , the shrinking and inflating of the oxygen octahedra strongly affect the bonding - antibonding splitting especially of the @xmath46-bonding states of @xmath40 symmetry .",
    "this splitting decreases / increases in chains ( a)/(b ) , leading to the observed down-/upshift of the ti @xmath1 dominated antibonding states .    in order to investigate the charge redistribution coming with the transitions in more detail we display the ti @xmath1 @xmath17 partial dos of all four titanium atoms separately in figs .",
    "[ fig : res2 ]     +    and [ fig : res3 ] .",
    "+    in doing so we distinguish the three different @xmath12 states contributing to this group of bands using the aforementioned local coordinate system as defined in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this system ,",
    "the @xmath47 states , pointing parallel to the pseudorutile @xmath22 axis , mediate @xmath46-type metal - metal overlap within the chains .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath48 orbitals take part in albeit weaker @xmath46-type @xmath12-@xmath12 overlap across the chains .",
    "weak interchain coupling is also due to overlap of @xmath47 and @xmath49 orbitals of neighbouring chains .    for the high - temperature structure",
    "strong splitting of the @xmath47 states of both ti3 and ti4 is observed .",
    "this is a consequence of the short ti3-ti3 and ti4-ti4 distances in the chain centers causing strong bonding - antibonding splitting of the @xmath47 orbitals of these atoms .",
    "in contrast , distances between the chain center and end atoms are considerably larger , this leading to the somewhat unstructured shape of the @xmath47 partial dos of atoms ti1 and ti2 .",
    "similar shapes are displayed by the @xmath50 partial dos of all atoms due to the very small metal - metal bonding these states take part in .",
    "finally , the @xmath48 states of all atoms show distinct splitting into bonding and antibonding states , reflecting overlap of these orbitals of atoms ti3 and ti4 ( peaks at @xmath51 and @xmath52ev ) as well as atoms ti1 and ti2 . in the latter case overlap is parallel to the pseudorutile @xmath25 axis perpendicular to the chains across octahedral faces .",
    "this bond corresponds to the @xmath24-axis pairs in the sesquioxide .",
    "indeed , the shape of the @xmath48 partial dos with its pronounced antibonding peak at @xmath53ev and the tail of bonding states extending from @xmath54 to @xmath55ev has been also observed for @xmath4 .    on going to the low - temperature phase several striking changes occur .",
    "first , we observe the abovementioned increase and decrease of the partial dos of the ( a ) and ( b ) chain atoms , respectively , in the occupied part of the spectrum , which is a consequence of the charge ordering coming with the increased and reduced average ti - o bond - length as reported by marezio and coworkers @xcite . in the ( b )",
    "chains smaller distances induce a stronger bonding - antibonding splitting of the hybridized ti @xmath1 and o @xmath18 states , hence , upshift of the antibonding @xmath12 dominated bands .",
    "this effect is supported by the displacement of these atoms perpendicular to the chains .",
    "eventually , we witness almost complete depopulation of the ( b ) chain states , i.e.  ti @xmath56 valence .",
    "in contrast , on the ( a ) chains longer ti - o distances lead to reduced bonding - antibonding splitting , hence , energetical lowering of the @xmath12 bands and the occupation reaches nearly @xmath30 .",
    "second , in addition to the charge ordering we find strong changes in the occupation of the single @xmath12 states of the ( a ) chain atoms . due to the albeit small displacement of atoms ti1 and ti3 perpendicular to the chain axis the @xmath49 and @xmath48 states of these atoms are subject to larger @xmath12-@xmath38 hybridization and thus shift to higher energies . in contrast ,",
    "both the ti1 and ti3 @xmath47 partial dos show strong splitting into a double maxima structure with peaks near @xmath57 and @xmath58ev .",
    "this effect results from the dimerization of these two atoms observed below the metal - insulator transition , which leads to metal - metal overlap of the orbitals extending along the ( a ) chains and splitting of the corresponding bands into bonding and antibonding states . at the same , chain ( b )",
    "atoms do not display any splitting of these states due to the uniform distance of more than @xmath59   between all atoms of this chain .",
    "the corresponding changes of the band structure as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : res4 ]    have drastic effects especially near the fermi energy . while in the room - temperature structure bands in the lower part of the @xmath17 group",
    "show strong dispersion leading to the metallic behaviour , the low - temperature structure is characterized by two split - off bands . as expected from the partial dos and as revealed by a detailed analysis of the wave functions , these weakly dispersing bands are almost exclusively of ti1 and ti3 @xmath47 character .",
    "additional bands of the same symmetry , which likewise show a reduced dispersion , are found at the upper edge of the @xmath17 group , supporting the previous interpretation in terms of bonding - antibonding splitting of these states . yet , despite the separation of the lower @xmath47 bands from all higher lying states there is still a semimetal - like overlap of about @xmath60ev , inhibiting the complete opening of the insulating band gap .",
    "in general , the situation resembles very much that found for the rutile - type compounds @xmath61 and @xmath3 , where the metal atoms are found in a @xmath56 and @xmath30 configuration , respectively . while the insulating titanate preserves the rutile structure down to lowest temperatures maintaining especially the equidistant spacing of the metal atoms , vanadium dioxide shows distinct deviations from this structure at the metal - insulator transition . in particular , vanadium atoms experience pairing parallel to the @xmath62 axis as well as zigzag - like antiferroelectric displacements perpendicular to this axis . in the calculation for @xmath3 ,",
    "these changes lead to splitting of the @xmath47 bands as well as energetical upshift of the @xmath49 and @xmath48 states @xcite .",
    "we may thus regard low - temperature @xmath0 as composed of @xmath61- and @xmath3-like chains , which display the same behaviour as the respective dioxide .",
    "common to @xmath3 and @xmath0 is also the finding of a small semimetal - like overlap for the low - temperature phase , which we attribute to the shortcomings of the local density approximation . yet",
    ", this weakness does not undermine the interpretation of the phase transitions of both compounds as arising from orbital order and strong bonding - antibonding splitting of the @xmath47 bands due to the structural changes and strong electron - phonon coupling .",
    "in addition , @xmath0 is characterized by distinct charge ordering , leading to separated @xmath56 and @xmath30 chains and laying ground for the efficacy of the aforementioned mechanisms .",
    "in summary , according to electronic structure calculations for the magnli phase @xmath0 , the metal - insulator transition of this material arises from the complex interplay of different types of ordering phenomena .",
    "while in the room - temperature structure all ti @xmath1 @xmath17 states display uniform occupation , the low - temperature structure is characterized by the formation of two types of titanium chains comprising ti @xmath56 and @xmath30 states , respectively .",
    "this charge ordering is accompanied by orbital ordering on the @xmath30 chains and strong bonding - antibonding splitting of the respective @xmath47 states coming with ti - ti dimerization and zigzag - type antiferroelectric displacement of these atoms in complete accordance with the findings for the @xmath30 dioxide @xmath3 .",
    "finally , like in the latter compound , singlet formation on the @xmath47 states paves the way for the observed insulating behaviour .    to conclude , @xmath0 shares fundamental aspects with other cornerstone materials of condensed matter physics .",
    "the charge ordering occuring at the metal - insulator transition is closely related to that discussed for the verwey transition of @xmath2 .",
    "in contrast , the orbital order and metal - metal dimerization accompanying the phase transition of @xmath0 arise from the same mechanism as that driving the transitions of @xmath3 and @xmath63 , namely instability of the @xmath30 atom chains towards the strong metal - metal bonding along the characteristic chains as well as antiferroelectric displacement perpendicular .",
    "this effect may thus be regarded as a universal mechanism common to many early rutile - type transition - metal compounds .",
    "this work was supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( dfg ) through sonderforschungsbereich sfb 484 ."
