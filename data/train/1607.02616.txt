    "with the first detection of gws we entered a new era in astrophysics @xcite .",
    "electromagnetic counterparts are crucial for establishing the astrophysical context for the gws and also for a more accurate localization to aid subsequent follow - up @xcite .",
    "grb progenitors ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews ) have been leading candidates for sources of gws @xcite .",
    "the most widely considered gw sources are compact binary mergers with components stemming from a combination of neutron stars ( ns ) or black holes ( bh ) .",
    "other than bh - bh mergers , substantial radiation is expected to accompany the gw signal , and indeed , the leading candidate for short - hard grbs are merging neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the gw  150914 event is best explained by the merger of two @xmath330 m@xmath4 black holes .",
    "_ fermi_/gbm detected a tantalizing counterpart , gw  150914-gbm @xcite , consistent with a weak short grb , broadly consistent with the gw location and temporally coincident with the gw signal ( offset of @xmath5=0.4 s ) .",
    "we note however that while advanced ligo and gbm locations are consistent , they both span a significant portion of the sky ( @xmath3600 square degrees for advanced ligo at 90% confidence level and @xmath33000 square degrees for gbm at 68% confidence level ) .",
    "this observation potentially marks the beginning of the multi - messenger astrophysics .    in this paper",
    "we assume the weak gbm burst is a grb ( we refer to it as gw  150914-gbm ) associated with gw  150914 and investigate its implications for the physical parameters of the system and for its surroundings .",
    "this joint electromagnetic ( em ) , gw observation was already addressed in a significant number of early studies covering aspects of em energy extraction from a binary bh system and its surroundings @xcite .",
    "integral acs observations @xcite set a constraining upper limit in terms of the source fluence in the acs energy range ( above @xmath375 kev ) .",
    "the uncertainties on the gbm spectral parameters and on the direction of the possible source , however , weaken any tension between the two measurements ( for details , see section 3.3 of * ? ? ?",
    "nonetheless , we emphasize that the association between the gbm event and gw  150914 might have occurred by chance . however , because the false alarm probability of the two events being associated is p=@xmath6 @xcite , we will _ assume _ a common origin and venture to discuss the implications for the grb emission models .",
    "there has been considerable uncertainty in the grb prompt emission model parameters , such as the compact object mass and rotation rate .",
    "for the first time however we can use realistic input parameters for modeling the bh central engine , because the gravitational wave observations yield these parameters to a precision that was previously unavailable .",
    "we calculate , to the extent that the gamma - ray observations allow , the constraints on the usual grb models that can be placed .    jets and black hole central engines are thought to be ubiquitous in grbs .",
    "energy released from the central engine becomes collimated either by magnetic stresses or the ram pressure of a progenitor star .",
    "the initial dynamics of the jet are determined by the launching radius , the size of the base of the jet , where the lorentz factor of the matter , which eventually produces the grb , is around unity .",
    "in other words the launching radius ( @xmath7 ) is the characteristic size of the volume in which energy is deposited .",
    "it is beyond this radius that the jet starts to accelerate .",
    "current methods of determining the launching radius rely on the blackbody components in the grb spectrum @xcite .",
    "@xcite found the launching radius for grb 101219b is approximately 10 times the horizon radius .",
    "this suggests the launching radius is defined by the scale of the bh central engine rather than larger scales ( @xmath8 ) such as the progenitor star ( e.g. in the case of reconfinement shocks , @xcite ) . even considering substantial progress in jet modeling ,",
    "the launching radius is one of the least well constrained physical parameters of the fireball model .",
    "the gravitational wave observations can determine the parameters of the resulting black hole and give a strict lower limit on the launching radius .    in the next section we list the observational properties of the gw and @xmath9-ray event . in section [ sec : model ]",

    "q , we use the @xmath10 scaling notation in cgs units and the physical constants have the usual meanings .",
    "the energy released in gw  150914 , @xmath11 is comparable to the isotropic equivalent energy release of very bright grbs .",
    "the final mass of the merged bh is @xmath12 and its rotation parameter is @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the gravitational radius of a 62 solar mass bh is @xmath14 , the horizon radius is @xmath15 .",
    "the innermost stable orbit which we later associate with the launching radius of the jet , is at @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 , where @xmath18 .",
    "grb models usually invoke jets emitted along the rotation axis of their progenitor bh .",
    "due to doppler boosting we can further assume our viewing angle is within the opening angle of the jet , otherwise the em emission would be highly suppressed ( essentially undetectable ) .",
    "the most favorable configuration for both gw detection and jetted emission is in case we view the binary system , perpendicular to the rotation plane .",
    "the gw signal does not have a strong dependence on the viewing angle .",
    "all things being equal , the difference in gw signal - to - noise from a face - on to an edge - on configuration is a factor of @xmath19 . due to a known degeneracy between the inclination angle and distance @xcite ,",
    "basically all the inclination angles are allowed by gw data .",
    "the observed @xmath9-rays however suggest that we see the system close to face - on .",
    "gbm detected a weak source with duration of @xmath20 which , at the time of the gw trigger was in an unfavorable position for the gbm detectors .",
    "careful analysis however reveals a source with parameters consistent with a short grb @xcite .",
    "gbm count spectra were deconvolved with detector response matrices for multiple positions within the joint gbm / ligo localization region .",
    "the resulting fit is mostly consistent with a hard power law , with photon index @xmath21 .",
    "this power law index is consistent with other weak short grbs that have been detected by gbm that can only be fit by a power law due to their low flux .",
    "the median ( mean ) value for the pl index for all weak gbm short grbs is -1.36 ( -1.40 ) .",
    "the luminosity in the 1 kev to 10 mev range , which is a good approximation for the bolometric luminosity , is @xmath22 erg s@xmath23 .",
    "hints for a possible cutoff energy come from one of the positions on the initial localization annulus , where it was possible to constrain a physically more realistic , comptonized spectrum ( power law with exponential cutoff ) :    @xmath24    short grbs are typically well fit using this model , with high peak energies and a steep spectrum above the peak energy .",
    "the assumed source position however is not compatible with the relative count rates measured in the 14 gbm detectors , and is excluded at the 90% confidence level by the _",
    "joint _ gbm - ligo localization .",
    "the event is too weak to confidently constrain more than two spectral parameters . since the best fitting power law spectrum is ultimately unphysical",
    "because it implies infinite amount of liberated energy , we carry out monte carlo simulations to evaluate the ranges of the comptonized model parameters allowed by the observations .",
    "the count spectrum has a maximum at roughly 1 mev , indicating that the spectral peak lies at that energy or above it , regardless of the details of spectral fitting .",
    "we substantiate this claim by fixing the photon index at the mean value for short grbs , -0.42 for a model with an exponential cut - off above @xmath25 , and generate a distribution of amplidudes and peak energies for all the positions along the localization arc .",
    "we find that in 94.6% of the cases the peak energy exceeded 1 mev indicating a high peak energy event similar to short grbs ( figure [ fig : sp1 ] , right ) .",
    "we also carry out a simluation where we fix the peak energy at 1 mev and fit the amplitude and the photon index ( figure [ fig : sp1 ] , left ) .",
    "significant em energy release from a binary bh merger is unexpected .",
    "the dispersion length of gravitational waves is much larger than the curvature radius associated with material surrounding the merger in any conceivable scenario ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thus no significant energy transfer is expected from gw to matter .",
    "also , no obvious debris are expected from the bh - bh merger that can aid the energy release , similar to a bh - ns or ns - ns mergers ( see however * ? ? ?",

    ", a fraction @xmath26 of the bh energy is available for extraction from a rotating bh .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath27 which is four orders of magnitude more than the observed energy release .",
    "methods of tapping energy from the merged bh include neutrino driven disks @xcite , blandford - znajek ( bz ) process @xcite ( see however @xcite ) .",
    "more conventional models for energy release in a bh system can be put forward as follows : in the gw  150914 progenitor system about @xmath28 of the initial total mass was radiated away as gw . because of the reduced central mass , orbits of the fluid elements in a disk around the final bh will be modified @xcite , possibly producing shocks .",
    "furthermore , the final bh will experience a kick associated with the anisotropic emission of gws @xcite .",
    "the angular momentum vectors of the binaries were parallelized by interaction on long time scales with circumstellar matter implying the kick will launch the black hole into the surrounding disk with @xmath29 km s@xmath23 , possibly enhancing the accretion rate .",
    "however , these mechanisms yield only @xmath30 luminosities for conditions normally expected around bh mergers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we forgo pursuing the exact nature of energy release from the bh merger which later results in the electromagnetic counterpart . specifically , we do not address the provenance of the disk material required to tap the energy of the bh . given the unexpected association of the gw and em signals , we outline the generic properties of a bh - disk system launching a jet with opening angle @xmath31 assuming the bz mechanism .",
    "our aim is to constrain the parameter space for this particular scenario through specific criteria .",
    "we assume the disk height is @xmath32 , but for @xmath33 as required by the model of @xcite the allowed parameter space does not change significantly .",
    "we illustrate the system parameters on a @xmath34 plane ( see figure [ fig : b1 ] ) .",
    "the disk has a viscosity parameter @xmath35 @xcite .    as a first criterion , we turn to the timescales governing the launch of the putative jet .",
    "the accretion timescale , during which a jet of outer radius @xmath36 is swallowed by a bh , can be calculated from the viscous timescale of the disk . as an example , for @xmath37 , the accretion time is @xmath38 .",
    "the central engine timescale ( the accretion timescale in our example , @xcite ) can be constrained to be at most the observed duration or @xmath39 s @xcite .",
    "this constraint will carve out a region in figure [ fig : b1 ] to the left of the @xmath40 s or @xmath41 line .",
    "another criterion which can constrain the physical parameters of the system is the activation of the bz mechanism . in order for the bz mechanism to occur ,",
    "the magnetohydrodynamic waves need to be able to escape the bh ergosphere @xcite .",
    "to first approximation , this translates to the alfvn velocity , @xmath42 , being larger than the free - fall velocity , @xmath43 . here",
    "@xmath44 is the disk density . defining @xmath45 , for efficient energy extraction we require @xmath46 .",
    "the exact limit , depending on the rotation parameter , can be obtained by numerical simulations @xcite and for @xmath47 ( see their figure 3 ) it can go as low as @xmath48 .",
    "we conservatively take @xmath46 at @xmath49 , to result in a constraint of @xmath50 ( see figure [ fig : b1 ] ) .",
    "the accretion velocity ( for adiabatic index @xmath51 ) can be written as @xmath52 .",
    "the sound speed is @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the kepler velocity .",
    "writing the mass accretion rate as , @xmath55 , we can express the pressure as @xmath56 .",
    "assuming the magnetic field threading the bh at the marginally stable radius ( @xmath7 ) is related to the thermal pressure through the magnetization parameter @xmath57 , ( @xmath58 ) according to @xcite , we can write : @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "next , we consider the bz luminosity ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "we define @xmath62 as the magnetic flux threading the bh horizon , @xmath63 is the angular velocity and @xmath64 .",
    "the expression for the bz luminosity : @xmath65    if the radiation emanates from a jet with half opening angle , @xmath66 , the observed , isotropic equivalent luminosity is related to the bz output power as @xmath67 .",
    "thus , the observed isotropic equivalent luminosity can be expressed as a function of @xmath68 ( assuming a jet opening angle ) and it is possible to use it to constrain the allowed parameter space of @xmath68 ( see @xmath69 lines on figure [ fig : b1 ] ) .",
    "we draw the hatched region by allowing a factor of @xmath70 around the observed luminosity of @xmath71 erg s@xmath23 . in this scenario",
    ", we can constrain the disk mass to @xmath72 , and the magnetic field threading the horizon will be @xmath73 .",
    "focusing on the gamma - ray signal , it has both spectral and temporal properties consistent with the prompt emission of a short grb .",
    "the observed luminosity is @xmath310 orders of magnitude larger than the eddington luminosity , indicating gamma - ray source has likely experienced relativistic expansion . in the grb fireball scenario",
    "the jet lorentz factor is expected to go through the acceleration phase , starting from the launching radius ( @xmath7 ) , @xmath74 .",
    "when the accelerating material has kinetic energy per unit particle of @xmath75 where @xmath76 for grbs ) is the dimensionless entropy , we have @xmath77constant .",
    "this point is marked by the saturation radius , @xmath78 .",
    "starting at the deceleration radius ( see section [ sec : es ] ) , @xmath79 , the jet enters the self - similar deceleration phase , where @xmath80 , @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "because of the weakness of the @xmath9-ray source , we will only address peak energies of models and in some cases their fluence .      in the relativistically expanding material the location where the thompson scattering optical depth falls below unity marks the position of the photosphere .",
    "this is the innermost radius from where radiation can escape and can be calculated from @xmath82 :    @xmath83    where @xmath84 is the lorentz factor separating the photosphere in the acceleration phase ( @xmath85 ) and the photosphere in the coasting phase ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "we note here that based on the joint gw and em observations this quantity can be well determined .",
    "henceforth , for brevity we use @xmath87 and @xmath88 to mark the numerical scaling values for the observed luminosity and the calculated launching radius respectively .",
    "@xmath89 . the fact that the actual lorentz factor , @xmath90 is likely larger than @xmath91 ( see e.g. section [ sec : es ] ) suggests the photosphere occurs in the acceleration region .",
    "e.g. for @xmath92 , we have @xmath93 . the observed temperature of an expanding fireball at its photosphere ( occurring in the acceleration phase ) can be calculated as @xmath94 .",
    "the maximum attainable peak energy of a spectrum with temperature @xmath95 @xcite : @xmath96 the 3.92 factor indicates that the @xmath97 is the peak in the @xmath98 representation .",
    "the fact that we know @xmath99 , the smallest possible launching radius from the gw observations , we know equation [ eq : phpk ] is a strict upper limit for the temperature of the non - dissipative photosphere .",
    "the measured peak can reach the upper limit in equation [ eq : phpk ] in the case where the photosphere occurs in the acceleration region . in this case",
    "the comoving temperature is proportional to r@xmath23 and the increase of the lorentz factor ( @xmath100 ) compensates the decrease to yield a temperature of @xmath101 .",

    "internal shocks can occur in unsteady relativistic outflows @xcite where a faster shell catches up with a slower one .",
    "the colliding shells produce shocks that accelerate electrons , amplify the magnetic field and in turn the electrons emit synchrotron radiation .",
    "this process can tap the relative kinetic energy of material ejected at different times from the central object .",
    "the radius of internal shocks can be calculated as @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the variability timescale . for short grbs ,",
    "the average @xmath106 is @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "the detailed temporal structure of the gamma - ray lightcurve could not be determined by the gbm data for this weak event .",
    "based on the gw observations , however , we can put a lower limit on the variability timescale that is the dynamic time @xmath108 such that @xmath109 .",
    "the internal shock radius ( @xmath110 ) will be well above the photosphere , implying an optically thin outflow .",

    "the electron and magnetic field equipartition parameters @xmath117 and @xmath118 are normalized to 1",
    ".    with the spectral peak constrained to be reliably above 1 mev , the above derivation suggests the internal shock model has difficulties in accounting for peak energies above 0.5 mev with a given launching radius .",
    "keeping in mind the large errors on the observed quantities , we can say this model does not naturally explain the observed peak energy , however , just as in the case of the non - dissipative photosphere models , we can not completely rule it out .",

    "we draw the deceleration time values on figure [ fig : b2 ] with light blue , and note that our monte carlo simulated spectral parameters overwhelmingly result in a deceleration time lower than the @xmath134 .",
    "we use the measurement of the peak energy ( the fact that it is likely above 1 mev ) and the peak flux density from the comptonized spectrum in the case for the fixed photon index ( figure [ fig : sp1 ] , right ) to place constraints on the particle number density around the progenitor and the lorentz factor of the outflow . on figure",

    "we note here that in the external shock scenario in its simplest , impulsive energy injection case , the timescale of the grb duration is also governed by the deceleration time .",
    "however , since the derived t@xmath141 ( @xmath142 ) and the grb duration ( @xmath143 ) differ , we argue that the grb duration reflects the energy injection timescale , which can be of the order of 1 s , instead of t@xmath141 .",

    "in this case , the measured fluence and the peak energy yields a lorentz factor and external density of ( @xmath151 ) .",
    "these are even more extreme than the values for 50% efficiency , but consistently point to the low density origin of the binary source .",
    "the deceleration time is somewhat larger in this case , @xmath152 , but still within the @xmath153=0.4 s.      because the peak energy is difficult to constrain for this event we analyze another possible scenario .",
    "we take the _ average _ photon index and peak energy for a comptonized spectrum of the short grb sample for gbm @xcite .",

    "we get a distribution of peak fluxes for the fixed value of the peak energy .",
    "it is possible then to put these parameters to the lorentz factor density plane ( see figure [ fig : b2s ] ) and deduce that the required density distribution peaks around @xmath157 with a tail extending to a few@xmath158 and the lorentz factor is @xmath159 .",
    "the deceleration time for this case is @xmath160 0.1 s , which is again consistently lower than the 0.4 s delay between the gw and em signal .",

    "the lower than usual ism density is in line with the expectation that the merger takes place far from the birthplaces of its components ( e.g. in a galactic halo environment ) .",
    "furthermore , the low density might be a more general property of the external shock model itself which , applied to model afterglow observations of grbs with @xmath163 gev photons ( e.g. grb 090510a ) yield similarly high @xmath121 and low @xmath120 @xcite .",
    "if we assume spectral parameters characteristic of short grbs , we still consistently find high @xmath121 and low @xmath120 .",
    "further gw observations with better coverage from gbm will settle if merging bh binaries indeed emit @xmath9-rays .",
    "it is possible however , that due to observer angle effects , the grb - gw association will only be settled once a sizeable sample of gw and gamma - ray observations has accumulated .",
    "indeed , gw signals from compact mergers are not strongly dependent on the orientation of the binary while prompt gamma - rays are essentially not expected if we are not inside the jet opening angle . on the other hand ,",
    "edge - on systems have on average @xmath164 the signal of the face on cases .",
    "this results in an increased likelihood that the systems detected by advanced ligo are face - on than edge - on . by measuring the jet opening angle for a grb",
    ", we can constrain the available parameter space for the inclination , measured by the advanced ligo . furthermore , detailed multiwavelength afterglow modeling ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can also constrain the viewing angle .    once gw observations become routine , and",
    "their em counterparts will be readily available , we will be able to address the question of the association of short grbs with bh mergers on a more solid footing .",
    "as an example of investigating gw  150914-gbm as a member of the short grb population , @xcite argued that it is an outlier on the @xmath165 diagram for short grbs .",
    "this may indicate a different progenitor for the gbm event .",

    "can provide a limit on the size of the jet launch .",
    "if the gw - grb association is confirmed , the variability times can be compared to the marginally stable radii resulting from the gw detection .",

    "<S> based on the peak energy and the observed flux , we find that the external shock model gives a natural explanation , suggesting a low interstellar density ( @xmath0 @xmath1 ) and a high lorentz factor ( @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we only speculate on the exact nature of the system producing the gamma - rays , and study the parameter space of a generic blandford znajek model . if future joint observations confirm the gw - short grb association we can provide similar but more detailed tests for prompt emission models .    </S>",
