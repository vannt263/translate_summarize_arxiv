    "the hermite normal form ( abbr .",
    "hnf ) is a standard representation for matrices over principal ideal domains such as @xmath2 and @xmath3 $ ] , which has many applications in algebraic group theory , integer programming , lattices , linear diophantine equations , system theory , and analysis of cryptosystems @xcite .",
    "efficient algorithms to compute hnf have been studied extensively until recently @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath1 is not a pid and a matrix over @xmath1 can not be reduced to an hnf . in @xcite , the concept of generalized hermite normal form ( abbr .",
    "ghnf ) is introduced and it is shown that any matrix over @xmath1 can be reduced to a ghnf . furthermore , a matrix @xmath4\\in\\zx^{n\\times s}$ ] is a ghnf if and only if the set of its column vectors @xmath5 forms a reduced grbner basis of the @xmath1-module generated by @xmath6 in @xmath7^n$ ] under certain monomial order . similar to the concept of lattice",
    "@xcite , a @xmath1-module in @xmath7^n$ ] is called a @xmath1-lattice which plays the same role as lattice does in the study of binomial ideals and toric varieties @xcite . for instance",
    ", the decision algorithms for some of the major properties of laurent binomial difference ideals and toric difference varieties are based on the computation of ghnfs of the exponent matrices of the difference ideals @xcite . this motivates the study of efficient algorithms to compute the ghnfs .",
    "the reduced grbner basis for a @xmath1-lattice can be computed with the grbner basis methods for modules over rings @xcite .",
    "however , such general algorithms do not take advatage of the special properties of @xmath1-modules and do not have a complexity analysis .",
    "also note that the worst case complexity of computing grbner bases in @xmath8 $ ] is double exponential @xcite .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is to give an algorithm to compute the ghnf of a matrix @xmath9 or the reduced grbner basis of the @xmath1-lattice generated by the column vectors of @xmath0 , which is both practically efficient and has polynomial bit size computational complexity .",
    "the algorithm consists of three main ingredients .",
    "the first ingredient comes from the powerful idea in faugre s f4 algorithm  @xcite and the xl algorithm  @xcite of courtois et al . to compute the grbner basis of the ideal generated by @xmath10 $ ]",
    ", these algorithms apply efficient elimination algorithms from linear algebra to the coefficient matrix of @xmath11 for certain @xmath12 .",
    "although the f4 algorithm can not improve the worst case complexity , it is generally faster than the classical buchberger algorithm @xcite . in this paper , to compute the ghnf of @xmath4\\in\\zx^{n\\times s}$ ] with columns @xmath13 , due to the special structure of the grbner bases in @xmath1 , we design a novel method to do certain prolongations @xmath14 such that the sizes of the coefficient matrices of those @xmath14 are nicely controlled .",
    "the second ingredient is a nice estimation for the degree and height bounds of the polynomials in the ghnf @xmath15 of @xmath16 .",
    "we show that the degrees and the heights of the key elements of @xmath17 are bounded by @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the maximal degree and maximal height of the polynomials in @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , we show that @xmath22 for a matrix @xmath23 and the degrees of the polynomials in @xmath24 are bounded by a polynomial in @xmath25 , which is a key factor in the complexity analysis of our algorithm .",
    "note that the degree bound also depends on the coefficients of @xmath0 .",
    "the bounds about the ghnf are obtained based on the powerful methods introduced by aschenbrenner in  @xcite , where the first double exponential algorithm for the ideal membership problem in @xmath26 $ ] is given . in order to find the degree and height bounds for the ghnf",
    ", we need to find solutions of linear equations over @xmath1 , whose degree and height are bounded . due to the special structure of the grbner basis in @xmath1 ,",
    "we give better bounds than those in  @xcite .",
    "the third ingredient is to use efficient algorithms to compute the hnf for matrices over @xmath2 .",
    "the computationally dominant step of our algorithm is to compute the hnf of the coefficient matrices of those prolongations @xmath14 obtained in the first ingredient . the first polynomial - time algorithm to compute hnf",
    "was given by kannan and bachem @xcite and there exist many efficient algorithms to compute hnfs for matrices over @xmath2 @xcite and matrices over @xmath3 $ ] @xcite .",
    "note that the ghnf for a matrix over @xmath1 can not be recovered from its hnf over @xmath3 $ ] directly .",
    "in the complexity analysis of our algorithm , we use the hnf algorithm with the best bit size complexity bound @xcite .",
    "the algorithm is implemented in magma and maple and their default hnf commands are used in our implementation . in the case of @xmath1 ,",
    "our algorithm is shown to be more efficient than the grbner basis algorithm in magma and maple . in the general case ,",
    "the proposed algorithm is also very efficient in that quite large problems can be solved .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we introduce several notations for grbner bases of @xmath1 lattices . in section 3 , we give degree and height bounds for the ghnf of a matrix over @xmath1 . in section 4 ,",
    "we give the algorithm to compute the ghnf and analyze its complexity .",
    "experimental results are shown in section 5 .",
    "finally , conclusions are presented in section 6 .",
