    "the discovery of accelerated expansion of the universe sparks surge of research on the possibility of modified gravity model ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",

    "* for review ) .",
    "the main goal of such modification is to alter the large scale behaviour to explain the weakening of gravity  however any modifications in the gravity model must at the same time satisfy the tight constraints from the solar system test .",
    "one way to fullfill this requirement is to include some kinds of screening mechanisms to suppress the modification in local environment ( high density regime ) . in this work we focus on one particular example ",
    "one that modifies gravity by introducing a dynamical scale field which mediates a fifth force .",
    "this scalar field has the nice property such that the fifth force is strongly suppressed in regions of high matter density and hence it passes the solar system test .",
    "the chameleon model of @xcite is a representative example ( other noticeable examples are the environmentally dependent dilation @xcite and symmetron @xcite models ) . the background evolution and the linear perturbations on large scale can be indistinguishable from the standard @xmath0cdm cosmology @xcite ; solar system test is satisfied by construction .",
    "hence nonlinear structure formation is the only regime where effects of such models would possibly be detected .",
    "a number of studies @xcite employed n - body numerical simulations to study nonlinear structure formation ",
    "however high resolution simulations with cosmological volume are still challenging due to the non linear equation governing the scalar field .",
    "this work aims at investigating the effect of chameleon mechanism on large scale structure .",
    "we apply the excursion set approach @xcite to compute the halo mass function in the same line as previous analyses done by @xcite .",
    "@xcite first illustrated the idea of extending the excursion set approach to calculate halo mass function in chameleon models ( see @xcite for an earlier work in this direction , where the authors studied the spherical collapse in chameleon models in detail ) .",
    "they did so by assuming a fixed lagrangian environment .",
    "@xcite improved this approach by introducing an eulerian environment .",
    "this choice avoids the unphysical requirement that all environments having the same mass ( which also places an upper limit of the halo mass ) .",
    "the calculation involves two first crossing distributions , one for the eulerian environment and the other one for the ( modified ) halo formation barrier .",
    "both studies compute the effect of the chameleon mechanism assuming uncorrrelated steps in the excursion set approach  it is the main focus of the first half of the current work to investigate how correlated steps in the excursion set approach interact with the fifth force and the chameleon mechanism .",
    "recently there are renewed interests in going beyond the uncorrelated steps excursion set in gr+@xmath0cdm cosmology to compute the halo / void abundance @xcite and the halo bias @xcite .",
    "in addition to the unconditional mass function , the excursion set approach lays down the framework to calculate the conditional mass function as well as the halo bias .",
    "the latter is of particular importance since it relates observables ( distribution of halos ) to the underlying matter distribution .",
    "since the mass function in chameleon models depends on the environment density , one may expect the conditional mass function ( and hence the halo bias ) to be modified .",
    "the second part of this paper discusses how the conditional mass function as well as the halo bias depend on the chameleon model .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in   [ sect : chameleon ] we briefly review the theoretical model to be considered and summarise its main ingredients .",
    "the effect of the chameleon mechanism on the halo mass function within the framework of excursion set approach is presented in ",
    "[ sect : correlated ] , where we also include analytical approximation for correlated steps in   [ sect : analytical ] .",
    "  [ sect : condition ] discusses the conditional mass function and halo bias in chameleon models where we show measurements in underdense environment provide a good test for chameleon signatures .",
    "finally we conclude in   [ sect : con ] .",
    "this section lays down the theoretical framework for investigating the effects of coupled scalar field(s ) in cosmology .",
    "we shall present the relevant general field equations in   [ subsect : equations ] , and then specify the models analysed in this paper in   [ subsect : specification ] .",
    "the equations presented in this sub - section can be found in @xcite , and are presented here only to make this work self - contained .",
    "we start from a lagrangian density @xmath1 + v(\\varphi ) - c(\\varphi){\\cal l}_{\\rm{dm } } + { \\cal l}_{\\rm{s}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath2 is the ricci scalar , @xmath3 with @xmath4 being the gravitational constant , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are respectively the lagrangian densities for dark matter and standard model fields .",
    "@xmath7 is the scalar field and @xmath8 its potential ; the coupling function @xmath9 characterises the coupling between @xmath7 and dark matter .",
    "given the functional forms for @xmath8 and @xmath9 a coupled scalar field model is then fully specified .",
    "varying the total action with respect to the metric @xmath10 , we obtain the following expression for the total energy momentum tensor in this model : @xmath11\\nonumber \\\\ *   & & \\quad + c(\\varphi)t^{\\rm{dm}}_{ab } + t^{\\rm{s}}_{ab},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the energy momentum tensors for ( uncoupled ) dark matter and standard model fields . the existence of the scalar field and its coupling change the form of the energy momentum tensor leading to potential changes in the background cosmology and structure formation .",
    "the coupling to a scalar field produces a direct interaction ( fifth force ) between dark matter particles due to the exchange of scalar quanta .",
    "this is best illustrated by the geodesic equation for dark matter particles @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the position vector , @xmath16 the ( physical ) time , @xmath17 the newtonian potential and @xmath18 is the spatial derivative .",
    "the second term in the right hand side is the fifth force and only exists for coupled matter species ( dark matter in our model ) .",
    "the fifth force also changes the clustering properties of the dark matter .    to solve the above two equations we need to know both the time evolution and the spatial distribution of @xmath7 , _",
    "i.e. _ we need the solutions to the scalar field equation of motion ( eom ) @xmath20 or equivalently @xmath21 where we have defined @xmath22 the background evolution of @xmath7 can be solved easily given the present day value of @xmath23 since @xmath24 .",
    "we can then divide @xmath7 into two parts , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the background value and @xmath27 is its ( not necessarily small nor linear ) perturbation , and subtract the background part of the scalar field equation of motion from the full equation to obtain the equation of motion for @xmath27 . in the quasi - static limit in which we can neglect time derivatives of @xmath27 as compared with its spatial derivatives ( which turns out to be a good approximation on scales ) , we find @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the background dark matter density .",
    "the computation of the scalar field @xmath7 using the above equation then completes the computation of the source term for the poisson equation @xmath30\\nonumber\\\\ & = & { { \\kappa}\\over{2}}\\left[c(\\varphi)\\rho_{\\rm{dm } } + \\rho_{\\rm{b } } - 2v(\\varphi)\\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the baryon density ( we have neglected the kinetic energy of the scalar field because it is always very small for the model studied here ) .      as mentioned above , to fully fix a model we need to specify the functional forms of @xmath8 and @xmath9 . here",
    "we will use the models investigated by @xcite , with @xmath32 and @xmath33^\\alpha}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above @xmath0 is a parameter of mass dimension four and is of order the present dark energy density ( @xmath7 plays the role of dark energy in the models ) .",
    "@xmath34 are dimensionless parameters controlling the strength of the coupling and the steepness of the potentials respectively",
    ".    we shall choose @xmath35 and @xmath36 as in @xcite , ensuring that @xmath37 has a global minimum close to @xmath38 and @xmath39 at this minimum is very large in high density regions .",
    "there are two consequences of these choices of model parameters : ( 1 ) @xmath7 is trapped close to zero throughout cosmic history so that @xmath40 behaves as a cosmological constant ; ( 2 ) the fifth force is strongly suppressed in high density regions where @xmath7 acquires a large mass , @xmath41 ( @xmath42 is the hubble expansion rate ) , and thus the fifth force can not propagate far .",
    "the suppression of the fifth force is even stronger at early times , and thus its influence on structure formation occurs mainly at late times .",
    "the environment - dependent behaviour of the scalar field was first investigated by @xcite , and is often referred to as the ` chameleon effect ' .",
    "in the excursion set approach the calculation of the halo mass function @xmath43 is mapped to the computation of the first crossing distribution @xmath44 across some prescribed barriers where @xmath45 in the following we use the two terms interchangeably .",
    "the variance of the matter fluctuation field smoothed on scale @xmath2 is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the smoothing window function and @xmath48 is the matter power spectrum linear extrapolated to the present time . in hierarchical models @xmath49 is a monotonic decreasing function of @xmath2 and the smoothing scale in lagrangian space @xmath2 , the total mass enclosed within this scale @xmath50 , and the variance @xmath49 are equivalent quantities and can be used interchangeably .",
    "recent work @xcite demonstrated how the chameleon - type fifth force modifies the first crossing probability and the associated halo mass function for lagrangian and eulerian environment .",
    "this modification is due to the dependence of the halo formation barrier height @xmath51 on the matter density of its surrounding environment , @xmath52 to denote the initial density perturbation in the environment linearly extrapolated to today assuming a @xmath0cdm model .",
    "knowing @xmath52 it is straightforward to calculate the true environment density in subsequent times using the assumed evolution model . ] . since the fifth force is strongest when the environment density is low , the barrier for halo formation is lower where @xmath52 is small .",
    "the upper panel in figure  [ fig : delc ] shows the halo formation barrier as a function of @xmath49 for various values of @xmath52 assuming that the spherical collapse model describes halo formation , and confirms that the fifth force is stronger in underdense environment where the associated barrier is lower .",
    "the actual height that the random walks with various @xmath52 need to climb to reach the modified barrier is shown in the lower panel  although the barrier in underdense environment is lower , the barrier to overcome is actually higher .     from -1.2 to 1.2 with increment 0.2 .",
    "constant barrier at the top is the case with no fifth force ( i.e. , @xmath0cdm ) .",
    "lower panel : the height need to climb to reach the halo formation barrier for various @xmath52.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    @xcite , when applying the excursion set approach in chameleon models , focused on the case where the excursion set is performed with uncorrelated steps with two different definitions of environment . in both cases",
    "the modifications in the first crossing distribution in chameleon models are solely due to the change in the barrier .",
    "the situation is more complicated when the steps in the random walk are correlated : two additional effects can modify the first crossing distribution .",
    "firstly , the distribution of @xmath52 for eulerian environments is modified and , since the halo formation barrier depends on @xmath52 , the first crossing probability will be modified as well . note however that when the environment is defined as lagrangian , the distribution of @xmath52 is unchanged .",
    "secondly , there will be non - trivial correlations between the environment density contrast @xmath52 and the density contrast @xmath53 at different @xmath49 .    to investigate how these two effects modify the first crossing distribution in models with chameleon mechanism , we use monte - carlo simulations to study the first crossing distribution for three choices of smoothing window functions following the procedures in @xcite .",
    "our convention is such that the normalisation of the power spectrum is set by demanding @xmath54 for the tophat filter .",
    "the sharp-_k _ smoothing window function generates random walks with uncorrelated steps and it is common practice to use the @xmath55 mapping of the tophat window function to relate the variance and the smoothing scale for the sharp-_k _ smoothing window function .",
    "we consider @xmath0cdm power spectrum and two environment scales : an eulerian environment , which denoted by @xmath56 , is the environment at late time ; and a lagrangian environment , which denoted by @xmath57 , is the environment in the initial conditions .",
    "we assume both environments are spherical regions that share common centers as the proto - halos .",
    "the actual scale of the environment should be approximately the compton wavelength of the scalar field at late time .",
    "numerical simulation results suggest that an eulerian scale of @xmath58 should be chosen @xcite . in this work",
    "we consider an eulerian evironment @xmath59mpc and a lagrangian environment @xmath60mpc , and set @xmath61 as the chameleon model parameters . in the language of excursion set formalism ,",
    "the lagrangian environment barrier ( fixing @xmath49 ) corresponds to a vertical barrier in the @xmath62 plane while the eulerian environment barrier is given by the spherical collapse model @xcite : @xmath63,\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the background density .",
    "figure  [ fig : pdelenv ] shows the distribution of @xmath52 for @xmath65 ( upper panel ) and @xmath66 ( lower panel ) .",
    "three histograms corresponding to tophat ( solid ) , gaussian ( dashed ) , and sharp-_k _ ( dotted ) window functions are shown in each panel .",
    "we ran a sample of random walk whose correlation satisfies the corresponding smoothing filter function .",
    "we then record the height of the random walk at which it first crosses the environmental barrier . in the case of lagrangian environment",
    "we set @xmath67 if the random walk first crosses @xmath68 on scale bigger than @xmath57 .",
    "since we use the same @xmath55 mapping for the tophat window function and the sharp-@xmath69 window function , choosing a lagrangian scale fixes @xmath49 and hence the two will have the same distribution .",
    "the difference between the distributions of gaussian smoothing and the others in the case of lagrangian environment is due to our choice of power spectrum normalization  for @xmath66 , @xmath70 for the gaussian filter while @xmath71 for the tophat and sharp-_k _ filters . here",
    "since the lagrangian @xmath52 distribution is the same for the tophat and sharp-_k _ filters , any difference in their first crossing distributions due to the fifth force has to come from the non - trivial correlations between the height of the random walk and @xmath52 ( see below ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the distributions in eulerian environment are different for all three smoothing windows : the sharp-_k _ filter peaks at highest @xmath52 while the gaussian filter peaks at lowest @xmath52 . as a result",
    "the effect of the fifth force is stronger when the gaussian window function is used ",
    "the halo formation barrier for walks with gaussian filter is lower than that of uncorrelated walks .",

    "the histograms show the distribution when there is no fifth force : it is the first crossing for a constant barrier at @xmath76 .",
    "the line labels are the same as in figure  [ fig : pdelenv ] .",
    "symbols represent the first crossing distributions for different combinations of smoothing window functions and choices of environment , as indicated in the legends .",
    "the first crossing distributions change significantly when the random walks switch from uncorrelated steps ( sharp-_k _ ) to the correlated one ( gaussian and tophat ) ; different definitions of the environment have subdominant effect .",
    "to better visualise the effect of different choices of the environment , the lower panel shows the relative difference in the distribution to the corresponding constant barrier distribution .",
    "the modifications in the first crossing distribution due to the chameleon - type fifth force are quite different for random walks with correlated steps ( both gaussian and tophat filters ) versus walks with uncorrelated steps .",
    "for example the modifications of the correlated steps are displaced from those of the uncorrelated steps for @xmath77 . since the modification in the halo mass function is around 20% , this @xmath78% displacement is a big contribution .",
    "consider for example the tophat ( solid squares ) and the sharp-_k _",
    "( open squares ) lagrangian environments  since they have the same distribution @xmath79 , the difference in the predicted modification in the first crossing distributions must be due to the nontrivial correlations between different smoothing scales when the window function is tophat .",
    "one can imagine the following scenario : random walks with correlated steps are less likely to have dramatic fluctuations compared to those with uncorrelated steps  when @xmath80 , the enhanced fifth force lowers the barrier @xmath81  in both uncorrelated and correlated cases , it is easier to cross the barrier .",
    "however correlated walks are not likely have sudden jumps , hence the modification in the first crossing comes only at bigger @xmath49 : it explains the difference between the solid ( tophat lagrangian ) and open ( sharp-_k _ lagrangian ) symbols for @xmath82 ( lagrangian scale @xmath66 corresponds to @xmath83 ) . for",
    "bigger @xmath49 the correlated walks do not need have sudden jumps to cross the barrier  hence the increase in the first crossing probability . on the other hand , the increase for the uncorrelated walks is smaller since some of those walks already cross the barrier at smaller @xmath49 . for @xmath84 ,",
    "the fifth force is weak and only slightly enhances structure formation . in this case",
    "walks with correlated steps may upcross the barrier sooner than walks with uncorrelated steps ( since uncorrelated walks can have sudden decrease in height ) .",
    "it will result in higher probability in first crossing distribution for correlated steps for @xmath49 near the chameleon environment  however this modification in the first crossing distribution relative to the gr case is small due to the weakening of the fifth force . recall that it is equally likely to have overdense and underdense environment in lagrangian environment , the net effect is",
    "correlated steps show a smaller change in first crossing probability for small @xmath85 but bigger change for big @xmath85 .",
    "the change in first crossing distribution for gaussian filter and lagrangian environment is strong in high @xmath86 .",
    "it is consistent with the change in the distribution of @xmath52 shown in figure  [ fig : pdelenv ] : since @xmath79 has a narrower distribution with a peak at @xmath87 , the overdense environments in the gaussian case generally have lower @xmath52 and so the fifth force is stronger ( lower barrier ) compared to the walks with tophat or sharp-_k _ filter . on the other hand",
    "the change at low mass end is similar to others  although there are more walks that have underdense lagrangian environments for the other two filters , those walks need to climb a huge distance to cross their respective modified barriers and do not make a significant contribution in the first crossing distribution .      in this subsection",
    "we apply the analytical approximation proposed by @xcite to estimate the first crossing distribution in chameleon models . in this analytical approximation the first crossing probability at @xmath85 is approximated by both the height and its rate of change at @xmath88 .",
    "the first crossing distribution across barrier @xmath89 is @xmath90 where the dash denotes derivative with respect to @xmath85 , @xmath91 is the conditional probability density of the rate of change in height @xmath92 at @xmath85 given that the walk s height is @xmath93 at the same scale @xmath85 , and @xmath94 is the probability density that the walk has height @xmath93 at the smoothing scale @xmath85 .",
    "when the lagrangian environment is used in the chameleon models , the first crossing distribution of the modified barrier @xmath95 at @xmath85 is @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the distribution of environmental density contrast at scale @xmath57 . strictly speaking @xmath97",
    "should be replaced by the condition probability that @xmath53 never crosses @xmath68 for scales bigger than @xmath57 , but the scales we apply the lagrangian environment is big enough so that the difference between the two is small .",
    "figure  [ fig : nufnulag ] shows the comparison of the analytical approximation and the monte - carlo results for lagrangian environment of @xmath98 .",
    "the upper panel shows the results of gaussian window function while the lower panel shows the tophat window function . in each panel",
    "the top half shows the first crossing distribution from analytical prediction ( curve ) and the monte - carlo result ( symbols ) , and the bottom half shows the modifications to the first crossing distribution relative to gr .",

    "the vertical dotted lines show the scales of the lagrangian environment.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the first crossing distribution for eulerian environment contains two first crossings : first to cross the environment barrier , then the halo formation barrier .",
    "applying the approximation to both crossings yields @xmath100 where we denote the eulerian environment barrier as @xmath101 and @xmath102 is the derivative of @xmath52 at @xmath49 .",
    "the dependence of the halo barrier @xmath89 on @xmath101 is implicit .",
    "the first integral includes walks with different eulerian environment density contrast ( up to @xmath85 ) while the second integral corresponds to the first crossing of the eulerian barrier at @xmath49 . here",
    "one should have replaced the upper limit of the integration such that the walk would not cross @xmath68 at @xmath49  in practice the probability of having a big jump is not likely so using the above approximation does not alter the result .",
    "finally the rest corresponds to the first crossing of the modified halo barrier at @xmath85 given the walk first crossed the eulerian barrier at @xmath49 with an increase in height @xmath102 when going from @xmath103 to @xmath49 .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : nufnueul ] .     but using eulerian environment @xmath104.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the analytical approximation works relatively well for big @xmath86 ( @xmath105 ) but breaks down for small @xmath86 , as in the case of lagrangian environment .",
    "the conditional probability distributions in this subsection are also gaussian distributed with mean and variance given by @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the covariance matrix of @xmath108 and we assume all variables have unconditional means vanish in the above formuale .",
    "in this section we will describe the effect of the chameleon - type fifth force on the conditional mass function and the halo bias . as explained in the previous section ,",
    "the fifth force is stronger when the environment is less dense  effectively the halo formation criterion is lower and hence the first crossing of halo formation barrier is easier .",
    "one may then ask if this effect will be more significant when we look at the conditional mass function , especially for underdense regions . here",
    "we will use monte carlo simulations to investigate how the conditional mass function responses to the fifth force introduced by the chameleon models .",
    "we now have two environments : one is used to solve the fifth force in the chameleon model ( we will call it the _ chameleon _ environment hereafter and we choose @xmath59mpc and @xmath75mpc ) and the other is a _ large - scale _ environment @xmath109 on which the condition is defined .",
    "we will choose @xmath110 to be small ( hence very large scale ) so that it is safe to assume that the range of the fifth force is much smaller than the scale corresponding to @xmath110 .",
    "in this subsection we will look at the conditional first crossing probability for three different smoothing window functions .",
    "the conditional first crossing probability is @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the conditional first crossing probability across the @xmath113 barrier given that it first crosses the environment barrier @xmath114 at @xmath52 _ and _ it has @xmath115 at @xmath110 .",
    "@xmath116 is the conditional first crossing probability of crossing the environment barrier at @xmath52 .",
    "changing the large scale environment can have two effects :    1 .   it modifies the distribution of @xmath52 : when @xmath117 , it is more likely to have less dense chameleon environment ( @xmath52 is smaller ) and hence the fifth force will be stronger .",
    "it also affects the first crossing distribution of the halo formation barrier when the random walk is non - markovian ( this effect is additional to the first point where the halo formation barrier is changed due to the change of environment distribution ) .",
    "one may expect the second effect to be weaker than the first since the correlation is weaker for bigger difference in @xmath49 .",
    "in particular , for sharp-_k _ filter where the random walks have uncorrelated steps , the walks are markovian and the large scale environment @xmath118 only modifies the distribution of @xmath52 , that is , @xmath119 we are going to quantify the effect in this section using monte - carlo simulations .",

    "different panels use different smoothing window functions , from top to bottom : sharp-_k _ , tophat , and gaussian filters .",
    "the conditional mass function differs from the unconditional mass function and the change depends on smoothing window function as well as the large scale density contrast @xmath122 : in general conditional distributions using gaussian or tophat window functions and having more extreme values of @xmath122 show more significant changes compared to the respective unconditional distribution .",
    "the large scale environment modifies the distribution of the linear density contrast at the chameleon environment , which in turn modifies the first crossing distribution .",
    "the modification depends on the smoothing window functions due to the difference in correlation strength between various scales involved ( the large scale environment , the chameleon environment , as well as the scale at which the halo barrier is first crossed ) .",
    "we took the ratio of the change in first crossing distribution for conditional walks to that of the unconditional walks and the results are shown in figure  [ fig : connmassratio0.5b0.25 ] and [ fig : connmassratio0.9b0.25 ] for @xmath130 and @xmath131 respectively when @xmath132 .",

    "the excursion set approach provides a natural way to relate halo abundance and halo bias  by starting",
    "the random walks at some prescribed locations rather the origin @xcite .",
    "the relative difference of this conditional first crossing probability to the unconditional one gives the left hand side of equation  .",
    "recently there are several studies @xcite on evaluating the halo bias using the excursion set approach with correlated steps .",
    "both of the analyses ( using very different methods ) found that the halo bias with correlated steps is stronger than the uncorrelated case .",
    "@xcite also suggests that , when correlated steps are considered , the halo bias computed from the excursion set approach is different from the one obtained by taking the ratio of the halo - matter power spectrum and the matter power spectrum .",
    "while we are interested in computing the halo bias with correlated steps , we do not make the distinction here and we will present the halo bias evaluated within the excursion set framework .    in the chameleon models",
    "the halo formation barrier in the excursion set approach depends on the environment density . to estimate the halo bias we use the conditional first crossing distributions obtained in the previous subsection and",

    "the three panels show results using different smoothing window functions and the results for chameleon models are shifted by @xmath149 .     and @xmath150 for the conditional first crossing distribution where triangles ( squares ) represent positive ( negative ) @xmath122 .",

    "are shown in figure  [ fig : b1eul ] and [ fig : b1lag ] for the eulerian and lagrangian environments respectively .",
    "in both environment definitions the relative difference of the halo bias in chameleon models can be of factor of a few , regardless of the window functions used .",
    "another noticeable signature is the difference of the mass range where the halo bias relative difference is most significant : when the tophat or gaussian window filters are used , the change in halo bias for most overdense environment ( triangles , @xmath151 ) is most significant around @xmath152 but it is shifted to lower mass @xmath153 for underdense environment ( solid lines , @xmath154 ) .",
    "this difference in mass range is getting smaller when @xmath122 is less extreme ( see the difference between squares and dotted lines for @xmath155 ) . combining the measurements of the halo bias in very overdense and underdense environments to the gr predictions ( analytical formula or measurements from numerical simulations )",

    "two different environment definitions ( eulerian environment at @xmath104 and lagrangian environment @xmath156 ) are combined with three different smoothing window functions : gaussian , tophat , and sharp-_k _ , to study how correlations between different scales induced by the window functions interact with the fifth force .",
    "the halo formation barrier in the chameleon model depends on the environment density @xmath52  in an accompanied paper @xcite we discussed the change in the mass function for eulerian environment versus lagrangian environment for uncorrelated steps ( i.e. sharp-_k _ window filter ) using the excursion set approach . in that case",
    "the difference in the two environments only modifies the distribution of @xmath52 and subsequently the first crossing distribution .",
    "additional effect due to the non - trivial correlations between different smoothing scales arises when the smoothing function is gaussian or tophat .",
    "we used monte - carlo simulations to demonstrate the additional correlations indeed modify the first crossing distribution and the contribution is significant , particularly in intermediate to low mass range .",
    "we then applied the analytical formalism proposed in @xcite to compute the first crossing distribution for correlated steps .",
    "the analytical prediction matches the monte - carlo simulations well for high mass regime .",
    "having shown the significance of correlated steps in the unconditional first crossing distribution , we examined the conditional mass function in chameleon models .",
    "when the steps in the excursion set are uncorrelated , the condition that random walks having passed through some @xmath122 at a prescribed large scale @xmath110 only alters the distribution of @xmath52 due to the markovian nature of uncorrelated steps .",
    "correlated steps ( the random walk is non - markovian ) introduce an additional effect due to the non - trivial correlations between @xmath110 and all other scales .",
    "we compared the change in the first crossing distribution due to the fifth force for conditional walks to that of unconditional walks and found that walks in underdense large scale environment experience a stronger modification compared to those in overdense large scale environment  this effect is observed in all the three smoothing window functions ( with different strengths ) usually used in the literature . hence combining the conditional halo mass function in underdense large scale environment with the unconditional mass function",
    "can potentially provide a strong probe for modified gravity .",
    "finally we investigate how the chameleon models modify the halo bias derived from the excursion set approach .",
    "we found that the fifth force can modify the halo bias by a factor of a few at intermediate to low mass halos when underdense large scale environment is assumed .",
    "in addition we found that , when the correlated steps are used , the masses at which the halo bias is modified by the chameleon - type fifth force can be quite different for overdense and underdense environments .",
    "while this difference depends on the value of @xmath122 , we found that @xmath157 when @xmath122 at 2-@xmath158 level for @xmath159 .",
    "the effect of the correlations between different smoothing scales introduced by the use of different smoothing window functions on halo abundance and halo bias has been the focus of some the recent studies .",
    "its application with the excursion set approach in the chameleon models results in further modifications in both halo abundance and the halo bias .",
    "in particular the change in the conditional mass function and the halo bias in underdense environment may provide potentially strong constraints on the chameleon models .",
    "another test we are investigating is the strength of correlations between the halo formation and the surrounding environment by measuring halo abundance and clustering under different environments in numerical simulations of chameleon models .",
