    "recent developments in the nanofabrication of semiconductor devices have given a thrust to the study of quantum mechanical systems with position dependent effective mass .",
    "the spatial dependence on the effective mass of the particle arises due to its interaction with an ensemble of particles within the device , as the particle propagates from left to right .",
    "this so - called position - dependent effective mass ( pdem ) formalism becomes an essential ingredient in describing the electronic and transport properties of quantum wells and quantum dots , impurities in crystals , he - clusters , quantum liquids , semiconductor heterostructures , etc . @xcite .",
    "when two such materials ( having pdem ) with different bandgaps are placed adjacent to each other to form a heterojunction , the effective mass approximation is valid within each material .",
    "if , for example , a thin layer of a narrower ( wider ) bandgap material is sandwiched between two layers of a wider ( narrower ) bandgap material , they form a double heterojunction .",
    "if the intermediate layer is sufficiently thin for quantum properties to be exhibited , then the alignment is called a single quantum well ( barrier ) .",
    "a typical quantum well structure may be composed of a semiconductor thin film , embedded between two semi - infinite semiconductor materials , say @xmath1 , where @xmath2 denotes the mole fraction . as the mole fraction varies along the @xmath3-axis , so does the effective mass of the charge carrier ( electron or hole ) . to have a complete understanding of such a quantum system , quantum mechanics",
    "requires knowledge of both bound and scattering states .",
    "various attempts have been made over the years to study the scattering states in such position - dependent effective mass systems @xcite . in two of the recent works @xcite , the authors studied the effect of hard wall confinement and lateral dimensions on low temperature transport properties of long diffuse channels in @xmath4 heterostructures @xcite , and resonant inelastic x - ray scattering in @xmath5 heterostructures @xcite . in another work ,",
    "ballistic carrier emission was studied with @xmath1 as a model system @xcite . in one of the relatively earlier works , the authors considered the simple model of a square potential well , with the effective mass varying with position inside the well @xcite . however , as the additional term introduced by the changing mass is small compared with the original potential @xmath6 and does not change the shape of the potential significantly , this term was neglected while finding the solutions .    in the present work",
    "our aim is to obtain the exact analytical solutions for the scattering states of a particle inside a single quantum well / barrier .",
    "it may be mentioned that exact analytical solutions play an important role in conceptual understanding of physics .",
    "they provide a valuable platform for checking and improving approximate models and numerical results .",
    "herein lies the motivation for obtaining exact analytical solutions of wave equations with pdem , especially because of the wide range of applications of these solutions in various areas of material science and condensed matter @xcite . in the double heterojunction considered here ,",
    "we assume the intermediate layer to be a potential well / barrier of the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 represent the heterojunctions .",
    "the mass of the charge carrier is assumed to be spatially varying inside the potential well / barrier @xmath10 , but constant outside , viz , @xmath11 thus both the potential @xmath12 and mass @xmath13 are real functions of the configuration space coordinates , and are taken to be continuous throughout the semiconductor device .",
    "the work done in refs .",
    "@xcite deserve special mention here . in ref .",
    "@xcite approximate analytical solutions were derived for any arbitrary potential and arbitrary mass function , whereas in ref .",
    "@xcite , some special forms of the mass function were considered for oscillator , coulomb and morse potentials to produce exact analytical results .",
    "however , our study differs significantly from both these works  the mass functions considered in our case , as well as the approach used , are different from refs . @xcite and @xcite ; the present article not only gives exact analytic results but also plots the transmission and reflection coefficients .",
    "more importantly , unlike @xcite , this work deals with a double heterojunction .",
    ".2 cm    the article is organized as follows : for the sake of completeness , the position - dependent - mass schrdinger equation is introduced in section ii , and the method of obtaining the solutions is discussed .",
    "a couple of explicit models are studied in section iii . to give a better insight into the physical nature of the problem ,",
    "the potential and mass functions are plotted as a function of @xmath3 ( in fig . 1 and fig .",
    "3 ) along with the scattering solutions ( in fig . 2 and fig .",
    "the transmission and reflection coefficients are also calculated and the same are plotted as a function of the energy of the particle , in fig . 5 and fig .",
    "6 respectively .",
    "section iv is kept for conclusions and discussions .",
    "we start with the basic one dimensional time independent schrdinger equation associated with a particle endowed with pdem in the intermediate region within the heterojunctions : @xmath14      \\psi ( z ) = e \\psi ( z)\\ ] ] where the kinetic energy term @xmath15 is given by @xcite @xmath16 with @xmath17 being the momentum operator , and the ambiguity parameters @xmath18 obeying the von roos constraint @xcite @xmath19 there is neither a unique nor a universal choice for the ambiguity parameters , and several suggestions exist in literature  e.g. @xmath20 @xcite , @xmath21 @xcite , @xmath22 @xcite , @xmath23 @xcite , etc .",
    "however , for continuity conditions at the abrupt interfaces , one should consider @xmath24 , or else one gets the unphysical result of the wave function vanishing at the heterojunctions ; additionally the ground state energy also diverges @xcite .",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to the bendaniel - duke choice for the ambiguity parameters , viz .",
    ", @xmath25 .",
    "incidentally , this particular choice consistently produces the best fit to experimental results @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we shall work in units @xmath26 , and use prime to denote differentiation w.r.t .",
    "thus , inside the potential well / barrier @xmath10 , the hamiltonian for the particle with pdem reduces to @xcite @xmath27 whereas , outside the well / barrier , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , the particle obeys the conventional schrdinger equation : @xmath30 having plane wave solutions . in case",
    "we consider a wave incident from left , the solutions in the two regions are @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 denote the reflection and transmission amplitudes , and @xmath34    .1 cm    to find the solution in the region @xmath10 , we make use of the following transformations @xcite @xmath35 which reduce the schrdinger equation for position - dependent mass , to one for constant mass , viz . , @xmath36 with @xmath37 we are interested in studying the scattering states of a particle in a double heterojunction , formed by dissimilar materials , where the mass of the particle varies with position inside the well / barrier .",
    "such heterojunctions can be described by a material potential which derives from the difference in bandgaps @xcite .",
    "crystal potential of multiple heterojunction can also be described in this manner . for this purpose , we look for some definite practical forms of @xmath12 and @xmath13 which will give exact analytical solutions of ( [ schro - const - m ] ) .",
    "we illustrate this with the help of a couple of explicit models in the next section .",
    "the one dimensional finite square well is one of the simplest confinement potentials . in the first example , we consider the region between the abrupt heterojunctions ( @xmath38 ) to be a symmetric potential well ( more realistic than the square well ) with the following ansatz ( @xmath39 being some constant ) @xmath40 this particular model resembles the profile of a diffused quantum well , with the advantage of exact analytical solutions . in case the real situation is slightly different from this model , one can apply approximation methods like perturbation theory , etc .",
    ", to obtain the solutions . + let the mass of the particle be @xmath41 where @xmath42 is some constant parameter . for the spatial mass dependence given by eq .",

    "( [ psi - z ] ) transforms the coordinate @xmath3 to @xmath43 so that after some straightforward algebra @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ v - tilde ] ) reduces to @xmath45 thus equation ( [ schro - const - m ] ) can be written as @xmath46 @xmath47 and the parameter @xmath48 depends on the constants @xmath39 and @xmath42 , through the equation @xmath49 for existence of bound states @xmath50 ; hence , @xmath51 .",
    "this gives the permissible values of @xmath52 as @xmath53    [ ]    for a better understanding of the mass dependence and the potential in the semiconductor device , we plot @xmath13 and @xmath54 as a function of @xmath3 in fig .",
    "1 , for a suitable set of parameter values , viz . , @xmath55 .",
    "let us introduce a new variable @xmath56 and write the solutions of ( [ schro - rho ] ) as @xmath57 in terms of the new variable @xmath58 , equation ( [ schro - rho ] ) reduces to the hypergeometric equation @xmath59 with complete solution @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are constants , and the parameters @xmath63 and @xmath64 are as defined below : @xmath65 thus for the even solution @xmath66 , whereas for the odd solution @xmath67 .",
    "after some straightforward algebra , the final solution to the position - dependent mass schrdinger equation ( [ h - em ] ) , within the potential well @xmath68 , is obtained as @xmath69 whereas outside the well ( @xmath70 ) , the solutions are given by eq ( [ psi - out ] ) , with @xmath71 .",
    "[ ]    for scattering states , @xmath72 should be positive , implying @xmath73 . now , because of the spatial dependence of the mass function , the boundary conditions need to be modified  + the functions @xmath74 and @xmath75 should be continuous at each heterojunction @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "these conditions enable us to evaluate the reflection and transmission amplitudes @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively .",
    "the complete solutions for the scattering states in the entire region @xmath77 are plotted in fig .",
    "2 , for the same set of parameter values as in fig .",
    "1 , viz . , @xmath78 .",
    "the solutions show a definite nonlinear character inside the well ( @xmath79 ) , where the particle mass @xmath80 is a function of its position @xmath3 .",
    "thus the effect of the position - dependent mass potential well ( in this particular model ) is to introduce a non linear component in the otherwise plane wave solutions .      as the second example , we consider the region within the double heterojunction ( @xmath10 ) to be represented by an _ inverted _ morse potential ( barrier ) @xcite : @xmath81 with positive @xmath6 .",
    "the transmission coefficient of a potential barrier has wide applications in nuclear fission , heavy - ion fusion , tunnelling in solids @xcite , etc ; hence we shall calculate both the transmission as well as reflection coefficients and plot them as a function of the energy of the particle .",
    "the morse barrier potential is particularly useful in investigating the anharmonicities of the vibrational spectra in molecular and nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "for the mass function of the particle , we consider @xmath82    [ ]    in fig .",
    "3 , we show the plot of @xmath13 and @xmath54 for this particular model , for a suitable set of parameter values , viz . , @xmath83 , with the heterojunctions at @xmath84 .    for the spatial mass dependence given by eq .",
    "( [ mass - morse ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ psi - z ] ) transforms the coordinate @xmath3 to @xmath85 so that after some straightforward algebra @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ v - tilde ] ) reduces to the simple form @xmath86 thus the schrdinger equation for constant mass ( [ schro - const - m ] ) takes the final form @xmath87 with @xmath88 . to solve equation ( [ schro - morse ] ) given above ,",
    "let us introduce a new variable @xmath89 in terms of which equation ( [ schro - morse ] ) gets simplified to the form of a whittaker differential equation @xcite @xmath90 with @xmath91 the solutions of eq ( [ whittaker - eq ] ) are given as @xcite @xmath92 where @xmath93 are the whittaker functions and @xmath94    thus for the entire semiconductor device , the complete solution for the scattering states in the different regions are given by @xmath95 where the constants @xmath96 and the reflection and transmission amplitudes @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively , are determined by matching the boundary conditions ( for pdem systems ) at the heterojunctions , and @xmath58 and @xmath97 are as defined above .",
    "the complete solutions for the entire region @xmath98 are plotted in fig .",
    "4 , for a suitable set of parameter values , viz . , @xmath99 .",
    "the solutions show a definite nonlinear character inside the barrier ( @xmath100 ) , where the particle mass is dependent on its position .",
    "thus the effect of the position - dependent mass barrier ( similar to that of the position dependent potential well in the previous example ) is to introduce a non linear component in the plane wave solutions .",
    "to conclude , we obtained the exact analytical solutions for the scattering states of a particle ( electron or hole ) inside a semiconductor device with a double heterojunction , when the mass of the particle is assumed to be dependent on its position inside the heterojunctions , but constant outside .",
    "we studied two explicit models in this work  one a pdem diffused potential well , the other a pdem potential barrier ( morse barrier ) . in each case",
    "it is observed that the effect of the spatial dependence on the particle mass is to introduce a non linear component in the otherwise plane wave solutions .",
    "[ ]    [ ]    we also calculated the transmission and reflection coefficients , @xmath101 and @xmath102 respectively , for the potentials studied here .",
    "these are plotted in fig . 5 and fig .",
    "6 respectively , as a function of the energy @xmath103 for the pdem particle in a morse barrier . as the energy increases",
    ", the transmission coefficient also increases , finally reaching unity , whereas the reflection coefficient follows the reverse trend and goes to zero .",
    "this observation is similar to that in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors show that the transmission coefficient for the one - dimensional scattering problem with pdem normally tends to unity as energy goes to infinity , provided the mass is a continuous function of position .",
    "this simple , yet straightforward approach is just a way of understanding basic physics of the electronic properties of a semiconductor device , comprising of a double heterojunction , where the intermediate layer is sufficiently thin for quantum properties to be exhibited .",
    "it is expected that the observations made in this work will provide some useful insight in studies related to electron transport in semiconductor heterostructures , i.e. in the physical properties of such materials .",
    "actual materials are made up of a large number of atomic potentials .",
    "nevertheless , the crystal potential may be approximated by a single potential  the global average of the individual potentials , and this approach would still be valid . however , for extremely thin intermediate layer , the individual potentials may become significant enough for this approximation to break down .",
    "this calls for a more rigorous approach , and we propose to take up its study in the near future .",
    "the author thanks p. roy for some very fruitful discussions . financial assistance for the work",
    "was provided for by the dept . of science and technology , govt . of india , through its grant sr / wos - a / ps-06/2008 .",
