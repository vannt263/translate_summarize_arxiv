    "<S> a reanalysis of identified muon neutrino interactions from imb 3 yields bounds on @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the limit @xmath2 is in conflict with the recent announcement of a neutrino mass .    </S>",
    "<S> subject headings : cosmic rays  elementary particles  neutrino oscillations +    atmospheric neutrinos have always held the possibility of providing a large range of propagation coupled with a near source to provide a convenient calibration . with a reasonable choice of angular cuts a sample of neutrinos traveling about 10,000 km can easily be compared with a sample traveling on the order of 20 km collected in the same experiment at the same time . </S>",
    "<S> early work @xcite using these concepts was hampered by low statistics and poor particle identification . in @xcite a mixed sample of 25 upward neutrino interactions </S>",
    "<S> was compared with a sample of 25 downward neutrino interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the neutrino propagation distance is a function of the neutrino direction , so scattering can , in principle , make the distance estimate ambiguous . in reality </S>",
    "<S> the propagation distance varies very slowly with angle near the vertical so as long as regions near the vertical are compared scattering will have a negligible effect on the sensitivity . in most analyses regions containing 20% of the solid angle over the upward and downward direction </S>",
    "<S> have been used .    </S>",
    "<S> depending on the location of the detector the upward and downward fluxes may be influenced differently by geomagnetic effects@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> imb was located at 52@xmath3 north geomagnetic latitude . </S>",
    "<S> this meant that the local flux , coming from above , had a lower geomagnetic cut off than the earth at large . </S>",
    "<S> as such one would expect a greater rate of downward going events since the lower cut off permitted more of the extraterrestrial cosmic ray flux to descend and hit the atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> but such effects are small and have not been observed in a statistically significant way even in a sample of 401 neutrino interactions@xcite . in the 401 imb 1 sample 55 events </S>",
    "<S> were measured in the upward going 20% of the solid angle and 65 were found in a comparable portion of downward solid angle . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of the 15 upward events and 21 downward events which were classified as muon neutrino induced because of the presence of a muon decay in the event yielded limits on @xmath1 in the range of @xmath4 ev@xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> imb 3 provided a comparable sample of events but with better light collection and with morphologically based muon identification methods@xcite as well as those based on muon decay signatures . </S>",
    "<S> an analysis comparing the shape of the energy distribution for the upward and downward 20% of the solid angle@xcite confirmed the imb 1 results but with a larger sample and with particle identification . </S>",
    "<S> the imb 3 work was done with 34 downward going and 32 upward going @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> these two samples have energy distributions which are statistically indistinguishable .    the excluded region derived in @xcite is bounded in the range @xmath7 ev@xmath5 . outside of this range distortion of the upward going neutrino spectrum by neutrino oscillations </S>",
    "<S> would not make its _ shape _ statistically distinguishable from the measured downward spectrum .    </S>",
    "<S> the contained neutrino interactions can be used to study neutrino oscillations over a broader range of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest limits on @xmath1 are found in comparisons of the shape of the observed contained event energy spectra for samples of events near the vertical . </S>",
    "<S> such a test is insensitive to detailed flux calculations , since the downward sample constitutes a measured near source . </S>",
    "<S> the method has a limited range because for larger @xmath1 the upward going sample would be fully mixed via multiple oscillations and hence would have a spectrum shape that was similar to the unoscillated downward sample . </S>",
    "<S> the upward sample would be reduced by an overall factor , which is @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> so comparison of rate of upward to downward going @xmath6 interactions can extend the sensitive range . </S>",
    "<S> this comparison eventually fails at even higher @xmath1 because at large @xmath1 both the upward and downward going samples will have oscillated . in such cases oscillations may be noted by deviations of the observations from expectations . </S>",
    "<S> estimates of @xmath1 would be unreliable since no distance scale would be present in the observations .    </S>",
    "<S> the first two methods , comparison of up and down spectral shape and comparison of up and down interaction rate are insensitive to most systematic errors in the neutrino flux calculations . </S>",
    "<S> for example they are insensitive to the normalization uncertainty , the @xmath6 to @xmath9 ratio uncertainty and the temporal modulation caused by the solar wind s impact on the earth s magnetosphere . </S>",
    "<S> they may be influenced by geomagnetic effects that produce modest variations of the neutrino flux at various points on earth . </S>",
    "<S> the downward neutrino component is produced locally and so is sensitive to local magnetic field properties .    </S>",
    "<S> the result of @xcite can be extended by comparing the _ rate _ of upward going to downward going @xmath6 interactions . for the range of @xmath1 of greatest interest for the super kamioka@xcite results one would expect a two to one rate difference@xcite .    for the data of reference </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the up to down event ratio is @xmath10 where the bound is the 90% confidence lower limit on the ratio of up to down flux . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned above , due to geomagnetic effects this ratio is expected to be less than one due to a small enhancement of the downward flux . </S>",
    "<S> we neglect the effect of the geomagnetic enhancement of the downward flux in calculating our neutrino oscillation limits . </S>",
    "<S> this makes the limits a bit conservative since any reduction in the upward relative rate due to geomagnetic effects will instead be ascribed to possible oscillation effects .    in the region @xmath11 </S>",
    "<S> ev@xmath5 where the upward neutrinos have traveled over several oscillations and the downward neutrinos have not had a chance to oscillate this bound on the ratio can be converted into a limit on @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath12 @xmath13 this is in direct conflict with the results@xcite @xmath14 within the mass range @xmath15 ev@xmath5 . a possible source of this discrepancy is a misinterpretation of their angular distribution in terms of low mass neutrino oscillations@xcite by the super kamioka collaboration .    a plot of the region excluded by this analysis and the analysis of reference@xcite is shown in figure [ excl ] . </S>",
    "<S> the section marked `` super kamioka allowed '' on the figure is not their true allowed region but an outline of the maximum range permitted for some values of @xmath1 and some values of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the super kamioka fit implies that @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ excl ] was calculated by integrating over the observed energy and distance distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> this rate analysis fails to exclude @xmath17 ev@xmath5 because the upper hemisphere starts to show evidence of oscillations ( in this low energy sample ) so the downward rate would also be reduced . </S>",
    "<S> a shape test could be used to extend the results in this area . </S>",
    "<S> ( the fact that the upward rate is not significantly _ greater _ than the downward rate permits one to exclude the range @xmath18 ev@xmath5 . to calculate detailed limits </S>",
    "<S> one must integrate over the source to detector distance since the muon decay length is comparable to the path length . ) </S>",
    "<S> the region @xmath19 is more sensitive to rate effects than our simple analytical analysis above indicated . in this mass region </S>",
    "<S> the oscillation hypothesis takes the bulk of the upward data through the maximum . </S>",
    "<S> the ripples in the figure are indications of the repeat of this effect for the second and third oscillation _ etc . </S>",
    "<S> _    these results confirm the excluded region calculated from a study of an independent sample of upward going muons by imb@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a larger sample of imb 3 contained event data@xcite is available and could be used to extend these results . with double the data sample </S>",
    "<S> the upper bound on @xmath0 would drop to 0.54 . </S>",
    "<S> the super kamioka single ring showering events @xcite should yield a limit on @xmath20 of the order of @xmath21 over a comparable range of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> precise contours depend on details of the _ measured _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9 energy distribution . </S>"
