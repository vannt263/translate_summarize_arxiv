    "since paczyski ( 1986 ; see also gott 1981 ) first proposed gravitational microlensing as a tool to detect massive astronomical compact objects ( machos ) in the galactic halo , three groups ( ogle , udalski et al .",
    "1992 ; eros , aubourg et al . 1993 ; macho , alcock et al .",
    "1993 ) independently discovered the first microlensing events , and subsequent observations detected by now more than two thousand microlensing events .",
    "gravitational microlensing has been applied to various fields of astronomy , such as the studies of galactic structure and stellar populations and the search for extra - solar planets . with increasing potential of microlensing as a versatile astrophysical tool , more advanced",
    "microlensing experiments such as highly precise follow - up observations and pixel lensing observations are currently being carried out , and next generation microlensing experiments such as astrometric microlensing observations by using the _ space interferometry mission _ @xmath2 and keck and vlt interferometers have been proposed .",
    "microlensing experiments are conducted toward very dense star fields such as the galactic bulge and the magellanic clouds .",
    "when a microlensing event occurs in these crowded fields , it is necessarily affected by the shear caused by the global distribution of mass around the lens star . @xcite",
    "have discussed the effect of a star on the macro - lensed image produced by the galaxy as a whole , often referred to as the ` chang @xmath3 refsdal lens ' .",
    "their lens model is characterized by ` convergence ' and ` shear ' : the former depends on the mass density within the beam and determines the magnification of the image , while the latter depends on the mass distribution outside of the beam and determines the distortion of the image ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "they pointed out that the configurations and the observational characteristics of macro - lensed images can be significantly affected by a single star .",
    "however , their work considered quasar lensing under shear , and focused only on the image configurations . in this paper",
    ", we investigate how the shear affects the stellar microlensing light curves and the astrometric centroid shift trajectories .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first introduce a single point - mass microlensing in @xmath42 to compare with the point - mass lensing with shear in @xmath43.1 . in @xmath43.2 and @xmath43.3",
    ", we discuss the distortions in the micro - lensed light curves and centroid shift trajectories in the presence of the shear . in @xmath44 , we discuss possible applications to galactic microlensing experiments . in @xmath45 , we summarize the results and conclude .",
    "microlensing occurs when a lensing mass passes very close to the line of sight to a background source star . when the lensing mass is a single point mass , the source star splits into two images .",
    "the separation between the two images is of the order of the einstein radius , which is related to the physical parameters of the lens system by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the mass of the lens , @xmath7 and @xmath8 the distances from the observer to the lens and source , respectively , and @xmath9 the distance from the lens to the source .",
    "the angular positions of the images with respect to the lens are @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the projected lens - source separation vector in units of the @xmath12 , @xmath13 the impact parameter , @xmath14 the time of maximum amplification .",
    "the einstein ring radius crossing time or the einstein time scale , @xmath15 , is given by ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath16 where @xmath17 @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the relative source - lens parallax and proper motion , respectively .",
    "the magnification of each individual image is given by @xmath20,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the magnification factors of the major and minor images , respectively .",
    "the position of the center of light ( centroid ) corresponds to the magnification - weighted mean of image positions , i.e. @xmath23 with @xmath24 is the total magnification .",
    "the centroid shift @xmath25 is defined as the difference between the image centroid @xmath26 and the unlensed source position @xmath27 , and is related to the lensing parameters by @xmath28 the position of the centroid shift caused by a single point - mass lensing follows an ellipse @xcite , which is represented by @xmath29 where the @xmath30 and @xmath31 represent the centroid shift parallel and normal to the lens - source transverse motion , respectively .",
    "the semi - major axis @xmath32 and semi - minor axis @xmath33 depend on the impact parameter @xmath13 as @xmath34",
    "when a source is lensed by a point mass @xmath35 plus planar mass distribution , the lens equation becomes ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath36 where the two - dimensional vectors @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the positions of the images and the unlensed source , respectively . the vector @xmath37 in the lens ( image ) plane is normalized by @xmath39 and the vector @xmath38 in the source plane by @xmath40 .",
    "the scaled deflection angle @xmath41 due to the additional mass distribution in the lens plane is given by the gradient of the deflection potential @xmath42 : @xmath43 where @xmath44 here @xmath45 represents the surface mass density @xmath46 normalized by the critical surface mass density @xmath47 , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the distance from the observer to the planar mass distribution , which is in general different from @xmath7 , the distance to the point mass @xmath6 , and similarly for @xmath50 .",
    "when the mass distribution consists of a stellar mass and a much larger - scale extended mass distribution , the lens equation is approximated by a point mass plus quadrupole lens model",
    "( chang & refsdal 1984 ; see also kovner 1987 ) , @xmath51 the quadrupole term is specified by the convergence @xmath52 and the shear @xmath53 .",
    "these quantities are the two - dimensional second derivatives of @xmath54 : @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the partial derivative of @xmath54 with respect to @xmath58 , @xmath59 if we define the rescaled coordinates @xmath60 and @xmath61 as @xmath62 equation @xmath63 becomes @xmath64 where @xmath65 and the reduced shear @xmath66 is @xmath67 for convenience , @xmath66 will be referred simply as the shear henceforth .    in order to solve the lens equation , we introduce the polar coordinates @xmath68 in the lens plane : @xmath69 and @xmath70",
    ". then equation ( 19 ) becomes @xmath71 which yields a fourth - order equation for @xmath72 @xcite , @xmath73r^6\\nonumber \\\\ + [ \\lambda^2 + 4\\lambda+1+\\varepsilon2(s_x^2+\\lambda s_y^2)]r^4\\nonumber \\\\",
    "-[\\varepsilon2(\\lambda+1)+s_x^2+s_y^2]r^2 + 1=0\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we solve equation ( 23 ) by laguerre s method .",
    "equation ( 23 ) has either zero , two , or four real roots , each of which corresponds to the position of the individual image .",
    "the jacobian matrix of equation ( 19 ) is @xmath74 whose determinant is @xmath75\\;.\\ ] ] the magnification of each individual image is @xmath76 the total magnification is the sum of the magnifications of individual images , @xmath77 . in order to quantify how much the light curve in the presence of shear deviates from that in the absence of shear , we define the excess magnification as @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 represent the magnifications with and without shear , respectively . in figure 1",
    ", we present the contour maps of magnification @xmath79 ( left panels ) and excess magnification @xmath81 ( right panels ) as a function of source position ( @xmath82 ) for @xmath83 @xmath84 and @xmath0 , respectively . the caustics appear as the central diamonds in the left panel of figure 1 , whose full width on the @xmath30-axis is @xmath85 and that on the @xmath31-axis is @xmath86 @xcite . when the source is outside the caustic , i.e. @xmath87 , the number of images is two as in the simple lensing without shear .",
    "the series solution of equation ( 23 ) can be derived under the assumption @xmath88 .",
    "the excess magnification @xmath81 is calculated in powers of @xmath89 , and the leading term yields @xmath90 although other geometric configurations will yield different values , the order of magnitude of the deviation will be the same , @xmath91 .",
    "this shows that even very small shear can produce a significant deviation in the light curve if the impact parameter is small enough , that is in high - magnification events .",
    "we now investigate the light curves for typical source trajectories .",
    "since the trajectory of the source does not coincide with the direction of the shear in general , we choose source trajectories with various angles ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . figure 2 shows the angle @xmath92 defined as the angle between the @xmath30-axis and the source trajectory . the dotted ring around the lens ( its position marked by ` @xmath93 ' ) is the einstein ring . in the left panel of figure 3 ,",
    "we present the lensing light curves for the corresponding source trajectories marked in figure 2 with values of the shear @xmath94 0.01 , 0.005 , 0.001 , and @xmath94 0.0 ( no shear ) .",
    "all light curves have the same impact parameter , @xmath95 . the minimum magnification @xmath79 is greater than the minimum of @xmath80 by a factor @xmath96 for @xmath97",
    "this is because the brightness of the source is increased by the shear alone even in the absence of the point - mass lens . in the right panel of figure 3 , we present the magnitude and pattern of @xmath81 for various shear values and source trajectories .",
    "we find that the excess magnification increases as @xmath66 increases and the excess becomes maximum when the source trajectory is parallel to the shear direction ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "even if the light curves have the same shear and the impact parameter , the positions and heights of the peak deviations vary with @xmath92 .",
    "we find that the value of maximum @xmath81 decreases as source trajectory becomes perpendicular to the shear direction ( @xmath99 ) . we also find that unless the source trajectory is parallel or perpendicular to the shear direction , the deviation @xmath81 becomes asymmetric in the presence of the shear .    in real observations of microlensing ,",
    "however , each light curve will be first fitted by a theoretical microlensing light curve such as the paczyski curve .",
    "so we check how the light variation induced by the presence of shear deviates from the single mass lensing curve . in paczyski curve ,",
    "the peak amplification @xmath100 is a simple function of the impact parameter @xmath13 , @xmath101^{-1/2}\\;.\\ ] ] we compare the light curve in the presence of shear with the paczyski curve that has the same peak magnification @xmath100 at @xmath102 against the background magnification due to the shear alone , @xmath103 .",
    "the impact parameter @xmath104 ( eq . [ 28 ] ) from the fitted paczyski curve is always slightly smaller than the true impact parameter @xmath13 because shear increases the maximum magnification .",
    "the detailed shapes of the deviations from the paczyski curve for various @xmath66 and @xmath92 are shown in figure 4 .",
    "as expected from the figure 3 , the light curve becomes asymmetric in the presence of the shear when the source trajectory is not parallel or perpendicular to the direction of the shear . by fitting the deviation from paczyski curve with an appropriate lens model with shear ,",
    "it is possible , in principle , to determine the magnitude and the direction of the shear if the photometric accuracy is good enough to measure the deviation . in real observations , the light curve as a whole",
    "will be fitted by the paczyiski curve , and the shape and the maximum value of the deviation can be somewhat smaller than that from the simple fitting of the maximum amplification .",
    "we define the centroid shift by @xmath105 where @xmath106 @xmath107 is the position of the image that would result from the shear alone in the absence of the point mass , i.e. @xmath108 .",
    "when microlensing occurs in the presence of shear , astrometric observations will measure @xmath109 . from equations ( 18 ) and ( 22 )",
    ", we see that @xmath110 which shows the whole field is sheared even before stellar microlensing occurs .",
    "this affects the observed proper motion of the source as well as the estimate of the lensing parameters .",
    "if the source proper motion increases by the factor @xmath111 , the einstein ring radius crossing time would change to @xmath112    the trajectories of @xmath109 in units of @xmath12 are shown in figure 5 for given @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the left panel shows the change of centroid shift trajectories depending on @xmath92 and @xmath66 .",
    "the centroid shift trajectories ( @xmath115 ) deviate from a simple astrometric ellipse ( @xmath116 ) , and both the shape and the magnitude of the distortion vary with @xmath92 and @xmath66 .",
    "the right panel of figure 5 shows the variation of the centroid shift trajectory depending on the impact parameter @xmath13 .",
    "the trajectories of centroid shift for different @xmath13 in the presence of the shear are different from each other .",
    "the shape becomes more complex and the distortion increases as @xmath13 decreases .",
    "the distortion becomes very large for small values of @xmath13 even when the shear is small .    to quantify the deviation of the centroid shift trajectory",
    ", we calculate the excess centroid shift defined as @xmath117 where @xmath109 and @xmath25 represent the centroid shifts with and without shear , respectively .",
    "the deviation @xmath118 is really the deviation from the centroid shift ellipse which is expected in a point mass lensing without shear .",
    "the trajectories of @xmath118 are shown in the left panel of figure 6 .",
    "the arrow in each panel shows the direction of the centroid motion with the progress of time .",
    "all excess centroid shifts have one twist .",
    "this is similar to the planet - induced microlensing centroid shift @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the excess centroid shift defined as @xmath119 is shown in the right panel of figure 6 .",
    "we find that major deviation occurs when @xmath120 , as expected .",
    "the sign of @xmath121 can be either positive or negative .",
    "the detailed shape of @xmath121 as a function of @xmath122 depends on @xmath92 . for intermediate values of @xmath92 ,",
    "e.g. , @xmath123 or @xmath124 , @xmath121 changes its sign near @xmath102 .",
    "we further investigate the magnitude of the maximum distortion , @xmath125 , and the time of maximum distortion , @xmath126 .",
    "figure 7a shows how @xmath125 in units of @xmath12 varies as a function of @xmath66 for different values of @xmath92 and @xmath13 . for small enough value of @xmath66",
    ", @xmath127 increases linearly as @xmath128 increases . for a given @xmath66 ,",
    "@xmath125 becomes maximum when @xmath129 and @xmath130 and minimum when @xmath131 .",
    "figure 7b shows the dependence of @xmath125 on @xmath13 for given @xmath66 and @xmath131 .",
    "figure 8a and 8b show @xmath126 in units of @xmath15 as a function of @xmath66 for different @xmath92 and @xmath13 , which figure 8c shows the dependence of @xmath126 on @xmath13 .",
    "for each @xmath92 and @xmath13 , @xmath126 is nearly constant , independent of @xmath66 .",
    "since @xmath13 can be determined from the centroid shift trajectory , @xmath66 can be determined from the @xmath125 ( fig .",
    "7a ) and @xmath92 from @xmath126 ( fig . 8a ) .",
    "therefore , it is possible to determine the shear and its direction if we determine by astrometry both the time @xmath126 and the magnitude of the maximum astrometric distortion @xmath125 . needless to say , one can always fit the full lensing ( with shear ) model to each individual case , and determine the shear and its direction .    as in @xmath132",
    ", we can also calculate the series expressions for @xmath121 in powers of @xmath89 under the same assumption : @xmath133\\ ] ] where @xmath134 and @xmath135 the time of maximum distortion , @xmath126 , is given by a root of the equation @xmath136 this equation has three real roots , and the one with the smallest absolute value corresponds to @xmath126 .",
    "the angle @xmath92 is now @xmath137.\\ ] ] hence , we can also approximately determine @xmath89 and its direction @xmath92 from equations ( 34 ) and ( 38 ) from @xmath126 and @xmath125 .",
    "now we discuss galactic microlensing affected by the shear . consider a microlensing system that consists of a single lensing star under a shear .",
    "the shear field can be produced by any galactic sub - structures such as globular clusters and the galactic bulge . here , we only consider the galactic bulge and globular clusters as typical examples of the shear , and model their mass distribution as a point mass or the plummer s model . the galactic bulge is significantly extended along the line of sight and",
    ", therefore , the mass distribution has to be weighted by the factor @xmath138 and projected along the line of sight ; the bulge mass distribution located near the source plane contributes little while those near the half of the distance to the source contributes most .",
    "but in this work we model the bulge as a planar mass distribution at the same distance as that of the lensing star for simplicity .",
    "point mass : when the lensed images are located far from the source of the shear , the shear field may be approximated by that produced by a point mass . when the mass distribution consists of a lens with mass @xmath6 located at the origin of the coordinate and an additional mass with mass @xmath139 located at @xmath140 ( in units of @xmath141 ) , the ( additional ) deflection potential @xmath54 in equation ( 12 ) becomes @xmath142 shear @xmath53 and convergence @xmath52 are calculated from equation ( 15 ) : @xmath143 convergence disappears ( @xmath144 ) because the beam is empty , and the reduced shear is equal to the shear , @xmath145 .",
    "plummer s model : as an example of extended mass distribution , we choose the plummer s model that approximates the surface mass distribution of a globular cluster @xcite . in the plummer s model ,",
    "the surface mass density is expressed as @xmath146 ^ 2}\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath139 is the total mass and @xmath147 is the core length in units of @xmath141 .",
    "the radius @xmath148 containing half the total mass is equal to 1.3048@xmath147 .",
    "then , the deflection potential @xmath54 due to the plummer s mass distribution centered at @xmath140 becomes @xmath149 @xmath150^{1/2}\\;.\\ ] ] again , @xmath53 and @xmath52 are calculated from equation ( 15 ) : @xmath151 and @xmath152 unlike the point mass case , the convergence @xmath52 is not zero because there is mass within the beam .",
    "figure 9a shows the values of @xmath66 and @xmath52 as functions of the distance from the center of the mass distribution when the shear is produced by the galactic bulge with a total mass of @xmath153 @xmath154 and located at 8.5 kpc from the earth .",
    "we assume that the lens star of @xmath155 is also located at 8.5 kpc and the source star at 9.5 kpc .",
    "solid curve represents @xmath66 when the bulge is modeled as a point mass while dotted curve as the plummer s model with @xmath156 pc .",
    "dashed curve shows @xmath52 for the plummer s model .",
    "figure 9b is the same as figure 9a for a @xmath157 @xmath154 globular cluster at @xmath158 kpc with @xmath159 pc , 1 @xmath154 lens star at the same 4 kpc , and a source star at @xmath160 kpc .",
    "hence , we expect the shear @xmath66 produced by typical globular clusters or the galactic bulge to be in the range of @xmath161 .    shown in figure 10a is the maximum distortion of the centroid shift in arcseconds when a microlensing event occurs in the galactic bulge .",
    "if future astrometric observation can achieve the positional accuracy down to @xmath162 micro - arcsec , then @xmath163 shear field can be detected in very high magnification events with @xmath164 .",
    "when a microlensing event occurs near a globular cluster ( fig .",
    "10b ) , @xmath165 shear field can be detected for events with @xmath166 .",
    "on the other hand , in order to detect the deviation of a typical light curve for @xmath167 and @xmath168 , photometric accuracy should be better than @xmath169 .",
    "although we may be able to measure the shear in microlensing events , the measurement alone does not tell us about the source of the shear .",
    "the shear may be from the galactic sub - structures , but it can also be from many other objects .",
    "the most obvious source is the binary companion .",
    "a binary companion at a typical distance of @xmath170 au ( duquennoy & mayor 1991 ) will produce a shear close to @xmath171 , two to three orders of magnitude larger than the shear by the galactic bulge .",
    "the distribution of the binary period and the mass ratio ( duquennoy & mayor 1991 ) implies 85% of all binary companions will produce @xmath172 . so the shear due to binary companion will dominate or be comparable to the shear expected from galactic sub - structures . the shear can be also produced by planetary companions .",
    "planets detected in the current microlensing experiments produce shear in the range @xmath173 .",
    "a typical earth - mass planet at a distance of @xmath174 ( @xmath175 au for 1 @xmath154 ) from the lens produces @xmath176 , while pluto - mass planet at a distance @xmath177 produces @xmath178 .",
    "projected companion stars , unassociated but located near the lensing star in the projected sky , will also affect lensing similarly .",
    "hence , in practice it will be difficult to identify the shear by galactic sub - structures against the shear by companion stars .",
    "still , there can be some microlensing events that are not affected by companion star or in which the shear by galactic sub - structure may be measured from the statistical analysis of many events as in cosmological weak lensing systems .",
    "there may also be cases for which we may set an upper limit on the value of the shear .",
    "a very small upper limit on shear suggests the non - existence of a binary companion or a galactic structure .",
    "for example , if we measure @xmath179 , we can expect that the lens does not have a companion with more than 95% confidence if we assume the distribution of the binary companion by duquennoy & mayor ( 1991 ) .",
    "complications in usual microlensing events , for example , blending and binary source , will also affect microlensing under shear .",
    "for example , blending decreases the deviation in the image centroid shift and the light curve ( fig .",
    "11b as compared to fig .",
    "11a ) and the binary source completely messes up the centroid shift trajectory ( fig .",
    "however , since the shape of the trajectory mainly depends on the size of the shear , fitting the full trajectory may sort our these complications .",
    "although the typical shear expected from the galactic bulge or globular clusters is too small or the clear case that enables the determination of shear is too infrequent to be comfortably detected by current or near - future microlensing experiments , next generation microlensing experiments may enable us to measure the magnitude and the direction of even smaller shear fields among numerous microlensing events . then , from the theoretical framework of weak lensing , the shear map can be inverted to reproduce the mass distribution ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , making it possible to map or at least constrain the galactic mass distribution . since all our discussions are based on normalized units , the reproduced mass distribution will be in units of @xmath47 per @xmath180 .",
    "if @xmath8 and @xmath7 are additionally determined , the mass distribution can be determined in physical units .",
    "we investigated microlensing under a shear , which might be produced by galactic sub - structures such as globular clusters or the galactic bulge .",
    "we analyzed its effect on the microlensing light curves and astrometric centroid shift trajectories .",
    "we found the followings :    \\1 .",
    "the light curve deviation from the paczyski curve increases as the shear increases and the impact parameter decreases . the positions and heights of the maximum deviation vary depending on the direction of the source trajectory :",
    "the light curve becomes asymmetric if the source trajectory is not parallel or perpendicular to the shear direction .",
    "the centroid shift trajectory in the presence of shear deviates from a simple ellipse , especially when the source is within the einstein ring .",
    "the magnitude of the maximum distortion depends on shear and its direction , and becomes largest when the trajectory is parallel or perpendicular to the shear direction .",
    "the time of maximum distortion is nearly independent of the impact parameter .",
    "the distortion of the centroid shift trajectory increases as the impact parameter decreases and the shape becomes very complex when the impact parameter is very small .",
    "the magnitude of the shear produced by the galactic bulge or globular clusters near the galactic center is of the order of @xmath0 to @xmath1 in normalized units .",
    "this shear , in principle , could be detected by future microlensing experiments , especially in high magnification events .",

    "we also thank dong wook lee and cheongho han for careful reading of the manuscript .",

    "<S> the centroid shift trajectory also deviates from a simple ellipse in the presence of shear . </S>",
    "<S> the distortion of the centroid shift trajectory increases as the impact parameter decreases , and the shape of the trajectory becomes complicated when the impact parameter becomes small enough . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the maximum distortion depends on the magnitude and the direction of the shear . for a source trajectory in a given direction </S>",
    "<S> , the time of the maximum distortion depends mostly on the impact parameter and hardly on the shear . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to determine the magnitude of the shear and its direction if both the time and the magnitude of the maximum astrometric distortion are measured . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the shear produced by the galactic bulge or a globular cluster falls in the range @xmath0@xmath1 in normalized units . </S>",
    "<S> although the actual determination of the shear from the galactic sub - structures will not be easy due to complications such as binary companion , future large scale microlensing experiments may enable us to determine the shear in some high amplification events , leading eventually to mapping the galactic mass distribution . </S>"
