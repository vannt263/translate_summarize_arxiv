    "dark energy is mysterious dark component responsible for accelerated expansion of the universe became an object of numerous studies in the last two decades .",
    "there are many possible explanations @xcite , @xcite of the nature of dark energy .",
    "one of the most promising among them is scalar field dark energy , which can be modelled as perfect fluid .",
    "in fact , having just a few parameters - the density @xmath4 , the equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath5 and effective speed of sound @xmath6 , this model can perfectly explain latest cosmological observational data ( @xcite , @xcite ) , keeping a large volume of parameters space of possible values .",
    "therefore , it would be interesting to study behaviour of perturbations of such dark energy on non - cosmological scales .",
    "this may yield more constrains on parameters of the model .",
    "it was already shown @xcite , @xcite that non - linear perturbations of scalar field dark energy can in principle influence structure formation even on galaxy scales .",
    "finally , in the last decade there was a number of papers ( see @xcite for review ) , that studied accretion of dark energy on compact objects ( black holes mainly ) in hydrodynamical approach . in our works",
    "@xcite we have shown that nevertheless such stationary accretion does not change the gravitating mass of the central object , in principle , it can give detectable contribution to dynamics of bodies in its vicinity , which would be possible to extract from current observations .",
    "here we analyse the dynamics of dark energy in the collapsing halo of dark matter . in the next chapter",
    "we present the system of equations , which we use to solve the problem of evolution of spherical scalar perturbations in 3-component expanding universe from early linear stage to highly non - linear one , when dark matter halo forms . in the last chapter we present numerical solutions and discuss their main features .",
    "we suppose that the universe is spatially flat and filled by matter ( @xmath7 ) , dark energy ( @xmath8 ) and radiation ( @xmath9 ) , the metric of the background space - time is friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) one . each component is described in the perfect fluid approximation by energy density @xmath10 , pressure @xmath11 and four - velocity @xmath12 . the equation of state for each component can be presented as @xmath13 , with @xmath14 for matter , @xmath15 for radiation and @xmath16 for dark energy .",
    "we assume that dark energy is scalar field with @xmath17 .",
    "the goal of the paper is analysis the evolution of spherical halo from the linear stage in the early radiation dominated epoch , through the turnaround point to highly non - linear stage , infall of matter before virialization , at dark energy dominated epoch .",
    "the local spherical perturbation distorts the frw metric , so that it becomes @xmath18,\\label{ds_sph}\\ ] ] where the metric functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 vanish at cosmological background . at the linear stage , when @xmath21 the metric ( [ ds_sph ] ) becomes the metric of conformal - newtonian ( longitudinal ) gauge @xcite in spherical coordinates , since @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "we rewrite the energy - momentum tensor of dark energy , @xmath24 , in terms of proper 3-velocity of fluid @xmath25 ( measured in local frame ) , which has only radial component .",
    "the relation between components of 4-velocity @xmath26 and 3-velocity @xmath25 of fluid are as follows @xmath27 where @xmath25 is in the units of speed of light .",
    "the non - zero components of energy - momentum tensor are @xmath28 we decompose both density and pressure on background averaged and perturbed parts as @xmath29 , @xmath30 , where density perturbation of each component is defined as @xmath31 .",
    "we study the model of dark energy , for which both @xmath32 and @xmath33 are constant .",
    "the integral term in the pressure decomposition comes from non - adiabatic part of pressure perturbation of scalar field dark energy ( details can be found in papers @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of this term makes our equation of state non - barotropic , as we work in frame different from proper dark energy one and hence , relation @xmath34 holds only for averaged parts of this component . taking into account this decomposition , and keeping terms with @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 only , we obtain the following energy - momentum tensor components of dark energy : @xmath38a^{-1}v_{de}e^{(\\nu-\\mu)/2 } , \\nonumber \\\\ & & t_1 ^ 0 = -\\bar{\\varepsilon}_{de}\\left[1+w_{de}+(1+c_s^2)\\delta_{de}-3\\dot{a}(1+w_{de})(c_s^2-w_{de})\\int{e^{(\\mu-\\nu)/2}v_{de}dr}\\right]a v_{de}e^{(\\mu-\\nu)/2 } , \\label{tei2}\\\\ & & t_1 ^ 1 = - \\bar{\\varepsilon}_{de } \\left(w_{de } + c_s^2\\delta_{de } -3\\dot{a}(1+w_{de})(c_s^2-w_{de})\\int{e^{(\\mu-\\nu)/2}v_{de}dr}\\right)-\\bar{\\varepsilon}_{de}\\left(1+w_{de}+(1+c_s^2)\\delta_{de}\\right)v_{de}^2,\\nonumber\\\\ & & t_2 ^ 2 = t_3 ^ 3 = -\\bar{\\varepsilon}_{de}\\left[w_{de}+c_s^2\\delta_{de } -3\\dot{a}(1+w_{de})(c_s^2-w_{de})\\int{e^{(\\mu-\\nu)/2}v_{de}dr}\\right ] .",

    "( [ de_cl0])-([ee00 ] ) have non - relativistic limit ( appendix ) , which in case of dark matter ( @xmath55 ) coincide with well known classical hydrodynamic equations and poisson equation accordingly .",
    "we are interested in the cluster and supercluster scales of perturbations , for which @xmath56 , @xmath57 in the bulk of object , while @xmath58 in their halos .",
    "so , the equations can be essentially reduced by neglecting of the terms like , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and higher order terms .",
    "the terms with @xmath62 must be kept , since they are important at highly non - linear stage .",
    "the final reduced form of these equations , which we use in the code , can be found in our upcoming paper @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have seven 1st - order partial differential equations for seven unknown functions @xmath63 which can be solved numerically for given initial conditions .    at the early epoch the amplitudes of cosmological perturbations of space - time metric , densities and velocities are small and the eqs .",
    "( [ de_cl0])-([ee00 ] ) can be linearized for all components .",
    "moreover , we can present each function of @xmath64 as product of its amplitude , which depends on @xmath65 only , and some function of radial coordinate @xmath9 , which describes the initial profile of spherical perturbation , which can be expanded into series of some orthogonal functions , e.g. spherical ones in our case .",
    "in particular , we can present the perturbations of the metric , density and velocity of n - component as follows @xmath66 in the analysis of the evolution of central part of spherical halo we can decompose @xmath9-function in the taylor series and keep only leading terms : @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",
    "it gives the possibility to reduce the system of seven partial differential equation for unknown functions ( [ functions ] ) to the system of seven ordinary differential equations for their amplitudes @xmath69 which is presented in @xcite .",
    "we set the adiabatic initial conditions in the following way . to find the relations between amplitudes at some @xmath70 when the scales of interested here gravitationally bound systems were essentially larger than horizon scale , @xmath71 we have used the linearization of system ( [ de_cl0])-([ee00 ] ) , which has analytical exact solution for one component universe .",
    "obviously , that for cluster and supercluster scales it was early radiation - dominated epoch , when @xmath72 , so , the matter and dark energy can be treated as test components .",

    "in this section we present the results of numerical integrations of the described system of equations .",
    "for that we have designed the fortran-95 program based on open ` dverk.f ` package for odes , in which time depended functions are replaced by scale - factor depended , since @xmath81 is well defined for given cosmology .",

    "non - linearity becomes noticeable already at @xmath84 .",
    "one can note , that in all cases and for all sets of parameters analysed here dark energy is subdominant always : density of its perturbations is few orders lower then of dark matter s ones .",
    "the reason of this is the large absolute value of pressure which keeps it from collapse .",
    "large values of effective speed of sound ( that is , speed of ( also ) pressure perturbation distribution ) forces dark energy to oscillate after perturbation enters the horizon ( figs .",

    "effective speed of sound , the pressure gradient of dark energy decreases counteraction to gravity .",
    "the oscillation became smaller and even disappear at some really small values of @xmath90 and the perturbations grow faster , time evolution of velocity and density become more and more similar to the matter s one .",
    "this fact is in good concordance with character of dependence on effective speed of sound during accretion of dark energy on compact object , that we studied recently @xcite . as can be seen from fig .",
    "f ) , when @xmath91 the dark energy and dark matter has always the same velocity and the gap between their densities is constant and @xmath89 which is velocity factor in the continuity equation for dark energy ( [ de_cl0 ] ) .    these two features , together with the fact , that dark energy background density is smaller than other components in the past , imply , that dark energy could influence significantly on the process of dark matter hallo collapse only having specific parameters - very small value of effective speed of sound .",
    "the current cosmological observational data do not exclude such models of dark energy ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is also interesting to point out , that predictions of the linear ( doted lines ) and non - linear theories at smaller scale for density and velocity become distinguishable approximately at the same time ( scale factor ) as for larger scale , however , for potential , linear and non - linear theories diverge only at late times for smaller scale .",
    "the reason for is , that initial perturbations where taken different for these scales , to have approximately the same density perturbation at @xmath92 .",
    "for the same initial amplitudes the perturbations of smaller scales would collapse first .",
