    "the sequence @xmath270 corresponds to the subdivision of one plaquette .",

    "@xmath149 _ _  exists if a sequence of functions is found satisfying ( [ 5.6 ] ) for plaquette subdivisions of all sizes .",
    "notice that :    - eq.([5.6 ] ) is not necessarily a convolution semigroup property because @xmath269 and @xmath262 might be different functions and ( [ 5.6 ] ) is a proportionality relation , not an equality .",
    "- the interaction measure may not be absolutely continuous with respect to the kinematical measure @xmath139 , constructed in sect.2 , because not all functions in the sequence ( mostly in the small scale limit ) might be continuous functions .",
    "although ( [ 5.6 ] ) is not exactly a convolution semigroup property , functions satisfying this condition may be obtained out of convolution semigroup kernels .",
    "three cases will be separately analyzed , namely @xmath273 .",
    "an important convolution semigroup in @xmath275 @xmath276is the heat kernel semigroup @xmath277which , by convolution with any initial condition @xmath278 , provides a solution to the @xmath279heat equation @xmath280let us now use the @xmath279heat kernel in ( [ 5.8 ] ) with @xmath281to check the condition ( [ 5.6 ] ) .",

    "therefore , using the heat kernel as the density of the measure , a consistent measure is constructed in the projective limit .    an important consideration in establishing measures for the gauge spaces is to check whether , in the small scales , these measures correspond ( or not ) to the measures used by physicists for the same phenomena . in the @xmath286 case",
    "this is easily seen by rewriting the heat kernel using the jacobi identity @xmath287then , at very small scales @xmath284 becomes extremely small .",
    "therefore in the sum of ( [ 5.13 ] ) only the @xmath288 and the @xmath289 neighborhood contribute and , for the plaquette , one obtains a density proportional to @xmath290which indeed corresponds to the usual ( small scale ) @xmath279measure .    in the lattice",

    "one sees that for small @xmath284 ( small scales ) the measure concentrates around @xmath301 .",

    "now one checks the consistency of the result with the physical small scale ( small @xmath284 ) limit .",
    "inspection of ( [ 5.30 ] ) leads to the conclusion that for @xmath325 the sums become dominated by the @xmath349 term and the neighborhood @xmath350",
    ". then @xmath351from ( [ 5.29 ] ) one also sees that for small @xmath352@xmath353which , equating with ( [ 5.25 ] ) , leads to @xmath354that is , up to an irrelevant constant factor ( to be absorbed in the measure normalization ) , one also obtains in the @xmath355 case the usual physical measure in the @xmath292 limit .",
    "therefore , both for @xmath356 and @xmath315 , one may take the measures so constructed as a definition of the yang - mills measure .    for small @xmath284 the measure is always concentrated in the neighborhood @xmath357 .",
    "let @xmath24 be the stabilizer ( isotropy group ) of a generalized connection @xmath358@xmath359the action of the gauge group @xmath9 on @xmath7 leads to a stratification of @xmath7 corresponding to the classes of equivalent _ orbits _",
    "the _ stratum _ @xmath27 of @xmath28 is the set of connections having isotropy groups @xmath10conjugated to that of @xmath28@xmath361the _ configuration space of the gauge theory _ is the quotient space @xmath30 and therefore a stratum is the set of points in @xmath30 that correspond to orbits with conjugated isotropy groups .",
    "when @xmath1 is a compact group the stratification is topologically regular .",
    "the map that , to each orbit , assigns the conjugacy class of its isotropy group is called the _ type_. the set of strata carries a partial ordering of types , @xmath362 with @xmath363 if there are representatives @xmath364 and @xmath365 of the isotropy groups such that @xmath366 .",
    "the maximal element in the ordering of types is the class of the center @xmath367 of @xmath1 and the minimal one is the class of @xmath1 itself .",
    "furthermore @xmath368 is open and @xmath369 is open in the relative topology in @xmath370 .    because the isotropy group of a connection is isomorphic to the centralizer of its holonomy group , the strata are in one - to - one correspondence with the howe subgroups of @xmath1 , that is , the subgroups that are centralizers of some subset in @xmath1 .",
    "given an holonomy group @xmath371 associated to a connection @xmath28 of type @xmath372 , the stratum of @xmath28 is classified by the conjugacy class of the isotropy group @xmath364 , that is , the centralizer of @xmath371 @xmath373an important role is also played by the centralizer of the centralizer @xmath374that contains @xmath371 itself . if @xmath375 is a proper subgroup of @xmath1 , the connection @xmath28 reduces locally to the subbundle @xmath376",

    "because adjoint transformations transform any radius into any other , all @xmath279bundles are equivalent and represent the same gauge configurations .",
    "finally , the ( generic ) stratum 1 corresponds to homomorphisms to arbitrary @xmath314 transformations .    from ( [ 5.21 ] ) one sees that the intensity of the measure ( [ 5.20 ] ) only depends on the first term @xmath390 in the parameterization ( [ 7.6 ] ) .",
    "therefore all strata approach the small @xmath391 region where the measure is peaked and therefore they all are expected to be relevant in the physical behavior of the gauge theory .",

    "therefore , for the full projective limit , the interaction measure is not absolutely continuous with respect to the kinematical measure . that such a result was to be expected , follows also from the analysis of fleischhak fleischhack1 @xcite who , starting from very general conditions concluded that in gauge theories there is a `` breakdown of the action method '' .",
