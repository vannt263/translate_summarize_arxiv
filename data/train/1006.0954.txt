    "experimental work in a physics curriculum needs a good understanding of physical theory and hopefully helps to achieve to understand the same physics .",
    "mastery of technological tools that allow the control and measurement of physical phenomena play a key role in the experimental process .",
    "the tools range from the most simple ( a voltmeter for instance ) to specialized equipment .",
    "a common tool that is encountered in many laboratories is the oscilloscope , from the first year electricity lab to advanced research labs .",
    "while the oscilloscope allows a direct measurement of many quantities , a non - trivial task is the automated measurement of a transistor s characteristics.@xcite dedicated circuit have been devised however to make the process possible @xcite as well as commercial curve tracers .",
    "the measurement of characteristics is a basic experiment in introductory electronics courses and we will use it as an example , in association with a digital storage oscilloscope ( dso ) . despite the commonness of dsos , few articles in physics journal are dedicated to its use ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "we propose in this article a setup to analyze the data on a computer via inexpensive means  : a usb stick and open - source software .",
    "the motivation behind this choice is two - fold  : the cost is negligible once a suitable oscilloscope is available in the lab and the software is available for all the students to perform the analysis on whichever computer they use .",
    "we use a tektronix tds-1001b dso , but any oscilloscope with the ability to write files on a usb device should work , and a function generator .",
    "the setup is made via the `` save / recall '' button . while we refer the reader to the manual for the setup , here is what we expect to find after a push on the `` print '' key  : a folder on the usb drive with one csv file per channel , a setup file and a screenshot of the scope .",
    "the screenshot allows one to visually identify a measure .",
    "it is however necessary to take note of the folder name that appears on the screen and to associate it with a given experiment .",
    "once a file is written to the usb device , one can read it on the computer .",
    "the csv file can be used with common spreadsheet programs for instance , but we propose to use an open - source library that can be readily be installed by the students at no cost .",
    "all the file operations , computations and plotting will be made with the help of python and matplotlib,@xcite a plotting library .",
    "all the code necessary to perform the work presented in this article is available in the supplementary material to this article , as well as the data files .",
    "we illustrate however the core commands issued to obtain the results in order to emphasize the simplicity offered by this solution  : in a terminal , one needs to go to the directory in which the data files reside , then launch python and load the libraries with ( the `` ` > > > ` '' represents the python shell )  :    .... > > > from matplotlib.mlab import csv2rec > > > from pylab import * > > > ion ( ) ....    the channels are loaded separately via the commands    ....",

    "the transistor under test is here a 2n2219a npn transistor .     and @xmath1 .",
    "]      the measurement of the base - emitter ( be ) characteristic is based on the voltage across the be junction of the transistor and on the current @xmath5 flowing through the base .",
    "@xmath5 is measured as the voltage drop across the resistance @xmath6 divided by @xmath6 as the oscilloscope can not measure directly a current .",
    "we expect a typical current @xmath5 that is of order @xmath2ma and use a value of @xmath7k@xmath3 .",
    "a @xmath8v voltage source is provided ( @xmath1 is set to @xmath8v ) to polarize the collector - emitter junction and the voltage source @xmath0 is a sawtooth signal of frequency @xmath9hz and a voltage of @xmath10v to @xmath2v .",
    "a single period of the signal is sufficient to collect the complete characteristic , as it allows a sweep of @xmath11 from @xmath10 to about @xmath12v .",

    "as soon as we deviate too much from the dc polarization , imperfections will occur .",
    "an electronic course is a good introduction to the concept of modeling and to its limit , given its ability to check the theory and to see at which point it fails .",
    "we have presented in this article a simple setup allowing to take digital measurements on a transistor , giving the example of the measure of the characteristic curves .",
    "this setup represents an improvement in simplicity as compared to customized circuits found in the literature or with respect to commercial characteristic tracers .",
    "the setup is of negligible cost , apart from the dso , which is a quite common device nowadays .",
    "in addition , the use of open - source software allows the students to analyze data with no supplementary cost or to install the software freely in a computer lab .    from the pedagogical point of view",
    ", the setup we propose allows students to apprehend the physical working of a transistor with quantitative tools and observe themselves the limitations of the theory . as mentioned in the introduction , the availability of a complete experimental process and apparatus , from building the experiment to interpreting the data , _ via _ the measurement , can help tailoring students perception of modeling versus exact theory .",
    "the speed with which characteristic curves are measured and imported on the computer makes it possible to include this experiment in place of the usual step by step measurement in the introductory lab of electronics .",
    "the time spent in explaining the technicalities is compensated by the short time needed to trace a full curve in the press of a button .",
    "the generality of the setup , which allows to import easily `` real - world '' data onto the computer , will give it applications wherever an oscilloscope is useful but with a far more powerful analysis language .",
    "if desired by the teacher , the data can be re - used with stronger tools  : the computation of the frequency - response can be measured , or fft s can be performed on the computer .",
    "the author would like to acknowledge the helpful technical support from p. duhamel and m. trivilini of the physics department , support from profs p. gaspard and p. emplit and from dr n. goldman , and the enthusiasm of students along the years ."
